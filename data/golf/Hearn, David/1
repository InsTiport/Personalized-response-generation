 Q.  How would you characterize it out there today?  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, that was a pretty solid round of golf.  I felt like I gave myself some good chances on the front nine.  I didn't make a lot of the putts, so I wasn't frustrated, but I didn't get much out of the first nine holes.  Then when I got to the back nine, I made a bunch of really good par saves getting going and the putter kind of got a little hotter.   
Overall, 3-under today, it's not going to be the best round of the day, but it was a pretty solid round of golf.  The course is definitely getting harder.   
 Q.  Is it just the way it's picking up it's making it more difficult, drying it out?  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, it's getting drier.  These greens just have tricky angles.  When there is a lot of wind and getting firmer, it's hard to continue to give yourself sort of uphill, good looks at birdie.   
 Q.  What does a day like tomorrow look like when you're in the middle of the pack?  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, every day is important for me right now.  Doesn't matter tomorrow, next week or when it is.  I think I commented to everyone earlier in the week:  I'm just trying to play the best round of golf I can every day, and, you know, the rest of the FedExCup will take care of itself.   
But, no, there is no doubt if I were to have a great day tomorrow or a good day, or any kind of solid performance, it would definitely help me out in where my standing is.  But regardless I have to play some good golf between now and the end of the 2018 season.
