Q. Kind of a slow day and then all of a sudden birdies at 15 and 16 have you right in the mix.  What was going on for you out there today?DAVID HEARN: I felt like I played solid most of the day, just didn't give myself a ton of chances early.  I kept hitting good putts and just sort of burning some edges, so I just really tried to stay patient today.  Yesterday I got off to such a fast start.  I think sometimes you go into that mindset that it's going to happen every day, but today just a little bit slower getting going.  Once I got turned back around downwind again, it was a little bit easier to get the ball close to the hole.  There was an opportunity out there today because the greens weren't too firm, but overall I'm pretty happy with the way I played.Q. What's been the key to your play this week?DAVID HEARN: I think I've been giving myself a lot more chances.  My putting is usually pretty solid, and I've been doing a good job of hitting more greens and giving myself more good chances for birdie.  So if I can just continue to keep putting it in the fairway and keep hitting some greens, hopefully tomorrow I can get hot again.Q. Obviously still looking for that first win.  What's your mindset going into Sunday.DAVID HEARN: Absolutely I'll be targeting toward getting off to a good start and trying to contend for this golf tournament.  I'm only one back right now.  That might change by the end of it.  I feel like I'm playing good enough golf this week to be the champion, so tomorrow I'm going to go out with that mindset and try to play good golf.
