Q.   David, how do you feel you ran today? 
DAVID HEARN:   Obviously, I had a bad day, and I'm looking forward to a better one tomorrow.   Made a lot of mistakes out there today, but my game's still very close.   If I have a nice day tomorrow, shooting a round like J.B. did, that I played with today, I can still have a nice finish.

Q.   I guess the 14th was the big trouble? 
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, is I wasn't doing a lot of good for myself before that.   I wasn't giving myself too many chances.   Then I got a lot of lip outs and just wasn't getting the breaks today. 
So this is kind of the story of the way things went today.

Q.   What did you see from J.B.'s game?   He put himself in position now where he's going to contend here? 
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, J.B. is a great player, obviously.   It's a very long way.   He had a good day today.   I know my game is a little different than his.   So I don't play the same way he does.

Q.   You still feel like low scores look like they're continuing through the weekend here a little bit?
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, absolutely.   The greens are still very soft.   Some of the mid to long irons are holding the green very well.   So we know that's always going to lead to good scoring.   So we got lucky again with the weather today.   Hopefully we'll continue to hold off and maybe firm up a little bit tomorrow too.

Q.   I know you played a lot.   Did that factor in?   Are you feeling weary? 
DAVID HEARN:   No, I don't think so.   I've certainly tailored my practice to be ready and rested coming into this week.   I can't attribute a few bad breaks and bounces to being tired.
