  DAVID HEARN:   I got off to a nice start making a birdie early, got through 4. That's a tough hole today. Made a bogey on 5, which again, another tough hole into the wind today. I played real solid on the front nine and made a real sloppy bogey on the 9th hole and a little frustrated coming off that front side that I didn't have it more under par. I gave myself enough chances and really didn't get hot enough with the putter.
Again on the back nine I played really well, gave myself lots of chances, and it just wasn't my day on the greens, so I'll be going to put in a little time here in a minute.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, I think for me I love these types of greens. These are the types of greens that I usually putt very well on. This is what I grew up on, these types of slopey greens. I feel really good, and I feel like I'm making good reads, and I think my speed just hasn't been quite consistent enough to make a lot of putts. But that being said, still lots to play for tomorrow. It's a real tight board. If I go out and have a good day, I could really move up the board.

Q.   Slightly different winds today and pin placement, how much did that wear on the guys on the course?
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, I think the wind really wasn't too much different. It was southwest again today. But the pins are obviously getting a little bit trickier here as the week goes on. I expect them to be even more difficult tomorrow, especially on some of those longer holes. They've kind of kept them toward the middle of the green so far.
The course has really played just very fairly. It's been a good test. Obviously the wind has been a challenge, but overall I think the course has stood up very well, and I'm excited to get out tomorrow and see if I can get in a good round.
