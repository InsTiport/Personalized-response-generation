 Q.  How did it feel to shoot a five-under par 65 in your opening round?  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, it felt good.  You know, you obviously want to get off to a good start and start of 2016, so it feels to be good here in Hawaii, and I've played well around this course in the past, so it felt really good to put in a nice round today.   
 Q.  What did you do during the break?  
DAVID HEARN: I putted a lot.  I had to make a change from the anchored putting to the regular putting.  It felt good today, and hopefully we can keep it going throughout the rest of the week.   
 Q.  What was the key to your round today?  
DAVID HEARN: Early on, it seems like the first couple of holes, starting on the first hole, are tricky holes, and I got off to a nice start and kept the ball in play, hit a bunch of fairways.  This golf course isn't overly long, but hitting the fairways let's you control those shots into the greens a lot better.  And I did a good job of keeping the ball in front of me and allowing myself to be a little bit more aggressive on some of those shorter irons.
