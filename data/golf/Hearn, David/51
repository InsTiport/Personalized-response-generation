Q.   Talk about your round, 1‑under.   One of the best of the day. 
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, obviously I put myself on a big hole on the first round, I felt like my game's been a lot better than the way I played yesterday coming in and actually on Thursday. 
Today I just really focused on fairways and greens and hit a lot of really nice tee shots and gave myself a few good chances.

Q.   How tough is the course out there?
DAVID HEARN:   I think the scoring speaks for itself.   We have had a lot of rain, this is as soft as the course is going to play and leading is 1‑under.   So it's obviously playing extremely difficult.

Q.   What's the key to success or what did you find for you in terms of scoring?
DAVID HEARN:   Today?   I don't know.   I just kept giving myself chances every hole.   I think that fairways always at the U.S. Open is the most important thing and I was pretty fortunate to do that.   I don't know what to tell you.   I mean it's just fairways and greens, right, that's what this tournament's all about. 
When it firms up this weekend, it's definitely, it's not going to firm up a ton, but it's still going to make it even more difficult as the week goes on, but fairways and greens, that's what wins this tournament. 

Q.   It's got to feel good shooting a 69?
DAVID HEARN:   Feels great.   Excited to be playing two more rounds.
