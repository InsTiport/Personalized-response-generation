 Q.  Coming off a top-10 last week in the second leg of the FedExCup playoffs, a great start so far this week.  Describe what's been working for you.  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, I started to putt really well last week and I feel like my whole game's been pretty good for awhile, so it was nice to finally see some putts go in.  I obviously needed a good week last week to be here at BMW, but I'm glad to be here and nice to see my golf's continuing on and I'm playing well.  So, hopefully, I can put in another good effort here and see what I can do about getting to that TOUR Championship.   
 Q.  You had some putts go in and a heck of a chip go in to close out your first round.  Let's take a look at what we saw on the final hole.  
DAVID HEARN: This was, obviously, a great finish to a good day.  And how about that?  It went in with good speed.  I hit so many good shots all day, that was one of the only greens I missed.  But it was nice to see a chip like that go in.  So, definitely a little confidence boost going into the afternoon here.
