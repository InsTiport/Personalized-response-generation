Q.   Good round, 68.   How do you feel today?
DAVID HEARN:   Yeah, I feel great.   Obviously the course is playing better and better every day here this week.   The greens are getting faster and firmer as the week goes on, and the wind was up today, so I couldn't be more happy with the result, really.   I played solid all day.

Q.   What do you have to improve tomorrow on this course to maybe be on the leaderboard and contend?
DAVID HEARN:   You know, that's going to be up to the leaders really.   For me tomorrow if I just keep doing what I'm doing, if I put together another round like I did today, that's all I can do, and we'll see what happens.   It's up to Martin and Jordan, what they do, but I'm really happy with the way I'm playing right now, and I'm going to be doing everything I can to be playing well again tomorrow.
