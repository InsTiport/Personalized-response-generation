 Q.  Not the finish you were looking for, but still looked good today.  What needs to change tomorrow to turn this 3-under into a round of 5- or 6-under?  DAVID HEARN: Just tidy it up at the finish there.  I played solid all day.  Took advantage of the par-5s really nicely.  I'm obviously not too happy I made bogey on the last there, but I'm still within reach of the leaders.  I certainly didn't play my way out of it.  I played a solid round of golf that's what I needed to do.  So if I can hit a few more greens tomorrow, I like my chances.   Q.  The course is playing fairly easy.  It's a perfect day for conditioning.  Are you surprised at the 8-under par though?  That seems a little low.  DAVID HEARN: Yeah, I feel like this is the best condition I've ever seen Glen Abbey in, and it's nice to see it firm.  On 18 it's a short par-5 with the firmness, but it's tricky.  So you have to really keep the ball in the fairway and keep it in the right spot. So downwind shots out of the rough, you really can't hold them that well.  Obviously, my wedge there I had a hard time holding that as well.  Anyway, it's nice to see this course playing firm.  It's fun.
