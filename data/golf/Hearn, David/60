 Q.  Some thoughts on the week as a whole; with the start you had, I'm sure this isn't the finish you want. 
 DAVID HEARN:  No, I obviously didn't play quite as well as I would have liked the last three days.  But I feel like, you know, I'm doing a lot of good things and I've just got to keep working on it, and, you know, it will pay off for me down the road. 

 Q.  What wasn't going right the last few days? 
 DAVID HEARN:  Well, Friday and Saturday, I struggled on the greens a little bit, and today I just seemed to play pretty average most of the day.  I wasn't getting my wedges very close to the pin and when I had chances, I wasn't taking advantage of them. 
 Apart from that, I didn't play too badly today.  I hit a lot of fairways, and, you know, I gave myself lots of opportunities off the tee, which is always important. 

 Q.  What do you take out of this and to the Nationwide Tour -- 
 DAVID HEARN:  I'm not sure exactly.  I know my game is good, I still know that, and it will be good for me to get back out in Wichita and get back into contention. 

 Q.  If there is a difference between David Hearn two years ago and David Hearn now? 
 DAVID HEARN:  I think maybe my patience is a little better.  I come into these events trying to make things happen right away.  A week like this isn't going to get me down at all.  I know there will be other Canadian Opens and I'll be better. 

 Q.  Is your temperament okay? 
 DAVID HEARN:  I think so.  I think I'm a more consistent player now than I was before and I don't try and force that. 

 Q.  Your thoughts going to Q-School, you look back on what happened the last time or do you look forward? 
 DAVID HEARN:  Q-School?  I'm not going to Q-School.
