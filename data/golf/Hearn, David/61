 Q.  General feeling, felt like there were a couple of missed scores, general consensus? 
 DAVID HEARN:  Absolutely.  Today was a day that would have been a good day for me to move up the board a little bit.  I'm pretty disappointed but I'll go work on it a little bit and hopefully tomorrow come out and shoot a nice number to finish off the tournament. 

 Q.  Problems with your short game? 
 DAVID HEARN:  I don't even know, if the chipping has been good, just for some reason, the short ones are not going in.  Occasionally a bad stroke but sometimes they are just bumpy like on 18, but, oh, well, that's the way it goes sometimes.
