  DAVID HEARN:   Went right at it.   A pretty tucked pin.   188 yards, converted down to 184.   Hit a 6-iron.   It landed perfectly, and as far as we could tell, it went in like a putt.   Just picture perfect hole-in-one.   I was excited to make one here.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember the last time you had one?  
DAVID HEARN:   It was in a practice round here on No. 8 with the same club.  
   
 Q.   How long ago?  
DAVID HEARN:   That was about three, four years ago.  
   
 Q.   How many do you think you have in your life?  
DAVID HEARN:   I know I have eight.   So, yeah, that's my -- it's my fifth in competition.   So, my first on the PGA.   Exciting.   It's been awhile.  
   
 Q.   One of those as you're watching it fly that you go like, hey, this could get interesting?  
DAVID HEARN:   I hit a good shot and knew it was going to be close.   And we were the first group of the day.   I was the first shot of the day on that hole.   So my group members were telling it to go in.   And I was just sort of watching it, and we heard the roars from up at the green, just the volunteers, weren't any spectators out when we got there, you know.   It was fun.   It was a great start to the day, very nice.  
  
 Q. Swafford hit one later on 14.
