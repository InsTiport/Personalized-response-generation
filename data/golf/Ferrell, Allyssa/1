Q. How did it feel to finish like that?
ALLYSSA FERRELL: Yeah, I've been playing well the last couple weeks out on the Symetra Tour, so I was hoping to carry that out this week, and of course I love being in Wisconsin, so I was really hoping to play well this week.
Q. How did you get yourself straight after 2-over in the first four?
ALLYSSA FERRELL: You know, again, it's all a mental game, and I said to myself, okay, let's pick it up, like don't -- I just overanalyze everything, and I just have to remember it's a golf course, just hit it on the green and make a putt.  Especially after I was 2-over, I said, all right, the next one needs to just get one back, and we'll pick it up from there, and I knew I loved this course.  I had been putting well, so I knew I could get some birdies out there.
Q. Having the fanfare, your friends and family here, it could go both ways, it could bring a lot of pressure but it could be comfort and exciting; how was it for you to have that support?
ALLYSSA FERRELL: I just love it.  I have so many family members here today, especially my little cousins.  I have a seven-year old cousin out there, and I can hear her voice especially when I make a putt.  She gets so excited.  It doesn't make me nervous.  I was excited for everyone to be here, especially being at this kind of event, being at home, and being able to just kind of share with them what I do all the time.
