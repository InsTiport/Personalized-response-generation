Q. (No microphone).
JAYE MARIE GREEN: This morning, there wasn't as much wind as yesterday, and the fairways were kind of soft today.  So made it tougher, but the no wind helped for sure.
Q. What about the pin placement?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Oh, the pins are always tough in U.S. Opens, but especially today.  You just had to be on the correct side of them.  I didn't go for one pin today, so I think that helped my flow keep going, you know.  I didn't really put myself in positions where I was struggling to make par.
Q. Seems like we were talking to you in a similar position at (inaudible) last year, right?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah.
Q. What do you think you learned from that on the weekend?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: I would say just to keep staying patient and just the same game plan.  I think the more you put yourself in the position, you'll learn, and maybe hopefully I'm more comfortable with it now.
Q. Your group played well today.  Was that a give and take kind of thing with watching each other and feeling it because the other guys were playing well too?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Oh, yeah.  Having a great pairing really helps because I was struggling a little bit in the beginning yesterday, but to have Jess Korda 3 under and Az at 3 under, it really helped me keep going.  It definitely helps because they're just making birdies, hitting good shots, so it's nice to see it on such a tough golf course, seeing good shots all the time.
