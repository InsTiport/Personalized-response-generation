 Q.  You played some really good golf.  Top-10 in a major.  How does that feel to you?  
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Great.  I'm a little bummed with my finish, but still three back going into the weekend, which is a good -- if you would have told me at the beginning of the week that's what would happen, I would have been like, okay, cool, I'll take it.   
 Q.  What's the key for you?  
JAYE MARIE GREEN: My putting.  Any time I'm like inside 10 feet, so if -- which is huge I think in majors where you run one by or you're hit a deft chip and you get in there, yeah, I've been making almost like every 10-footer I've had.  Of course I missed a few, but it's crazy, I had a lot of saves today.  So that's why I can't be too mad.  Tripling the 17th hole, it's like a long hot day, almost six-hour round, I think it was like a brain fart, I don't even know what happened.  So therefore I'm not really mad I'm just like, all right, cool.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts heading into the weekend?  
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Honestly, like I would love to be leading it, but three back is a little more under the radar.  I like that.  I was a little nervous today, I've never really led in a major before.  So, yeah, take that experience and hopefully -- I want to win so bad, so but just got to keep my same mindset of not caring and just going with the flow.
