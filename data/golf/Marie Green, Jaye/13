Q. What was working so well for you today?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Well, I shot even par on my front nine.  I couldn't really get a lot going, and then kind of everything was going pretty well on the back.  I was hitting fairways, hit it close, and then when I did, I made the putt.  Shot 6-under on the back, which was cool.
Q. Have you had a stretch like that this year or recently that you can think of where you kind of just found your game that quickly like that?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Sometimes, but never -- like sometimes I'll find my game but never like that where I get -- I birdied, I think, eight of my last 10 holes, something crazy like that, eight of the last 12.  It's just everything was clicking, and then my brother is cool to caddie for me.  He helps keep me calm when I don't want to kill him.
Q. How important is that to keep your composure out there, like you said, especially when you didn't shoot the way you wanted to to start?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, I just knew the way I'm hitting and the way I'm putting, I could get some back.  I wasn't expecting six, but it was a reward, I guess, for patience.
Q. You're right up there; were you expecting this?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, I knew the scores were going to be low this week just because the amount of wedges I had in, but it doesn't take away that the course is hard, especially when it was blowing pretty good this morning.  I played well last week.  I hit it well, and I feel like I'm wanting a win so bad that as cool as that I'm putting myself in position, whether it happens or not, you only learn from getting in this position.
