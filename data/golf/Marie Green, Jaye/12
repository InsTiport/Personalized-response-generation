 Q.  You played in the ladies' Scottish Open last week.  The weather was a little bit different to what we've experienced today, but how helpful was that in your preparation for this week?  
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, just getting 25 mile-an-hour winds, right to left, left to right, into, just learning how to hit like hold shots, punch shots, high shots, I'm so glad I had that as a prep coming into this week so I didn't have to learn it this week, I got to learn it last week.   
 Q.  This is just your second appearance in the Ricoh Women's British Open.  How do you find it coming over here, playing this style of golf?  It must be so unfamiliar to what you're used to back home.  
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, it's definitely unfamiliar, but last week helped, and my brother, who caddies for me, he loves it.  He's like, this is so awesome, how the weather can be like that.  I'm like, you like this?  So it helps encourage me to embrace the conditions and not try to fight it.  We had a blast today.
