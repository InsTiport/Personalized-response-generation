Q. 7-under 64; tell me about your round.  What were some highs and lows?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: I played with Stacy Lewis today, so it was just good vibes.  We've played together before, and we play well together, so we were just kind of feeding off each other.  And then I started hitting it well.  I didn't have many bogeys today, and that was good.  All the birdies I made were short, pretty short putts, so I didn't really have to make too many outside of six feet, so that was nice.
I've been putting well all week, so then to hit it close, it just all kind of came together today.
Q. Do you feel like you have some momentum heading into the Scottish now playing so well on Sunday?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, for sure.  It definitely makes food taste better after, and the next tournament, it's just good knowing, wow, I shot a low round, like I'm capable of it, so it gives definitely confidence going into next week, which is something that's good to have in those types of conditions.
