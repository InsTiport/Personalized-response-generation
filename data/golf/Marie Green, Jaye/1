  Q. Shot even.  Stayed in the hunt.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Uh-huh.
 Q. What was the difference out there today?
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Well, I was playing great.  I just made a triple today.  Other than that, I mean, played great.
 Really proud of my last hole other than those two things.  What are you going to do?  Still got two days left, so I'm happy with how my game is.
 Looking forward to the weekend.
 Q. That's why you came out here, right, to finish putting, practice putting.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Yeah, exactly.  I putted really well today but could always get better.
 Q. Just the one bitter taste in the mouth at the end.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Yeah, exactly.
 Q. How do you anticipate the course?  It's going to rain tomorrow.  How do you anticipate you and everyone else going at the pins?
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Well, the greens are still brand new so still be firm even though it's going to rain.  I think it just really depends where they're going to put the pins.  They were a lot of the accessible pins and a lot of super tricky ones.  With the rain they might get a little bit more get-at-able.  But then that will make the course longer, so I think it should be maybe playing about the same score-wise.
 Q. Okay.  How was it just from a difference in the morning wave versus afternoon wave?
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Afternoon seemed like the greens got a little baked out so they were getting a little faster.  Not too different.  Since we were first off it was really like nothing different.  It just wasn't as cold as yesterday morning was.  It was really cold.  It was 50 degrees when we tee'd off versus 75.
 Q. A little different.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Yeah.
 Q. Your Florida blood can handle it thought.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Yeah.
 Q. Do you like this spot, being just a few back and having that lead within striking distance?
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   Yeah, I think since I just got of the course I'm still really mad that I missed a three-footer footer.  Once I like calm down and eat I'll being like, okay.  Once I come out tomorrow I won't be thinking about any of that.  I'm at where I'm; I still in a good position to put myself in better position going into Sunday.
 Q. Is there a confidence with you on this course right now?  Seems like you have a little underlying just knowledge or confidence with it.
 JAYE MARIE GREEN:   I'm really happy with how I'm ball striking.  I'm able to the work the ball both ways.  So it's really nice when pins are cut on the right.  I'm cutting them in there, and when there are on the left I'm drawing them.  It really makes any golf course feel -- not that it's easy because it's not at all actually -- but, yeah, I like this course really fits my eye.
