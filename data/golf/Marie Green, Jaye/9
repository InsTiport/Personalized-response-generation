Q. What happened to you yesterday coming in to make the cut on Friday?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, so I made a pretty good 2-putt on 17, and I get to 18 knowing that I had to birdie it to make the cut.  Me and my brother were discussing clubs; it starts down pouring, windy and I hit like a little 8-iron from 115.  That's how windy it was.  Went right in the hole and we just threw our clubs in the bag and went wild.  Ended up making the cut.
Q. And YOU played the front nine in 5-under par, with a little bit of a tricky stretch dropping three in two holes on the back nine.  But how pleased are you to get in with that score today?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: Yeah, if you would have told me on the back nine yesterday, hey, you're going to be at 8-under after the third round, I would have taken it.
Yeah, that little stretch of holes I didn't play good, but I just kept a positive attitude, which I usually do and just tried to make some birdies coming in.  Pretty happy.
Q. You're likely in a good position coming into Sunday into major championship.  How do you prepare for that between now and then?
JAYE MARIE GREEN: I'm just going to do what I've done all week.  Honestly I didn't know I was in this tournament until like a few days before.  So I haven't really treated it like a major.  I've just treated it like, you know, just another normal round of golf.
So I'm just going to do what I feel is right, and that's pretty much it.  Not take it too seriously.
