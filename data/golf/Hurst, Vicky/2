 Q.  Great day.  What was working well for you out there on the course?  
VICKY HURST: I think the biggest think I just tried to stay patient.  Yeah, I was hitting really good tee shots, hitting it close and making putts.   
Everything went pretty well.  Yeah, stayed pretty steady out there.   
 Q.  For at least today you beat the heat getting out early.  I imagine some perfect greens to start with.  
VICKY HURST: Yeah, we did.  It was good.  The greens were nice.  Conditions this week are awesome.  I think the best I've seen so far on this course.   
Yeah, beat the heat.  I think it's supposed to warm up.  I don't know what it looks like tomorrow.  Maybe pretty warm tomorrow.   
 Q.  When you see that 27-under won this last year and there is always a lot of low scores, do you have to get into a mindset and be more aggressive?  Just play your game?  
VICKY HURST: I didn't really do that.  Going into today I just tried to stay steady and stick with my routine and trust my swing.  I have been working on some stuff in my game, and it came together nicely today.   
That's kind of the plan tomorrow:  sticking with my game plan.   
 Q.  What are some of the things you've been working on?  
VICKY HURST: Few swing changes.  You know, I struggled a little bit last year, but my swing has come together nicely.   
I feel pretty good going into the rest of the week.
