 Q.   You had a good round, minus one.   Could it have been better or did you get what you got out of it?  
VICKY HURST:   I played pretty consistent today.   My goal was to stay around even par and not get too crazy with the big numbers or anything like that.   I played very steady.   Only one bogey, two birdies.   Very happy with my round.  
   
 Q.   Ball striking key or putting?  
VICKY HURST:   Ball striking today.   The pins weren't that bad, so I think tomorrow will be more the putting.   I hit it well.   I hit my tee shots good, kept it in the fairway, which is key.   And one of the few shots I didn't hit the green was where I made the bogey, so it comes down to hitting greens and keeping it in the fairway.  
   
 Q.   As it turns out, the way things are going, you're two strokes off the lead at the end of the day today.   So that's probably something you're pretty happy about?  
VICKY HURST:   Yeah.   Very happy.   It's only Thursday, so my goal is to stay steady, play like I did today, consistent, not getting too ahead of myself and stay patient, and focused and aggressive.  
   
 Q.   Did the heat bother you at all?  
VICKY HURST:   It wasn't bad.   I drank plenty of water.   Couple Gatorades.   I can't tell you how many bottles of watery had today.   Yeah, I felt pretty good out there.  
   
 Q.   Like the golf course?  
VICKY HURST:   I love the course.   The course is awesome.
