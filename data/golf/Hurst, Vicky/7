 Q. Can you just tell me about the day? 
 VICKY HURST: Long day. Brittany and I we started out good, like ham and egging it kind of for the first couple of holes. Made a couple of good putts, hit some great shots, both of us. 
 But I mean, they were just - Caroline and Sophie - they were a great team. I don't know how many birdies they made. They made some awesome clutch putts. But that's the way it goes, I guess.

 Q. So it's your first match at Solheim?
 VICKY HURST: Yeah, it was awesome. The first tee was awesome. It was a great experience. I got off the tee on the fairway, so I was happy about that, so it was very exciting. It was a great moment, I think. So, yeah.
