 Q. Can you talk about the difference between Thailand and this week, what maybe you worked on? 
 VICKY HURST: With my game? I think the first week, like last week, I was just kind of -- went from three months off to all of a sudden it's a tournament. So it was just kind of getting adjusted to all of work that I put into my game over the off-season to making it work in the first week out. 
 So I was kind of anxious, or nervous. But I learned a lot just from that one week kind of getting back into the groove, so I just focused on playing my game this week. 

 Q. And that's the best round you've played here at the garden course, am I right?
 VICKY HURST: Yeah. 

 Q. You must be delighted, because last year was tough for you, so talk about the difference between how you played last year and what you did today?
 VICKY HURST: Well, last year I think it was also the first tournament for me that year. So I was kind of rusty last year. 

 Q. And today, do you feel like everything started to fall into place? What worked today?
 VICKY HURST: Today, like starting out, it was all right. I was hitting it close but nothing was falling and then toward the end of the round I was kind of getting into the routine and putts were falling.
