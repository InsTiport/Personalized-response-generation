 Q. A little bit of a roller coaster today. Eagle, double, birdie. 
 VICKY HURST: Yeah.

 Q. Talk about the round. I mean, bottom line is 9-under. That's a pretty good spot to be. 
 VICKY HURST: Yeah, I'm very happy with the way I played. I'm hitting the ball great off the tee. My driver is really, you know, doing pretty good for me. I've been sticking everything, all the pins. 
 If I just made half the putts their gave myself... (laughter.) But I'm happy.

 Q. Mentally does it do anything to make the eagle and then a double? What does that do to you mentally?
 VICKY HURST: Yeah, well, the double is kind of a bummer because it's only two holes left. But that par-5 is kind of tricky if you don't, you know, pay attention. 
 I was trying to save par, at least bogey, but I hit my drive into the bad stuff and then hacked it out of there and left myself like a 180-yard shot. I decided to go for it and left it in the bunker. 
 So it was kind of tough, but I'll take it.

 Q. The eagle, tell me about that. 
 VICKY HURST: It was on No...

 Q. ...14. 
 VICKY HURST: Yeah, 14. I kept giving myself like 100-yard shots, so I had like 96 there. Been hitting them all day; just nailed it that time. I landed it like five yards past it and then it rolled back into the hole.

 Q. What club?
 VICKY HURST: 54-degree. 

 Q. Cool. Thanks. 
 VICKY HURST: Thanks. 

 Q. Good luck?
 VICKY HURST: Thank you.
