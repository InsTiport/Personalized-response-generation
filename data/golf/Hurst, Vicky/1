 Q.  Was that just a microcosm of your round?  
VICKY HURST: Yeah, I kind of had a lucky break.  I hit not a great tee shot and I was in like a burrowing hole or something.  I had a tree in front of me and got a free drop and was able to be clear of the tree.   
Then I hit kind of a good shot out of the desert and it worked out.  I made birdie.   
 Q.  Is that what you almost need?  When you have a round like this going, that's what happens, it's just like almost everything goes your way or...  
VICKY HURST: Yeah, I mean, a lot of it is just staying patient.  I didn't hit some --  some shots weren't great today.  I was able to kind of forget about it and just keep going and score.   
Yeah, today's round and yesterday's round were a little bit different.  Yesterday I hit it really well off the tee and everything was kind of clicking, and today everything was a little bit different.   
 Q.  Scrambly?  
VICKY HURST: A little bit different.
