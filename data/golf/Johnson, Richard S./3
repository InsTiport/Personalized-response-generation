  Q. Solid 5-under par start this week. What do you attribute your game to?   
 RICHARD JOHNSON: Well, I've actually been playing pretty good at home. I just haven't got it out on the course for a while, so it's been a frustrating year for me. So it's just nice to finally get a good score and start a tournament off well.  
  
  Q. I won $5 from Michael Collins. He said you were not a great skateboarder. You were a pretty good skateboarder before you got into golf, just too many broken bones to keep playing golf, huh?  
 RICHARD JOHNSON: Well, if the word great and skateboarding is connected in the same sentence, I wouldn't -- I was decent. I was like a 4-handicapper maybe.  
  
  Q. Tell me how you got around the golf course today. It was a little bit softer and you took advantage of that?  
 RICHARD JOHNSON: Yeah, I drove it really well. I hit every fairway today, which helps a lot on this golf course, because it is pretty narrow in certain spots. You know, it was really my driving, and I put myself in a position to have a lot of short irons in, and I stuffed quite a few in there. I made seven birdies, so that was nice.   
  
  Q. What are the greens like speed-wise?   
 RICHARD JOHNSON: 10 and a half, 11 maybe. It's Bermuda, so it's down-grain. Down-grain it gets quick, but uphill you've got to give them a little bit of a thump. They're great Bermuda greens. I've kind of been missing the Bermuda because I've been home so much in Florida of late, so I've been playing a lot on that surface.
