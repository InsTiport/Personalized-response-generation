 Q. We need a Super Bowl prediction from you.   
JOE THEISMANN: I like the Arizona Cardinals and the New England Patriots. I think the Arizona Cardinals are the most complete football team left in the playoffs. They play great defense. They can bring pressure up front. They have dynamic offense with speed outside, and Carson Palmer just had the year of a lifetime.   
I felt that the Arizona Cardinals would have been in the Super Bowl last year had Carson stayed healthy, and so they're making the run this year.   
   
 Q. And the Redskins had a pretty good year, made the playoffs.   
JOE THEISMANN: Very optimistic.  
   
 Q. What do they need?   
JOE THEISMANN: They need some seasoning. We lost a lot of corners through the course of the year, but our young quarterback grew. We had new coaches, new front office. 18 guys were on IR, eight of them starters. Lost three tight ends, an offensive line that started five guys, four of which had very little NFL experience.   
There's a lot of very good, positive things that you can look at with the Washington Redskins.
