  Q. First USGA experience.  What did you expect coming in?
 A LIM KIM:   Because first experience it's more about learning and observing, experiencing the whole tournament.
 Q. And how would you say you're doing towards your goals?
 A LIM KIM:   The course itself is very much my type.  If I was in better condition I think I would be having a higher performance.
 But I'm in love with the course.  Very great playing conditions and so forth.
