  Q. 3-under 68; talk us through what was working well today.
 A LIM KIM:   I tried my best.  Not bad, not good.
 Q. What was working well today?
 A LIM KIM:   The start went well.  I was able to get a good pace on it and get the balls closer to the green so finish well.
 Q. Knowing you have to play a different golf course tomorrow, what was your experience with Jackrabbit during the practice rounds?
 A LIM KIM:   Because it is a completely different course, I'm just going to treat it the way it is, a fresh start, new ideas.
