 Q.  Okay.  That's not the ideal finish but seven birdies nonetheless.  Overall a good day.  Just a few comments on the latter part of the day?  
WES ROACH: I played well.  Hit the ball great.  Obviously not what the finish that I was looking for.  But that doesn't take away from the positives of the day.  Hit the ball well, gave myself a lot of good chances.  Made, like you said, seven birdies.  So anytime you can get around here and make six or seven birdies, maybe throw an eagle here and there it's going to be good.   
 Q.  I know you guys had quite a wait back on the 18th tee.  Does that tend to get in your head a little bit or do you block it out?  
WES ROACH: A little bit.  I mean, you definitely like to keep the rhythm going when you're playing well, but that's part of it.  You kind of get used to stopping and going out there.  I just unfortunately didn't hit a great tee shot, and then three-putted there, but still in a good position tomorrow make a run.   
 Q.  Finally, coming into the week playing well.  You've had top-20 finishes in, I think, two of your last three starts.  What's going right for you?  
WES ROACH: I've just been hitting the ball a lot better, hitting -- my iron play has been better.  Gave myself plenty of chances.  Just gotta keep working on the putter and try to make a few birdies.
