Q. So you have to finish up your 1st Round this morning and go right to the tee for the 2nd Round.
Seems like you handled it pretty well.
WES ROACH: It was kind of nice.  I made a few birdies to kind of finish up my 1st Round there this morning and kind of kept it going.  Played pretty solid all day.  Hit a lot of good iron shots which I haven't been doing so much this year.  That was nice.
Q. It's been a little bit of a frustrating season for you, 189 in the FedExCup standings.  What's turned it around this week and how big is this weekend for you?
WES ROACH: Ball-striking really, the iron play was the big difference the first two rounds.  Yeah, this weekend is definitely important but, you know, I'm going to enjoy the experience and just do the best I can.
Q. That's a great attitude.  Hope you play well.
WES ROACH: Thank you.
