Q.   Wes, great round out there.   Just tell me about it. 
WES ROACH:   Thank you.   Yeah, got started off a little slow, made a bogey on my second hole of the day, No. 11, and quickly got it back with a birdie on 12. 
Couple other birdies there on the Back 9 on the parâ€‘5s, 15 and 18.   And then got on a good little run there on the front nine, birdied 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, I guess, whatever four in a row was.   I got on a nice stretch there, and just played pretty solid all day.

Q.   And the golf course, how's it treating you?
WES ROACH:   It's good.   The rain definitely softened things up a little bit.   We were able to kind of get at some more pins today.   But I assume it'll firm back up in the afternoon as the wind continues to blow.

Q.   Tell me a little bit about how you feel your game is doing this season. 
WES ROACH:   It's coming around.   Got off to a slow start the start of the year but here in the last month or so I've been playing a lot better.   And still working really hard, and yeah, starting to come along.

Q.   How do you like Puerto Rico so far?
WES ROACH:   It's been good.   Everybody is on island time, just chilling.
