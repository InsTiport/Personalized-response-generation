Q.   Some comments on the round.   Great eagle on the 13th hole, then sort of a topsy‑turvy back nine. 
WES ROACH:   Yeah, that eagle was nice.   I hit it to about a foot and a half or so, so that was a good start to the day, those five points early. 
Pretty steady for the rest of that nine.   Birdie on 18.   A little bit up and down on the inward nine, three birdies and three bogeys. 
I'm hitting the ball well, putting well.   Just looking forward to the weekend. 

Q.   Three bogeys in a normal round usually hurts you, but in this round if you're making eagles and birdies, you're in good shape still. 
WES ROACH:   The two‑for‑one, five points for the eagle is big.   You could shake off the bogeys a little bit better than you could in a normal week.   But that's kind of what makes it fun to play this week. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about your season, just a couple weeks left, your thoughts on your year as a whole and your goals coming down the stretch. 
WES ROACH:   Yeah, it's been a big learning experience.   I've had my share of ups and downs. 
Moving forward, I really feel like I don't have anything to lose.   Just kind of go play, take it all in stride.   Take it the best I can, see where that leaves us. 
Yeah, just kind of looking forward to this weekend and next week as well. 

Q.   You're solo second, just four back.   Just stay aggressive, right?
WES ROACH:   Yeah, just keep making birdies, try to make eagles when you can.   Just have fun, man.   That's the bottom line.
