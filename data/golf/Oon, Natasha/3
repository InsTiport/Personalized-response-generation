 Q.  Natasha, what do you think about your day?  
NATASHA OON: I had a really good game today.  It's just that I blew one hole.  It made my score a little bit higher, but I'm pretty happy with how I maintained my score today.   
 Q.  When you didn't do so well, did it affect the rest of your game?  
NATASHA OON: It affected the score only, really.  But basically, I was okay throughout those last few holes.  I don't think it affected me because I was just -- the last couple holes, it was me just targeting for a birdie and it wasn't so bad, yeah.
