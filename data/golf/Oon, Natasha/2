Q. So how was your round today?
NATASHA OON: Actually it was okay before the rain delay.  But after rain delay, I was struggling to find my rhythm at first but then I found it.  So it was okay but not so good.
Q. So what did you have trouble with today?
NATASHA OON: Getting the putting speed right and after the rain, you know, because it makes the green much more softer.  So yeah, it was really hard to just really get the speed.  Also, you know, after the long delay, your body is not really warmed up, so yeah, that was what I had trouble.
Q. What were you doing during the rain delay?
NATASHA OON: The rain delay, I was just sitting down and just trying to like talk and hang out.  And then 15 minutes before I was warming up, we were stretching.
Q. Overall how do you think you've improved compared to last year at this stage?
NATASHA OON: I think I improved a lot, considering my score between last year and this year.  I hope I can do better because I expect more.  But you know, I'll try tomorrow.
Q. Yesterday you said the putting was hot and that was the one that was saving you.  Playing on the wet fairways, was there anything different?
NATASHA OON: It wasn't plugging.  We had preferred lies.  So it was okay.  And you know, I could still hit the ball, so yeah, it wasn't that bad.
Q. Any goals set for the weekend?
NATASHA OON: I hope that I can play under in the next few days, and hopefully, you know, try and get my rhythm back.
Q. Finish under overall?
NATASHA OON: Under overall, yes.
