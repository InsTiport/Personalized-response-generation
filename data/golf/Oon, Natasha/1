 Q.  How would you describe your week?  
NATASHA OON: My week, very tough.  I didn't reach my goal but I learned a lot from it, yeah.   
 Q.  What was your goal?  
NATASHA OON: My goal is to play under, overall.  But I was way ahead of that.  In the end, you know, it's just a game.   
 Q.  I know you ended with three birdies.  Just tell us about that.  
NATASHA OON: Today I started out really weirdly.  I was duffing my shots.  I didn't really know what was happening.  And then suddenly I was hitting my shots really good, and you know, I was having pars, pars, pars, doing a lot of pacing myself, pacing myself and getting more concentrated.   
Those three birdies came really unexpectedly and I was really happy to finish better than how I started.   
 Q.  What did you learn from the week about yourself and your game?  What can you take out of it?  
NATASHA OON: You know, sometimes I just tried too hard that I forgot to enjoy the game.  So that's what I learned this week.  Also, if you didn't reach your goal, that doesn't mean that you didn't achieve anything.  You achieved something, which you learn from it, yeah.   
 Q.  What do you think you need to work on moving forward from here?  
NATASHA OON: Probably just learning to trust myself.   
 Q.  Was that an issue, do you think, compared to the first two days and the last two?  
NATASHA OON: I was just really dependent on my caddie.  You know, sometimes I just wasn't confident when he gave me the stuff.  But it's not like I'm not believing him.  People have different perspectives on yardages and everything.  If I wasn't confident in it, I wouldn't be hitting the shot to my maximum potential.   
But you know, he did a good job; I did a good job.  Sometimes I have to work on that.
