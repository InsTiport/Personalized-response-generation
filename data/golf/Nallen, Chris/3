   CHRIS NALLEN:  The course is playing good, but a lot different than it did at the NCAA in 2002.  The greens are great.  The bunkers are great.  I was in a lot of them today. 
 Obviously to host national championship here speaks volumes for this course.  When we made the turn, the wind really started picking up, but I actually played better on the back 9.  It was swirling out there, so you just had to trust your yardage and back off when you needed to. 
 It's been an up and down year for me.  I've been inconsistent.  I've been working really hard lately on my short game.  I've been losing shots because I have no confidence with the putter, and that is where it is at. 
 I'm hitting it good, but losing shots on the greens.  I've been working on a couple of things, trying to get confidence with my setup and make a consistent stroke with it. 
 It will take a lot of patience this week.  It is going to get firm and fast.  You've got hit it in the right spots and stick to your game plan.  Don't try stuff you don't think you can do.  If I can get on a roll and in a rhythm, then I will be okay this year. 
 I've been searching for things.  I've been putting Bands-Aids on things instead of finding something and sticking to it.  I've got to trust what I'm doing instead of searching for things new each day. 
 There is a lot of golf left this year.  Hopefully thing will fall into place for me.  I've just got to trust my game and not overthink things.
