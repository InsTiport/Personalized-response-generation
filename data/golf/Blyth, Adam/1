  Q. Still playing nicely?  
 ADAM BLYTH: I am. It is a good start to the week. I played really well yesterday for a 68 and left a couple out there. Today I am very happy, I just played solid. I guess I got a lot of confidence from last week (where he led into the third round at the Maybank Malaysian Open and finished 10th). I could have taken it any way I wanted but I took it the positive way. It was a great week. At the start of the week there, I would have taken 10th. It was a great result and I've got the confidence into this week.  
  
  Q. How did you deal with the disappointment?  
 ADAM BLYTH: I looked back and reflected on the week and it was a very good week. You just get over it. I looked at the good things that happened and the bad things. I didn't get angry at myself.  
  
  Q. What's been working so far?  
 ADAM BLYTH: I've kept it quite simple. I drove it well and knocked in some nice putts. Keeping it in play has been the main thing. When I'm ready to win, it will just happen. I probably pushed it too hard during the final round. I was patient enough but I was trying really hard. This week, I'm just going to finish the four rounds off and whatever I finish will be my best.  
  
  Q. A different course this week obviously but how different is it from Malaysia?  
 ADAM BLYTH: It's a completely different course. You just adapt. I love this course The course is beautiful, the weather is beautiful and it's just a nice feeling to be here.  
  
  Q. Did you receive a lot of phone calls after Sunday?  
 ADAM BLYTH: I did, from friends and coaches. They congratulated me on a good week. I didn't play bad on the last day, it wasn't a blow out. I just didn't get it happening. That was the only thing.
