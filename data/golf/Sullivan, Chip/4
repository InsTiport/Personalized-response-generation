Q.  Tell me a little bit about your round today.
CHIP SULLIVAN:  Well, before I teed off, I was telling some friends this is the kind of golf course you could hit the ball well and still shoot 80, and that's about what happened to me today.  I hit the ball very well.  It was just one of the worst scoring experiences of my life.  I missed a few shots which penalized me very dearly.  I mean, I hit it in the rough and short sided myself a couple times around the green and walked away with a double bogey.  Hit it in the water on one par 3 and made double.

But I hit a lot of good shots in there about six feet, and could have shot 4 under easily on the front, which was my    my front nine, which was the back nine, and ended up shooting even par.  You know, I missed four putts inside six feet, then I made the turn and missed a couple of fairways, a couple greens, and next thing I know, I'm struggling for bogeys and double bogeys and shooting a horrible 43.

I'm walking away thinking I hit the ball pretty darn good, I just need to work my way around the golf course a little bit better and not miss it in the wrong spots I guess is the best way of putting it.
Q.  What do you need to work on for tomorrow?
CHIP SULLIVAN:  You know, when I finished 31st at Whistling Straits I putted extremely well.  I finished 4th in putting that week.  I know if I look at my stats this week, the putting has got to be one of the worst in the field.  If anything, I think I've just got to get a feel with my putter.  I feel like I'm hitting the ball well.  I hit a lot of fairways and hit just a lot of solid iron shots in.  So I think it's all going to come down to putting.  I'm just going to go out there and not be too aggressive and try and make some ten footers and not be too aggressive and try and enjoy the day.
