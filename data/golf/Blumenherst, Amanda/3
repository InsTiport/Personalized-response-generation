 Q. Having the delay, was it sort of frustrating to kind of sit around all day and watch Jiyai Shin make birdies or were you watching? 
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST: I was not watching at all. I had no idea what was going on. I mean, it was tough sitting in the room for hours on end. But, you know, it's just part of the game. 
 It happened at Q-school a few years ago, and I just had to deal with it. I got to rest, watch some O.C. re-runs and workout. 
 But, you know, it's just a part of it. It's going to be tough tomorrow getting up early, but I prefer that than playing in the dark.

 Q. You kind of said yesterday that you liked being on the sunny side of things this week?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST: Yeah.

 Q. This sort of didn't turn out necessarily that way. 
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST: It kind of jinxed me. I know. I really felt we had the better pairing, but I would have much rather played 18 today. 
 I mean everything evens out. And maybe I'll get on the good side of the tee times. But we didn't have to deal with waking up early and then waiting, which that would have been really tough.
