Q.   Amanda, this is a great way to start out your very first Women's Open Championship.  A lot of players seem to be intimidated the first time they play in this, but you weren't apparently, were you?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  I definitely had the first tee butterflies on the first tee.  After that I calmed down and was able to play.  I had a great drive and it was a par 5, so I stuck my shot pretty close and made the putt.
Q.  This is your first U.S. Women's Open.  How did you prepare for it?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  I just had tournaments coming in.  I was kind of on a roll.  I played on a sponsors exemption at Wegmans and played well there, and just kept playing.
Q.  How did the course play well for you today, after the rain and bad weather we've had?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  It played really long.  The ball doesn't really roll.  I was able to get it down there and have long irons into the hole.
Q.  You hit 14 greens.
AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  Yes.
Q.  Were you hitting long irons?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  I was hitting the 5 iron and 4 iron, and the ones I did miss, I was on the fringe, so I was putting.  I only chipped once today.
Q.  If you had to put a couple of sentences on today, what would you say?
 AMANDA BLUMENHERST:  It was an amazing experience; I had my family here, and I saw them on the sidelines and clapping.  It was a great all around experience.
