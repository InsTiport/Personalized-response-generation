 Q.   Tough conditions out there today with the wind and everything, but how much tougher was the course playing today than yesterday?  
    AMANDA BLUMENHERST:   The wind is crazy.   It even made putting difficult.   Definitely changed some targets for sure out there and made several holes much shorter and several holes much longer.   
    So, it was; it was a challenging day, and just had to really stay patient.   
   
 Q.   I know not the finish that you would have wanted but how pleased overall that you were able to keep yourself still in the hunt and manage with such tough conditions today?  
    AMANDA BLUMENHERST:   Really, what's frustrating about the last hole, is I hit every shot perfect.   That's just the nature of the game.   Sometimes good bounces and bad bounces.   
    But I really did, stayed very patient out there, and just tried to play solid golf.
