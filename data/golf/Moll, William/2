Q. What was it like first experience in match play at the Junior Amateur?
WILLIAM MOLL: It was really awesome.  It was like a whole new experience playing match play, singles match play.  Never really played a singles match play tournament.  Definitely not on this big of a scale.
It was really awesome.
Q. What was different about it than a normal tournament that you would play in?
WILLIAM MOLL: Yeah, so normal tournament you just have to beat the entire field.  That's what you want to do.  Match play you only have to beat one guy.  You can adjust your play off how they play and everything like that.
Completely different game.
Q. And then today you jumped on him pretty quickly; won four of the first six holes.
WILLIAM MOLL: Uh-huh.
Q. Mainly with pars.  What were you doing well?
WILLIAM MOLL: Yeah, I was hitting it solid.  I missed one fairway on the front, so I was hitting it really good.  Didn't get many putts to fall, but I was winning holes with par so it was good.
Q. You were 3-up when you turned and then you birdied 10 and 11.  Tell me how you birdies those two holes.
WILLIAM MOLL: I hit a good shot into 10 and then my first putt of the day, and then 11 they moved the tees up so I had a 3-iron at the green off the tee.  I got up and down from the bunker for a birdie.
Q. How long was the putt on 11?
WILLIAM MOLL: Four feet.
Q. And on 10 what did you hit into the green there?
WILLIAM MOLL: I hit a 54-degree.
Q. How long was the putt on 10?
WILLIAM MOLL: Eight feet.
Q. Yeah.  So now that you've played stroke play and match play, where is your confidence level on this course right now?
WILLIAM MOLL: I'm feeling pretty good right now.  I think I was 2-Under today with three holes left, so I'm playing just like I was in stroke play.  That got me on top of the leaderboard, so if I can keep it rolling like I did today in stroke play I should be good.
Q. When you got up what was your mental state?  Were you feeling comfortable or saying, man, I got to keep the hammer down on this?
WILLIAM MOLL: I was kind of comfortable, but I know in match play anything can happen, so you really just have to stay focused and keep grinding.
Q. Now it gets a little tougher.
WILLIAM MOLL: Uh-huh.
Q. Potentially playing two matches every day.
WILLIAM MOLL: Yeah.
Q. How do you get prepared for that?
WILLIAM MOLL: Just got to get a lot of rest and stay mentally focused.
