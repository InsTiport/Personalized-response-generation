 Q.  Not the outcome you were looking for, but still first U.S. Junior Am; very impressive being a co-medalist.  What's the whole experience been like for you?  
WILLIAM MOLL: It's been really cool.  The tournament has been awesome.  You know, match play is fun, but I guess I just didn't have it today.  Overall the tournament was pretty cool.   
 Q.  You had a lead on the front and then kind of struggled on the back.  Can you talk me through maybe what wasn't working.  
WILLIAM MOLL: Everything was off.  I think I was like 6-over over something, but I just couldn't hit the ball, wasn't in the fairway a lot, and didn't make any putts, so...   
 Q.  What have you learned from this experience and maybe can take forward into next year's or more match play events to come?  
WILLIAM MOLL: You just need to really focus on every shot in match play.  You just got to beat the other person you're playing.  I probably could have putted a little better, better lag putts.   
 Q.  Did you feel any added pressure being the co-medalist?  
WILLIAM MOLL: Not really.
