 Q.  Things really got tight on the front nine.  What were you telling yourself when you saw other names getting near you even though you had the lead?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I didn't really look at the leaderboard in the beginning.  I knew it would take a pretty good round today to be up there.   
Saw the leaderboard on 15, but I just tried to keep my head down and do my thing.  Felt like I played pretty solid on the front and made two good putts on 13 and 17.   
A little interesting at the end, but I'm so happy and proud of myself this week.   
 Q.  Seventh win on the LPGA Tour.  (Regarding U.S.  Women's Open.)  Playing here in the hometown of your alma mater and first win since...  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, of all the wins probably one the ones that's going to be more special.  Like if it wouldn't be for me getting an opportunity to come to Arizona State University about ten years ago, I wouldn't be here today.  This truly still feels like home, even though I'm based in Florida.   
I have so many friends and family here.  They feel like family, my U.S. family.  You know, couldn't think of a better place to be.  I'm just so happy to be back.  I wasn't even going to play a couple weeks and just ended up adding it last minute.  Maybe it was meant to be.  End.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Thank you.  Go Devils.
