Q. When he told you about the grain of sand, what were you thinking?  You took it so well, what were you thinking?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, first, I couldn't really believe that it happened.  It wasn't my intention to ground the club.  It's blowing 35, 40 out there, and I had a 5-iron off a downhill lie in the bunker.  It's been a long day, a long week.  So probably misjudged it a little bit and touched a little bit of sand and that is a penalty.
I just wish they would have told me a little earlier.  They told me after I hit my third shot.  It might not have changed anything, but I just wish it was a little bit earlier.
But, hey, I'm finishing second in the U.S. Open, and I played great today and played really good all week.  So I'm proud of myself.
Q. There's been a little bit of controversy about when both of you were told.  You were told after your third shot.  She was told before her third.  What was your reaction on that?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I was a little disappointed that they told me after.  I might have played a little more aggressive that shot, knowing that I was two behind.  I had a great shot in there, but maybe not as aggressive as I should have.  But, hey, I made a mistake, and I will have to take the consequences for it.
Q. How do you feel about her winning this way and you losing this way?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I still finished second.  I played great all week, and that's all I can control.  I wish -- I played great those three holes, I had a really good 5-iron out, even though it was grounded.
Brittany has been playing good all week, and she ended up winning, so congratulations to her.
Q. Would you have rather they told Brittany after she hit her third shot?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I wish they would have told us after 17, when it actually happened, not like so far down 18, because they obviously must have seen it earlier.
Q. Everything seemed to be going well?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I was hitting my irons beautiful all day.  Hit tons of fairways.  Made a couple of good putts coming in, bogey-free.  And that's all you can ask for on a Sunday of a U.S. Open.
Q. Take solace as the runner-up or disappointed?
ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I'm proud of myself this week, and I played great all week.
