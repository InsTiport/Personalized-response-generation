   MATT PAULSON: How do feel after today's round?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I think I'm hitting it a little bit better today than I've done the past two days. I have my swing coach here all this week, so I've spent quite a lot of time-out on the range.
 So I started hitting better and started hitting the fairways, which always is going to help on this course, and obviously I've been feeling comfortable with my putting all day and all week. 

 Q. Did you make any adjustments on the range between Friday and today? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, we've just been working a lot on the swing this week. It's been kind of on and off a little bit but started going in the right direction, so I'm very happy. 

 Q. How do you feel you did on par 3s? You had a couple of birdies today.
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I think I did pretty good, missed a short putt on 11, made a bogey and a par 3, but overall I'm happy with the round. 

 Q. You catapulted yourself back into the mix. Do you feel you're in good position? Are you happy with where you're heading? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Absolutely. You start out the day in a little bit of a position further down. Obviously I had a good day, and you never know how everyone else is going to do but I'm happy with the way I did today, and obviously I'm in a good position for tomorrow. 

 Q. Obviously 72, 73 isn't bad, but were you happy with how you were over the first couple of days? Were you frustrated? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: The first day was good. Yesterday I felt like I struggled a little bit, but saved me with my short game, so I'm working in the right direction, so I'm happy. 

 Q. Did you think you had that putt here on 18 for birdie? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I think it slipped away a little bit right from the beginning; I thought I had the one on 17, though. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
