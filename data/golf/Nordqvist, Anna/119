   THE MODERATOR: You finished. Take me through it. 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I'm happy, I had a great week. I rolled a lot of good putts today; none of them would really drop on the front nine, got it going on the back nine. I hit a bad tee shoot on the 17 and made bogey there, got caught in the rough, but hit a good putt to go in for par on the last hole. Overall I'm happy, and things are starting to fall into place. I'm happy. 
 THE MODERATOR: When you see Catriona get off to a start like she did on the front nine, what are the thoughts out on the course? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I played with her yesterday, and she played great. When she gets on a run it's hard to stop. 
 I hit as many birdies as I could, and I thought I did a lot of good things but my putts didn't really drop. Overall just really happy. 
 THE MODERATOR: Great finish in Taiwan and a great performance here. How do you feel about your game right now? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Things are starting to click, so it's right where I want to be. I got two more tournaments so hopefully I can keep the good work up and be ready for next year. 

 Q. Catriona never falls. That's her, huh? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, she is a great player, and she played the best this week so she deserved to win. 

 Q. Is this your best tournament here? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I'm really happy.
