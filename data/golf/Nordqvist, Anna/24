 Q.  2-up win.  You made a blazing start.  Four birdies in the first five holes then it got quite tight after that.  Talk about the day, Anna.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, it was quite up-and-down.  We got off to a great start, I struggled on quite a few holes on the back and Caroline played great on those.  So we kind of were a little bit up-and-down, but made a great par on 17 and then won on 18, which I think we both were very happy with.   
 Q.  What was the key to that start?  Any particular hole really got you going?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I think we made birdie on the first hole and I think that was quite important.  And then made a birdie on 3, 4 and 5.  So just made some key putts and got a little bit of momentum there.   
 Q.  Obviously, Caroline, you were up against strong opponents and they got you back to all square briefly.  What were your thoughts at that point?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well to be honest, I think we were just struggling a bit at that time and I felt like we can't keep struggling like this, it's got to turn at some point.  Then Anna got that birdie on 14 and that was key.  And after that at least we made pars in.   
 Q.  What was the birdie on 14?  Did you drive it?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I hit it to, I don't know, about 20 feet maybe.  So I felt like it was a great birdie there because they had just won two holes in a row there.  Caroline, she went for it in two and she got a little bit unlucky with the lie there and she made a great par on 16.  So that kept it going.   
 Q.  Obviously, Caroline, it's important to get a win day one just for that strong early momentum.  What does it mean to you now going into day two?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I think it was just like I said before, it's just nice to get the job done today and obviously putting points on the board for Sweden.  And I'm just really thrilled to play tomorrow and hopefully we can give Japan a good match.   
 Q.  Can we expect the same combination tomorrow or is it a secret for the moment?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well --   
ANNA NORDQVIST: I think you can probably expect --   
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah the same.   
(Laughter.)   
 Q.  Final question.  How does this course set up as a match play challenge, do you think?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, for me personally I don't think it's a great golf course for me.  I'm not quite a bomber and I feel like it's a little bit of a bomber's paradise out there.  It's quite interesting.  I mean it's a great golf course, but with a little bit of the conditions, there's a lot of mud balls out there, there's a lots of sketchy lies and, yes, there was a divot on the last shot there and there was a divot on the first hole.  And you just never know, you can be in the fairway and be in a tough spot, so you just never know.  But it has a lot of character and a lot of tougher greens with a lot of runoffs.  So they tucked quite a few pins today, so it definitely challenged all of us.
