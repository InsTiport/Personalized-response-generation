 Q.  Was the putt about five feet, straight?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Left-to-right.   
 Q.  At what point did you think you had a chance to win this championship you? Started the day five shots back.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, I missed a short putt on 5 today to go 2-over, 2-over for the round after five holes.  Really didn't hit that many bad shots but scores didn't really tell the truth.   
But hit a great 6-iron in on 6.   
I made birdie there and then I spun a wedge for eagle on my seventh hole.   
But then 14, I hit a great hybrid and birdied there, and then great 3-wood in on 15 to birdie.   
18 was playing really tough today.  So making a bogey there in regulation felt great.   
And just the weather in the playoff, it seemed very cold.  I'm from Sweden but I'm freezing.   
 Q.  Quick question about the glandular fever you were suffering from, the mono you were suffering from, a month and a half, and you were on bed rest for 2 1/2 weeks and now you're a Major Champion.  How do you figure that out?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I don't know, these last couple weeks, it's been hard; it's been frustrating; it's been disappointing.  I was very excited to tee it up in Solheim Cup and was absolutely exhausted after.   
Came back last week, hit it flawless, missed the cut.   
So it's just been very testing, but couldn't be more proud.
