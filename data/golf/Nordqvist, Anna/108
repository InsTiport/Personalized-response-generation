 Q.   Well that was awesome.   Heck of a day.  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah it was good.  
   
 Q.   Not as many low scores.   By far the lowest that's come through.   Any harder conditions?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, I mean, I haven't hit the ball‑‑ I didn't hit the ball very well the first two days, but today I hit it much better.   I think I hit 17 greens today, which made it a little easier.  
Pretty good seed a greens all week.   But it was nice.   I had a couple tap‑ins after the break, and just felt like I gave myself a lot of chances.  
   
 Q.   And nothing on the course that really stuck out to you that was particularly challenging?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, I mean, I think this course is pretty challenging as it is.   Couple back pins, couple tucked pins.  
But certain holes you just got to play for the middle of the green and take your two‑putt and go.   Where you can be aggressive, you can be aggressive.  
With the break in there, you got to get your mind straight after that.  
   
 Q.   Moving day on Saturday.   How happy were you to move up?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I'm very, very happy with the day.   6‑under, I'll take that any day.   I feel like my ball‑striking is much better today.   That's all I can ask for.  
   
 Q.   (Question regarding the delay.)  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, you kind of know that there is probably going to be delays.   You just got to make the best out of it.   Same for everyone.  
   
 Q.   How are the greens playing?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I still think the longer irons still release on these greens.   I felt the greens might have got a little slower after the rain delay.  
But overall, I think they have been rolling very good this week.   Obvious they haven't had much rain, so playing a little firm at times.
