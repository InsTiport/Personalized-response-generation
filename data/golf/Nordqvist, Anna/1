  Q. Anna, 2-under; nice birdie on the Par 5, 9th to head into the weekend at 6-under overall.  How did the game feel today to see your name right there at the top of the leaderboard?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I feel like it was really solid probably the last 10, 11, 12 holes.  It was really windy when we warmed up.  It was kind of weird.  I feel like the wind carried on the back nine, then started laying off when we were on 16, 17 there.
 So it was kind of a weird start, but I felt like I kept grinding and hit a lot of good shots on the back nine, a lot of good drives.  Rolling the putter well.
 So I feel like I gave myself a couple really good opportunities on the back.
 Q. Two time major champ, so seeing your name at the top of a leaderboard heading into the weekend at a major isn't unfamiliar territory.  What can you take from the past experiences into the weekend here at Mission Hills?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Well, having won two before I think, I mean, those are the ones that motivate me to go practice every day.  If you got a little bit of a taste of it, like it's just such an incredible feeling.
 So I keep working hard and I try to put myself in the same position again.  Sure, there is going to be some good scores this afternoon, but I feel like pretty solid with my game and I feel like it's trending in the right direction, and that's really all I can do.
 I'm just very happy with the game.
 Q. You just look happier and more comfortable than you have in a long time.  Are we right in assuming that, and what's up?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I mean, I definitely think when I got mono it kind of threw me for a loop.  At the same time, I was trying to do some swing changes and just didn't really go in to the right way.
 So I feel like the last two years I've had a really good team around me.  Kev has been a big part of it, so I'm very happy off the course.  Moved back to Scottsdale where to feel like home and a lot of good people on my team.  I think -- I'm 33 so it's just not my first year out here.  I have worked with Paul now for over two years, so I think I'm a lot more confident and comfortable just knowing that I have a good team around me.
