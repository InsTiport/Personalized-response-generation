Q. Tried to win this event for the third time in a row.  It looks like you'll come up a bit short.  What was the difference today?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I feel like I hit a lot of good shots today, especially coming down the stretch.
15 kind of killed us hitting way too much club and being over the green and not the best of lies.  They've all been coming out bad, and came jumping forward.
Feel like I had a good putt on 14, 12, 16, and 17, but just got a little mucky.  Got in between yardages on both 16 and 18, but I was in contention and I'm happy, so it's been a great week.
Q. What has this process been like to try to win it for the third time, and also join Annika and Betsy King as the only player to have won this three times?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, just having the honor to back-to-back defend is quite amazing.  I've had a lot of supporters cheering me on this week, and I really appreciate everyone's support.
There is a little bit of pressure coming into it, but it's just been fun.  I'm trying to embrace it.  I love this golf course, I love hitting the shots.
It's been really windy the last two days.  The way I'm controlling the ball I'm really happy with.  Just seem to be doing the right stuff, so I'm excited for the next couple weeks.
