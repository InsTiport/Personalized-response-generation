Q.   A crazy week, but in the end, a good week for you.   You'll probably be tied for third.   Just tell me how you played? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I felt like I played really good all week.   I couldn't really get anything going on the greens yesterday, but it's been hard conditions, especially the last two days.   Today you're fighting the wind, and you try to make birdies and make a move, but it's hard because it's blowing so much.

Q.   Just talk about the week overall.   Kind of an odd situation with the 12 holes a day.   Did it throw you off?   Did you do anything differently this week? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, I mean, it is what it is.   It's the same for everyone. 
It reminded me a little bit of Jamaica that I won in 2010, so that was like golfing six holes, but I think I learned a lot this week.   It felt like a sprint this week instead of a marathon.
