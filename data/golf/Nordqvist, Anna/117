 Q.   Lost a couple of par today, but still minus‑2 for the championship.   What were the conditions like for to you today?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It was brutal at times.   I didn't feel like I hit a bad shot first three holes and I started bogey, bogey, bogey.   
You know, it's just penalizing.   It's hard when you don't get rewarded for good shots, but that's the beauty of the game, I guess.   But I made a couple of bogeys early on, and it was just a matter of staying mentally tough and grinding it out and hanging in there.   I think I managed to make three birdies on the back nine and shoot 2‑over par for the day, which I'm very happy about.   It was tough out there.  
   
 Q.   The U.S. Open is always about the difficulty factor, and you're only right now 5 shots off the lead and there are two rounds to play.   That's got to be something that you can say I'm near.   I can make a move; right?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Absolutely.   It feels like the U.S. Open is all about surviving.   Surviving the first couple of days and then you never know what's going to happen over the weekend or even on Sunday.   I believe they just make it even tougher for the weekend, so I feel like I'm in a good spot.   You just keep grinding, and hope I'm there on Sunday.
