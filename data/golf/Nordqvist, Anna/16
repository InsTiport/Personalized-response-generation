Q. Tough day out there today with the wind; how do you think you fared in these kind of conditions?
ANNA NORDQVIST: It was blowing so hard today.  Like I don't think -- I mean, if the greens wouldn't have been as -- not like a lot of grass on them, I think the balls would have been moving.  I'm so proud of myself for keeping it together today because it was really hard, and all the holes into the wind played really long.  But yeah, it's not an easy shot.  Even if you have 100 yards in and you're playing it to go 25 yards into the wind.  There was some fun shots.  I hit a 4-iron 140 yards today, and then I hit a pitching wedge in on a par-5.  I don't ever remember doing that, like 150 or 160 yards.  But yeah, I played great.  I had a few good looks, and in the end I just didn't make the putts.  But nice to finish with a birdie, and it's been a great week this week.
Q. You've got a great history here at this tournament.  What does that say about how comfortable you feel out there on the course?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I do.  You need to hit good golf shots, and I think I like that.  I played so well yesterday and just didn't really finish well the last two holes.  But just really one bad shot in that wind.  I do love it here, and it's not an easy course even though it's short.  I think it just gives me a lot of confidence, and I feel like I've been close for a long time, and my game has been way better, so it's nice to actually get a good finish, too.
