Q.   Just talk about this round.   I know it's a little bit different than how it played this morning for you.   Just talk about how different it was. 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I'm very disappointed.   I didn't make my putts for birdie and we never really got any momentum.   We didn't seem to make the putts when we needed to. 
We hit it pretty good on 14 and then she makes a bunker shot.   So it was a tough match.   They played great.

Q.   What was it like playing with Giulia?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It was great.   But we never seemed to get any momentum.   They made putts for birdies and they played tough.
