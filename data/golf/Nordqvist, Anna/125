 Q. How do you think you played coming from the first hole, kind of a shaky start? You were struggling to get back on. 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I think that we put pressure on them all the time, and we weren't really able to make the putts, the momentum putts. But I think we played great. 
 They managed to have the luck on their side today.

 Q. The weather held out for you. Are you happy with that? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, it's been great. The weather's been great and good conditions, good scoring conditions.

 Q. Anything you have to work on for the rest of today? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, absolutely not. The game is right there. So I just hope to play this afternoon and we'll see where it goes.

 Q. Rest of the matches seem to be going well. So what do you think?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I think Europe's off to a good start, so that's all you can do.
