 Q.  Well Anna, not the finish you would have wanted, but you must be pretty happy your start to your title defense?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, I played really solid today.  It was really hard wind.  It was gusty and very cold, so it was hard to gauge yardages.   
I mean, flushed my approach shot on the last (indiscernible) carry for 15 yards to beat that, so it wasn't the finish what I wanted, but I hit a good shot.  (Indiscernible) in that spot.   
Seems to be playing a little harder this year.  The golf course is a little different.  The wind and the cold this morning was really tough.   
 Q.  You obviously know this golf course very well.  Coming back here, must have had great memories of last year.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, it's hard to compare from a year ago because it's playing a little bit different, a little bit more lush.  I've just never seen this wind or this cold here at this event before.   
It's good challenge.   
 Q.  Not including the last hole, what were the highlights of your round and what was working well for you today?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, I was never really in trouble.  Yeah, I had a good putt on 8 for par, but other than that I wasn't even really scrambling for par.  I was making easy pars.  Gave myself quite a bit of opportunities.   
It was just a matter of trying to get the distances right with it being cold, and it's playing two clubs into the wind.   
 Q.  What was the wind like?  Did it pick up more as the round unfolded?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: No.  I feel like it was up there this morning, but it got a little bit gusty.  I think the wind must have laid down a little bit on my last shot.   
But, yeah, it was a little bit hard to judge.  I think we're just not used to this.
