   ANNA NORDQVIST: I started really good. Couldn't really get into my tempo. Missed a lot of shots.   
 Just trying to hang in there with a good short game.   
  
  Q. Did you play last year?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I didn't.   
  
  Q. So first round, first time HSBC, what's your overall impression of the tournament?   
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I love this tournament. First time in Singapore, and only good memories so far. A lot of good players here obviously. Tough competition. But you know, the course is great. The course is in great shape, so I just love being here.  
  
  Q. What expectations and targets have you set for yourself this week?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I'm just trying to get back to it. I had a couple weeks off for the off-season, so you know, you just want to try to find your rhythm, find your tempo and get back to it.  
  
  Q. What would you be focusing on tomorrow to move up the leaderboard?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Just do the best I can and take one shot at a time. We will try to focus on that and then we'll see how it goes.
