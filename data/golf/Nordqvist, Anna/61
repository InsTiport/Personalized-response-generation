ANNA NORDQVIST: I used to like this place.  Had a week off last week, went back to Sweden for a couple days.  Didn't practice much.  But I went down to see the kids, between 12 and 18 years, got a lot of inspiration from them.  I think even though I haven't practiced much coming into this week, but coming here, I have great memories from the past and hit my irons really well today.  I'm stuffing them really close and I think seven of my birdies were inside six or seven feet.  So great day.
Q. That was the first time since you've been back since Christmas.  Did the girls say they were going to be watching you this week?
ANNA NORDQVIST: They were pretty shocked that I showed up.  No one knew I was coming back.  They were pretty shocked, they know I'm in the U.S.  I'm just glad I could go and I was hoping to give them a little bit of inspiration, but I think a got a lot of inspiration from them.  Hopefully we'll be watching.  They will probably be out practicing.
