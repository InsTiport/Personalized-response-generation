 Q.  Michelle obviously pulled out after 12 holes.  Just wondering what she said to you and Yokomine before she left.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean I know she's been struggling with her -- I think her wrist, and she looked very taped up this morning.  My caddie is a good friend with her caddie.  So knew that she was struggling a little bit.  She didn't get off to a great start either, and the conditions weren't easy.  With the ground being firm, if you have any sort of wrist problems, it's not going to be favorable.   
 Q.  Sure.  What did she say when she left you guys?  Did she just apologize?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah.  She just said, "I'm sorry, but I'm going to walk off."
