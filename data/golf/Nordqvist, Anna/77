Q.   You have to be pretty pleased after that round today, don't you?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, it was solid.   I hit a lot of greens.   Had a lot of good putts that didn't go in, so it was just a matter of staying patient.   Hit a great shot out of the bunker on 15 to about I think nine feet and made that one for birdie and then birdied 16. 
So those felt nice.   But I had some good putts there that didn't go in.   So pretty happy with my finish there.   But it's been solid.   Last week was solid and this week's been pretty solid, so I file like I'm playing pretty good golf.   Just a matter of staying patient.

Q.   Last year you had a hot start, and like you said you're playing well; is this something you think is going to continue on?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I hope so.   Last week, I felt like I hit it as goods I've done that long time.   On Sunday I couldn't make any putts, so I left Thailand disappointed. 
Just feel like I'm giving myself some good opportunities out there.   The greens are firm.   It's been a little bit of wind today, so it's hard to really get close to some of the pins.   But it's the same for everyone and I think that makes it more challenging and you've got to hit good shots to make birdies.

Q.   Right now you're sitting three strokes off the lead, your approach heading into tomorrow, do you even know yet?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I really have nothing to lose.   Just try to putt a good round out there today and give myself a chance tomorrow.   That's all I can do.   You know, there's a lot of good players up there and it seems like everyone is playing pretty solid, so it's going to require a good one tomorrow. 

Q.   Last question regarding your twin today, Danielle Kang.   Did you guys plan this or was it a surprise on the first tee?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   We had this outing with TaylorMade‑Adidas on Monday, and I was freaking out if we were wearing the same thing, and we weren't.   And then we said‑‑ we were joking and said, hey, if we get paired this week, we should totally do it. 
I had a feeling we might get paired when I saw the scoreboard yesterday.   And so I told her, you get the turquoise outfit, and she said, yeah, I do, and then I didn't hear back from her. 
I said, whatever, I'll put it on.   This morning, sure enough, she had it.   Yeah, it was planned, but it's all about having fun and Adidas is such a great sponsor and we love the clothes and wear the same golf bags, too, so couldn't be more twins.
