Q. How do you feel about your game heading into this week?
ANNA NORDQVIST: It's about.  It's been solid the last couple months, but haven't really able to quite get the scores together.  I like it here.  Happy to be back.
Q. How much confidence do you get from a good finish when you see the results come together?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I think definitely it gives you a little bit more peace about the things you're doing and you work on the right stuff.  Hit it really well at Evian for two days.  A couple bad breaks on the back nine, and missed the cut and you're sitting out the weekend and that's definitely not going to boost your confidence, especially when you're hitting it good.  It's a fine line.  But it's just nice to see what I've been working on for a long time is starting to pay off a little bit.
Q. You said you like this course.  How does it set up for you?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, we walked the course yesterday.  It's crazy.  Some holes plays really long and I think some of these greens, you're supposed to have a long club into.  It's going to be tricky because just the way the greens are and especially if we get some wind.  But it's a good test.
Q. Obviously have to ask, Solheim Cup, the final week to qualify.  How are you feeling about where you stand?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I feel pretty good.  Obviously for a long time it's been on my mind, and I'm kind of excited about the whole qualifying process because there's so much talk about it, and everyone's -- I don't know, there's a lot of talk of who is going to make the team and there's just a lot of speculation.  I'm going to try to focus on my game this week and if I do well, I know I'll be there.
