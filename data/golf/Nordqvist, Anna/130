 Q. Nice playing today. Just talk about the round. 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Um, well, been practicing really hard these last couple weeks. My game feels better and better. I hit my irons really solid today and got a lot of good chances out there. I was rolling very well, so a lot of birdies.
 I had a lot of fun.

 Q. You kind of got hot on the back nine. What was it, four birdies in the last five or six holes or something like that? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I had a couple good chances the first couple holes and was pretty close to make them, but then I think I hit my wedge shot to like one feet on No. 5 there, and then two or three more close. So that always helps.

 Q. Cool. How about the conditions of the course, the wind? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I think the course is in great shape. Got a little bit windy there at the turn and on the back nine. There are a lot of accessible pins today, so you can just fire at it.
 You know, I think it's playing fair. There's a lot of good birdies opportunities there, so it makes golf fun.

 Q. The wind blew harder earlier this week. As far as what you prepared for, were the conditions different from practicing?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I mean, I never been in Alabama before, so I didn't really know what to expect. It was a little bit chilly there, I must admit, even being Swedish, Tuesday morning. 
 But I think it calmed down a little bit yesterday, and today wasn't that bad.
