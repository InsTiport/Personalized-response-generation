Q. Feel like you're in a good spot going into tomorrow?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Definitely.  I feel I played pretty good out there.  It was really tough wind this afternoon.  A little hard to judge the direction.  And then 17, 18 played dead into the wind.  Made those holes a little tougher.
But I shot 3-under today and I'm two shots out of it, and I feel like I'm in a good spot.
Q. Similarity to last year, coming from behind and knowing that you can do it on this course?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, definitely.  I feel like I hit a lot of good shots and a lot of good putts today.  Greens were pretty bumpy and some of my putts even airborne.  You've just got to stay patient and tomorrow we are just going to have more similar conditions.  So I'm excited to go for it tomorrow.
Q. They are bumping the tee times up tomorrow they announced earlier, so you'll be teeing off earlier, like 6:45 start time.  Do you think that will help?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, I know I have to post a low number tomorrow.  It's just going to be more similar playing conditions I think tomorrow and the greens are going to be a little bit better, so hopefully I can take advantage of that.  But I feel great about my game and you know, give myself a lot of chances out there.  Whatever happens tomorrow, it happens.
But I'm feeling confident, so I'm excited.
Q. Do you feel like you're hitting it as well tee-to-green as you were hitting it yesterday?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yesterday, I don't know how many -- I stuffed it close.  It was a little bit of a ball-striking show yesterday.  Today it was just a little harder with the wind but I still feel like I hit a lot of good iron shots, but it was just hard to make putts.
