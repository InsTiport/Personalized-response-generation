Q.   All right.   We're here with Anna Nordqvist after a great round out there today, 4‑under.   Congratulations.   Can you just take me through your round out there and what was working well for you?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Well, it was really solid.   I think I hit 16 greens solid to set it up pretty good.   I put it on the right spot on the greens.   There were some really tough hole locations overall today, so it was hard to get to them.   But I gave myself good birdie opportunities and I'm in an interview.

Q.   Definitely different conditions out there today than we had yesterday.   What was the biggest key today to being successful out there?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Well, it was so windy out there yesterday, so anything less windy than that is going to be a positive surprise this morning. 
It was still pretty windy in the beginning, but I think the key is trying to hit the fairways and put yourself on the greens.

Q.   This week's a little different than most weeks being it's only a 54‑hole event.   Tomorrow is the final round.   How do you feel about the position you've put yourself in?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I feel great.   I gave myself a lot of opportunities today.   And I think I shot myself right back at it.   And I'm ready for it.   It'll be fun.

Q.   And how would you say your season has gone to this point?   Not as good as you think or better than you thought?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No.   I've been playing pretty solid golf.   Haven't really made a lot of putts in the beginning of the year.   So it's been solid.   Obviously you don't make a lot of putts, you're not going to score that great.

Q.   Does it get frustrating after a while that the ball striking is much better than the putting?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It does.   But I've been working on good stuff and starting to come along and making a lot of good putts the last couple weeks, so I think I'm working on the right stuff.

Q.   And how did you feel the putting went today?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Putting was great.   I made a lot of short birdie putts, and I made I think two putts over 20 feet.   So that was great.

Q.   Did you see a big difference in the greens between yesterday and today?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, absolutely.   Especially in the afternoon.   Yesterday it was so windy, so they dried out pretty good, and even from the practice rounds they still (indiscernible) yesterday, but today you were putting spin on the wedges and it's tough to get them close when they were tucked in the corners or tucked in the back corners because you can't really fly it all the way.

Q.   So you think they'll be the same pins tomorrow, like very tough you think?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I hope so.   It brings out the best in everyone.   It's a great challenge for all of us.
