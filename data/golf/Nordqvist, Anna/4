  Q. First off, you were able to fight back after the front nine with an amazing back nine with three birdies there.  Playing with Annika, I know you have a special relationship.  This was technically only the second time you played together, correct?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I had asked if she wanted to play a practice round with me this week because I never played with her, so it was awesome to get the opportunity to play with her on Monday, and obviously to be able to tee it up.
 I admire her so much, and just to see her in person playing, I know she hasn't been practicing too much, but you can tell the level she's been at.
 This is going to be definitely one the more memorable rounds in my career.
