  ANNA NORDQVIST:   I played great today, hit most of the fairways and most of the greens and felt like I had pretty good speed on the greens, left a couple short at the end.   But overall very happy with the start and my game feels solid.  
   
 Q.   Putter was working well for you; even at 17 you had that long putt and you almost drained that.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, overall I had a lot of good putts that I hit that I didn't make, and I had some putts that I made, too.   So I'm obviously very happy that my putting is coming along.   So Yeon played great today, and I'm two behind.   I can't ask for more for the first day.  
   
 Q.   Just a quick comment on the greens.   As you know, we've had problems over the winter.   They did a lot of work to get this course ready.   Did they roll pretty true?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, the course is great.   It's a treat to come here.   Some of them were a little bit bumpy, but it's been a long day, a lot of play on these greens.   But overall you can put yourself in position to make a lot of birdies out here, and that's what I felt I did.   It's going to be a fun tournament, this one.  
   
 Q.   Is it fun when you're playing so well together when you're in the same group and also pushing each other?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, absolutely.   She made nine birdies today and I made seven, so it's definitely‑‑ it gives you a lot of momentum, a lot of positive energy, just seeing a lot of birdies.
