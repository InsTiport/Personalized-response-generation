Q. Overall your thoughts on the day?  Another solid round for you?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I'm happy with my round.  Disappointed that we couldn't finish -- Brittany was about to tap-in her foot-and-a-half-er and I was going to putt my 50-footer at the last.  A little disappointed that we had to stick around for the late but overall, it's a pretty solid day, 3-under par today, 4-under par yesterday.
Just a lot of good shots.  Felt like I've been playing really consistent out there and really haven't had to scramble for any pars these last two days.
You know, happy where my game's at.  Played really well this China last week.  I feel like I'm in a good spot for the weekend.
Q. How tough is it to only have one or two putts left and then have to sit around for an hour and a half?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, we knew it was going to be cutting it close, and we saw the rules official on the last green, so we were kind of surprised that they wouldn't, you know, see that we were so close.  But you know, I had a good chat with my friends and kind of just relaxed and hit a good putt on the last, didn't go in.
Q. What's your approach going into the final two rounds around here?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, there's a lot of good scores out there.  The course is in as good of shape as I've seen it.  You know, I can only do what I can do, but I feel like I've been playing solid and hopefully can get a couple more putts to drop for the weekend.  But just really happy and just taking it one day at a time.
