Q. Your 9th career start here, out in 32, back in 35.  Carding four birdies in her first six holes.  What was working out there for you today?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I got off to a really good start and had a lot of good birdie chances and hit a lot of good putts, obviously.  It definitely helped to get off to a good start.  Slowed down a little bit, had a few good saves at the turn, a couple of good chances at the end.
I'm really happy with 5-under, I feel like the greens were pretty speedy today.  It's something I enjoy and something we don't get to putt on a lot.  So the course is in such good shape.  Obviously I've been here a lot.  So I'm happy to be back.
Q. Course conditions, weather conditions very different than last week.  How comfortable were you out there today?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I enjoyed these conditions a lot more than last week.  Even though I grew up in cold weather, I think it's little too cold for me.  Definitely feel a little more energized after today's round than some of the rounds last week, it was just so cold.
Q. So this is the last event before the Major Championship at Evian where you're the defending champion.  How important is it for you to do well this week?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I think I just got off to such a slow start this year, and just haven't really got a lot of things going.  I had a great finish last week.  Hopefully I can just peak now at the end of the season.  There's a lot of good events coming up, and obviously going back to Evian is going to be so special for me this year, and probably every year from now on.  But I feel pretty good about my game, and obviously hope to have a strong finish to the year.
