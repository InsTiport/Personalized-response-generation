Q. Anna, great opening round 64; no bogeys on the card.  Tell us about your opening round out here today.
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I feel like I played really solid today.  Got off to a great start with two birdies.  Just kept hitting it close, so I had really close calls for birdie.  So I think after ten holes I had six really close birdie putts and I made them all, which was good.
It got a little breezy today.  Felt like some of those holes when we made the turn 2, 3, 4, played really tough.  But it was nice to birdie 7, and gave myself a couple more good opportunities coming in.
Overall, really solid.
Q. How well are you hitting the ball right now?  It looks like you hit 17 of 18 greens out there today.
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, today was really good.  I feel like I've done a lot of good things the last couple weeks.  It just hasn't really paid off.  It's been a little bit disappointing, a little bit frustrating.
But had a pretty good talk with my caddie and fiancee the beginning of the week, and I feel like they kept me in it.
Q. What were some the messages they sent to you?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I feel like even last week I did a lot of good things.  Just really wasn't the weekend that I was hoping for.  I think just putting things in perspective, and, you know, when you do a lot of good things and it's really not paying off it can get frustrating instead of really taking the positive.
So trying to see a lot of the positives from the last couple weeks.
Q. And how do you approach a week like this where there is usually a lot of birdies out here at Pinnacle Country Club, especially coming off a challenging week at Royal Troon last week?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I mean, I probably felt like I was hitting a little bit more golf balls this week leading up to the event on Wednesday and Thursday just because it was so windy last week.
But you know this golf course.  I've played so many years here, so I think I only played really 18 holes of practice round.  But you know the shots, and I feel like try to rest because it was a long couple weeks.  It's my fifth week on the road.
