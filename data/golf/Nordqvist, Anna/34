 Q.  I was just telling him you look very fit.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Thank you.  Well, I wasn't healthy last year, so that probably...   
 Q.  I was going to say, was that a point of emphasis in the off-season?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I think it came to the point, like last year I wasn't allowed to work out and I know how shitty I felt at times.   
It wasn't hard to find the motivation to be fitter or not be heavy breathing up the hill because you're exhausted.  So, yeah, worked out hard during the off-season and feel like I'm back being healthy.   
 Q.  Who is your trainer?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I worked out with my trainer Ara Suppiah this off-season.   
 Q.  Oh, I've seen this on Twitter.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah.  We worked out together.  He was my training partner, so we worked out together this off-season in Orlando.   
 Q.  Great round today.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Thank you.   
 Q.  What's clicking on all cylinders right now?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, it's been a little bit of slow start to the year because I don't feel like I putted very well.  I haven't got a lot of putts to drop.   
It got a little bit windy out there yesterday afternoon, so I think that was definitely an advantage today, knowing a little bit how the ball was flying.   
Hit the ball really well today.  I think, yeah, I basically hit all the -- I was on the fringe on 18, but hit the rest of the greens.  Hit it pretty close today and made a few of those close birdies, which helped.   
But, yeah, I mean, I feel pretty good.  It was a hard week last week in Phoenix because I felt like I hit the ball really well but just couldn't get a putt to drop.   
 Q.  You have a very consistent record at the ANA; a lot of top 10 finishes.  Kind of your thoughts on how that course suits your game and how your game is going into a major week.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean...   
 Q.  This course is so different.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, it's very different.  I mean, I love the atmosphere there and the way the course is set up.  Usually I like it when the rough is up.   
You have to hit good golf shots, so I think that a tougher golf course probably suits me more.  Over the years I just love Palm Springs.  Went to school in Phoenix, so I probably love the desert.   
 Q.  Do you feel like the putting thing is something that you need to change your technique at all?  Is it just alignment?  You're just close?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I mean, me and Cameron worked really hard on the putting all off-season.  Probably just need to stay patient.  I rolled it really well today and there was a lot of them that didn't go in.   
Even at first today.  I felt like I hit a lot of good rolls on the putts, which it's definitely an advantage.   
 Q.  So you're just close?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah.  I'm probably closer than what I want to admit.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Just one quick question about coming from this golf course to that golf course.  They're so different; the greens are so different.  When you miss putts here, can you easily forget that when you get to completely different greens next week?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, this is a tough one.  I felt like I had two good strokes on I think a three-footer and four-footer yesterday on birdie putts and ended up missing them both.   
It's just very, very different even this week from last week and then last week from Singapore.  I think in the beginning of the year like it's just really different conditions.  Ball doesn't fly as far as it did last week, and probably doesn't fly as far here this week as it's going to do next week.   
I think doesn't help doing it in the past, but just getting dialed in with the yardages and stuff like that, and I feel like we've done a good job.   
 Q.  Having won the last major that was played, do you feel different going into the next one?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, winning a second major was my goal for such a long time.  It was my biggest motivator, and I ended up winning that probably when I least expected it.   
I don't think anything has changed.  I love usually the major setups.  Nothing I'm really going to change.  Obviously it's great to know -- I mean, walking up to the first tee and getting announced as two-time major champion, I think it's moments like that you really like feel proud.   
But I feel my game is in a pretty good spot.  It's only my fourth event of the year.  Just keep working at it.  Days like today golf seems pretty simple.  It won't always.   
 Q.  Did they say that on the first tee today, two-time major champion.  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah.  It was a pretty cool feeling.   
 Q.  I just have one last question.  Lexi will be going back to ANA where a lot of drama happened last year.  I asked Michelle this, too.  You've experienced some drama in the game before.  How do you put that aside?  Obviously you're not going back to CordeValle, but...  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, hopefully she doesn't see last year as a defeat.  She did play the best out of all of us.  There is no doubt about it.  She'd probably going to feel a lot better having played next week.   
 Q.  You mean when it's over?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah.  It's always like facing the controversy.  She's going to get a lot of questions about it, especially being in that place.  She's done well there in the past, so I think she'll definitely feel very relieved when next week is over.  I think she'll be a strong contender.
