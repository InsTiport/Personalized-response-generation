Q. Yani, did you say you were the oldest?  You've been our champion the longest.  That's right.  So you won the tournament a year when we played at LaCosta.  You've played in our events here at Aviara.  Tell us some your favorite holes here at Aviara.
YANI TSENG: I think 18 hole is tough.  It's little bit (indiscernible) to that hole.  I think this course is a great finish hole, last four holes coming in.  To finish the tournament you got to -- it will be nice if you have like a three-shot lead going into the last hole and then play on this course.
Q. A lot of people playing in the pro-am tomorrow so they'll see how hard the 18th hole is.  Luckily it's a scramble.  Thanks for being here, Yani.  Beatriz, so Carlsbad is such a pretty place, and I'm sure you enjoy coming here year after year.  What's your favorite thing to do here besides play golf?
BEATRIZ RECARI: Well, there are so many cool places to eat and I'm definitely a foodie, so I wake up and I go to my coffee place and I go to my mid-morning snack, then afternoon snack, then dinner.  I take my food intake very seriously.
There are so many wonderful places to eat.  The whole vibe of this town, it's amazing.  It's very beautiful.  Just makes me feel very comfortable.  You don't get to go to many places where you love the golf course and you love the town you're staying in and you get to enjoy a little bit of the surroundings.
So I'm always very happy to come back.
Q. Anna, we've known each other for a long time.  I think you may be one - and we'll have to have the stats checked - but I think you've played in every Kia Classic, and I don't think you've missed a cut in the Kia Classic yet.
ANNA NORDQVIST: No jinxing.
Q. No jinxing.  But when we see each other on the road you always say that Aviara is one of your favorite places to come back to.  What are some of your favorite things about this, the golf, the tournament, partners like Kia?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I think what you and Lindsay and the rest of the team has created here, along with Kia, is very special.  I think it's one of the best-run tournaments we have on tour, it always feel very special.  Aviara I think is a great golf course; pretty tough golf holes.
You guys just always make it feel very special coming here.  I think we all love coming here.
Q. Lydia, when you won in 2016 you also won the next event, the ANA Inspiration.  How does playing Aviara set you up for playing in the next major?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, this is a pretty tough golf course, but it has a really good balance between some holes that are birdieable and some that if you're coming off with par it's a pretty good score, like the 18th hole.
I always love playing prior to a major championship so it's always a good buildup, and especially when you do have a good finish the week before.  Obviously with ANA being our first major of the year, you do want to go in with a bit of confidence.
Yeah, two different style of golf courses, but I think it's a great leadup towards our first major.
Q. Mirim, minus 20.  20-under par.  You guys all hear that?  She shot 20-under par when she won the tournament.  I'll tell you this:  You're all playing a scramble in the pro-am tomorrow and you won't shoot 20-under.  Is this course easy or hard?
MIRIM LEE: I think difficult.  This course is tough and then not easy, so...
Q. What makes it hard?
MIRIM LEE: Greens, and then driver is hard, too.
Q. Chipping, putting, the greens, driving is hard, the rough.  Eun-Hee, you made a hole in one and won the tournament last year.  How exciting of a week was it for you?
EUN-HEE JI: It was very, very exciting.  Yeah, I got two cars on one tournament, so just enjoy driving my cars, Stinger and Sorento.  Yeah.
Q. Thank you all for being here and representing the tournament so graciously.
