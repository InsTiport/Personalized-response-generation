   JASON TAYLOR: Anna, thank you for coming in. You had a pretty nice opening round at the McDonald's LPGA Championship, 6-under par, co-leader right now a career low for you, 66. So if you would, talk a little bit about the course and how your day went. 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: The course is in such good shape and the greens are rolling well, so if you're rolling your putts, you can score out there. 
 I feel like I played really solid today. Hit a lot of good shots on the first nine and made a couple of putts, and then I lost some momentum in the turn. I had to wait a little bit and then I was able to get back and finish strong. Made a couple of good putts out there in a row, real solid, and had a lot of good opportunities. 

 Q. Is this a round you saw coming or how you've been playing lately, or is it sort of out of the blue?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I've been working hard with my coaches. Playing solid and been putting good lately, so that really helps if you want to score good.

 Q. How does it feel to be at the top of the leaderboard? You're a rookie, and you haven't been on the Tour long, and here you are leading everyone. 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Obviously this is where you want to be. I'm a rookie and haven't played that much this year, but, I mean, I'm here to learn, and just have fun. There's three more days and I really look forward to this week. 

 Q. How did the course play today with all of the rain we've had the last couple of days? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, it's still in such good shape. You don't get that much roll on the fairways, but I mean, the greens are really smooth. Obviously the rough is pretty thick but I think it's in great shape, and I mean, it's a pleasure to be here. 

 Q. Could you just talk a little bit about some of the things you have learned so far this year?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: It's been an adjustment, I mean, coming up from college and going straight to the Tour. 
 I mean, I think you've got to learn to live this lifestyle. I learned, travelling that much, not being home, you play week-after-week. I mean, that's something that's new to me. In college, you play a tournament, you have a week or a week and a half off before you go to the next.
 So it's just a matter of getting -- learning how to prepare for tournaments. I mean, you don't want to practice too much and you don't want to practice too little. It's just getting that balance with everything. I mean, obviously golf is my work now and I don't have school, so you can spend 24 hours on the golf course. It's just being -- I think the biggest lesson is kind of balancing everything. 

 Q. Can you talk about being a rookie out here and you sort of have stars in your eyes when you see players like Paula, like Cristie Kerr, like Michelle, or are you sort of one of the girls?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I really look up to Lorena, Paula, I mean, there's a lot of good players. There's a lot to learn from them. A few of them have been out here for a couple of years, and I mean, just -- I mean, overall, I think you learn a lot and it's just a great experience to play the same weeks as they do.

 Q. What were your expectations coming into the season in terms of your own success? Do you feel like you have enough game to win out here right away, or is this going to be a longer process for you? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I mean, I think you have to be patient. Coming into this year, I don't think I can expect too much. The biggest goal for this year is to learn as much as I can; learn how to travel and learn the courses. I don't have many expectations for this year, but I think just going to go out there and have fun and see where you end up. 

 Q. What will you do the rest of today? Will you stick around and watch the scoreboard, or do you feel any nerves as you wait? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I mean, this is just the first day. There's three more days. I really look forward to that. I'll have lunch after this and probably practice a little bit and then I'll go home and rest. I was up pretty early this morning. 

 Q. Will you watch the scoreboard?
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I mean, I can't really do anything about it. 

 Q. What time were you up this morning? 
 ANNA NORDQVIST: 4:30. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Thanks, Anna.
