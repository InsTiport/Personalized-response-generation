  Q. How do you summarize your round today?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I fought hard today. I didn't hit my irons very well, but hung in there with a good short game. Made a couple easy mistakes coming in, but it is what it is. Had a good chance for birdie on 18 but I didn't make it.  
 But I'm only one shot out and I look forward to tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What did you struggle with, if anything?   
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I just didn't hit my irons very well today. Driver was good and most of my wedges was pretty good. But just couldn't get my irons going.  
  
  Q. You were talking coming in --  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: I hit it a little bit thin and made bogey from nowhere. I thought I hit a good putt on 18.   
  
  Q. And how do you feel coming into tomorrow? As you said, you're in pretty good position.   
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, absolutely, I have nothing to lose, just going to go out there fire at it.   
  
  Q. Have you had a chance to go head-to-head with Melissa or Tinning? Have you had a situation on Sunday where you've played with them?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: No, I never played with them on a Sunday. I think they are going to be in the leading group. So it's always nice to come-from-behind.
