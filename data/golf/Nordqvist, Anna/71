 Q.  Disappointing this morning, but you turned it around this afternoon.  How did you do that?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I didn't feel that me and Suzann played all that bad this morning, just really couldn't make any putts.  So I was actually surprised that she was sitting out this afternoon.   
But I played with Caroline Hedwall and just seemed to play great, got off to a good start.  Made a good birdie on 2, after Morgan made her birdie.  Just really enjoyed it and very excited.   
 Q.  Caroline, those first few holes, you probably weren't at your very best.  From 8 onwards, you played great?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I think I was a little too pumped in the beginning, I just went for everything.  And then I was, I'm going to hold back a little bit now.  But it was great watching her.  She played unbelievable golf.  And I just hung around.  But it felt solid, like you said, after 7, 8.  I think we played a great best ball after that.
