Q.   How does it feel?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah.   I mean it's Mother's Day in Sweden today, and it's actually my first tournament I had any kind of family when I won, and my mom's been here.

Q.   Today is mother's day in Sweden?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah.

Q.   How special was that hug from her then?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   That was pretty special because my mom's been there through thick and then, and you know, helped me through my downs and pushed me through my ups.   So very special.
