Q. Anna, by my count, 8 birdies in 15 holes.  Did the format make you stay that much more aggressive?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I felt really well today.  I hit it pretty good this morning, too, just couldn't get anything going.  But playing with Caroline Hedwall, our game seemed to be on today.  I had a lot of chances and made quite a few putts.  I still had a couple that got by.  I was very excited.
Q. Caroline, Judy Rankin made a great observation.  You finished a different player than you started today.  What happened?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I think I was just way too pumped in the beginning.  I wanted to go for everything, and especially with this format.
