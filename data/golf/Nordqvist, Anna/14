 Q.  I think you're very happy with your round today?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: I played great today. I've not been playing the greatest the last couple days. I have no voice and my throat's pretty sore, but I'm pretty happy with my performance today.   
 Q.  A little too early for a complete resumÃ©; you just hope it's going to come out good in the end. But how happy are you with your personal performance this weekend?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Obviously, I'm happy with my match today, and I needed to get my point and I did. I feel like I putted pretty solid in the other two, just had trouble making birdies in the fourball.   
And I think me and Anne did a lot better than we (indiscernible) yesterday. It was a small margins. Looking pretty tight, but hopefully Europe can finish strong.   
 Q.  Can you sum up the emotions in this moment?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Extremely proud of myself and the team this week, and to play great, go out there and win my point, it's a great feeling.   
 Q.  Here at Gleneagles, loads of home support. Does that help you out there today?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, definitely, had my family here all week. Friends, my fiance is from here and all his friends came out. It's been an incredible week to play for them.   
I didn't have a perfect day, but they helped me push through. (Indiscernible) and 15. Can't get any better than that. And to play (indiscernible) -- I think we're going to head over to 18.
