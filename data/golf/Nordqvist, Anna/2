  Q. (Regarding conditions playing later in the day. )
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Well, the course is so good.  I don't think I've ever seen it this well.  A little bit of cloud cover today kept it from being super hot.  The greens are really firm so there are a few pins you can't really attack, and you just hit it in a place where you can take a two-putt or get it up and down.
 I didn't really capitalize on the par-5s today, but there are a few holes where you will have wedges in and you can be a little bit more aggressive.  Overall I think if you can hit fairways, greens, you're not going to be too far off.  I feel like that's what I did today.
 Q. The par-5 18th here looking much different than in years past.  What are your impressions of the island green?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   With the green being so firm, I mean, even if I were to have hybrid in or -- it's hard (indiscernible), and especially with pin being left today.  (Indiscernible) hit a fantastic shot.  Just carried between the water and the front edge there.
 I laid up with a pitching wedge and it was a little bit of a divot.  Just have a wedge in. I think it's a great hole, especially when the pins are back.  I feel like it's a really good hole from the back tee, too, because the tee shots are really demanding and the rough gets pretty thick around the fairway from the back tee.
 Q. Anna, you shot a bogey-free round today.  I would imagine on the course to start a major week has to have a good feeling for you.
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I was very happy with today obviously.  Felt like I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens, and when I did miss it was either in the first cut or on the fringe.
 So very solid.  Felt my putting was a little bit more solid than the last couple weeks.  A lot of good two-putts.  Just not really felt like I was in trouble anywhere.  Good bunker shot on hole No. 3, but other than that I felt like I left myself in some good positions.
 Some of the greens were really firm so you had to take a little bit longer putt.  Overall, I felt like it was very solid.
 Q. When you can capitalize and not have any three-putts, I would imagine that's pretty nice.  You had birdies at 2, 7, 12, and 14.  Any of those particularly stand out?
 ANNA NORDQVIST:   No.  I mean, I hit a good -- it was probably a 15-footer on 2.
 And then I hit a good shot in on 7.  It was probably maybe ten feet.
 And I hit a good shot in on 12 and 14.
 So, yeah, nothing major.  Just left myself in good position to make the putt.
