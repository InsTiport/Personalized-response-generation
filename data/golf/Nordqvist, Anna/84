 Q.   Any goals that you had coming into the Asian swing?   I know you were playing well beforehand.   Did you have anything you wanted to accomplish in the final stretch?   
ANNA NORDQUIST:   You kind of want to keep at it.   I've had a pretty good year so far, and it would be even better to end the golf season with a strong finish in Asia.   I mean, all these events are really good.   
Shanshan is coming off of a win, so she will be hard to beat.   I think overall I would like to have a good finish getting to see me in Florida, look back at the season and feel like I had a strong year from start to finish.   
   
 Q.   Race to the CME.   Have you been keeping an eye on it?   You're right there in the cusp.   I know you'll have a chance at winning the thing.   Anything you're hoping to get in there?  
ANNA NORDQUIST:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think all you can do all year is put yourself in a position to have a chance, going into the tournament in Naples.   You know, I haven't thought much about it, but obviously I'm working hard on my game to just try to peak at the right time.  
   
 Q.   Anything you are working on before coming to Asia in between the little break.   You had a pretty decent break, right?   
ANNA NORDQUIST:   I took three weeks off.   It was very refreshing.   I didn't touch my clubs for a week and a half.   I think it's the longest break I've had in over a year.   So it felt just nice to get a fresh mind coming to Malaysia where I started.   I worked a lot on my putting with my coach and hopefully that will pay off.   
   
 Q.   What did you do in the break?   Anything exciting?   Absolutely nothing exciting?   Rest a lot?  
ANNA NORDQUIST:   Yeah, I did rest a lot.   Watched The Ryder Cup.   Didn't move from the couch.   I went up to New York City for a couple of days.   I had an outing with Adidas and then just kind of hang out in the city for a couple of days.   It was fun, went to Central Park, did a little bit of shopping.   Went to Ground Zero.   Just never really got to explore the city until now, so I really enjoyed that.   Just being home for almost two weeks, the longest I've been home.   But it was raining a lot in Florida, so maybe it wasn't the best place to be.  
   
 Q.   What about the resort here?   Obviously first impression is pretty darn good?  
ANNA NORDQUIST:   We are so spoiled.   We show up here and we got here in the middle of the night.   Just waiting for the sun, and then open the windows and you are in paradise.   You can't wait to come back here next year.   Just trying to soak it all in.
