Q. Just some thoughts on today.
ANNA NORDQVIST: I feel like I played really solid.  The wind really kicked up and I was surprised how strong it was there the first -- especially from 4 and forward.
Just made it really hard.  A couple holes played really long.  (Indiscernible) I felt like we hit a lot of good shots; just really couldn't get the clubs (indiscernible).
Made some poor bogeys, 11, 12.  Had a good opportunity on 13; didn't make.  A little disappointed on not birdieing the last.  I hit a really good drive there but got a pretty shitty lie in the fairway.
Overall I feel like I played a little bit better than I scored.  I'm still in it.  It was just a hard afternoon with the wind.
Q. Kay said you were backing off a little bit more than yesterday.  Was that because of the conditions out there?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, I mean, it was more people around today.  I was really surprised that there was a lot of -- like the crowds were huge here.
Obviously appreciate their support, but it's a little bit more people walking around, so lost the focus a little bit there.
Definitely the wind was hard to judge and it was hard trusting it.
Q. Obviously you've been in this position before, near the top of the board.  What's the key to tomorrow?
ANNA NORDQVIST: Well, I think tomorrow you just got to go out there and stay aggressive.  I feel like I'm hitting the shots I need to hit.
Just a matter of making a few more putts.  Going to be same conditions for everyone tomorrow, and I think that benefits me.  I have nothing to lose tomorrow.  I obviously like this track, so I'm excited.
