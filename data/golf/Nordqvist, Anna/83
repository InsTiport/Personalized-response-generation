 Q.   A couple of very solid opening rounds.   You must be feeling good about your golf so far.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, it's been good.   I came into this week with really no expectations, just trying to have fun.   I have my little brother on the bag this week.   Just trying to enjoy Dubai as much as I can.  
Struggling a little bit with jet‑lag and I could feel it today.   I only got maybe two or three hours of sleep last night, just couldn't sleep.   But I'm happy trying to keep up with Shanshan.   She's playing really good golf and these are some of the best greens I've putted on all year, so I'm very happy to see the ball stay online when you hit a good putt.  
   
 Q.   How were conditions compared to yesterday?   Seemed breezy yesterday afternoon.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, definitely got breezy at the end there.   On 12 I had a pitching wedge to a back pin and yesterday I had a 7‑iron to the front.   
So it definitely played a little bit different and it felt like the ball was rolling a little bit smoother on the greens, too, because there wasn't as many pitch marks and people walking around the holes.   
Overall the course is in phenomenal shape and I'm just very happy I decided to come here this year.  
   
 Q.   You had a couple wins in the States in February and March.   What do you have to do to get the trophy in Dubai?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Well, you can make a lot of birdies out here if you hit good shots and get your putting going.   But you're definitely going to have to make birdies.   Going to try to stay aggressive these next two days and just enjoy myself and have fun with it.
