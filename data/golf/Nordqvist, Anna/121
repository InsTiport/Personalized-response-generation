 Q.   Take me through your round today and what was working well for you.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It was pretty solid in the beginning of the round.   Started on the back and I hit 11 in two, so quite an easy birdie there.   Then kept hitting good shots, kept missing in the right spots.   And then on the back nine hit a couple drives just off the fairway.   It makes it quite a bit tougher.   But I fought through it, and I had a couple good holes coming in and finished with a birdie, so very happy.   
   
 Q.   You take the clubhouse lead with 69.   How does that feel being the first major and just starting the week off on a good start?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I mean, it feels good.   Most of all, it just feels good that pieces of the puzzle are coming together and things I'm working on are paying off.   I'm very mostly happy about that, and then having a good score today obviously makes it even better.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel that this course suits your game in any way?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah.   This course always kind of suited my eyes.   I played Qâ€‘school here and played a couple years here on the Tour.   But it's so beautiful here, and it reminds me a lot of Phoenix where I went to school.   Good memories.
