Q.   Solid day out there.   What was working for you? 
ANNANORDQVIST:   I hit the ball really, really well today.   I gave myself a lot of good opportunities.   Hit quite a few close.   And I think I still had three or four lip‑outs and still shot 5‑under.   I'm very happy with the day and I felt good out there.

Q.   How has your time been in Korea?   I know you had some fun on Monday night, but what's it like here? 
ANNANORDQVIST:   I think it's good.   I'm just trying to enjoy golf right now. 
It's been a lot warmer these last couple of days than what I expected.   You know, it's been good.   You do your things on the golf course and then go have some dinners with some friends and just have a good time.

Q.   You have been on a couple of Solheim Cup teams.   We have International Crown coming up next year.   You all are right up there in it.   How excited are you for that?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It's going on the fun.   Obviously having another team event, me and Caroline Hedwall seem to be a pretty good fit in the Solheim.   So I can't wait to play with her.

Q.   It's a been a while since you've made your way to the winner's circle.   Do you think about that at all or do you just block it out and stick to your routine?
ANNANORDQVIST:   Yeah, absolutely.   I would definitely like to win again.   That's why we're out here.   I feel like I put myself in a couple of good positions.   I haven't really posted out.
All I can do is try to get better each day.   And right now that's what I'm trying to focus on.   Everything else will happen.

Q.   With only two rounds left, what is your mindset? 
ANNANORDQVIST:   I felt pretty good out there today.   I know what I should try to focus on.   It's just a matter of keeping it going.
