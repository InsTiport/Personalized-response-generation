  Q. You guys fought until the very end. Did you guys think you could pull this thing off on the 18th green?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Absolutely. We had a good birdie try. That's what mattered. Michelle and Cristie, they played great. It was a great win for them. But I think we hung in there. It came down to 18, but I guess congratulations to them.  
  
  Q. Your chip shot on 18, can you tell me about that? It looks like it was a pretty nasty lie down in there. You hit a beautiful shot.   
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yes, it was really good. It was tucked in there, in the edge, and it rolled out a little bit more than I expected, but it was great.  
  
  Q. The Europeans came back this afternoon and really fought well and put some numbers on the board. Are you pleased about that?  
 ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, we're right in there, so 12 singles tomorrow, and we're excited, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
