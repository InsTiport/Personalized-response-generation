 Q.   After a solid third round, heading into the final round, would you take us through your round a little bit?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I started off really solid.   I hit it close on 2, 3,4, 5, made birdies there, had a good shot on 6, hit it close on 7, missed, made birdie, 8.   So I got off to a really good start.   I think the back nine is playing a little tougher but I hang tough and made a silly mistake on 16 but other than that, I'm really happy with my round.   
   
 Q.   It was a solid round and you put yourself into a great position heading into the final round.   Can you take us through what your mind‑set will be tonight heading into tomorrow morning?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, all you can do is put yourself in a position, hopefully they won't run away too much the last couple holes.   I feel like my game is sharpening up and we have a major next week so I'm very excited.  
   
 Q.   You've made some changes in the last seven, eight months.   Has one change stood out over another?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, I think it's a combination.   I started working with my caddie in mid July last year, Jason Gilroyed, and we make a really good team and he kept me in a good mood on the course.   Changed my equipment, changed my clothes, changed my coach; so there's a lot of things going on, but I feel like it's still a work‑in‑progress but every day is getting better.  
   
 Q.   How do you keep from getting overwhelmed with all of those changes?   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I think at times, these last couple weeks, I try to keep myself in pace and my coach has been really good.   They always check in with me and make sure I'm on track.   But there's days where I'm hitting better, when I'm doing what I'm supposed to and there's days where I'm going back to the old stuff but today was definitely one of the days going in the right direction so I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   After your win in Thailand, you talked about the tremendous support of your family and friends, can you talk a little with what they mean to you and how they affect your game.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, for me, it's all about being happy.   I feel like the last couple months have been much happier and I've been in a good place thanks to my friends and thanks to my family, and I'm fortunate to have people around me that supports me in the daily grind.   It's not easy but I'm really happy, they cheer me up and my older brother's kids they make me style every day so I have a lot to smile for and I'm very fortunate to be here with them.   
   
 Q.   And after the conclusion of this tournament, the International Crown teams will be set.   Can you talk about what it's like playing for your team, representing your country, and playing alongside with some other women representing your country?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I'm very happy, I'm very excited.   I played a lot with Pernilla and Caroline growing up and we played a lot of team events.   Solheim Cup is always going to be different but I'm excited for a new format.   I think it's going to be new for everyone and it's going to be a little hit and miss or it's going to be‑‑ you can go for it, and I think that's what makes it really exciting.
