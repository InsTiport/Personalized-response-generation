  Q. Anna, it's been a long time coming.   Your third win on the LPGA, but you played well so in this final round. 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I mean, it's been a while, but I'm just so happy to finally break through again.   Michelle played great; Inbee kept pushing me at the end.   I just really had to stay strong.   Had a rough first couple holes, but kept playing good on the back.
Just unbelievable to get that win again. 

Q.   Good on the back?   You were 5â€‘under par on the back nine.   What is an explosive start.
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I think definitely the putt on 10 definitely gave me some momentum, and then, you know, just tried to keep making birdies to keep up with Inbee.

Q.   Well, it was a tremendous win.   You must be so pleased, especially to win here in Thailand.
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, absolutely.   I've been working so hard all winter.   These last couple years I have had a lot of great people by my side that never left my side and kept supporting me through the good times and the bad times.   I will always be thankful for them. 
I'm just so excited to get a win here, and look forward to the rest of the year.
