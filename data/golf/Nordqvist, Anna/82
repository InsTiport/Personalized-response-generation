Q.   All day played very solid.   What happened on the 17th? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, I mean, I hit the ball really well.   Like just couldn't make any putts.   17 I hit a perfect shot, you know, exactly how I wanted to hit it before the pin.   So I wasn't too happy.
Just can't be over the green there.   Had a good chip shot to four, five feet and slam the first putt by and make a double bogey there.   So I wasn't too happy with our game plan there, but I hit good shots and that's all I can do.

Q.   You have to be overall happy with the round.   You played very well.   You looked very mentally on it. 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I played really well.   I had 16 greens and had a lot of great‑‑ gave myself a lot of good chances.   Just couldn't make any putts.

Q.   Game plan going into tomorrow?   Couple shots back, but... 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, unfortunately lost a couple at the end, but, you know, just got a put a low one out there tomorrow.
