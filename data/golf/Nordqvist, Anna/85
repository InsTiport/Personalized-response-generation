Q.   Great round today, especially with So Yeon.   Did you feel a little extra pressure seeing how low she was going to keep up with her? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   No, well, I was trying to keep up with her on the greens.   I played really well today too, and just couldn't seem to make any putts.   I burned six or seven edges today, so it's a bit frustrating, but she played really well, and I tried to feed off her.   I don't think she's made a bogey in two days, and I think I made one.   So it's been really good golf in the group, and we had a lot of fun.

Q.   You've played well all year, pretty consistent.   How's the level of your confidence right now? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   My confidence is great.   I played great last week, just couldn't seem to make a lot of putts last week.   Yesterday was great, off the block and shoot 7â€‘under the first day, and then today I felt my game was even better than yesterday.   It's funny how a day can turn around. 
But I'm obviously very happy with what I've been doing, and I felt I would struggle a little bit after the U.S. Open in Arkansas and the British Open, but I feel like I'm back on track and I'm happy with the way I'm hitting it.

Q.   Do you have to match these two days?   Do you think the way the scoring is going, do you have to match it? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, you have a lot of birdie opportunities.   I don't know how many I gave myself today within ten foot, so you're definitely going to have to make a lot of birdies.   Hopefully, the greens firm up a little bit.   It makes it a little tougher, but it's definitely going to be a (Indiscernible), and I expect there to be some low scores this afternoon.

Q.   I saw you on the range the other day.   When did you pick up the orange ball? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I've been using it since I would say April, May.   It's one of my drills that I do with my coach.

Q.   What is the theory? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I'm working a lot on connection in my swing, and it's one of the drills I do.

Q.   Have you noticed it working? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I'm hitting very solid, and generally it's 16, 17 greens.   Yesterday I had 16, so it's definitely paying off, and ball striking is one of my strongest parts, so I'm very happy with the way I'm hitting it.   I'll just keep working on my drills and I'll be right there.
