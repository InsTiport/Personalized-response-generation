 Q. How was it out there today?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: It was rough. The wind was blowing pretty hard and it was hard to control the shots in the wind. It was different wind today from other days. You just had to adjust a little bit. But I thought we did a really good job, and finished with three birdies in the last five, get some good momentum. I'm happy with the week.   
   
 Q. How do you find links golf as an experience? Sometimes it can be quite frustrating.   
ANNA NORDQVIST: Yeah, definitely, I feel like I hit some good drives or tee shots this week and they ended up in bunkers and just got to pitch it out. But it's fun. It's creative. We only play it once a year. I think we all would get a little more greyer if we did play it more than once a year.  
It's fun. Turnberry is such a great course. I never played it until I came here this week. It's been a treat playing it and I can't wait for the British Open next year.  
   
 Q. One of the positives, the amount of Europeans doing so well and the Americans that aren't doing so well. Looks good for the Solheim Cup.   
ANNA NORDQVIST: Absolutely. I think it's only two more events before they are going to pick the team. Happy to see so many Europeans playing well and some of the girls that usually plays on The European Tour doing well, as well. So it's great to see. I think we are going to have a chance this year.
