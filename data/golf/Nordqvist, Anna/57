 Q.  Overall, your thoughts on the week, thoughts on the final round?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: Played so well this week.  Finishing with double was obviously not what I planned.  But I was in-between clubs on the last hole and it was kind of gusting out and we were going back and forth.  Pretty poor decision there.  Obviously disappointed with that.   
But played really well.  Had it going.  Hit a good putt on 12, 14, 15 and a really good one on 17 that didn't go in.  I felt like I did everything I could, but I didn't feel like I deserved to double the last.  But it is what it is now.   
My game is in good shape, but it's just been a little bit of a year where things hasn't really been going my way.  Last night I was playing flawless, hit a sprinkler in the middle of my lay up, and I got into the bank of the hazard.  I did so many good things, so it's about to pay off, I hope.  Proud of myself this week.  I did a lot of good things, but I'm just a little disappointed with the finish.
