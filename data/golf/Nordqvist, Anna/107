Q.   First European win on home soil or on U.S. soil.   How does it feel?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   It feels unbelievable.   We had such an incredible week and it's such a great team.
So I feel like it couldn't happen at a better time.

Q.   What do you think was the biggest motivation for you guys?   Was it keeping the cup, was it beating Americans on home soil, or was it something else?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I got to go, sorry.
