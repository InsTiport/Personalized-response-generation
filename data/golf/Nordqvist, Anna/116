  ANNA NORDQVIST:   The fact that we are playing.   The staff has done a tremendous job just getting us playing even though it was 12 holes, and the more holes you can play, the happier you are.   So I just felt like I had to go out with a birdie mentality today not knowing how many holes we are going to play this week. 
But I gave myself a lot of chances, and it felt pretty good out there, so I'm really happy with the 5‑under today. 

Q.   Just talk about your mentality going into a tournament round where you're not playing 18 holes.   Is there anything that was different for you this morning before you went out?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   You know, I was happy like, okay, I teed off at 9:30 and expect to be done by 1 and then lay by the beach or relax all afternoon, but then it turned out we played five holes and then had the three‑hour delay.   But you know, you just gotta make the best out of it.   It's the same for everyone, and I think we all agree that we're just happy to be playing.

Q.   You mentioned on Golf Channel obviously the 61 was nice last week in Mobile.   What's working so well for you in your game that you're able to go so low right now?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I feel like my game's been improving and improving all year.   I just haven't got any putts to drop really. 
Last week I had a couple easy birdies and made a couple ten footers and golf just seemed very easy that day.
