Q. Anna and Caroline, you guys got it done again this morning as the first group off.  Just talk about how you were able to play this morning and get another win.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, we just played really solid.  It was great.  Sorry.  I mean, we never gave anything away, to be honest.  We never made a bogey and conditions were tough out there.
It was just nice to get that win and to finish early today so we can get some rest for the afternoon.
Q. And you mentioned that you're going to have to go back out again this afternoon.  Anna, what's that like for and you?  How good does it feel to be able to end it quicker this morning so you can have a little bit more time to rest?
ANNA NORDQVIST: It was definitely motivation out there because it was miserable at times; not pretty at all.  It was tough, and I feel like when I was a little bit off Caroline was strong.  She didn't have many bad holes, but then I'd try to cover for her.
It was a great best ball, and I think we're happy to be inside.  It got really cold there at the end and really wet.  Looking forward to the afternoon, but right now we're enjoying inside.
Q. You guys remain unbeaten as a team at the UL International Crown.  How confident are you guys as a pairing together?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I think we just enjoy playing together.  I'm looking forward to the afternoon as well.  Just trying to make as many birdies and not give away any holes.
So I'm just enjoying it a lot.
Q. How has the course played differently today just with the weather?
ANNA NORDQVIST: I found the ball wasn't flying anywhere.  I thought I hit a great 3-wood on 12; went 160 yards.  So just, I mean, the wind is strong.  It's cold.  Hasn't been any roll all week so the course is playing long as is, but with the conditions it's playing even tougher.  Definitely a tough track.
