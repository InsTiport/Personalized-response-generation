 Q.  How special does this feel right now?  
ANNA NORDQVIST: It feels really special, because I've been playing pretty good all spring.  I just haven't really got any results, and it just really got frustrating there for awhile.   
My caddie just told me to stay patient and so did the rest of my team, because they knew how well I was playing, getting really zero out of it.   
Sometimes the longer you have to wait and the more patient you have to stay, but the sweeter it feels when it finally pays off.
