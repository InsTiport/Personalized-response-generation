 Q.   You won 3 & 2.   Can you talk a little bit about the match.   
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, it was a good day.   I gave one away in the beginning, but after that I started to hit it really solid.   I made a birdie on 8.   I think we made the turn at even, and then I made a couple birdies on the back and played really solid.   
   
 Q.   Kind of felt the momentum at the turn there?  
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I've been playing pretty solid all week, so I've been very happy with that.   It felt like I was pushing her and putting pressure on her, exactly what my plan was.   And at the end, I felt like it was tougher.   And very obviously, I'm very happy to be undefeated this week.
