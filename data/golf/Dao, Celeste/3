CELESTE DAO: Yes, very much.   
 Q.  How did you close this out?

 Q.  So you made birdie?  
CELESTE DAO: Yes.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you have some momentum going into the next round?  
CELESTE DAO: Oh, yes, I'm very confident from my putting.  It really went well on the back nine, so I'm excited to start another match.
