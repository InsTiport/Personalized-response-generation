CELESTE DAO: It very went well all the round.  My putting was really the key of my game today.
Q. The putting was good; did you have a lot of birdies?
CELESTE DAO: Yes, I had a lot of birdies and bogeys.  That's why on the front I didn't take a big lead, but on the back, the birdies came --
Q. More often?
CELESTE DAO: In a row, so that's how I --
Q. How many did you have in a row?
CELESTE DAO: I had two in a row on the back, and after on the front was like one birdie, bogey, par, birdie.
Q. So it was kind of up and down, up and down?
CELESTE DAO: Yes.
Q. When you got those two consecutive birdies, what holes were those?
CELESTE DAO: It was 12 and 13.
Q. And about how long were the putts?
CELESTE DAO: 12 I was on the fringe.  I had like 18 feet.  I thought because my ball was on the fringe, I couldn't clean it.  It had like some dirt on it, so I wasn't sure how it went, but I stroked it very well, and it went in.  That gave me the momentum.  On the 13th I hit it to like seven feet and birdied it.
Q. You must have a little more confidence, even more, going into tomorrow's round.  What are your thoughts right now?
CELESTE DAO: Still do the same thing as today.  Do the same thing.
Q. Were the conditions any different on the golf course from this morning to this afternoon?
CELESTE DAO: This morning was more wet, I think, because it rained, and this afternoon was more hotter, so I could like -- but it was similar.  It was similar.
Q. And you're happy?
CELESTE DAO: Yes, very happy.
