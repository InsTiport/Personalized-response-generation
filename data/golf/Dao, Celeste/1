 Q.  How did your experience go out there?  
CELESTE DAO: I'm really happy about being here. I think I'm really grateful I had a spot this week.   
I'm pretty upset about my performance, but also grind it out for the next tournaments.   
 Q.  But the experience...  
CELESTE DAO: Oh, yes, it's been great. The tournament has host us like incredibly well. The course is magnificent.   
It shows the real pro golf out here.   
 Q.  Was this your first...  
CELESTE DAO: It's my second Canadian Open.   
 Q.  Did you play last year as well?  
CELESTE DAO: Yes.   
 Q.  That was at Regina.  
CELESTE DAO: Yes.   
 Q.  I didn't get to Regina last year. Now that you have this tournament finished, what's ahead for you?  
CELESTE DAO: I have my first NCAA tournament next week. I'll have my qualifiers. I'm in Georgia, so I'll play this year for the whole year.   
 Q.  So I guess you long ago accepted to go to Georgia.  
CELESTE DAO: Yeah, I think three years I've been verbally committed, and a week I'm in school already.   
 Q.  So you have to go catch up then.  
CELESTE DAO: Yes, yeah.   
 Q.  And what about the golf at Georgia?  
CELESTE DAO: Yes. We have a strong team. Last year the team didn't do so well because like their really good players all turned pro. So we have a lot of new freshmen and they're really strong, a lot from Europe and Asia and Canada. I'm excited to play.   
 Q.  Any other Canadians there?  
CELESTE DAO: No, I'm the only one.   
 Q.  Why did you choose Georgia?  
CELESTE DAO: The coach, really good coach. He makes me think a lot of my coach from Team Canada. His name in Georgia is Josh Brewer. Also the facilities are amazing, the school, so...   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
CELESTE DAO: Yes. I think it's going to help my game to be even more better when I turn pro.
