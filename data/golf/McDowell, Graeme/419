 Q. Nicely done, was there a whole lot of offense you could play out there today or were you playing defense with the wind? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: We started off on the back nine this morning. Early on it was cold, it was breezy --

 Q. It was dark?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It was dark and cold and felt a bit like home really. No. 7 and No. 11 were particularly difficult holes. I got off to a slow start, bogeyed 10. Made some nice putts and hung in there on the back nine. 
 The front nine kind of offers up a few chances, but this wind was tough today. It was very hard to pick at times, a lot of across. It was all about ball flight. You had to really shape it around. It was a tough test. 

 Q. Sounds like fun, though. You had to think your way around, you couldn't just connect the dots. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: For sure. It's certainly not Florida golf, Orlando, something a little bit more maybe back home, like I say, European-style stuff. The course in great shape. The rough is not as thick as years gone by. I think if we had thick rough out there, it would be an unbelievably difficult test. But the greens are running good and like I say, the course offers up a few chances but it's got some teeth out there, as well. 

 Q. How were the greens? The bermudagrass had not really had a chance to get going. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: There's still a bit of grain out there. I realize obviously bermuda is not growing like it can with a bit of heat and a bit of moisture. I live up in Orlando and it's been a cold winter here and the greens have been suffering a little bit.

 Q. Happy with a 68? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm very happy, if you'd offered me if I walked off the 11th green today, my second hole, I would have snatched it.
