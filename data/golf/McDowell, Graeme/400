   GRAEME McDOWELL: The greens were quite tricky. Birdies were hard to come by. Golf course was there for the taking a little bit. You are not going to get an easier day around this place. Some of the pins were on tough little slopes. 
 I played well for about ten or 11 holes, and had a real sloppy 3-putt on the 11th, and just kind of stopped my momentum. I was starting to get into a bit of a groove at that point and hit an average chip and my ball -- my putt on 11 just bumped left going up to the hole and I got a horrible bobble on my next putt. Walked off with a double there and couldn't recover.
 Played solid enough. Hit a few wayward tee shots coming in, but not disastrous. Not played myself out of the golf tournament.

 Q. Do you feel there is a really low score out there if you can get everything going?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, for sure. I said someone would go super low this week, but you can defend this golf course by hiding the pins away because the greens are very undulating and very sloping. The place is in wonderful shape out there the place is in good shape though. 
 What way wonderful day out there. 3 got exactly what they deserved. They got a nice, sunshine day out in Killarney. It was beautiful so it was a pleasure day out there today.

 Q. What part of your game really needs to improve tomorrow?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I just need to sharpen up across the board, hit more fairways, and my iron play was solid enough. I just really need to putt better tomorrow. 

 Q. How was it playing with Damien today? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: He played lovely. Did all of the right things off the tee, drove it well, hit some nice shots and scrambled when he had to. He's a solid player, Damien, he's in good form right now coming off a good finish last week, so good to see him playing well.
