 Q.   Nice way to finish?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, left a sour test, not parred the last there.   I kind of hit it tee‑to‑green, a whole lot better than I played the last two days.   I played very solidly.   You know, the greens, had a little trouble with them this afternoon, with the rains this morning, they were quite soft and they didn't roll as pure as maybe they would sort of first thing in the morning.   
I didn't putt great yesterday morning, either.   I struggled on the greens a bit this afternoon, but all in all, great ball‑striking round, get back out there in the morning, the greens should be nice and smooth and we'll get back after it.   Taking nothing away from the fact that we got a great end of the draw this afternoon, there's no doubt about that.   You know, the greens were a small issue, nothing major at all.   We were very fortunate I think.   
   
 Q.   63,64, does it look like a very tough number to shoot out there?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It's a funny course.   It's a funny course.   If you play well, you can take it apart.   If you play badly, it's not very forgiving.   The rough is thick.   If you drive it in the fairways, you get a lot of short irons in your hands, so with very receptive greens, you can play well.   
But like I say, if you start missing, that's very penal.   The rough is it thick and swallows up your ball, and tough to clean up those 6‑ and 8‑footers this afternoon, a little squirrely with a little traffic.   But there's a low score out there.   I played well enough this afternoon to shoot a low one, but just couldn't get the ball to the hole.   
   
 Q.   Not a million miles away‑‑  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   You feel like you're out of the tournament and then you look at the computer and you're in the Top‑25.   I need a 65 to give myself a sniff on Sunday.   65 puts me right back in the tournament tomorrow morning, and that's all you can ask for really.   Scoring has been hot from the leaders, and they are going to be tough to catch.   But I feel like I'm driving it well enough, my iron play is good enough.   I just need to get my eye on the greens and I'll be there or thereabouts come Sunday.   
   
 Q.   What's the longest putt you've holed in two days?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   The longest putt I've holed in two days was the putt on the 10th green, which was my first hole yesterday morning.   Hit it out of position, hit a bad wedge in there to about 40 feet and made it, and thought, oh, here we go.   And haven't made one since.   Bizarre old game.   
The greens are tough, because they are certainly more undulating than they look.   You don't leave yourself a lot of straight putts.   You leave yourself a lot of breaking putts, and you have to match line with speed all the time.   It's tough to make a bunch.   So hopefully I'm saving them.
