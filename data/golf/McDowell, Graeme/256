Q.   Did you realize that they were going to probably pull you off the golf course and keep you off the golf course for the rest of the evening?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   You know, we could certainly see it coming, but I guess you never know the extent of the storm, and when we get in and start jumping on iPhones and start looking at radars, it was fairly easy to see that there wasn't going to be a lot of golf left today.   Disappointing.   We've done well this week to avoid the storms that are pretty inevitable in this part of the country this time of the year.   The PGA have done a good job of keeping things moving. 
But it looks like we'll have an early start in the morning, and we're going to have three balls off two tees in the afternoon and try and get done tomorrow.

Q.   You're 2‑under par on 12 fairway.   What's the most difficult shot to hit first thing out of the box? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   You know, I think that stretch of holes, probably 10 through 14 is probably the toughest stretch on the golf course.   So we're definitely right in the middle of that.   I'm in the 12th fairway.   I've already hit my tee shot.   I'm in the left rough, in fact.   It's definitely, for the later starting off it's a tough stretch of holes, it really just depends what this wind does in the morning.   It was a great test of golf out there this afternoon, a nice 50‑mile‑an‑hour breeze keeping everyone honest, and we'll see how conditions are in the morning. 

Q.   Are you looking forward to tomorrow?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   I got ready today, was feeling up for it, and it's wide open.   What's the lead, 6?   You know, I could have been a couple better today.   I made a mess of No.7, but apart from that I played lovely, left a couple putts out there, and right where I want to be.   Decent shape and on 12, just got to come out guns blazing in the morning, try and finish 3‑ or 4‑under par.
