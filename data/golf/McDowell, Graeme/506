Q.
Obviously disappointed?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  I just fell victim to the momentum of match play.  There was about a six  or seven hole run there, and I just felt like everything I did just wasn't really good enough.

I hung in there well.  I had a really good putt on the last, and I thought I made it.
Q.  How about the experience of this week?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  It's a great experience.  I'd love to do it again.  Obviously it's tough.  It's the first time I've played match play in a few years, so I'll learn from experience and move on.

I'm not disappointed in the way I'm playing.  I'm playing great golf.
Q.  Is yesterday going to be something you'll hold on to for a while?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  Just to come out here and win a game against some of the best players in the world, that's something I'll hold onto, no doubt about it, to be down but not beaten today and having hung in there and played the match until the last and give myself a chance at it.
Q.  When are you going to play in the U.S. again?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  I'm playing the Honda.  I have a few starts out here this year, so I'll be back.
