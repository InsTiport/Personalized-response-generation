Q. How was it out there?
GRAEME McDOWELL: A bit disappointing.  First missed cut of the year and I have to wait until I come to the Irish Open to do it, but it's always disappointing to miss the weekend here, especially here at a great golf course like Lahinch.  But I struggled to hit the fairways, even though I felt like I drove it okay.  The fairways are pretty elusive, which made iron play very difficult, and I really couldn't get anything going on the greens, either.  So it was really just a combination of doing things averagely.  It wasn't like I did anything terribly both days, but yeah, it was frustrating.  I couldn't seem to kick-start anything.  Sort of No. 4 this morning really summed -- my fourth hole of the day really summed up the week.  I tried to take that tee shot on, hit a really great drive down the right-hand side, walk up, it's unplayable in the side of the bunker and make 5 there, so that derailed my start, and it was battles from there.
Q. Nice to see you smiling, though, by 16 with the crowd.
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, listen, I really enjoyed the atmosphere out there the last two days.  I think 10 years ago that was the kind of thing that I would have had my head down for two days, but I think I've realised that these are to be enjoyed.  A lot of fun always to come back to this part of the world and play in front of the home fans.  The weather has been beautiful.  Golf course is fantastic.  I really enjoyed my couple days.  Disappointed obviously not to be in the mix going into the weekend, but I've got a little bit of work to do on my game the next few days and we'll get ready for Scotland.
Q. Are you excited about the next couple of weeks?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah.  This wasn't the start I was looking for for this three-week swing, but it just takes one big week, right?  That's the great thing about this sport, you've always got next week.  The game doesn't feel miles away.  I'll get a bit of work done the next couple of days and go to Queenwood on Monday and then we'll head up to Renaissance and see what they have in store for us the next week in Scotland.
Big congrats to everyone involved this week, Paul McGinley and everyone involved here at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open.  They've done a great job, spectacular tournament again, and good to see the Irish Open continuing to go from strength to strength.
