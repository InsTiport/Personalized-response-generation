   GRAEME McDOWELL: Obviously not what I had in mind for my title defence this week. Played a little better today but I just didn't have it on the greens the last two days. I didn't hit the ball terribly badly; did the damage yesterday. Made nothing on the greens. 

 Q. Surprises you? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It does surprise me. I liked these it greens last year. Putted well on them. They are a little slow this year. The greens staff have had to keep the grass a little longer on them obviously due to the forecast of high winds. I struggled with the speed of them, and didn't get a putt to the hole barely in two days.
 I don't know. Just wasn't quite the week I had in mind. I was hoping to be here obviously Monday. I feel a little underprepared losing that day on Monday. Didn't hit a golf ball between basically leaving Orlando on Friday and Tuesday here. Wasn't as prepared as I would like to be, and showed in my game.

 Q. What's next? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Back home next week for a week in Ireland, and out to TPC hopefully. Obviously I have to be Top-50 in the world by Monday so I've done myself no favours. Fingers crossed. Not the end of the world. If TPC doesn't happen, I'll probably play Italy. So one or the other.
