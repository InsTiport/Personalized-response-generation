   GRAEME McDOWELL:  Disappointing weekend. Didn't swing it great, didn't feel great energy wise. The jet lag caught up with me a little. It is tough to stay upbeat for 72 holes. As good as I felt Friday, I felt very flat yesterday and today. Maybe it is the result of playing five in a row. I am looking forward to my week off next week.    
 I feel I have learned a lot about myself this week. Certainly things I can work on with my short game and physical stamina. What these weeks are all about is that these are marathons. You have to pace yourself. They are unbelievably tough weeks. My long game, I have some positives the way I played this week tee to green, the way I have putted and the way I hung in there Thursday and Friday and conducted myself on the golf course. Glad it is over, though.
