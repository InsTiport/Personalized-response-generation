Q.   You've beaten Stephen Gallacher to top your group; what do you have to say about that match from your point of view? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, good game.   I got off to a fast start, played beautiful the first eight holes and kind of started getting in a little trouble which you can do around this golf course.   I hit two bad tee shots and all of a sudden Stephen wins three on the spin and it's back to grinding again. 
Stephen returned the favour with a couple bad tee shots of his own coming in and thankfully made my job a little easier.   It's a tough one.   He's out there fighting for his life; a halve match will do me, but you know you want to put the game away.   These group stages can be kind of a little bit banana skins and you sort of knuckle down and get through and get into the real stuff this weekend.

Q.   You're renowned for your driving ability, putting the ball in play, is this course intimidating even for you off the tee?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   There's a few tight tee shots but it really suits my ball shape; it suits the fade.   You can aim away from trouble. 
And then on the way in, the fairways are tilted so much from right‑to‑left you actually want to hit a cut against them.   It suits my ball flight I have to say, it's my kind of golf course. 
Hopefully I can keep doing what I'm doing and give myself a chance this weekend.

Q.   Winning 5 & 3, 4 & 2, how valuable are big wins in a long week?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, you certainly want to conserve energy.   You want to get into the weekend first and foremost and you want to be conserving energy.   This golf course is reasonably demanding physically but we are getting lots of cart rides out there.   Would be unwalkable normally. 
Through 36 holes the next two days if you want to go all the way, and you have to certainly conserve energy.   I'll sleep good tonight and hopefully be ready for a big day tomorrow.
