 Q. How do you feel about that today?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Damage was done yesterday, and it was just about trying to go out there and repair some of the damage today. I played quite nicely today. Struck the ball well. Disappointing finish there. I bogeyed; hit it in the water left on 15 and made bogey, and just a bit of a three whack on the last there, but generally hit the ball good today. Like I say, yesterday was my golf tournament done.

 Q. By the way you played today, you're not too disturbed? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Listen. I'm not disturbed about my game in any shape or form. Game is in good shape. It's firing on all cylinders. 
 Yes, I have work to do between now and Congressional. Yesterday was just a bit of an anomaly, just lost the feel in my swing a little bit. But tough conditions out there today, and sort of windy and wet early on, and I hit some nice shots.

 Q. You played the troublesome holes well, 2 and 14; you did okay on those. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I did. 

 Q. So nothing to be alarmed with?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: No, I'm not alarmed. Are you alarmed? 

 Q. What's the plan now?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm heading back to Portrush for three days just to put the feet up and chill and relax and recharge the batteries, and then I'm out to Orlando Thursday, weekend's practise and up to Congressional probably Sunday night. That's the tentative schedule, and I'm looking forward to a week, half a week recharging and half a week getting ready.

 Q. What do you expect of Congressional; going to be tough?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it's going to be tough. I saw the golf course a few weeks back. It looked very long and demanding that day, but hopefully it's firmed up a little bit and I'm sure the rough has got a little heavier since I was there. I'm looking forward to it. It should be a great week and looking forward to defending of course.
