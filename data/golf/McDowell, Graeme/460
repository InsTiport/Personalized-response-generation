  Q. What do they do to a course like this?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Obviously they are looking at The Ryder Cup in 2014. I don't like what they have done on 9. I think they wasted a good hole there. They put the tee 20 yards too far back but the prevailing wind is usually down there. The golf course is under water, so we can't be too critical. The golf course is under water. They have had their year's rainfall I think already to this point. Obviously this has been a horrible month for the rain.   
  
  Q. In the morning you would think the greens would be the best.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Even four or five groups in, they are spiked and heeled up -- spike is the wrong word. They are heel prints. They are just so, so soft. I think they could have made it a little slower for us so we could hit it harder and take the heel prints out of play, but they are a little too quick nearly.
