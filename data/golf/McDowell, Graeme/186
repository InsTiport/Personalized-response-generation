  GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, great scoring conditions today.   Hardly a breath of wind.   Very receptive greens, very pure putting surfaces.   I mean, everything kind of adds up to exactly what you're seeing on the leaderboard, which is a score‑fest. 
Bizarrely, I really haven't got it going on the greens yet this week.   I made a couple today, a bit of a bonus with the bunker shot on 16.   I haven't holed a lot of putts, though, so hopefully I'm saving it for tomorrow. 
Dustin, obviously great frontrunner, doing what he needed to do today.   Just nice to be in contention going into tomorrow.   I know conditions are going to be fairly similar again tomorrow and I'll have to go low to even finish second here. 

Q.   And 16 was pretty special, because that has catapulted you right up there?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, 16 was nice.   I went for that green every day, got very fortunate there yesterday.   Hit it in the trap today, which was a decent play to that pin, and you know, I hit a good trap shot, but it went in, so was a little fortunate and very nice. 
Two putts on the last two holes, which could have went in, but you know, that's golf, and really had a lot of fun today.   I hit the ball really well today.   Looking forward to tomorrow. 

Q.   Is it a little galling when you've shot a terrific low score and you find you've made no impact really on the leaders? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I knew it was going to be low scoring today.   We got off to a nice start, I said to Kenny, we've just got to keep the pedal down here, everyone is going to be going low.
Like I say, Dustin is doing what he needed to do; Martin Kaymer shooting 10‑under, Ian shooting 8‑ or 9‑under in front of me.   Golf course is set up for scoring and it is what it is.   It's a WGC event and these guys are pretty good.   Nice to be kind of mixing it up with them. 

Q.   Same again tomorrow?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Hope so.   Anything in that general vicinity tomorrow, I'm not going to say, might have a shot.   From here it looks like Dustin is going to have to beat himself for anybody to have a chance to watch him.   Race to Dubai points will be very important to me; I have a lot to play for tomorrow.   If not the trophy, second place will certainly be worth my while tomorrow.
