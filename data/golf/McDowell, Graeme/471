  Q. A 74, what's your feeling on just the whole experience of the day?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I can't really play a lot worse than that. That's probably my worst tee-to-green performance in the last 12 months without a doubt. Just struggled. Been working on my ball-striking a little bit this week, hitting right, hitting it left. Hit a lot of shots out there just didn't know where they were copping.  
  
  Q. You said yesterday you had the feeling that something was awry?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I haven't hit it good the last two days in practise, so it's a little bit of work-in-progress, yeah, after a couple weeks off, I feel like I've had a month off and someone stole my clubs in that month.   
 It's like competitive play, sometimes you just kind of lose the feel a little bit for what the ball flight is doing and that's kind of where I'm at right now. I need to play my way back into a little bit of form. It doesn't feel far away, but there's something just a little bit awry, so I'll just keep working it out.  
  
  Q. How bad was the rough on 5 on the left-hand side?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, the rough is very bad. At least last year it was thick and you got a lob-wedge and you chipped it out.  
 This year it's short enough to where it beats you into trying something. I just tried to dig rescue out of it, that was probably my only major mistake sort of course management-wise today.   
 Rest of the mistakes came off bad swings, apart from the double. I really scrambled well today. I was happy that I was able to hang in there with the wedges and the putter a little bit. Obviously disappointed with my ball-striking in general. Hopefully get some work done this afternoon and come out tomorrow.   
  
  Q. From past experience, do you find that it actually turns around quicker?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Like I say, it's playing my way back into a bit of form. I just need to get a few rounds under my belt this weekend and I'm by no means out of the tournament. 3- or 4-under par tomorrow, I'm back in it. I don't think this golf course is going to allow the guys to shoot 6-under every day. It's a tough track; you start missing fairways, there's a lot of bogeys.  
 Like I said, 3- or 4-under tomorrow, I'm right back in the tournament. Just a bit of work to do this afternoon.  
 One left on 18, tiny least. It was like a lot of my clubs and I haven't seen them in a month.   
  
  Q. Were the misses blocks?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Blocks and shape, nice combo.
