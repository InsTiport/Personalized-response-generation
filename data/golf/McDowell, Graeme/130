 Q.  Given the responsibility of going out first, describe how that feels.  GRAME McDOWELL: I just got off to such a slow start.  I really felt like I hadn't had enough course time this week, hadn't seen the ball go in the hole enough. I got off to a slow start against a hell of a player.  I dug in and he missed a putt on 8, on 7, to go 4-up, which was massive. Then we halved 8 and 9 on birdies.  I just felt something inside me start to turn around.  I was proud of myself coming down that back nine. Jordan made some mistakes; he'll be disappointed. The captain put a big role on me this morning and I'm happy I could deliver.   Q.  Describe this atmosphere.  GRAME McDOWELL: This is what we play for, this is what we practise for.  It's easy to forget that sometimes.  You want it so bad that you get in your own way sometimes.  You have to remind yourself that this is it.  This is what it's all about. We talked about it last night.  If you are 3-down, just try and win the next hole.  Get the crowd on your side.  Doesn't matter what you are doing out there, just try to extend the match, extend the match, extend the match, and thankfully that was enough at the end.
