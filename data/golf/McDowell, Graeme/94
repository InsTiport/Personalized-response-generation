GRAEME McDOWELL: I played beautiful all day.  Putting was difficult today.  A lot of the greens were quite exposed, and I left a lot of putts out there today.   
I missed the 9th fairway and missed a short one for par there, and hit a bad tee shot on 16 and got out of position, and three-putted from long range for bogey there.   
The last two holes were just very disappointing.  I hit a decent 4-iron to 17, and had a good trap shot and missed it.  And 3-wood with the last.   
It was just a round of what could have been, because I played the golf, I just didn't hole the putts.  I putted pretty awful, to be honest.   
 Q.  But you obviously had a day where you were striking it well.  It's like the game never has everything at the same time when you're trying to get back to where you used to be.  But when you're striking it that well, it must be encouraging?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it's small steps.  I can't expect it all.  It's not giving me it all.  But that's fine.  I'm really, really happy.  Tee to green I couldn't have played much better than I did today, to be honest with you.  And you finish with three bogeys and it leaves a sour taste.  It's an afternoon that could have gotten away, but it didn't.  And I'll get back out tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  Making the cut obviously is the first goal, but a four round major where you should have seen inside your goal, which is top-10, top 15.  But these steps are important for you now to get back to where you had been?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: It's just ball-striking runs like that, where I hole a few more putts, and it's just confidence levels and belief levels, and it's just all these things, really, you know.   
It was a frustrating round, disappointing round, because I did everything that I asked of myself today except get the ball in the hole.  So I know I'm a good putter, I just have to get a little more comfortable and just let it come.
