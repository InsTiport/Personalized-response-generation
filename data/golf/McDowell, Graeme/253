Q.   It's like finding a bug in a beer sometimes, isn't it?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, disappointing way to end the day.   I pulled my second shot on 8 there, which was really nice, 155‑yard 9‑iron, one‑hopped it in, and I kind of spun out my second shot with a 9‑iron into the right trap, and a very unusual scenario when I've got a small branch behind my ball with a leaf attached to it, and in the process of addressing my golf ball, I grazed the top of the leaf, and I'm deemed to have touched a loose impediment in a hazard, which is a two‑shot penalty.   Despite the fact that nothing has moved, the lie hasn't improved, I just didn't give the branch enough respect.   I've never seen that scenario before.

Q.   Were you aware of it at the time? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Getting into the bunker, my caddie said to me, "You know you can't touch that branch, right?"   I thought he meant of course I can't remove that branch.   I just didn't give it enough respect, and the second that I grazed it, we both knew perhaps we might be in trouble.   It was just kind of one of those moments where I've never seen that scenario before.   It's a tough lesson. 

Q.   Obviously a lot of positives to take out of today, though.   You're still in good shape.   It's hard to muster that right now I would imagine. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I played lovely today.   I gave myself a ton of chances, drove the ball well.   I had a new Cleveland driver in the bag this week which I hit really well.   I gave myself a load of chances.   It was a strong finish, very happy, and I'd have taken 4‑under par today.
