 Q.   There's like seven or eight possible European Ryder Cup players.   Any reason why you and the rest of the guys are playing so well this week?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   You know, it's just a good, tough golf course.   When you've got the top 50 in the world being exempt here, and that being the main reason why you've got a lot of European players here, good players are going to play well on tough golf courses, so no other real reason for that.   Just good pedigree on a tough golf course.   
Good to see.   Good to see, obviously.  
   
 Q.   After two days with Jordan, what's your overall impression of him?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, he's just a very, very solid player, doesn't do anything wrong, hasn't made a bogey in two days.   Anybody that shoots 11‑under for two days is going to look pretty good, especially around here.   He's a great player.   I really enjoyed playing with him.   He's very mature beyond his years.   You guys all know how good he is, as well, his display at Augusta, first‑timer there, and his display here as a first‑timer, he's got all the tools.   
   
 Q.   How is your game?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I've actually hit it okay the last couple days.   Disappointed there today, played the last six holes 2‑over.   I haven't been in good position.   Pretty happy with the steps I've made, though, just working on my swing a little bit the last couple weeks and getting my ball flight back a little bit.   All in all, game is in nice shape.   Looking forward to being here for the weekend.   Golf course gets nothing but tougher here, so you've just got to hang around.   What, seven or eight back, get out there tomorrow and see if I can't shoot 66 or 67 and get myself back in this thing.
