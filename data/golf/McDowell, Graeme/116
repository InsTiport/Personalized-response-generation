Q.   67, how did it feel, no breeze? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, it was perfect playing conditions.   Front nine was a little ugly for my own play.   I didn't see a fairway until the eighth, but shaking off that Christmas rust a little bit, and it was nice to hit a few good shots coming down the stretch there. 
But good to be back at it.   Nice to be back here in Dubai at one of the premiere events here in the Middle East.   It's been a few years since I've been here but nice to be back.

Q.   When you have so much time off, how much time do you take off, and how long is it before a championship such as this and the run you're coming into now, how long is it before you get back and get the sticks out of the cupboard?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I took a few weeks off sort of just before Christmas.   I put the sticks away and just enjoyed some family time and enjoyed the game.   I think it really depends where you're at, kind of how the season ends, kind of how much stuff you feel you need to work on and how much of a break you do need. 
I've been enjoying my off‑season breaks the last three or four years just trying to stay fresh.   I feel like come March, April, May time, I really feel the benefit of the break.

Q.   Kenny Convoy, knee surgery, and you have a new old caddie on the bag.   Tell us about that?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Kenny, going under the knife a few weeks ago, some minor meniscus tear surgery and he should be back in a few weeks' time.   I brought my old caddie out of retirement, Matt Harbour, worked for me 2004 through 2006.   We had some good success together.   He'll be thinking the job's easy enough after a decent first effort today. 

Q.   A little birdie tells me, you must want to win here a lot because this is where you got engaged a few years ago. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I did.   I got engaged to my now wife back in 2012 up in the helipad in the Burj Al Arab.   This is a special place for myself and the missus.   She's disappointed not to be here this week.   She's at home looking after our little one who just turned five months a few days ago. 
Getting hard to leave the nest but she sent me out, told me to go make a few quid and told me to come back and buy a new nappies and formula.   Babies go through that stuff quick. 

Q.   We have a great board, everyone's up there, you're up there amongst it.   What is it going to take?   With perfect weather, it's a birdie‑fest.   Do you let yourself drift forward and think, this is going to be the number?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   What do they always say, double the first round's score and add two, so we're looking around 18‑under par.   Yeah, looking at sort of what's historically won here, it's anything between sort of 14‑ and 22‑under par. 
So like you say, perfect scoring conditions.   We were lucky enough this afternoon, the sort of 11, 12 o'clock winds that you can nearly set your watch by every day didn't really appear today and looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow morning.   But the golf course is perfect.   The greens are perfect.   It really just depends if these things firm up a little bit as the weekends goes on.   I don't think they are going to firm up.   I think it will remain a birdie‑fest as the weekend goes on and hope to be in touch come the weekend.
