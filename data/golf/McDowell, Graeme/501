Q. Just another boring, regulation 72 then?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yep, just another dull 72, nothing much happened, that's right! Even par. Seriously I don't think I've had anything ever on the golf course quite like that, no. I've had an albatross before (Last hole of the final round of the 2003 Open de France at Le Golf National where he holed with a pitching wedge for an albatross two).

So that is my second one ever and they are a pretty rare bird. It is special very nice. I got off to a terrible start and the opening three were playing pretty difficult and I didn't get off to the start I wanted.

At the second I hit it under a tree and I had a restricted backswing and tried to chip it out and didn't quite make it back to the fairway, a regulation six really.

And I was walking down four with my caddie and things weren't going the way I was wanting it so we had a bit of a chat and decided to try and free things up a little bit and then I made a swing on the fourth which obviously found the bottom of the cup which was unbelievable. It was a good shot. I was right between a 5-wood and a 3-wood and I decided to try and cut a 3-wood in there and it just came out pretty much the way I envisaged it. The bottom of the pin was blind from the fairway, it was in a bit of a depression in the green. You can hit as good a shot as you like but you need a serious amount of luck for the ball to go in from that type of distance (237 yards).

We both thought it had just rolled off the back edge and I would have been perfectly happy with that but then the crowds went pretty nuts, so that was pretty cool.

Graeme was presented with a magnum of champagne and a weekend for two at The K Club after his round by Helen O'Brien, on behalf of the Smurfit European Open.
