 Q.   Good finish?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, good finish.   Frustrating day actually.   I played 18 holes, the back nine yesterday and the front nine today‑‑ very frustrating.   The last nine holes, especially last night, I played beautiful golf and just got nothing out of it.   The greens, yeah, kind of grew me out of the tournament, got a little frustrated on the back nine.   Birdied the last which was a great way to finish.   Unique scenario on the last, obviously the lightning, you can hear the thunder, and it just so happened it blew as my ballwas rolling.   Unique scenario.   
It would be frustrating if I had left it a foot away because obviously I wouldn't have had an opportunity, but just one of those things.   
   
 Q.   Overall, 18 holes where you just couldn't buy a putt, and the nine last night, it shows that tee‑to‑green you're playing really solid?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   My iron play this week has been right where I needed it to be.   Playing with Henrik, he's playing very nicely.   Hitting the ball very well.
