   GRAEME McDOWELL: I had a nice finish. I actually played good today. I hit a lot of fairways. The only tee I probably missed was 10 and I made bogey there, but that was my only bogey of the day, and it's probably the best golf I've played since Pebble. I've been a bit under the radar this week. It's felt nice. I've really been practicing well the last two days and it was nice to go out there and play and hit some fairways and hit some good iron shots and make some putts. It felt nice.  
  
  Q. Do you think it's taken that long to get what you've achieved and celebrating and everything, to get that out of your system and get playing again?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, very much so. If you think about the three events I've played since, Scottish Open, British Open, and Irish Open, they're probably three difficult events from that point of view anyway. They're normally tough weeks for me. You add in the U.S. Open stuff and it becomes extremely difficult weeks. So it's been tough to deal with, but like I say, somehow coming out here, I felt a lot fresher and a lot -- just a lot better about myself really and just been able to do my thing and fly a bit more under the radar.   
 Tiger Woods' show is in town so we'll have him in the limelight. I've felt better this week, and it's felt good and it's nice to be back to myself on the course.  
  
  Q. Having done what you did earlier this year, do you think that getting yourself into a position like this now, it gives you more against the field, more belief in what you can do?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think you certainly believe you can beat the world's best when you've beaten a field like the U.S. Open field. You definitely feel more comfortable in the mix in a tough event like this. I mean, Firestone hasn't really been a course that's been kind to me over the years. Probably I haven't been long enough off the tee.   
 I put a longer driver in the bag this week, and I've actually picked up about 15 yards. That's kind of really helped me off the tee. This golf course is a lot about driving the ball. I did that great today, and if I can keep doing that, hopefully I can compete on the weekend.   
  
  Q. Standing on the 15th tee, did you almost see that coming? You probably felt like you deserved a few birdies and they came all in a row.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Kind of. You know, I burned the edge on 13 and 14. I hit a really good 4-iron on 15 and manage to sneak it in there, and then I made three really nice putts coming in, sort of 12 feet, 20 feet and 12 feet on the last. So nice to hole some putts. Putter has been a little cold, certainly at the Irish Open, even at the British Open, as well, so it's nice to get that thing heated back up again.
