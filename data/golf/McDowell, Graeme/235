 Q.   You've been through two very tight matches.   How different was today's emotionally?   
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   You know, with the possibility of another 18 holes this afternoon, I was very keen to get the match out of the way as soon as I could, especially when I was 3‑ and 4‑up.   But Shane is a gritty competitor, very difficult to get the poker face on and really knuckle down and play Shane, being a good friend like he is.   When he hit that pin with the flop shot on 13, I was licking my chops there thinking I had a chance to go 5‑up with five to play, and all of a sudden I found myself down 16 and really not wanting to go down much past that.  
   
 Q.   Jason Day a couple years ago told me he likes to walk ahead of his opponents so they're always looking at his back.   He likes to make them putt tiddlers.   Are you ready for all that?   
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   That's nice to know, thanks, Tim.   Yeah, I enjoy the mano‑a‑mano of match play and the idiosyncrasies that different players have.   I've had a few players this week make me putt short ones, so I have no problem with that.   I think I'd probably prefer to play Jason than Bubba.   I think Bubba would have been playing a different golf course from me.   At least I can play the same golf course as J.D. and hopefully playing the way I'm playing I have a chance to beat him.
