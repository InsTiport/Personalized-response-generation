Q. Well played.  You must take a lot of positives from that round.
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, very much so.  I kind of did the hard part and played the front nine well.  I feel like the back nine here at the Emirates is there for the taking with three par 5s, and playing the front 4-under, and only shooting level par on the back was a little disappointing.
The breeze kicked up.  I thought the greens were quite firm and quite crusty on the back nine and they were starting to show their teeth and show their speed a little bit.  Happy enough for that and sets up a fun day tomorrow and something to kind of shoot at.
Q. Are you ready for a low one tomorrow?
GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm going to need a low one obviously but it is out there.  Obviously with the type of front nine I shot today.  And if you can get it going on the par 5s in the back, it's there for the taking.
But no, like you say, taking a lot of positives away from these first couple weeks back, seeing some good stuff, and very, very happy.  Can't be too disappointed.  Looking forward to getting out there tomorrow.
Looks like 20 or 30 minutes left to play.  The leaders will struggle, early alarm tomorrow, but we'll see.
Q. How was it out there for you?
GRAEME McDOWELL: After a perfect start, 4-under par after the front nine, I just kind of staggered a little.  Kind of sputtered home a little.  Greens I thought were getting quite fast and quite crusty there on the back nine.  Left a couple out there.
But all in all, I would have taken 4-under probably going out.  Happy enough the way the game felt there this afternoon.  It was close, and left -- like I say, a couple putts could have went in but overall happy enough.
Q. You were saying you were working on some long game stuff.  Seeing the fruits of that labour?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I've driven the ball much better this week.  That was a big key last week in Qatar.  The driver just was not behaving itself and this week I've really put the ball in play off the tee, and my iron play has felt really nice and felt good around the greens, as well.  There's been a couple of shots here or there every day away from really, really competing this week.
Obviously in decent position going into tomorrow.  Going to need a low one to win but we'll go out there and see what we can do.
