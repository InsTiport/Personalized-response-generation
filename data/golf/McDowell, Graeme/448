 Q. You made your Ryder Cup debut under Mr. Faldo, what do you think of the next one being Mr. Montgomerie?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I think Colin will make a fantastic captain. He's been around enough Ryder Cups, winning Ryder Cups, at that, to know what needs to be done. Had a pretty good chat with him after the last one, and I'm sure we'll have a bigger and better and badder team in Wales. 
 I think he'll do everything right, and like I say, he knows what a winning Ryder Cup Team requires, and I think he's going to be very certainly dot all of the I's and cross all of the T's, and I think he's going to be a very, very good captain.

 Q. Any particular attributes you think he's got?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I mean, just a positive outlook on how to do it. I'm sure he's led Europe out many times in the singles and he's been there and he understands the pressure. He knows the players really well, as well, which I think is huge. He knows us all really well. He's still a competitor himself. 
 Kind of surprised in a little way because I think maybe he would have the game to maybe get on the next team, but it's big of him obviously to take the captaincy and lead us to victory in Wales. 
 Being in touch with the players and knowing them as well as he does, I think is huge.
