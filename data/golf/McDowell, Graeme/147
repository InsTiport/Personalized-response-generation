  GRAEME McDOWELL: Better day today.  The ball flight control, what I talked about yesterday which had to improve, did improve today.  I hit the ball much, much better, controlled, maybe wasn't as sharp in and around the greens today.  Yes, we got the good side of the draw today, there's no doubt about that.  Certainly more benign conditions this afternoon. Greens were getting quite crusty, quite difficult to putt this afternoon.  All in all it was a good afternoon for scoring, and certainly reflected in the scores.  Obviously two 66s from Rory is a bit special, but he is just that.  He is a bit special.  So he's going to be tough to catch this weekend if he keeps that up.   Q.  Just on him briefly, he's been under a lot of scrutiny for his Friday performances --  GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, anymore questions?  Friday -- there's no doubt, I mean, obviously I saw the stat this morning, 43-under par on Thursdays and is 11-over on Fridays or whatever.  Last week in you look at the Scottish Open, very difficult conditions on Friday. It's always tough to back up good first rounds.  And he certainly put any demons that might have been there, he certainly put those to bed today.  You run out of superlatives when you're describing the kid's game.  He's unbelievable.  And no one will be surprised if he addresses the third leg of the Grand Slam this weekend.   Q.  Your back nine, can you talk about that?  GRAEME McDOWELL: I bogeyed 9 from just off the left side of the green there.  Tough two-putt.  And I made two decent swings to 10, got it up and down.  And made a good putt on 11.  Sort of got me off and running. I desperately wanted to play this weekend.  Was really happy with the way I hit the golf ball today.  And I wanted to get two more rounds under my belt this weekend, and try and post a good finish and head off to Canada next week with some good feelings.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  GRAEME McDOWELL: Tough to know.  Weather is going to play a huge element this weekend, and it really just depends on what happens tomorrow.  I haven't seen any forecasts.  The last one I saw was rain. Anything can happen.  I came from 8 back a couple of weeks ago.  This is a world class field at the Open Championship.  Like I say, I'm just going to try to control my ball and see what happens the next couple of days.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  GRAEME McDOWELL: I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.   Q.  Did you work with him?  GRAEME McDOWELL: I never really worked with Bob officially.  I spent many a fun hour or two on the range here or there with him.  He's just a legend of the European Tour.  He's going to be sorely missed on the ranges.  Thoughts and prayers go out to his family.  He's just one of golf's great guys and golf's great legends.
