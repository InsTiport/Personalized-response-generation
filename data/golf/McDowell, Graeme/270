  GRAEME McDOWELL:   It was a wet old start.   I played some decent golf.   It was a funny day.   I was a couple under in the early part of the day and things were starting to brighten up and 17, leave myself 90 yards pin and get a bit of a jumper out of the wet fairways into the bushes over the back, lost ball; make double there. 
Was kind of fighting from then on really.   I couldn't really get it going on the greens, and have to sit there and watch my playing partners both shoot 5‑under, and 1‑under par, it was a frustrating day for me in the end.

Q.   As far as this place goes, it's pretty benign. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   They have the golf course set up for tough weather today.   We didn't really get it this morning.   There was a 3‑, 4‑, 5‑under par out there for sure, if not lower, and yeah, 1‑under par is not really capitalising on some easy morning play. 
So, you know, I've got a little bit of work to do from here but it's three good rounds and one great round is going to win this weekend.   This is one of my okay rounds out of the way. 

Q.   How did it feel out there today? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It felt great.   Crowds are fantastic, ten‑deep down each fairway and great receptions every green.   Fantastic.   It's like the Irish Opens the last few years, they have all just been incredible and this one is cranked up just a little bit more.   It's special. 
The course was there for the taking to be honest with you.   It was a bit wet early on when we teed off this morning but The European Tour set the course up for tough conditions today and they never really came. 
We got very lucky with the conditions this morning and really should have done better.   1‑under par is about the worst I could have shot really.   I didn't capitalise on a few holes.   Played the first five or six holes 2‑under par in tough conditions and then when it brightened up, I couldn't seem to do anything about it. 
But 17 was a pivotal hole for me.   90 yards for me, get a bit of a jumper out of the wet fairways over the back, make double‑bogey with a lob‑wedge in my hand; that's just a cardinal error. 
Apart from that, pleased with the way I hit the golf ball.   Hit a lot of solid shots.   Maybe just didn't hit it quite close enough with my irons and wedges but nothing to panic about.   I just need to do better tomorrow. 

Q.   The hype has been here for a long time.   What was it like actually getting out there and playing the first round? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Actually felt great this morning.   Felt like I got a nice groove and the crowds were fantastic, and really nice three ball with Simon and PÃ¡draig.   We had good fun.   As I say the atmosphere was great, despite the bad weather this morning, the crowds were all there and they were great. 

Q.   Looks like it's going to get windier for this afternoon as well, so these boys could be in for a time. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   You never want to wish ill on the opposite half of the draw but we had it tough with the rain and the wet and the cold this morning.   But we will see how this afternoon does.   Like I say, the golf course is set up with some wind in mind and we'll see if that comes. 

Q.   You've been looking forward to this so much but you said there was a danger you could get caught up in the emotion of the whole situation.   How was it for you today? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Fine this morning from that point of view, I feel like I settled into the round nicely.   Conditions this morning, morning up in the rain, and the first five or six holes in the rain, you really have to get the attitude correct; I did that.   I played the first six holes a couple under par and was cruising nicely and then 17, 90 yards pin, got a little aggressive, I don't know if I got a little bit of a flyer out of the wet fairways and walk off with double on a very birdieable hole. 
Steadied the ship nicely, made a birdie on 2 and missed a short one on 3 and missed a short one on 5; 3‑putt 7.   So the story was kind of on the greens.   Disappointing way to finish.   But 1‑under par, it's not panic, but I'll need to play two good ones and one solid round from here to have a chance to compete. 
I have to do better tomorrow.

Q.   How proud are you of the way the course is presented?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   The course is fantastic.   We have had a huge amount of rain the last couple of months so it is softer than we would like it but that's Mother Nature.   I'm just so proud of the way that Royal Portrush have put the place together, European Tour and everyone involved, Northern Irish Tourist Board and all of the fans coming out and supporting us.   They have really got behind this tournament at Portrush and great receptions for myself and PÃ¡draig and even Dys on every green today.   It was a lot of fun to be out there and be part of it.
