Q. I guess the wind was a little bit down today but that's still a hard golf course out there and you found a half dozen birdies?
GRAEME McDOWELL: It was up-and-down and out of a slightly different direction today, but got off to a fast start and kind of ran into a little bit of a brick wall there on 5 and 6.  I made two fives and a six on No. 6, so has not been particularly good to me.
The double on 6 today was born out of trying to hit a very positive lay-up shot.  Hit in the right rough, didn't have a great lie.  Tried to chop a hybrid up the right side, double-crossed it into the hazard and my first bit of water of the week and made six.
But great bounce back with a birdie on 7, and you know, played really solidly on the back nine.  So happy with that.  This is a golf course which I do enjoy.  It's been go to me over the years.  It's a tough course and you certainly have to control your ball in this breeze.
Q. Just a handful of birdies at 7.  That was playing tough.
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I hit a 3-hybrid there and that really kind of got me going again.  After making bogey, double, to hit it close there, make two, was nice.  It kind of got me back on the rails again.  Kept me relaxed, and I'm enjoying the way I'm playing and more importantly, I'm enjoying the way I'm feeling on the golf course.  I'm feeling very relaxed and very patient, and just starting to see some of the rewards of all the work I've been doing the last six months.
You can never predict what's going to happen but I really feel like I'm doing a lot of things the right way again, and I've just got to be real patient.  I feel like I can have a big year, but I've got to stay very patient and keep in the processes.  Weekends like this one, rounds like that today, it's just going to give me the confidence to keep kind of going forward and pour that back into the game and we'll see what happens.
