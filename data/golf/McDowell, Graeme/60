Q. Your thoughts on the week?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, very pleasing week in general.  I wish I had felt as comfortable on the back nine as I did on the front nine all week but that's one of those things.  Sometimes the golf course fits your eye in places and doesn't fit it in others.  The back nine really wasn't flicking my switches this week and I didn't play it very well.  Especially holes like 18, if I played 18 better all week, I think I played it 1-over for the week, which on a hole where Tiger Woods played 7-under par here in 2006 is slightly disappointing.
One of those things, all in all, great week.  I thought The Grove was a spectacular venue.  This golf tournament has reestablished as one of the premiere events on The European Tour and I thought we got incredibly lucky with the weather.  Everything was made for a great week this week.
I didn't quite get it going as hot as I did yesterday.  It was trick ear today and breeze was stronger.  Greens were more receptive; ball-in-hand, preferred lies.  It was there but couldn't get it going.
Pity I didn't play the back nine better this week, but really happy where I'm at and how the game is trending and looking forward to a strong finish to the year.
Q. Elaborate on that, because there's big events to come.
GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm going to go back and play a couple of the events in the States at the end of the year.  I'm going to defend at Mayakoba and play Vegas the week before and I'm going to be in Melbourne for the World Cup with Shane Lowery.  Disappointed not to factor more in the Final Series.  No HSBC for me and I'm right on the edge for Dubai.
I'll focus on those two events.  It's always important to friends when you get the opportunity to defend, and I look forward to finishing down in Melbourne, should be pretty cool.
Q. That really got you back on track, didn't it?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, straightened out a tough year.  2015 wasn't my best year and 2016 has been a lot more like it.  A bit more consistent but I like the way I'm trending.  It's been two successful weeks in Europe.  Nice to come back and see everyone.  The weather behaved itself and the golf courses were awesome and I enjoyed my two weeks.
