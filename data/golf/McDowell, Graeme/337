   LAURA HILL: Graeme, thanks for taking a couple minutes. A long day and kind of some chaos at the end there, but talk about the day and then where you see things going for tomorrow. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I mean, we were in a nice position. We always knew we were going to have like an hour and a half when they announced back in position, so we weren't really too much in a panic. We were able to relax, put the feet up and eat lunch about three times and all that good stuff. 
 Golf course had changed significantly when we did get back out there. The greens were a lot more receptive, the fairways were a lot more receptive, so you can play the golf course much more aggressively, and I think that's going to make for low scoring tomorrow. Under no illusions; maybe if the golf course had have stayed the same way it was yesterday and continued to firm up, 10-, 11-under might have won this golf tournament, but I think it's going to take 15, 16, maybe more, with the way things have softened up.

 Q. That said, one of the things of going to May and course renovation was improving drainage and putting SubAir and stuff like that. When you got back out on the course, any surprise about how good the course actually was, in what condition it was?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It was in fabulous condition, no doubt about it. I'm not sure how much rain fell in the afternoon. I assume it was quite a lot. The golf course had taken it unbelievably well. Wasn't picking up much mud at all. The greens were receptive but they weren't like puddings. They were taking a good shot, yes, but it's fantastic. It's in great condition, and the SubAir certainly does its job. I'd imagine the SubAir will be pumping all night and maybe the greens will be starting to firm up come tomorrow afternoon again. 
 Like I say, I'm not saying scoring fest tomorrow but I'm saying much more scorable than it would have been. 

 Q. It looks like there's going to be a slew of guys within about five shots, and given that it's going to be -- you can play more aggressively to flags, I would imagine maybe 25, 30 guys might still have a crack at this?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: For sure. I could see someone going and shooting 62, 63 tomorrow. I think there's a low score on this golf course, depending on what the wind does tomorrow, of course. But it really has opened the field up a little bit, these conditions now. There was some good scoring this morning even before the delay. I know Peter Hanson was 7-under through 16 holes. But it just shows you what can be done on this golf course. It's not long by modern standards and when you start attacking some pins you can make some scores. 
 It's going to be exciting. This is probably one of the most exciting finishes in world golf, and to have that many guys within striking distance tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of fun hopefully to be part of.
