Q.   Really tough out there, wasn't it. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Very, very, very difficult out there.   I wish I could go back to the 15th green and start again.   I hit a great shot in there to about four feet and missed it to go 1‑under for the tournament. 
And, you know, middle of the fairway on 16, the wind was just gusting so hard, I 3‑putt there. 
17, all three of us hit it left off the tee.   I make bogey there. 
And the last was disappointing.   Trying to hit a hard cut off that trap and hit it through straight into the bunker and tried to lay up with a wedge and catch it a fraction clean, and the thing just finds 20 yards and goes in the water.   So, game over, unfortunately. 
Story of what could have been, both these last two days, because I played okay, I really did.   I hung in there well today.   A couple early 3‑putts, but generally I was there or thereabouts. 
But conditions were very tough today.   These greens were really difficult to putt on this golf course.   They are a little slow and you know, you've really got to force it from short range, and especially in these type of conditions, you're going to leave yourself a lot of 5‑ and 6‑footers.

Q.   Can you remember a time where the three of you hit provisional balls off‑‑
GRAEME McDOWELL:   No.   I was walking off the 17 tee box thinking that has to be the first of my career where all three guys have hit provisional balls, all potentially needing to hit them.   It was a strange scenario.

Q.   In terms of the way the wind swirls around here, people talk about it, but is it unique or is it just more difficult here? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I don't think it's unique.   This is a tree‑lined golf course, switches direction quite often so the winds tend to tunnel down the tree lines.   You know, Valderrama, you find the same thing going on, and you find it happening on very mature, tree‑lined golf courses like this one, and that was a really tough afternoon's golf. 
We certainly got the wrong end of the stick on the draw this week, but you know, that's the way the cookie crumbles.   Like I say, I just didn't finish off any of my two rounds these last two days.   I was in decent position coming into 16 both days and I played it 4‑over yesterday and 3‑over today, those last three holes.   This is Wentworth; you're supposed to play those last three a couple under.

Q.   Do you just write it off? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, you just right it off, yeah.   I have a couple of things to work on on my game but this is not panic button.   I missed the cut at THE PLAYERS by one, and looks like I'm going to miss it by one here, maybe two, probably one. 
Disappointing is what it is, but the game is not far away.   I just need to piece it all together and get ready to go for Memphis and U.S. Open and on for a big summer really.   This is not really one of my happy hunting grounds, shall we say.   This is a golf course I would like to come and play well.   I don't particularly do it.
