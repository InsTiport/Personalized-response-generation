   GRAEME McDOWELL: Bunker play wouldn't really be a strength at the best of times but out of these traps, they are just unplayable. So just can't score. This golf course, first and foremost, you have to drive it well to have a chance, and I didn't do that. So you're behind the 8-ball. 
 And yeah, I just went chasing a little bit those last nine holes, and tried to fire at some pins and made a couple numbers. But disappointing. The game is just not there. You know, it's still a work-in-progress. Game is just kicking me right now. But, you kick on.
