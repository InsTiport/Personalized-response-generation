 Q.  Tell us about the second at 17? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yeah, you know, just one of those things that happen in golf.  It's one of mows magic moments.  I've never quite felt anything like it.  I don't have to stand up on 18 and try to hit one of the tee shots in golf after what just happened, and unbelievable, what a feeling and to do it on Sunday afternoon at Valderrama, what a crowd; it will stay with me for a long time. 

 Q.  After 18, your heart rate must have been going? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yeah, all the standing around and waiting trying to calm down, it didn't make a great tee off 18 tee.  I split that fairway off 18 three times this week and obviously the 3-putt, I was a little bit razzled on the first putt.  I knew I needed to try to make par to stay 1-under and have a chance of winning today and blew it by.  I thought I made the one coming back but that's kind of irrelevant. 
 Disappointing, obviously, but a bit of massive ups and massive downs, but equates to birdie, par finish, so I guess I'll take it. 

 Q.  7-iron? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  7-iron from, don't know, 200.  It's my third in tournament play. 
 Hearing the crowd, probably one of the best feelings I've ever had in a golf course walking down the fairway.  I couldn't see it go in. 

 Q.  What was the exact yardage? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  I had 186 yards front edge past the pin and it was 20 yards, so around 200 yards 7-iron. 

 Q.  Did you give the ball away to a kid? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  I threw it into the crowd.  Like I said, great feeling, unbelievable. 

 Q.  How hard is it to take a deep breath and refocus? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  Very difficult.  If I'd have chipped in for three, made birdie, obviously making, two, massive adrenaline rush and have to try my best to calm myself down. 
 I made a terrible swing on 18, there's no other way to describe it. 

 Q.  And the delay, as well? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  The delay, as well, but the delay helped me calm down a little bit.  Who knows what would have happened if I hit it straightaway. 

 Q.  The next couple of days reflecting on the season and this week, what will you think? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  I've underachieved a little bit this season but massive positives, great finish, positive finish.  Feeling great about my game, I have to say.  And you know, I feel like this year has been a breakthrough year as far as getting me back on the map a little bit.  Just looking forward to the next few seasons now, you know, obviously Ryder Cup next year and this will be a nice boost points-wise and World Ranking points and all that good stuff. 
 So just generally excited about what's going on in my game right now, and as I say, big year, disappointing in many ways. 
 I'm going to play Hong Kong I think, see how we feel and keep going.  Looking forward to a bit of time off.  I feel like my game is good enough to where maybe I would like to keep playing a little bit more, but I think mentally I'm ready for a little bit of rest.
