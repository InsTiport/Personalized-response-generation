Q. Graeme, yesterday you hit a beautiful 66.  That's a great number, only one back.  Today you've got a couple in the red.  You said to me as you walked up that was interesting.GRAEME McDOWELL: I started on the back nine today.  I didn't play very well, I got to be honest.  I was missing the fairways.  I was scrambling, scrambling, scrambling, and hung in there incredibly well the first nine holes.  I actually hit it well. My second nine holes, I made a silly 6 on the 2nd.  I was 25, 30 feet for eagle there and walked off with a 6.  I putted it off, it came off the front of the green. Then I three-putted on 6 for bogey as well, from long range to be fair, and missed a couple of chances.  It was kind of one of those days, it could have easily gotten away from me my first nine holes. Then the second nine, I kind of ended up being a little frustrated because I felt like it was there.Q. Have you figured out a way to play this course?GRAEME McDOWELL: I think just when my expectation level started to kind of drop coming into this week, I started to kind of find out how to play it.  Especially this year, the golf course is firm and fast and really tricky and better for guys like me and Jim Furyk, rather than the usual Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroys that play well around Firestone. This year, extremely difficult, extremely tricky, and really requiring a lot of grinding.  I guess that suits my game a little bit more than normal.Q. Currently 169th.  Are you where you want to be to make the playoffs?  Do you see this weekend as a great opportunity?GRAEME McDOWELL: Pretty much so.  I think I need about a third or a fourth this weekend to get myself locked into the FedEx playoffs.  I'd be lying if I said that that was really my goal.  I'm looking at the bigger picture.  I'm trying to get back on the leaderboards and trying to play the kind of golf that I know I'm capable of, and the rest will take care of itself. If I get myself into the playoffs, great, I'll play option A schedule that I have.  And if I don't get into the playoffs, I've got an option B schedule, which means going back to Europe, which wouldn't be a bad gig either.
