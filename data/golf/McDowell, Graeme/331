 Q. Your reaction? Disappointed obviously. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think this afternoon I just didn't putt well. I felt like every putt I looked at this afternoon was a and I just couldn't seem to pick it. I had a 5-footer on the second green to go 2-up which I missed and two holes later, I'm 1-down, 2-down, in fact, three holes later. 
 So Nicolas played really solid after that. I have to give him credit for the way he hit the golf ball coming down the stretch. He played really well.
 And apart from hitting under the lip of a couple bunkers today, I got a couple of bad breaks early on. And then 16 was a killer really. Right under the lip there, just in the middle of that trap with only 160 to go there and I'm in decent position. 
 Yeah, frustrating after the way I played and putted this morning, just was a little loose on the greens this afternoon. Couldn't quite see them. And that's match play. He played really well, and made me have to go for my shots and just couldn't quite do it.
