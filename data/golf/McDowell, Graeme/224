  GRAEME McDOWELL:   I played solidly again today.   Struck it good yesterday, and made nothing coming in, especially the last 10 or 11 holes and was keen to get back out there this morning, and hit more fairways and greens, which I did really well today.   I managed to make a few putts, as well.   It was really good ball‑striking the last couple of days and looking forward to the weekend.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
GRAEME McDOWELL:   For sure.   Obviously I'm one of the newest memberships of Team RBC this season, and this is a golf course which I've always enjoyed.   I didn't play here last year and kind of regretted it.   Here we are this year. 
It is a golf course that sets up well for me.   You don't have to move it very far off the tee, but you have to position it really well.   And you have to play patient golf, which suits my type of play.   I'm reasonably straight and a good iron player.   And thankfully I've managed to play a decent round today and position myself hopefully for a nice weekend.

Q.   You have to play it backwards, looking at where the pin is before you hit your tee shot.   With your game that just suits perfectly for this golf course?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Definitely.   This golf course has stood the test of time.   It doesn't need to be long.   Modern technology has not sort of made this golf course old‑fashioned in any shape or form.   Sometimes the fairway is not good enough, you have to be on the left side or the right side, 300 yards might be too much and 250 might not be enough at times.   So you really have to play par‑3s off the tees, and really try to position your irons going into the greens.   Very hard to hit a lot of greens around here, so you must chip and putt, as well.   The guy that wins here this week will have control of his golf ball.
