GRAEME McDOWELL:  A really tough match.  We both played scrappy golf at times.  Darren didn't look like he was ever going to make a mistake, to be honest.  His short game was unbelievable.  He was holing putts.  I made a good putt on 8 from about 12 feet for birdie, and he was sitting six feet away, and I thought he was going to knock this in and go on, and I was 2 down.  He misses that one.

I go back to 1, and I plug it in the bunker at 9.  And again, he has five feet for the hole.  And I'm thinking, well, he's not going to miss it.  And he did, he missed again.  All of a sudden a couple of chinks in his armor, and I thought, well, if I hang in there and hang in there, I can just about perhaps grind this one out.

I made a great birdie on 15, and Darren missed    sorry, on 16.

I had my chance on 17 from about 15 feet and missed obviously.  And I hit the worst left all day long, and I hit the worst swing of the day right there, I don't know what I was thinking.  It was a straightforward, 200 yard 3 iron, and I hit it in the junk.  I had a good shot on my third and made a good putt.
Q.  He won 15?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  That was what I was trying to lead up to, but not in the rough.  I'm pretty pumped up about that.  I've never gotten on top of him, ever, until the very last.  So I'm pretty pumped about that, really.
Q.  How was this round for you?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  It was just one 18 hole round of golf against a very good player.  Things happen even, birdies, bogeys.  I'm sure Darren is disappointed.  We both played scrappy.
