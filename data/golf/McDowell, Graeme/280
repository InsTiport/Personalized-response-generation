 Q.   You had good results and you never gave up the lead?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It was actually a very good game.   With both made a lot of birdies and we were both probably 4‑ or 5‑under par and really there are no easy matches in this format.   Richard Finch might not jump off the page as one of the top names at the tournament but they are all quality players and you have to play your best and see what happens.  
I'm very happy with that match and have to re‑set now and get ready for this afternoon.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts on playing Sergio Garcia?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Sergio is a tough player and obviously knows his way around some Spanish golf courses.   You want to play against the best players and like I say it really doesn't make a huge amount of difference what name you're going to play because all of these guys are capable of shooting low numbers and I've just got to go and try and beat them.   
I feel like I'm playing well and getting the hang of this golf course as the days go on.   Looking forward to the game.   
   
 Q.   How was that?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   That was good.   I played well, made three or four birdies in the first five or six holes and Richard hung in there really well all day.   It was a good match.   It was one that had to be one as opposed to be given.   
Like I was saying, it really doesn't matter what name you're looking at on the same page.   All of these guys are quality players and capable of making seven or eight birdies on this golf course.   You have to keep your head down, and I've putted better as the week has gone on.   Played solid today and I was very happy with some of the shots I hit.   
   
 Q.   Can't take anything for granted even when you're ahead.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   For sure, you've never really got these guys beaten, because they are quality players.   Like I say Richard Finch is maybe not a name that jumps off the page at you as one of the top players, but he is; he's a very good player and he's won tournaments around the world and he knows how to win.   You can't take anyone lightly and you have to play the golf course first and foremost and then play the man after that.   
Sergio, obviously a quality player, and a guy I know very well, I love to play with him.   But you know, I've got to put my business hat on this afternoon and try to beat him because we both desperately want to get to tomorrow morning.   
Unfortunately one of us is going home tonight but I'm happy with the way I'm swinging the club and just have to keep doing it.   
   
 Q.   How are the elements; a bit overcast and different wind direction to yesterday.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   The golf course played nice this morning, fairly benign early on and the wind got up on the back nine.   
We just finished up on 16.   We were hitting 8‑irons in there on Thursday and today I hit driver, 3‑wood 20 yards short of the green.   That tells you it was pretty wet and pretty windy at the time.   It's tricky, but it's match play thank goodness and it's the same for everyone.
