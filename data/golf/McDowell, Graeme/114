  GRAEME MCDOWELL:   I think I have some work to do.   I have a little bit of work to do with the driver.   I don't know what was going on with the driver, so I've got to work that out. 

Q.   Uneventful sum it up?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Somewhat.   I felt very in control of my emotions all day.   I tried to go out there and execute a conservative game plan, not take too many shots on, within reason, you know, because it's hard not to be aware of the fact that the scoring was low.   And the greens are very receptive.   And there was a score out there. 
You see Jordan Spieth making nine birdies behind me.   And you're trying to execute a conservative game plan, but at the same time you've got to make some birdies.   And there were a few too many mistakes, but there were enough birdies to keep things good.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Yeah, I putted okay today.   It wasn't a special putting round, but it was a real solid putting round.   And that's kind of more what I expect of myself on these type of greens. 
And like I spoke about in practice, that was really my kind of concentration.   And I was focusing especially on putting.   I putted well today.   These greens really‑‑ there are some nuances in them that you have to know.   There's a lot of course knowledge involved.   So I hit some good putts, knowing what they were going to do and I still had a few that's just this golf course. 

Q.   Another year putt willing has been a part of the game that you wish would be more solid here.   So then you finally put together a solid putting round and your driving let you down.   How do you take that?   Do you look at it as positive or is it frustrating?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Golf.   Just golf.   In this game when you work on one thing and you get it right it's amazing how something else goes.   If you'd get everything right every day you'd shoot nothing.   That's just the game of golf.   And that's what keeps us coming back for more. 
Like I say, I get my driver under control tomorrow, get back out there.   It all bodes well.   If I can make the weekend and contend in some shape or form, I'll be very happy. 

Q.   Is it a case that over the years you may not have had the right respect to be out here (inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   I never really felt like I came into this week negative.   But I do feel that I get frustrated on this golf course.   And perhaps I've been a little bit, I don't know ‑‑ really the golf course kind of beat me down little bit. 
So today I tried to be very kind of emotionally level.   And just, you know, play within my strengths and not take too many shots on, tee shots off 13, I'm hitting 3‑wood off there, rather than hitting a golf shot that makes me very uncomfortable.
I played the par 5s conservative today and made a few birdies and I've got to keep that kind of attitude going, keep as emotionally level as I possibly can be.

Q.   You're a good putter, you have a good mind in terms of taking on a tough golf course, and surely they're the strengths that make you be a good player around the Masters?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Absolutely, and that's what I'm trying to focus on.   Like I say, good putting, relying on that, you know, trying to be smart coming into these greens.   All I can say, the golf course scoring was good today.   There was a fine balance between playing too conservatively, because you had to put up some birdies today.
