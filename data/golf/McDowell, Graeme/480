   GRAEME McDOWELL:  Slightly different roar when he's making birdies; you know he's making birdies, as opposed to someone else.   
 Yeah, I'm disappointed that I didn't give him more of a run coming in, but at the same time very happy with the week's golf.   
  
  Q.  On the positive side, quite a lot of Ryder Cup points.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yeah, Ryder Cup points, World Ranking points, confidence, all good things early in the season.   
 My game feels in great shape.  I'm very happy with my last three tournaments.  I had a great week in Abu Dhabi.  Qatar I was frustrated because I was not in the mix more and again I feel like I was playing well again and good round this week, nothing but positives.   
  
  Q.  Where are you going from here?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  I'm playing India, then two off and then I'll play those three, India, Malaysia and Korea.   
 Good players playing, and I know the golf course before, so I'm looking forward to next week.   
  
  Q.  Looking at the Italian Open, you know it feels like a long time ago you were saying, like an age ago --   
 GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yeah, I'm dying to win a tournament but you can't let that get in the way of the next shot you're going to hit.   
 Winning tournaments is very difficult because it's four rounds, great players, and everyone is really, really high standard nowadays and it is hard to get across the line and see guys like Ernie Els, one of the best players in the world and Tiger is just giving him four or five starts today and psyching them out, it's difficult getting across the line, so all you can do is try to string four rounds together and if you're picking up the silverware, great and if not, take the positives and keep working hard.   
 Like I said, I'm dying to get back in the winner's circle.  You can't rush these things.  You have to be patient I guess.
