 Q.   Your thoughts on two days?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yesterday was very solid.   Today was a little untidier in general, but I hung in there.   I haven't really lit the world up on the greens yet this week, but you know, it was kind of tough to focus when playing with Dustin Johnson, hitting it 350 yards in the middle of the fairways.   It was kind of a little demoralising at times.   
But I was happy that I hung in there.   I hit some good shots today.   Played very solidly yesterday.   Today was a little off, like I say, but happy to shoot 3‑under par.   
In a decent position going into the weekend, so looking forward to it.   This is a golf course that, yes, the long guys like.   But it also rewards good iron play and the greens are fantastic, so you can make some putts.  
   
 Q.   Your position relative to that leader isn't pretty but it is only halfway I guess.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, for sure, what, six back going into the weekend, you know, I wouldn't say you'll take that every week, but it's certainly not out of contention by any stretch of the imagination.  
Like I say, DJ drove the ball phenomenal for two days.   Looked a little loose coming in there today‑‑ you know, who knows.   If he keeps playing the way he's played the last two days, he'll be tough to catch.   But there's a long way to go, a lot of quality players in this tournament.   There's a lot of low scores in this golf course, and like I say, just happy to be kind of in contention going into the weekend.  
   
 Q.   And absolutely you've had a front row seat for what is possible around this track.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, you know, what's possible for an athlete like him who just rips it; that's not what's possible for the rest of us sometimes.   It was probably one of the best driving displays I've seen this year for sure.   It was pretty immense.   He's got a short game to match, as well.   
So he's an impressive guy.   When he's in the mood and when he's on form, he's pretty prolific.
