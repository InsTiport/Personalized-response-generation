  GRAEME McDOWELL: I haven't blown myself out of the tournament which is a good thing.   I'm still well within touch for tomorrow. 
I didn't play very well today.   Rhythm was a bit out, whether that was something to do with the winds yesterday or what.   I didn't have a very good warm up this morning.   I was a bit out of rhythm out there. 
It was a kind of hang‑in sort of day.   I feel really good on the greens so if I can get my iron play‑‑ well, first of all, my driving of the ball, I need to drive it in the fairway more tomorrow.   I didn't drive it in the fairways enough today.   Didn't give my iron play a chance. 
So my iron play is in decent shape, wedge play is good, putting's good.   I just need to get in the fairway a bit more often tomorrow.   A bit out of rhythm, a bit out of sorts?

Q.   That happens with windy days? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Sometimes.   I think that probably was reflected in the scoring today a little bit.   Apart from a few low ones this morning, there was nothing really going on this afternoon.   Guys that played well in the wind yesterday maybe didn't play so well today.   So wind can do that to you a little bit.
