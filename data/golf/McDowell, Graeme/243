  GRAEME McDOWELL:   I needed a low one today.   Slightly different wind direction so the golf course played a lot different today but drove the ball well, which you must do around this golf course.   It's pretty wide open.   
If you can hit it long and straight, although that works all over the world, it's very important here at Lake Malaren.   So a good day.   Gets me kind of back in touch with the leaders and something to shoot for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   An especially good score, the course is set up pretty tough today, looking at 17?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, the back nine especially played a little more difficult today because 14, 16 and 18 especially are playing very difficult back into the wind, long par 4s to start with, and yeah, it was a trickier back nine.   Like you say, 17, that front pin is quite difficult.   I made some nice birdies around the middle of the back nine and hit some good shots coming in and couldn't quite capitalise and drove it in the bunker on the last.   The last is a four and a half anyway, so we'll take it and run.  
   
 Q.   Clustered leaderboard for tomorrow?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Sure, there's a ton of players in touch going into tomorrow, a lot of quality names on the leaderboard, and like I say, I'm just happy to kind of be back in the hunt again, give myself half a chance, and if they don't go too crazy on me on the way in, I'll be three or four shots back going into tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on today, please?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Good day's work, that.   Conditions were a little different today.   Wind direction had switched, made the back nine play quite tough; 14 and 18 especially playing back into that prevailing breeze.   18 was playing quite long and I kind of missed my tee shot in the left bunker off the tee and I had my work cut out from there.   All in all it was a great day's work.   Drove the ball really nicely.   Gave myself a lot of chances and rolled it quite well on the greens again today.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts when you start play ten strokes behind the leader?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Got to go low, basically.  
   
 Q.   Does that mean you try to force it, go a bit more aggressive than you might otherwise or just try to let it happen?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Just try to let it happen really.   You have to stick to your game plan.   This golf course gives you opportunities in different areas.   Like I say, driving the golf ball is key around this golf course.   There's a lot of long hillers on this leaderboard, there's no surprise, because this is wide open off the tee, this course, and it is kind of grip it and rip it a little bit.   If you can drive the ball well here, you've got half a chance.   I drove it probably the best that I have all week and it was reflected in my score.   
I see Jay de shot 65 and a 66 from me, so a couple low ones.   When you get the greens soft and receptive, the best players in the world will still be able to shoot low numbers.   Even with a slightly different wind direction today, there were still some opportunities, a couple of par 5s played downwind.   They had the tee on 15 a little further forward, so that was playing pretty short.   But it was a good balance.   This is a good golf course, good balance out there, and some tough pins, and just nice to be sort of semiâ€‘in touch going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   A 66 again would do you fine?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   A 66 I would take my chances.   Might not be enough but would be a good weekend's work, and that's one step in the right direction today and looking forward to tomorrow.
