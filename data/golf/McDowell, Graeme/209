 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   I steadied the ship for birdies on 9 and 10 and then a mistake on 11 where I kind of got a bit of a jumper out of the fairway over the back there and make six there, which was a disappointing end last night after feeling kind of like I dug in.   
And then this morning it was just difficult.   Kind of hung in, hung in, made great pars on 14 and 15.   Bad second shot at the 16th and par stroke birdie on 17.   Rip it down the middle of 18 and finish a yard in the rough and no lie.   I was trying to miss that second shot as far left as I could and it kind of squirted right on me.   And I had two very, very hard chip shots.   The first one was difficult, the second one was a scruffy lie in the rough and I walked off there with double off a great tee shot.   
But 18's a tough hole.   I didn't think it was a 3‑wood, perhaps in hindsight it was a 3‑wood off the tee.   But disappointing because I hit a lot of good shots today.   
The beauty of the U.S. Open though is that it's not over.   I can go and shoot 3, 4‑under par this afternoon.   Even a couple under par.   Get me in for the weekend.   I probably need three 68s, three 67s from here.   That won't be far away.   So all is not lost.   Disappointing start, no doubt about it, but we'll prepare and get back out there this afternoon.
