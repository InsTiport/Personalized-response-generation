 Q. When Gregory Havret did not make birdie at 18, how, if at all, did that change your approach?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, wow, I had 220 front edge and I was debating whether to have a go in two, and obviously when I saw Greg miss his putt, I completely bailed out of that idea. 
 (Laughter.)
 And I got the 9-iron out and left myself my nice number, a hundred yards and somehow just tried to get it on to the green and did that, and it's so difficult to win a golf tournament let alone a Major Championship and great playing from Greg today. He played fantastic golf the last couple days, and I'm just so thrilled to get over the line. 

 Q. If I got my time zones right, it's around 2:30 in the morning in Ireland. Are they watching?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think they will be watching there will be a few pints of Guinness maybe going down right about now. 
 (Applause.)

 Q. Are the pubs still open, or will they keep them open?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think that they might extend drinking hours a little bit tonight hopefully. 
 (Laughter.)
 My mom's in Spain, so I hope she's watching. If she is, I love you mom. I'll see you very soon. My dad's in the crowd. Obviously a proud moment to have him here. 
 So many great friends here this week, and so many Irish people in the crowd cheering me on and...
 (Applause.)
 I don't know what it is about the Irish, they just seem to get every where, you know, but, yeah I just can't explain how I feel right now, it's amazing.

 Q. You said before this final round, if the golfing gods smile on me, maybe I can come out of here with a trophy. They did.
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I guess this -- I guess they did. I just can't believe how difficult this golf course was. I kept my head down pretty much until about I bogeyed 10, had a little peak at the leaderboard to see what was going on and no one was going crazy. 
 I couldn't believe that it. I really just tried to stay calm on the back nine and I really did. I did a great job of it. There's bogeys out here though doesn't matter how good you play. Mr. Davis sets an unbelievable golf course up. I think every 1-putt really enjoyed the test this week. It was fair. Fair, good golf got rewarded, and bad golf got punished pretty badly.   But I just can't thank the greens staff enough this week. The golf course was wonderful, the marshals, the crowds just everyone involved with the USGA.
 (Applause.)
 What a week.

 Q. Once Dustin Johnson fell back early, and you had the lead, you knew that you had giants like Woods and Mickelson and Els potentially breathing down your neck, but none of them really made a move?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Like I say, this golf course is extremely difficult, and it's very tough to make birdies. You go chasing and you'll make bogeys. Dustin got off to a really bad start. After the way he played yesterday, I thought if the same guy turned up today, he was going to be really tough to beat. 
 But I really just tried to concentrate on my game, and I just can't believe I'm standing here with this thing right now. It's an absolute dream come true. I've dreamed of this all my life, two putts to win the U.S. Open. I couldn't believe I actually had a 20-footer to do that today. And, wow, this thing feels amazing.

 Q. Not only are you standing here with it, but soon your name will be etched on it. Right there. Congratulations?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Thank you.
