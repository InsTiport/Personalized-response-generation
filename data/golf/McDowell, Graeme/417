 Q. You finished with a hole-in-one; you're leader in the clubhouse, when is the last time you leaded against yourself? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I don't think I've ever been leader in the clubhouse and hope somebody comes and breaks me. It is a lot of fun. It's a little bit like an Opening Ceremony for the week, everybody out on the course enjoying themselves and a great week for us to enjoy the atmosphere, as well.

 Q. How is it to use this time here to mingle with the fans and relax before things start? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it's cool, because I mean, this is a great way to kind of get to sign some autographs for the fans. 

 Q. Rory, give us a bit of inside information into how you're feeling. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, you know, I've come in here after Houston and I feel like since last Friday, I've put in a lot of good work and I'm going out there and playing my game and [] I know that certain holes, you just take what you can get and move on. Yeah, I'm looking forward just going out there and enjoying myself. 

 Q. Your thoughts on the hole-in-one?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: A hole-in-one, there's so much luck involved, and I really enjoyed the par 3 just as a way to come out and kind of get used to the atmosphere a little bit out here. It's a great way just to relax, as well and get ready for tomorrow. That's kind of special and that will go into the memory banks as definitely a special moment in my majors career so far. 

 Q. A wedge? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: 52-degree wedge. 

 Q. How far did you have?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: 114. Just trying to make sure I got it past the flag and have a chance on the way back.
