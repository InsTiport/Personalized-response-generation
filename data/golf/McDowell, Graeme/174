 Q.   Here again today and unfortunately on 18, could not get it to go for the first time this week.   What are your thoughts as this one ends?  
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Disappointed obviously with the finish of that game.   Lucky, lucky to even be here today.   But actually played quite nicely most of the day.   It all boiled down to my putter actually let me down.   
I had a chance on 14 for the hole, chance on 15 for the hole, missed a short one on 16.   My luck is going to run out sooner than later.   I've got to take one of those opportunities and I just didn't do it.   Disappointed with that second shot, though, thought I maybe had a chance to come back down and leave me an easier putt than I did.  
Hats off to Victor.   Great player.   Hoping to be on the Ryder Cup team with him.   He's going to be a great part of our team and a huge young new player from Europe and looking forward to seeing how he does tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Elaborate on that point.   There were two or three times late in this match where he hit a very deft pitch shot or chip shot when he had to to keep you from basically putting this match away yourself?  
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Yeah, his short game was very, very good coming down the stretch especially.   The pitch he hit from left of 17, I definitely had the better of the two lies.   He played a fantastic pitch shot there.   
And the one on the last, what a great touch that was.   He's got that little bit of European flare.   He's the first really, really exciting player that France has produced in a few years.   And I think he's one to watch.
