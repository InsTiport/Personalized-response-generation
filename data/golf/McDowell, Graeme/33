 Q.  Not the finish you were looking for?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, frustrating.  I played the back nine fairly poorly this week to be honest with you.  Yeah, yes it is the tougher nine of the two, no doubt about it, but birdie 11 to go 1-under for the day today.  Nothing special, but it's a decent day.   
Bogeyed 12, then I had chances on 13 and 14 which I didn't make.  It's that kind of golf course.  You know, you have to take your opportunities when they come because there's not a whole lot of them.  Hit a lot of great putts today that didn't go in.  You know, bogeyed 15 every day and I bogeyed 18 every day, and that was kind of the story coming in there unfortunately.  I cannot get it in the 15th fairway.  My strike zone seems to be allergic to that fairway and missed it twice on Wednesday, right on Thursday, left on Friday, right on Saturday.  So it has my number, 15, let's just say that.   
All in all, it's not bad golf.  It's just not good enough.  It's a golf course where I can't afford to make too many mistakes and I have to take my opportunities when they come along and didn't do a really good job of that today unfortunately.  I hit a lot of quality shots.  Drove it well most of the day right up until the end.  I thought I hit the 18th fairway there.  I thought I caught the right edge of it and I walked up and I was in the bunker with two feet out of the bunker, so disappointing.   
Like I say, it's not far away.  This course is certainly a game of inches or, you know, 50 yards, however you want to look at it.
