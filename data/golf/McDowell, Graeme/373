 Second Round 65. 10-Under Total. 130  
   
  Q. Reflections on the round, how did you play today?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I made great today again. I think I hit 17 greens in reg. I played solid. Some tight pins today. You couldn't go attacking all the time and you look back, everyone is shooting 10-under par.   
 It's tough not to get frustrated on this golf course because you feel like you should birdie every hole. You have got to make yourself stay patient. It's only Friday, and I had to keep myself under control out there. I mean, I bogeyed 9, and I'm walking down 10 fairway just as Rory holes his second and everyone is making birdies. You feel like you've got to go chasing.   
 But was happy to hang tough and make a few birdies coming in. I'm in great position going into the weekend.  
  
  Q. And at least you know the chances are coming?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, the great thing about this golf course is the front nine is tricky-ish and the back nine offers you chances. You have to control it on the front nine. Have to work out how to play 9th hole, but apart from that, I know I can pretty much birdie every hole on this golf course and the swing is very much under control.  
  
  Q. Did the earth move for you? Where were you with the earthquake?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I didn't hear anything about it. When did that happen?   
  
  Q. You would have been about the 11th or 12th?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Really? I didn't feel it. Were we feeling tremors here?   
  
  Q. A lot of shaking going on.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I had no idea. No idea about that. I birdied 11, 12, 13, so obviously didn't do me any harm.
