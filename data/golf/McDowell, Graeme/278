  GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, disappointed obviously.   To come so far, and Nicolas played solid today.     I can't complain.   The elements played a huge part.   I'm disappointed that they probably came out the winner today rather than the two players. 
It really affected the golf.   It was borderline; borderline, some of the tee box setups,11 and 16, I mean, yeah, I can't get to 16.   I missed my drive a little bit, like 250 back.   Really played into his hands the way he drove the ball; he drove the ball phenomenally well. 
And I'm taking nothing away from Nicolas, he played fantastic golf.   He's got a great wind game and he's a fantastic talent, and I got beat by the better man this afternoon. 

Q.   Tough conditions and a tough match. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, sums it up pretty well.   I ran into a guy who is a hell of a player.   He drove the ball fantastic today.   Really killed me off the tee box, and flighted his irons fantastic.   It was tricky out there today.   Disappointing perhaps that the elements came out the winner this afternoon. 
It was very difficult for us to play quality golf, and you know, I would have preferred‑‑ I would have preferred to get beat with birdies as opposed to pars, but that's just the way the course was set up this week in these elements and it is what it is.
.   Like I say, taking nothing away from Nicolas, fantastic player and he deserves this win. 

Q.   You're a man from Portrush who is used to playing in the wind and yet you had to back off so many shots today?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   When you're playing a wind that's gusting‑‑ it felt like it was gusting 30, 40‑mile‑an‑hour at times.   It's very, very difficult when you play a golf course this tight, and greens this exposed, it's just kind of a bit of a leveller.   That's the only way I can describe it.   But he had to deal with the same elements I had to deal with, and that's life.   I didn't play my golf ball as well as he did, and like I say, I stand here very disappointed, but I'm very happy the way I've played this week. 
I played fantastic this morning and I played fantastic yesterday morning.   I struggled on the greens all week.   And you know, in conditions like those today, you've got to putt well, you know what I mean.   I just really have not felt good on the greens this week and didn't deserve to win.

Q.   You looked more rattled than we normally see you at times?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I was rattled by the elements, you know.   Very difficult to stand there and pick your shots because you're‑‑ you're going in there to hit putts and you're trying to hit them quick before the next gust comes along and that's no way to putt.   You can't have your normal routine because you're just trying to hit it quick.   It's tough.   And you know like I say, I was more rattled by the elements.   I certainly wasn't rattled by pressure or any of that kind of stuff.   I was literally struggling to pick my golf shots.
