   GRAEME McDOWELL: It was trickier today, the golf course, a bit of breeze across. It really made you think a little bit.
 But like I was saying there, just didn't lit it in the fairway often enough it today, and you know, I've been getting some pretty big flyers out of the rough lately and it's pretty tough to control your ball coming into these greens from the rough.

 Q. Your frustration levels, are they back to where they should be? Are they zero or close enough?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think I'm in a better frame of mind than I have been in the last couple of months. Talked about putting too much pressure on myself and trying too hard, all of the above. 
 I feel like I'm over that. I feel like The Open Championship was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I realised I don't need to be getting that sort of hyped up and pepped up. You have to lower your expectations a little bit. Work hard and just go out there and let it happen. 
 It's been good to come here this week and be here in the Irish Open in front of the home fans and just chill out a little bit and enjoy my golf.

 Q. Is that the kind of thing that you're conscious of; when you have the double bogey on the third, you mentioned yourself you have had a few poor rounds which ruined the week's work. Is that the kind of thing that you've been working on and thinking of?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I've been guilty of reacting to a double-bogey like that in the past, and when you do have a little setback, like I say, you overreact, and yeah, that's part of the whole process of accepting mistakes because you're going to make them out there, and really getting -- steadying the ship and playing the next hole like you've just made birdie, as opposed to double. So it's important that I get my mental focus correct.

 Q. Looking at the next two weeks, heading to the States, obviously huge events, you're going to go there in a fairly upbeat mood?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, absolutely. Firestone is a great golf course. All about driving the ball well. It's a great week's preparation, if nothing else, for the US PGA. I'm very upbeat about the way I'm playing. And I'm hitting a lot of quality-looking golf shots. I just need to clean everything up a little bit. It's very close. 

 Q. And your comments on the week overall, Killarney, the venue, the course?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It's been fantastic. Apart from the shower today, we've had great weather, great scoring conditions. They have put on a good show for us here. The crowds have come out in the thousands and they have just been fantastic. 
 So all we need to give them is a home winner tomorrow and it will be mission accomplished. This is really just about putting the Irish Open back on the map this week.

 Q. And what is the plan for the next two weeks? You mentioned six fairways today. Is it to hit the range and work on that specifically? What do you think is the best way to approach the next few days? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I've got to control my ball flight, really. I've gone from drawing the ball a couple of weeks ago to nearly fading the ball now, so I need to really look at what my ball shape is right now and I just go out and play with it. At the minute, I'm hitting a great fade but I'm a bit scared of the left side of the course and it shouldn't be like that. I should be aiming it down the left and really trusting my shape. 
 So I'm close, like I say, I've just got to pick a shot and start going with it.

 Q. How did you play today?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Kind of a bit like Thursday really. Just missed too many fairways again, just cold on the greens still, these greens have me seriously confused. Cannot read them, whatsoever. But I'm hitting a lot of good shots. 
 So I'm feeling very positive about the way I'm playing still. Like I say, just didn't hit it in the fairway today. I think I only hit six fairways and really can't play this course in the rough, getting a lot of flyers and very tough to control coming into the greens. 
 Yeah, wasn't quite what I had in mind unfortunately.

 Q. Looked a bit windy and of course the rain eventually came down. Wouldn't be the Irish Open without a bit of rain on one of the days at least. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Felt more like the Irish Open on the last few holes for sure. Decent little breeze across the course this morning which made it a lot trickier. I.
 Got off to a decent start, birdied the first and made a bit of a mess of the third hole, hung in there. But I was kind of in or around par today and careless 3-putt on 11 just hurt me a little bit. Like I say, all in all the game is there or thereabouts and just got to go out and go low tomorrow now. 

 Q. It's the birthday and all that today?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Correct. 32 years old today. Feeling every bit of it. 

 Q. Are you going to go out tonight and have a drink?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think I'm going to have a bit of dinner in Killarney with my family tonight and spend a bit of time with them, and who knows, I might have a celebratory pint.
