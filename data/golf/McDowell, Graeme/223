Q.   Made the turn 6‑under par, and I'm thinking, going to make a move here.   You did get the birdie at 18, but frustrated by that or happy with it?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   A little bit.   I felt a little off my game today.   I couldn't seem to quite get it going.   Just trying to force the issue.   Kind of 15 feet all day, couldn't make anything.   A little frustrated by it.   Obviously I saw the great start that a lot of guys were getting off to, and very benign conditions, that overnight rain kind of softened the greens, and just couldn't quite get it going.   Nice to slip one in the last there.   Going into tomorrow with half a chance.   I hope the greens get a chance to firm up tonight, and maybe a little breeze across the course tomorrow.

Q.   If anyone looked at your body reaction after your followthrough on 18 on the second shot you would have thought, he really doesn't like this, then it almost went in?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, it was kind of one of those ones, I looked up at it and said, oh, there it is.   It's one of those looks, like where has that been all day? 
A little frustrated out there today.   Didn't quite strike it as pure as I have the last couple of days, but hung tough, and half a chance going into tomorrow.

Q.   Let's talk about the weather tomorrow.   Winds could kick up to some 35 miles an hour.   Your thoughts on how that would play out here? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   That sounds good.   I like the sound of it.   This golf course is tricky the best of times, but put a stiff breeze across it and it will really test us.   If I'm going to be four or five behind this leader going into tomorrow, I'll need a bit of breeze.   I'll need something to keep us all honest.   Fingers crossed.   Nice to be going into a Sunday afternoon with half a sniff, anyway. 

Q.   Tell me about your round and a great finish here. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, frustrating today, I didn't strike it as purely as I have the last couple of days.   It's nice to birdie the last.   Makes dinner taste good, that old clichÃ©.
It was benign conditions today.   The overnight rain had softened the putting surfaces a little bit and made the course a little bit more accessible.   But I think we'll get strong winds tomorrow.   If I'm going to be four or five behind the leader, that's exactly what I'm going to need to have a chance tomorrow.
This is a fun event.   Excited to be in the mix going into tomorrow afternoon.

Q.   Does it give you an advantage with the winds tomorrow?   Do you hope the winds pick up?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It doesn't give me an advantage.   Yeah, I'm a decent wind player, but there are a lot of good wind players out here.   I think what it does is it keeps everyone honest.   Today I'd call it a fairly level playing field.   There was 64s and 65s out there today.   That's not what we expect on this golf course; we expect a tougher challenge.   A tough challenge tomorrow will separate the men from the boys.   The guy who wins it will earn it. 
Today it was benign.   If you played well you could really score.   Charley Hoffman must have gotten off to a phenomenal start.   I got a little frustrated with myself.   I couldn't quite get it going.   But we'll see.   I'm nicely positioned.   Excited about tomorrow. 

Q.   When you don't play your best, but you put yourself in position right in the hunt for tomorrow, are you excited about tomorrow, and chomping at the bit to get back out there?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I felt great the last couple of days.   Like I say, couldn't quite put my finger on why I was a little off color today, but these things happen.   It's golf.   The same guy doesn't show up every day; we wish he could.   Hopefully the guy that's played the last couple of days will show up tomorrow.   I need to get my putter heated up.   I haven't putted these greens the way I know I can.   Hopefully I can save it for tomorrow.

Q.   Even though you're in contention, how much more relaxing is this week after the Masters, comparing the two tournaments?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, this is really a fun week.   Obviously I'm part of Team RBC, and I've kind of got a couple of commitments this week.   But it's a really, really chill, laid‑back week, especially coming off the back of last week.   Renting a beautiful house on the beach and got some friends and family here, and we are really quick kicking back.   It's a workweek, but it's no hard workweek.   It's just show up, warm up, play, get your job done, go back and get your feet up and enjoy the views and have some family time.

Q.   What kind of chill moments have you had?   Do you walk barefoot on the beach?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   My warmups in the morning have kind of been on the beach, actually.   Just light running along the beach and run barefoot.   When I say "warmup", I'm using that in the loosest form of the expression available.   A light jog.

Q.   This tournament has kind of a party vibe going all week?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It sounds like it's heating up back there.   Obviously we've got some business tomorrow.   I'll be staying out of the party atmosphere.   I've got some friends and family, been cooking in every night.   A glass of wine and enjoying life. 

Q.   This is one of your favorites?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   This sweet end of the deal the fact that I'm one of RBC's ambassadors.   I'm doing a few bits and pieces.   And obviously the Canadian Open is in my schedule. 
This is a great event.   Some great champions here.   A great golf course.
