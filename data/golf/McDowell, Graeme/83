Q. Your thoughts?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I mean it was very difficult today.  Started off on the back, and 10 was playing really tough, 11, and 13.  I kind of hung tough through those early holes and then made a few birdies.
It was a weird wind today.  It really didn't feel like it helped us much.  It crossed us and felt like it was hurting a lot.
The front nine, allegedly one of the easiest front nine holes on the PGA TOUR didn't play very easy I didn't think.  I missed a couple fairways, hung tough, and couldn't seem to make enough birdies coming in.
All in all, I'm really happy with 4-under par out there today.
Q. I would think given the ball flight that you possess these conditions would be right in your wheelhouse.
GRAEME McDOWELL: I've been living in Florida too long.  I don't have the wind game I used to have.  It's in there somewhere.
I drove it better today than I have been doing.  It's nice to get in some fairways where I feel like I can free swing it.  I feel like I have been playing events like Mayakoba and Hong Kong and Turkey where I have been staring at the driver a little bit and losing my confidence.
Free swung it today, hit some nice drives.  Iron play good coming into the greens, and I feel great on the greens with a putter.
So nice position going into the weekend.  I'm really, really happy and feeling nice and relaxed out there this week.  Looking forward to being in contention hopefully come Sunday.
Q. Share the work you've done on the golf swing.
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's really just been first few feet of my back swing.  It gets quick and it gets picky.  I've really been trying to get it a little bit (plane interference.)  Keeping that transition as smooth as I possibly can.
You know, same old stuff really.  As you know, the golf swing doesn't change much over the years.  The same old bad habits creep in.  They've just hurt me a little bit more early in the year than they normally do.
So taking me back to basics and hitting them much better.
