 Q.  You were very pleased with your play yesterday with a 68.  How do you feel about today with a 69?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Didn't play as well today to be fair.  You see the low scoring happening on this golf course yesterday and you get here, and I felt like the first nine holes, we started on the back and I felt it like it was kind of tricky.   
It was tough to get the ball close to the flag and couldn't kind of get it going and then the frustration starts to set in because benign conditions, you're not going to get these golf courses any easier and you have to try to do your best to stay as patient as you possibly can.   
I hung in there.  I hit some good shots on my second nine holes, and managed to make a couple putts coming in.  So happy enough.  My playing partner, AP, he likes to just keep it on the rail on the inside, middle of the pack, going into the last couple rounds, so he's happy with my position.  We'll take it.   
There's no event quite like this one.  Dunhill do such a fantastic job, so many good people here, good friends and people that I've got to know over the years, and these golf courses are a pleasure to play.  Like I say, it can get frustrating this event, because you know you should score, and like I say, staying patient is one of the big things I work on this week, and you know, for me, this would be a really nice weekend to compete.   
I'm really looking forward to, like we've talked about, 2016 and making The Ryder Cup Team and this would be a really, really good step in the right direction to try and be here, back nine, St. Andrews on Sunday afternoon.  But like I say, this is such a fun week.
