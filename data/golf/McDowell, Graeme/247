 Q.   After you holed that putt, I heard you say to a close friend:   The Ryder Cup, do you like it; that match is the essence of The Ryder Cup.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, that was my girlfriend, Kristin; that was her first experience of a match at The Ryder Cup, and I just said to her, "Welcome to The Ryder Cup, hope you enjoyed yourself."   
That match to me just personifies The Ryder Cup.   Myself and Rory played some great golf to go 3‑up, and then you're playing against two very gutsy players who clawed their way back to all‑square coming down the last two holes.   
I'm not sure if you'll play two tougher holes, I mean, the finish to this golf course is very strong and we had stacked our team with this finish in mind.   I wanted Rory hitting the tee shots on 16 and 18 and our strategy paid off.
