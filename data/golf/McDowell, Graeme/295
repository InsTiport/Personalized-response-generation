 Q.   Quick thought on the round.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Good solid day.   First nine holes I hit it beautifully again, and was a bit quiet on the greens again.   But like yesterday, I thought, here we go again.   I drove the ball fantastic.   Obviously the new Cleveland driver in the bag today and the first nine holes, I didn't miss a shot with it.   I drove it beautifully.  
Back nine I was a little off.   I missed a few fairways and when you start missing fairways on this golf course, it will beat you up.   I made a couple of bogeys coming in, but strong; to birdie 8 and 9 to finish the day.   
Very happy with the way I'm hitting it and very positive start to the season really.   I've exceeded my expectations with regards to how I'm swinging the club and how I'm hitting it and I'm a little ahead of where I thought I was.   
It's nice.   I just need to get hot on the greens this weekend.   
   
 Q.   It can be difficult sometimes with a new golf club, but it seemed to work all right with the driver.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I drove it okay.   I wouldn't say‑‑ I just don't know enough about the driver yet.   I don't know what my misses are with it.   When I hit it good, I hit it really good.   It's probably a bit longer than my old driver and flies a bit better.   I just need to gain a little bit of control with it.  
It was a positive rather than a negative today, the driver, for sure.   
   
 Q.   Just don't miss it.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Exactly.   Don't miss it.   Don't hit bad ones.
