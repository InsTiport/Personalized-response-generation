 Q.   All in all, wasn't a bad round considering?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Relatively speaking, 1‑over par was okay.   It's not going to sort of make any inroads into the leaderboard unfortunately.   The leaders played sort of four or five holes in the bad stuff and most of us had to play a lot more golf than that.   
But you can't complain.   The leaders have earned their position in this field, out last, and that's just the way it kind of goes.  
Links golf is so much about weather.   It can affect the golf course much more so than any of the American‑type golf or anything around the world.   Links golf is fairly affected by the weather conditions and we saw that today.   
The conditions kind of affected my chances of shooting anything in the red really.   1‑ or 2‑under par would have been great score this morning but wasn't going to do any damage unfortunately.  
   
 Q.   17 seed to be causing plenty of problems this morning?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   They were all hard to be honest with you.   The first five, we had some very heavy rain.   You've got to make your score the first five, and I didn't do that.   I played the first five level par.   Then I made double on 7.   Struggling from there in.   
But 9 and 10, which were birdie chances, you're just trying to survive.   I hit 6‑iron from 140 on one nine.   That's a long‑‑ the rain just stopped on the 14th green right after it hit 3‑wood from 200 yards in the Calamity, and that says a lot about how difficult that was playing.   
I'm disappointed that it's blown me out of the Irish Open a little bit just with the conditions this morning, but like I say, that's life, and all I can do is come back here tomorrow and try to shoot a low one and see if I can get myself back up the leaderboard a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Probably takes a bit of the pressure off as well, the home fans are expecting big things from you guys.   Now that that pressure is moving off, you can relax and enjoy it a bit more tomorrow?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I was fairly relaxed this morning I have to say, but the conditions tightened me up pretty quickly.   It's very difficult when you've played 12 or 13 holes in heavy rain, you lose your rhythm pretty quickly and start steering the ball a little bit and when it drives up, the golf swing is not there.   
But I was relaxed and I was excited about today.   You know, you can't do anything about the weather.   The fans have been fantastic this week, they have came out in the thousands, umbrellas in hands this morning, they couldn't be stopped, they were fantastic, and huge thanks to them for all their support this week.   
   
 Q.   Would it be nice to see PÃ¡draig doing the business out there?   He's right up there.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, absolutely.   It would be fantastic to have an Irish winner this weekend.   Played with PÃ¡draig the first two days this week, and I was impressed by the way he's playing.   So he certainly knows his way around this golf course and no better man for the job.
