 Q. Frustrating finish but otherwise a pretty tidy round, how happy are you?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I played pretty solid, but I'm happy. Left a few shots out there on the greens, but always disappointing to bogey the last. I kind of de-celled on my chip a little bit and what wispy rough snagged me up. All in all good ball striking and hit a lot golf drives and decent iron shots and bodes well for the weekend. A tough crosswind all afternoon there and I was happy the way I played.

 Q. You've been preparing at some of the purest links courses obviously in Northern Ireland that there are, how does that track compare to those? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I mean, I think every links test is slightly different. Like you say, I was lucky to play Royal Portrush for a couple of rounds last week and Royal County Down and off to Royal St. George's on Monday morning; so it's been a nice sort of ten days on links golf courses and just building the preparation up. 
 We are here at The Barclays Scottish Open, of course we want to play well this week but there's all one eye on The Open Championship next week. My links upbringing, the game comes back to me pretty easily, I feel like I click into links mode pretty well. And today was a good test and those cross indicates with, really flighting the ball correctly and getting it up-and-down around the greens.

 Q. I know you have a lot of affection for this championship because it was one of the biggest ones you won in your career, but you and I'm sure other players are pretty happy about the decision to switch to links prior to The Open Championship. How needed was that decision do you think? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, like you say, I do love they haven't. Barclays put a good show on and to win it in 2008, that was a big win for me. Of course we miss Loch Lomond. Loch Lomond was a fantastic venue, but to come to a links golf course the week before The Open Championship is very special. 
 I mean, hopefully we will continue to attract the kind of field we have got this week. It's a great boost for the tournament and Castle Stuart is proving to be a really, really great golf course and an enjoyable golf course to play and a great place to come and hone the skills and get ready for next week.
