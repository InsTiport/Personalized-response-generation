 Q. Tough day, wasn't it?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it was tricky conditions out there today. Tee-to-green I played okay to be honest with you, apart from the last. I just couldn't get the grips of the greens as all. They are new. They are just not quite settled and I just didn't put them very well. 
 So I threw a lot of shots away on the greens, around the turn, especially, I 3-putted 9 and missed a short one on 10. I just couldn't make anything. Just frustrating day really considering the way I struck the ball, drove the ball really well, and I hit some decent looking iron shots. 
 Just couldn't get it going at all, and you know, middle of the fairway on the last, you're trying to help, a bit of a cut in there and caught it thin and hit it in the water and bogeyed. Rough day really.

 Q. Did you have expectations of playing better this week, because Sawgrass was almost ten out of ten in terms of your game for most of the week, you said it was around eight out of ten this week.
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, of course I had better expectations than that. But the week is only beginning. It was a tricky day today. You know, a couple of shots better might have made it a little bit more acceptable, but it's disappointing. Just means I've got to shoot 4- or 5-under par tomorrow, get myself back in the mix and I don't see, you know, obviously Luke shot 7-under today. He was magnificent today. Has been for a long time. He's amazing how he can keep it going. Apart from -- I really don't see anyone going crazy this week, you know, with the conditions, as firm as the place is. If I can get it to high single figures by the weekend, I mean, that's got a great chance.

 Q. Is it just one of those days then that this golf course will punish you on one of those days more than others?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: For sure. In conditions like this, you have to putt well and I didn't putt well today at all. I struck the ball well enough today to shoot 68, 69. I mean, realistically, you know, I missed a short one on 17, hit it over the back of 16 with a wedge in my hand, missed a short one on 17 and hit it in the water on the last. It was just a funny day really. 
 I struck the ball great today no, complaints. This place is just so firm and just so hard to get the ball close to the hole. You know, I know they are forecasting a bit of rain but the golf course is unbelievably firm and solid and like I say, you've got to putt well and I just didn't do that. 
 Greens are firm a lot firmer than the fairways. It's tough and tricky, the downwind holes are not nearly as hard as the into the wind holes. It's just very tough to get the ball, 14, the par 3, up the hill, it's nearly impossible to hole that on the back tissue. It's a tricky setup.
