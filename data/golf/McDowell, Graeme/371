  Fourth Round 68. Total 261 (-19)  
   
  Q. Verdict, please.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, cold start. Putter was generally just cold today. Missed the fairway right on 1. Had a hampered second shot and made bogey there. And made bogey out of the green-side trap on 3.  
 Just when I needed a fast start, I had a slow start, and chasing from there really. Played great the rest of the day. Like I say just a bit cold on the greens. They got a little grainier this weekend and as the pins got tougher and tougher; it was tough to make putts.   
 But you know, another great week, I have to say, I'm taking some great form into Dubai next week and that's the key really. I'm feeling as good about my game now as I have all year.  
 22-under par, is that he finished; but I put myself behind the 8-ball from the word go today and Ian was cruising home. He played beautiful around the turn and he hit some magnificent looking shots and he was going to be a tough man to catch, especially after my short.  
  
  Q. Some scoring by him, isn't it.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, 22-under is a fantastic return on any golf course. That's better than 65 average that; 64.75 average is pretty solid, shall we say. You know, he's a great player, great to see him back in the winner's circle here in Europe. Obviously he won the Match Play earlier in the year but he's a top player and great to see him playing well again.   
 Personally, I'm very happy with my week, disappointed with my start, but no disappointments in general this week. Very happy with my form and very happy with the energy levels going into Dubai next week.  
  
  Q. I take it with the money involved this week, that's closing the gap even more, and all the more significant.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Of course. I'm within touching distance now of next week. I've got to play well next week, simple as that. Martin, I can't control his ball; I can only control mine. I'm going to go in there next week and try to play my own game. I have a few things to brush up on before Thursday, but all in all, I'll driving the ball great, which is key to next week and I'm feeling really good, feeling really good about my game. I'm playing well enough to win next week and that's all I can ask.  
  
  Q. Relaxed or a little edgy?   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Very relaxed. A bit edgy after the start more because I knew I had to come out of the blocks and I didn't. I'm very frustrated and I'm relaxed and feeling great about things. Let's be honest, it's been a great year and anything that happens next week is going to be a bonus. I'm just going to go there and play calm and confident golf.
