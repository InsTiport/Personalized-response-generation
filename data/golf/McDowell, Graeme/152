 Q.   A little disgruntled with the swing, what was going on out there?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, didn't have much pressure on the golf ball today.   Hit it much much better yesterday.   You know, I've really been working on trying to get through the ball.   I was kind of getting a bit body first today and leaving the club behind and didn't really have much sequence going on in my swing.   
Found it a little bit coming in thank goodness, last five or six holes, I hit the ball better.   But yeah, ball‑striking was a little dodgy out there today.   
   
 Q.   Talk us through the par3, was that a pull or a go‑at?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   The boys showed me 6‑iron was a perfect club for me.   They kind of hit little ones and it was too much and they are a bit longer than I am.   
Coming off the back of making bogey on 1 from position A11 with a wedge on my hand, I suppose I did go flag hunting a little bit.   It was a perfect number and a nice way to bounce back after bogey on 1.   
   
 Q.   Put into context Kevin Stadler's score, 12‑under on the last.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I said to Martin Kaymer, it was nearly as good as him at Pinehurst No.2 but not quite.   
No, great display of golf.   Kevin's obviously played a lot of golf here on The European Tour, so he's very comfortable here.   Comes over, always performs well.   His type of golf course, fairways ask greens.   He keeps playing that, he's going to be tough to catch.   
But I feel like 3‑under par is not a bad sort of return for the last two days, and if I can go low tomorrow and get myself back in it, who knows, but having a lot of fun out there, great crowds with Victor and Martin.   It's been a good two days.
