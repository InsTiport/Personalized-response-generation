McDOWELL:  It's the same number as yesterday.  But I probably hit the golf ball a little bit better today.  I think I had seven chances from inside 20 feet in the first nine holes, made none of them.  I actually hit great putts.  I really felt like I rolled the ball well all day today.  I had more looks than I've had in a long time in a round of golf.  Yeah, I can't be disappointed.  I really felt like I played well today.  I drove it well, hit my irons solid, rolled the pole pretty well.
Q.  Some days you hit the ball sideways, hole a lot of putts, shoot 72, but would you take a 72 when it's a potential 67 or 68?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  Obviously I'm disappointed with it.  I hit the ball well enough to have walked off with 67 or 68 very easily.  That's really the number I needed to get myself back into this golf tournament really.
Q.  But this is a major and you're playing well so can you take something out of it?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yeah, but this golf course is yielding a ton of chances, and when you only make one birdie out there, I think it's a disappointment when you strike the ball the way I struck it today.  I'm not drawing on the positives really.

I've got a nice stretch of events coming up, and I'm really happy the way I'm playing.  I'm feeling good, I'm feeling positive and I'm just excited about the next three, four weeks.
