  GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I felt like I controlled the ball well most of the day.   You know, left a few on the greens the first 12 holes and things kind of got a little ugly for a couple holes.   
Pulled one of those lies on 13 which I kind of would have rather if it had been a really bad lie and made me chip it out, but instead it was a bit of a teaser.   I was surprised it didn't fly the hazard.   Made a great save there and obviously when I hit someone on the next, thankfully he was okay.   It wasn't the best header in the world.   It went the opposite direction.   It was a bad break for me but a worse one for him and apologies to him if he's watching.  
All in all a good recovery.   Solid start.   Looking forward to getting back out in the morning.  
   
 Q.   You holed a couple of good putts for bogey.   How do you guys do that when you are feeling frustrated and disappointed and yet you hole a great putt?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, my head was spinning pretty good on the par5 I have to say when I was standing over the 12‑, 15‑footer coming back for bogey.  
I don't know.   Managed to stay focused and knock that one in and sort of pull myself back together really.   Made a few decent swings coming down the stretch.   It's a tough finish to this golf course.   15, 17 and 18, especially, really tough holes here.   The front pin on 17 and 18 are impossible to get at.   Happy to finish with a two and a couple fours.   Good day's work.   
On 16, my two playing compatriots hit beautiful shots in there, and I figured if I bailed out, I'd look a little silly.   It was a perfect number for me.   My playing partners hit 8‑irons and it was a perfect 7‑iron for me.   I was able to hit a nice draw, hold against the wind.   Three very nice shots in there.
