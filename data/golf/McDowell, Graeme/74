 Q.  A positive start but in the end, too many bogeys?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Too many mistakes.  I got off to the dream start, birdied 1 and 3 and had 20 feet for eagle on 4.  Kind of summed up my day a little bit, the 3-putt on 4.  Haven't really been seeing the greens very well this week.  Too many mistakes on the greens today and just sort of pushing a little bit too hard coming in.   
Disappointing.  I've really enjoyed the week.  Just going to have to go out there and really shoot a low one tomorrow and see if I can finish with a little bit of style.  Wasn't really what I had in mind after the start today.   
 Q.  The Irish Open is a week you look forward to.  Plenty of good support?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it's fantastic.  Great to see the people.  Obviously with Rory and Danny Willett at the top of the leaderboard, the crowds have come out big today and supporting all the boys and Shane had a big group there early, as well, as did I.  It's fantastic and we love coming back.   
Like I say, it's a little extra disappointment because you don't perform because you want to, but it's all good.  The game's there.  I'm really happy where I'm at and just got to do a little grinding this afternoon and come back tomorrow.   
 Q.  A good start out there.  
GRAEME McDOWELL: I birdied 1 and 3, but the three putts on 4 knocked the wind out of my sails and missed the green on 5 and made bogey.  From having the dream start, I was walking to the 6th tee rather frustrated with things.   
Continued to play a bit frustrated the rest of the day.  I haven't really had it on the greens this week.  I haven't really been seeing them very well.  I had two or three 3-putts and caught up with me in the end a little bit.   
Disappointing, because I'm really enjoying the week, great support out there.  Golf course has been fun to play.  Weather has been reasonably kind to us, as well.  Of course I'm disappointed but I'll be working hard this afternoon and this evening to be able to come out fresh and shoot a low one tomorrow.   
 Q.  Going to do a bit of work on the putting green, do you think?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: I could do with doing a little work on the putting green, yeah.  My full swing wasn't quite at the races today, as well.  So a little bit of work on everything and just physically try to feel a little bit better tomorrow in the body.  Love to finish with a low one.   
 Q.  Great support out there?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: It's fantastic.  Shane was off early and looked like he had a big crowd with him and I had great support, as well, and the leaders with Danny and Rory and the boys.  The crowds are great and came out in masses today and really made us proud and we're proud to be here.   
 Q.  Rory's up at the top, I know you would rather it be you, but how good would it be to have a home winner this week?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: It would be great.  Everything that Rory's did for this tournament, for him to be able to win this would be a bit special.  It would really help the tournament go from strength to strength, where it's already going.  I'd love to be up there myself but got to work a little harder.
