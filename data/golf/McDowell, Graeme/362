 Q. Just talk about your round. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Not my best ball-striking day today. Played great yesterday, had it on a string, and today I wasn't quite sure where it was going to go. But hung tough, and sometimes in sort of a four-round tournament you get a round where you don't really play your best. To shoot 3-under and not play my best, I'm pretty happy with that. 
 Looking forward to the weekend. It's a great event. Really enjoy the format here, pretty relaxed, and some great players on the golf course. The golf course is wonderful, as always.

 Q. Feeling sharp still or a little groggy?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: No feeling good. I mean, feeling good. Better as the days go on, really. The jet lag kind of gets shook off as the week goes on, and I'm feeling better and better. I'm still waking up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning. It started 2:30, gone to 3:00, gone to 4:00 now, so a couple of days and I might get a decent night's sleep tonight, who knows.

 Q. What's been the strong part of your game this week?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm actually holing out well. My speed was awful today. I've generally been -- my iron play has been pretty strong, giving myself plenty of chances when I do get the ball in play. I like this golf course. I love the way the greens set up here, and you feel like you can make those eight-, ten-footers, the greens are so pure here.
