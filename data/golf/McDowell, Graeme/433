   GRAEME McDOWELL: I wasn't following -- like I said, I wasn't following the leaderboard. I was trying to get my job done. I played some really nice stuff. Even when I was on the bogey train, I felt I was getting decent shots. Got myself out of position couple times and paid the price.

 Q. You've had a lot of experience in the majors now. Over the last six majors you've been top 20 four times. You had a chance here to get Top 10 at least and maybe even beyond that. What would satisfy you?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, Top 10, Top 5, something along those lines would be a nice weekend performance. But I'm just trying to regroup. Like I said, it was a tough day, very mentally demanding, and like I said, trying to regroup for tomorrow. Try and go post 4 or 5 tomorrow and see what happens on Sunday.
