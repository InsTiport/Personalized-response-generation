   GRAEME MCDOWELL: He played solid golf. He was a tough man to beat today and to be brutally honest, I was frustrated with my game all week. I hit a lot of average shots for me. I was really trying to find -- bizarrely, today was probably the best way I felt. I hit some decent shots today. I just couldn't quite get the job done.   
 But that's the way this week goes, really. Some days you play all right and run into the guy that plays great. I would have had to be on my game to beat him.  
  
  Q. A few weeks off, maybe you weren't expecting to feel --  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: I practiced really well Saturday, and Sunday at Lake Nona. But when I game here, my game swing didn't seem to be there Monday and Tuesday. And struggled a bit Wednesday and Thursday and sneaked through. Worked very, very hard every day trying to find it. It was a bit better today, but I've got some work to do before next week.  
  
  Q. You've gone further than you've ever done, and obviously taken Tiger in the World Rankings?  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: Absolutely. A lot of positives to take away from the weekend. It was my best ever performance in this tournament. Not saying much for me. But I really enjoyed the week. It's great to get my confidence up on this event, where I'll not be so scared of it next time and look forward to teeing it up next week.  
  
  Q. Another WGC in two weeks time?  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: Yeah, I'm playing Honda, Doral, the the Tavistock Cup in Orlando and Bay Hill and getting ready for the The Masters. I feel like I'm getting back into my season again after four weeks break. I'm just gearing back up and I'm excited about things.  
  
  Q. When are we going to see you back in Europe?  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: The first one back to me will be the Volvo Match Play in Wentworth in Wales. I'm playing most of the summer in Europe. Obviously a busy swing at the end of the season.
