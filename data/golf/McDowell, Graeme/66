Q. I appreciate this won't be the result that you want, but how do you assess this week at Castle Stuart?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, really happy with the way things are kind of trending.  I hit the golf ball really well this weekend, especially hit all the shots today.  Just I wasn't tight enough around the greens this weekend.  Chipping and putting let me down this weekend.  Really tee-to-green, I couldn't fault the way I played the first 15, 16 holes, really.  Hit a lot of good shots.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities.
You know, sometimes when you've gone from very difficult conditions like Thursday and Friday, to benign conditions to where you know you should be scoring, tough to make that mental adjustment.  I don't think I did that well this weekend, when conditions were a bit easier and birdies were a little easier to get; I didn't adjust mentally.
Will you listen, really, really happy the way I'm progressing and looking forward to taking some good form into next week.
Q. And good enough to know the game is in good shape for Royal Troon?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I hit the ball fantastically this weekend.  I was really happy the way I drove the ball.  My ball shaping is back.  I've got a nice fade back in the bag which I really need for Troon next week and working on a couple small shots that I'll need off the tee for next week.
Listen, I would have loved to got a little closer today and disappointed that I didn't, but we'll reset, get over to Troon and look forward to the challenge.
