  Q. Probably the same questions, 63, 7-under. Great way to head into next week with a good frame of mind.  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: For sure. It's always good to have a confidence booster ahead of next week. I've been playing well for awhile. It's nice to get the numbers. It's my best finish of the season which is key, you know, you like to get some rewards for how you're playing and nice to post 63 on the weekend.  
  
  Q. Talk about the condition of the course, certainly probably played a little bit longer than it has the last couple of days.  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: The course held up unbelievably well considering how much rain, the softness, reception. Greens was evened out probably how long the golf course is playing. You're going to want some longer clubs. Greens stayed perfect.   
 I thought the whole week was good, you know. The water obviously stuck a little bit but you expect that this time of year in the middle of the country and I thought the organizers did a great job of getting us out there. We've got a great window to play golf.  
  
  Q. As far as your college background, going to school at UAB, some of your fans up here this week supporting you or friends that you met while you were in college?  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: Yeah, for sure. I've got a couple of college teammates come to visit me and lot of response from sort of ex-Blazers and guys who realize I was at UAB down the road.   
 Nice to come back though this part of the world and experience some of the heat and humidity that the area sort of provides. But, you know, it's happy hunting ground here obviously for me. I'll be looking forward to coming back. Like I say, thanks to the sponsors and the organizers for giving me the invite in the first place.  
  
  Q. Padraig Harrington, you're part of the people, the Irish, you get a lot of support up North. Lot of Irish people up there?  
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: That guy over there, Mickelson and with Tiger playing so well, I think the atmosphere is going to be ridiculously good outside. Hope the weather is kind to us. I'll be happy to play well and make a bit of the run for the weekend, hopefully.
