 Q.  Nice round to go bogey-free.  
GRAEME MCDOWELL: Yeah, that was nice if I would have walked off there with five on the last -- I mean I did deserve five on the last after that second shot, don't get me wrong -- but it would have been a disappointing day because I did everything right today.  I hit a ton of fairways and a ton of greens, gave myself a lot of looks.  The greens were really slick today coming out of the gate.  That pin on 2 today, I mean middle of the green, if you hit the smart one in there right of the hole, the thing was 20 on the Stimp going down there.  It was really, really slick.  It was tough to -- I'm a pretty aggressive putter and these greens are not allowing aggressive putting.  They're quite slick, there's not a lot of grain on them and there's not a lot of friction on them really and putts can gets away from you quite quickly.  So putting's been tough this week because of the pace of the greens.  I let a few get past me out there today, but to go bogey-free, it's a decent Saturday, very happy with it, would have liked a few more to get myself more in touch, but where my game's at right now days like today are very important for me.
