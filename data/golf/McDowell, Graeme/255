 Q. 14, 15, 16, was frustration picking up?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, very frustrated.   I played myself back into the tournament and had a bit of a bad break on the tee shot on the last there, runs right out into the waste trap, and compound the error from there unfortunately.   I made three 6s on the day, and just frustrating really.   I've been around seven, eight shots in this golf tournament just from around the greens really, just compounding errors, and that's extremely frustrating to do that on the last hole there today and try to hit a hard cut off the left side there, and I just got it riding too much in the wind, and bad break and didn't make it happen from there.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about the challenge this afternoon?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I think conditions today, there's a low score out there for sure, and I'm going to have to play aggressively this afternoon.   Not much wind.   The greens are pretty receptive, and they're great surfaces.   So I've just got to go reset, come back out, come back out firing really.   I'm hitting enough good shots.   I'm hitting a lot of quality shots.   Just careless efforts around the greens.   I made 6 from the edge of the green on 7 twice this week, and two double bogeys there this morning, very disappointing.   Wrong club on 12.   The last was just kind of one of those things, really.   But we'll be back this afternoon.
