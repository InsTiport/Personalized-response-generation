 Q. You join a very special band of people to get to hole the winning putt in Ryder Cup, tell us how it felt?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Well, I never actually got to hole it, I didn't need it, thank God. I mean, I just can't describe the feeling of this golf tournament. Trying to win it for your 11 other teammates, the caddies, the fans here have just been unbelievable; Monty, Europe, it's a special feeling. There's nothing quite like it.

 Q. How did the pressures compare to coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open coming down the stretch here with all your teammates here and the whole of Europe?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: The U.S. Open felt like a back nine with my dad back at Portrush compared to that. I was really nervous there. I was nervous, wow. It's a different feeling. It's just so much pressure. 

 Q. There's always a key moment, a turning point, talk us through the putt at 16, the roar was just deafening. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: 16 was massive. These guys (fans) are massive. You know, fast putt, I just had to get it going. Thankfully it caught an edge. Wow. It was the best putt I've hit in my life. 

 Q. I suppose we'd better say a bit about these guys, these fans are very significant?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: These fans are amazing to get out here every morning to get out walking around in the mud. I love them. I love them a lot. We needed them. We needed them big time. 

 Q. Tell us about your captain, Colin Montgomerie, he's not prepared to take any credit because he didn't hit any shot. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: He's been amazing. For the last two years he's been right up for this, there's nothing quite like Colin Montgomerie. He's everything there is in The Ryder Cup and to be able to do that for him today was really special. 

 Q. Congratulations, Graeme McDowell. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Thank you.
