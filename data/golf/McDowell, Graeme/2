Q. I guess it's a tough way to finish but overall a pretty good day. 
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I mean, listen, it's never any fun to finish like that. I missed one fairway today, and that's the one on 9, and I pulled a horrendous lie under a branch for my second shot and I could only manage to putt it out of there and left myself on the downslope in the rough and made 6 from there, after what was a fast start. I got a mud ball on 10 my first hole, hit it in the right trap, and then I got a mud ball again on 13, laid it up in the hazard. And then I threeâputted 15 for a par. I was kind of reeling at that point a little bit, but rescued the day. Birdied 16 and then really played quite solidly after that. I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of quality shots. Like I said, disappointed to finish like that, but lots of positives to take into tomorrow. I mean, the golf course is certainly as soft as you're ever going to see Augusta. It's as gettable as we're ever going to see at this place, and there was certainly a good score to be had out there, I just couldn't quite get the job done. 

Q. What did you do during the break? Did you stay at home and take a little longer to get here? 
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I was fortunate that my tee was such that I knew I was going to have close to an hour. As soon as they decided what the situation was, I was able to get back to the house for a second breakfast and a second warmup and come back and kind of get ready to go. It's always nice to hit the reset when you hang around the locker room or all the fantastic facilities they have for us here. You're out of your normal routine, so it's nice to kind of go back, reset, put a pair of shorts on, kind of warm back up again, put the golf clothes on, and like I say, reset and get ready to go again. 
Yeah, I thought we were very fortunate this morning because conditions looked like we might get the really tough end of the draw this morning, but when we did get out there, it was perfect. No complaints at all. 

Q. You've always talked about how much you love this place, that you absolutely love it here but yet haven't had as much success as you want. What do you have to do to sort of find it tomorrow? 
GRAEME McDOWELL: You know, this is probably as comfortable, I think, as I've ever felt at this golf course. The way I drove it today, I had lots of great looks at iron shots. I've just never had a great putting week here. It's so different. It's so different right now from what we expect, everything from the lack of fans to the softness of this place. It's just November, and it's just kind of Mother Nature. You know, it's still a fantastic golf course, still my favorite. 
I really enjoyed myself out there, to be honest with you. It's so much more chill here, I guess, from the intensity of what the Masters tournament normally is, without a fans. I'm a guy who likes the intensity, I need that, and we're obviously very, very hopeful that we can get them all back in April. 
First and foremost I want to have a great weekend from here. 12th I think is my best Masters finish, and I feel like I'm playing well enough to do better than that this weekend.
