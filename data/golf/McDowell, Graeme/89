 Q.  67 today.  What are your thoughts on that round?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, iron play was much sharper today than it was yesterday.  With the soft conditions, you can really be aggressive coming into the greens.  You have to take your shots on.  My iron play wasn't very sharp yesterday, but much, much better today.  Gave myself some more opportunities.   
 Q.  I joined you at the 5th.  On the 6th, you hit it in there tight.  You said nice to finally get one online.  What was wrong the first five holes?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Like I say, the short iron is in your hand you really feel like you should be taking pins out of the ground.  I steered away from the pin on the third which frustrated me a little bit.  I said to myself after that, that's it, I'm going to start aiming at flags the rest of the day.  I did that.  I was much more aggressive.  Like I say, gave myself some chances and made a few putts.   
It was nice.  Perfect conditions out there.  You couldn't really ask for anything easier than this afternoon and good fun out there with good crowds.   
 Q.  3-under for the par-3s.  What does that say about your iron play?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: It says my iron play is moving in the right direction.  I felt like I shaped the ball around well.  I've really been working hard the last few months, especially on my iron play.  Hitting 4 and 5 and 6-irons with the right shapes and right flights, it's very pleasing.  Moving in the right direction and certainly very happy about that.   
 Q.  On 16, you backed off the ball, was there a finger issue there?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: On the par-5, my second shot, I gripped the club and my middle finger on my left hand felt like it was cramping up a little bit.  It was literally just there and gone in a couple minutes.  Nothing going on there at all.  It was kind of a weird one.
