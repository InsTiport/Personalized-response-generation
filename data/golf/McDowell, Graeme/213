 Q.   Serious note, you want to be playing four rounds here, don't you?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Of course I do.   I was here to do a job this week.   This is a difficult golf course.   Played long.   Greens were tough to putt after a harsh winter here.   Not a happy hunting ground as I've talked about, and today was extremely difficult conditions.   That's probably one of the more brutal rounds of golf conditions‑wise that I've played in a few years, really, and it was tough.   Two birdies in two days, just about kind of sums it up.   
I played some okay golf but just struggled to get it going around this golf course historically and this week was no different unfortunately.   Just disappointed from a European Tour point of view, a BMW point of view, that I'm not going to be here for the weekend.   And with sunshine forecast, I was desperate to be here and play some golf this weekend.   
But same old story around here unfortunately for me.   It is what it is and we'll be back.   Just need to try to see if they can get this tournament played in June or July or something.   I need this golf course with a little fire in it, a little heat.   It's a long old slog for me out there not being able to move it a lot far off the tee when it's this cold and wet.   We'll be back, though.   
   
 Q.   What are your plans now?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Plans, supposed to be going home to Portrush for a couple of days.   Either that or jump on a flight back to Florida this morning, we'll see.   Kristin just arrived this morning, so she'll be happy she flew over.   She made it about six holes out there.   She's got a head cold.   She made it about six holes and ran to the hotel.   I don't blame her.   So go back to the hotel and see what's going on.   
Like I say, I was supposed to be in Portrush Monday.   I might still nip back home for a couple of days and then head state side and get my game ready for the U.S. Open.   
   
 Q.   Up to Merion?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I'm in Merion the Wednesday before the tournament.   A couple of corporate commitments in New York Monday and Tuesday the week before, and then Merion Wednesday and then back to Orlando to prepare and back up again, week off, then Irish Open, French Open, week off, Open.   
So, excited about the next four or five weeks.   It's been a great three weeks.   You know, I'll take missed the cut, win, missed the cut any day of the week, as far as a run of three events.   
Of course I'd like to play more consistently, but when you're making your good weeks count, that's very important, and like I say, I mean, I'm very disappointed to miss the cut this week, but this is a golf course which is a work‑in‑progress for me.   We'll be back.
