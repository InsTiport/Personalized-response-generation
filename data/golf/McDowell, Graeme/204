Q.   Are you hoping that putt at last will keep you here for the weekend? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Of course I am.   You never want to wish any ill on the field but you know, I certainly hope they come back to me.   I didn't play my best the last couple of days.   Yesterday my driver was a little off.   My iron play was sharp.   Today my driver was on and my iron play was a little off. 
I putted badly today.   I couldn't get the speed of the greens.   They were very slow, and I think in anticipation of this wind forecast they really didn't get them all that speedy today, and I left a lot of putts short. 
But all in all, I desperately want to obviously be playing this weekend.   I don't want to miss the cut, of course, at The Irish Open of all weeks.   We'll be anxiously watching the leaderboard this afternoon.

Q.   Are you getting a little frustrated with your game, because one week you seem to be winning and the next you're missing the cut; it seems to be either/or at the moment. 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   There's a little frustration.   I'm a little off technically right now I have to say.   There's nothing wrong with the heat and there's nothing wrong with the body.   It's just the technique.   I'm just not quite on, on, on, on my golf swing. 
I've got some work to do, and 36 holes this weekend will be important for that work.   If I don't get 36 holes under my belt this weekend, I'll be hitting a lot of golf balls on the range and getting ready for next week at The French Open.   It's been a successful season.
You've got to take the rough with the smooth, perhaps a little under‑golfed here the last five, six weeks.   That's the way you've just got to run with it and I'll be working very hard to try to get myself out of this.

Q.   Hopefully you'll be here obviously to play; if you're not, will you stay and practise here?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, the facilities here at Carton House are world‑class, and worst‑case scenario, if I do miss the cut, I'll see myself hitting golf balls here tomorrow and preparing myself for The French Open next week.   I have a long busy summer of golf ahead, but first and foremost, I want to make sure I'm here for the fans at The Irish Open.

Q.   I think you were trying so hard out there, and sometimes it is a case of trying too hard, and you really want to be around the weekend, don't you?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I desperately want to be around for the weekend, no doubt about it.   I don't want to be missing cuts any week, let alone The Irish Open. 
It's been a funny couple of days, because I played okay.   Yesterday my driver wasn't on.   My iron play was pretty good, worked hard on my driver last night on the range, and came out and drove the ball much better this morning, and my iron play was very weak. 
My putter was very weak this morning, as well.   The greens were quite slow in anticipation of strong wind conditions this afternoon.   I don't think they were allowed to get them up to the kind of speeds they would like to, and I couldn't get a putt to the hole to save my life.

Q.   One of those things at the moment, you're playing well some weeks and winning twice in the last three months and then you have a weeks like this and you're speaking of being a little bit off.   This is the filet of the major season; what do you do to get back on?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I work hard.   I get together with my coach and I grind and grind.   It's not far away.   There's just something missing with my setup or my swing, something just technically a little off for me right now. 
I'm looking for that one key that kind of flicks the switch right now, because I know it's not far away.   There's enough good swings in there to kind of keep me into it. 
Like I say, just looking for a little key, a piece of the jigsaw puzzle that seems to be missing right now.   It's there or thereabouts.   I know once I flip that back in, I've proved already this season that I can win, and you know, we have got a lot of great golf coming up.   36 holes this weekend at Carton House would be key, just to really get out there and get that competitive practise. 

Q.   We know from earlier in the week how much this tournament means to you.   Obviously frustrated at the moment?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, there's certainly an element of frustration inside me right now.   Nice to birdie the last to get some of semblance of hope.   You never want to wish anything ill on the field but conditions are tough right now and the wind has really got up and the golf course is a different test. 
The European Tour have done well and bumped some tees forward, making a few of the tough par 4s play slightly easier back into this prevailing wind.   I'll be watching the leaderboard with interest this afternoon.   I really desperately want to be here for the weekend.

Q.   Ten shots off the lead at the moment, does 9‑under par surprise you in terms of guys are shooting that score?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I think so.   I really don't see 9‑under par on this golf course but when you're not playing 100 per cent, it is tough to see the low numbers.   I find this a very tough test of golf.   You've got a lot of long irons in your hand coming in to difficult greens, a lot of heavily‑bunkered golf course. 
Greens were quite slow this morning, just in anticipation of these high winds, and I struggled to adapt to the pace of them.

Q.   What for you has been the most difficult challenge of this course for the past few days?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I found everything fairly challenging to be honest with you.   Didn't drive it great yesterday, but drove it better today.   Iron play was sharp yesterday and wasn't so sharp today. 
This is a good test of golf here at Carton House:   World‑class facility, great golf course, and you've got to drive it good, you've got to hit your irons good and you've got to chip and putt well.   That sounds clichÃ©, that works every week of course, but this is a real ball‑striker's course.
