Q. Are you a happy man?  Two good days, you must be pleased?GRAEME McDOWELL: Of course I am.  Of course I am.  This is what I have been grinding towards the last few months, getting myself on the leaderboard in the weekend, I've missed this.  Fun to be hitting it as solidly as I am. Quieter day on the greens today, but stronger finish than yesterday.  It all adds up to the same.  So I'm happy with where I'm at.Q. When you are rolling them as well as you did at the last, it's nice isn't it?GRAEME McDOWELL: The greens are fantastic here, they really are some of the best surfaces I've seen this year, probably.  They are a nice speed.  You feel like you can be aggressive, but yet you are not having to hit them too hard.  They are a beautiful speed. The golf course is a nice balance test.  You have to drive it well.  You have to do a lot of things well.  If you can find these small targets, you have an opportunity to make some birdies.Q. Any similarities to Portrush?GRAEME McDOWELL: I suppose.  I suppose there is.  Just obviously the grasses and I think the level of tightness off the tee.  Some similarities.  But I think the size of the greens is very similar.  But no, there is a comfort level for me up there.  Certainly enjoying it.Q. You grind and grind, do you have that frustration and the patience all built in, it's going to click?GRAEME McDOWELL: I think if I can get a few tournaments under my belt feeling as good as I am with my game, get that belief level up.  It's still a work in progress, you know.  Second shot to the last there, there's still that grab in the downswing, just not feeling confident enough to take that aim there.  It's still -- we'll chip away at it.  I'm liking what I'm seeing, a lot of quality shots, just got to keep doing it.Q. When you are at the halfway stage in this kind of position, you just (inaudible)?GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, definitely.  I believe it's going to be pretty windy tomorrow.  It's important to be there or abouts, at or around the leaders.  Hopefully we have a nice start to tomorrow and separate the big boys from the (inaudible).  So it should be a lot of fun
