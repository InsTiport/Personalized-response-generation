 Q.  Just give me your assessment of the week at Oakmont.  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it was kind of one of those funny weekends.  I got off to slow starts both rounds.  Kind of happy with myself, I guess, the way I hung in there, especially the last ten holes every day.  I think I played the last ten about 3 under yesterday and the last ten about 2 under today.  So if I could have mastered those first eight holes, I'd have had a decent weekend.  But all in all, some good stuff there.  Really happy with some of the general ball strikes and where my game's at.   
This is a U.S. Open.  It's hard.  It kind of beat me up a little bit.  But definitely taking some good positives out here, and some big stuff ahead of me.   
 Q.  There's a big few weeks coming up for everyone, but for you yourself personally, French Open and various tournaments that you've done well in in the past.  So how much pride do you take from that going forward?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: Like you said, the French Open is a big one on the radar, double Ryder Cup points, and a fantastic field there on a golf course I really like.  Taking some really good form into it.  Not trying to put any pressure on myself.  I do have a lot to do.  I'm trying to stay patient.  I'm trying to stay open minded.  French, Scotland, not in the Open Championship right now, but I'm right on the fringes, hoping to get in that one.  I'll play the Canadian and the PGA as well.  So that's my Ryder Cup run upcoming.  That is a big goal of mine, of course.   
Hopefully, I can just stay patient and keep playing the way I'm playing and let some good stuff get in the way.  I'm looking forward to it.  Quite enjoying my golf at the minute.   
 Q.  We've got quite a few Europeans at the top of the leaderboard.  You kicked this nice run off yourself.  What would it mean for another European to get another victory and particularly Shane, if he can do it?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: I guess being the first Irishman ever to win the U.S. Open, and the first British and Irish player to win in 40 years, it certainly did open the floodgates.  I mean, Rory and Justin since.   
So many great Europeans at the top of the leaderboard.  Pulling personally for Shane, being a very good friend of his.  I've always had a huge amount of respect for his game, his driving and his short game, and just his general will down the stretch.  So I'll be pulling hard for him and would love to see him get the job done for him and for Ireland and all, and obviously for Europe as well.  It would be very special.   
 Q.  For a guy who burst onto the scene by winning the Irish Open, it's been quite a journey for him, hasn't it?  
GRAEME McDOWELL: It has been, but I recognized the talent in his game right in the very beginning right when I met him, after he turned pro and I got to know him a little bit.  He's got just the right amount of confidence and competitiveness.  He's got that will to win.  He's very athletically talented.  He's just one of those guys that's pretty good at most things he does.  He's a great golfer as well.  His short game is probably the best that I've ever seen in the world, as far as his hands go, around on the greens.   
He's got that will to win down the stretch.  He gets the job done when he gets a little sniff of victory, and that's one of those things you just can't teach.  I'll be watching with interest here the next couple of hours hoping he can get it done.
