Q.   Talk about a bogey‑free round of 67?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, very happy with that.   Obviously kind of got here Tuesday morning, haven't really been feeling my best the last couple of days.   My first sort of long trip of the year for me, and the body took a little bit of time to catch up.   Thankfully a couple of night's sleep and I felt much, much better this morning, and energy level has felt good. 
Generally swung the club quite well.   Coming off the back of the Volvo World Match Play a couple weeks ago, I felt my game was in good shape.   Coming in here, obviously looking for a big finish to the season, and that was a nice way to start. 

Q.   A run of three birdies after the turn, that certainly helps?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, always nice.   The golf course is fairly soft, obviously due to the rain.   It's playing very long, but the greens are very receptive and you can attack a few pins. 
I've had a lot of yardage in my hand most of the day out there.   We counted up, I think I had seven iron shots from outside of 200 yards on this golf course.   It's playing long.   Certainly for a guy like me who doesn't hit it maybe as far as some of the other guys, I have to be precise with my iron play and putt well, and I putted well today.   That was one of the keys.

Q.   Is there an excitement about The Final Series, BMW Masters to start, and a lot of incentives? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   For sure.   Especially for a guy like me on the fringe of the bonus pools, I'm in 14th position in The Race to Dubai.   I'm not playing Turkey.   That makes the BMW Masters here in Shanghai a big, key event for me and then into the HSBC next week.   These are two big weeks for me.   I need at least one big finish these two weeks, and if we get off to a good start this week, who knows, it could be a two big finishes.

Q.   Getting enough sleep, everything good at home? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, it was just jet‑lag, nothing else.   Nothing more sinister than a bit of jet‑lag.   A long trip over here from Florida.   Baby's good, mom's good and life's treating me well.   Nice to finish this year strong hopefully and take some time off and be with the family and come out next year all guns blazing.   Like I say, Final Series, big strong finish for me is the key.
