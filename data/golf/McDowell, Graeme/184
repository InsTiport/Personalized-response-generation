  GRAEME McDOWELL:   I played pretty averagely the first nine holes.   I just kept hitting it in the wrong places.   You know, second shot to the first, decent 5‑iron off a downslope in a trap and left myself absolutely nothing for my first putt and happened to me a couple of times on that front nine.   
Bogeyed, 3‑putted the 13th, and that's when at alarm bells started to ring at that point.   Dug in, made three birdies in a row, sort of 14, 15, 16, which got me back in the middle of the pack.   I don't really want to be spotting some of the best players in the world four, 5 and 6 shots.   
So, good to battle it back and get myself back to level par, and, you know, in the right side of things.   Played a lot better that back nine and putted a lot better, so take that momentum in there tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   It's often said you can't win on the first day and you can lose it, and you are nicely in that position where you still can challenge.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I was panicking a bit the front nine.   I felt things slipping away from me and sort of getting away from me.   But I had to remind myself, there's a lot of golf this week.   Just try to steady the ship, hang in there, hang in there and managed to do that well today.   
Like I said, found my swing a little bit in the back nine, find my putting stroke a little bit in the back nine and looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow now.   
   
 Q.   Was there a stage there where you were thinking, oh, my goodness, this course, it's happening again.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, I thought, here we go again at one point.   But I had to get the head right.   Realise there's a lot of golf left.   Realise that I have the game; it's in there somewhere.   
You know, I 3‑putted the 13th.   I thought, oh, no, what am I doing here.   Managed to steady the ship.   Good 2‑putt on 14 and found my putting stroke a little bit coming in.   Good putts on 15 and 16, and was happy.   
You know, clichÃ©, can't win it today, blah, blah, blah.   You know, you can blow yourself out of it.   But that was key.   That was key to get myself back to the middle of the pack, give myself something to get back out there in the morning and fight for; I could have shot myself out of it easily today.   
   
 Q.   So it was a case of having a bit of a talking to yourself?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I was talking to myself a lot.   You always do, you always talk to yourself a lot, good or bad.   It was very much a case of not letting this golf course get to me too early in the week.   
You know, my game's in good shape, and I really committed to not kind of reacting to results on the greens.   I've let these greens get in my head in the past.   I really wanted to try and go through the process well, make sure I was hitting my lines.   And if I hit my lines, just accept the fact that, you know what, these greens, they are tough to read, and just kept that and move on.  
   
 Q.   And the fact that you did make that come back on the back nine it gives you a platform for potential momentum tomorrow.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I hit it nicely on that back nine, and like I say, made a few putts, as well.   So I'm looking forward to getting back out in the morning.   It could have been a very disappointing evening if I had not made those three birdies coming in.   
But now, you know, no panic, middle of the pack.   I'm five, six behind, but a long way to go.   I've won many tournaments from here; just get back out in the morning and get at it.
