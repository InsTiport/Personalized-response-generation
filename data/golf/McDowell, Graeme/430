 Q. You must be pleased on a day like today with the leaders falling all over the place; it looks like possibly you have your best finish in a major and certainly your best win in a major in America. What do you feel at the moment about the work you've done this week?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I'm very happy. I didn't go to the first tee on Thursday feeling particularly good about my game, but I've consistently played better every day. 
 I struggled a little bit today. It was tough, really difficult wind direction today. Nothing really seems to come easy. Hung in there well today. Level par, so I'm pretty happy with that in general.

 Q. Just the way that today went, did you play aggressively? Did you look for a Top-10? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think it was very hard to play aggressively. It was tough to get at some of the pins. The wind direction, the wind strength was very high, so you had to sort of manufacture shots, hold them up, sort of knock them down, and then just try and putt your way to the flag. 
 I scrambled well, holed a few nice putts, hung in there, birdied 15 and 16 which was very nice, and hit two good shots at the last. 
 Generally, I had no chance to compete in any shape or form today, so I was just really going out and trying to keep doing what I was doing.

 Q. We keep talking about learning, but it's time to do more than learn now in the majors. Do you think you're ready for good majors year next year now that you've proved this year that you can get to the fringe of challenging?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, I think I've learned how to attack these things now. We talk about it a lot; they are different from regular events. You have to work out how to prepare yourself physically and your game.
 I've really enjoyed my four majors this year. They have been a lot of fun. I put myself in position a few times. It would be nice to post a Top-10 today that. Would be really nice. But whatever happens, like I say, I can build on this and look forward to next year and try and win one. 

 Q. You've been playing really well in the majors and not quite as well in regular events. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It's been a funny season, a bit of stop/start on both sides of the Atlantic and not really achieving much. 
 I'm looking forward to getting back to Europe now for the end of the season. Obviously Race to Dubai is very important to me and Ryder Cup points are very important to me. 
 I'm looking forward to getting to Switzerland now. I've got a couple of weeks off and regrouping and refocusing and playing good golf before Christmas.

 Q. What will make you a better major player? Is there something that will push you into the Top-10, Top-5, into contention?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I haven't been on my A game, especially this week. I haven't played my best golf this season at all. My full swing hasn't been there. My short game can still improve all the time. I just haven't seemed to come to these events really firing on all cylinders, so it has not been the best year from a full-swing point of view. I've got to keep chipping away at that and try to get myself in better form; but to compete when I'm not playing my best, that's very satisfying.
