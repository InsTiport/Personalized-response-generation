  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It was a little rusty out there today. Got off to a slow start and I wasn't particularly sharp around the greens. I have been fighting my swing a little bit, been working on something a little different, a little new and it hasn't really been looking too good in practice but it is very much a work in progress. I've had a couple of weeks off and I haven't been coming here with a huge amount of expectation, I just came here to work hard and get ready for next week, so if a good week gets in the way then great. But it is a tricky golf course and you have to play good round here to score. I'm just looking forward to the weekend so I can keep testing myself out there and try and get it into the red.  
  
  Q. What was the swing stuff you're working on?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I haven't really been swinging the club my best, I've had it a little bit steep on the backswing and I am just trying to round my backswing out a little bit but it is a hard move for me to do and it has thrown my timing off a little bit as well. But we are chipping away at it.  
  
  Q. It is one of those things you're still having to think about out there, it's not coming naturally yet?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Exactly, yes, that's the problem. My swing hasn't been looking very good on video and I have been trying to remedy that a little bit, especially the driver. That is where I've been having the main problem but it is a great week to get it worked on.
