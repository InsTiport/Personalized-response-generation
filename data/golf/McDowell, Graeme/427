 Q. 2-down after eight, that needed something special and you certainly produced it; what a run from there.
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Birdied 9 obviously. Rory made a good putt and the boys made a mistake on 10. Both birdied 11. Rory hit a great shot to 12. We really put the foot down on the back nine. We played some decent golf early doors, they hung in there well. 
 We felt like we had a point to prove, disappointed to lose yesterday, ran into a built of a buzzsaw; the guys played really, really well and we were coming out this morning pretty up for it.

 Q. From your perspective, 6-under through eight holes, that's what did the damage, wasn't it?
 RORY McILROY: We knew we needed to do something pretty special. Started off great by birdieing the 9th and they did make a mistake on 10. You know, we were looking like we were going to make three there as well and just played very solid golf coming in. 
 G-Mac hit a really nice shot into 15 and I was able to make it count and he had one of the best bunker shots I've ever seen on 16. It was great to finish it off and it was nice to beat that pair because they are a very strong pair, they are very, very steady golfers and it was nice to come out on top. We were really up for it this morning. We didn't like losing yesterday. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Rory played fantastic today. He putted great. He holed some really, really key putts, early doors. My putter has been hot the last couple of days, his was hot today, no doubt about it, and he played lovely.
