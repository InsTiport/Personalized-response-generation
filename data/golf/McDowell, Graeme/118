  JOHN BUSH:   Okay, Graeme, 4‑under par 68 for you today.   Nice start to the event.   Just get some comments.
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Yeah, you know, decent score.   Tricky golf course this one, as you're probably seeing out there.   The greens are very, very fast.   They're not playing at its full length.   Trying to be nice to us this end of the year and trying to be gentle on us. 
But it's still a tricky golf course.   Get on the wrong side of the flags it can make you look real silly.   I did manage to (indiscernible) one putt there.   Hit it on the par‑5, 7th, and hit my putter probably off the green. (Indiscernible.)
All in all, 4‑under par, I think there is a lot of course knowledge involved in this course, guys that know their way around this place. 
There are a few subtleties and a few pins, like I say THAT you got to stay ON the right side of.   All in all, 4‑under, pretty happy with that.

Q.   Is it fair to say that last hole leaves a sour taste in your mouth, finishing with a bogey?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   (Indiscernible) a very difficult golf course.   So, yeah, I had a similar putt to that on 10 which I kind of blew through the fringe.   This one kind of (indiscernible).
I mean, I hit a decent second shot.   (Indiscernible) just didn't come over.   You know, tricky finishing hole here.   218 to the flag, so‑‑ to the green.   Tricky. 
Never nice to bogey the last, but I'm sure I'll have a cold beverage and forget all about it and get ready to play tomorrow.

Q.   You and a cold beverage?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   No, no.   I'm looking forward to a few weeks off coming up here and having a few cold beverages. 
But it's good.   This is a good week with (indiscernible) Hero coming in and supporting this event.   Obviously for me being at home with my family this week, this is a lot of fun.   It's a great golf club and a great golf course.

Q.   (No microphone.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   I come over here half a dozen times a year, something like that, with some friends.   They sort of host me.   I don't play as often as I should.   I probably should come over here more than I do. 
Lake Nona is a hell of a lot more user friendly than this golf course, shall we say.   So it's not really someplace I'm going to take my dad to play.   He'd prefer to play Lake Nona.   That's more his style.   This golf course is great for guys getting your game ready for the majors.   You can see why Tiger has chose here to live with the green shapes. 
It's a really good test of golf, this golf course. 

Q.   Can you pick out a highlight of your round? 
GRAEME MCDOWELL:   Probably like I was talking about when hit a nice 5‑wood into the middle of the green there, puttered it off, and then chipped it in.   That was nice.   That was cool.
