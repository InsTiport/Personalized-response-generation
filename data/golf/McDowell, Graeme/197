Q.  Give us your thoughts on what looked to be a battle for
even par?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Yeah, I mean I think battling pretty
much sums up the way you've got to play on this golf course.  You
know, I struck it much better today, I had more control on my ball
flight.  I did some work last night with Pete.  And got the ball a
little more under control.  I was a little frustrated coming in
yesterday that I didn't hit the shapes I wanted to hit.  This
morning I did that better.
I left a few out there, but all in all I was very happy
with the general ball-striking today, the way I got it on the
fairways.  I took my medicine when I was out of position.  And I
was going to say slightly more enjoyable this morning.  I enjoyed
it as much as this golf course allows you to enjoy it.  It's very,
very difficult.  You've got to play extremely well here to score.
And I certainly watched how it was done the last couple of days
from TW.  He was pretty impressive.
Q.  Easier today than yesterday when you were out?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Yeah, greens were significantly slower
this morning.  I want to say they were at least two feet slower,
Stimp-wise.  I left a lot of putts short.  Very tough to adapt to
the slightly new conditions this morning.  I'm not going to say
the greens were soft or receptive, they certainly weren't.  But
the fire had kind of gone out of them.  It will be interesting to
see what happens to them here this afternoon, to see if the guys
experienced what we experienced late on last night.
But there's no doubt they were significantly slower this
morning.
Q.  Pleased to be here for the weekend?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Yeah, not like me to make a cut.  So
I'm pretty happy with that.  Get your money on me now (laughter).
I only win when I make cuts, apparently.
I'm very happy to be in here for the weekend.  I
certainly didn't want to be sitting at home watching this on TV
this weekend.  I'm ecstatic to be here, it's going to be a
beautiful weekend.  This golf course is going to get nothing but
tougher and tougher.  If I can go out tomorrow and shoot a number
about, who knows?
It's tough to see the leaders getting beyond 4 or 5 under
par.  Literally anything a little under par could win at this
point.  We saw how difficult it can yesterday.  After today, I'd
imagine they can sort of let the hand break off and let the golf
course accelerate away from us.  It will be interesting to see
what happens this weekend, but I don't expect the scoring to be
much better.
Q.  What do you think you're going to have to do over the
weekend?  If the scoring quite difficult over the weekend as it is
now, what do you have to shoot?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  I'm 4-over, I'll need to be targeting
4-under par.  267 is realistic to have a shot.  Certainly doable
in the morning.  I saw that this morning.  If I could have putted
a little better this morning, I could have easily shot 2- or
3-under par.  There's a score out there, for sure.
It was just good to see the ball behaving itself a little
bit this morning.  Like I say, just couldn't get it to the hole on
the greens.  Left a few putts out there for sure, but was
generally very, very happy with the way I played this morning and
the way I ground.  I was a little disappointed when I came off the
course last night.  Spent an hour on the range with Pete, and
worked things out.  Was able to come out and execute this morning.
Q.  Would you like them to water the course again tomorrow
morning, the way they did this morning?  Later start is going to
be tough, you're going to be in the middle of the pack.
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Like I say, whatever they did last
night, this morning, to try and settle this golf course down a
little bit from what happened yesterday afternoon, I imagine
they'll do less of that going into tomorrow.  They'll be less
afraid now of letting the golf course go.  It's a Major weekend,
it's supposed to be tough.
There's no doubt the early starters have a slight
advantage in this golf course.  The greens get shiny and crusty
and very, very slick around the holes, which we experienced
yesterday afternoon.  There's no doubt, they were substantially
slower this morning.  The early starters like myself tomorrow will
have an opportunity to go out and go low, hopefully.
Q.  What are your thoughts on Tiger's play?  (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  He was very, very impressive the last
two days.  He will not be far away this weekend the way he's
playing.  Iron play, the flight control that he has in his irons,
he just hits the shot that you're supposed to hit at all times.
He plays the golf course very conservatively, which I expected him
to do because his iron play is -- I'm not sure there's a better
iron player in the world.  It's incredible how well he controls
his ball flight.  And he's putting exceptionally well.  I lost
count of how many 8, 10, 15-footers he's made for par over the
last two days.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  He hung in with his putter the last two
days.  There's no doubt about it.  This golf course is very tough.
And it's going to ask questions of you quite often.  And I lost
count the last two days of how many comebacks he made for pars,
leaving them short, blowing them by.  He's putting them
exceptionally well.  He hasn't had to --  I had to double check
with Joe, his caddie, that the driver head cover actually had a
driver underneath it, because it actually hasn't seen the light of
day, not even close.
He's playing the golf course very conservatively.  Using
his iron play to devastating effect.  Very impressive.  I said to
him on the 18th green, "That was a clinic the last two days.  That
was very impressive."  Combo that with some great putting, he's
going to be dangerous.
Q.  How hard would he be to beat?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  It would be very hard for me to beat at
this point, if he keeps playing like he's playing.  What did he
shoot today, level 2-under, he's six shots ahead of me.  All I can
do is go is focus on my game now.  It's very difficult to focus on
your own game when you're watching the best player maybe ever the
last two days, and especially with Louis pulling out.  It kind of
made the intensity level kind of crank up a little bit.
I enjoy playing with Tiger.  I'm fairly comfortable
playing with him.  The only trap I ever fall into is just standing
back and admiring what's happening beside me.  It takes you out of
your own zone sometimes.  I'm looking forward to getting out there
tomorrow and getting in my own zone and trying to play some golf.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Really?  It's like, do I have to follow
that?  No, like I say, he's so impressive.  The only downfall that
I kind of find when I play with him and players of his caliber, is
that you find yourself getting a little too full of admiration.
You need to believe in your own game.
I was happy with the way I hit it this morning.  Like I
say, big key for me tomorrow is to get out there and get focused
on my own game is try and shoot 4- or 5-under par, and who knows,
I might have a shot come Sunday afternoon.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Yeah, like I say, just talking about --
just flighting the ball better and better.  It was better today,
but I need to work on it a little better.  I had like a 3-iron,
driving iron in the bag, which I don't -- talking about Tiger's
driver, I don't think my 3-iron saw the light of day.  I'm not
enjoying hitting it.  It's basically 13 clubs in the bag.  So I
need to find a club that I can get in play off the tee.  Because
right now I'm kind of driver, 3-wood, 3 hybrid and 4-iron.
There's a gap there, I need to fill in that gap somehow and just
putt better, really.  Just knock in those 10, 15-footers a little
better and just get going.
Q.  Are you surprised, then, that you have won more Majors
than him the last five years?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Yes, there's no doubt.  He certainly
looks like he's very close to being back.  So there will be no
surprise to me if he's picking up the Claret Jug on Sunday night.
But I'm not writing off the rest of the field.  There's quality
players there in this field, and I'm certainly not writing myself
off.
But if he continues to play the way he's playing, he's
going to be tough to beat.  But like I say, everyone else has
raised the bar a little bit the last five years, as well.  But
like you say, it's nice to be the only man in that two-ball that's
won a Major the last five years (laughter).  Hadn't thought about
it that way, maybe I should have.
Q.  DC up there, too?
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Great to see Darren playing well.  I
saw him on the board early today.  It's great to see him playing
well.  I know he's had a rough couple of years and he's a good
friend, and one of those guys that you certainly can't help
pulling for.  So good to see him on the boards.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Me?  6th.  What is that?
Q.  Par-4 where you went left.
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  That was an 8-iron, like a little 150
turn in there.
