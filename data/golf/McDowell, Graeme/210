Q.   How did the waiting go for you?
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It was kind of borderline where we thought we could do it without warming up again.   It was fine.   I went back out there and hit a 5â€‘wood about 15 feet.
Kind of a funny day.   Got off to a slow start, couldn't get the ball in the fairway.   Made double on 2 from nowhere. 
Kind of got a bit of a jumper on the fairway on 11.   Up and down day. 
It's the U.S. Open, never out of it.   Just got to pull out those last six holes really, really strong in the morning.   Get out there in the afternoon and get after it.
