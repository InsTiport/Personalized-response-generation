  GRAEME McDOWELL:   To try and retain this great Ryder Cup, it's been an exciting weekend.   I thought for a second the r yesterday the U.S. were going to drive off in the sunset on us.   
   
 Q.   What about Martin Kaymer?   He has not been on the best of form, to play under this pressure with The Ryder Cup, to hit that bunker shot what can you say about that?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:     He's been quietly confident in the team room this week, even though he has not been playing his best and he has not been winning points, he's just had that quiet confidence, so no better man for the job right now.
