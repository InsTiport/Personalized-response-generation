   GRAEME MCDOWELL: I came here two years in a row now, and I'VE have just completely run into a buzz saw. 
 Luke played beautifully today. He just kept making them from outside me. Every time I'd smell a sniff of a chance, he'd just make a great putt. A couple of chances on the front nine when he was out of position and 15- and 20-footers for pars. 
 9, inside of me; ten, on top of me. He just putted the eyes out of it. It's stuff to argue with. I actually played some good golf myself. I made a couple of small mistakes myself, but generally can't complain about the way I played. 
 Early in the week I was really, really puzzled about my form. It doesn't matter how well you play in this first round, if somebody plays better, you're going to home. Simple as that. There's going to be plenty of guys this week who played better than me and went. In my experience, this golf tournament was very bitter sweet. I seem to run into guys who are just birdie machines. Zach Johnson made eight or nine against me last year. I think Luke made nine against me today. These guys are good, simple as that. 

 Q. (Inaudible.) 
 GRAEME MCDOWELL: My game is in great shape. I got to stay passionate. You can't go chasing it. I have to say I'm very, very positive about the way I feel. I played great both weeks in the desert the last two weeks. There's nothing out at the greens. I'm a good putter. I'm back putting well again. The rest of my game feels great. 
 If I get in Doral, well and good. If I don't, we just got to keep plugging a way.
