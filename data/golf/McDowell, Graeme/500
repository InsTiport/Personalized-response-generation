GRAEME McDOWELL:  I'm certainly on the road to recovery, but I'm just not real quite on top of my body right now.
Q.  You were obviously giving it a go.  Were you doing physio before you went out?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  I was working with Dale for ten days and he did an unbelievable job.  Playing golf on pain killers now    I just need rest and it needs a bit of work to get that start back.
Q.  Is it striking the ball that you feel the pain?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  There's really no pain, it's just the muscles all around it are    it's just a bit asleep.  They're just numbed up and not responding very well.

I've got a sprain in my spine, in some muscles in my spine.
Q.  And this is all from the accident?
GRAEME McDOWELL:  Yes.
