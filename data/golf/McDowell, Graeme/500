Q.
Your impressions on your play through 17.  You really climbed the scoreboard.

Graeme McDowell:  Yeah, 18 kind of kicked me in the butt a little bit.  It's disappointing.  Golf is a cruel game.  I'm feeling pretty bad right now, but there's obviously tomorrow.
Q.  What was your plan there on 18 and what actually happened?

Graeme McDowell:  I don't really know what to do off 18 tee.  I know driver goes through into the bunker.  I just thought if I could hit a good drawing 3 wood just kind of close to that tree on the right hand side I'd have a chance of holding the fairway.  I just turned it a little too quickly and I hit the tree, had a straightforward punch into the fairway from there which I messed up, and then it all snowballed from there.  But 18 is a tricky golf hole.
Q.  You had a lot of birdies early but you made up a lot of ground.

Graeme McDowell:  Yeah, as I say, I struck it nicely.  I was really happy with the way I played.
Q.  Is 18 a fair hole, do you think?

Graeme McDowell:  Not in the wind we're playing in right now.  It's nearly impossible to hold the fairway.
Q.  What did you play the first two days?

Graeme McDowell:  I hit driver in the left rough.  I had a good drive yesterday.  Today I had driver and it was way too much club, tried to hit a nice 3 wood down the middle of the fairway.  It's a really, really difficult golf hole.  I wouldn't say it's unfair, but I would say it's out of character with the rest of the golf course.  The rest of the golf course is straightforward, it's all laid out in front of you?  But 18 is just a brutal golf hole.
