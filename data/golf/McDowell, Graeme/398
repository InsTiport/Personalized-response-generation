 Q. You have to be happy with that this morning?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, it was another reasonably frustrating day on the greens. I actually played a lot better today, hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. Pins were tucked away on some ledges, and it was difficult to get at a few of them and the wind popped up a little bit. It was tricky-ish this morning and I feel like I left a few out there again. Nice to birdie the last with a bit of style. 

 Q. You're one of the first out there this morning, the leaders are obviously playing this afternoon, what's the course like?
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Like I say, there are a few pins kind of tucked away on some ledges, and with this breeze, obviously the outward nine is going to play reasonably straightforward and the back nine is going to play pretty tricky. It's more of the same. The greens are a bit of softer this morning. They have got a bit of rain and they are quite receptive. There are birdies to be made out there, but it is a lot trickier today like I say with the breeze popping up and some tricky pins. 
 More of the same, frustrated on the greens, didn't hole anything at all until the last, holed a nice one, I made three birdies today and apart from that bomb on the last, I had a chip and a putt from short change and a tap-in, so there really wasn't much going on on the greens. I think I missed two greens out there this morning. 
 I played some solid golf, a bit more like it tee-to-green. I just haven't got hot with the putter this eagle r week but trickier this morning with the pins up on ledges and tucked away and a little bit of a breeze coming across the course so it's going to be an interesting afternoon for the leaders, some showers coming through and some sunny spells but generally a little bit of a wind to make us all think a bit.

 Q. Rory and Michael Hoey are five back; do you still give them a chance? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Absolutely. Ross Fisher played unbelievable golf yesterday. If he continues to do that he's going to be a tough man to catch.
 But good to see guys like Rory and Michael making a bit of a run this weekend. With the way the golf course is set up and a bit of breeze this morning, I think there are 65s and 66sm, but there are also some bogeys out there.

 Q. What do you think is possible looking at the board? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I saw the forecast was for 25-mile-per-hour gusts this afternoon, so I was out there trying to post a number and get myself back into some sort of more respectable shape on the leaderboard.
 But like I say, I just couldn't quite get the ball in the hole and I was looking to post 5-, 6-, 7-under and maybe have a sniff tomorrow if it blew hard this afternoon but didn't quite get the job done but like I say it will be a tricky afternoon for the boys.

 Q. How tired are you, post U.S. Open blues? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm getting there, physically I'm back but mentally getting my edge back again is still a process I'm going through but it's all good. I'm feeling good. Like I say tee-to-green I was good today, and things -- the signals are all there that I'm on my way back and I'm looking forward to a nice day tomorrow and obviously a big two weeks ahead.
