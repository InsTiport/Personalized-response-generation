GRAEME McDOWELL: I'm happy enough with that.  You know, sort of 3-under through ten, and had my chances on the back nine.  And you know, a few putts that could have went in, but generally very happy the way I putted today, so I can't complain.  Hit a lot of decent shots and decent starts.  Looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow.  Good company day with Dustin and Justin, two of the best players in the world, and inspiration in itself.
Q. Coping well in the heat?  Because it was pretty tidy out there for a while.
GRAEME McDOWELL: Those last three or four holes were nice there when it kind of got a little darker and felt a little cooler.  But it's been a little hotter than I expected it this week, but you know, it's such a nice place to be, Hong Kong.  We love it.  We love the job UBS do here and we just love being in Hong Kong.  This is such a fun little golf course to play.
Q. If you would like to elaborate, it is special, and you've certainly had some decent form down the years here.
GRAEME McDOWELL: It's a thinking man's golf course.  Playing with two of the longest hitters sort of around with Dustin and Justin today.  They can't really use their power a lot.  You have to hit it into the same spots quite often, and you have to position the ball in the fairways to have a chance to attack the pins.
So a lot of accuracy involved here and you've got to hang tough and you've got to be patient.  There are a lot of chances out there but if you compound errors, you can get in big trouble.  I enjoy this test and I've always enjoyed coming to this tournament.
Q. We've talked about this across the season but you're feeling better and better, making the right steps forward?
GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, steps in the right direction all the time.  A couple of disappointing nine holes back nine at the Dunhill and back nine at the British Masters have really stalled what has been a really good sort of couple of months, really, I suppose; steps in the right direction, everywhere.  And I walked away disappointed from positions of real strength.
So I've done well taking the positives and I'm happy where I'm at and continuing to hit some good shots.  So the confidence is building all the time and I'm enjoying being back at it.
