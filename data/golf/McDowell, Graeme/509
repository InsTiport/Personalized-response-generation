GRAEME McDOWELL:  I have actually played pretty similar all three days, yesterday I hit it in the the wrong places a couple of times but today was back to business. I really controlled the ball well and dodged the bunkers as you have got to do around here. I am holing putts, been holing them all week. I am making a lot of birdies, which is a lot of fun.

I birdied nine, gave myself six feet on ten which I missed, should have birdied 11 and should have birdied 12 from a great position in the fairway. I was a bit frustrated at that stage. Kind of made me a bit angry so that is why I got it going. Obviously had a great chance on 17 to make it four in a row.

All in all I will take five under. I think it is going to put me in the second last group tomorrow.

I am swinging the club 100% better now. I have all year really. The swing has been improving every week. Feel like I am hitting as good right now as I have all year maybe better so I am in great shape and excited about the rest of the year.

I have had a couple of opportunities recently to do well in Germany and at Woburn; so am determined to learn from those and win again. St Andrews again will be special, much depends on the weather.
