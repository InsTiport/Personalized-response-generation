  GRAEME McDOWELL:   It was a great game today against two really great competitors.   Jim Furyk played particularly magnificent.   My job is fairly easy.   I've got the best player in the world beside me and he makes my job extremely easy.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your emotions as they came back at you.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, we got into a good lead.   I had a very makeable birdie putt on 12 and could have extended there‑‑ 13 was playing tough and then they made three good birdies in a row on us.   They came back at us really hard and we just hung in there, tried to get up‑and‑down on 17 and obviously a great up‑and‑down at the last.   Conditions out there were not easy coming in, and glad we hung on and did what we needed to do.   
   
 Q.   What's it like with 40,000 people wanting you to lose?   
RORY McILROY:   We were talking about it out there, for the first couple holes, it's a little bit strange but you get used to it, you get used to the "USAs, USAs," and it just becomes normal.   It's part of the week; it's normal, and we are trying to shut them up as much as we can.   
   
 Q.   Do you know what's going on this afternoon?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I think Rory and I are going back out again this afternoon so I'm excited to be alongside this great player again.   Great to get that point on board.   It's a very important session for Team Europe this morning and we wanted to personally go out and try to get some blue on the board.   We did that and we were lucky to get the point in the end.
