 Q.   How would you rate the three‑hole stretch, the Bear Trap?  
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Probably some of the toughest three holes in world golf really.   Especially when the wind is up like it is today.   15 is playing dead across right‑to‑left, and 17 is playing into right‑to‑left.   And fun pins today, so makes it kind of interesting.   You kind of just have to man up and hit the shot.   You start bailing out, and you're in trouble.   
You know, I look at the pin on 17 yesterday and I ask myself, is it a good hole or not.   Maybe they should have used up all the tee there and made it a little more exciting.   Like I say, some of the toughest three-hole stretch of world golf.  
   
 Q.   Chasing the leaders tomorrow, in that three‑hole stretch, is that where you have to be aggressive, because if you get a birdie it's like a stroke and a half.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   For sure, it's toward the end of the round, so I'll just have to weigh up where I'm at.   
I didn't quite go as low as I wanted to today.   I just didn't hit the ball close enough to the hole and I was struggling with the putter from long‑range.   But I'm going to have to go out there, the front nine is where you make your score on this golf course and then you've kind of got to hang on tight coming through the Bear Trap.   
It's been a great test of golf this week as always.   I love this tournament, feels very European with the wind whipping across the links here.   And it's just a great golf tournament and Honda do a great job.   Hopefully I can go make a few birdies tomorrow and give myself a chance coming down the stretch.
