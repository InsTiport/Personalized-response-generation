FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  My swing after last week, it was very windy, the swing is not perfect, but my putting is very solid and chipping is absolutely fantastic.  So it's a little bit surprise for me to be high on there because the swing is not fantastic.  I missed a lot of drives.
Q.  You used the word "windy" and it's certainly picked up over the last couple of hours, which points to how good of a round this is.
FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  Yeah, it was very tough and it was a little bit hard waking up early this morning.  Now I'm going to go have lunch and then go back to the range and do some work.
Q.  Tell me how pleasant a finish that was to get in with an eagle at the last.
FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  Yeah, that was fantastic.  That's a great lie on the second shot, I was close to the trap, and just tried to make a solid swing and I hit a perfect shot, just short of the pin in line and a very nice putt.
Q.  Forget about Ireland, but just tell me about your form in general, there have been signs it's coming back.
FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  Yeah, well, I'm okay.  I'm very consistent this year.  I've played very solid at the start of the season, but with a lot of great putting.  Actually my short game, it's very, very good.
Q.  It's a nice time to come into some form as well, isn't it?
FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  Yeah, absolutely, biggest tournament of the year, then the French Open, and it's my first time here.  It's a great place, fantastic course, there is some great players.
Q.  What are your impressions of this West Course?
FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE:  It's just a great course.  There's some long shots but if you play well, hit some birdies.  There's no surprises when you see the leaderboard, Donald, Cabrera, Casey, Els, all the good players.
