 Q. Compare conditions from now today to yesterday afternoon? 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Less wind, so it was very different. Much easier this morning. 

 Q. You're playing well of late, what do you put the good form down to?
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: I hit the ball great. Yesterday I missed two greens and today I missed just one green on 17. It's great to play like this.

 Q. Your caddie said you had some bad food and didn't feel good on the golf course?
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: It was a pasta, a lot of sauce, and normally I like that, but there was too much. 

 Q. How much garlic? 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: No, it was carbonara, but I called the doctor on the course and afterwards I was a little bit better, but I was tired as well. It my fifth event in a row, so I think I need a good rest this afternoon.

 Q. And next week is the French Open, a big event for you. 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, it's a great event, there is everybody, family, friends, but if I hit the ball like this, it will be a great week. 
 Today I hit the ball great. Just better putting on the back nine today, and so it was fantastic. 

 Q. Much easier golf course today than yesterday?
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Much easier and less wind and greens are much better, as well. So it was very different this morning.

 Q. You played great lately. What do you credit it to?
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Changed the swing a few months ago and tried to do a good swing and it's perfect. 

 Q. I just heard you don't feel very well this morning. 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: No, I had dinner in an Italian restaurant last week and maybe it's not a good idea, but yeah, just some pasta, too much sauce maybe. I called the doctor on the course and was better. 

 Q. Do tell just how pleasing that round was. 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: It was great. Honestly a big pleasure. I hit the ball fantastic and the driving is solid. I've got an incredible iron game and the putting was better on the back nine. So honestly a big pleasure to play like this. 

 Q. Pelle said you hold a couple of very nice putts, as well. 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, he played as well very solid but I think if I hit the ball like this -- honestly yesterday, I shot 2-under but 33 putts was the maximum. So we'll see for the weekend. But there is no reason to hit the ball bad, so it's good. It's good for the weekend I think yeah. 

 Q. Are you brimming with confidence now? 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, it was difficult for one year, the confidence was lost. So that's just coming back. And I've got some pleasure today and it's very important. For one year ago on the course with the head like this, and now it's very different. Yeah, it's a pleasure to play, that's the most important thing.

 Q. What is the change down to? You say it was one year where you didn't feel happy out there. 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Honestly I think I work hard on my swing to be square and solid. I think now it's probably the best swing I've ever had. 

 Q. Having the doctor on the course today, that must have been a bit worrying?
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, it was the first time for me calling the doctor on the course but for the first time going back to the truck, sake something and he came back two holes after, and it was perfect after. 

 Q. Feeling better now? 
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yes, great. I'm going to have a sleep after lunch because I'm so tired. Yeah, I'm feeling good now.
