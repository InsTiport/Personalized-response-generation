  Q. 68 today, how pleased are you with that round?   
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: It was great. I had a good feeling on the green, and I had a very good partner with Robert, he's such a nice guy and really a pleasure.   
  
  Q. Did it help that Robert was also piling on the birdies, as well?   
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, Robert played very solid, also, and be maybe he missed two or 3-putts, but still a good round and a good game, so I think he's going to be dangerous for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. And tomorrow, important to get a good score because it's probably going to be a low score that wins it?  
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, but you know, I'll just try to take some pleasure on the course after the last six months, very hard. So if I shot level par or 6-under tomorrow -- I just want to take some pleasure. I was close to stopping the season three weeks ago, so I'm very happy to be here and we'll see tomorrow.  
  
  Q. I take it you've done that this week so far, you've taken some pleasure away already.   
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, maybe because we are in France or because I know the course, I was feeling good this week. It's not perfect with the driver but the rest of the game is good, so much easier.   
  
  Q. Is that the plan this afternoon, go and work on the driver and try and perfect that?   
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: I finish and very tired today, so I'm just going to take a beer with a few friends and my parents and have a good rest.   
  
  Q. Do you have a lot of friends down watching, as well?   
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, maybe ten friends live in Paris and my parents arrive this morning, so it's good support.   
  
  Q. Nice to give them something to cheer tomorrow, as well.  
 FRANCOIS DELAMONTAGNE: Yeah, it would be good.
