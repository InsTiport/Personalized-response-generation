 Q.  To get to even and be in a fairly comfortable spot at the halfway point, yeah.  
LAURA WEARN: Yeah, I mean, after the first two days I was really frustrated. I mean, haven't by playing horrible golf; just couldn't score.   
To come back it felt really good to make some birdies. I mean, front nine I couldn't even believe what was going on. The back nine kind of leveled off, but that was exciting.   
 Q.  Especially after winning Tour Champ, you come here and had a couple weeks off, a little extra time to prepare, to rest. How important was that?  
LAURA WEARN: It was great just to get home for a little while and not have to stress about second stage. I felt really good coming in here, so hopefully I can play well the next week and see what happens.   
 Q.  And you're a Charlotte native.  
LAURA WEARN: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  So a little extra special just being back in the Carolinas?  
LAURA WEARN: Yeah, it's so easy playing close to home. It's a comfortable spot. I've been to Pinehurst a bunch. I haven't played a whole lot on these courses, but just be in the Carolinas definitely feels good.   
 Q.  When was the last time you were here in Pinehurst for a competition?  
LAURA WEARN: For Q-Series last year.   
 Q.  Before that.  
LAURA WEARN: I mean, before that it had probably been five years. I don't get down to Pinehurst a whole lot. There are so many good courses, so hopefully start coming down a little more often.   
 Q.  Have you ever seen No. 9?  
LAURA WEARN: I played once like two weeks ago. Definitely quirky, but I don't really remember a whole lot about it. Be nice to get a few practice rounds in.
