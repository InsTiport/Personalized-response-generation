  Q. Good round.   
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: Yeah, it was great. Played really solid. Didn't hit it that well on the range this morning, so got out there and just trusted my swing and it just went straight.   
  
  Q. What changed from the frame?   
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: Mind-set, I just tried to think about where I want the ball to go all the time, and I haven't been putting so well this year, but today was better. So it was very nice to hole some putts.   
  
  Q. How many?  
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: I don't know, but I had a lot of 1-putts, that's for sure. I had seven birdies, so that's pretty good.   
  
  Q. Best round in how long?   
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: Probably for a while. I think I shot 65 in Portugal last time I was here. I like Portugal. Weather is good and coffee is good, too.   
  
  Q. I saw you on television, a nice feature on European Tour Weekly at home. Did you take a long time at home?  
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: No, I did a year ago at this time last year, like a year ago. I wanted time with my family and settle in with the new baby and support my wife, as well. And I had the chance to do it because I didn't have to worry about keeping my card.   
 So a bit different this year where I have to produce results.   
  
  Q. What do you need to do?   
 MADS VIBE-HASTRUP: I need to play really solid the next three days, that's it.
