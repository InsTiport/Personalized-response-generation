  THE MODERATOR: Barry Lane shot a 1 under, 69 today.  He's 3 under for the Championship.Q. Barry, how did you do today?BARRY LANE: It was okay, actually.  I didn't play as well as I played the other two days, but I got a bit lucky when I did miss a fairway.  Managed to get it up around the green and make a few up and downs out of bunkers and stuff like that, putted beautifully.  Very happy, really. Obviously finishing the last three or four -- the last three holes are really tough.  So to finish 4, 3, 3, made birdie at 18 again today, and I did yesterday.  So yeah, very happy.  Still hanging around, and nobody seems to be zipping off with the tournament.  So you never know what will happen tomorrow.Q. The weather is a lot better today too, isn't it?BARRY LANE: Yeah.  I mean, I was dead yesterday when I finished playing.  Yesterday, I was exhausted.  Whatever it was, 102 or something.  We're just not like that.  Us Poms, we have no idea what the heat is here.  It's over.  It's much cooler today.  It's like a nice summer's day in England.Q. What are you looking to do tomorrow to get yourself --BARRY LANE: Just going to try to do the same thing I did today, make fairways and greens and hit a few putts.  Doesn't seem like anybody is going to get to 8 or 9 under.  Just try and keep playing, keep trying to shoot the lowest score possible.
