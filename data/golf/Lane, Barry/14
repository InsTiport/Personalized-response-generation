  Q. That was nicely played today, out in the sun, two, great champions alongside you and you really performed well.   
 BARRY LANE: Yeah, absolutely. It's great to play with Nick and Tom, obviously idols growing up and things. Beautiful day, beautiful golf course and if you play nicely it's even better.  
  
  Q. What's the feeling at an event like this, good crowds this week, and when you've got stellar names alongside you; does that get your juices going?  
 BARRY LANE: Yeah, absolutely, it's fantastic. The amount of people out here watching and obviously so many great, great players; if you look at the clubhouse and the guys in The Ryder Cup in '81, you have a couple of those playing, and it's just, you know, it's just fantastic.   
 For them to come over and play in our Senior Open, as well; and they still can play, that's the thing, very, very good golf this weekend. The scoring is good. It's just great fun. It's great fun.  
  
  Q. And you can still play, that's palpably clear to everybody who watches you, is your appetite still as it's ever been?  
 BARRY LANE: I've been practising and I have been playing well and I've been struggling with my putting and it started to get a lot better and I just struggled a bit today. I 3-putted three times today. I missed a couple of other ones, just struggled a bit, looking up a bit quick, not really hitting them hard enough. Just a bit fast and tentative; a bit of work this afternoon, a bit of lunch and a bit of practise.  
  
  Q. And for the weekend you're nicely in contention; hope to press on?   
 BARRY LANE: Yeah, just going to play every shot as it comes and try to do the best as I can, and if it's good enough, it's good enough. And if it isn't, never mind, that's always next week.
