  BARRY LANE:   I didn't get off to a very good start, bogeyed 2 and 3 which is a bit of a shame and actually played very nicely from then on.   3‑putted 16 but had a real smelly lie in the semi handcuff and had to go to the back of the green and 3‑putted.   All in all, getting better.   Fifth last year and third this year, so maybe it goes in twos; it would be nice next year.
I love links golf and I love playing in Scotland and obviously suits my game.   Very happy after the start to come back and just to have played very poorly on Friday, which was a shame.   But all in all, had a great weekend, fantastic, very happy.

It was really tough in the second round.   Gary's 63 was unbelievable.   Freddie was the only other person under 70, so really tough day.   Great condition, the course setup was magnificent.   It's been a wonderful week. 

Q.   Give us an appreciation of what Freddie Couples has achieved. 
BARRY LANE:   I played with Freddie the first two days.   He's such a talented player.   He hits it to far.   He had a couple‑‑ I think nearly had one 4‑putt in the second and he shot 68 second day standing on his head.   He could have shot 65 comfortably.   He's a great player and great ambassador for the game.   

Q.   And he's done it in nice style, the momentum building as the week's gone on. 
BARRY LANE:   Absolutely.   I think he was lying 70th after the first day, big jump in the last three days but he's played great. 

Q.   Next for you? 
BARRY LANE:   Two weeks off and then defending my Scottish Senior Open. 

Q.   Which you'll relish? 
BARRY LANE:   Absolutely.   Can't wait.
