Q. Talk about 18, birdieing that hole.  Not many people have done that so far.BARRY LANE: Yeah.  I mean I played very, very nicely today.  I hit a loose tee shot and made a double on 5th hole.  Other than that I played beautifully. I made bogey at 17 and the last hole obviously is the hardest hole.  Just hit a beautiful tee shot and was in between clubs.  I had -- played 180 yards.  Lovely 6-iron.  I was very surprised. Finished about 25-foot past the hole and really just coaxing it down there, just trying to get it down there.  Get it to shoot under par this afternoon is a good score and it went perfect pace right in the middle.  Very happy to finish like that.Q. Just playing this afternoon, the course maybe a little drier than yesterday.BARRY LANE: Yeah.  Very firm.  The greens were getting so good crunchy and it was the end of the day, especially with the wind as well and it was hot but it wasn't too bad.  Probably not as hot as over the weekend. Getting very dry now.  I think very close to losing them, I think on a couple, rock hard, patches where you walk on, you can feel how hard it is where the sun has been baked on it. It's a fantastic golf course.  So difficult.  Got to drive it well and hit your iron shots well.  If you do miss a green, hopefully get a reasonable lie where you got an opportunity to get up and down.Q. Tomorrow going into the weekend you're definitely within striking distance.BARRY LANE: Yeah.  This is perfect for Monty.  You've got to drive the ball so well.  He drives it so straight and putts well.  He does everything well.  He's a great player.  After not a particularly good start, coming back with a fantastic score.  He's the one to catch.
