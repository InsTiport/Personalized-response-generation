 Q.  Maria, a tremendous round; before the wind really picked up, what was kind of working well for you out there today?  
MARIA TORRES: I was just staying patient and just going shot by shot.  I got into some rough, but I had to get it out somehow.  Yeah, just stayed calm and saw the ball roll in with the putts.   
 Q.  How would you describe your season so far, a little bit up-and-down?  
MARIA TORRES: It's been a rocky season, but just trying to move in the right direction and just keep on working.  That's the only thing I can do.  But yeah, it has been rocky.   
 Q.  This is your best 36-hole score of the season.  How are you feeling going into the weekend?  
MARIA TORRES: I'm excited.  It's just two more days, trying to play some golf.  But it's exciting.   
 Q.  Do you feel any different playing close to the lead?  
MARIA TORRES: I just have to go hit the ball.  Let's see tomorrow.   
 Q.  How about playing in the wind?  Do you have much experience playing in the wind?  It's going to be a lot windier this afternoon for the golfers, but tomorrow may also be windy.  Do you have much experience doing that?  
MARIA TORRES: I come from an island, we have a little bit of wind, but not as much as has been going on right now.  But I'm excited.  I'm excited and grateful to be playing on the weekend.
