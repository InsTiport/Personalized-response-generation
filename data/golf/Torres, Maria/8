Q. Another solid, steady round.  How do you think you played today?
MARIA TORRES: I could have been better.  Always can be better.  It's hard to say, oh, it was awesome or it was perfect.  It's golf.
Q. What were you doing well today?
MARIA TORRES: I feel like it was more the patience.  I was always the time saying to my caddie that I needed to be patient throughout the round because things are going to be flipping up and down, up and down.  You just have to stay patient and just keep playing golf.
Q. Anything you could do better?
MARIA TORRES: Everything, a little bit of everything from the game.  I think a little bit I'm going to practice right now, and I'm going to hit a little bit of everything, and just tomorrow here, 1:45.
Q. How are you feeling?  You played a lot of matches.  You played two today.  How are you feeling physically?
MARIA TORRES: I feel good because I didn't get to play the practice rounds, so I got kind of like -- it was like a rest.
Q. Did you feel like you were at a disadvantage without a practice round?
MARIA TORRES: The book has helped me a lot, and my caddie has helped me a lot, so I think we're good.  I just need to pick a line and just hit the ball.
Q. Is your caddie from here?
MARIA TORRES: He's from here, Gene Calloway.
Q. So he's helped a lot?
MARIA TORRES: Yes, a lot.
Q. The girl you just beat, Dylan, has had a pretty amazing tournament or championship so far.  What kind of confidence does that give you beating somebody of that caliber?
MARIA TORRES: I honestly am not thinking of that, I'm just more focusing on my shots, and we'll see tomorrow.  I just have to come here and play golf, be ready for whatever comes.
