Q. You had put together four pretty good rounds, but I think you're more than happy to be done?
MARIA TORRES: Yes, I'm excited to be done, yes.  It was a steady round in the sense of like it started there, par, par, par, and then I had a couple birdies and then par, par, par.  But the last three pars were pars that I'll take any day.
Q. And you're looking at probably one of your best finishes if not your best finish in the LPGA.  What was it about this week that really seemed to work for you?
MARIA TORRES: I don't know.  I just came to play, and I've been here in Canada, not on this golf course, but I like all this -- I like Canada, so I think it gave me a little bit more -- I love the golf course.  I think it's awesome.  It's really like -- you have to be like strategy but also risky.
Q. So it's a balance out there?
MARIA TORRES: Yeah.
Q. Talk about the fans that we've seen out all week.  It's been tremendous.
MARIA TORRES: It's amazing.  So much people.  I have never seen so much people in all the tournaments.  It's exciting to have everybody here supporting the golf.  It's important to support it so it can grow.
Q. So now you're probably getting close to the end of the season.  Looking back on your rookie year, how has it been for you?
MARIA TORRES: It's been ups and downs, but just looking forward for any opportunity and just keep working.  Yo no me quito.  It's one of our movements in Puerto Rico.  It's really important for us just to continue working and never look back.
Q. How do you spell that?
MARIA TORRES: Yo no me quito.
Q. It's just like a motto, a saying in Puerto Rico?
MARIA TORRES: Yeah, it's a movement that we have, to always keep grinding and just keep working hard.
Q. That's what you did this year and what you did this week.
MARIA TORRES: Thank you.  Appreciate it.
