Q.   Just talk us through your round for today? 
NICHOLAS FUNG:   You know, I started the back nine, and I shot 1‑over, so I said I want to finish under par because it's so easy to putt on the front nine.   But I'm playing worse on the second nine.   I got double on the first hole, and I‑‑ 18, I bogeyed.   No, I doubled the first and doubled the last hole. 
So I got inside the bunker, so I'm trying to go for the green, so I hit the bank and came back to the bunker and I doubled.   And last hole, I tried to hit a fade shot off the tee, but I hit slice in the water.   So I dropped inside the rough and ended up six.   I pulled the shot in the bunker and I hit double from there.

Q.   So you just need to improve on the driving and tee shots? 
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, my driving.   I need to practice more on my driving for today.   I putt good today.   I saved a lot.   I saved a lot, yeah.

Q.   The weather, how is it?   You said it was slightly more cooler, I think? 
NICHOLAS FUNG:   For Malaysia, I think this is good, yeah.   But for them, very hot.   Yeah, even my playing partner said why is it so hot?   Why is your country so hot?   I told them today is considered good, yeah.

Q.   So what is the plan for tomorrow then? 
NICHOLAS FUNG:   My plan? 

Q.   Your plan?
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I've got no plan.   Just go to have fun.   Yeah, just play.

Q.   You think it was a case of trying too hard the last few days? 
NICHOLAS FUNG:   No, I didn't try hard.   I just tried to play‑‑ tried to put more on the fairway, but today it didn't happen.
