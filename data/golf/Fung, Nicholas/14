 Q.   What are your thoughts on this wonderful match?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I was so happy I could finish, get the last hole for the team.   Made a lot of birdies, a couple of bogey, overall, very happy.   
   
 Q.   17 was special, wasn't it?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, I was like so many crowds making noise, the gallery on the next fairway kept clapping for Thongchai, so I re‑address.   
   
 Q.   How were the nerves on the first tee knowing that you were leading the team out and with all this wonderful support here?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I'm happy to see all the crowd and supporters come down and support me and Team Asia.   
   
 Q.   Have you enjoyed the whole week?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, of course, definitely I enjoy a lot and I learned a lot of things from the match play.  
   
 Q.   You do learn a lot when you play in an environment like this?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I learn a lot, a little bit patient.   I have to relax.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the last putt, was it where you wanted to hit it?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I tried to putt it‑‑ it's a makeable putt.   It's a tough putt for my first putt, yeah, so I just tried.   
   
 Q.   You must be proud of yourself?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, of course, I can finish until last hole.  
   
 Q.   What can you learn that can help you in your career going down the road?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   What I learned, of course, like so many golfers follow me, first thing, I guess so much pressure, so much crowd watching me, right.   
Of course I need to learn to be more patient, yeah, because like the way I see he play is like no pressure, like so patient, no worry at all.  
   
 Q.   And maybe playing for Team Asia again?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, and of course, I need to improve myself for the future to prove that myself‑‑ to prove that Team Asia can win the next one.   I mean, not finished yet, we still have a possibility of win.   
   
 Q.   In your short professional career right now, has this been the best week of your golfing life, do you think?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, playing with top Europe and top Asia all together, yeah.
