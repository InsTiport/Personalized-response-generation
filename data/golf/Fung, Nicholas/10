 Q.   How was your day?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   How was my day?   Disappointing day again.  
   
 Q.   Was there something you were searching for you couldn't find it?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah.   Today putting slightly better than yesterday, but I still struggle with my iron shot.   I hit so bad.   I waffed a few shots today.  
   
 Q.   You serious?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   It was the last hole, 18, like tough, up wind.   The ball is too far.   I think the conditions soggy.   Of course, I hit too much the weather.   
   
 Q.   Is it a case of having some low confidence at the moment?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Not really, no.   After we stop, I go back‑‑ after I go back to resume my play, I hit it so good, so well.   So I was so wish that I could bring this before the tournament start.   
   
 Q.   What happened?   Why suddenly hitting it good after the rain delay?   Did you do anything?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   I have no idea.   Go back, I hit everything good.   I am driving straight, go back to my putting correct shot.   I hit fade, and my iron shot, hit good, hit it straight, and I putt well, yeah, on the last six holes.   
   
 Q.   So are you hoping heading into the final round tomorrow?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, I wish I could bring the last six holes forward from tomorrow.   Definitely I would shoot low score.   
   
 Q.   You talk about going back to basics in putting.   Did you do that today, and did that work for you?  
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yes.   I did it.   All good.   Putt well, yeah.   Just address ball and putt.   Try not to think so much.
