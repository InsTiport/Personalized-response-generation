 Q. What were the highlights of your round today?
 BILL GLASSON: I made some great par putts. All week I've been trying to figure out how I'm going to play this golf course. It seems to be too hard for me. But we got out and in a little less wind and this morning they moved the tees up on a few of the longest par-4s, which is really helpful. And I didn't have a whole lot of birdie putts, but the few I had, I made. And I just grinded it out and didn't make any bogeys, which is the kind of day, which on a day like this, even though you know it's calmer in the day, that's pretty good. 

 Q. Can you describe those birdie putts?
 BILL GLASSON: If I can remember. Oh, right off the bat I made, I started on 10, I made about a 12, 15-footer for birdie right off the bat, which was very good. 
 I think the bigger plus was on the next hole, on 11. I hit it in the bunker and got it up-and-down and made about a 6-footer for par. 
 Then I started kind of feeling a little bit better. I still don't know how to get the ball close to the hole. It was just, I just don't have it right now. So it was a battle. Then I shot as low ace could possibly shoot. I sure didn't leave anything out there.

 Q. What does this mean being your first championship with a round like today?
 BILL GLASSON: It's been fun, obviously. I'm not, I'm way behind everybody as far as where my game is and I don't know what to expect every time I get up to the ball, everything I do differently, than I used to do. It's a surprise. It's a lot of work because everything's a surprise. But it's fun. I'm glad I don't embarrass myself the first round and it's terrible when you have thoughts like that going through your mind before you even tee it up.
