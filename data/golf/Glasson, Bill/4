 Q.   What are your overall thoughts on the round today?  
BILL GLASSON:   Not bad.   A lot of good shots.   I had a lot of putts, felt like I left a couple out there.   But overall it's a good start.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like a very consistent day overall, only one bogey on the day, a few birdies.   What were your thoughts on the course as you went through the day?  
BILL GLASSON:   I thought that the opening day pins were fair and let us kind of get a feel for the course.   
Green speeds are what they should be, considering the shape of the greens.   So I thought that they did a really nice job of giving us a chance and dealing with the undulations of the greens.   So I thought the setup was good, really good for the first day.
