Q.  Good round, minus eight, in the hunt for tomorrow has to be a great feeling?
TJAART VAN DER WALT:  Oh, yeah, I played solid the first six or seven holes and went through a little bit of a slump on 12 and 13.  Then made a birdie on 15.  I'm satisfied with the way things are going.
Q.  How about those last four holes?
TJAART VAN DER WALT:  Well, you know, you kind of get in there and you don't really know, anything can happen on those last four or five holes.  It's like any golf tournament.  I enjoy the challenge.  Shots went my way today.  Take what I get at the moment.
Q.  Are you happy with your back nine?
TJAART VAN DER WALT:  After 11 and 12, obviously a couple of tricky shots there, but the wind was tough.  The wind kept swirling and so I'm very happy with it.
Q.  One thing you have to pretty much improve on tomorrow?
TJAART VAN DER WALT:  I have to hit my irons a little better than I have the last few days.  I'm putting well, so I guess that's what's keeping me in there.

If I can do that, I can compete.
