 Q.  On his round today. 

 GEOFF OGILVY:  I wanted to get to even and then I did and then I screwed it up on the last. 

 I played a lot better today.  It wasn't that easy.  I'm in the tournament and that's all I wanted.  If you had had told me at the start of the day I'd be 1-over, I'd be perfectly happy. 

 I thought the greens were similar to yesterday.  They did vary a little bit in speed.  Some are okay and some are really fast.
