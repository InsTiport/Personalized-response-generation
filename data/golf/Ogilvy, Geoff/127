   GEOFF OGILVY: It couldn't have been any worse. I think I only missed two greens, and one of them was on the edge. The other one I missed and I drove it in the water and made a par. Just missed putt after missed putt. It was horrible, really, to be honest with you.  
  
  Q. You hit two glorious shots into the middle of that par-5 and hit a really good first putt.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: Yeah, like you say, the first two shots on every hole, you couldn't ask for any more on any hole, and I just couldn't putt.  
  
  Q. What's in store for this afternoon?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: I'm not going to practice because practicing my putting tends to make me putt worse, so I'm going to go home and learn to putt better.
