 Q. You weren't sure on the last couple holes if you were in the BMW?
 GEOFF OGILVY: I didn't really know actually. I just assumed that I probably had to shoot even par or better today, but it was kind of a hard day really, and when you don't get off to a good start it's obviously a really hard day. But it's nice to get to Chicago. I don't feel like I played well enough today to actually earn it, but I get another chance to get to Atlanta, I guess.

 Q. On 17 you took an unplayable?
 GEOFF OGILVY: Well, it was just in a hole with a rock next to it. I mean, I could have had five swings at it and not moved it. I mean, I might have been able to move it, but I could only move it backwards towards the fairway anyway, so what's the point? I can get an unplayable back on the fairway anyway. That might have been the best putt I made all day for par. And I hit the best shot I've hit all week on the last. It just needs to fly three or four shorter, and it could be stiff. 

 Q. Did you know the putt on 17 was do or die?
 GEOFF OGILVY: The truth? I thought it was over at that point. I thought I was gone to be honest with you. I was trying to hole it. I knew if I holed it --

 Q. Is that why you made it?
 GEOFF OGILVY: Maybe. Golf is weird like that. But I wasn't not trying, but I wasn't really concerned with it at that point. I was just trying to make the putt, really. Most of the day I thought 7 or 8 I probably would have needed to be, so when you're at 5 taking an unplayable 150 yards from the green, I thought I was pretty done here. It worked out. I get rewarded with a trip to Cog Hill.
