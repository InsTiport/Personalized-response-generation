  Q. Finally made it through two rounds. Got to like the position you're in. Just comment on kind of a rough week, as far as the delays and so forth, but you got to feel good about your position heading into the next two rounds.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Yeah, I'm happy. The first 27 holes was really good. The last nine holes I played on that round wasn't so crash hot, but I was making it from everywhere at the start of the second round. Things even out. You hit a couple of long putts, and it all balances out. I'm going to be in contention the week before The Majors. That's kind of the whole reason we come here to prepare and get really, really ready for next week.   
 So it's a shame about the wind delay yesterday, which -- sorry, Thursday -- which we always have a delay in Houston, but usually we get back out there. It's kind of bizarre. It looks like we'll get back on track and have nine holes to play Sunday morning and then normal tee times on Sunday and finish. As long as we get finished on Sunday, it will be fine.  
  
  Q. Thank you.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: You're welcome.
