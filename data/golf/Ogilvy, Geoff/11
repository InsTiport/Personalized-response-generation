GEOFF OGILVY: Weeks this year weren't very good.  So it's nice to have a decent week.  Clearly, I kind of felt like I needed about 7 today probably to get to about 20 under.  That's what it kind of felt like at the start.  And the pins were really hard today, really hard to get it close.  And I did the best I could.  It's kind of one of those days you needed to make a couple of long ones and I didn't.  But I had a few under, and as I said, good week.  It's my last week here in the U. S. this year.  I got the Australian Open in a couple of weeks, so bit of form to take down there and Christmas and get going again on the West Coast.
Q. One of the special things about this tournament is the kids who are patients at Shriners Hospitals that are standard bearers, and just tell me how special it is and inspiring it is to see some of those kids out there.
GEOFF OGILVY: I mean it's incredible.  Talk about perspective.  You watch TOUR players play and half the time we got our head down and we're bitching and moaning about something.  And these guys that's proper hardship.  And they're out there and most of them have walked more than 18 holes all week, and they've got the smiles on their faces, unlike some of the players, so it's pretty inspiring stuff.
Q. Geoff.  Thanks for the time.  Best luck at the Australian Open.
GEOFF OGILVY: Thanks, mate.
