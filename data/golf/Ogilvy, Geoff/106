   GEOFF OGILVY: I played very well. Pretty solid the whole way and made a few birdies. Missed a few putts but made a few as well and can't really fault the way I played. The only bad hole was the 11th where I ended up chipping in for par, so it was a good morning for me.  
  
  Q. If you lead gets sizeable enough do you change tactics and start defending that?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: I guess if you are leading you are doing some good things and I will just keep doing as I am and playing each shot as I see it. If the ball goes where I see we'll be alright.
