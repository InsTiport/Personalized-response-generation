  Q. I'm guessing you must be satisfied. What pleased you most about this round?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: I just played well. I know it sounds silly, but it wasn't anything in particular. I drove the ball quite nicely. I don't think I hit all the fairways, but I was right next to a lot of fairways in good lies.   
 I hit my irons very well and I had quite a lot of five, six, seven-foot putts for birdies and I made all of them, I think. So it was just a tidy round of golf on a golf course that's pretty difficult.  
  
  Q. Talk about how challenging overall the conditions and the course were today.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: Yeah, I mean, this course has got a lot harder since they put the Bermuda greens in. It's got firmer. It shows you on a pretty nice day there was a little breeze but nothing to make it too hard that all you need is a little bounce on the green to add a whole new element to the golf course. You've got to miss them in the right spots. You've got to have the right angles. You can miss fairways, but you've got to miss it on the correct side of the fairways so you've got angles. It's added a whole, as I said, a new dimension to this golf course.   
 When they were bent and they had to put a little too much water on them, it was a bit soft. It's a great, fun golf course to play now and it's satisfying to have a good score.
