  Q. Alright, Geoff. 5-under six. Pretty support sporty tee shot there at No. 7, 11 inches. I know you were disappointed on what happened at 8.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Didn't feel as good as it probably was when you play with a guy who shoots 9-under. Whatever score, it doesn't seem quite up to par.  
 I played pretty well. I got away with a few loose shots and the hit a horrible shot on the eighth hole looking at making birdie, and you make a 6, which sucks a little bit, but 5-under is pretty good.  
  
  Q. You and Adam grew up in the same city. Did you guys talk? You just enjoy playing with him?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's a fun pairing. We play a lot of practice rounds together. We actually played last tournament at Doral. We both played together in the third round. So -- first round here. It's always fun when we get to play together.  
  
  Q. Course conditions couldn't be better as far as the putting surfaces.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's perfect. You hit it on line, it goes in. Anyone who blames a bad bounce on the green this week is lying because there's none of them. It's the best surface we'll have all year, probably.  
  
  Q. Thanks, mate.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Thanks, man. Cheers.
