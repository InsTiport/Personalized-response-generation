   GEOFF OGILVY: I knew I had to bring it today. Rory's obviously been making short work of everyone he's played this week. 
 I hit the ball fantastic today. It would have been coming. I hit a few balls after I played yesterday because I had an inkling of what I had to work on, and it felt great all morning.
 It was a whole nother step up the way I played today. I had to make a lot of birdies. I hit a lot of great shots, drove the ball well and made a bunch of really nice putts when I needed.
 Alastair said in the car on the way back, if you want to be second best in the world, you're going to have to be better than him. He is by far the best young player I've ever played with. He hits the ball well, chips and putts well and his demaneour is fantastic.He's the real deal. The hype is fair because he's the real deal.
 Sometimes I probably get a bit wound up in stroke play but in MP I learnt very early on, even as an amateur, that you've just got to be relaxed, do your thing. You can't control what he's doing.
