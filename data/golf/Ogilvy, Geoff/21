Q. Curious about the TOUR Championship.  How gratifying is this for you from where you started?GEOFF OGILVY: When did I start?Q. From the start of the playoffs and working your way in.GEOFF OGILVY: From the start of the playoffs, pretty good. Obviously, I won Reno a couple of weeks before, so that was kind of one box ticked, if you like.  Like I had a pretty -- it was nice to have a win exemption for the next couple of years and, I was actually, really, just going to -- pre that I was actually going to take all the playoffs off and then wait for next year. But, I do that, and then I get in Barclays.  I missed the cut, and I was truly a hundred percent certain I was not getting into Boston. And I got into Boston.  Played really well last week and finished second, and somehow managed to not fall over this week.  I'm pretty tired.  The altitude wears you out.  And this many tournaments in a row wears you out, too. So, it's great to be back next week.  To be honest with you, I'm not a hundred percent excited about playing golf next week, but I'm really excited about what making the TOUR Championship does for you.  It's the best exemption in this sport, outside of a big win. So, it helps next year's schedule a little bit.  It's been two or three years since I've been to Atlanta and, it's a nice tournament. So, I'm sure if I get home, I'll go have two nights of sleep at home, because we're not too far from there and I'll get on the plane on Tuesday morning, and I'll be pretty excited to get there, for sure.
