 Q. You got hot there in the middle of the round. Obviously you put some together but you're hearing roars. Your thoughts with 18 to play?
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's going to probably have to be low. I had 4-under, which is definitely a pretty low score out there if you play well. The greens are getting firm, so it's tough to get it close, but there's a lot of holes that are birdie holes. Hard to really say. I mean, it's going to have to be a low one tonight and tomorrow morning.
