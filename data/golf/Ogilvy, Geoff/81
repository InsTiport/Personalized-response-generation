  Q. You live not far from this golf course, and this golf course seems to favor big hitters. Seems like this is right up your alley.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: You would think so, but I play here every year, and I've played here a lot, and haven't done that well really. Maybe there's too much going on and too many people coming over to the house every night, and there's a few more distractions than normal. It's a course I feel like I should do well on. I never really have. Good start this year. Three more like that, and it can't be that far away.  
  
  Q. I know it was a huge adjustment for you to switch from Cobra to Titleist. You won your first tournament with Titleist. It's in the family, but obviously you've really well adjusted to the new clubs.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's great, you win first week out with new stuff, especially a brand new driver. The driver is really the hardest one for us to change, and I changed to a brand new driver that week, Tuesday of Maui, and I won the tournament. I've actually got a different one than I used that week now. It's going really well, and I'm happy with every club in my bag now and really comfortable, like I've had the clubs in my bag for 100 years. I feel really comfortable and I can just go on with the rest of the year.
