 Q. How does the wind affect the golf course?
 GEOFF OGILVY: When you get on 18 it's hard to play in the wind on 18. It's windy right in the center of the course. There's more trees and stuff over there. It's definitely going to be part of it.

 Q. Talk about your back-9, three birdies and bogies. Are you pretty happy with how you're playing?
 GEOFF OGILVY: Most bogies are not very good when you're in the fairway. It was a tough one. I could have made a couple more coming in. All in all I'll finish the round and it was pretty good.

 Q. Is there apart of your game that's really clicking this week, tweak up and down?
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's all okay. I'm hitting lots of good shots. I've hit loose ones, too, but I've hit lots of good ones. I've made a bunch of putts. It must be pretty good. The guys who are contending in the golf tournament are putting well.

 Q. Can you talk a little bit about Paul's game, how he's playing? You played with him in Match Play.
 GEOFF OGILVY: He's playing really well. He drove the ball really well. He's one of the longest hitters out here. Hits the ball great and, again, obviously putting quite well. Anyone who is 11-under is putting well so -- one of the best players in the world and wins very regularly outside the U.S. It's only a matter of time before he wins here.

 Q. How about the winds?
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's not ideal, obviously. I've never had a weekend where there was no rain delays and still struggling to finish on Sunday. When you lose a day basically on Thursday you're playing catch-up the rest of the time. The players on Tour don't play fast enough for us to catch up. We're going to get finished looks like at 5:00 and all going to get out of here. Anyone who needs to get to Augusta is going to get there night. It's all going to work out.
