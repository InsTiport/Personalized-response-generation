  Q. Nice finish there, three birdies on the last four holes. If you could comment on the day.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: The day was okay. That's the best I've played all week. Actually I hit the ball great Thursday, Friday and today, well enough to contend in the tournament, and I just didn't hole enough putts the first couple of days. Today was the first day I holed any putts to go back towards the right direction. 3-under is going to be a pretty good score today, so I guess I'm pleased. It's a positive for the week.   
 I have a week off, which I'm pretty ready for, and then Atlanta.  
  
  Q. You're currently projected 14th.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: Yeah, I mean, coming in here 9th going to 14th is not great, but considering I was outside the top 50 going into Boston that's a pretty good result. I haven't probably -- I don't really feel like I've earned a lot in Atlanta, but you have a good tournament in the Playoffs and you get there. I had a good tournament at the right time, so I get to go there, and it's always a -- the TOUR Championship is a slightly different field than it used to be because of the Playoffs, but it's always one of the little boxes you want to tick at the start of the year, make it to Atlanta, and I've done that again.
