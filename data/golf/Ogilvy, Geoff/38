  GEOFF OGILVY:   The whole bunker is under water.   I don't know where you're going to drop it, because you're supposed to drop it in the bunker, aren't you?   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
GEOFF OGILVY:   I don't know what they're going to do there.   It's not quite right if the whole bunker is under water.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
GEOFF OGILVY:   It's pretty unfortunate.   I guess you just have to treat them as if they've got stakes around them, which you probably should treat them like that, anyway, because they're pretty much a oneâ€‘shot penalty anyway.   But those ones on 17, three of them are completely under water.   There's one that looks like it's higher up the hill and it's bone dry.   It's really not about how much water, it's about how low they are, I think.   
   
 Q.   What do you make of Phil?  
GEOFF OGILVY:   I don't know, he hit a lot of good shots.   I mean I just imagine today he was just going to come out and play well.   He hit a good shot on the first.   He was doing all right, and then where did it come all unraveled?   6?   It was a reasonable shot he hit in there.   It wasn't that bad.   It wasn't that far off.
