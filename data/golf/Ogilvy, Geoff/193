GEOFF OGILVY:  I guess I got lucky here and got extra holes.  I played pretty well.  I didn't make any bogeys.  The extra holes have been good to me so far.
Q.  (Inaudible).
GEOFF OGILVY:  I guess.  I guess it's good practice for having to hit clutch putts and clutch shots and stuff.
Q.  You talked a little about it yesterday; you won Tucson last year this week.  You've got a pretty good opportunity to win one week, one year later, the same week at one of the biggest events, other than a major championship?
GEOFF OGILVY:  That's pretty cool.  I was pretty disappointed not being able to just defend, especially my first time out here.  I don't know what it feels like.  It's got to be fun showing up to defend.  I'm happy now that I've played well, having won Tucson.  I've played well and I might have an opportunity to win again the same week.  I told my caddie, this might be my week.
