 Q.  How would you assess the day? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Yeah, great.  It's the best round I've played all year probably.  I drove it pretty decent, birdied the holes I needed to birdie.  I birdied the par 5s, I birdied the two par 4s that we could hit it right up next to the green and threw in one or two others somewhere else. 
 I didn't make any bogeys and made a lot of birdies, and it's what you've got to do here, because the greens are perfect, the weather is perfect, so it's going to take a lot of birdies to do well here. 

 Q.  You've won in this city before.  Do you find kind of a subconscious comfort with golf courses here? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Well, I like the desert.  I live in Scottsdale, so I play desert golf a little bit.  I do like it down here.  I've always enjoyed Tucson, always enjoyed playing in the clear air or something.  I like it dry, not like the humidity.  The greens are always perfect here, too, and it's nice. 
 Coming from the West Coast there's some ropey greens every now and then.  This week they're actually perfect, so you can get some putts to go in. 

 Q.  Do you feel like you were defending champion today?  Did it sneak through your mind? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  The first tee was a little bit -- I thought about it a little bit, but once I got into it it was just golf again and just trying to beat Steve and hit good shots.  Not really, I didn't really think about it.  I thought about it on the first tee, and off I got off the first tee it was just another match.
