  Q. Geoff, nice clean card out there, today. Got it kick-started with a birdie at 1 and eagle at 4.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: I played good on a day like that today. The weather was much nicer than yesterday. Wanted to get off to a good start, and I did. I played pretty good all day. Would have been nice to get a couple more birdies there towards the end, but all in all, pretty good.  
  
  Q. Did you have to make any big adjustments going into today's round, knowing the rain and stuff we got yesterday?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Not really. It's obviously a very different course than we played yesterday afternoon, very cold and windy yesterday afternoon. About as hard as it's going to get.  
 It's nice to be playing in the warmth and sunshine today.  
  
  Q. Feel like you're back in Miami, maybe?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Well, I played well today. I'm probably going to be not too many. Not too many far shots back. You never know.  
  
  Q. Have a great day tomorrow.  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Thanks.
