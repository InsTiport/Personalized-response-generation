  Q. As you walked off the 11th, you were six shots back. When did you realize you were starting to be a part of the conversation?   
 GEOFF OGILVY: When I birdied 14 I thought I was in pretty good shape. I knew 15 was the birdie pin or the eagle pin. 16 is obviously where it is. So I thought if I could get down 15 and hit a good drive and make another birdie there, I thought I had a chance.   
  
  Q. And what will you go do now? Will you go just up and watch on the monitors? Will you go out to the practice tee?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: I'll watch it for a little bit. I mean, I'm quite a long way in front of this last group, so I'll watch it for a little bit. I'm pretty excited for Adam. If I don't get it done, hopefully he can get it done. If it appears like I'm going to have to play some more golf I'll rush over to the range and hit a few.
