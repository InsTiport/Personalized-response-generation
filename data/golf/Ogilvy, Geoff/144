   GEOFF OGILVY:  I didn't hit a good shot really.  They played well.  Steve hardly missed a shot until that hole, hit it in the water and they still won the hole.  Just didn't play very well.   
 We were struggling -- I hit the first shot I hit in about five yards, the second shot there.  And then he hits it in the water, we should have gotten no worse than a halve.  We just didn't play very well.   
 We just didn't play very well.
