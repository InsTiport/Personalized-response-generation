  Q. General comments if you don't mind about today's round.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: No birdies, a double bogey and a bogey. 3-over par. Nothing very exciting about it.   
  
  Q. Was it a situation of putting or do you feel like your ball striking was good or what?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: My ball striking was fine, I didn't hit it close enough. Seemed like I didn't make any long putts. I didn't make anything.   
  
  Q. How was the putting?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: It was hard today. There was a good score out there I think if you play golf. Today's round hurts.   
  
  Q. You were playing great, obviously this is disappointing, but because you've been playing so good, does that give you some solace going into tomorrow?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: Yeah, of course. It's not a one round tournament. It's not the end of the world, it just makes it harder.   
 I had more shots than I wanted to have. What can I say, I didn't have any fun, I shot 3-over. I just putted bad. What can I say, I didn't make any birdies and I made some mistakes out there I didn't want to play this bad but I did. What can you say?
