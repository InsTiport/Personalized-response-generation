 Q.  Obviously big turnaround for your squad, what did you talk about last night? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  I think we had four come up here on the 18th yesterday and I think we lost the hole every time, and those things even out when you have 24 world-class players.  It's going to even out over the week.  We lost them all today and won a couple of times today. 
 It's exciting for the fans that we won a few matches today. 

 Q.  Is that the beauty of match play? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  We were down early on every hole, and I just rode Nick all the way until I made one lucky birdie on the last hole.  That was my contribution.  It's just great fun.  You just never know what's going to happen. 

 Q.  This could have been a run away and hide Friday for the Americans, but the International Team has played back into contention. 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  You can never get that far behind on the first day, but you know it's a long way back and I guess traditionally the better ball has been better for the internationals and the foursomes has been better for the U.S. guys.  It's good for us we got ourselves back in contention.  We won a few matches; it was nice. 

 Q.  A birdie at the 18th, you have to feel better about your game personally, as well. 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  I do.  I was just fortunate to make a nice birdie at the end. 

 Q.  Is there a reason why the Internationals have done better than the Americans at four-ball? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  I'm sure there is, but I don't know what it is.  (Laughing).
