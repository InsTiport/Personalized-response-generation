  Q. Back to the WGC Accenture Match Play, two-time winner, Geoff Ogilvy, into the third round. It's a long week, you have match after match, do you have to pace yourself mentally?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: You do. It's kind of a weird one, you could come here and be here for three hours, or come here and play more golf than you'll ever play in a golf tournament. The clichÃ© is one day at a time. I try to win the match I play that day. And if I do, I get to come back tomorrow and do it again.   
 I played mostly good, I gave 17 away with bogey, but he gave me 18. We handed each other a hole at the end. But nice to get through and now I get to come back for the third one and see how it goes tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Has the finger healed totally from the injury on the reef in Hawaii?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: 95 percent. There's no mark there anymore, it's a tiny bit sensitive. It's on the firing line, where the right finger is touching the grip. It's more comfortable to put something over the top so I don't have to think about it.   
 As far as hitting golf balls, it's a hundred percent, but just a little red and sensitive still.   
  
  Q. Talk about the round today.   
 GEOFF OGILVY: There was some good stuff and a few bad ones after that. It wasn't a high standard match out there today, I'm sure, but we both fought quite well, no one got too far ahead. It was pretty much square or 1-up the whole way around and I felt like I gifted him the 17th. You don't want to lose the 17th to a par, especially from the middle fairway.   
 I got the gift back on the 18th. I won the 18th. Happy to get through someone like Thomas, again, he's a pretty wiley old veteran. He was not going to go away, he was not going to hit bad shots down the stretch.   
 A nice name in golf, I guess, to have beaten in match play.
