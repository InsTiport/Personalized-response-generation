  Q. Obviously not the way you wanted today to turn out. A few comments?  
 GEOFF OGILVY: He played very well. It's hard to play a guy that plays that well. I didn't start very well.   
 After nine holes and he birdied 10 and eagled 11 practically, and eagled 13 and birdied 14 and here we are. I didn't play good enough to beat someone playing like this.
