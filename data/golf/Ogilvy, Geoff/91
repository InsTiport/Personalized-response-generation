   GEOFF OGILVY: I thought if we played well we could have pushed them further than we did. We didn't play our best this afternoon. Tiger missed a couple fairways. I would have felt better if we pushed them a little bit further at least, but Angel and I both played rubbish yesterday. That was the disappointing thing, not losing really. You're not disappointed losing to a pairing like that, because it's going to go down as one of the best pairings ever, I assume it's going to be up there, with the Parnevik/Garcia type thing. But it disappointing to not play your best when you come up against guys like that because you know you have to.  
 If at our best yesterday afternoon we would have got close, Thursday morning I'm not sure we would have got anywhere near it.  
  
  Q. What does this do for your mind-set going into tomorrow?   
 GEOFF OGILVY: Obviously I enjoy match play. I just want the team to -- I would have wanted us to be in it. Last time we had a four or five-point mountain to climb in MontrÃ©al and it looks like we will have something to climb, but best case, we come out only two behind maybe, so seven and a half points to win, and that's pretty realistic. That's happened quite a lot of times. I'm just in it for the team, but it is nice to have the ball come off the middle of the clubface a couple of times.
