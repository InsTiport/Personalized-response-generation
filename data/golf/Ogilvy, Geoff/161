 Q.  When you're 2 down to win, what are you thinking? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  The way he was playing, I mean, he's just such a ridiculous short game that every time he misses a shot you're convinced he's going to chip it in or hit an amazing shot.  You know you have to make birdies to win.  Every time he stands over a putt he looks like he's going to make it, so it was a tough guy to beat. 

 Q.  Seven birdies for you yesterday; eight or nine today.  How close to the top of your game are you? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Close.  I played really good today.  Keys were especially 16, 17 and 18 I hit key shots when I needed to hit them.  I hit one bad shot I think on 14, the par 3, which was a terrible shot into the desert.  But apart from that it was good stuff again. 

 Q.  Niclas Fasth, do you know much about him? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  A little bit.  I haven't played with him for quite a while, but he's obviously very solid.  He can hit it quite a long way, and obviously beating some good players, so we'll see. 

 Q.  He's a feisty competitor, so good luck. 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Cheers.
