  Q.  Were you surprised how easy that was?   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  It wasn't easy, but I definitely got fortunate that he wasn't at his best.  He's obviously a great player, World Match Play champion over there in the HSBC, so it was obviously going to be a really tough match.   
 I was lucky he hit a couple of loose tee shots there, and every time I had a key putt I made it.  It would have been frustrating for him to watch.   
 He wasn't at his best and I putted well was the story, I thought.   
  
  Q.  That was the key:  You holed a lot of six, eight foot putts, but if you had missed them, somehow the momentum changes, and momentum is so important in this event?   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  No, it really was.  I made a birdie putt on 10 and a great one on 11, which really must have frustrated him because he was looking at winning both of those holes and then turned around and I got halves out of them.  And then I go on and win 12.   
 That's all it is.  Momentum is everything in match play, and if you can keep it on your side it's good.   
  
  Q.  Last time you won this you went to extra time four days in a row the first four days.  This must feel like half days, doesn't it?   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Well, after the last -- up to this point I had just finished my fourth extra time match in a row at this point last year, and it was a long week to that point.   
 But this has been less stressful but still a long way.  We've still got a way to play.
