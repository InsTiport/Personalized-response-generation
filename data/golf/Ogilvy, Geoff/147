   GEOFF OGILVY:  Hit it mostly good.  Made a couple good saves on 11 and 12 and apart from that it was really solid.  I just didn't make enough putts, I guess, to get the two or three shots I would have needed in the end.  I don't know what's going to do it, 14 looks pretty good, maybe 15. 

 Q.  Picking up from the PGA, do you feel like your game got even more solid this week? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Yeah, it was better I think here than the PGA.  I had a good finish at the PGA.  But I think it was a little more solid here.  Southern Hills, I really liked.  It really suited me.  Here, I've never played well at all. 
 For me to have a decent, top four or five on a course I've never really played well on must mean I'm playing pretty good. 

 Q.  Do you have to pace yourself for next three weeks?  Will you have a couple of days off? 
 GEOFF OGILVY:  Yeah, I'll take Monday and Tuesday definitely and see how it goes.  It's going to be a long four weeks.  So when we get a chance to take a few days off I think we should.
