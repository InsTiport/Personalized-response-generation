  Q.  For a lot of people, perhaps most importantly for you, 14-under par, 2-under for the day.  What are your thoughts right now?   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  It's frustrating when it's like this.  This is a pretty heavy rain, and it looks like we might even struggle to get out tonight.  That means it's a very long day tomorrow.   
 It's not a horrible time for the break.  I wasn't hitting the ball great this morning.  I felt like I missed every fairway I played.  I was hitting my irons okay, and I hit most of the greens.  But I feel it's frustrating.  It's a nice time for a break because I can go and hit a few balls before we go out again and work out why I'm not hitting fairways.  But sitting in the locker room is never any fun.   
  
  Q.  What are you going to do to pass the time?  You said you're going to hit some balls.  What do you do to pass the time when it's happening?   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  You just try to find something to do and just do what people do when they sit around inside, find things to talk about or read the paper or have a drink or have a milkshake or whatever we can do to pass a bit of time.   
  
  Q.  Do you have any experience to draw on as far as this is concerned?  I know you've obviously had rain delays before but this is a pretty big spot and you're in the lead.   
 GEOFF OGILVY:  It is.  Yeah, we have multiple rain delays every year, so we're kind of used to sitting around.  Leading a big tournament, it's not any different.  It's boring in the locker room, but what do you do?  Hopefully we can get out and play some tonight.  If not we'll just come out for a big day tomorrow.
