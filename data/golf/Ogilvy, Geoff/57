   GEOFF OGILVY: Intimidating off the tee. It's really not that narrow but it appears to be pretty narrow in a lot of places because you go over the end of this brush a few times. It's a beach course. You know what I mean? 
 The depth perception can be off a little bit when you first come around a place like that. You want to miss it on the right side of the green to give yourself a chance. Front-9 was a bit rough. The second 9 I played a lot better.

 Q. It's a penal course in a lot of ways. Kevin Na had a 15 day on No. 9.
 GEOFF OGILVY: He was in front of us.

 Q. You got to wait awhile on that one. When you see a guy going for that -- I know you haven't shot 15 on a hole before --
GEOFF OGILVY: I can't remember.

 Q. -- what are you thinking as you watch that?
 GEOFF OGILVY: It's hard. You hit it in trees like that and there's some rocks and pretty nasty stuff. You don't have to do a whole lot wrong to have two, three, four attempts to get it out. The ball hit him at some point. That adds to it. It's a comedy of errors sometimes.

 Q. You put yourself in a good position and how do you feel about your round?
 GEOFF OGILVY: I played okay. Played nicely. I was a bit rough on the front-9 but I started to hit a little better on the back-9. Hit it close, made a couple birdies. I think anything under par around here is good. If you can be under par four rounds in a row, you won't be far away.

 Q. What's your thought about the course in general, just how it played and do the players seem to like it?
 GEOFF OGILVY: I can't speak for any other player in the field except for me. I think it's okay, yeah. My second time around. I played yesterday. 
 It's a difficult golf course, very long. It's a course that rewards a bit of a aggression in a lot of spots. You have to be careful with it because you hit it in the wrong spot, there's some big numbers out there.
