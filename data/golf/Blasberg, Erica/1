   JASON TAYLOR: Erica, thanks for coming in. Nice round out there. Lowest of the day so far. Talk about the conditions out there.
 ERICA BLASBERG: They're good. They have softened up the greens a little bit so it makes that easier to attack the pins. The greens are rolling really well right now.
 JASON TAYLOR: Let's go through your scorecard. You started on 1 and had a birdie. 
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah. Probably had a little pitch in maybe 70 yards and had a tap-in.
 JASON TAYLOR: Bogey on 7.
 ERICA BLASBERG: First bogey of the week and that was a 3-putt unfortunately.
 JASON TAYLOR: What went wrong there? 
 ERICA BLASBERG: Just hit a putt a little too hard and didn't make a pretty simple second putt. First putt was probably 35 feet.
 JASON TAYLOR: Birdie on 8.
 ERICA BLASBERG: On 8 I had 9-iron in. It was a tap-in. 
 JASON TAYLOR: And birdie on 9.
 ERICA BLASBERG: I hit 7-iron in left. I was on the top the slope and I had about a probably 30-footer straight down that hill, so it was good.
 JASON TAYLOR: Then a birdie on 14. 
 ERICA BLASBERG: 14 I hit 5-iron and was probably about 20 feet. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay, 15. 
 ERICA BLASBERG: 15 I hit 9-iron and it was about eight feet. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Birdie on 16.
 ERICA BLASBERG: Hit the green in two and 2-putted. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Birdie on 1.
 ERICA BLASBERG: Hit a hybrid maybe four feet. 
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. Questions for Erica.

 Q. You said you didn't have bogeys yesterday?
 ERICA BLASBERG: No.

 Q. And yet today a lot more birdies obviously. Just generally hitting it closer today? Did you have chances yesterday that just didn't fall?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah, I mean, I think I legitimately missed one green yesterday, and I think the same thing today. My stats might have shown different just because I was on the fringe. 
 Yeah, just frustrating day yesterday just not making anything. Today front nine didn't make a lot of my opportunities, and the back nine was better because I was sticking them close and making some. Then I made a couple really good putts, so yeah.

 Q. So many low scores yesterday. Coming out there today, you know, Hey, I'm playing in the morning. The conditions are going to be even more favorable. You come out here knowing you really have to get something done today?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah, you know, I knew it was -- I'm hitting the ball better than I have pretty much all year. I just felt like if I could do what I did yesterday and try to make a couple more putts I could really give myself an opportunity, especially with a not as much wind and things like that, softer early.

 Q. Were you here last year?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah.

 Q. I know it's been talked a lot about all week, the fact that last year it was very dry. I don't know if it's a night and day difference, but just a really big difference compared to a year ago, the course conditions?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah, definitely. I mean, last year you would have -- you would hit 8-iron and it would bounce over the green. So this year they have definitely softened up the greens. I don't know if that's because of rain or they're coming out at night and doing it. 
 But the fairways are still fairly firm so you can get a little release on it. Last couple weeks for us has been pretty soggy, so this is kind of a nice change.

 Q. Were you in Arkansas?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah. Yeah. 

 Q. This week it's been talked about that not as many, the top 10 players, that type of thing are playing in France next week. You're still kind of a young player. Do you look at the field in a given week and say, Such and such isn't here. This is a better opportunity this week to really have a high finish. Do you look at it that way?
 ERICA BLASBERG: No, I don't. I look at the course I'm going to and just try to find -- I don't know. I tend to focus on courses where I really know I can score well. 
 So yeah, I look more at the course that I'm going to rather than the field. 

 Q. At the midway point compared to other tournaments this year, is this a better situation now at a midway point in a tournament this year, or have you been in this good a position before in other tournaments? 
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah, I've had a couple pretty good tournaments this year. Well, at this point. So, no, I feel like I'm comfortable here. I've been here before this year and now I can actually use some of the experiences this I've had. 

 Q. Is this your third or fourth year?
 ERICA BLASBERG: This is my fourth year. 

 Q. Like you said, you use some of your experiences from the past and, you know, hopefully this will pay off these next two days?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Yeah, definitely.

 Q. What's your life here for the next couple weeks? Are you going to Europe?
 ERICA BLASBERG: Actually, I'm not going France, and I haven't qualified yet for the British. I'm going to go over there. I thought it would be a nice trip anyway. I have a couple weeks off, so I'm going to Monday qualify over there.
