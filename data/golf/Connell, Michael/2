  Q. You got to sleep on a lead on the PGA TOUR again, but you didn't get to sleep for very long did you?  
 MICHAEL CONNELL: It's part of being in the shuffle that we are in, and you get late finishes and early starts.  
  
  Q. Your round today, obviously not quite as good as yesterday but you scrambled wonderfully yesterday.   
 MICHAEL CONNELL: I played as well today as I did yesterday. You know, the golf course is hard.   
  
  Q. Are conditions easier today?   
 MICHAEL CONNELL: Yesterday we were saying that it kind of died down on our last four holes. It was a little cooler obviously this morning but the breeze wasn't quite as strong as yesterday.   
  
  Q. Been a tough road back, you have to be proud of what you've done to get to this spot?  
 MICHAEL CONNELL: Yeah, I've worked hard and try to just focus on the things that got me here and just play golf the way I play golf.   
  
  Q. Key to the weekend is continue what you've done, hit it to the right spots on greens and just try to concentrate on that?  
 MICHAEL CONNELL: That's right. I'm just trying to place the ball in the fairway regardless of what club I'm hitting off the tee and try to hit the greens in the right spot and that kind of deal.
