Q.  Talk about your round today.  How did you hit it?
MICHAEL CONNELL:  I hit it pretty well today.  I missed a couple of shots around the middle of the round, but really only one true miss and got away with it and made par.  Other than that I shot really well.
Q.  How do you think that's going to put you into contention come tomorrow and maybe the weekend?
MICHAEL CONNELL:  Well, maybe.  A lot of golf left.  I've just got to do what I've been doing.
Q.  Talk about how the course is playing.
MICHAEL CONNELL:  It's soft right now, but I think it'll probably firm up a little bit with sun and a little breeze.
Q.  What about the delay this morning?  Do you think it affected many people and how about yourself?
MICHAEL CONNELL:  You just pretty much learn how to deal with it, you run into it enough times.
