Q Round of seven under par 65.  Tell us about that from your point of view.  Afternoon conditions seemed tougher than the morning?
KURT KITAYAMA:   Yeah, the greens got really crusty, certain holes felt like you could tap the ball down the grain, and it made it really tricky.
It picked up, the wind, a little bit, too.  So downgrain downwind, those putts, kind of a little dicey.
Q Eagle on 17, eagle 2.  Describe that from your point of view.
KURT KITAYAMA:   A little into the wind.  Hit it just short of the green in the fairway.  It was just pretty standard chip up into the grain and I just holed it.  It was nice.
Q You had not competed from the BMW PGA in October last year until Abu Dhabi last week.  How have you kept your game sharp over that period and come here and played so well?
KURT KITAYAMA:   Just played as many games as I could back home and tried to feel pressure under the gun like in tournament conditions.  Pretty much just kind of how I try to stayed sharp.
Q So not too much of a surprise for you to play this well?
KURT KITAYAMA:   I haven't played this well in a while, so nice to get a round like this.
