 Q.  68 today. Two worse than you were yesterday but which one was the better score?  
KURT KITAYAMA: Probably today. Today was a lot tougher. Especially in the morning. It was really cold, and not really sure how far the ball's flying, but yeah, today was really good.   
 Q.  What's the most enjoyable aspect of playing in these conditions? I've been watching people come down this hill, not in a very good frame of mind after a tough day on the course. What's most enjoyable out there when you get challenged like that?  
KURT KITAYAMA: Just grinding it out and really fighting out a good round. When it's playing this tough, and you come out with a couple under, it feels really good. Coming into today, I was definitely -- oh, it's going to be really tough, but it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  How do you set a target out there? You knew what a good score was yesterday.  
KURT KITAYAMA: I try not to set a number. I just kind of, you know, see how I'm playing the first few holes, and then just -- when it's playing tough, you know anything under par is good. If you can just kind a way to keep it around even.
