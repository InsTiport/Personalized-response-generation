Q. Obviously moving day, an important day for you and very valuable with that birdie on 18.
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, it was good, it was a good day overall. This definitely helps just to try to be right there in it going into the last day.
Q. The toughness of the course has obviously been a focus for the week. Has it been any more receptive today? We saw the fairways, the balls weren't running out so much off the tee, a few of the greens were holding.
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, a little bit. Still pretty firm out there with the greens, so it's still playing tough. Anything under par is a good score.
Q. Collegiate golf in Nevada. Obviously a great win in Oman. Desert golf you're very happy with?
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, playing college golf and living out there now it's something I'm familiar with. This rough's different though, it's not really desert golf, I would say, from what I play back home, so it's a new challenge and it's a good challenge.
Q. Obviously you're right there in contention, tied with Tom Lewis at the moment. Back nine here is obviously going to promise a lot more drama, there's going be to times when people are going to have to be a bit more aggressive. Where are the areas of opportunity where you feel you can go for it?
KURT KITAYAMA: That's tough. Trying to get aggressive with driver, the fairways narrow up. Maybe 10, the par-5. 13. Obviously 17 as well coming down. And then 18 that's a really good one because you're going to have to test how far left you can go and still have room without going in the water long. Just going to have to play it by ear.
