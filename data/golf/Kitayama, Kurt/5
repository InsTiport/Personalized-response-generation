 Q.  Obviously commiserations, but what a playoff that was?  
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, it was pretty fun. A little disappointed, but gave myself, you know, a couple chances. It's too bad.   
 Q.  Obviously massive positives going out of this week.  
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, definitely. To put myself right back in it today and to get myself a win would have been amazing. Pleased how today went. Obviously the ending was tough but overall, great learning experience.   
 Q.  Quick run to the plane now to South Africa. Everything packed?  
KURT KITAYAMA: No, not yet. Going to be rushing a little bit, but it's all right.
