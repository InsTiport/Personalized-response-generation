 Q.  1-under, 70. How would you reflect your week so far?  
KURT KITAYAMA: It's been pretty solid. Today, you know, conditions are a lot easier and didn't score as well, but overall, it's been pretty solid.   
 Q.  What would you say was the challenge out there then if the conditions were easier?  
KURT KITAYAMA: For me, I just didn't make as many putts as I made the first two days. Still got plenty of opportunities. Just didn't roll it well.   
 Q.  Was that something you'll be looking to work on moving into Sunday?  
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, you know, I won't think about it too much. Just felt a little off today. But I won't, you know -- loosely go over it. Just look forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  What is the game plan on the course in just attack the pins and really have a go at the lead?  
KURT KITAYAMA: Yes, quite a few back, so going to have to stay a little aggressive and then, you know, hopefully get off to a hot start, put a little pressure early. See what happens.
