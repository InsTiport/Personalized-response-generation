Q. 68, how did you find it out there today?
KURT KITAYAMA: Yeah, felt pretty good today. Gave myself a lot of looks. Hit a lot of greens. Overall, very happy.
Q. Scorecard wasn't too adventures, four birdies but no bogeys. How patient do you have to stay on a course like this, especially with the fairways the way they are?
KURT KITAYAMA: It's hard to hit the fairways. In the rough, it's hard to control, so that's why I just try to hit the greens when I'm out of position, and I try not to make any big mistakes.
Q. Stellar rookie season last year. You had two top 5s at Rolex Series Events. Obviously you're no stranger to the winner's circle, but I would imagine you're gasping at the bit to pull the trophy up tomorrow.
KURT KITAYAMA: This is a big event, SO come out ahead would be great.
Q. What is it you think you need to do score-wise tomorrow? There's going to be a lot of guys chasing, especially on the back nine?
KURT KITAYAMA: If it stays like this, going to have to play pretty well. Everyone is scoring really well. Might turn into kind of a shootout, but we'll see.
