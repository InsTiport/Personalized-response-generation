 Q.  What a great match today; how are you feeling?  
NICK CARLSON: I'm exhausted.  Mentally, physically, emotionally, I'm exhausted.   
 Q.  Playing really in front of your hometown crowd here with Michigan.  How does it feel to get to eight?  
NICK CARLSON: It's unreal.  I can't even describe it.  It all came out right there.  I was so tired on like 12, and I said to my caddie, my legs hurt.  After 17, I just kind of rode a wave until this one.  I don't even know how to describe it.   
 Q.  You made so many big putts coming down the stretch.  How do you channel all that to stay calm over some of those putts?  
NICK CARLSON: I wasn't calm over that one, but you just have to get over some of them and try to put some pressure on KK.  He played an amazing match.  He's an amazing player, and luckily I was able to just get it done.
