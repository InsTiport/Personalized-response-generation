Q. 66 today, opening 66 in your first U.S. Amateur.  Tell me a little bit about how you're feeling about the round right now?
TREVOR WERBYLO: Yeah, it was good.  First nine holes wasn't hitting the ball very good, especially off the tee.  But I kind of figured something out just to kind of get the ball in the fairway on my second nine.  And even my first nine holes I was putting well so I still was scoring well, but I knew if you're not hitting fairways out here eventually it's going to catch up to you and I was able to fix some things on the back and put it in the fairway a little more often and, yeah, it was just solid all around.  I didn't do anything special, but played to the middle of the greens a lot and when I had an opportunity to be aggressive I did and so definitely it's a good start.
Q. What did you think about the course?  Have you got a chance to play here very much previously?
TREVOR WERBYLO: No, this is the first time, so.  Both courses are sweet.  Yeah, no, they're a good test and No. 2's definitely a little bit tougher, so it's going to be a good challenge tomorrow, but yeah, no, they're all you can ask for, greens are good, so, yeah, it's good.
Q. What's the mindset going into tomorrow to try and repeat what you did today?
TREVOR WERBYLO: Yeah, kind of just same thing, not change a whole lot, maybe work on the driver a little bit, do a little bit more to be consistent, but I think you hit a little more long irons off the tee, so -- off the tee and into the greens -- so it play as little longer, so being dialed in with your long irons I think is key for No. 2.  But all in all same mindset.  The stroke play's only qualifying for match play, so there's a lot of golf left for the rest of the week hopefully.
