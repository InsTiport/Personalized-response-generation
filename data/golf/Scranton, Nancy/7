NANCY SCRANTON:   Started on 10.  No. 14, I laid it bad and didn't play it right.  It hit the trees and went in the hazard and I had to chip out.  Hit a 7-iron to about 12 feet and hit a really good shot in there, but I missed it, so I made double.  And then I hit a good drive on 15.  I had 178-10.  I didn't hit it very well, and came up short right in the rough.   I hit a good chip shot to about three feet.  And then I made that for birdie.  And then 16, I just missed  -- I hit my 6-iron and I got it caught in the wind.  And I was just a little short right in the rough, and just was not aggressive enough with my chip.  That green is kind of funky.  And hit it about six feet short.  Hit a great putt and it flipped out right back at me.  I thought I'd made it.  So bogey there. And then No. 3, I didn't hit a very good second shot.  And I was in the right rough, and I had to kind of get it around  -- flip it around the tree.  And I hit my 9-iron to about four feet.  Had a really good shot there and made that.  And then No. 4, I hit a 3-iron to a foot.  It looked like it was going in.  That was kind of fun.  I birdied that.  And then No. 6, I was on the right fringe and three-putted for bogey from about 25 feet.  And then on No. 9, I hit pitching wedge to about five feet. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   They probably were a little firmer today, especially No. 5 was really firm.  That's one of the newer greens, and I really got a lot of relief there.  I think they were firmer today.  The difference in my game was I didn't drive it very well today.  My irons were really good.  And then I  --  you know, I didn't make putts like I did yesterday.  I had a bad swing on 14 and really paid for it, made double.  Other than that, I gave myself  -- I had a lot of 10- and 12-footers for birdie.  I really hit some good putts just over the edges and flipping out.  So it was nice to finish  -- you know, finish with a birdie.  And it was kind of one of those days. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   No, I didn't.  I'm pleased with an even par round today.  Like I said, I didn't feel good with my driver.  Although, then I look back, and I had a lot of 10- and 12-footers that didn't make.  I hit pretty good putt, you know.  The speed was maybe just a little off or something.  So I felt like I gave a few away.  But, yeah, I'm pleased.  It could have been three or four over today.  But then I  --  it's always , you know, it can go both ways.  You know, you're looking at, gosh, I didn't feel like I played that well, but I had a lot of chances.  I tried to hit the ball well today. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   Yeah.  I kind of  --  you know, that's pretty typical.  Seems like that happens out here all the time.  It just seems like somebody gets a really hot round the first day and maybe somebody will the second day, but they are not in the hunt, so they just catch up a little bit and get bunched up.  I'm not surprised.  There were a lot of two or three unders yesterday.  So they shoot two or three under and they are right there. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   Exactly.  I mean, I probably have a little bit of that here.  I try not to be too careful.  And I tend to get like that.  The greens, I think, are a little bit slower this year than they have been in the past.  I had a few putts that I think from past years that I remember seeing it run six feet by.  And I hit a little too softly and just missed the break.  I mean, it's nice to go out there and be aggressive, be you don't want to be dumb about it, too.  So somewhere in there between we've got to find. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:  I think actually the difficulty makes it a little bit easier.  I think it separates the field a little  -- it will separate the field more by the end of the week.  Because, like I  --  you know, it's not that hard.  You don't have to play that poorly to shoot a few over.  But if you play real well, there's a big difference there.  A lot of times, the scores are so low, all the scores are so low, that you may have a bad round and shoot one or two over, instead of four or five over. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   Really have to focus on a shot at a time on this golf course.  You really can't get ahead of yourself, because you are going to get in some pretty big trouble.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to  -- I've been working on a couple things.  I'm going to go straight for the range, and I'm done.  Because if it's close  -- it just wasn't quite right today.  And just try to do that.  Just really try to see where I want to hit this shot and where I want to hit the next shot. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   Yes, I think so.  There are certain greens.  I mean, you just hit the middle of these greens.  I mean, no, I can't get my 7-iron to the pin, but it gets where I want to hit it.  Because I may go over the green, and you can't go over the green here. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:  I think so.  Maybe so, plus the greens are so  --  not that big.  So if you hit it in the middle of the green, you're going to (Inaudible). 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NANCY SCRANTON:   It's a big goal of mine to win again.  Like I said yesterday, I'm really pleased to be Greg's assistant this year, and giving myself a lot of chances.  That's what I'm out here now.  I want to win.  That's why we're all out here playing.
