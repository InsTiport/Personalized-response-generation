 Q. What's your experience on making the cut and the whole tournament?
 ROBIN FREEMAN: The experience on making the cut? Well, after yesterday's round the cut wasn't really a problem. I had a tough stretch from 9 through 12 today. That kind of really put me behind the 8-ball. 
 But it was a tough day and I didn't execute real well. I paid the price for a couple bad tee shots. I had two unplayable lies that I had to take and then 3-putted 1. 
 But it just wasn't a great day, the wind was very tough, and I'll go get 'em tomorrow.

 Q. What do you think you're going to try to improve on? Because you did really well yesterday. 
 ROBIN FREEMAN: Well I got to drive the ball a little better than I did. I haven't driven the ball really well at all. Well, I shouldn't say really well, I just haven't been spot on with my drive. And out here you need to be spot on with your drive. You need to be in the fairway. So hopefully the driving will improve and everything else will stay as is.

 Q. Did you encounter anything on the course that you didn't notice yesterday?
 ROBIN FREEMAN: No, no. It's just a lot more wind, a lot firmer conditions than yesterday morning. 
 Like I said, I didn't execute my drives especially great, and that put me in some bad places. But other than that, it wasn't too bad a day.
