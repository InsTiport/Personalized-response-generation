 Q. Can you talk a little bit about your first round and first two days at the Masters?   
SHUGO IMAHIRA: I felt I was able to play consistent, one birdie, one bogey on each side, so yeah, very pleased.   
   
 Q. Were the conditions what you expected or were they different? Did you have to adapt your game?   
SHUGO IMAHIRA: As you guys may see, conditions are very soft, so my wedges, iron shots, scoring clubs are staying on the green, unlike last year, so a little bit easier to play.   
   
 Q. Do you feel you have enough energy to play extra holes today?   
SHUGO IMAHIRA: Obviously the last five holes went very smoothly, so more than enough energy to make it through.
