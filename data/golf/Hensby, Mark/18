Q.
Let's just talk about your day out there.

I know you ended poorly, but you did have a good round and put you in probably pretty good position going into the weekend.
MARK HENSBY:  Yeah, I played all right.  It was a disappointing double bogey finish, but overall it was a good day, you know.
Q.  You were behind Maruyama when he made his ace at No. 3.  You made an ace there last year.  Talk about the memories of that, how much fun that was.
MARK HENSBY:  I made a hole in one on No. 3 and I won the tournament, so I told Jeff, who I played with today, that he's destined to win now, there's no doubt.
