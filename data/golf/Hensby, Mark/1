  Q. Just talk about the round today. It was kind of a little up and down?  
 MARK HENSBY: Yeah, I mean, I got to 7 through 10, and to be honest I missed a couple of short putts. That's been a struggle. I've got the yips a little bit when I get the short ones. It happens once and then it kind of rolls on. I made four bogeys in a row and probably one of them was deserved; two of them were a three-putt and one was a short one that I missed.   
 I made a nice eagle on 8 and I hit two nice shots. As I said, from 20 feet I'm all right, but when I get to about three feet, two feet, I don't know, I just freeze. Overall in the middle of the round I was happy.  
  
  Q. How big was that last one?  
 MARK HENSBY: Yeah, good. I just thought to myself, I can make a birdie coming in and have a decent day. I made an eagle, and it was great.  
  
  Q. Did you see any difference in the wind throughout the day or was it consistently gusting in the 25 area?  
 MARK HENSBY: Is that what it was? Yeah, it was gusty. It's funny because you play down and then you play in. I hit a few shots that actually ballooned a little bit, which was kind of surprising because it definitely was stronger than it had been. You know, it's a great golf course. You really have to control your ball and you have to control your flight and consistently hit it close.
