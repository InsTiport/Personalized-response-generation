Q.
Obviously things are going well for you?
MARK HENSBY:  Not too bad.  I've been out here all day, 13 hours right now.  I kind of felt like I had a chance to really play well today, and it was just a long day.
Q.  Had you not played this morning, would you have --
MARK HENSBY:  Absolutely.  The guys who finished yesterday have definitely got an advantage.  I mean, I played with two guys who didn't play later today, but that's the way it goes.
Q.  (Inaudible).
MARK HENSBY:  I wish I knew.  I'm about to find out, though.  No idea.
Q.  (Inaudible).
MARK HENSBY:  Just my patience, I guess.
Q.  What do you predict for tomorrow?
MARK HENSBY:  I think if they play well, where are they, 16?  They're probably going to get to 19.  If they start playing their heart out tomorrow, the course is there for the taking.

It's playing soft, slow, the greens are slow.  It's playing really easy.  The scores are definitely not going to go back up.
Q.  Does it help having been in contention this year?
MARK HENSBY:  It does and it doesn't.  You feel more comfortable than guys who haven't, but on a hard golf course you feel like you'd have a chance, but on a golf course like this you don't when you're that far back.  If you're going to have a miracle round -- (inaudible).
