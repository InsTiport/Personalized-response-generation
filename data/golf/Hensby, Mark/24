Q.
Have you ever won a match 7‑6 before?
MARK HENSBY:  When I was a kid, yeah.  Not for a long time, though.  Yeah, I've won a few matches at 7‑6.
Q.  What was the key today, were you playing really good?
MARK HENSBY:  Yeah, I was 6‑under through 12 holes, so I played good.  I got off to a good start, and when you do that, especially in match play, especially on this golf course, it's pretty hard to come back.
Q.  What was going right for you?  I know the conditions were wet, but they obviously didn't affect you too much.
MARK HENSBY:  No, I hit it close a few times and made a couple of good putts, and then obviously when he hit it close he didn't make it.  So you can only play as good as you can, and they can only do what they can do.  And I was just fortunate that he didn't ‑‑ he had a few chances to actually get within one or two and never did.
Q.  Obviously this is looking long‑term, but it's got to be nice to not play 18 holes, when you could play as many as over a hundred holes in a week, if you had to.  It's nice to take a break early?
MARK HENSBY:  No kidding.  I was sick all last week.  So being able to get done so quickly today was definitely an advantage.
Q.  Talk about the course conditions.  How did it affect you overall?
MARK HENSBY:  Very wet.  The rough is high.  I only missed one fairway, but it's really wet out there.  It's difficult.  The greens are the hardest part, because you could probably chip and have more of a chance.  With all the rain we had, I was surprised we played today, to tell you the truth.
