 Q.   Talk about playing in this event.   
ALEX SMITH:   I'm really excited.   Growing up in California, knowing about the Clambake, going all the way back all those years, it's a special thing.   It's so crazy playing along guys when they're playing in a real tournament.   I couldn't imagine this in any other sport.   It doesn't happen in any other sport.   So fun to be out here, honored to be invited and just looking to have a good time.   
   
 Q.   Will you be nervous?  
ALEX SMITH:   Absolutely.   Yeah.
