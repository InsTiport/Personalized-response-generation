Q. I know you were fighting till the end but just some comments about the match.
BYEONGHUN AN: Just it was unfortunate that I lost. Didn't get anything going today. You know, lost.
Q. Were you watching the leaderboard at all?
BYEONGHUN AN: I was watching it. I knew I had to get a point but I wasn't, you know, watching the board that carefully. I knew I had to make something out of my match. I wasn't playing great. Putts were not going in. But yeah, I knew I had to do something with my match.
Q. How would you describe your first Presidents Cup?
BYEONGHUN AN: It was fun, but it's definitely not fun to lose. It's very disappointing. I don't know if that's what it's going to be, but very disappointing, but first one, got two points, so not too bad.
