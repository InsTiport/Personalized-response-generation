Q. You must be disappointed to lose that match.
BYEONGHUN AN: Yeah, you know, we've got the strongest pairings on their team, so I knew it was going to be hard. It wasn't an easy battle out there and they played amazing golf, and so did we I think.
We played some good golf today. We got a lot of birdies starting on, and they had some birdies starting on. I knew it was going to be tough. It's hard to get a win. They had a good pairing.
But we also believe in ourselves, and we were close to getting the point. You know, we're not going to be too disappointed. It's a team match. I know we lost but we're still leading the tournament. We're in a great spot compared to the last couple years. Our confidence is high, and this definitely is not going to let us down, that's for sure.
Q. How important is it from a psychological level to know that you're going to be ahead going into Saturday?
BYEONGHUN AN: This is massive. Like two years ago, it just wasn't the case, and we know how important this is, these two days. We know how much we wanted this, and I think we're in a great position. I know they are going to fight back tomorrow, but keep our foot on the pedal and just keep making birdies and sticking to the game plan and win our matches.
