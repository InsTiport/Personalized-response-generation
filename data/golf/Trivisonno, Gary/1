 Q. How did your first tournament go?
 GARY TRIVISONNO: I hit the ball pretty well. I was sort of happy with the way I hit it, but I had four 3-putt and a 4-putt. And I shot 6 over. So if I could have putted decent I would have been around par and been happy.

 Q. What do you think affected your game today? The altitude, the wind?
 GARY TRIVISONNO: I don't know, I've been here four days and I think I'm somewhat used to it. But my stroke right now is a little bit off, I don't feel comfortable on the greens. You got to make the putts out here.

 Q. Are you going to go work on your putting?
 GARY TRIVISONNO: Well, if I drive it like I did, I hit it pretty long, so it's not that tough a course if you drive it long, but you got to putt it a little better than I'm doing.
