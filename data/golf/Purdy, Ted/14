Q.
Just talk a little bit about your round today and what it was like out there.
TED PURDY:  Well, I really didn't play real well, but my putter saved me.  I hit a long saving par putt on 8 and a long saving par putt on 14 that kind of held the round together and managed to squeeze in a couple under par.  On this course, anything under par is good.
Q.  You've had two 2nd place finishes on the PGA TOUR.  You're in contention to win tomorrow.  What's the mindset tonight heading into tomorrow?
TED PURDY:  Well, the previous two times I've been leading going into the last day, and I had a tough time sleeping.  You know, I guess just the more you get in the hunt, you more comfortable it becomes.  I'm two shots back, but that's not much on this golf course.

Yeah, I'm right there.  I'm excited about that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TED PURDY:  Yeah, I'm just realizing that it's just another round of golf.  I have to let go of -- you kind of have to let go to win.  You can't really try to win.  You let nature take its course and just try and hit great golf shots.
