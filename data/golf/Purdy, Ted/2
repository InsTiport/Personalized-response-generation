 Q. Ted, nicely done, coming off a late-afternoon 64. You gotta turn it right around and you kept the momentum going. 
 TED PURDY: I did. I seem to play well on this golf course. I've had a couple Top 5s in the past here, and obviously Justin Leonard plays well here. 
 I think if you're familiar and comfortable with your setting, you play well, and it's been fun.

 Q. You're kind of a desert, rocky, hilly kind of player anyway, aren't you, coming from the Phoenix area?
 TED PURDY: That's right. The hotter the better, and it's hot out there, so I'm loving it.

 Q. You're playing well, too. Forget how well you have played here. Fifth place at Quail Hollow, you've got a pretty good mindset right now?
 TED PURDY: Yeah. The last couple of years I've struggled. I started going back to my old ways, and I got a chipping lesson from Phil Mickelson, so that helped me at Quail Hollow, and I'm really looking forward to that, because that was kind of the missing link to me. 
 I've always been a decent ball striker, and my putting's turned around, but my short game always seems to lag. And I've been hitting some beautiful pitches, both last week at Quail Hollow and this week, so I'm excited about upcoming events. 

 Q. What did he show you?
 TED PURDY: Well, he's got this new DVD out.

 Q. You bought the DVD? We'll sell some DVDs for him, then. 
 TED PURDY: Yeah. But honestly, I had 20 birdies at Harbourtown, and I shot 2-under for the tournament. 

 Q. Oh, my gosh. 
 TED PURDY: So my short game was just awful, and I was at the airport in the PGA TOUR shop, and went in and I saw "The Secret of Chipping" by Phil Mickelson. I bought the DVD, and I've been chipping great ever since. 

 Q. Phil, the check better be in the mail soon. You got an endorsement from Ted. Great job today, and good luck this weekend. 
 TED PURDY: I'm grateful. Thanks.
