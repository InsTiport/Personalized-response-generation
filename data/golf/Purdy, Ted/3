  Q. It's a crazy game, as No. 17 and 18 shows there. Take us through, first of all, the putt on 17.   
 TED PURDY: On 17 I had 50 feet, and I was just trying to -- with a lot of break and a fast green I'm just trying to get it close, and it goes in.  
 And on 18 I'm all juiced up and hit it through the fairway, under a tree. I didn't want to go in the creek, so I hit another tree, and ended up making a bogey on the last hole.   
 All in all, I guess par-par finish on 17 and 18 is a good finish, and I know that. If I could have birdied the last hole, who knows what could have happened.  
  
  Q. Were you watching the board out there? It's pretty crazy out there today.   
 TED PURDY: Yeah, this course kind of does it. There's some easy holes, a bunch of easy holes together and you can rack up some birdies, but the last three holes finishing, it's going to be dramatic coming in.  
  
  Q. Good confidence builder for you here?  
 TED PURDY: Yeah, seeing that I'm 500th in the world and I haven't had a Top 10 in a year and a half, it's a big confidence boost.
