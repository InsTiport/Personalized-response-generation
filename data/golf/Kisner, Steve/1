Q. 5-under on the day, 4-under overall.  You made the turn at even par and then caught fire.  Not a bad time to do it, right?KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, it was a cool back nine.  I was hitting great putts for the first 27 holes, and they started going in on the back, capped it off with a bomb on 18.  It was cool.Q. You entered the day 1-over par, and historically when you look back, the cut line normally falls around even, 1-over, so you knew you had to go to work today.  What was your mentality shift from Thursday into Friday?KEVIN KISNER: It was a little bit difficult this morning.  Rough was still wet, hit it in the rough, it was tough to get out of.  But I just got to the back nine, and I said, it's time to go.  Made three in a row to start it and made some nice pars in the middle and finished it off with that birdie.  Obviously it's really bunched up and no telling what'll happen, but put myself in position to have a chance.Q. Conditions looking forward in the afternoon, we saw it get much more challenging as the day went on yesterday.  Where do you anticipate the scores being this afternoon?KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I don't know what the wind is supposed to do, but those last two holes are brutal coming in, 17 and 18, with that wind straight in your face.  But these guys are good.  They'll play well, and I would imagine the cut would be about even and the lead would be about 8- or 9-under.
