 Q.  Great finish, are you happy to finish third here in Dubai?  
MELISSA REID: Absolutely.  I didn't feel like I was swinging it great this week.  Like I said at the start of the week, I need to manage myself well.  We had a game plan and stuck to it, so to finish third is great.   
 Q.  What are you going to do for the rest of the year?  
MELISSA REID: Going snowboarding.
