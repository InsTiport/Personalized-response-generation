Q. (Inaudible.)
MELISSA REID: The girl from America came out strong.  Hopefully they can turn a couple of matches around, but every single point now is important.
Q. On a personal level, you've talked about coming full circle, coming back to Germany, can you just describe your emotions?  You were there with you family.
MELISSA REID: Yeah, it's huge.  I'm so proud of what I've done.  I'm proud of Kevin Craggs, my coach.  He's been an incredible bloke that's come into my life.  My trainer, my manager, my whole family is amazing.  I have a lot of credit to give to them.  You can't deal with the hard work without the support around you and just very lucky I've got that.
Q. This was a really huge win.  You stood over that with 12 feet on the 17th green, you knew it was to win the match.  What was going through your mind at that moment?
MELISSA REID: That was pretty much it.  We read it and it was pretty straight.  I just hit it inside the left.  Yeah, just incredible.  I was really wanting to win that match.  I missed a couple of short putts.
I'm a big fan of Brittany.  She's a lovely, lovely girl, but I had to put that aside a bit.  She's a great competitor, and I'm very happy to get that point on the board for us.
Q. You've been through so much in your personal life since the last time you played in a Solheim Cup.  Were those thoughts, your mom, going through your mind out there today?
MELISSA REID: Yeah, I'm very proud of the circle I've come around in.  I couldn't have done it without the support I've got.  I've got a fantastic family, big family, but they're fantastic.  And a great team, I've got a great trainer, manager, and I've got a fantastic coach in Kevin Craggs.  That guy is great.  He saved my career, so I cannot give enough credit to the guy.
