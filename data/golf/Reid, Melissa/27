 Q. Saturday is known as moving day, how pleased with your move? 
 MELISSA REID: Yeah, I was really pleased. 68 is the best I've shot around here. So all in all quite happy, and it was a good finish to finish with a couple of birdies.

 Q. You made five birdies on each of your three rounds, the previous two you had made too many bogeys and today you eliminated that; what was the key to that?
 MELISSA REID: I hit it really well on the range this morning. I kind of got my rhythm this morning.
 And I was actually a little bit unlucky on 9. I thought I hit a good shot on sand but unfortunately went in the water. I didn't put myself in any trouble and I just played really, really solid today.

 Q. Despite being third in the Order of Merit you're disappointed with your year and you had some opportunities and had not taken them. How much would winning tomorrow change how you feel about this year?
 MELISSA REID: Yeah, it would be a nice little Christmas present, wouldn't it, to win this week. 
 But there's 18 more holes. There's a long way to go. But I've put myself now in a good position so we'll see if I'm in the final group, or second final group; so I know what's going to be happening in front of me. Yeah, another 68 tomorrow would be really nice.
