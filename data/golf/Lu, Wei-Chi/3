Q. Thoughts on the great start?
WEI-CHI LU: First few holes, I was just trying to get into the flow, but after that, started playing really well, and very comfortable today.
Q. And are you comfortable on this golf course?  You seem to be.
WEI-CHI LU: The last couple years, I played well on Fanling.  I really like this course and I hope I will get some better results the rest of the week.
Q. Does this mean you've learned how to play this traditional-style course?
WEI-CHI LU: My home course in Taipei is Taiwan Country Club.  It's very similar to Fanling.  Both are tree-lined, traditional golf courses, and I really enjoy Fanling.
Q. Please put this round into context:  How well have you been playing?
WEI-CHI LU: For the last two years, because of my brain tumor surgery, I can only play two events and then have to rest.  But this is my sixth week, so this is very much a challenge for me; the longest stretch since my surgery.
