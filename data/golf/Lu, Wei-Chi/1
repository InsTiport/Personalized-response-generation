 Q.  Was there a change in the course from the first day?  
WEI-CHI LU: Well, it took me a few holes to get in the flow, just like the first round.  But then after a few holes, I started getting very confident and got a few birdies.  But toward the end of the round, physically, I feel pretty tired and most of the drive, I end up in the rough.  But fortunately, I kind of save a few pars coming hope.   
 Q.  And your energy levels, is that purely down to your preparation and the recuperation?  
WEI-CHI LU: Toward the end of the round, I feel tired and then my lower body is not as stable as I'd like to.  And then a few awkward drive with not the result I would like, but luckily I finished with a few pars.   
 Q.  How does the heat affect you, because it saps everybody's strength.  Does it affect you all the more?  
WEI-CHI LU: If it really gets warmer, I will probably use an umbrella.  But even when I play during the round, when it's not my turn, I always try to find the shade and hide under the trees and just save my energy.   
 Q.  Are your energy levels going to be boosted by the fact that you're in a lovely position and you'll be in a great group tomorrow.  
WEI-CHI LU: I don't want to think too much about playing maybe in the last few groups and possibly with Poulter, because I just want to treat it like another normal round and play shot by shot and try to save my energy for the weekend.   
 Q.  What, though, is your experience playing with the big names?  Do you enjoy that?  Do you rise to that occasion?  
WEI-CHI LU: At the World Cup, I played with Ian Poulter before in the same flight, and also Angel Cabrera and Fred Couples.   
And normally, I would like to watch them when they play, but I try not to think too much about it.  Just stay focused and play my own game.
