Q. Josh, another great round today.  Tell us about your round out there.
JOSH SCOBEE:   Well, I started out pretty poorly.  I had another double.  Apparently I like to double one of the first three holes on this course for some random reason.
But I got it started on the back nine and had like three or four birdies.  Had a fun round, so...
Especially finishing off with the birdie on 18 there in front of everyone.
Q. Thoughts going into the final round?
JOSH SCOBEE:   Going to be quite a few points behind Mardy, so just trying to make a birdie on every hole and go out there and play aggressive and enjoy the day.
That's the most important part about this, is enjoying day and obviously raising money for the charities and the meaning behind everything, just having fun.
Q. That putt on 18, did it go exactly as you read it?
JOSH SCOBEE:   The fun part about that putt was I lined the ball up with a red line on my putter, so when I putt it and I see it roll end over end I know I've hit a good putt and I've read it well if it goes in.
But that one was 50-something feet, and I had just run up there really fast and was going to putt it.  My caddie says, All right, it's probably about a cup out right, and I hit it on that line and as I'm watching it I'm like, This is going to go in.  He's like, Oh, it's in.  About halfway there, boom, went in.
So that was a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.
