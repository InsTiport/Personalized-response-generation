Q. Can you walk us through your round today? How was your game? What were the highlights of today? 
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Very good. It's my first round out here, and just tried to get it all in. A little bit of a rain delay at the start, but a really good round. 

Q. The best moment of your round, what would it be? 
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Birdieing 18 was really nice to cap it off. 

Q. And then what did you learn today that you can apply for the next days, for the next few days? 
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I mean, I think the golf course will play a bit different because it rained today, and I think the weather is going to turn out for us on the weekend, so we'll see how much it changed. I'm looking forward to it.
