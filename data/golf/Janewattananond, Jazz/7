JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Arrive here on Monday, it was raining.  Tuesday was raining.  The course plays so tough because the rough was so long, the ball don't go anywhere.  I was having a nightmare.  How am I going to play this golf course?  I'm not going to break 80.  This exceed my expectation already.
Q. Have you ever played golf (indiscernible) before?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yes, I did.  Two years ago in the Colonial, Dean & DeLuca Open.  This is my second time.  This is my first time on the East Coast, and it's next level.  It's so different.  I love it.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: People keep shouting love you.  They love me here.
Q. What's the most interesting thing you've heard from the crowd?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Trying to say my last neighboring.  I heard all sorts.  Some pretty good ones.  I don't want to remember it.
Q. How do you say it?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's supposed to be Janewattananond.  But I heard some really funny ones.  So, yeah, keep it coming.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, I mean, it's like every Thai or every Buddhist, if you're that religion, you have to go to it when you're 21, when you turn 21, and I did that.  The king has past away, the last king.  That was just for the king.  I didn't expect it to be better for myself, but it turns out but it make me more peaceful, not trying as hard on the golf course because there's so many other big things around our lives.
Q. (Indiscernible) turn pro?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I have to say because in Asia, we struggle to get a good amateur event.  Like America you have AJGA or you have college golf.  We don't have it there.  I play some over here, and it's amazing.  It's Junior World.  I play a couple of them here.  Back in Thailand, back in Asia, we don't have that.  We play once a month.  Once a month is good.  Sometimes we don't have it for three or four months.  So turning pro is kind of like getting yourself into more tournaments, but you're not really playing it.  You still feel like an amateur playing a tournament.
Q. How old (indiscernible)?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: 15.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's good.  He's a local here, so he brought so much fans around.  Maybe that's part of the reason why New York love me.  Must be the caddie.
Q. Have you thought about the Presidents Cup?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, it's on the back of my mind.  It's on the back of my mind for sure.  I played with Ernie a couple weeks back, and he just told me to keep playing good.  So I'll see about that.
