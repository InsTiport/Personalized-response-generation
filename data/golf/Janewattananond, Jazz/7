 Q.  Jazz, your thoughts on starting with 70 today.  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, it's a better start an the last two events I had. I'm pretty happy with my round. Just a couple mistake, but it's the first time playing this golf course. So we'll learn and we'll adapt.   
 Q.  Now that you've played your first competitive round here at Sheshan, I'm sure you know how to tackle the course for the next three days?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I hope so. I hope I get an idea how to play better tomorrow and for the rest of the week. It's a tough course and it's demanding, so it's going to be fun.   
 Q.  At the start of the week, you talk about trying to get back to your A Game. Do you think it started coming back after today?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's not yet but I feel it's coming. It's either coming this week or, I mean -- hope it come this week but it's on the right track to getting there.   
 Q.  What do you think is needed to actually tackle this challenging Sheshan golf course?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Just need to hit a lot of greens. The rough is pretty high here, so just need to hit a lot of fairways.   
 Q.  And any positive you take out from today's round?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, I managed to get a good couple up-and-down and make some good birdies. We'll take that as a positive and use it for the next three rounds.
