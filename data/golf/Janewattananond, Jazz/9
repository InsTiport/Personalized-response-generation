 Q.  Thailand, you have an event there last weekend?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: No, just home.  Thailand is home for me.   
 Q.  When you do that, how do you find a place to stay?  Who take care of that?  Your agent?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: We got internet now.  I got a couple friends out here, living here, so they helped me out with it.   
 Q.  Has that added to your comforted level coming in, having the friends, so you have some support?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, for sure.  I arrived last Friday.  I go out with my friends.  He's from Jersey, so he's local.  Take me out to see all of Manhattan, what's it all about.  Kind of a wow moment.  Maybe I didn't get over that.  I didn't feel the pressure on the golf course.   
 Q.  How wowed you the most about Manhattan?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: The people.   
 Q.  So many people.  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: And the buildings.  It's like a country jungle.   
 Q.  Starting to get a lot of people out on the course.  What do you think about the atmosphere here?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I love it.  My first time ever getting a crowd like this, shouting my name.  I don't know how to react to it.  This is my first time for the shouting.  They give me some really funny names.  I try not to remember it.   
 Q.  They didn't shout your last name, did they?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: No, no.  They did try.  It didn't come out right.   
 Q.  How do you pronounce it?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's Janewattananond.   
 Q.  You look -- looking at your card, look like you found trouble, but you always found a way to get out of the trouble.  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, if you're in the rough here, you just got to take your medicine, try to get it back in the short stuff.  If you don't, you just try to get it, you know -- don't go over bogey.  That's all you need to know.   
 Q.  How much -- your father nicknamed you Jazz because of the music.  Still involved with that?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: My father loved jazz music.  Apparently didn't come through me.  But, yeah, I like all kinds of music.  Maybe the name helps.   
 Q.  Just how much fun is all this?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's great, coming out here, interacting with all the crowds.  It's crazy.  I love it.  I just want to remember everything.   
 Q.  When you got the invite, were you invited because of your ranking, or because of the special invite?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: World ranking.  It's the first events that I did in America with my own ranking, so that feels pretty good to be here.  You feel like you belong.
