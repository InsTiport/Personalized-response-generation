Q. Jazz, very much improved for the second round?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, probably isn't see it in the score because the course played a bit tougher than yesterday. Left a couple out there, but all in all, still a pretty good round.
Q. In quite a good position going into the weekend round?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, I think I put myself in a good position to move up for sure. It's a good start to a really good week.
Q. What do you think of your WGC experience so far?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I love it. It's my first time and I really enjoy it. I'm looking forward to play more in the future.
Q. I mean, have you set -- with your position, have you set any goals come Sunday where you would like to see yourself after the results in Korea, Japan?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I mean, I'm really happy that I'm not -- after what I did in Korea and Japan, even though there's no cut, you want to finish up. You're playing against the best players and you just want to prove to yourself, I can play too.
Q. With the consistency since the start of the year, I'm sure you're hoping to end it off with a big bang?
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I hope so. I have a couple more Asian Tour tournaments to come. I'm just trying to get my game to peak to the next level and just work on the stuff I'm not really that good. For now, putting is a big key to improve my game, so that's what I've been working on.
