 Q.  69. Keeps getting better and better, pushing yourself in the Top-10.  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, it was a pretty easy 3-under. Missed a lot of putts. Happy with the way I'm swinging it and hopefully I continue to hit it like this tomorrow and make more putts.   
 Q.  Is a Top-10 finish on your mind?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, try to do my best. Try to finish as high as I can and you know, try to get this positiveness tomorrow. Try to grind it out.   
 Q.  Obviously as a World Golf Championships, a lot of World Ranking points which will be important?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, my goal is to end the year inside the Top-50, so this is going to be a good opportunity to put myself closer to that goal. I mean, I have a lot of tournaments left, so no pressure on me.   
 Q.  Any key highlights you can take pride in?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Not so much, hit a lot of greens, had a lot of chances. Didn't take advantage of it, but still a pretty good round and a pretty good score.
