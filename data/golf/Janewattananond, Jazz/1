JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: I'm really happy that I came here and made the cut on the first time. I really enjoyed the first two days. So I'm just going to try to enjoy the last two days as well.


JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Just being here is the best part probably. You work your way towards getting in the Masters, and then you come here, and you really fulfill it.
