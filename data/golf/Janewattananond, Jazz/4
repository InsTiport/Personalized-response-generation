 Q.  After three very high-profile events in Korea, Japan and China, you have your best result here this week?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, I was struggling a lot the first two weeks but just found a bit of momentum on this week. Just still couldn't get over my putting. Could have been a lot better. Hit it good this week. Still, I'm really happy with the result, first WGC, looks like it's going to be Top 15.   
 Q.  Probably a Top 15 finish, but obviously a nice feeling to know that you can play in these events with the best players in the world?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Yeah, it's still a process of learning and try to get there and try to play week-in and week-out like this is going to be demanding. I still need to improve but now I know what I need to improve on more.   
 Q.  If you look back on this year, so many high-profile events, a lot of global attention; how are you taking all of this?  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: It's fun. It's good experience. I played in Japan where we have a lot of spectators. It's good.   
 Q.  Looking back closer to the region, leading The Asian Tour Order of Merit, that's something you want to clinch very soon, as well.  
JAZZ JANEWATTANANOND: Well, Scott Hend, he's a good player, so we'll see.
