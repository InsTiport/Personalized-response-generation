 Q.  Two pretty good 3-under rounds.  Brittany just seems to be lighting it up.  Where do you think you stand and how do you assess somebody shooting that well on this golf course?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, I think if somebody able to shot like 8-under, 9-under like Amy yesterday, and then when you're seeing player like Brittany playing 6-under; 6-under maybe she has more chance to make more birdies, and that means I can do it for next two days as well.   
I think you just got to have a positive attitude.  You can shot some low score and just do your best.   
 Q.  What was working out there?  What has been working last couple weeks?  
SO YEON RYU: I think my first three hole, I mean, was quite tough hole.  I didn't really hit well, but I think my chip shot and putter was really work well, so I was really glad I was able to make up and down for three in a row.   
Then after that I sort of have more motivate to make a birdie.  That's how I made birdie at No.4.   
To be honest, during the Asian swing I wasn't happy with my shot at all, but looks like after I worked with my coach last week it started to back to in great shape.  Hopefully next two days is going to be even better shape.
