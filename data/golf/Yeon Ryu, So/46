Q. How was your round today?  You scored a 65.  Much better out on the course today?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, of course, everything was much better, but I still missed a few birdie putts.  But I was still able to shoot 5-under, which is I think positive because that means I won't be hitting lower than 5-under.  Look forward to have one more low round tomorrow.
Q. What's your goal tomorrow?
SO YEON RYU: Right now my goal is finishing Top-10.  Right now I guess maybe I'm not in the Top-10 right now but I'm going to do my best tomorrow and I'm going to bring my A Game out tomorrow and then hopefully I can finish my Top-10.
