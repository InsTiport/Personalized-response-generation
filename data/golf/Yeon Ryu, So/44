 Q.  4-under today.  You happy with your round?  
SO YEON RYU: Actually putting was little better than yesterday, but I couldn't really make lot of putts.   
Putting was only disappointing part of my game today.  Hopefully I can make more putt tomorrow.   
 Q.  How is the shoulder holding up?  
SO YEON RYU: It's still little tight, but compared to like Tuesday, Wednesday it's much, much better.  I think I'm on the right track.   
 Q.  Looked like you tensed a little bit here on the last hole.  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah.  Like after I finish my front nine I started to feel like fatigued and tight.   
But if you look at my long game I think it was pretty good, so I think shoulder is holding up pretty great.   
 Q.  Your ball striking is as good as it's been all year, hasn't it?  
SO YEON RYU: I think so.  I think so also I'm hitting still long.  I mean, not shorter.  So I think long game a good enough now.   
 Q.  You had an eagle.  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah.  Actually that was really awkward, because I saw I hit the flag, but I didn't see the draw.  I just couldn't see any ball.  Everybody was like, Where is the ball?  And then, you know, the spectators started to clap, so that's how I knew it was an eagle.   
So that was strange, but I'll take it.
