 Q.  Early morning start.  Is everything okay with the game?  Do you like your position on the leaderboard?  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, for sure.  To be honest, I think I took advantage to playing the morning, because compared to yesterday there was literally no wind.  So it was much easier to select a club and then it was much easier to decide what kind of shot I was going to hit.   
And then I think the golf course is still in great shape after all that rain and everything.  So I'm really happy with my position so looking forward to making more birdies this weekend.   
 Q.  You say the golf course is in good shape.  Is your game in the shape you want it to be?  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah.  Actually, until yesterday, my putting wasn't really great.  But I think this morning, the putting turned out pretty great so I am looking forward to dropping a lot of putts.
