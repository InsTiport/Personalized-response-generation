Q. So Yeon, opening with a 4-under.  Bogey at the last, but still nonetheless, 4-under and in good shape in a major championship.  Is that a much of feeling of relief or encouragement?
SO YEON RYU: I would say both.  I think it's definitely relief to shot 60s in the first round, but at the same time because I finish with the bogey that was a bit more encouragement.
But, well, I feel like I really had some lot of great shots, and even though I couldn't make like all of them I had a really great putt as well.
So I feel really comfortable to heading into the like second round tomorrow.
Q. You have your entire management team here watching you.  You were probably No. 1 in terms of the most pre-tournament publicity as a favorite to win.  Does that add pressure in your mind?
SO YEON RYU: Yes and no, because, you know, like when everybody first start talking about like you should win the tournament or win the major, last major of the year, and then win the RAMA award.
But at the same time, you're better to got some attention instead of nothing.
So I think I'm very blessed.  Hopefully I can do something really great.  Then I just want to pay back a lot of people who were encouraging me and supporting me.
