Q. So what did it mean to you to win the Rolex ANNIKA Major Award?
SO YEON RYU: First of all, I'm so honored to this have award, especially after named after one of the greatest women's golfers in our golf history.
The other thing is I think the play in the major is fortunate enough, because it's really tough to contend in a tournament, as well.  But at the same time, it's truly an honor to have this award because that means I was able to handle all of the major tournaments.
You know, Major Award is always a tough challenge and I feel like if I play well at the major tournaments, I always feel like my game just top of the world.  So I feel very fortunate to be a professional golfer and yeah, it's very special to have this honor.
Q. How far do you feel like you've come as a player, starting to win majors and becoming the No. 1 player in the world and now this award?
SO YEON RYU: Well, still kind of living the dream.  I always dreamed to become a Major Champion and then being No. 1 and also got the ANNIKA Major Award, as well.  I just dream about it, but it just never really feels like it's a dream come true but it's a dream come true.  It still feels like, is it a dream or real.  I'm definitely amazed by it.
I think I definitely feel like I'm very fortunate to be part of it, and that one gave me also extra motivation to keep going hard.
Q. I don't know if this was a goal for you, and if it was, and now you've achieved it, what's your next goal?
SO YEON RYU: Like before this tournament, my goal was I wanted to win another major, but it's done.  I think hopefully until the CME, hopefully I can play really well, and then going to win the CME, Race to the CME Globe.
