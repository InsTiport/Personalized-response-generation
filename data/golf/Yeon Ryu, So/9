(In progress.)
SO YEON RYU: I think most importantly I was really comfortable to hitting every single shot like from the tee to the green.  I think that's more better thing.
Then, yeah, maybe if I was able to make more birdies maybe I was close to Lexi, but Lexi played really, really well this week.  I'm happy for her.
Q. Did you have the Cab again last night?
SO YEON RYU: No.
Q. Awesome finish.
SO YEON RYU: Thank you very much.
Q. How does it feel to finally be done with the season after such a great season?
SO YEON RYU: First of all, I'm so glad to finish my season with a bogey-free round.  That's the best way to finish the season for sure.  I'm so thankful to have so many peoples around me and that I was surrounded by so many amazing peoples, including all my fellow LPGA players and LPGA staff.
I had a good time and bad time this year, but I guess most of the time was good time.  The biggest thing I learned this year was I really have to be myself.  I cannot really think everybody -- I mean, I cannot really take everybody's opinion.  I think that's one of the biggest lesson I had.
Well, I've won once, but I'm looking forward to have more multiple winning for 2019.  Olympics coming up, so I want to put myself in a good position for Team Korea.
Q. What are your plans for the off-season?
SO YEON RYU: So I'm going to play tournament next week in Korea.  It's called Champions Trophy.  It's KLPGA versus LPGA Korean players.  This year going to be a little because we going to have some like -- the Korean players, but not actual Korean players.
I think right now we have really, really great teammate, and I'm looking forward to having that trophy.  I'm going to -- my plan is going to do nothing.  I think that's the best way to do it.
