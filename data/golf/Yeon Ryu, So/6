 Q.  Good round.  
SO YEON RYU: Thank you.  Yeah, I guess that's my first bogey-free round this year.  I think putted really great today.  I made a few six-foot par putt, which is really great.   
Also I was really happy to make a par at the last hole as well.   
Only thing I can complain is maybe my tee shot was not great enough, so I'm going to working on it.  And then, well, even though I didn't really hit a lot of fairways, my iron shot was good enough to make a lot of birdie opportunity, so that was lucky.   
But I want to make sure I'm going to hit a lot of fairways tomorrow as well.   
 Q.  That's your best first-round score her at the Lotte Championship.  
SO YEON RYU: Is it?   
 Q.  And this is your eighth year.  Yeah.  
SO YEON RYU: I never know, but I always love to come here.  One of the reasons why I love to come here is just like -- well, it's really hard to find some enjoyment off the golf course when we are traveling.  But here, like once you're off the golf course like so many great things around, and then I totally feel like I can make really, really good balance between my personal life and golfer's life.   
That's one the main focus I been trying hard to have it.  So I just love to be here.  Hopefully I can have this kind of golf for the rest of the rounds as well.   
 Q.  What is there to do off the course when you're in Hawaii?  
SO YEON RYU: First of all, I really enjoy the going to the coffee shop, acai bowl, and then I always love to read a book just beside a beach.  Then yesterday (indiscernible) and Pernilla, like three of us is really good friend, and then we had just kind of like a snack time on the beach.   
Beach just does everything.  We can do everything with that beach.  We can run, we can ride a boat, we can swim, just everything.   
 Q.  Finishing up with a birdie on par-3 over here, right?  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah.  You know, depends on pin position that hole could be really tough.  Could be one of the birdie opportunity hole.  I think today pin position was one of the easiest pin position for that green, so I'm really happy I was able to make a birdie.   
I think finish -- well, because the afternoon wave haven't tee'd off yet so I don't know how it's going to be, but at least right now I'm in contention.  Definitely that birdie really helped me out to get me in contention.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah.  I think 17 and 18 was one of the important part of the day for sure.   
 Q.  How do you feel the wind was today?  Not as strong as you expected?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, normally morning is really calm and then it's getting like stronger, but I think maybe all the morning was really strong and then sort of dies down and then strong again.   
So I think, to be honest, weather was bit weird, because we had some like heavy rain as well.   
 Q.  Do you feel relieved that your game came together today?  
SO YEON RYU: I think I'm just more matter of my mentality.  I think.  I don't know.  Really hard to say because I only played one round of golf this week.  At least right now I feel like I'm not really frustrating by every shot.   
That's what I feel for like last few tournament.  I got so frustrated after hitting one bad shot.  Then right now I'm having like as long as I did my best for the shot, like no matter result I'm just going to get over it.   
Then if it's really necessary to working on it, I'm just going to do it after round on the range instead of like trying to figure it out on the golf course.   
So I just sort of kind of like had like agreement just by myself so like Tuesday is a grinding day, and I'm going to try to have at least one day off, which is maybe Monday.  Then once I start to playing like pro-am and everything I just want to be like playing mode instead of just think about the technique too much.   
 Q.  A quick question about Sei Young.  Anything she does surprise you anymore?  
SO YEON RYU: I feel like she's really good at what we cannot do.  So every time when she does something spectacular, for example like shot 31 to win the tournament or made an eagle to win the playoff, it's Sei Young.  You're not surprised anymore.
