Q. So Yeon, first of all, you start off with a level par 72 here; you've had 68 for the last two rounds.  What's been the big difference in your game the last two days?
SO YEON RYU: The first round my shot wasn't really great so I couldn't really make enough birdie chance.  And because of my shot wasn't in good shape, I just couldn't fully focus on like putting and I think that was a problem to why I couldn't hit under par.
After I finished first round I practiced some long game and then I figured out what was the problem, and then that key point worked it out really well for yesterday and today.
So that is how I was able to shot 4-under par last two days.  Hopefully I can make more birdies for tomorrow as well.
Q. What was the highlight of your round today?
SO YEON RYU: Actually nothing fancy, but just I was able to made really, really great opportunity to make an eagle on the last hole.  It was about a ten-foot eagle putt but I just missed it.
I know it's not like really exciting putt because I missed it, but I should say that was the highlight of my round.
Q. There is a mathematical chance you might lose the No. 1 ranking depending on what happens tomorrow.  The only way you can lose it is if Sung Young wins.  How do you feel about that and is that something that concerns you at all?
SO YEON RYU: First of all, I cannot control who is going to win the tournament.  Whoever win the tournament, well-deserve.  So if even if Sung Young going to win and I cannot keep my position, you know, nothing I can complain.
Maybe I should just complain myself I couldn't win.  And then I think even though if I'm going to lose my spot, that's maybe another motivate, so I just keep practice well and keep practice hard and keep just working hard.
Might going to be feel weird to being 2nd after I'm being No. 1 for more than couple months, but right now what I'm really interested in and I just want to enjoy my game, which means if I'm going to get back to my like ideal swing, I'm going to be have more positive mind and be more fun to play and it's going to bring me to win the tournament.
So I really don't care about it much right now.  Only concern I have is just my game.
