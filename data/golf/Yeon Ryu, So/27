Q. A round of 72.  Felt like a bit of a battle out there?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, compared to the first two days, it was really, really tough and it was really, really tough to judge all the shots, and it was really tough to do tee shots, second shot.
I think plus one is still a really great score out there, and then I'm really proud of myself to how I played around the green, especially when it's really windy, it's better to have a lot of putting than chipping around the green.  And my putting outside of the green was pretty phenomenal today, so I give credit to myself.
Q. You finish with a birdie to give you some confidence going into tomorrow.  How did that mean to stay in touch with the leader?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, like one stroke is still huge for the last round, so always welcome to make a birdie and always welcome to finish birdie with a round.  I think so far, I'm lying three shots back and if the weather is going to be like this, we don't really know what's going on.
So fingers crossed for me.
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, would you prefer the weather to be like this again?
SO YEON RYU: You know, to be honest, better not to have this kind of wind.  Better to be calm and sunny, but it is what it is.  We are here for a links-style golf course and sometimes hitting in wind is more fun to play links golf.  I think better to have my attitude as whatever it comes, I will take it.
Q. Looking ahead to next week, the RICOH Women's British Open, a Major Championship, are you pleased with the conditions ahead of that?  Does it bed you in to what's to come?
SO YEON RYU: Well, of course, we can practise, but practise and actually playing tournaments are quite different.  I think it's a really, really great tournament to prepare, the British Women's Open, but it's not only preparation.  For sure I want to focus on this tournament.  The tough weather kind of give me more idea to how I'm going to practise for The Open.
