  Q. Six birdies today, 5-under.  Take us through maybe one the most memorable birdies that you had out there.
 SO YEON RYU:   Well, first of all, I'm very disappointed with my last hole because that was -- my par putt was only probably like two foot and then I missed it.  So it's really disappointed I couldn't finish with the bogey free round, but 67 cannot be complain.  I'm happy with the 67.
 And I guess my first birdie just really helped me out to boost me up.  I think that was No.4, about like 12 feet left to right putt.
 I been actually struggle with the putting for last three days, and then when you make that kind of length putt it's just immediately can give yourself the confidence.
 So I want to think that putt was the best putt, and then best birdie I made this week.
 Q. Can you take more positives from today, especially the run you made into the first major of the year?
 SO YEON RYU:   Oh, yeah, of course.  I actually struggle with the speed control on the green the first two days, so I actually switched to the new putter on Saturday, and then actually that help me out a lot.
 So I'm really excited to use my new putter, and then right now speed control is much better than first two rounds.  So look forward to playing ANA Inspiration.  Especially always feel good to come back as a past champion, so hopefully I can bring on the my A game.
 Q. What new putter did you use?
 SO YEON RYU:   Scotty Cameron.  I actually don't know the model exactly.  Something like 11.5, I guess.
 Q. Scotty Cameron is a good one.  What is it about this kind of the west coast swing especially with ANA obviously that gets you amped up?
 SO YEON RYU:   I used to live in west coast so I always feel more comfortable to being in the west coast.  Beautiful weather, so many good restaurants around, which is really pity because with COVID we cannot really visit restaurants.
 Still like every time when I'm in west coast I really get to the good vibe, and it's really good to drive to the next tournament as well, so I'm looking forward to that.
 I think because I came back to the States last November and then Dallas, Houston was really, really cold weather and after playing CME I had t go back to Korea and then I had to play with really cold weather again, and then right now I' playing with beautiful weather.  Every day is blessing.
