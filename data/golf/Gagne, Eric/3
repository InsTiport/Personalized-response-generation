 Q. You're one of the favorites of this event. Besides you, of course, who else do you see in the hunt for this thing?   
ERIC GAGNE: I think Mulder. I play with him a lot, and his game is on point right now. And Mark Rypien again, Billy Joe [Tolliver]. These guys just know how to putt and they know their way around. They'll be really, really hard to beat. And I think Modano has been playing good too. He might be a sleeper.  
   
 Q. What about you? How's the distance?   
ERIC GAGNE: Of course I'm the favorite, I hope. In my head, I'm the best. It will be fun. Good guys, good players.
