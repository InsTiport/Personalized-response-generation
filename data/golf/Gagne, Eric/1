 Q.  So great round today.  How do you feel it's going to hold up?  
ERIC GAGNE: Thank you.  I'll be top ten probably.  I feel good.  It was fun.  I felt I could have played a lot better.  I had great partners.  It was a lot of fun.   
Diamond Resorts puts up such a great event now, it feels like we're PGA players.  It's first class.  It's fun.  Just to be here, it's a great honor.  Just happy to be here.  I had a good day today.  I had fun.  As long as I have fun and I don't shank on 18, I'm happy.   
 Q.  So what is it that you think helps translate from baseball to golf?  Because you're pretty good.  
ERIC GAGNE: I mean, I think mostly it's more of like the mental attitude.  You go out there and just we're not as good as we think we are.  We've got to go out there and keep grinding, not quitting.  I think it's a little like baseball.  You're looking for perfection, but you'll never get it.   
I think for me just going out there, enjoying the day.  The company was amazing.  A lot of fans out there.  It's a great tournament.  Happy to be here.   
 Q.  It doesn't hurt that it's at Disney too?  
ERIC GAGNE: It's unbelievable.  First class everything.  I'm glad now we have the girls here, LPGA.  It's so much fun to see them swing.  Such a pretty swing.  You watch that, and you learn a lot.  For us, it's fun.
