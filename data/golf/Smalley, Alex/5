 Q.  Your overall thoughts on your opening round here?  
ALEX SMALLEY: I played really well.  I didn't put any stress on any parts of my game.  I was pretty consistent all day, and just hit good shots all the way around.   
 Q.  Does it help posting a good number here, less stress to post a low number to make match play on the harder South Course tomorrow?  
ALEX SMALLEY: I mean, you could say that, but I just have to play the same way I did today and then I won't have to worry about anything like that.  I think the goal is just to do the same thing tomorrow, try to do the same thing tomorrow.   
 Q.  You posted a clean card; any shots that stand out from any of your birdie holes?  Take me through the birdie holes:  2, 3, 4, 12 and 13.  
ALEX SMALLEY: Yeah, so No. 2 I hit a good shot because the pin was back right on a little shelf, hit it to five feet, made that.  No. 3, almost made my second shot, about six inches or so, tapped in for birdie.  No. 4 was a tough hole, and I just hit a good 5-iron up there and made a putt.  And then hole No. 12, a par-5, hit a good wedge in there, made birdie, about 15 feet or so.  And then on 13 hit a good iron shot and had a straight uphill putt for birdie.   
 Q.  You were 2-under on the par-3s, so obviously your iron play is solid right now?  
ALEX SMALLEY: Uh-huh, yeah, it's really solid.  I think I hit all 18 greens today.  Like I said, I didn't put any stress on any parts of my game today, which kind of helped me go through it.
