 Q. What did you have for breakfast this morning? I want to have some of that. Birdied five of the first six holes. Great start.
 SUNGHOON KANG: I actually had Korean food this morning. I had some Cheetos last night and I really had a good breakfast today and I really felt good in the morning.
 And I really had a good start from the front nine, and I thought the pin placement was really tough today. The greens are rock hard and really fast, so yeah, I couldn't get the right speed and I was having trouble with my putter on the back side.

 Q. Hard to get it close on the back side. Nobody's made a whole lot of birdies on this front nine, even the leaders. They're looking forward to playing the nine that you played first. Was it easier the first nine you played?
 SUNGHOON KANG: The first nine I was hitting it right next to the hole; like five or more were like three feet away. So I just hit it really good on the back side today.
 And then like front nine, my back side I didn't really hit it -- I couldn't really hit it close because some holes I really made it to the fairways, but I really didn't hit the fairways. In the rough and greens really fast, I couldn't get it close to the hole.

 Q. You talked yesterday about how you're not afraid of Q-School because you've been through it twice. Looks like you may, if you keep this up, avoid it altogether. That would be great, wouldn't it?
 SUNGHOON KANG: I'm just trying to play this tournament like Q-School.

 Q. Are you?
 SUNGHOON KANG: I'm in the right spot right now. So yeah, I think this is less pressure than Q-School, so I hope I play a little better than today for tomorrow. So hopefully I'll have a spot for next year.

 Q. Finish it off. Keep smiling. You had fun playing with Woody today, I know. Congratulations.
 SUNGHOON KANG: I did. Thank you. Appreciate it.
