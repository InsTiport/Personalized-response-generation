   SUNGHOON KANG: I needed to make at least tied for third or solo fourth. I was like tied for seventh. I knew that 14-under was tied for fourth. If I make it, I might have chance. That's what I thought.   
 So I had opportunity for birdie at the last hole for an 8-footer. Fortunately, two guys were behind me. They all show me the break. So it was more than that, but the guys' ball didn't really broke that much, so I hit a little left and just barely like lipped in.   
  
  Q. You went in 133 projected to 122 by making that putt. That kept you your card.   
 SUNGHOON KANG: All right. That's what I thought. Okay. So I'm really happy to be having my TOUR card for next year. I don't know, it just feels -- I mean, I'm just dreaming right now. That's what I feel.   
  
  Q. Dreaming at Disney. What did you hit in on the last hole?  
 SUNGHOON KANG: 6-iron from 195. Actually I had great driver. It kind of kicked left and I really had a bad lie in the first cut. Someone hit it and my ball was in there, so I didn't know what the ball was the going to do.   
  
  Q. The ball was in the divot?   
 SUNGHOON KANG: It kind of divots, like some grass behind my ball and I didn't know if it was going to be a flyer or if it was going to be a normal shot. So I just took the 6-iron out and just hit it and just see what happens.  
  
  Q. How nervous were you playing today with the card on the line?  
 SUNGHOON KANG: I was really nervous. Because if I just had good day today, I will be okay. If I just have bad day today, I'm not really okay.  
 So I mean, one day can't change my life. That's what I thought. So I really tried to do my best today. It worked. Actually, I had some chances before, but I missed a lot of 'em.   
  
  Q. Did you sleep well? Eat well?   
 SUNGHOON KANG: I slept okay.
