  DOUG GHIM: I made my first eagle on 18, and I'm pretty sure I get a crystal on this. I asked Mr. Lyle, is it true you get a trophy for this? And he goes, oh, yeah, one for the trophy case. 
I'm excited that no matter what happens this week I'm going to go home with something with my name on it from the Masters, and not from the pro shop. I'm excited about that. 
But the one on 18, again, I just‑‑ it was incredible. I was fortunate enough to have it there to commit to a shot. I hit a great drive, and had a good number. 

Q. What was your number?
DOUG GHIM: 188 to the hole. And I flushed it, I hit a great 6‑iron. Other than the second shot on 13, it was the best shot I hit all day. 

Q. Did you see it?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, we were way below the green level, and I figured it looked like it had enough on it, and then the crowd started clapping and then all of a sudden they were all up. And I knew that it went in. And I turned around and my dad was running at me full speed. It's a moment I'll never forget.

Q. Did you catch him in a hug or did he jump into your arms?
DOUG GHIM: He jumped. We've had a situation like that before, it's like I'm not going to jump. I saw what happened yesterday on the par‑3. I'm glad he's playing, and I'm glad he's playing well. But I just didn't want that happened to happen to me.

Q. Were you getting worried when your dad came running?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah. It was very exciting for me and him. It was incredible.

Q. Where is your Cubs hat?
DOUG GHIM: I would love to wear a Cubs hat this week, but I promised coach I'd wear Longhorns on my head. I wouldn't be wearing it on my chest. But I got it up here, but still room for the Cubs. Happy that they won on opening day. Haven't really kept track. I think we're doing fine. 

Q. At 13 it was a hybrid to how close?
DOUG GHIM: 13 I had 220 to the hole and I hit a hybrid to about seven feet and high. And I didn't think it was possible for me to land a hybrid that softly. The greens are getting pretty firm. But somehow the ball landed where it did and left me a real easy putt up the hill. And I was fortunate to feel my hands enough to feel that putt.

Q. What are your plans for it the summer?
DOUG GHIM: Plans are just playing more golf. Planning to turn pro after the U.S. Open, I'll be playing there as an amateur. And, yeah, embarking on a new journey. 

Q. Are you ready for this life?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, I knew it was going to be tough to start, because I never played in a pro event before. I played the Genesis Collegiate Shoot Out at Riviera during that week. But it's not on the same scale as this, obviously. And this is my favorite tournament ever. I mean I would watch the whole telecast, and if I couldn't, I would watch the replays. I'm very thankful that Masters.com decided to put on the last 50 final rounds. I'm going to be watching all of those at one point. 
But to be here, and be playing, I was so nervous, and it means a lot to me to be here. And I understand how important and how big of a blessing it is to have the opportunity here. And I just wanted to make sure that I would make people proud and my golf proud.

Q. You said Monday in Austin you brought confidence, and you aren't going to sell yourself short?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, it's an incredible golf course, one guy could shot 78 one day and 63 the next day. I'm going to try my best to put my ball in the right position. As many stress free pars as I can get out there, and if I can get a look at birdie, that would be great. 

Q. Did Spieth give you a little assist?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, I got to play with him Monday and during the practice rounds, and he was nothing but kind. Just very kind. And on the putting green this morning he came up to me and he said how are you feeling? And I said nervous. And he goes, it's scorable. There's no wind. It's scorable. Just remember that. And it's a golf course at the end of the day and there's birdies to be had. There's no reason why you can't‑‑ he said go tear it up. And easier said than done. Yeah, I know there's birdies out there, but I can't feel my hands. There's a reason I can't feel my hands. 

Q. Are you staying in the Crow's Nest?
DOUG GHIM: I stayed on Monday night after the Amateur dinner. It's kind of crammed up there. But I had to do it at least once. Who knows, maybe if I have some inspiration I'll go in there Saturday night or something. But I'm staying here with my family in a private home a couple of miles from here. I wanted to spend this week with my family because it's as much as my mom and dad's week as it is mine. And it's been pretty special. 

Q. Did they drive and putt, your dad and mom?
DOUG GHIM: I was told that I could hit a shot. So I hit one. And I had my dad hit. And he was super nervous. I pulled a pitching wedge, he went with a nine. He gassed it. Thankfully no one got hurt. He looks at me and goes, hey, at least it's playable. And I had my mom putt out. And it was a special moment. My mom made the comment that it was the best day of her life. She had never been happier. The only thing that would have been better is if my sister could have made it. She couldn't have. But it's been such a crazy week. She's with me in spirit. 

Q. Low amateur, was that a big deal for you to win with the other amateurs here?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, of course. It would be a special honor. But I feel the main goal‑‑ there's too much golf to be played to make that the forefront of what I'm trying to do. I'm just trying to think about how I'm going to get in that first fairway tomorrow and how to put it in the middle of the green after that. And think if I could just limit the mistakes and handle my nerves I'll do all right.
