Q. 3-under 67 at Riviera first round of the U.S. Amateur.  That's a pretty good statement to stand by today, right?
DOUG GHIM: Yeah.  I mean, first day obviously trying to pace yourself for hopefully a long week, but all you're trying to do is put yourself in position as and as far away from the cut line as you possibly can.
It was definitely a good way to start.
Q. Now, I heard you played pretty darn good round at Bel-Air yesterday in practice.
DOUG GHIM: Yeah.
Q. Probably that was what led to you playing so well today.
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, it was almost -- it was kind of funny yesterday because I was playing really well.  Obviously it's a little bit easier during a practice round.  You know, it could sometimes be a good thing and sometimes a bad thing, right?  I feel like it raises your expectations.
I feel like I did the best that I could.  I was reminding myself that it was just a practice round, just a round.  If anything, it was just an eye opening to the opportunities that are out there and not to expect to make that many birdies.  I think we did a good job.
Also helped not to play the same exact golf course the next day and to have that expectation.  Tomorrow going back there we'll have good feels, but, again, not expecting anything like that.  It's going to be in a tournament, and it'll be a little bit harder to do that.
Yeah, there are birdies out there.
Q. As tested a competitor as you are, having a good round the first round is always great, because in the end everyone just wants to get to match play.  Do you feel a little bit more comfortable with the way you played at Bel-Air last time, and now you've got a good round under your belt going into that second round?
DOUG GHIM: For sure.  I mean, getting to match play, it's difficult, because there are 312 competitors and so many good players.  Every stroke really matters, so to start off with a 3-under today takes a load off.
It's kind of difficult to know or decide which course is easier.  Usually or often there is one course that kind of definitely feels a little bit more scorable.  I feel like both courses could bite you if you get it going the wrong way.
Just going to go out there with respect for the golf course and just try to play smart golf and see if we can play something at least a little similar to yesterday.
Q. What was your score had you kept score yesterday?
DOUG GHIM: 28, 33.  I wasn't even counting.  I just noticed I was making a ton of birdies.  The guys in my group were like, Well, that's another one.  Many pars have you made on this side?  I was standing on 9 green and had a six-footer for birdie and I was counting.  I was like, I made one par.  Any bogeys?  I was like, No.  Any Eagles?  No, I just made seven birdies and the par.  As like, Well, good luck.  (Laughter.)
I snuck it in there.  Someone mentioned to me like the course record I think is 61.  I don't know if you wanted to know that or not.  I'm like, Great.
Yeah, it was fun.  Played with some good friends so it was a lot of the fun.  They were actually cheering me on the whole way so it was fun.
