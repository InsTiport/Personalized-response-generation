 Q.  I'm down here with - I hate to even say runner up.  You played so well all week long.  I said a few moments ago sometimes we see such a great match and see two players in the arena play so well somebody shouldn't lose.  
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, just the way it goes sometimes.  What can I say?  Doc played so well coming down the stretch.   
Man, we weren't really giving each other anything all day.  We worked for everything.  There wasn't even?  That many holes won back and forth.  I felt like we halved so many hole.   
Unfortunately I just didn't come out on the winning end, but I have a lot to learn and a lot to cherish from this week.   
 Q.  You certainly played well:  2 birdies, 16 pars this afternoon.  There is not much you can do, is there, when you play against a guy who played and finished the way he did on 17 and 18?  
DOUG GHIM: Yeah, I mean, it's match play, right?  It was do or die for him and he did it.   
I mean, I'm still proud of what I did.  Like I said, just unfortunate didn't end the way I wanted it to.   
 Q.  You should be.  Congratulations on a great, great week.  See you in a couple weeks at the Walker Cup.  
DOUG GHIM: Thanks.
