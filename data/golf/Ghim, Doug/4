 Q.  You played at UT.  What is it like to come here to Dallas and get this opportunity?  
DOUG GHIM: It's incredible.  I got opportunity you to come out here for the Junior Byron Nelson Award when I was a senior in high school so to be back out here and playing actually in the tournament and to play as well as I did was a bonus and just happy to be here.   
 Q.  Kind of explain to people what it is like to really try to fight for a job out here on the PGA TOUR.  You currently play on the Web.com Tour.  Having a good finish this week can help propel you on to the next week.  
DOUG GHIM: I mean it's a lot of fun for me.  Obviously, I just started doing this.  It can be pretty stressful when you're doing it for a living, year-in, year-out.  All of a sudden it happens.  No, it's a lot of fun for me.  I mean this week was probably the best I've played in PGA TOUR event so far and came close at Torrey Pines and played well there.   
Got a lot of valuable experience this week and it is a little bit of added pressure knowing if I played well and finished better than I did today might have helped me tremendously.  You know, hopefully have a long career and look back at this experience.  The next time I get into this experience, I'll be more comfortable.
