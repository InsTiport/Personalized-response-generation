  Q. Great round today. Just tell me about it.   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT: Well, what was it, I was 6-under on the front, 3-under on the back. Just made a lot of birdies really.   
 Had a lot wedges in my hand out there, so I hit a lot of shots to about 10 feet; made some good putts; didn't make any mistakes.  
  
  Q. Does anything stand out? I know you said you had a lot of wedges in your hand. So driving, irons?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT: Yeah, just driving well. I played well. The scores are so good. The course is playing awesome. I thought, If I shoot 18-under today I might have a chance of winning.   
 But 9-under, that's great. Yeah, I'm really happy with the finish.  
  
  Q. The putt on 18 looked like you didn't really get it. Was 10 on your mind? Was any of that on your mind?  
 LINDSEY WRIGHT: I was a little nervous, to be honest, but it was a tough putt. I didn't want to shoot myself in the foot and be too aggressive. I probably lost a little bit of concentration by that point.   
 So, yeah, you know, who knows. I'm happy with the score.  
  
  Q. What now? It gets to 16 you'll stick around or kind of see what happens?  
 LINDSEY WRIGHT: I'll be around for an hour or so, but I doubt it. I think one of the leaders or someone who started the day at 14, 15 would finish, I would imagine 21, 22 would win.  
  
  Q. Cool. Well thanks.   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT: Thanks.
