   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  You're 6-under par, 66 today.  Birdie central out there.  What's going well for players?  Weather conditions?  Just everyone attacking the course?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, the conditions are awesome, pretty much.  It's not like last year.  It was difficult.  It's just playing shorter than last year so you're hitting a lot of wedge shots.  A lot of birdie chances.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Can we go over your scorecard?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, sure.  So we started on 10.  I had a bogey, and then par 11, 12, and 13.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  On your bogey on 10, what was your approach shot?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  It was a 5-iron.  No, a 6-iron.  I hit left into the bunker and chipped up and 2-putted.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  From how far?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  From about twenty feet.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  14.   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  And then 14th and 15 I made birdies.  On the Par 5, I reached that in two, and it was probably, on the top tee, probably about twenty feet.  Eagle.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  What club?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I used a 3-wood.  On 15, I hit good driver and I hit a 52-degree wedge, and I probably had twenty feet again.   
 16, parred 16.  And then I birdied 17 and 18.  17, I had about a four-foot birdie putt, 56-degree in, 456.   
 On 18, I hit a 6-iron to about 15 feet.   
 I parred 1 and 2, and birdied 3.  I hit a -- again, I think it was a 52-degree to about six feet.   
 Parred 4, 35.  I'm trying to remember that hole.  Oh, okay, the Par 5.  Yeah, what did I do there?  What club did I hit?  It was a 60-degree chip shot, and I hit it to about six feet.   
 Then on 6 I hit a 7-iron in to 15 feet for birdie.   
 7, I hit an 8-iron to about twenty feet above the hole.   
 Then on 8, I bogeyed 8.  I hit it left of the flag and chipped up to about 25 feet, 2-putt, a 7-iron.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Questions.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I found generally I tend -- this year I'm better at getting it to the hole.  Last year everything was short.  I think coming into this year I'm really determined to get to the hole, and I had a lot of good putts where the grain was working with me.  So I could just hit some nice putts.  Made a lot of good putts.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, it's a lot drier than what it was.  Yep, for sure.  It's playing great.  It's really good.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Not really, no.  I'm trying to work on -- I mean, it's like a classic golf cliche, one shot at a time, but that's one thing I really need to focus on.   
 So after that hole I was back to 2-under and I just though, every hole out here is a birdie opportunity and made some good putts.  Finished the front 9 pretty well.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I haven't had -- what did I have, 6-under?  I haven't had that in a while.  I've had a few 4 unders this year.  I can't remember.  Maybe Alabama last year.  McDonald's, in the last round I had 66.  I'm pretty sure.  I have a terrible memory.  I can't remember the golf holes.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I think it's just, first off, my wedge play has improved a ton, and around this course it's so important to have a good wedge game.  So that put me in good stead today.  It wasn't so good last year.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I feel really excited about -- my new equipment is just fantastic.  First time I've come into a season feeling like I'm prepared with equipment.   
 Usually every year it's like, you know, there's one thing that's not right, but it feels pretty good this year.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I spent a good two months at the end of last season working on my game.  Then I worked on fiddling with equipment, finding the right club.   
 I'm using Titleist now, so it's all come together.  It's been great the last few weeks.  Oh, and I had Lasik surgery.  I can see now.  I did, I had Lasik surgery in December, at the end of the last year, so that's been pretty wonderful, too.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, it's just golf, really.  I mean, I can sit here and say I made some great putts today, and I could hit them in the same spot tomorrow and not make one.   
 That was unfortunate the last round last week.  I think I finished 2-over for the day, but I played a great round.  So tomorrow just keep hitting the fairways.  That's the biggest key when you get under pressure.  You can just maybe start looking at the leaderboard, and that's really what I don't want to do tomorrow.   
 I want to stay in the moment.  With a course like this, I'm sure you're going to see a few more 6-unders.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I thought so.  It's good.  It's like first week back Danny and I working together.  So it's always the first week back always a little edgy, if you know what I mean.  But it was good.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Oh, yeah, I do.  I spoke to her yesterday.  She's excited.  She's obviously got the baby now.  I think she's got a website.  This new baby website phenomenon.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all very much.  Good luck tomorrow.   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Thank you.
