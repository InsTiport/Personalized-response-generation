  Q.  Lindsey, you certainly put yourself in position, you have to feel good about your rounds   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I haven't even had time to absorb it.  I've just come straight off the course.  It's awesome.  I'm so excited, I didn't look at the leaderboard all day.  I didn't know where I was until probably 15.  It's awesome.  I'm so excited   
  
  Q.  Do you think about that front nine, that it really set the tone with the four birdies on the front?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I was putting great and I took advantage of the front nine.  Not saying it's playing easy today but there's a lot of birdie opportunities.  I took advantage of it which is in my favor.   
  
  Q.  How nerve-wracking will the next hour or so be?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I was pretty nervous.  I've been choking the last nine holes of the tournament so I was a little nervous coming into the last nine.   
 But I held it together which I'm really happy with.   
  
  Q.  What will your routine be as you wait to see if the other players come back?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I'll probably just chat, sign autographs, and have a look and see how everyone is going.  But I haven't even seen the leaderboard.  I don't know what's going on right now.   
  
  Q.  It seems like you've played well here at McDonald's the last couple of years, is it the course?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I love the course.  Yeah, it's a great course.  I've stayed with the same people for three years now, so everything's great off the course.  I have a great time.  It's a great area.  I love it.
