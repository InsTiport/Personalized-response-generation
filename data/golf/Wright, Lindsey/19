  Q.  You had an awesome week, tough way to lose, can you talk about the whole experience of this week?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I had a great week.  Yeah, it wasn't the best match.  It was disappointing, I didn't feel like I gave her a run for her money.   
 But it's been a great week.  I've had some -- played some really good golf, which is positive going into the second half of the season, particularly the Evian next week and the British.  Playing with Annika was great, the highlight, and yeah, it's just terrific.  This event, I love match play.  Just walk away with so many positives.
