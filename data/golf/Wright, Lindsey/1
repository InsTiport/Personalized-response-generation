 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
KATHERINE KIRK:   We got to focus on winning four points tomorrow.   So it hurts, obviously, but we can't change what's happened, but we can learn from it and certainly go out there tomorrow and try and make amends.  
   
 Q.   Your partner Lindsey is not with you right now, she has an infection on her neck.   How is she doing with that?  
KATHERINE KIRK:   I think she's doing all right.   She's a trooper and a fighter.   So I'm sure she will be all right, and, yeah, we can hopefully come out tomorrow and fire on all cylinders.  
   
 Q.   Are you guys going to play together tomorrow then, sounds like you are?  
KATHERINE KIRK:   I'm not sure.   We haven't talked about it, actually.   We'll see what Karrie and Minjee want to do, and, I don't know, we might shake things up.  
   
 Q.   It seems like you're almost the unofficial captain of the team.   Does that make you Captain Kirk?  
KATHERINE KIRK:   Maybe.   
(Laughter.)   
   
 Q.   Lindsey, when do you feel like momentum really shifted in this match?  
LINDSEY WRIGHT:   We got put on the clock, I think, I don't know, 12?   And it just was, just, yeah, we got put on the clock.   We lost our timing and that was pretty much it.   
We played all right.   I didn't the last hole, but, yeah, it was really disappointing.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it came down to a matter of like putts?  
LINDSEY WRIGHT:   No, we just couldn't get our timing back.   We just lost our rhythm and timing.   It was just awful.
