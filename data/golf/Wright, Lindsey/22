 Q.  Lindsey Wright, big win for you, talk about what the turning point of the match was for you. 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  The turning point, I guess I was 4-up after nine holes and then I played two really bad holes and got to 2-up.  I just kind of got a bit slow out there.  So I just kept my head in the game and just focusing on playing my game rather than watching Brittany's game. 

 Q.  What were the two bad holes and what happened on them? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Probably No. 12 and No. 13. 

 Q.  What happened on those? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  The first one I made a bogey.  I missed the green way right.  And then the second on 13, I hit a shot in the fairway, it was in a divot and then I hit it fat out of the divot and then made bogey again and Brittany parred it. 

 Q.  So you were back to 2-up, and what did you do then? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I just made pars.  Brittany probably wasn't her best.  She hit a few wild shots and missed some fairways and had some tough shots in.  I just stayed -- I just kept it in the fairway really. 

 Q.  Have you played this event before? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, I played this third year in a row. 

 Q.  You've played three years in a row? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah. 

 Q.  What's your best finish? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Got to the second round last year and lost to Laura Diaz. 

 Q.  What are you doing particularly well, is it just a matter of doing well early? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, jump out early and you get confidence and if you're staying in the game -- out here you really want to get out early.  You want to be up early, simple as that.
