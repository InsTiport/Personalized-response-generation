  Q.  (Indiscernible.)   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  My goal was to finish fifth like I did.  To contend for a tournament was an awesome feeling.   
  
  Q.  What was it like being in the group and playing with Annika?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Oh, I loved it.  Annika is great.  I played with her last week actually.  It's great.  I learn so much from her.   
 I was walking down the last thinking, I don't know how she won 70 times, because I was nervous down the last few holes.   
  
  Q.  Were you nervous?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  No, not so much.  Kind of relaxed.  I'm just excited to finish higher up.  Usually I play the last round and kind of fall apart.   
  
  Q.  Are you doing anything in the off-season that is now paying off?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, everything.  All the work I've done in my game, and the equipment like we talked about yesterday.  The wedge play has improved a ton, short game.   
  
  Q.  What was your strongest point today?   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  I feel my putting has been a strong point, and around here you have to putt well.   
  
  Q.  What are you looking forward to maybe taking...   
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Actually winning.  I'll be happy if I'm standing here every week.
