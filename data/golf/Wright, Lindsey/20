 Q.  Another win, third round, just talk about how you played today? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Started off really slow.  The front nine wasn't very good.  I think it was just really early.  But I felt like I came alive after nine holes.  The front nine, J.J. had 2-up and I got my two back which was fortunate for me.  Just I played really well, just as good as yesterday, just putting well and making pars really.  I made a few birdies. 

 Q.  We talked yesterday about the mental side of it; is this where it starts to come into it now when you tee off again for the next 18? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Yeah, it starts all over again. 

 Q.  How are you feeling physically? 
 LINDSEY WRIGHT:  Not too bad.  Like I said, early in the mornings -- I felt good after nine holes.
