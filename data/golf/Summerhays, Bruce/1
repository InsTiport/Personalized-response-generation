  Q.  Thoughts on the round?   
 BRUCE SUMMERHAYS:  Very consistent today.  I putted -- well the front side was up-and-down.  Birdie bogey, birdie bogey, birdie bogey, and then one birdie and all pars on the back side.  So it's two different nines.  But the wind isn't near as fierce as it's been.  So have you a little bit better chance out there if you're hitting the ball pretty decent.  The and greens weren't quite as crusty.  When I played that first day, we started at 2:20 the greens got so crusty I 3-putted six times.   
 So the putting was much better today for me.  The last two days have been great.  But it was very, very consistent and it's fun to shoot under par around here again.   
  
  Q.  Other than just the weather, did you learn anything from the first two rounds that you kind of used today to get under par?   
 BRUCE SUMMERHAYS:  No, not really, except that I knew that I could.  From yesterday.  He putted really nicely yesterday and made some birdies yesterday.  So I knew it was out there.  I knew the greens would be a little bit more receptive this morning because they were yesterday, I could tell.   
 So they watered them nicely and didn't let it get away because of the wind.  And so I knew they would be receptive, so I could actually, I felt like I could fly it in there a little bit more.  And so as a result I did hit some close today.  I hit about four balls in there about three feet or closer.  So that was really fun.
