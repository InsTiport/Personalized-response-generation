Q.
How are the course conditions?
BRUCE SUMMERHAYS:  Great.  They're wonderful conditions.  The wind wasn't up today, so that it played a bit    well you would think it would play a little bit easier but the scores aren't really all that good for the lack of wind.  But the course conditions were perfect.
Q.  What was the advantage playing this morning?
BRUCE SUMMERHAYS:  You have smoother greens and I don't know, it doesn't get baked out as much    we actually got mud on our ball a number of times out there, hitting it in the fairway and things.  So they're putting the water to it.  But nonetheless, everything was really good.
