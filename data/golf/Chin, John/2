 Q.  Talk about today.  You had to be very pleased.  I know you wanted that eagle on the last hole, but all in all a good day, wasn't it?  
JOHN CHIN: Yeah, today was a really good putting day.  I don't know, just saw my lines really good; read the green out there pretty good.  Had a couple squirrely shots, but 66 first day, I'll take it.   
 Q.  Absolutely.  I thought the second shot at No. 9, the par-5, around those trees, was pretty good play.  
JOHN CHIN: Yeah, no, it was actually good missing the fairway out there.  Had a flier about 219; hit a 7-iron and just ended up perfect.   
 Q.  What have you learned so far now in I think your fifth start on the PGA TOUR?  What's the biggest thing you've learned up to this point?  
JOHN CHIN: Biggest thing is, I don't know, I mean, as cliche as it is, just playing one shot at a time.  I don't know how much I can stress that.  It's not about just shooting under par, even par, whatever.  You just go out there one shot at a time, add it up at the end, and see what happens.   
 Q.  So it's about patience.  
JOHN CHIN: Yes, exactly.   
 Q.  So you're learning as you go?  
JOHN CHIN: Yeah, even at 31 years old I'm still learning.
