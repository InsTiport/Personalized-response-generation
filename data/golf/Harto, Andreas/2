Q.   How do you like your position on the board after two days?
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   I'm obviously very happy.   Nice to be back up there after last week.   I played bad Saturday in Qatar but I'm still comfortable with my game.   I just feel good in general on the golf course.   I have my coach down for a couple of days, and tweaked around a few stuff but it was small stuff.   It seems to be working.

Q.   One of those things that you just need a little reminder?
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Yeah, definitely, it's all back to basics.   There was a little in my setup.   It's all those‑‑ when you are gone for a couple weeks, you get little things in your swing.   It's just small things that I have to change a little bit and seemed to work pretty well.

Q.   What worked today?   It's been trickier conditions for you and you've shot a nice score?
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   I got off to a nice start.   Was 4‑under on the front nine, made some good putts, big right‑to‑left putts and that was very nice to get off to that start. 
I struggled a little bit on the back nine, but I got up‑and‑down quite a few times from difficult angles.   You are not going to hit every green around this golf course and short game has to be good, too. 
On a day like this when it's tricky and the wind is swirling a little bit, you have to get up‑and‑down a couple of times and I managed to do that pretty well today.

Q.   Is this a tournament you've watched down the years and thought, one day? 
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Obviously.   I always thought the Middle East tournaments would suit my game pretty well.   The courses are pretty long and you have to drive the ball well, which I have managed to do.   I mean, apparently it seems to work that way, too. 

Q.   And you have lots of desert courses in Denmark?
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Yeah, all over the place.   Not many, but long courses suit my game and suit my eye and this is a pretty long and good test.   It's working out. 

Q.   I'll state the obvious, but you must be excited into the weekend and finding yourself in that position?
ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Yeah, I have a little bit to revenge from last week where I messed up on the Saturday but I'm looking forward to it.   It's just great being here.   As I said last week, too, I'm just enjoying myself and having fun out there and that's the most important thing.
