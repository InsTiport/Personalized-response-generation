 Q.   Tell us about two good days of golf because you've been knocking on that door all the time?  
    ANDREAS HARTÃ.   It's been two very, very good days.   I've played very solid.   I haven't made many mistakes, made a couple of bogeys both days, but I guess that's what you do around here on this course.   It's not the easiest of courses in the world.   I've played good, putted well, and managed to get myself where I am, that's good.   
   
 Q.   But a course that you like?   
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Yeah, definitely, it suits my game pretty well.   I hit it quite long and you need to do that around this course, and I managed to find a few fairways which has helped, too.   It's working out pretty well.  
   
 Q.   7‑under par is a lovely position on that board?  
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Definitely, it's nice to be where I am, definitely.   I mean, I'm just happy being on The European Tour again and playing these events is a lot of fun and managing to play well is just a bonus, it's great.  
   
 Q.   I imagine your expectations are high once you're in these positions?   
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Definitely you want to do well every week obviously but you've got to take it for what it is and I'm just enjoying myself and having fun with my caddie and the guys I'm playing well and that's the most important thing for me I guess.  
   
 Q.   Are you excited about 2013 to actually be out here and see all these venues and know that you can map out a whole season?  
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Definitely, it means a lot to me, just knowing that I can get into a lot of tournaments and plan my season better than I did two years ago.   It's great to have the type of category that I have I guess.   
   
 Q.   We saw you on European Tour Weekly, but a lovely apartment; you seem like you're nice and relaxed and just would enjoy the camaraderie and the whole atmosphere about things?  
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   That is my biggest goal in this game.   It sounds vague, but I mean, it is a big goal for me just to have fun.   It's still not a job for me.   I'm just trying to enjoy myself and have fun on the golf course and if the cameraman came to my apartment, I had fun with them there, too.   I'm enjoying life and I'm enjoying being where I am.  
   
 Q.   So what gets you down, presumably like anybody out there, if you hit a bad shot you get angry for a moment?  
    ANDREAS HARTÃ:   Definitely, you get down on yourself a little bit but you've got to drag yourself out of the hole you're digging yourself into.   I'm getting better and better at that I guess.   I'm getting more and more mature I guess.
