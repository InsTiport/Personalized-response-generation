  Q. So the back nine is your best friend this week; I think you've won holes 9 and 14 in every match.  What do you like about the back nine?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   9 and 14, yeah.  So I've been down in all of my matches, but 9 has been a big turning point actually for me.  I know that if I can get there and then be 1-down or even going on to the back nine, then I feel like the last couple holes I feel like I have an advantage.  Yeah, it was a good match.
 Q. What was the pace of this match and the one this morning?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   The one this morning was crazy.  I was 2-down.  I knew that she was a great player.  She won the Junior last year, and it was a great match.  Even coming down the stretch she was making shots and kind of reminded me of like an Andrea Lee match last year.
 She holed a putt on 17 to keep going.  I thought she was going to hole it.  She had been playing well all day, and then the match this afternoon was kind of the same thing, I was down and then the last couple holes I got it back.  Really proud and happy about the way I played.
 Q. Being the defending champion there's a lot of pressure.  You're a quarterfinalist again.  What is your confidence level?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   It's awesome.  Obviously I've done this before, and I don't really feel the pressure or expectation or anything.  It's mostly coming from myself, to be honest.  But I'm just trying to have as much fun as I can out here, and I am doing that, so it's been awesome.
