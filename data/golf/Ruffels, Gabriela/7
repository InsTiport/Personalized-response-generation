Q. Playing in your first AIG Women's Open here at Royal Troon, can you reflect on your experience during the week?
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   It was awesome, first British Open and first time in Europe.  First time playing golf in Europe, and the conditions this week were not easy.  So I mean, I was paired with some really awesome players, Angela Stanford and Catriona Matthews.  So it was awesome to learn from them, too, and draw from their experience.  Such a fun week.
Q. Catriona Matthew, obviously a legend of the game, but particularly here in Scotland and she had a fantastic round yesterday.  What was it like playing with someone of her calibre and experience?
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   It was awesome.  I was just trying to pick up as much information, I guess and learn from her as I could, and her short game is absolutely amazing and the way she recovers after bad shots, and even her mental game, she stays super steady and patient out here, and you can tell why she's done really well and especially really well in Europe.
Q. How did you find it out there?  Obviously conditions were just so tough.
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   I thought I played pretty good, a lot better than what the score was.  As I said before, first time in Europe and these conditions were not easy.  I don't think I have ever played in these kind of conditions before.
So the first day wasn't great, but it took some kind of getting used to the shots that I had to hit and everything, but happy with the way I could bounce back today.
Q. Now do you feel like having played in a major now, you've learned anything that you can take forward with you as you look to obviously a long career?
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   For sure.  I think I can just draw a lot of confidence from this.  I played the U.S. Open last year.  That was my first major and I wasn't kind of near the cut.  I think I was kind of intimidated by the players and seeing everyone that I kind of watch on TV but I think that I'm closer than what I think and I think that's something I can learn and draw from this week for sure.
