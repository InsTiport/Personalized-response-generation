Q. Seems like your irons were really on fire, especially on the back nine.  Talk me through how you're feeling.
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   Yeah, definitely on the back nine everything kind of got a little bit better.  It was a little bit of a shaky start.  She was 1-up -- yeah, she was 1-up pretty early.  I think maybe like the third hole or something, but it took me to while to kind of get into it, but was really happy with the way I finished.
Q. After having played the course a few times the last couple days, did you make any adjustments out there today?
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   Yeah, so I played a little later today.  I played at 2:30, so the wind was up.  The wind was up a lot more and kind of a different direction than the other couple days, so I did have to make a couple adjustments with what I hit off of tees, but other than that it was the same game plan.
Q. Does it feel different coming back to defend the title given everything that's going on or when you're out there does it just feel like a regular golf tournament?
GABRIELA RUFFELS:   I mean, I'm trying to make it feel like a regular golf tournament, but obviously there's a little bit more pressure and expectation, but that's what I thought it would be coming into it.  Honestly it's just a bunch of fun.  I'm just having fun out there, and whatever happens happens.
