  Q. Gabriela, great playing today.  As expected, Cypress played tougher than Jackrabbit.  What are your thoughts on your opening round today?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   Yeah, was really happy with it.  I was just excited to get it going and can't believe the first round is already done.
 Yeah, I was 1-over on the back nine, which is my front nine, so happy with the way I could bring it home.
 Q. Even round through round one; 18 holes in today.  As an amateur playing in this championship, what does it mean to be this high up on the leaderboard through the first round?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   Yeah, it's really cool.  I mean, I'm not really a leaderboard watcher, but just trying to go out there, see how good I can do, and definitely happy with the round.
 Q. This championship has a ton of history.  Do you believe that this is a tournament that an amateur can win?
 GABRIELA RUFFELS:   Yeah, for sure.  I think one has won one one time, right, in the history?  It can be done obviously, so it's still early days.
 Just keep going.
