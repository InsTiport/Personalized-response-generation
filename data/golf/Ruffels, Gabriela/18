Q. How did it feel out there today?
GABRIELA RUFFELS: Yeah, it felt great.  I started off with a birdie, and I was 2-under through 9, made a good par save on 18, and just kind of kept it rolling from there.
Q. What have you learned these last two days about this course here at Old Waverley?
GABRIELA RUFFELS: I mean, you've just got to hit your spots.  I don't think it's too long.  I was talking to my coach, I think you've just got to stay patient, pick your holes that you want to be aggressive on but then kind of lay off on the harder holes.  Yeah, I feel like I did a pretty good job of that.
Q. Obviously things kind of start over again tomorrow.  What's your experience like in match play?
GABRIELA RUFFELS: I mean, I love match play.  I just won the North and South a couple weeks ago, and I really enjoy match play, especially coming from a tennis background, kind of that one-on-one.  I do enjoy match play, so we'll see how it goes.
Q. You have kind of an athletic family.  What have you learned from your parents and brother and all that?
GABRIELA RUFFELS: Yeah, it's kind of neat coming from a family where my parents were professional tennis players and my brother is a professional golfer.  I definitely get advice from them on how to compete and how to stay calm under pressure, and I think it helps definitely getting some advice from them.
Q. What's the game plan kind of for the rest of today and then how does the heat play a factor the rest of the week?
GABRIELA RUFFELS: Yeah, so I'm just going to maybe practice a little, hit some out on the range and then just go back and rest.  Yeah, I just came from North Carolina a couple weeks ago, so I'm kind of used to the heat, but yeah, the heat is fine, it's the same for everyone, so just got to put up with it.  But yeah, looking forward to it.
