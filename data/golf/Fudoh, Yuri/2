   COLIN CALLANDER: Ladies and gentlemen, we have your-feud oh with us, 68 for a two-round total of 134, 10-under par and that ties the championship record which was set in 1997 by Emilee Klein and equalled by Jeong Jang in 2005.
 Could we ask for your reaction to today's round and the conditions? 
 YURI FUDOH: It's a little bit windy today but I could make good shots today and I had a good round today. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: Pete Coleman is caddying for you this week. Is this the first time he's been on the bag, and if so, how did it all happen? 
 YURI FUDOH: Yes.
 COLIN CALLANDER: And how did you two meet? 
 YURI FUDOH: Through a friend three years ago. 

 Q. You had good short putts today. 
 YURI FUDOH: Yes, but I missed a few today but I got much better than last year or the year before. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: Could you tell us about your birdies, the birdie on the 8th hole? 
 YURI FUDOH: 9, eight-foot putt, sand wedge. 
 Eagle at 10. Driver, 7-wood.
 16 -- the tee shot was in the right side of the rough and second shot was edge of the green. 
 The distance of the second shot on the 10th hole, 115 yards.

 Q. What do you think of your name being on top of the leaderboard?
 YURI FUDOH: It's only two days, so it doesn't feel like anything. 
 I always think about going forward. 

 Q. What will you do tomorrow? 
 YURI FUDOH: It all depends on the weather and at least I want to keep the same position. 

 Q. How is the golf course playing? Many Japanese players had a good result today; does this course suit the Japanese players? 
 YURI FUDOH: The course looks a little bit like some Japanese courses, but it is the result of everyone's efforts. 

 Q. What do you think about competing with Ai Miyazato in this event? 
 YURI FUDOH: I don't feel like competing with those players but I just think I'm doing my best in each hole. 

 Q. There is only one other Japanese player to have won a major event, and do you have competition with how to win majors? 
 YURI FUDOH: I've never talked about that with her but sometimes I get advice from her when I don't feel good. 

 Q. In the past you've had lots of experience playing majors and including the U.S. Open, and right now you seem to be quite comfortable. What do you think about winning a major championship?
 YURI FUDOH: You know, the remaining two days is still a long ways, and I'm just thinking about doing my best on each hole. You.
 COLIN CALLANDER: Thank you very much, indeed and best of luck this weekend.
