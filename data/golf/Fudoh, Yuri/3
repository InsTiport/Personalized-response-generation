  Q. Can you talk about your round?  
 YURI FUDOH: I started really well on the first tee and I made it to the green on two and made a really good birdie putt and that got me going.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the tournament in general and how you're playing and your position?   
 YURI FUDOH: It's a very important tournament for all players, it's a major. But for a Japanese players, you only get a few chances to play in these kind of big tournaments, so you really want to take advantage and it's a great privilege to play.   
  
  Q. How was the course today?   
 YURI FUDOH: Compared to the last few times I've played in Ireland, these kind of courses, the greens feel a lot softer, but still, you need to hit consistent shots.
