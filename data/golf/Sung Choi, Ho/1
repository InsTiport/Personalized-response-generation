 Q.  Can we get some comments about your second round?  
HO SUNG CHOI: To be honest, I didnât play very comfortably today. I had big expectations for myself to play well, and was tossing and turning last night due to it. I was off to a decent start on the first hole, making a difficult up-and-down, so I thought things were going to go my way. But, I feel like I lacked with my short game. The grass is a lot thicker than what Iâm used to in Asia and I noticed it held onto my club a lot. I think it takes time to get adjusted to something like that. I also three putted three times, which Iâm not happy about. Iâm going to practice hard to work on those areas.   
 Q.  Youâll be making your next PGA TOUR start at the Barracuda Championship. How will you prepare for that event?  
HO SUNG CHOI: With every region of the United States being so different, Iâll honestly have a better idea when I get there. Iâm excited for the challenge.   
 Q.  A lot of fans came out to see you today. Do you have a message for them?  
HO SUNG CHOI: Iâm so grateful. Of course, I wouldâve loved to have made the cut and compete on the weekend. Iâm quite sad that I wonât be able to do that. I just want to thank everyone. Iâve tried my best, but nobodyâs perfect. Iâll work hard to come back stronger.
