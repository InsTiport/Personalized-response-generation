 MATT GOGEL:  You know, it was a tough match.  Nobody was ever up more than one.  On the front side, I felt like I was playing pretty well and he was hanging in there.  Then the back nine, he kind of had the momentum and I got it out and made a couple of birdies in overtime; and I didn't expect to miss that putt, I made every putt today. 

Q.  Similar thing happened with Els and Lehman.  Seems like when you get into these extra holes, maybe there is just a lapse on the short putt?
MATT GOGEL:   You're tired, and you're probably not thinking as well.  But also, there's a little tension involved because you know there's no extra holes after this.  So, you know, happy to be moving on. 

Q.  Do you feel good about the progress that you've made? 
MATT GOGEL:   Yeah, I really felt pretty good coming into today after a very tough match.  I felt like I should have been 3- or 4-UP, but he was making some putts and some chip-ins.  So it was quite a battle. 

Q.  Last thing, you've got Tom Lehman next. 
MATT GOGEL:   He's obviously a brilliant player, and I'm going to have to play my best to beat him. 
Anything can happen.  We saw that after the first day with the Top  3 seeds going out.  If I putt well and hit some good shots, hopefully I'll have a chance to beat him.
