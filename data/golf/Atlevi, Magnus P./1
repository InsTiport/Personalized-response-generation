 Q.  Thoughts on that 65?  
MAGNUS P. ATLEVI: I'm very pleased.  The weather naturally is much more better, more playable, but it's still a good score.   
 Q.  What was the highlight of your round, or highlights, I should say?  
MAGNUS P. ATLEVI: Highlight, I thought I was playing well all the way around, which was nice.  I haven't done that.  I haven't put all the pieces together lately but today I have.  So it was very nice.   
 Q.  Did you feel a score was out there standing on the first tee?  
MAGNUS P. ATLEVI: I did.  I felt like if the leaders -- I think they are 3-under par, so I felt like I got to 3-under quite quickly, and I felt like after that, I needed to gain some shots on the field.  I think most players, play solid today, shoot 3-under, 4-under maybe.  Hopefully I gain a few shots by 6-under.   
 Q.  I think you're within five of the lead perhaps.  Chances going into tomorrow?  
MAGNUS P. ATLEVI: I'm still way behind.  Well not way behind but there's so many good players in front.  And today, you see JimÃ©nez, he's 7-under par at the moment.  I just need to do what I did today and we'll see what it ends up with.   
 Q.  Do you take anything from your performance in this championship last year?  
MAGNUS P. ATLEVI: I do.  I just realized, I felt like my performance was much better than I realised last year.  Now coming in here and starting off badly, I felt like, God, I did well last year.  But I felt -- you get good memories.  I think I used it and finally I got it together today.  So I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
