Q.  Mr. Jacobsen, can you tell us a little bit about your round today?  You finished even par?
PETER JACOBSEN:  Yeah, I started off with a triple bogey and that got me right off the bat.  I played bad.  I played bad the weekend.  That triple on one today, I was just behind the eight ball all day.
Q.  Did you feel like you rebounded after that?
PETER JACOBSEN:  Yeah, I had a triple on the first hole and I came back pretty well.  I played the, I made the turn at 2 over, and then I bogeyed 11 and 12, which put me, again, I just was out it have from there.

I played okay.  I just didn't make any putts all week.  I just wasn't making, just didn't make a lot of putts.  And the weekend I just really struggled with all aspects of my game.
Q.  Tell us about playing with Jay Haas who had a chance to win this?
PETER JACOBSEN:  He played great.  He started off with a bogey on 2, and 3, and then birdied 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  So that really jump started his round.
Q.  Did that help you kind of rebound a little bit, having somebody play that well?
PETER JACOBSEN:  It always helps when you play with somebody who starts really going low, it kind of pulls you along.
