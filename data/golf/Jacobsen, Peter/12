Q.   Talk about today's round in general. 
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yeah, it's a challenging golf course.   You've got to drive the ball straight.   You got to put it in play to be able to have a chance to get the ball on the proper level on the greens. 
If you miss a fairway like I did on a couple holes, you are really scrambling. 
But the greens are smooth, I think they're the proper speed, yeah, it's a real challenge.

Q.   Had the course played much differently between the last several rounds you played here?
PETER JACOBSEN:   The wind switched today.   The wind was an opposite wind than we saw in the practice rounds.   So that made it a little bit more of a challenge too.
