Q.   With Peter Jacobsen.   Pretty consistent round of golf today; three birdies, one bogey.   Could you take me through some of it?
PETER JACOBSEN:   My only bogey was No.4.   I three‑putted from about 20 feet.   I got a little aggressive and knocked it about three feet by and missed it.   Overall, I was very, very consistent, drove it good.
Of course, it helped playing with Fred because Fred and I are‑‑ we played a lot of golf together, and we go back to the days in the northwest.   Felt almost like it was a practice round out there.   It was a lot of fun.
He played great, and it kind of spurred me on.   So I felt good about it.

Q.   Can you talk about the condition of the golf course, how it's different than the last couple of days?
PETER JACOBSEN:   I just‑‑ I can't tell you how impressed I was when I got here on Tuesday and saw the course, and it's gotten better every day.   I think the golf course is playing fair.   The greens have a lot of slope, but the speeds aren't out of control.
Not only is this fair, this is fun.   This is a fun golf course to play.

Q.   Did you ask him about seeing 65 the other day too?
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yeah, seeing a lot of good scores out there.

Q.   You played with Kite in the first few rounds.
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yes.

Q.   So you saw a record on the front.
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yesterday he got it to 9.   He could have really gone.

Q.   What are you telling him?   What kind of advice are you passing along?
PETER JACOBSEN:   I'm saying nice to meet you on the 1st tee, and I'm not saying a word now.   Just kidding.   These guys, we've all played together for 30 years.   We all know each other.   So it's pretty comfortable.   It's pretty comfortable.

Q.   And you had a good round of golf.
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yeah, I played well.   I shot 2 under.   It's not too bad.
