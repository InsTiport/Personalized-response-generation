 Q. How's your knee?
 PETER JACOBSEN: It's fine. It's two months post-op now and I'm up walking around, actually playing a little golf now. 

 Q. Rehab is different now than 20, 25 years ago. They get you right into it, right?
 PETER JACOBSEN: Yeah, I was rehabbing three days after the surgery. I was walking the day of. And I got some great therapists that are putting me through all the exercises and that. I'm doing really well. I'm better for it.

 Q. What's your timetable now for getting back out and swinging?
 PETER JACOBSEN: Oh, out here, playing tournaments? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 PETER JACOBSEN: Well, I'm playing now. I played nine holes a couple times. But maybe a month, maybe five weeks, six weeks, I want to make sure that I'm ready to play when I come out.

 Q. Well, we miss having you out here. Do you miss the rough that's out here?
 PETER JACOBSEN: Well, I played a bunch, I played '89 here, I played the '95 Ryder Cup, I played the 2004 PGA. So is I'm real familiar. 
 And I really was looking forward to the course, but at the end of the week my daughter is marrying a young man from Rochester on Saturday, so we are here with the family. And I expected to be playing. But we're just having fun anyway. 

 Q. Well great. Thank you. 
 PETER JACOBSEN: Thank you.
