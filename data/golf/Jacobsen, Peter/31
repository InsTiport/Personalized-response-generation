Q.  How do you feel about today's round?
PETER JACOBSEN:  I only played 11 holes.  I'm 1 under for the day.  I played okay.  We got very unlucky with the weather.
Q.  What is your strategy for tomorrow?
PETER JACOBSEN:  To make as many birdies as I possibly can.  That's the strategy.
Q.  Are you going to do anything different?
PETER JACOBSEN:  Do anything different?  Hit it close to the hole and knock them in.
