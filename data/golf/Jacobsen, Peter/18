MARK ROLFING:  Pete, you told me before the round that your hip was hurting more than it has in two years.  How did you manage to make your way around the course?

PETER JACOBSEN:  I just gutted it out.  This is a U.S. Senior Open.  I wanted to start    normally when it hurts in the morning, if I can get playing and walk it off and kind of get through the first five or six holes it will loosen up.

That's what it did today.  Although my warm up, I wouldn't even call it a warm up.  It wasn't really anything that I was excited about.  I wasn't excited about playing, but it's a very important tournament.  I wanted to play.

MARK ROLFING:  It looks like you may be as many as four shots behind.  Can you still win?

PETER JACOBSEN:  Well, with Tom Watson leading, this has the feel of a British Open.  Because Prairie Dunes feels like you're in Scotland or Ireland.  Four shots with Tom Watson is very difficult, but we're going to give it a try.
