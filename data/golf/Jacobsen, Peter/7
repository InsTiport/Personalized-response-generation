 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PETER JACOBSEN:   Hard to say.   I don't think having soft greens here ‑‑ I mean, it helps, but the greens are ‑‑ the putting surfaces, the green complexes are so big that you have to put the ball on the right quadrant.   
You just‑‑ put it this way:   Having a 40‑footer here is not like a 40‑footer at any other golf course.   Because a 40‑footer here is going to have probably 10 or 12 feet of break, up a hill, down a hill, left, breaking left, breaking right.   
So it's hard to say.   It's hard to say.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess how you played today?  
PETER JACOBSEN:   I played good today.   I played really good.   
I was going along nicely birdied 12 and 13 and then I ran into some trouble at 15.   I hit a beautiful second shot that just came up short into the bunker and did the same thing at 16, I hit a shot just short of the green, into the bunker.   
And getting the ball up‑and‑down out of these deep bunkers is very difficult.   That's one of the things they did when they changed the greens, they elevated all the greens probably three, four, five feet.   Keeping the depths of the bunkers the same.   
So it's tough for me.   I don't know how these members get the ball up‑and‑down out of the bunker, but it's tough for me.
