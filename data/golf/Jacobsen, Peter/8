Q.   Talk about your round.   It looks like you'll be on the cut.   It looks like you'll make it.
PETER JACOBSEN:   I don't know what the cut's going to be, but I sure played well.   Both days.   I had a 75 yesterday, 69 today.   I played good, the golf course is hard, it's long, the golf course is playing very long. 
So you got to put the ball on the green, near the hole.   I didn't do that very well yesterday.   I did that well today. 

Q.   Was there, what was the big difference between yesterday and today?   Weather?
PETER JACOBSEN:   Well, the weather was terrible yesterday.   It was blowing and spitting rain.   But as I said, these greens, Rees Jones has changed these greens to where there's three distinct quadrants on just about every green.   And if you don't get the ball on the right quadrant, you're going to have some really difficult 2‑putts.   And I ended up 3‑putting I think two or three times yesterday.   So that really hurt me.   But I didn't have that today.   I had the ball in the right quadrant.

Q.   Any flashbacks to 2004 here?
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yeah, it's always great to come back to where you've had success.   It's, it looks the same from the tee to the green but the greens are really different.   The greens have, he's really changed the greens so much.   He's elevated the greens, they're higher, there's no bump and run, there used to be a few holes where you could bump the ball in, but now you got to, everything's in the air.   You've got to hit the ball into the greens up in the air.   You've got to, it's golf in the air.
