.  What do you think about this venue for the Senior PGA Championship?
PETER JACOBSEN:  I think it's awesome.  I love the course, it's always been one of my favorite courses, it's a great test of golf.
Q.  Do you think the weather is going to play a factor as far as how players approach the course this week?
PETER JACOBSEN:  If the weather is wet and cold it's going to always cause problems on any golf course.  It plays long and with a lot of uphill holes.  So, yeah, it will be a factor.
Q.  What do you think the final score will be for the winner?
PETER JACOBSEN:  Well, I have no idea.  If I said the lowest score, that would be the winner.
