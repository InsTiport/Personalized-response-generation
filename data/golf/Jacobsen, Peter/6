Q.   Talk about your day a little.   I know you finished 1‑over. 
PETER JACOBSEN:   I didn't play very well today.   I played good all week, but today I was just off a bit.   I scrambled real well.   Middle of the round I had some good up‑and‑downs.   I hit some good shots, but overall disappointed 1‑over. 

Q.   You made a ton of pars.   Nothing you could get going?
PETER JACOBSEN:   Yeah, every time I hit a green I had it 15, 20 feet for ‑‑ and I missed it.   And then the other ones I got it up‑and‑down for par. 
So it was just one of those blah days.

Q.   Obviously you probably have fond memories of Bellerive from 2004.   What will you remember from this week?
PETER JACOBSEN:   Well, I'll remember what a great job the club did for all of us, tremendous club here at Bellerive.   The clubhouse service was great, the golf course was in immaculate condition.   Congratulations to, I think it's John Cunningham and his staff here at Bellerive. 
But it's just great.   Great being back in St. Louis and great being back at Bellerive.
