   RHONDA GLENN: First of all, you were probably the decided underdog today, Terri. You had not played in a National Finals before? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: That's correct, yeah.
 RHONDA GLENN: How did you get yourself up for this match? How did you approach it? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: To try to stay as calm as I possibly can and one shot at a time. I'm certainly not a long ball hitter like she is. But as I stated earlier, it's not the drive, it's how you arrive, and that's golf.
 RHONDA GLENN: 11 and 13, she had trouble with her drive. She felt that's where she lost her momentum. How did you approach those holes? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Just played the holes like I played all week. Just stay in the middle and get it on the green in regulation and two-putt. If I'm fortunate to birdie, I do.

 Q. When did you feel like maybe you could say to yourself, okay, this is mine? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I never did. Never did. It's not over until the last putt is in.

 Q. When that last putt went into the hole, what did you think when you knew you had won? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Pretty incredible. Probably the luckiest person today on this golf course. 

 Q. Explain that luck. Why do you feel so fortunate? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Golf is a game of bounces. Some go your way and some don't. Statistically, the better shot you hit, they're going to be in your favor. But it's the old saying, run of the green. But like the gal said at the introduction, any one of a lot of people could have won this golf tournament. 
 So whether it's the draw, who you're playing, how they're playing that day, how I'm playing that day, it's golf.

 Q. She had her husband here rooting for her. Who did you have here when you first arrived even supporting you, and who is now supporting you? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I certainly had a great draw with my caddie, Bob. Very calm individual, kept me calm. I'm a little bit of an energetic individual, so he kept me in the moment. I tried to take my time to develop that patience and that rhythm. 
 I met some great volunteers here who befriended me and took me to dinner a couple of times. 
 Interestingly, one gentleman, a friend of Bob's, his company and his wife's company have a scratch and sniff company. They make the fragrances. And on the second day he made a fragrance for me, lavender and French vanilla, and he called it Victory. And I have a little patch that says Victory, and I haven't yet scratched and sniffed it yet.

 Q. It must smell pretty good. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: It smells damn good.

 Q. I think we should market that for you. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yes, I think he is. I think he is. They were wonderful people. They all came out and watched every day.

 Q. What was his name, do you remember? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Tim and Melissa. I don't know Tim's last name.
 RHONDA GLENN: Are they members here? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No, no, huh-uh. Just friends of Bob's. That's really special to have people like that come out.

 Q. Can you talk about -- you're two down early on. You battle back and get it squared after six. Can you talk about your thought process after you got down? It's a long match at that point still. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, it's still long. I got a workout on number four hitting the ball a few times, but it's match play. And it doesn't bother me if I lose it and miss a short putt or something like that. That's a little -- but you have to put it behind you, and I was able to do that. Again, there is a game on each hole.

 Q. Can you talk about the putt on 8? I thought that was a big momentum lifter. She squared it, but still, she wasn't expecting that. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No, no. Yeah, I birdied that hole a couple of times.

 Q. About 25 feet?
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I don't think it was that far. I think it was probably about 18.

 Q. 18? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah. My caddie and I read it, and we agreed on a couple of holes-and-a-half out. And I've been trying to let the ball fall in the hole because you can be too aggressive and take it by (the hole) four or five feet, and that's what I didn't want to do today. You know, it fell in the hole. 
 RHONDA GLENN: We'll go over your card a little bit. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Bear with me if I have to think a little bit, because I am over 50.
 RHONDA GLENN: Okay. You just talked about the birdie on 8. That's very good. Then you won three holes. Number 11, you were in that collection area? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yep, hit a great sand wedge out of the collection area to about 12 feet, and she left her chip shot short and I took the hole. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Then 12, you won it with a bogey. No, I'm sorry, that's 13. 12 you won with birdie.
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, I hit it within three and a half feet and was able to make the putt. She was about 18, 20 feet.

 Q. What did you hit in? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Pitching wedge about 108 yards, just a choked-down wedge.

 Q. Is it an advantage when your opponent is a little longer off the tee, and you hit first and you knock it in there? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: It can be an advantage. I guess I'd have to ask them. Yeah, yeah.

 Q. Yeah. But definitely, obviously, if you hit it tight. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Oh, sure. But she had a --

 Q. She hit a good shot. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, she did. And she hit one tight on two, a great shot within about three feet. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Then on 13, that's the hole you won with the bogey. Just kind of replay that one for us? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, she had a unplayable -- I guess she did. I'm not sure what it was. She had to take a lift and place, unplayable.

 Q. She was in the hazard.
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Okay, I didn't see it. So, yeah, I kind of pulled my second shot. I'm a little weary of going over that other gathering area on that hole, and I pulled it, and didn't make a good chip down the hill from where my approach landed. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Did you know how you won the hole though? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yes, after she didn't have a good putt off the green.

 Q. So that little tree wasn't really bothering you on your approach? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No, it was just a yank. I just pulled it.

 Q. Were you inspired by wearing yellow and just a little bit of black? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No, this is my favorite shirt because it hangs well. It does. It's bright, and I just like it. 
 RHONDA GLENN: You wore your favorite? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I wore my favorite shirt, yeah.

 Q. Any other superstitions you had today? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: That's not a superstition, Dave.

 Q. Fashion choice. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I never, never tuck my shirts in, ever, because they don't stay in.

 Q. Yeah, why bother. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No, they don't stay in. I certainly like to look nice on the golf course, but...
 RHONDA GLENN: What other National Championships have you played, if any? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Laura Carson reminded me. Laura and I went to school at Rollins together, and I hadn't seen her in 30 years except for this tournament. It was a wonderful reunion. We played I think our senior year we played in the -- I think it was (Inaudible).
 RHONDA GLENN: So the National Women's Collegiate Championship? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Correct. And I played in the National Juniors when I was 15. And I lost to Betsy King on the 18th hole. I think she was my first match. (It was her second match.)
 RHONDA GLENN: (Inaudible). That was her name at the time, Mary Beth.
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Oh, it was. Okay, okay.
 RHONDA GLENN: First round you say? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: I think it was. It was such a long time ago.
 RHONDA GLENN: Do you remember what year it was? What year were you born? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: '56, so I was probably about 15. 
 RHONDA GLENN: '71? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, '71, '72. 
 RHONDA GLENN: And the National Collegiate. When did you graduate? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: '78.

 Q. That was your senior year? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yes, I believe so, uh-huh.

 Q. And you haven't played in any other USGA tournaments? 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: No.
 RHONDA GLENN: Except for that U.S. Girls' Junior.

 Q. Wow. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Yeah, yeah.

 Q. Time is a charm, huh? 
 RHONDA GLENN: Tell them a little bit why you decided to play. 
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Well, I graduated from college, and I didn't want to turn pro. You have to be very good, and I wasn't in that category. I needed to make a living, so I actually put the clubs down and picked them up again in 2003 or 2004, just played. 
 Just the last four or five years playing a little bit more, getting a little bit more competitive. My mom passed in 2007, and she always, always encouraged me to play. So I thought well, you know, okay. Life's really short, and I love being outdoors. It doesn't get any better than being on a golf course. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Congratulations. This is really something.
 TERRI FROHNMAYER: Thank you. It is something.
