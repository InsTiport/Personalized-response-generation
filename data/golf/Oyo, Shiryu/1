 Q.  Just talk a little bit about what was working out there for you.  
SHIRYU OYO: My coach and I just kind of -- we focused on one thing this week, and that was just positioning, never putting yourself on the wrong side of the hole.  And even if you miss the greens, giving yourself easy chips, and I think we did a good job of that.   
 Q.  What has this experience been like the first two days playing in your first U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst and being near the top of the leaderboard?  
SHIRYU OYO: It's quite humbling.  I was honestly just trying to make match play and obviously trying to win from there, but I feel like I seem to thrive off tournaments where the scores aren't too low, because I always seem to shoot somewhere around low 60s to -- no, high 60s to low 70s, so I kind of took that to my advantage.   
 Q.  Anything you're going to tweak for tomorrow, and what's your mindset going into match play?  
SHIRYU OYO: I think we're going to go with the same game plan as we did yesterday on No. 2, as well.  I made a lot of pars.  I feel like on a golf course like No. 2, especially in match play, I think it's going to do me pretty good.
