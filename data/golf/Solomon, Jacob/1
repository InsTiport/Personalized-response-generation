Q. What did you think of it out there today?
JACOB SOLOMON: Pretty tough.  No. 2 is a really good test, and even though I played well, still ended up 1-over.  Just the pins and the firmness of the greens are really tricky.  But I think 1-over is a really solid round out there, and definitely pleased and looking forward to match play.
Q. What are your thoughts?  You're obviously in a really good spot for match play.  What are your thoughts heading into tomorrow?  Obviously there's a lot of golf out there, but looking pretty good.
JACOB SOLOMON: Little different approach with match play, I think, just playing your opponent a little more and kind of playing off what he does.  But still, at the end of the day, if you make birdies and pars on this golf course, you'll probably win.  Just going to go with that mindset, see where we're playing in the morning, and I'm looking forward to it.
