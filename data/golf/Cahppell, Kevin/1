 Q.  Tough start to the round, but then you finished with a bang.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, you know, Plantation course is in great shape, but the backside was tough there early.  There were some pucker holes, 10 through 13.  And then you can kind of get it.  Obviously got me early.  I played really well there the last 12 holes, last 13 holes.   
Real happy with that.   
 Q.  Early there was no wind whatsoever, and then it picked up out on the Sea Side course.  Was it swirl around the trees on the Plantation course?  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: As we made the turn it got swirling pretty good.  I drove it well today.  I was in position and was able to take advantage of the soft golf course.   
 Q.  And thoughts tomorrow going to Sea Side?  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Just really enjoying what we're doing.  Last week of the year.  Kind of have embraced the island life.  Having two courses here brings back the feel of Disney again.  It was real lax, but there was a tournament going on.   
You know, maybe I can learn from something in my game.  Just the more relaxed I am the better I play.
