YVONNE CHOE:  Actually, I started up, you know, started out the lead going one up in the 1st hole.  But then I figured, you know, anything can happen.  Then I really didn't think I was going to win until like the 16th hole because she had this like long putt for a par.  If we both parred it, I would have won.  Like my putt, I sent it seven feet over.  I had to make that in order to win.  I was like, "Oh, God, I'm kind of tired.  I don't want to play anymore."  I was like, "Okay, I've got to make this."  That ended up going in.  That's when I knew I won.  
 
Q.  Was that your second putt?  Tell me about that hole, 16.  What did you hit to the green first? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I hit a 3-wood. 
 
Q.  And you were on the green? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I was on the green, yeah.  My opponent, yeah, she was on the green, too.  
 
Q.  She was further away?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  How long was your first putt, would you say? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I had like probably 20 feet, I think.  I have no idea.  
 
Q.  It went seven feet past?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah, it went quite a few past.  She stuck it. 
 
Q.  So how close was she? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  She was, I don't know  -- well, after she putted, it was, you know, within (indicating).  
 
Q.  Close?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  So you had to make it?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  You should be very proud. 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Thanks.  
 
Q.  Now, this is the biggest thing you've done in golf, to be in the semifinals of the United States National Championship.  How does that make you feel? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Actually, I didn't think I was going to get this far.  I'm just kind of in shock.  Not shock, but, you know, not believing it.  Yeah, I'm really happy, excited to play.  
 
Q.  You're still in high school?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah.  I'm going to be a senior.  
 
Q.  You're very young.  Aree Wongluekiet is very young.  Why do you think all the young players are doing so well?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I think it's because  -- maybe it's because they just practice, you know, practice more.  I think it's because of practicing, you know.  Our parents are, you know, kind of strict.  We just practice. 
 
Q.  Now, you were born in this country?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q.  Where were your parents born?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  They were born in Korea. 
 
Q.  So is this something that Koreans do?  You say your parents are strict.  Asian players are doing very well.  Is there a difference in the way Asian children are raised, even though you're an American? 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Like, if I'm an American and they're Asian?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah, I think in Asia, people  -- I hear stories like how they don't go to school, and they just do golf all the time.  They're really strict on that.  They sometimes get like physical like hit, I guess, sometimes in order to try to get better.  But in America, you have the opportunity to do education and golf.  I think it's better.  Yeah, I think people in Asia, they kind of are a little strict. 
 
Q.  More focused on one thing?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah, on one thing. 
 
Q.  What do you do besides go to school and play golf?  What else do you like to do?  I read you like to go to amusement parks.
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah.  My friends and I, we have this thing where we try to go maybe once or twice a year.  So I think after this tournament, I start school in September, so I'm hoping I can go before school starts, just a day of relaxing.  I haven't been home in a month because I've been out here golfing.  I'd really like a day to just, you know, relax (laughter).  
 
Q.  What is your favorite ride?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I have a lot of them.  The White Colossus.  It's at Magic Mountain.  
 
Q.  So you're a roller-coaster person?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q.  You like the thrills and spills?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Golf must seem pretty calm after that. 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  No, no, not really.  
 
Q.  You putt pretty well.  Is that the strength of your game?  I noticed today, especially on the early side of the match, you were getting up-and-down.  I think you had the first seven holes, maybe five 1-putts?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Actually, my putting was working really well for this match.  Before, I was just doing, "Maybe I'll make it in," stuff like that.  But for this match, it was going in.  I was kind of surprised. 
 
Q.  What high school do you go to?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Arcadia High School.  
 
Q.  How did you do last week?  You know you played well in Stroke Play. 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah, but I lost my first match. 
 
Q.  Who did you lose to?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Lauren Gant. 
 
Q.  After losing a first round match there, what kind of expectations do you come here with, playing with older kids?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Like, well, I'm really not a matchplay person.  
 
YVONNE CHOE:  It's not my favorite thing.  Before I came here, people just said, "Just pretend it's Stroke Play."  That's what I did.  I think it's helped.  
 
Q.  Who is your caddie?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  My caddie is my coach. 
 
Q.  Golf coach?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Golf coach in high school or swing coach?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Swing coach. 
 
Q.  What is his name?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Jay Chang.  
 
Q.  What do you think it's going to be like going back to high school, telling your friends about this, making it to the semifinals of the biggest women's amateur event?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I guess they'll probably be surprised.  I'm not sure if they really know what semifinals are and finals are in golf.  They'll just be like, "Congratulations," something like that.  I don't know.  
 
Q.  Most of your friends from school don't play golf or they do?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  They don't.  
 
Q.  Do you like that?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Actually, if I try to explain something to them, it's kind of frustrating because they don't know anything about it (laughter).  But I think it's okay, I guess.  Yeah, because like some of them, they think golf is like  -- some of my friends who play basketball, it's like, "You get to drive around in a cart, and we have to run."  I can't explain like it's totally frustrating and stuff.  They don't get that.  
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I played, but I like almost lost my first match.  That's probably why I don't like it that much. 
 
Q.  How far did you get last week?
 
RHONDA GLENN:  Lost the first round.  
 
Q.  Lost the first round?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  What were you thinking after you won your first match?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Over here?  
 
Q.  Yes, this week. 
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I was just like, "Okay, I can go home now (laughter)."  My dad, he just told, "If you win your first match," because my mom is back home, "everyone is going to be happy.  Doesn't matter what you do now."  We totally were not expecting this (laughter).  
 
Q.  Did you have to change reservations?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  Yes. 
 
Q.  You had to change plane reservations?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  For the hotel?  
 
Q.  If you said you weren't expecting to get this far, were you expecting to go home?  Did you have your plane reservations earlier in the week?  When were you supposed to fly home?
 
YVONNE CHOE:  I don't know.  I didn't ask my dad about that.  
 
Q.  How many AJGA events have you won?

YVONNE CHOE:  I have no idea.

YVONNE CHOE:  I don't know.
