   WOODY AUSTIN: I knew, basically what it was, yeah, I threw it away. I didn't hit the ball close enough to the hole the last two holes to counteract my yips that I have when it comes to putting. Nobody's fault but my own, so that's two weeks in a row. So I've got to figure it out or I'd better quit.

 Q. One of those things where you need to get back out there and get at it again?
 WOODY AUSTIN: I would say yes if we were playing tomorrow, because I can't play much better for four straight days. I had two bad shots today and unfortunately that swing on the last hole, the wind gusted and switched and still probably the most solid shot I hit all week at the wrong time, and just I said it yesterday, I can't put pressure on my putter and I did, and you know, I threw away shots on the front nine again today, and I should have been so far ahead to where I could have messed it up. 

 Q. Did you watch --
 WOODY AUSTIN: I watched a little bit. I knew I had some work -- inaudible -- I never want to leave a downhill putt for my second shot and I hit that first putt obviously way too hard. 
 But you know, like I said, if you watched me putt all week, I should have won the tournament by ten shots the way I played.
