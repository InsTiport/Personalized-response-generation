  Q. Woody, nice 68 to open. Tell me about it.  
 WOODY AUSTIN: Smoke and mirrors.   
  
  Q. (Laughs). A little of that?  
 WOODY AUSTIN: Yeah. Just not -- I mean I'm not playing very well and I'm not confident. So I'm just really -- I'm really kind of just trying to scramble my way around, and I did a good job.  
 I only really hit one really bad shot to where I was in major trouble, but I never really gave myself a ton of birdie chances.   
 And then on the back nine I finally hit a few good shots and knocked it close for eagle on 7 and made it.  
  
  Q. I was going to say, tell me about that eagle on 7.  
 WOODY AUSTIN: Yeah. It was a perfect drive. Hit a rescue in there about 10 feet behind the hole and finally knocked one in.   
  
  Q. Gets you in with 68. I mean you know what's at stake this week for all the guys around here, and you've been there before. You just have to play it? What's the mindset?  
 WOODY AUSTIN: It's just, like I said, I'm just trying to figure out a way to get it around. I got -- like I said, I'm smoke and mirrors is about all I can say. I'm trying something -- I tried to figure something out yesterday, and I'm trying something on the golf course I never thought I'd try.  
  
  Q. What's that?  
 WOODY AUSTIN: And I got through it today. I moved the ball in my stance farther than I ever thought possible.   
  
  Q. Oh.  
 WOODY AUSTIN: So I'm doing some like I said, smoke and mirrors, and I'm just trying to get it around and get it in the hole and see if I can figure out a way to do that, and today I was able to do it. So hopefully I can do it tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Good luck to you. Keep going. Keep fooling 'em.  
 WOODY AUSTIN: Thanks. I'm trying.
