 Q. Is this a good sign for the week to come? 
 WOODY AUSTIN: No, this has nothing to do with that golf course. I don't have hit -- the only wedges I hit are on my third and fourth shots on the regular golf course.

 Q. Obviously you're aware of the jinx; did you miss that putt on No. 9 on purpose?
 WOODY AUSTIN: I don't believe in that. I don't believe in that. Every streak loses, every streak gains, every jinx -- everything is broken. So that jinx will be broken eventually, so why worry about it. 

 Q. Can you talk about your outlook for the week, what are you trying to do? Obviously you know what you are trying to do but what do you think your chances are? 
 WOODY AUSTIN: To be totally honest, I would not say my chances are all that good. The golf course is just way too long for me. But, if I play great and putt well, then I'm going to have a chance but I'm going to have to play really good because this golf course is just too long for me.
