 Q.  You played some U.S. Open golf last year.  Do you think that --  
WOODY AUSTIN: No.  It's not going to help me at all.   
Whether you're playing the golf course a million times, you're playing bad, you're playing bad.  I drove the ball the worst I've done in 20 years, so it doesn't matter if you've played the golf course or not.   
 Q.  Driving, obviously, you were in the rough a lot today?  
WOODY AUSTIN: Yeah.  I drove it in the crap all day long.   
 Q.  Is it something that just came out of nowhere?  
WOODY AUSTIN: No.  I've been playing bad for the last 3 months, 3 1/2 months.  I haven't driven it this bad, but it always shows up more in an Open when you finally have some rough.  It's fine by me.  I think it should happen that way more often.  It's just when you play like a dog, you play like a dog.   
 Q.  Obviously, you won three times early in the year.  Is it just the driving that's been a problem for you just recently?  
WOODY AUSTIN: No.  I think I sold my soul to the devil when I won, and now I can't play golf worth a crap.  No matter what I do, I can't do anything right.  So maybe -- you know, looking back, obviously, it's good to win, but I don't know if I really wanted this much garbage golf just because I won.
