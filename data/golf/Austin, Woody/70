WOODY AUSTIN:  Low scores, bad weather, hang on.

The fact that we haven't lift clean and placed it yet, with all the rain, the greens are holding up magnificently well.  So it's doing pretty darn good.
Q.  You've had some good rounds here in the past.  And maybe on Sunday, a couple that you'd like to forget.  How much of that do you want to
WOODY AUSTIN:  You know, nobody wants to remember bad Sundays, no matter where you're at.  So just going to try to do my best to keep doing what I did today.  I played really good today.  I played real patient.  And it came about there at the end of the ruined.  If I can do that tomorrow, I'll maybe have a great chance.
Q.  What was your feeling on 16?
WOODY AUSTIN:  It was pretty good.  I thought it went in.  Everybody went pretty crazy.  I saw it hit the flag.  And then we also saw it just next to the hole.  But we were kind of surprised it would hit the flag and stay next to the hole.  But when we got up there, it made a lot of sense why it stayed so close to the hole.
Q.  On 17?
WOODY AUSTIN:  17, I hit about 2 feet.  I felt like I hit some great shots late in the round.  I gave myself a whole bunch of chances.  I had it close at 13 and made it.  Missed the one on 14 and hit the hole on 15, really bad lip out on 16, the worst I've seen in a while.  And then 17.  And now I've just got to get it up and down on 18 and it will be a great finish.
