Q.
Tell me about your round today.
WOODY AUSTIN:  A little bit up and down early.  I didn't make a par until the 6th hole.  I birdied out, birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey, birdie.  But I've been playing well for a while, just haven't putted well, and then all of a sudden two and a half weeks ago I switched putters and I've been putting really good and the scores are indicative.  I think that's nine in a row that I've shot under par now in rounds.  It's just a matter of getting the ball in the hole.  I'm getting the ball in the hole now.
Q.  Is the course playing pretty difficult?
WOODY AUSTIN:  I wouldn't say it's playing difficult.  I'd say it's playing fairly tough, I guess, kind of a way of saying it.  It's not real hard from the fairway, but if you hit the ball off line, you not only have the rough, you have the trees.  You're going to get penalized for your bad shots, but yet you're going to get rewarded for the good ones because the course is very fair.
Q.  What do you think of the competition out there?
WOODY AUSTIN:  Well, I mean, it's always great when you're playing against the best players in the world, and it is considered a major, so they're always    as they say, this is what they prime themselves for, so you know they're all at the top of their game.  It's nice to compete with those guys on top of their game and try and beat them.
Q.  How do you feel about your position?
WOODY AUSTIN:  I mean, I'm obviously not out of it.  I've given myself a good start, and that's the whole key is to give myself a good start so I have a chance on the weekend.  Now I've got a chance going into Saturday and Sunday and we'll see how it goes, and hopefully the swing will stay where it's at and the putter will stay hot and I'll give myself a good chance.
