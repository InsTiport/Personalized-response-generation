 Q.  68, how would you assess your play out there today?  
WOODY AUSTIN: 13 holes, looked like a player.  The last five looked like say 12-handicap.  About right.  So the first 13 holes, I was like the old man -- I was like a young man, hit every shot how I wanted to, where I wanted to, was never in trouble.   
And then the last five holes, I looked like a 12-handicap.  Hit a couple bad drives.  I had not hit a bad drive, so I got myself in a couple spots I had not been in all day and it really screwed up 14 from perfect.  So that's the way it goes.   
 Q.  How much does it weigh on your mind, playing a link course like this and trying to avoid all the bunkers?  
WOODY AUSTIN: That's the key.  I told myself, that's the thing you try to do all day.  I hit one on 13, which was my first one, and it just -- you just tell yourself, that's the one place you don't want to miss is in one of these bunkers because it is an actual full penalty.  If you're going to miss, you want to make sure you miss way from them and I did a great job till 13.   
 Q.  What kind of things are you looking to improve on for tomorrow?  
WOODY AUSTIN: Like I said, I really did everything right until the end.  I've just got to make sure that I don't throw away a good round.  It's hard enough -- it's a good golf course.   
There's a lot of long irons for us because again, you're trying to avoid the bunkers, so when we are laying back on like the young guys, we're hitting 3-irons and 4-irons into the par fours and 5-irons and what have you.  You've got to really be on your game that way, and you just can't throw away a good round like that when you've got it going pretty good.
