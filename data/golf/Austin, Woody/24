 Q. Off to good start, birdies on 1, 5, 9. What happened on the back? 
 WOODY AUSTIN: Just a terrible finish, I'm pretty pissed off at myself. Under par on this golf course is good, so I like that. But when you have a chance to shoot a low score on this course, you can't throw it away like that.

 Q. Talk about the finish. What happened? 
 WOODY AUSTIN: 16 is a tough driving hole. I hit a bad drive. And then just didn't hit a great chip. My short game has been letting me down. 
 And then 17, I hit the shot I was supposed to hit right in the middle of the green, you know, and 3-putt.

 Q. Talk about being back home, this is usually a nice thing for people around here. 
 WOODY AUSTIN: Sure, it's always nice to come home. I love bermudagrass since I grew up on bermudagrass. Can't stand California and the poa annua. Unfortunately that's where the year starts. And I can't practice at home, either, in Wichita because it's too cold. So, not a good starting combination. 
 So I love it when we finally get out of California and get to Florida. 

 Q. Do you hear from people from Chamberlain High?
 WOODY AUSTIN: I still have my circle of friends from here, a couple of guys that I graduated with, a couple of them will be out tomorrow. I'll have quite a few friends tomorrow.

 Q. You've never missed a cut here; so that's got to feel good. 
 WOODY AUSTIN: Yeah, but I've never really contended, either. It's nice that I know how to play the course, but I've never played good. Today I had a chance to play good, and I threw it away. That's just very disappointing. 

 Q. Another day?
 WOODY AUSTIN: Yeah.
