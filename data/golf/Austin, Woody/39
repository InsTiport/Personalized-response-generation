 Q.  Obviously not the finish you wanted today but a good week as a whole? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  Yeah, good week as a whole, just that's not the way I want to lose.  You want to lose by getting beat.  You don't want to lose by beating yourself.  And I beat myself today.  There is always a winner and a loser, but you don't want to beat yourself, and I beat myself today. 

 Q.  Any one or two particular shots you're kicking yourself over? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  The drive on 7 and the tee shot on 8 killed me today.  I've got all the momentum and I didn't even make him play a hole.  That's ridiculous. 

 Q.  You're pretty strong at match play? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  It does suit my personality.  I struggled from that tee shot on 7 all the way.  I just gave him -- I gave him 10 too easy and then seems like when my back is against the wall I seem to start hitting some good shots. 
 And then I hit two awesome putts on 13 and 14 that didn't go in to give me any momentum and then he makes another long one on 15.  So I needed one of my long ones to go in and he made two of them. 
 But at least I made him finish.  I'll take a little positive in that at least I made him finish, but I'm still pretty upset with myself.
