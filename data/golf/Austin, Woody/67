 Q.  Conditions out there I saw you on 14, the par 3, you said go get 'em.  I said I'm trying.  Difficult golf course to gain anything on? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  I was playing pretty good.  I only missed a couple shots leading into there and missed a couple here at the end, but I hit a lot of good shots.  I only made two putts under five feet, so I really didn't make too much.  So I mean I had my chances but I mean to really shoot a good score, I had to make a 15, 20-footer.  Didn't make them. 

 Q.  You've been playing good coming into this event.  Is there something starting to click for you? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  I'm hoping so.  It's been such a frustrating year.  I'm definitely starting to hit the ball better.  I never put myself in trouble off the tee today except for one shot and as long as I do that and keep it in play it's just a matter of whether or not you can score. 
 The key is scoring.  I shot a good score today but you got to shoot better sometimes. 

 Q.  Woody, thank you.  Good luck on Sunday. 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  Sure, no problem.
