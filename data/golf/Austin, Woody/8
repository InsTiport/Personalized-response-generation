 Q.  Just talk about the week in general for you.  WOODY AUSTIN: Disappointing.  And in the end, very embarrassing.   Q.  How about your thoughts on the golf course.  WOODY AUSTIN: The golf course is awesome.  The golf course could have been even better.  Disappointed that the USGA didn't set it up like it should have been.  There's too many easy holes out there.  They set the course up way too easy.  I don't know if they're upset with the fact that they take the abuse from the young guys when they set up a golf course hard like last week or whatever, but this golf course could have been incredible, and they set it up way too easy. There's too many guys under par, too many 64s, too many 63s.  That's not a U.S. Open.   Q.  What did you think about the closing stretch?  That seemed to give some guys some trouble.  WOODY AUSTIN: Well, good.  Like I said, great golf course.  Awesome golf course.  They just set it up too easy, that's all.  They made the -- you don't set up 15 as a 535-yard par 5 on Sunday.  You don't do all the things they did to make the golf course play easy.  Sunday is not supposed to play easy.  Sunday, you're supposed to see what this golf course is made of. Sunday's not supposed to show 63s and 64s because we played a bunch of tees up and they tried to allow you to hit 3 woods on par 4s onto the greens.  That's not a Sunday U.S. Open.  U.S. Open is supposed to show the teeth on Sunday, and they made this golf course show nothing, for such a great golf course.
