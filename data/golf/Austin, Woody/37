 Q.  People here say this course gets more difficult when the wind starts to pick up, and you were talking about a minute ago on the back nine it was starting to pick up? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  Yeah, it's been blowing pretty good now for the past couple hours.  The greens were already pretty firm to begin with at the start of the week, so with the wind it's just going to dry them out that much more, and they're just going to get firmer and faster. 

 Q.  Is the belief that if you play in the morning it's a bit more of an advantage because the weather changes so much in a city like this? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  Well, obviously if you get out and you get going, you have an advantage because the greens are a little moister, a little softer.  Obviously we didn't get a perfect day in that we played all 18 holes without the wind.  It's been blowing since the 7th hole.  It's not like we got out there and played a perfect 18 and it just started blowing like a half hour ago. 
 From that standpoint, we didn't steal one from the morning round, but again, the first so many holes before the greens dried out were probably a little better. 

 Q.  Obviously the key to winning any tournament is getting off to a good start.  You've got to like the 69 that you're at right now? 
 WOODY AUSTIN:  Absolutely.  You know, that's been a problem.  I haven't gotten off to too many good starts on Thursdays.  Haven't shot any real low rounds at all.  I think this probably tied for my low round of the year.  It's a good start.  For the way the course is going to play, as long as the wind keeps blowing and the weather holds off, it's going to get to where 69 is going to be a great score every day.
