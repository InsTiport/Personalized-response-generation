Q. How did you do today?
ANNIE PARK: It was great.  No, I had a lot of fun.  They were both very nice.  We kept it very light out there.  My golf wasn't falling in there, but compared to yesterday, I wanted a little bit more of a steady card, maybe more birdies.  But just some of the putts weren't dropping in.  I had some really good putts.  It just wasn't my day.
Q. That's all right.  You got to play with Alfonso.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, that was great.  It was awesome.  I mean, growing up watching Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and playing with Patrick, so it was very different on the 1st tee, but we had a great time out there.  We got to know each other a little bit, share some stories.  It was great.
Q. And I think I heard him inviting you over to play golf in L.A.?
ANNIE PARK: In California, yeah.  So we kind of have a similar background, New York and then he now lives in California.  So just a little bit of both worlds.  So we were just talking about that and which golf courses we grew up playing in.
