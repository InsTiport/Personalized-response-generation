Q. Very fun day I'm assuming.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, it was fun.
Q. Yeah.  Looked like you had a good day.
ANNIE PARK: It was good to have my mom back on the bag.  We had a great time out there.  I mean, the last time she caddied was in Hawaii, so April.
So she's happy to be back, too.
Q. Awesome.  How did that come about?  You just say, Mom, come to France?
ANNIE PARK: Well my sister came too, so this is her first event as me playing as a professional.  So we actually came manage early, go in Paris and Lausanne, so it was a good trip for me before the tournament.
Then just a good tournament so far with my family.
Q. What did you do in Paris?
ANNIE PARK: What did we do?  We went to four landmarks in like half a day.  So exhausted.
Q. Knocked it out.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, took the train; got there around 10:00, 11:00, and then went to Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, and then the Eiffel Tower, and then I don't remember the other two.  We went to like --
PERSON: Arc de Triomphe.
ANNIE PARK: Oh.  We went to the cathedral, and then we went to go see Mona Lisa.
Q. So Notre Dam and then the Louvre.  Did you go up the tower?
ANNIE PARK: Yes, we did.
Q. How high?
ANNIE PARK: Like the highest.
Q. Really?
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, we just took a picture and came back.
Q. That's all there is to do.
ANNIE PARK: But we walked the Champs all the way up.  So tiring.  Like 240 stairs, I think.
Q. Yeah.
ANNIE PARK: I regretted why I did that, but it was worth it in the end.
Q. You paid for it.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah.
Q. That's unusual for players.  A lot of players don't get a chance to do that.  They just focus on the event.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah.
Q. Was that unusual for you?
ANNIE PARK: Well, this was actually the first one that we actually went to somewhere else and did something for fun.  One of the reasons was for my sister.  It's her vacation.
So I think, yeah, it's just another family vacation.
Q. Relax you a little bit?
ANNIE PARK: Well, I don't know about all the walking.  It was pretty tiring.  But it was fun.  A lot of fun.
Q. What is you sister's name?
ANNIE PARK: Bo, B-o.
Q. Okay.  Younger?
ANNIE PARK: Older.  I get that a lot.  She looks younger than me.
Q. What does she do when she's not on vacation?
ANNIE PARK: My mom and my sister own two nail salons.  She manages the other one.
Q. What's it like playing with your mom?
ANNIE PARK: I mean, we grew up -- I mean, she caddied for me growing up.  I mean, I'm always used to her being on the bag.
This year was a little bit different because it was my first time having a tour caddie besides her caddying for me.
I don't know.  It's just fun with her on the bag.  She keeps it light.  She does dances out there.  Kind of embarrasses me, but keeps the group fun, so...
Q. She dance today at all?
ANNIE PARK: She -- yeah, she used to dance a lot last year.
Q. But today?
ANNIE PARK: No, no.
Q. On the eagle.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, she kept it low-key today.
Q. So even though you got 7-under you didn't earn a dance?
ANNIE PARK: No.  She kept it light, like giving me these hearts.
Q. What kind of hearts?
ANNIE PARK: So in Korea these are like hearts.  These are hearts.
Q. That's so cute.
ANNIE PARK: So she would be like winking with me.  Like, I've never winked at someone.  You're the first person.  You should be grateful.
I'm like, Just don't do it.  (Laughter.)  Please don't do it.
Q. That's fantastic.
ANNIE PARK: She still keeps me embarrassed.
Q. That's a good thing, though?
ANNIE PARK: It's fun.  I like her being on the bag.
Q. That's great.  Did you see this round coming at all?
ANNIE PARK: No.
Q. This is one off your low round of the year.
ANNIE PARK: I was actually a little bit worried coming in because I just changed to the iBlades coming from the iIrons before that, before the model.  So it was my first time playing with blades.
Q. Are they pink?
ANNIE PARK: In my like --
Q. In your life?
ANNIE PARK: -- golf career I guess.  It feels great.  I love it.  I mean, I didn't know my yardages coming in so I had to figure that out in the practice rounds.  Good thing I figured that out with my rep, and then it was a good -- yeah, it is good.
Q. You're one off the lead at the moment.  Give you any pressure for tomorrow or not thinking about that?
ANNIE PARK: I mean, just trying to have fun with my mom is my goal.  Thinking about what's happening in the present moment is my goal always for golf and life, too.  I think that's what I'm going to try to do tomorrow.
Q. Missed a few cuts coming into this.  What was a little off prior to this week?
ANNIE PARK: I don't know.  Maybe changing the irons and knowing my yardages was probably a huge key for me.  I mean, I had some pretty good putts out there.  I had some good strokes.
So, I mean, I played well the past two tournaments that I missed the cut, and then the last tournament it was just -- just happened.  So, I mean, yeah.
Q. So you give credit to the equipment change?
ANNIE PARK: Sure.  (Laughter.)
Q. Tell us about the eagle.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, so I hit a good drive; hit a good second shot; then I had a 35, 36 feet to the putt.
It was like right-to-left I think.  I think it was right-to-left or it was left-to-right.
But I hit a good stroke.  It was actually pretty aggressive, so thankfully it went in.
