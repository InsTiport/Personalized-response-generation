Q. ... for putting the first point on the board this late afternoon and a tough day. Was that one of the most epic battles you've ever gone through?
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, it was just back and forth the whole day. Both teams played some great golf in these conditions. We hit some really great shots, both teams.
Q. You're right. It was a tight match back and forth, back and forth. Describe where you pulled from, to pull off some of those shots, particularly like that shot at 17, when things were so, so tough out there?
ANNIE PARK: I was telling Brittany going in, I like this hole. And honestly I was very comfortable with punch shots and I had it in the bag, and I'm just glad I pulled it off. I think the last three holes were great punch shots for me.
Q. What do you think Captain Inkster is going to say to you, two rookies going out there and getting a big one, going up against Suzann Pettersen and a future superstar in Anne van Dam?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Puts things together, and when she does the job. I've played with Annie since --
ANNIE PARK: Like a decade.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Like a decade. Happy to play with her.
ANNIE PARK: I wanted to add that it's always nice to see Suzann playing out here again. And she's still got it. She's got so much swag. And she's a trouper. And it's tough out there but I'm glad we got it done today.
Q. Great win, wasn't it, really, in awful conditions?
ANNIE PARK: It was tough out there. I'm so glad I played the Scottish Open, and it was like this, maybe even worse. But I'm glad that I got that practice out. And I was prepared for this one. And I think we both were.
Q. And you were always in front. They never at any stage were in front. But they were tough opponents, weren't they?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it was back and forth all day. Both teams hit some incredible shots in this weather. Annie got on 17 and that was just incredible, just what we needed to get the rhythm going.
Q. Annie, in terms of the team, it was an important point as well, wasn't it?
ANNIE PARK: For sure. I think out there we were just playing our game and focusing on the battle. So we weren't worrying about how important it was, but we definitely knew how important the match was.
Q. Clearly, Brittany, it's is going to be tight in the singles tomorrow?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Exactly. But I think we're all prepared and we're ready to play for Juli and our country. And I think we're all excited to get out there again.
Q. How tough were those conditions?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It was brutal. Like 16, I will say I -- we both added 30 yards. Mine was still short.
ANNIE PARK: Felt like (indiscernible).
Q. Describe it.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I hit a good drive. And then the third shot I hit a good shot and it was almost on the green.
Q. Would you say that was a (inaudible) win?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Probably.
Q. Was that a real pivotal hole, really, because the European players, both 3-putters, was that the hole that really turned it for you?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: We both hit some good shots to give us putts. And they were pretty good. And Annie's shot on 17 was incredible. It was just what we needed at that time.
ANNIE PARK: Once the winds started to pick up real bad on 16, I knew it was going to get very tight coming up and 16 and 17 and 18.
Q. And your sense, your captain gets a point on the board, that's a lot of responsibility, must be really proud?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Very proud.
