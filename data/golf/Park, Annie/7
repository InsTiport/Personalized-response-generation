Q. How good does it feel to keep yourself in and give yourself a chance to qualify for Solheim Cup here?
ANNIE PARK: To be honest I was playing pretty well.  I was 2-under going into 17, and it was just the wind started to be a monster.  The rain started to pick up.  I'm just glad that I'm finished.  It was such a long day out there.  You know what, I'm glad I'm done, and now I can just relax.  It was five hours of pretty much torture in this weather.
Q. Seeing the weather as it was, do you think it gives the U.S. captain a bit of a show of what sort of character you are to put up a fight today and make the cut?
ANNIE PARK: Honestly, I grew up playing similar links golf course, so it brings back feels of back home.  Junior golf, we always played in this weather.  Almost we had to play in the snow.  I had fun out there.  It was challenging for sure but I had some pretty good shots out there and pretty good putts.  So yeah, hopefully that's a consideration possibly.
Q. Looking to the weekend, do you have a number in mind?  Obviously a win is in your mind, but anything beyond that?
ANNIE PARK: Honestly, I wish I could get some birdies, less bogeys.  Under par is my ultimate goal.  That was my goal today and came out bogey, bogey on the last holes.  But there's always tomorrow and Sunday.  So we'll see what happens.
