 Q.  So is that your family that's following you around?  
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, that's my family.  Yeah, my whole family.  Well, except my second oldest sister.  She couldn't make it because of work.  That's my mom, dad, oldest sister and brother-in-law.  My oldest sister is pregnant, so...   
 Q.  Awesome.  Congrats to her.  
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, it's exciting.  Can't wait to be an aunt.   
 Q.  So bogey-free round today that took longer than expected.  
ANNIE PARK: Yeah.   
 Q.  What was today like for you?  
ANNIE PARK: I mean, it's kind of a long day with the delay and stuff, but it's been a great day.  I hit some great putts.  I holed out for a birdie.  That was in the long stuff, and that was kind of the start of my momentum of all my birdies.   
Hit some great putts.  I mean, the greens are obviously not that easy to read, but just committed to my lines and it was good.   
 Q.  Where was that hole-out and what were the specifics there?  
ANNIE PARK: Hole-out, I think it was on 7 or 6.  Maybe 6.  6?  Uh-huh, 6.  I was on the left.  I had to punch out and then it was one hop in.  I thought it went over.  I was like, Wait, did that go in?   
So, yeah, that was a cool shot.  Holed out there.  It was nice because my second tournament holing out.  In Ann Arbor I holed out the 1st hole of my third round, so that was exciting.   
So, yeah, it was just pretty cool.   
 Q.  How far do you think you were?  
ANNIE PARK: On 6?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ANNIE PARK: I hit a 9 and it was 124 yards.   
 Q.  Oh, awesome.  
ANNIE PARK: I think I landed around 123; just hopped in.   
 Q.  Been playing really well this year.  What's been the secret to your success?  
ANNIE PARK: I mean, I think just committing to what I'm doing.  So just kind of trying to focus on short-term goals.  Putting has been great, so yeah.  It's going to be a long summer, long season, so just trying to keep my body not tired.  Keep it in check.   
That's my goal.   
 Q.  How often do your family get to see you in person?  
ANNIE PARK: My brother-in-law's first LPGA event, so it's exciting for him.   
 Q.  Cool.  
ANNIE PARK: Oldest sister, she hasn't seen me since middle school, me playing, so that's great.   
Mom used to caddie for me out here, so it's exciting for her to be outside of the ropes.   
My dad has always supported me, so it's cool.   
 Q.  To be able to play well and put yourself at the top of the leaderboard has to feel pretty good, too.  
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, I still have another round to play, so just try to focus on that and have a good rest.   
 Q.  What's your mindset for tomorrow?  
ANNIE PARK: Tomorrow, just focus on each shot.  I mean, I don't know about the rain delay and stuff, but just doing the best what I can do and just focusing on my own game.  That's my goal.
