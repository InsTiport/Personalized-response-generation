Q.   Talk about the way the round went, your gut reaction?
ANNIE PARK:   I started out well.   The third hole‑‑ well, the third hole for me, I miscalculated the yardage, so I had a tough break there. 
From there on, I just triedto get my game back together.   It was‑‑ I was just struggling out there just trying to make putts, getting it on the green.

Q.   You had four three-puts today, you are playing in the afternoon.   Were the greens tougher, do you think? 
ANNIE PARK:   I mean, towards the end I was actually putting better except for one hole.   But I was putting better.   I gave my best effort and it didn't go in.   It was frustrating, but what can I do?   Can't control the greens.

Q.   You had all these people out here following you.   Did that put any extra pressure on yourself to perform for them? 
ANNIE PARK:   I mean, I did feel the pressure, but like I tried to block it out.   I mean, I was very thankful for them to come out and watch and support our group and it was just great.

Q.   Tomorrow will be an easier round just getting this out of the way? 
ANNIE PARK:   I think so.   I mean, hopefully I get some‑‑ I get my putting back together.   My shots they were kind of iffy.   Just it's going to be a new day and hopefully it's better.

Q.   Can you describe your emotion on the first hole when you were teeing off? 
ANNIE PARK:   I mean, like every tournament, everyone gets nervous.   I was nervous but I hit a great drive.   I had great second shot.   I lipped out the putt.   But after that it wasn't too bad.

Q.   On No. 4, you had a big drive down there, the short par‑4 downhill.   It seemed like this might be your chance to make a birdie to get you going.   What happened? 
ANNIE PARK:   I kind of pushed my wedge.   I didn't want to hit it left, so I guess I tried not to hit it left and then I pushed it right.

Q.   The three‑putt there, that must have been the frustrating moment of the day for you?
ANNIE PARK:   Actually, it's funny because my par putt, I was so confident in making that putt and then I misread the putt.   I was like, okay, I'll just move on.   I missed the next putt, and I was just like okay. 
After that I was trying to get my game‑‑ tried to make some birdies, but it didn't work out.

Q.   Was Sebonack very much different from the courses you've played a number of times?   They set it up differently. 
ANNIE PARK:   Yeah, they did set it up differently.   The only thing was No. 2 being No. 1 and 1 being No. 9.   That was kind of confusing and I'm still confused.   But overall, I mean, the course was in great shape.

Q.   You mentioned the pressure.   What about support?   Did you feel like there were a lot of people supporting you out there?
ANNIE PARK:   Yes, it was.   Also at the same time it was kind of pressuring.   I'm glad that I experienced this now than later.   I'm grateful for that.

Q.   Is it because you can hear a gallery reaction?   You don't usually have that? 
ANNIE PARK:   It was different because me seeing Tiger play and all the crowds supporting them, and then me being in the‑‑ me experiencing it myself was pretty cool.

Q.   What was that feeling like on the first tee when they‑‑ you were playing in front of these Long Islanders.   They announced from Levittown, New York, Annie Park.   What goes through your head and your heart?
ANNIE PARK:   I was just so honored to be part of Long Island.   And me being a resident in Levittown, I'm grateful. 
I also like Sebonack being on an Island is just great.

Q.   Obviously you are going to try to come back tomorrow and make the cut.   What do you‑‑ what kind of plan to you take?   What kind of approach do you take?   Do you forget this right away?   What do you do next?
ANNIE PARK:   I mean, it's kind of hard to forget about it because I think that was one of the things coming into this tournament was I had a bad last round before this, and it kind of like‑‑ it was in me and it was hard for me to get it over with. 
Today it was worse.   So I mean, hopefully tomorrow is going to be a different day and just going to try to change my mindset.

Q.   Is it possible that you kind of lost your rhythm between that because you were doing other things instead of playing golf? 
ANNIE PARK:   Kind of hard to like get back‑‑ I mean, I had some bogeys.   I had tried to get back into a momentum.   But I was struggling out there in general.
