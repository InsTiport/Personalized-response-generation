 Q.  Great round today, 3-under 68.  What were you particularly happy with?  
ANNIE PARK: I think just overall my game.  I've been doing pretty good.  Figured out my swing a little bit.  Added a new putter last week; kind of warmed up to it this week.   
Yeah, a lot of the new stuff happening this week.   
 Q.  You've probably played a couple practice rounds here.  How is the course playing today?  Differently to the practice rounds?  
ANNIE PARK: I would say yes.  When I played it was a little bit more wet.  The greens were a little slower and softer.  Today it firmed up.  Greens were a lot quicker.   
Just a little tougher.  (Shout out to her friend Sue Ann.)   
 Q.  One word on that as well.  Apparently there was a huge amount of food consumed between you two in Charleston.  There is a story about that?  Take us through it.  
ANNIE PARK: That was nothing compared to back in the days.  We used to definitely have a food adventure.  It's always a great time with Sue Ann.  We always love to eat - healthy food as well.   
We cannot ever miss on dessert, so...
