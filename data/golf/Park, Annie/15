Q. What was the story for you today?
ANNIE PARK: Today just trying to stay cool out there.  It was pretty hot.  It was really windy out there.  So just trying to judge the wind correctly.  The winds are swirling, so it was kind of hard to judge if it was left-to-right wind or right-to-left.  But overall it was a good day.  I hit some great shots, and made some good putts.
Q. Did it feel different coming in an a major now with a victory under your belt?
ANNIE PARK: Yes and no.  Yes, because this is my third year, so just because of that I'm a little bit more, know what to do.  No, because it's the same golf that we're playing, just trying to do the same routine, same focus.  So nothing's really changed on the course.
Q. Do you feel different though?
ANNIE PARK: Do I feel different?
Q. Do you feel more confident?
ANNIE PARK: Sure.
(Laughter.)
But I think that I've prepared myself for the season and I think I would say I've been prepared and I'm more confident, maybe, but no, I feel the same, playing the same golf, so.
Q. I know you've been asked about this before, but just with the long putter, how is the adjustment?  Was that quite an adjustment for you?
ANNIE PARK: So I've actually -- I'm pretty adaptable to change.  I've putted different styles, short putter -- I'm used to putting just a putter in and figuring it out on the course on round one, or changing irons, driver.  So it's actually it wasn't that big of a change.  I think I would say the weight of the putter was kind of different.  Just putting it that way and just the way -- especially with the longer putts.  But I think I adjusted well within like a week, just practicing on the putting green and on the course.
