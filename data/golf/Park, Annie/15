 Q.  Don't go anywhere.  After that fabulous finish, two birdies, you're just one off the pace.  
ANNIE PARK: Thank you.  It was a great day.  I hit some really great shots.  I struggled the last two tournaments; made some swing changes.  Seems like it worked today.   
I'm going to keep practicing what I'm working on and hit some great shots next week.   
 Q.  Think about right now.  It's not over.  The players are still on the golf course.  The margin is 1 right now.  Were you aware of the situation playing 17 and 18?  
ANNIE PARK: So 17 I hit a great second shot and had about a 12-foot birdie putt.  I hit it and I thought it was in.  I was like, it was going to be an eagle, and I was heartbroken because I just missed.   
Then I hit a great shot on 18 and I knew I was right up on the number, but, I mean, I'm sure the girls are going to play well.  We'll see what happens.   
 Q.  What are going to do now?  
ANNIE PARK: I'm going to go eat, get some stuff to eat.  We'll see.  Waiting in the clubhouse.
