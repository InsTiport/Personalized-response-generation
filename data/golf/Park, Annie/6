Q. 7-under today. By the way, we've heard that's the competitive course record actually. There was a 64 that was noncompetitive. Take us through your round. Pretty amazing.
ANNIE PARK: I was just trying to break my own personal record. Just wanted to go to 9-under. Tough 17th hole, tough break there; had a bogey. Tried to make up for it on the last one and just fell short.
Hopefully maybe tomorrow or this week or someday I can break my own personal record.
Q. You had it an 8-under; what happened on 17?
ANNIE PARK: I was just long and just in the bunker. I thought I had a good judgment and I didn't. I almost chipped in for par and made bogey.
So it was okay. It was just one of the holes.
Q. You had an eagle today on No. 9. Take us through that.
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, so I hit an amazing drive. I knew my 3-wood wouldn't get there so I hit driver off the deck. I didn't hit my best driver off the deck, but it barely went over the bunker; kind of trickled close to the green.
I had about a 30-yard putt and I made the putt, so -- off the green -- so that was a great feeling. I was like, Josh is that short? Is it going in? Is it going to be long? Where is it? Then it just fell in.
It was a great eagle. I think it was one of my best eagles. Then just everything was falling into place kind of after that.
Q. You tee'd off in the afternoon. Did you know the score was minus 6 this morning?
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, I did see it out on the course. There are some scoreboards out there. I just wanted to play my own best. I was up to 8-under and wanted to break my own record and 17 happened. But it's fine; won't take that personally.
Yeah, so it was fine. It was a good round.
Q. Does it take some pressure off with most of the fans following the Canadian players, especially Brooke Henderson? Does that help you focus on your game?
ANNIE PARK: You know, Brooke is a phenomenal player, and not only that, she's a great person. Such a sweetheart. I can see why the fans love her.
But I just was focused on my own game out there. Just tried to play my best. I don't think it really affected me regardless if there were a lot of fans or not.
Q. What do you have to do tomorrow morning to hold on to the lead and maybe add to it?
ANNIE PARK: Just get a good dinner, have a good rest, and bright and early tomorrow.
Q. Do you like that as a player, having the late finish and then the early, or does it really matter?
ANNIE PARK: It doesn't really matter. I think I personally like the afternoon/morning. That way I get a lot of golf in and kind of rest on Friday.
But I think overall, doesn't really matter. Sometimes you can get the bad wave with the weather, so I just always hope for the best wave.
Q. And your take on the golf course? There are 96 bunkers. I guess you found one.
ANNIE PARK: I did find one. I actually found two or three today, so...
Q. Okay. Able to get up and down on those ones?
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, I did. I was in the bunker on one of the par-5s; had a great bunker shot. I mean, after like hitting some good bunker shots I thought, Okay, 17, I got this. Then just misjudgment of the sands. But it was fine. Yep.
Q. And your take on the course overall?
ANNIE PARK: The course is in great shape. I think it's one of the best courses that we've played. Looks great on TV. You know what? As a player I love playing northeastern golf courses. This is great. It's just a real treat this week.
Q. (Regarding Solheim Cup.)
ANNIE PARK: I mean, yeah, definitely a lot of pressure coming into this week just thinking about, you know, it's Solheim right after this event.
You know, I think what really helped was having that one week off. I've played so much golf the last couple weeks. Out of 11 I played ten. Scottish I was in that bad draw and I was like, Oh, my goodness. What kind of weather this is?
But you know what? I think I had a great rest, saw my puppy, and I think coming into this week I was a little bit more refreshed with my body.
Yeah, so I think just kind of playing my best game this week is my goal, and I'm just focusing on my own game.
Q. Certainly want to play your way on to the team, and you can.
ANNIE PARK: Uh-huh.
Q. What is your statement to Captain Inkster about why you should be one of the picks?
ANNIE PARK: I mean, I think I'm pretty persistent of what I want, and if I want something I try really hard to get it. You know what? If I am not the pick I know that her judgment is for the best for the team. Whether I'm playing or not, I root for the team and always USA.
So overall I think she'll have -- it's a tough, tough spot for her even just telling some players no. I don't know if that would be me or not, but I think that's just a tough spot on her and I can't imagine how hard it is.
Q. So you mentioned your Canadian connections. What are they?
ANNIE PARK: So my coach is Canadian, my trainer is Canadian. Both from Toronto, Ontario. So, yeah, they kind of gave me some spots to eat this week, check out, some places to visit like CN Tower.
Yeah, it's pretty funny.
Q. I could tell you said Toronto like a local. We always drop the second T. You did it correctly.
ANNIE PARK: Toronto. What do some people say?
Q. (Indiscernible.)
ANNIE PARK: I was downtown on Sunday, so they had like a lot of festivals going on so we had a lot of food. Just checked out some places and it's really close, closer than you think without the traffic.
I've been to Richmond Hill a couple times. My friend lives in Richmond Hill, so he's been showing us around.
Yeah, I love Toronto. There is a lot of good food.
