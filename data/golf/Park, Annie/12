 Q.  Bogey-free round.  Always a good way to end.  How did you feel walking off the course?  
ANNIE PARK: You know, I left some putts out there, especially 16.  I was not happy about it.   
But you know what?  I made up on 17, and 18 I had a clutch putt.  A lot of clutch putts out there.  Can't really be mad at myself.  Could have been worse; could have been better.  It's just golf.   
So I'm feeling good going into next week.  Hopefully I can keep it going.  I have some good feedback after this tournament, so work on that.   
Can't wait for next week.   
 Q.  You're going to end up just a couple strokes off the lead.  Got pretty close there; Minjee came back a little bit.  Were you watching leaderboards?  Were you pushing at all?  
ANNIE PARK: I did see it on 15 or 14.  You know, I knew par-5 I could have birdied.  There was just so many holes I left out that I'm a little regretful.  I learned my lesson.   
Just moving on.  There is next week.  Hopefully I can work on that.   
 Q.  And just the thoughts on playing back in L.A. close to school.  Not home, but close to your heart.  
ANNIE PARK: Yeah, it's nice.  I have my friends and family here.  Nice to have like that support from home ground.  So it's nice.  Really happy that I'm back.  Be able to eat food where I like to go to.   
Yeah.
