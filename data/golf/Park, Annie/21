Q.   Another win for the U.S., guys, it was a tale of sort of two matches, looked like you had it maybe under control.   I was at the 12th green, very interesting, a no give and then a miss, and yet you held your composure together and came back and won the match. 
    ANNIE PARK:   That was hard.   I was just trying to breathe throughout the next hole.   But we got to back together on 15, and then just tried Tour best from there. 
    ERYNNE LEE:   I mean, it's golf.   We all make mistakes and honestly, I trust Annie. 
    I mean, like for me, obviously with match play, we don't apologize on the golf course but I felt bad on my part because I was thinking about like ramming the putt and making the putt instead of just being a little bit safe with it.   But we know each other's game pretty well.   We know we can get it back together. 

Q.   
    ANNIE PARK:   It was nice to see that we were all pretty much up.   One team was actually a little bit behind but they brought it back together and it was really exciting to watch that and follow it.   So I mean, I'm really proud of the girls and looking forward to tomorrow. 

Q.   What happened on 12? 
    ERYNNE LEE:   Annie hit a perfect shot into the par3, had a nice kick on to the green.   I had like a 15 to 18‑footer maybe, and it was a hard right‑to‑left.   I mean, I felt pretty comfortable with the putt but I was thinking about just like trying to make it so much that it ended up passing by like maybe three feet, and so for her coming back was a little bit tough. 
    ANNIE PARK:   Well, I was putting well throughout the whole morning and afternoon, and I was like‑‑
    ERYNNE LEE:   No biggy.
    ANNIE PARK:   No biggy.   I totally forgot what I had to think about.   That was my mistake but we got it back together.

Q.   You obviously did get back together.   You said 15 was a good moment for you. 
    ANNIE PARK:   14, I was trying to cool myself‑‑ and 15, I hit a good putt.   I just left it short.   I thought it was going to be fast.
    ERYNNE LEE:   Honestly we left a lot out there.   We were hitting good shots and pretty much playing slow and steady golf and they were just making mistakes so we took advantage of it.   I mean, other than that, we are pretty happy with our match today. 

Q.   And USA, you've got, what, four and a half points right now, nice lead, how do you feel as a team? 
    ERYNNE LEE:   Overall, we're deep as a team.   That's what everybody is saying.   I mean, we all have impressive resumÃ©s in match play and just like amateur golf.   So I mean, like we're literally invincible I feel like. 
    ANNIE PARK:   I think all of us, we have this little fire in us, so we always bounce back. 

Q.   You actually lead me to a good question.   Sometimes a comeback is better than a big win; you realize you can come back. 
    ANNIE PARK:   Comebacks are always great if you're leading and then you end up losing the match, that's kind of‑‑
    ERYNNE LEE:   Making a comeback like Alison and Ashlan, we heard they were 2‑down and we actually heard the roar and the crowd go wild like on the 18th hole. 
    So we were really excited for them.   It's hard coming back from behind and it's really worth it by the end of the day.
