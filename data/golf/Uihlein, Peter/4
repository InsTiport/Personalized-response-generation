 Q.  Did you have any idea what you might expect today when you came out?  How would you assess your round out there at 6-under par to start off?  
PETER UIHLEIN: It was solid.  Very good.  I think made a lot of birdies, didn't make bogies.  It was good and pleased with the way -- I felt I drove the ball and did well.  It was nice.   
 Q.  We've seen some very low scores.  Couple of 59 watches.  Was the course getable?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah.  It wasn't necessarily soft especially, the back-9, there was some bounces.  When you have big kind of slopy greens like this where it's sectional, if you're in the right sections you can really kind of be aggressive with putts and not really worry about it getting away from you.   
Seems like they put the pins in some good areas where the ball fed towards the hole and from there you would just pretty much just be aggressive on the greens.  It was definitely good.   
 Q.  Is this round kind of a continuation of the last three holes from Boston?  
PETER UIHLEIN: More or less just kind of last week in Boston.  I came out this week and made a lot of birdies today.  I think it's just kind of a continuation a bit.  Yeah, it's nice kind of playing with free money, really, and kind of out there and seeing what you can do.
