Q. Your thoughts on seven successive birdies out there?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, just keep it going I guess.  I made some pretty dirty birdies on those 17, 18.  Those are really hard holes today.  And then I just thought, you know, I knew that 1 and 2 would be a little bit easier.
I just hit it really well.  Playing nicely and just kind of did the same as I did yesterday.  Just happened to hole a few which was nice.  Yeah, I'm pleased with what happened.
Q. I presume you chuckle to yourself just a little bit and then you see your name rising up that board and suddenly you're involved.
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it was weird, because I was level par going into 15, 1-over for the day and I felt like I played 24 holes really well and I was even par, and I was like, man, I felt like there was going to be a surge coming.  I didn't know it was going to be seven in a row but pleased it was.  Yeah, it's nice to get kind of back in contention.
Q. Fun playing alongside Lucas?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it is.  We played three days in Turkey, as well, the first three rounds.  I enjoy Lucas.  I enjoy his caddie, Todd.  So we have a lot of fun out there.  Yeah, it's mostly laughing and chatter than golf, so it was nice.
Q. And do you need off each other when you're playing well?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I told him on 3 -- 2, when I made another birdie, I was like, man, I was just trying to keep up just so I can try to play with him tomorrow because I enjoy playing with him.
Yeah, I think when you have guys that are kind of feeding off each other, it helps and I was glad to do it, to at least make some birdies to at least push Lucas on a little bit.
