 Q.  You gave it the best you could, really, coming down the stretch.  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I did.  I didn't really look much at the board but when I saw he posted about 12, I think I was 9 at that point on 11.  I just wanted to try and at least make him -- at least make him earn it.  That's all I was trying to do was just put a little pressure on him.  I didn't want him to feel like he could bogey a couple holes and still be okay.   
The only thing I probably would try and redo is maybe be a little bit more aggressive on 15, 16.  But other than that, it was a good shot on 17.  Just a bad tee shot on 18, so I didn't give myself much of a chance.  But other than that, it was a good week.   
 Q.  Fair to say, 18 is a very difficult hole to birdie when you need to birdie.  What was the mind-set when you were stood on the tee?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Just make birdie.  Do whatever you can to try and make a birdie.  With the way the pin was set up in the back left, I didn't feel that it was overly necessary to hit the fairway just because where the pins were yesterday and the day before, you were able to get close.   
But that back left pin, I felt still, if I hit it in the rough and caught a lie, I felt like I could still easily make birdie.  Ball was just a little above my feet and kind of hooked it a little more than I anticipated.  But I gave it a roll with the bunker shot.  It happens.   
 Q.  On the plus side, second place finish in a Rolex Series event and you've got yourself a place at The Open Championship, as well, which is exciting.  
PETER UIHLEIN: It is.  It's a good event to finish runner-up, and yeah, it gets me into The Open and it moves me up The Race to Dubai rankings a little bit.  Any time you finish second in a golf tournament, it's always a good week.
