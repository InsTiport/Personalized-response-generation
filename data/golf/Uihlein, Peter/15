 Q.  An opening 67, how pleasing is that?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it's good.  It was a solid day.  It's nice it get off to a good start.  Pleased where I'm at.   
 Q.  You've played this course a few years ago but there have been quite a lot of changes.  Have they been positive changes in your view?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, they seem to be.  Yeah, I haven't been here since my rookie year four years ago, and yeah, it's totally different.  It's visually much different.  They have gotten rid of a lot of bushes.  The rough's down.  Yeah but it still plays tough.  It's still challenging.  But it does, it looks like a totally different golf course.   
 Q.  To keep bogeys off the card is difficult around this track; not too many people will go bogey-free today.  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, the wind picked up a little bit and it was definitely tricky this morning.  The greens were good, and at times I missed the green I kind of comfortably chipped it really close.  I didn't feel like I had much stress going on today, so it was a nice walk in the park.   
 Q.  Second in the new Rolex Series.  How nice would it be for you to have a good week this week?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it would be good.  Yeah, I've been trending, I've been playing well and my first missed the cut of the year was the U.S. Open.  It's been a good year and it's been solid and steady.  Hopefully I just keep pushing on in the big events and see where I end up.
