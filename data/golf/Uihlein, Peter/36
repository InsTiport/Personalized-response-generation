Q.   Your thoughts on coming so very close?
PETER UIHLEIN:   He earned it the last three holes and hats off to him.   He played great.   It was a tough day and he played fantastic.

Q.   15, 17, they were fun, weren't they?
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, they were cool.   But you can hear the roars in front, you know what you have to do, and like I say, he birdies the last three, fantastic playing.

Q.   A hard day for you, I take it, by and large? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, but at the end of the day, I put myself with a chance.   And going into 15, I made birdie, I think I had a one‑shot lead‑‑ at least I knew he had 18, but I didn't know he birdied 16 and 17.   But what are you going to do?   He played great.   Hats off to him.

Q.   Certainly a chance even over the putt at the last which came mightily close. 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, just made sure I got it up there I guess.
I had a chance, I was in between numbers with the wedges, and had a terrible lie, so I was fortunate to lay up.   Like I say, when he birdies the last three holes, what are you going to do.

Q.   You spoke yesterday about the influence of Jim Furyk and learning your way down the home stretch; do you still feel that way, despite what's happened? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, I wasn't really that sharp today.   I felt like I did all right.   I mean, you know, it was windy and stuff, it wasn't like it was easy out there.   I know SÃ¸ren played great and Bourdy played great, as well, so what are you going to do. 

Q.   And what are you going to do from here on in?   Plenty of lovely tournaments to come?
PETER UIHLEIN:   Going to Switzerland tomorrow, hear it's fantastic, so it should be good.
