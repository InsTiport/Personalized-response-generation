 Q.  Adventurous, wasn't it?  
PETER UIHLEIN: The first seven, eight holes, it was a show.  It was fairway, green, fairway, green and all of a sudden got, just kind of middle of the round, made some nice swings.  But the last few holes was just all over the plot.   
All in all, it was just a day I felt like that's kind of what I would have shot.  Stole a couple shots at the end.  I missed a stretch of holes, I just missed a lot of good looks at birdie.  It is what it is.  I'm not overly disheartened really.   
 Q.  Is it in part down to you or down to the course?  Seems to be playing tougher today.  
PETER UIHLEIN: It's just a good golf course, isn't it.  It's hard.  It's tough to get it close.  I was telling Ben, my caddie, I felt like every time I had a birdie putt, it was like straight downhill, downgrain or cross-grain, downhill.  Felt like I was being defensive, and it's really hard to be aggressive.  And when you have greens this quick and you could be 12, 15 feet, but you're playing a couple feet outside the hole and it's tricky.  It's tough.  Just tough to really get it going.   
 Q.  The overall picture is nice when you see your name on the board into the weekend.  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I think any time -- yeah, tell me at the start, 4-under through two rounds, I'd be pleased.  Look forward to the weekend and see how it goes.   
 Q.  Probably been a while but you've got the appetite for it?  
PETER UIHLEIN: I do.  It was nice to get the blood flowing and the heart beating during the round.  It was nice to get those feelings again.  It's just kind of a building process at this point.
