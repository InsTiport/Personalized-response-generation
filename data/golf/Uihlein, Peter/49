 Q. What was it like playing with those guys?
 PETER UIHLEIN: It was awesome. Phil is obviously an amazing player and so is Geoff. They're both great guys, and it was a good day.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I wish I was behind him on that one to see where he was. That was an unbelievable shot.

 Q. What was maybe one of your best shots of the day? 
 PETER UIHLEIN: I hit a good drive on 1. I killed it. I went through the fairway. And then my pitch-out onto the green was a good shot.

 Q. That shot at 13 maybe? 15? 
 PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, 13 my foot slipped and I left it in the water.

 Q. Never mind that one. Forget that. 
 PETER UIHLEIN: 15 was a really good shot. 

 Q. Did it live up to your expectations?
 PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it exceeded it. This place is unbelievable. You know, the feelings you have out there, it's second to none. It was definitely exciting. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PETER UIHLEIN: He's a great guy. He's obviously an incredibly nice guy, and it was just fun to pick his brain and just talk to him a little bit. And he's an unbelievable player, too. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PETER UIHLEIN: He can do it all. 

 Q. When you say you picked his brain, anything you learned, anything that you'll take away?
 PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I mean, I learned -- especially out here, I was trying to figure out the greens and stuff like that. Yeah, I'll definitely use some of his wisdom out there. 

 Q. Getting off to that fast start had to feel good. 
 PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, good recovery shot on 1 to about 18 feet. I hit two really good shots in 2, pretty good bunker shot on the third. Yeah, obviously a good start. 

 Q. Is there anything in particular you will change about your game plan when you go into tomorrow?
 PETER UIHLEIN: No, I felt my game off the tee was pretty good, and I'm just going to try and execute again tomorrow.
