Q. What are your thoughts on the way this week Las panned out?
PETER UIHLEIN: It was all right.  Played well.  Made a lot of birdies which was nice.  Made a couple of doubles, but yeah, all in all it was a good week.  It was nice.  Brought some form from last week to this week which is good.
Q. You made so many birdies.  It could have been a totally different story had it not been for one or two rogue shots here and there?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, I'm prone to one of them every now and then.  It's been happening.  But yeah, like I said, it's a good week.  I'm pleased that I brought some form from last week to this week.  It's good.
Q. Was it hugely annoying to drop those, or do you still go into today thinking, I have a chance to put it together?
PETER UIHLEIN: Starting the day, I thought 20 was going to be at least a shout.  I don't really know what's in first but I think it's pretty close.  Yeah, the end of the day, I still needed to shoot about 8-under to even get -- try and win.  You've still got to play a really, really good round.  I made six birdies, so I'm not too disappointed.
Q. I take it this is a good sign, as well, if you're carrying on this form from one week to another, there's a lot still to play for in The Final Series.
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, if I'm in.  I'm about 77th to start so I don't know what I'm going to get in.  Hopefully I get into China.
