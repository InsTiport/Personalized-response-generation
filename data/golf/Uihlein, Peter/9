 Q.  69, how was that today?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it was solid.  I didn't feel like I was overly stressed out.  I kind of made a mess of 9 for my only bogey and then made a nice par putt on 12.  Other than that, it was very -- yeah, I didn't feel like I put myself in that many terrible positions where it was like an awesome up-and-down.  So it was okay.   
 Q.  How were conditions out there today?  
PETER UIHLEIN: It was tough.  It's already a tough golf course but yeah, it made it tougher; the way the wind was blowing, it was definitely tricky.   
It's funny, they move tees up on holes where you really didn't need it moved up but then they kept it back on holes that are really, really difficult.  It was kind of bizarre.   
 Q.  Dustin has a massive lead.  What's your game plan for tomorrow?  
PETER UIHLEIN: If it's this windy again, same thing.  Just go out and try to execute shots and just try and be smart and not let things get away from me because it's that kind of golf course where there can be big numbers.  It's that kind of track.
