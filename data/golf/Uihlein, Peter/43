  PETER UIHLEIN:   Only one dropped shot the last two days, and it's been good and excited for tomorrow.

Q.   You've had the fair gamut of weather conditions. 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Everybody is complaining about how hot it was, but coming from Florida, it was hotter there and felt cool to me.   Hopefully the weather will hold off tomorrow, so we'll see.

Q.   Your kind of course? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, I'm very comfortable with the driver right now, so a few holes I can cutoff some corners more than most guys, so I enjoy it.

Q.   I know we must never get ahead of the game, but what are your thoughts on a second win so soon after Madeira? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   I'm just happy to keep putting myself in a good position going into the final round, and that's what it's all about. 
You know, if things happen, great, but if not, I'm back where I want to be and have a chance for tomorrow.

Q.   And essentially you have been putting yourself in those positions; is this the most consistent golf you've played? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Hope so, and I hope it only gets better.   That's the beauty of this game is you can keep improving, so as long as I keep working hard and keep trying to get better, hopefully good things happen.

Q.   What's needed on the final day? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Birdies I guess.   A lot of birdies.   It all depends on the weather, if it's hot and dry and greens firm up, then maybe not but I've heard the weather is supposed to be a little wet tomorrow, so we'll see.
