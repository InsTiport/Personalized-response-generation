Q. Another solid round from you and a fantastic par save on the last.
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it was a good par.  Wasn't a really good finish but it was a good par at least.  It was a good day.  I hit it pretty good.  Made some nice putts I guess.  I was pretty steady, really, so it was all right.
Q. Must have been frustrating when the rains came because you were in a pretty good run at the time?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, actually to be honest, I think when you're putting on poa annua greens and it starts to rain, it actually makes them a lot smoother.  So when the rain came, and they said we could go back out, I figured the greens would be a lot better, and the wind died after the storm.  I figured it actually wasn't the worst time to actually have a little breather.
Q. When you played this course for the first time in practice, did you envisage standing here Friday having dropped just one shot over two rounds?
PETER UIHLEIN: No, because the last time I was out here, I dropped a lot I feel like.  It's just like I said before, it's a totally different golf course.  Yeah, like any time you go 34 holes without a bogey anywhere, you're doing okay.
Q. What's been the biggest positive you can take so far from the two rounds?
PETER UIHLEIN: I've holed a decent amount of putts, which I didn't do at all at the U.S. Open.  So to kind of come, I guess a week and a half later, and start hole some putts and making a few, it takes a lot of pressure off a lot of things.  Makes it a little more comforting.
Q. And these big Rolex events, how nice is it to be going into the weekend in a challenging position?
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it is.  Still have 36 holes left, so you never know.  But I think any time you can kind of get off to, put yourself into contention after two days is where you want to be and see where you're at as the weekend plays out.
