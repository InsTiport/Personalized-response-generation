Q.   Your thoughts on that start? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it's a good start.   Any time you get up near the lead after the first round is always good, and it will be a quick turnaround tomorrow and we'll be ready to go.

Q.   With a score like that, it sounds daft to say it's hard work but it's a tough old track at times?
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it was a grind.   It was a grinds for me, especially where I was putting myself off the tee.   I grinded pretty well out there today, and you know, I'm pleased.

Q.   You're too young to appreciate what it was like seven years ago but I daresay you've heard some of the stories?
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, I would have struggled seven years ago I think.   I'm fortunate enough that the rough is not as penal this week.

Q.   But this is nice to keep things going, isn't it?   We've been speaking regularly and you're getting form week‑to‑week and you're playing with two fellow recent champions?
PETER UIHLEIN:   It was good today.   We fed off each other, Joost had a go and Simon holed some bombs today.   That was cool.   It was a lot of fun. 

Q.   Let me ask about another champion who is doing well on The Challenge Tour, Brooks has done remarkably, hasn't he? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it's fantastic.   I'm fired up with him.   I live with him in West Palm, so it would be nice to have him out here week‑to‑week and be able to stay with him and motivate each other and feed off each other, so it's good. 
We have a good time when we are home, and you know, won't be any different on the road. 

Q.   Is a 62 in you around here? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   I don't know, it all depends on the weather really.   We got pretty fortunate today and the wind kind of laid down a little bit at times and didn't really rain, so we got pretty lucky.   I've heard it's supposed to be windy tomorrow, so we'll see.
