 Q.  How do you reflect on your day's work?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it was good.  It was a good last seven holes.  The rest of it was a bit sloppy.  But it's always nice to finish with a couple birdies.  I'm pleased.  It was a good week's work.   
 Q.  Give me some key moments and things you were doing well.  
PETER UIHLEIN: Scrambling.  I made a nice par on 10 after hitting in a bush.  Got up-and-down on 11.  I made a nice 2-putt par on 12, and after that it was a little bit more smooth sailing, which was nice.  It was a little bit more stress-free coming in, so I guess the par putts on 10,11, 12 were big for me.   
 Q.  How is your game feeling after what was probably a quite frustrating year last year I would suspect?  
PETER UIHLEIN: Yeah, it's off to a nice start.  I feel healthy.  It's the first time I've felt healthy since probably since probably more than a year.  I'm fit, game is sharp and I'm excited to keep it going for next week.
