Q.   I take it that's another satisfying day? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it's a good clean card, always nice around here.   It was good today.   Played really well again, and that's been key.

Q.   Quiet early on and got going to move back up the board?
PETER UIHLEIN:   I had chances early and kind of missed a few.   It was a good, patient day.   I didn't really have‑‑ there was a couple, I guess my last few holes, I kind of ran into par.   But other than that, it was good.   It was solid.   Not really much of a grind.   I had some good looks, so it was good.

Q.   Does it take something to be patient when you know what the leader shot? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it does.   I feel like I've been playing pretty good and I feel like a good round is out there.   Yeah, I just need to be patient like I was, which is nice.   My swing feels good, game is feeling good, and I've been playing this golf course the last couple days pretty well.

Q.   The difference playing afternoon compared to morning? 
PETER UIHLEIN:   Greens are a bit firmer.   Toward the end they definitely had some run‑outs in them, a lot more than I was expecting, and a couple of my chip shots kind of got a way.   The greens get a bit crusty and firm, but it's a great test.   That's the way it should be really.

Q.   And you have to get used to afternoon play from here on in, because you're in a final position, which is all the more nice in the first event of the season?
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, it's right where you want to be and looking forward to the weekend.
