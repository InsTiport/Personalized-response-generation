  PETER UIHLEIN:   Hats off to David, played great, made a nice birdie and congrats to him.  
   
 Q.   You played great yourself?  
PETER UIHLEIN:   He made more putts than I did the end of the day and proud of him and he did great.  
   
 Q.   Proud of your performance at the Old Course this week?   
PETER UIHLEIN:   I just didn't make the putts when I needed to come out and that's the way it is.
