 Q.  Great scoring today and you took advantage of it today.  What do you take away from this?  
PETER UIHLEIN: The pins are all in bowls and some holes, they definitely put an emphasis on moving day, that's for sure.   
 Q.  If you look at your game specifically, what do you feel like you did well?  
PETER UIHLEIN: I felt like if I was out of position, I found the green, took a par and converted nicely, hit some nice shots.   
Yeah, I think it was just kind of a solid day.  I didn't feel like I was ever struggling to make par.  Just felt pretty simple and solid.   
 Q.  As you mentioned, you're already preparing for a tough golf course tomorrow and it's a congested leaderboard.  Nobody is pulling away.  It's anyone's ballgame.  How do you mentally prepare for a final round with the leaderboard the way it is?  
PETER UIHLEIN: I think it's just going to kind of depend on the course setup really.  If they set it up like they did today, which they can do, you're going to have to go really, really low again.  But if they get wind or make some pins tougher, tee boxes back, then a couple under, 4- or 5-under is a good score.  You just have to take what it gives you.
