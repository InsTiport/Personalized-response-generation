 Q.   Verdict on day two?   
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, I'll take it.   I was up all night throwing up from dehydration, so I'll take anything under par today.   I didn't get much sleep and I don't feel that great, so I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   Dehydration; meaning you didn't take enough fluids in yesterday?   
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, started getting a bad headache and anything I ate, I was throwing up.   I was just struggling all night and had a tough time kind of focusing.   I'll take 3â€‘under par.   
   
 Q.   That's unusual for a pro golfer who is in the sunshine all day.   
PETER UIHLEIN:   I'd like to think I'm smarter than that but apparently not.   First time I did this, I was actually about 12 years old in Arizona, so you'd think I learned my lesson, but I haven't, so hopefully I do now.  
   
 Q.   What do you do in these kind of circumstances?   
PETER UIHLEIN:   A lot of Gatorade, a lot of electrolytes, just nibble on food, that's all you can do.  
   
 Q.   Presumably it affects your whole body; your limbs ache.   
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, I was a bit weak on some shots today and I could just tell everything had a little bit of drag.   Now I'm going to rest up and hopefully keep my lunch down.  
   
 Q.   Makes it all the more remarkable to see your name on that board in nice position.   
PETER UIHLEIN:   Yeah, like I said I'll take anything under par today, especially some of the balls I hit out there were a bit entertaining.   I'll take it.   
   
 Q.   What's the trick now?   
PETER UIHLEIN:   Food and fluids and hopefully feel a bit better tomorrow.
