Q. Just as couple thoughts on your round as a whole?MEGAN KHANG: The round was almost perfect.  Front nine and everything was rolling nicely.  I hit a lot of great shots in.  I was able to capitalize, made some putts. The back nine I struggled a bit.  I think I got a little tired and I didn't execute the shots that I wanted to.  I missed them to the wrong spots and you can't do that out here.  Rough is too thick to mess around with.Q. Is the course playing to your expectations?MEGAN KHANG: The course is in amazing shape.  I mean, we got the best conditions in the morning, being in the morning wave.  I feel like it's going to be different in the afternoon.  The course is in great shape.  I couldn't have expected more.Q. How was the crowd for you today?MEGAN KHANG: I love the crowd.  You can get a feel of how you hit the shot based on the crowd.  You know if you hear "yes", you are going, okay, good shot.  Sometimes you hear the "oh" you don't want to hear.  I love the crowd out here.  It definitely gives me some motivation to hit some good shots and get some good feedback.Q. You said your round was almost perfect.  Are there any changes you are going to make for tomorrow?MEGAN KHANG: Miss to the right spots.  The middle of the green is never a bad spot, so I have got to tell myself that instead of being so aggressive ever with some of the pins out here. Other than that, I'll do like I did on the front nine and go shot by shot, hole by hole
