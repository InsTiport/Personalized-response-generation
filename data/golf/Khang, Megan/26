Q. 5-under on the back nine today.
MEGAN KHANG: Yes.
Q. What was working well?
MEGAN KHANG: I mean, it helped that I saw a putt roll in on 11, and then from there on, I just tried to stay patient.  Kurt and I were just trying to make sure we did one shot at a time, rather than thinking ahead and getting ahead of ourselves.
So made birdie on 11 and then 13 through 15 was a really good stretch for me.  Kurt wanted me to play like right at the pin on 13, and I was like, "No, I'm going to go a little left and have the wind push it."  After I hit, it we both look like at each other, gave a look, and it worked out okay.
I think I hit a lot of closer shots on the back nine and gave myself more chances.  On the front nine, kind of struggled with my approach shots, but got it together on the back nine and happy I could capitalize on the putts.
Q. And the eagle on 14?
MEGAN KHANG: The eagle on 14, it's funny because I had less club on 14 than I did on No. 10.  Because like I went from No. 10, having a 3-hybrid in to 14 having a 6-iron in.  I hit my 6-iron really good, and ended up having about a foot and a half, two feet for eagle and I was able to make it.
Q. It looks like you're going to tie your career best finish.  How much motivation does that give you going into the last tournament?
MEGAN KHANG: Yeah, I mean, hopefully I'll tie my best finish before the day's over, and with that, I think it's going to build a lot of confidence going into the last tournament, thinking that, okay, I can play out here when it's blowing.  I'm sure I can do that at CME, and it's probably going to be blowing, too.  But I'm sure Kurt and I will work on it and get our numbers right and play well.
