Q. 5-under today.  Pretty good feeling round.  How was it out there today, other than really, really, really hot.
MEGAN KHANG: I mean, I had a great group.  We had a good group.  A lot of talking in between holes.  I think that definitely helps, being in a good environment, because everyone was complaining about how hot it is.
When you're playing with people you like, I think it helps.
Q. And a lot water I'm sure.
MEGAN KHANG: A lot of the water.  I lost count.  I normally don't drink a ton of water which is probably not good, but I did drink.  I was almost drinking like one a hole.  That definitely helps keep you focused.
Q. Your last hole was No. 9 and you birdied.  Tell me about that.
MEGAN KHANG: So No. 9, I didn't hit the greatest tee shot.  Still in the fairway.  Went from like an 8-iron in the practice round to like a 6-iron.  I had blocked it a little right, so I was just right of the greenside bunker, the right greenside bunker.  I didn't have the best stance or anything and Kurt (phonetic) and I were talking.
We have options.  We can either hit a flop shot or go a little past and have it come back down.  Right before I was about to hit he was like, What are you thinking?  I go, I think I am just going to go for the flop shot.
Really clean; couldn't even see it go in, so I kind of got the reaction off the people.  It was a great way to finish the round.
Q. About how far out was it, do you think?
MEGAN KHANG: It wasn't that far.  Like about pin high from the pin.  A little short of pin high; maybe like 20-yard chip.
Q. You'll take it.
MEGAN KHANG: Yeah, I'll take it.  I wasn't complaining.  I was happy.  Good to finish on a good note.
