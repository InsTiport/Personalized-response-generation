Q. Just talk about your round today.  Describe it.  How do you think it went?MEGAN KHANG: My round was actually going pretty smoothly.  I 3-putted No. 6, the par-3, but then I jumped right back in with a birdie, so that was good. I bogeyed 9, but that was all right because I got an unlucky break.  I hit the shot where I wanted to, it just ran through the green. Going into the back nine, I just wanted to play one shot at a time and another 3-putt came on 11.  I found that water on 12.  After those two hiccups, I bounced back with a birdie, but nothing else came after that.Q. 3-over for the day, 4-over for the tournament, low amateur at this point.  How does that make you feel?MEGAN KHANG: I'm actually a little surprised about that.  I know I saw my friend Muni playing well and I thought she was going to finish well.  It's still a shock and there's still one more day, so we'll see how that goes.Q. What were your goals coming into this week and have you lived up to those goals that you set for yourself?MEGAN KHANG: My initial goal was to make the cut.  It's my third Open and I didn't make the cut the first two times.  I'm glad I accomplished my first goal. And then my second goal right now is to finish low amateur, if not hopefully Top-10, that's going big.  You have to go low tomorrow, but I've got some goals and I still need to accomplish one more tomorrow.Q. Were there any differences you noticed in the course today in terms of setup or difficulty in comparison to the other days?MEGAN KHANG: I knew they moved some tees back and forward a bit.  Other than that, not really.  The course is still in great shape after all the play it's gotten
