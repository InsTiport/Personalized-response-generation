 Q.  A little half point there at the end, you told me you were mad standing on that tee. Why were you so mad in order to get (indiscernible) that shot?  
MEGAN KHANG: Obviously Charley hit it pretty much onto the green on 16 in two, and we both had some lengthy birdie putts. And I was fortunate enough to try and make the putt first, but I left that putt short.   
And on 17 again I had the advantage of going first and just missed it again. And it was kind of fueling my fire, and Charley made hers on 16, so I knew coming into 18 it was all or nothing; just get a half point.   
 Q.  What's the experience been for the Solheim Cup?  
MEGAN KHANG: It's been so much fun. You learn a lot about yourself and about how to play in the wind here. But overall the crowd was great, the team was awesome, and the atmosphere is so fun and so different from everyday golf that we play on tour.
