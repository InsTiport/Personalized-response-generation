 Q.  Pretty good three days for you.  What do you think has been the key to your success this week?  
MEGAN KHANG: I think definitely having it be a new course and everyone is playing at the same level, just trying to stay patient out there and trying to keep it in the fairways, hit greens.  And when it's not, knowing when to miss it in the right spot, and really just trying to take it one shot at a time is what's helped us here.   
 Q.  Do you feel like your game is getting to a good point at the end of the season?  
MEGAN KHANG: I've had a couple rough weeks of Asia, but I think overall it's starting to come together.  It's pretty good to know that it's coming along and hopefully I have a solid three weeks left in me for the off-season.   
 Q.  Do you have any specific goals for the rest of the year?  
MEGAN KHANG: I think definitely give myself opportunities, definitely for tomorrow to go out and post a number just to have a chance out there, and really just kind of play my own game.  Finish well in the Top-10 for the last three or four and just try to play my own game and be confident about it.
