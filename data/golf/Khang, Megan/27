 Q.  Megan, well played today.  Some good birdies on the front nine; came back down to earth on the back nine, but a golf course you really like.  
MEGAN KHANG: Oh, yeah, the golf course is in great shape.  We were lucky enough to play preferred lie today, and just tried to take advantage of it.  Hopefully hit the fairway, that way I could clean my ball.   
But overall, it's a great golf course and I think it really suits my game.   
 Q.  The 9th hole is supposed to be difficult, and you birdied it both days.  
MEGAN KHANG: Well, the first day I was very fortunate to have a great chip in, and I guess that kind of helped me come into today with positive thoughts going into 9.  I was very fortunate enough to hit a 7-iron to about five feet.   
That putt broke a ton, but I was able to read it right, perfect speed, and found the cup.   
 Q.  Your dad must be cheering you on.  
MEGAN KHANG: Definitely.  I think both my parents, they just got back from Florida, so definitely watching the leaderboard if not on the phone on TV.  Hopefully they're watching.  Hi, mom and dad.   
 Q.  If he's not on the golf course.  Didn't your mom, years ago, have to remind him that he had a daughter?  
MEGAN KHANG: Oh, yeah, when my dad first started taking up golf he kind of forgot that I existed.  Thankfully he introduced me to the game, and here we are now.
