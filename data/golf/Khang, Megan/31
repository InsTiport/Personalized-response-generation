 Q.  So you had a great round today.  Looked like you had a really good second nine, which was your front nine.  But tell me how you battled through these conditions today?  
MEGAN KHANG: It really helped to have a really good group out there, Stacy and Sarah, it was fun to play with them.  So I think that definitely helped get this round going.  You play better when you're in good company I think, so that was good.   
But I mean, I was with Kurt, and Kurt and I just tried to stay patient.  Had like a little bump in the road but he just kept telling me to stay patient, and birdies will come, and if not, pars are great.  Even in these conditions, I think it's still a great score.   
 Q.  It looked like you had a lot of those birdies coming in there on your second nine.  Walk us through that.  
MEGAN KHANG: Yeah, so when I made the turn -- I bogeyed 18, so I was kind of disappointed about that, being a par 5.  But I made the turn, and I hit some pretty good shots on 1, 2 and 3, and I was just able to capitalize.   
So I think my putting there helped, and my approach shots definitely were key to those putts going in.   
 Q.  And it's got to feel good to get 18 holes in and not have to stop.  How do you feel overall walking off the golf course?  
MEGAN KHANG: I'm definitely happy to get off the course.  I'm ready to shower even though I feel like I've been in the shower all day.  Shower, get dry, get some sweat pants on and just kind of relax.  Maybe do a few putts.  But other than that, call it a day, because I'm pretty sure the rest of the week looks like this.
