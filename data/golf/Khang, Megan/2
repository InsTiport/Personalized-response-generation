Q. So how did it go out there today?
MEGAN KHANG:   Today was a good day, I mean, given the conditions.  And, I mean, it was actually great to see.  I didn't realize how dry the course got.  It was pretty impeccable how much rain we got yesterday and the maintenance crew did such a good job in the first place and USGA was fair in setting course.
I think once I got past the whole it's going to be cold and windy, it was a good day.  I'm very happy how I played today.  Kurt and I stayed in it the whole day.  Kind of got off track one hole and jumped right back into it.
Q. Tied for fifth.  Qualify for next year at Olympic Club.  What are you most looking forward to?
MEGAN KHANG:   To be honest, I feel like -- we have a tournament at Lake Merced and I know someone who's a member at Olympic Club, and he offers to take us out there.  I was like, No, I want to go there when the Open is there.
So I always tell him I'm holding off for the Open there, so I'm super ecstatic.  I mean, to make sure that we're in the Open again is always an accomplishment, and looking forward to any USGA event.
Q. What was the best part of this week?
MEGAN KHANG:   I mean, I love the USGA.  I've played in USGA events since I was 11 years old in the U.S. Girls.  Just getting to see familiar faces and the challenge of the golf course and the tournament itself, it's always a great feeling, and it really tests all of your game.
