 Q.  It was a frustrating round out there for you, but you did hit the ball beautifully?  
MEGAN KHANG: Yeah, I mean, today, my putter wasn't really hot on the back nine, but I did hit the ball great, so that's one good thing to come away from.  I think you've just got to take the positives in the round and just look on for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How windy is it out on this golf course?  It's a tough layout?  
MEGAN KHANG: Definitely some of the fairways are tight and with it being windy, you've got to try and start it over some rough and just hope that the wind does what it's supposed to do.  Sometimes you don't trust it and sometimes you do.  In the end, you're going to have to, and if you don't, it's going to be a big penalty.   
 Q.  Do you miss not having your dad, Lee, on the bag?  He'd been on the bag all season?  
MEGAN KHANG: I think it's good and bad.  I think my dad and I need some space, but right now it's pretty good.  We talk every day.  My mom and I text; my dad and I text.  We'll call once in a while to check on the swing and everything.   
I think it's good for us and good for the relationship but I do miss him out here.  I wish he was out here with me.  We'll see how it goes without him, and both my parents will be down at CME, so look forward to that.   
 Q.  I'm sure he'll be in touch with you in a couple of days' time, because officially you grew up in a couple of days and become an adult.  No more teenage years left for you.  
MEGAN KHANG: Yeah, no more teenage years.  So I don't know if I can finally say I'm an adult, but I think in their eyes, I'll always be their little baby.  It's not a big deal for me to be the little baby, but I do have to grow up some more and we'll see how that goes.
