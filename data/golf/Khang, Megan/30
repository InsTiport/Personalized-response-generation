MEGAN KHANG: Like back-to-back bogeys on 9 and 10, and was like -- my dad was like, C'mon, Megan.  We got to turn it around here.  Okay, okay, okay.  Like, I know dad.  I know.
So went on a pretty hot run, and thankfully had a good finish.  I'm excited for the weekend, or Friday, Saturday.
Q. What was the key to the turnaround to shoot 8-under today?
MEGAN KHANG: I think I gave myself a lot more chances today.  Yesterday I had trouble finding the green, but today I found the green and I was able to hit some close ones.
Right off the bat, No. 1, I was able to tap in a birdie putt.  I think the key today was giving myself chances and executing the putts.
Q. How much confidence does that give you, you know, first hole you stick it close and just an easy tap-in?
MEGAN KHANG: It definitely got the ball rolling.  I mean, you try -- I try to feed off the momentum off the first hole, so going birdie on the first hole definitely was like, Okay, let's do this, Megan.  It's going to be a good day.
It turned out to be a great day.
Q. Birdie on 12, the par-3, what did you hit there?
MEGAN KHANG: I hit a choke-down 6.  My dad wanted to hit 7, but I was like, Mmm, maybe we'll hit a choke-down 6.  I hit a little baby cut into it and it fed off the backstop a little, so gave myself a good 7-footer.  Yeah, 7-footer for birdie.
Made it, and then just went into attack mode after that.
Q. (Regarding cut line.)
MEGAN KHANG: I saw the leaderboard after No. 9, and didn't help that I went bogey, bogey.  That was in the past and I wasn't going to let that affect me.  I think just trying to think positive and again giving myself chances, because on this golf course you have to be able to give yourself chances.
