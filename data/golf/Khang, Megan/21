 Q.  11-under total through round 2 here in Portland, 7-under for the day, firing an eagle on the par-5 fifth.  What was going on out there today?  
MEGAN KHANG: My caddie and I just kind of hit some great shots, had some good numbers, and just kind of stayed patient out there.  Definitely gave myself a lot of opportunities, and luckily a few of them dropped, and just kind of kept that mentality for the rest of the day.  Didn't try to get ahead of myself, and we just kind of bantered back and forth about other things than golf.   
 Q.  One of your top 10s was here last year; seems like you really like this golf course.  Can you talk about the course conditions and why this course suits your game?  
MEGAN KHANG: Well, it's good to remind myself that I finished top 10 here.  I didn't remember that.  But I think just being out here in the Northwest, it kind of reminds me of being at home with the whole tree line and the same kind of grass.  I think that kind of aspect definitely helps me play out here.  And I think that being said, I can just play my own game, just like I do back home.   
 Q.  Are you a player that tends to look at the leaderboard during the round, and how confident were you when you saw your name up at the top?  
MEGAN KHANG: I try not to look at the leaderboard because I can't really help what other people do.  If I just play my own game and just stick to what Kurt and I have been doing all day, then it normally ends up in our favor.  But I took a peek here and there, but overall just tried to stay in my own zone.   
 Q.  How are you feeling going into the weekend seeing your name at the top with some of the best players out here?  
MEGAN KHANG: It's definitely a great feeling.  I know that the afternoon wave still has to go off, so I've just got to get a little practice in and prepare myself for the weekend going with the same mentality that I have the last two days.   
 Q.  How have you been enjoying your time here in Portland?  
MEGAN KHANG: Oh, definitely.  The food is great, people are great, and I did some shopping while we were here.  So I think it's going to be a great week.  Already is.  I can't wait for the weekend.
