  MEGAN KHANG:   It's just nice to finish on a Sunday with a bogey-free round.  It's always nice to have a bogey-free round.  But especially on a Sunday.
 Q. Any of the five birdies stand out?  8, 9, 11, 16, and 18?
 MEGAN KHANG:   Honestly, I would have to say 8.  If anyone saw my scorecard yesterday I had a whole debacle on 8.  Yeah, I was four strokes better today on that hole, like three strokes better in putting.  So 8 definitely stood out.  I walked off 8 going, Hey, that's four shots right there.  (Laughter.)
 Q. You and Jay were watching the action on Golf Channel in the scoring tent.  What was it like to look up and see what Lydia is doing?
 MEGAN KHANG:   I mean, I don't know about Jay, but I was watching the scoreboard.  Any time you saw the scoreboard I saw Lydia's name up there and I was like, Oh, what did she start at?  Like everyone knew Patty is playing this golf course so well, and for Lydia to be lighting it up on a Sunday just shows how exciting this finish is going to be.
 Like whoever wins in the end is really going to have to work for it and they really earned it.
 Q. Did they do justice then for 18, taking the grandstand out for a finish that we could be anticipating?
 MEGAN KHANG:   I personally really do like the 18th this way.  I mean, I was very tempted to go for it today, but obviously with no backstop it let a lot of different things into play, so I opted to lay up.
 I know both girls have the power to get it there.  If one does have to come down to eagling the last and they have to go for it, I mean, it puts in a lot more thought around the second shot going in.
 Q. How much can you use today's strong final round performance in a major championship?  How much can you use that in a couple weeks, months, just to look back and reflect on what you were able to accomplish?
 MEGAN KHANG:   I mean, it's always a confidence booster finishing well at a major, and just I'm taking away a lot of positives this week in the sense of my game is where it needs to be.  Always constantly work with my dad.  I'm going to go back home, work on a few things, tell him what I think I need to work on and obviously he's going to tell me what he thinks I need to work on.
 Overall I'm very happy with how things are coming together, and slowly but surely we'll get it all timed perfectly and hopefully get that first win.
 Q. What are some plans you have for the down week before Hawaii?
 MEGAN KHANG:   So I'm actually not playing Hawaii.  I have two weeks at home.  I mean, I got to go back cross country, so probably take a day off and just kind of really analyze how I played these two weeks, just kind of keep relaying it back to my dad, and always working on the swing.
 Q. Any Masters pick?
 MEGAN KHANG:   Any Masters pick?  I actually don't know.  I mean, I kind of want to pick Jordan with how hot he's playing.
 Q. He won today.
 MEGAN KHANG:   I mean, he's knocking on the door pretty much seems like every week.
 Q. Yeah, he won today.
 MEGAN KHANG:   He won today?
 Q. Yeah.
 MEGAN KHANG:   So he's got the momentum going in.  Always been a big Jordan fan.  So for me it's between Jordan and Rory.  I want Rory to get that first green jacket.
 Q. I think a lot of people do, too.  You're the first one to say Jordan.
 MEGAN KHANG:   He's playing so hot right now.
 Q. When you win coming into a major, that has to give you some good confidence.
 MEGAN KHANG:   Especially a course he loves.
