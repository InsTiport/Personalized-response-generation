 Q.  Going low here on day two in Naples.  Low round of the day going so far, 67.  How would you describe the round today?  
MEGHAN KHANG: Definitely was a great start to go off with a birdie.  Little bump in the road, but then didn't stop us.  Had my caddie just telling me to stay patient out there and give myself opportunities, and that's what we did and we were able to capitalize on a lot of those good shots we hit.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you had to go out there and post a low number after seeing the crazy numbers people were posting on day one?  
MEGHAN KHANG: I definitely thought so.  I mean, with Amy shooting 9-under the first round, it's like she was playing a different golf course than I was.   
Definitely I knew my game was there.  Just kind of, again, had to stay patient and put a good round and see where that puts me at the end of the day.   
 Q.  This is your third time playing here in this event.  What are your thoughts on this course and how it sets up for you and your game?  
MEGHAN KHANG: I definitely think this course is in great shape just to start off.  Overall this course suits my game very well.  Got some par-5s where you can be aggressive with, and sometimes you might have to lay back once in while.   
Overall it's a great track and it challenges all of us.   
 Q.  Just a few back now heading into the weekend.  What's the game plan?  Try and stay aggressive?  
MEGHAN KHANG: Definitely try and stay aggressive.  See, again, where it is at the end of the day.  Just play my own game and not really try to force things and just let it happen.
