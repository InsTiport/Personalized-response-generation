  Q. Could you just tell us a little bit about how your round went today?
 MEGAN KHANG:   As I was telling my caddie, I didn't feel like I played bad.  Obviously got a few unlucky breaks with the mud out there, but overall I was happy with how I was striking it.
 I mean, to be in the second to the last group on a Saturday, it's always nerve wracking, and I think I handed it pretty well.  Just gave myself some chances when I had an opportunity, and just got to get some more putts drop.
 Q. How was Cypress playing today versus the first two rounds?
 MEGAN KHANG:   It was definitely longer.  The rain we got yesterday definitely made the course a little longer.  It's always a challenge, but it's the same distance for everyone else and you just have to accept it and move on and that way you can play your own game.
 Q. So we're going to have a little weather tomorrow.  You're currently in the Top 5.  What number is in your mind that you're going to want to target tomorrow?
 MEGAN KHANG:   Honestly, I don't want to put any expectation on myself.  I just want to go out there, kind of keep the same mindset.  It's going to be a tough day given the conditions, and as long as I go in there playing my own game, I don't want put a number out there, but if I play well, I think a lot of it will come together at the end.
