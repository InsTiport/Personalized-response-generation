Q. 4-under round.  How happy are you with that score today?
MEGAN KHANG: Good question.  I'm very happy with the score today.  I think conditions were a little better than yesterday given we didn't have to worry so much about the weather.
Other than that, they're setting the course up very tough in certain places, but they have a little give and take.
Overall, happy to get a little round under par.
Q. How was it playing different today, to course?
MEGAN KHANG: Definitely a little softer today.  You were at a disadvantage if you hit it into the rough or even the second cut because there were a bunch of mud balls out there, and I got one.
Got to look at the bright side.  Still managed to keep to go and tried to not let it bother me so much.
Q. Where were you when the weather delay happened yesterday?
MEGAN KHANG: I was very fortunate.  I was in the morning wave, so I was back at hotel.
Q. Awesome.  So strategy going into tomorrow's round?
MEGAN KHANG: Not really anything different.  Just kind of keeping my head in the moment and just kind of playing my own game.  More so just enjoying it.  I mean, you can always look at the water and just think, We're in France.
Q. Coming into the week what were you thinking of like as your goal?  What were you trying to attain this week?
MEGAN KHANG: Honestly my game has been pretty strong right now.  I'm pretty happy with my ball striking at the moment, and I knew if I got a few putts to drop it can be my week.
Overall just trying to get to finish at No. 1, but either way give it my best, and then wherever that ends up, it's good takeaway.
