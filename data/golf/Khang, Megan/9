Q. What's it like it get a hole-in-one?
MEGAN KHANG: Honestly, it was so cool. It was my first one as a professional in a tournament, so it was pretty cool.
I knew I hit a good shot and it was just kind of online, and the fact that I' watched it, it was like, Go in; do it. I was like, Yeah, looks good, and went it. It was just exhilarating to see it go in. Sometimes you don't get to see the ball go in, so it's pretty cool.
Q. Did it, I'm guessing, bounce, roll in -- unfortunately it wasn't on camera, so I didn't see it either.
MEGAN KHANG: No, it was funny, because like the camera guy came like right as went to go pick up the ball out of the hole.
But, no, it landed like perfectly. It landed right over -- just onto the green like we planned it, and kind of rolled in like a putt.
So it was perfect line, perfect speed.
Q. Perfect line, perfect speed. Pretty perfect round for you: 8-under, 64, ties your career low round, at least out here an tour. What got into you today?
MEGAN KHANG: I mean, honestly, it was just kind of stay patient today. There were some things that happened that kind of lightened the mood. I'm not going to share -- I'll tell you after, but it's funny. It's really funny. Just kind of stayed patient out there. Kurt and I were just going, Look, we're hitting it well, putting well, just kind of keep going.
I think I was 3-under making turn and then the hole-in-one happened and we just kind of like hit a high and. We were like, Okay, we still have to calm down. We have like seven more holes left, or six more holes left.
Just kind of one of those days where you just stay patient, rolled some in, rolled some long ones in, and just kind of had fun out there. Great group to be with.
