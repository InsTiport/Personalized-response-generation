Q. You're two strokes line the leader and you've won events before.   What's the pressure like?
MIRIM LEE:   Truthfully in the morning, I felt a little bit of pressure but then as I started playing, it went really well.  So then I just played comfortably.
Q. You're obviously great under pressure.  What are you telling yourself throughout the day?
MIRIM LEE:   Although there were some mistakes, I feel like at the end of the day, I played a really great round.
Q. What are you looking forward to for tomorrow, Poppy's Pond in mind?
MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, some of the putting could have been a little bit better, but I'll focus on the putting for tomorrow.
Q. So what will make you relax and ready to go for tomorrow?
MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, feeling a bit under pressure, I like feeling a little bit under pressure so I think tomorrow if I have a little bit of that, it will be good
