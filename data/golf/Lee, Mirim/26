Q. Definitely a little bit of weather conditions today.  Just overall how the golf course is playing?
MIRIM LEE: As the weather is cold then it help I hit driver.  I hit really good today.  So today I thought -- it was good today.
Q. What do you think has been the key to success for your first two rounds?
MIRIM LEE: I think keep the driver, fairway.  That is the biggest.
Q. How hard is it with this golf course being so narrow and tight to trust that shot, especially with the driver?
MIRIM LEE: Oh, last two week I hit really not uncomfortable feels, but now it's getting better.  I trust it, yes.
Q. Trust is definitely a good thing on this golf course.  Congratulations, best of luck this weekend.
MIRIM LEE: Thank you.
Q. A new caddie?
MIRIM LEE: Yes.
Q. When did you guys start?
MIRIM LEE: This week.
Q. What happened to the other one?
MIRIM LEE: First time.
Q. How did you guys meet?
MIRIM LEE: Amy's caddie --
Q. Amy Yang?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. Obviously it's working pretty well?
MIRIM LEE: He's nice.  He's good.
Q. What is his name?
MIRIM LEE: Darren.
Q. So you're coming off a missed cut?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. What happened there?  What have you changed since then?
MIRIM LEE: I just changed the mind coach.
Q. Changed coach, changed caddies?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  Because my shot feels really bad, so I need something changed.
Q. Something different?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  So I practice hard.  Now is getting really better.  So I keep hit the driver in the fairway.
Q. Weren't you with Bryan Lebedevitch?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  But now is -- Tony --
Q. Amy's coach?  Tony.  We'll find out his last name.  What has Tony told you that has worked?
MIRIM LEE: My problem is like driver -- but I try fade.  But really simpler.  Some coaches say aim left, then close, and then keep -- just Tony say just keep same -- and leave the face open and just hit.
Q. So just a little bit of change?
MIRIM LEE: Just a little aim, but feel.  So very easy.  Simple.
Q. A huge difference?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. So the worst was your driver before, no accuracy?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  My sister said, really, you're so different.
Q. What is her name?
MIRIM LEE: Heun, H-e-u-n.
Q. Does she travel with you every week?
MIRIM LEE: Yes.
Q. What's going on with your taped thumb?
MIRIM LEE: My thumb is a little hurt, but now is okay.  If grass is a little hard it hurts.  Here is not too hard, and is fine.
Q. What about this golf course?  What do you think of this golf course?
MIRIM LEE: Really perfect.  And then really difficult.  Really narrow, right?  Rough is tall.  Greens are fast.  But fun.
Q. What was fun about it?
MIRIM LEE: Just hit like beautiful course and here.
Q. So pretty?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. Have you played a course like this before?
MIRIM LEE: No, this week first time.
Q. With that many trees?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, a lot.
Q. Seems like the kind of golf course if you're on, you could really separate yourself from other people.  If you're not you can really get in trouble.  Can you see where there could be really big differences in playing here?  How much can you separate yourself -- if you play a little bit better than others, can you go really high up the leaderboard, do you think?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, I think so, because if hit the driver center and then just hit -- some holes they long, but some holes, like 7- or 8-irons, so maybe a lot of chance.  So I think so.
Q. You think there's a lot of birdie chances out there?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  I had a lot today, but just missed putt, misread.
Q. Your last win was 2014 Reignwood?
MIRIM LEE: Right.
Q. Did you put pressure on yourself to win again?  Did that lead to your coach change?
MIRIM LEE: I just play and fun and enjoy.  Not really pressure, just okay.
Q. Have you changed your game plan coming into majors at all?  Do you treat it the same or do you treat them differently?
MIRIM LEE: I think the same, just try same feel and then just try same like first, second round.
Q. What do you think of the design as far as the way trees can even block you into the fairway?
MIRIM LEE: I don't like it.  I would cut --
Q. You want to cut the trees?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. With a chain saw and cut them down?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, like at nighttime.  I couldn't.
Q. If there's fallen trees tomorrow, we know it's you.  We're coming for you (laughter.)
MIRIM LEE: That's good.
Q. How many practice rounds did you play?
MIRIM LEE: How many?  I arrive in Sunday afternoon, and then Monday 18-hole and then Tuesday just nine hole, from nine hole, that's it.
Q. Is that what you usually do?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
Q. In your yardage book do you have a lot of notes, hit it here, hit it here?
MIRIM LEE: No, not really.  I just -- he show me and then just I read.
