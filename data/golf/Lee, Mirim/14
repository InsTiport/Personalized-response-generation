 Q.  You had four bogeys but five birdies.  Tell us about your round today.  
MIRIM LEE: Today it's a little challenge.  My driver is a little -- it's a problem.  But I came back, and yeah, it's fine.   
 Q.  Your first nine was where most of the bogeys happened.  What did you tell yourself to get yourself more confident and motivated?  
MIRIM LEE: I just said, I want to go home  -- just kidding.  I'm trying to -- the front nine, the driver is bad, so I'm trying to like more consistent hit driver on the back nine.  That's it.  Just thinking --   
 Q.  Even though you had some struggles with your driver today, you still shot a really great score.  You're at the top of the leaderboard.  What are you hoping to do to prepare for tomorrow?  
MIRIM LEE: Maybe I practice a little more drivers.  Still irons good, so I had lots of chances, then putting was just okay today, so maybe I practice a little more.  Yeah, that's it.
