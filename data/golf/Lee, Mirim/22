 Q.  5-under today; what was the key to your round out there?  
MIRIM LEE: Today everything was good.  Just one missed shot with the driver, but it's fine, yeah.   
 Q.  How tough was it, you're playing really well, then you have a three-hour weather delay and you have to go back out.  How tough is that mentally to overcome?  
MIRIM LEE: It's not really tough, but just like I try to keep focused on the course and my shots.  Yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  You had the three-week break on the schedule between Ricoh and now.  What did you do during those three weeks?  
MIRIM LEE: I rest one week, and then I practiced a little bit, a little bit, and then -- yeah, I hit a little bit and then I work out.   
 Q.  Were you back home in Korea?  
MIRIM LEE: No, I stayed in Dallas.   
 Q.  What did you do for the three hours during the delay today?  
MIRIM LEE: I was talking to my friends and then my sister, and then eating.   
 Q.  When you came back, that's when you got a bogey, but you answered right back with a birdie?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, the bogey was just -- after the delay -- before the delay, I hit a missed shot, and then just par putt and then five yards, so I didn't make.   
 Q.  So the putt was the first thing when you came back out?  
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, uh-huh.   
 Q.  How nice was it to bounce back with a birdie on the next hole?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, right.  I hit 8-iron a little past that pin, but I made.  It's four yards.   
 Q.  How do you like this course?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, this course was perfect, and then the greens are really fast.  I'm a little bit worried, and then -- but now is okay.  The score is good.   
 Q.  How badly did you want the putt on 18 to get back into the lead?  You made a nice approach shot and had a really good putt there.  
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.
