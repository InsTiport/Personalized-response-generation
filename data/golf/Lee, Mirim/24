Q. You had a really good stretch on the front nine, and then the back nine, what happened, first, on 10?
MIRIM LEE: I think today course was tough, like too much windy.  And so I keep trying to like hit the fairway and the green, but I couldn't.  So score, it's not bad, but not good, too.
Q. Do you feel good about the position you're in?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, I like it.
Q. How important was the birdie on 15 after having the rough holes before?
MIRIM LEE: I don't know, I just keep trying to like hit par, par.  So, I don't know, I have no idea now.  And I'm hungry now, so I want to go home.
Q. This is a new situation for you, something you haven't done before where you're in contention at the U.S. Women's Open.  How do you face that?
MIRIM LEE: I don't know.  I feel just good now.  Just fun today.  I was fun today, and then I try to fun -- I play to fun tomorrow, yeah.
Q. Was the wind a big factor out there compared to the morning yesterday?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, it was really tough today.  The greens were a little slow but a little firm, too.  So it was tough today.
Q. Do you feel like you have to shoot under par tomorrow?
MIRIM LEE: I try.  I do.  I do, yeah.
