Q.   So 10‑under round today, what was the best part to your game? 
MIRIM LEE:   I think my irons.   Irons was very good, so I have a lot of chance, so play good.   Play was good. 

Q.   The golf course today, it's been putting some low scores.   What was the difference in the golf course today for you to shoot 10‑under compared to even par yesterday? 
MIRIM LEE:   In Thailand, it's always windy but today it's no wind.   So I think the course is easier. 

Q.   Yesterday you shot 72 and today 62. 
MIRIM LEE:   Iron was good but putting was no good.   Two bad drives yesterday.

Q.   And today you hit all fairways?
MIRIM LEE:   Not all the fairways, but like yesterday, we had two penalty shots, so looking at four‑ or five‑shots there. 

Q.   And this is your rookie season on the LPGA Tour.   How has the experience been for you? You've already won twice and you're having a heck of a year?
MIRIM LEE:   I'm so excited.   I always enjoy the play, so I'm very happy, yeah.
