 Q.  How did you feel coming into today?  Did you feel good about playing here?  
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, I feel not uncomfortable, like long game.  But short game was good.   
 Q.  What made you feel uncomfortable here?  
MIRIM LEE: Swing feels no good, right now but scoring well.   
 Q.  What about the swing, what's going on?  
MIRIM LEE: I have no idea.  I just try straight, straight, straight.   
DYLAN VALLEQUETE (Caddie):  Little change this winter, kind of got things a little off.  Just trying to get back to playing how she was before.  Probably made a change for the better, but kind of got her off a little bit.   
 Q.  What was the change?  
MIRIM LEE: I don't want to think.   
 Q.  Great position, you have to feel very good going into the weekend.  
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, I just try, just straight, straight, straight and then make, make, make.   
DYLAN VALLEQUETE: No expectations.  Trying to manage the game.   
MIRIM LEE: No more think.  Just hit.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, anything you want to change out of today?  
MIRIM LEE: Same as today.   
 Q.  How good is a bogey-free round on this course?  You have to be pleased with that.  
DYLAN VALLEQUETE: It's windy, it's good.  Short game has been good.   
MIRIM LEE: I think hitting is no good, so short game was better.   
DYLAN VALLEQUETE: The greens, was able to get it on the green somewhere.   
 Q.  How long were the putts on your birdies?  
DYLAN VALLEQUETE: Good par putt on 2.  Way left and putted almost off the green, six yards.   
The par 5s, hit it on the green in two.  Birdied 12 from just in front of the green.  Chipped up close.   
18 was a bunker shot.  Hit a great shot on 13 with a 4-iron.  Hit a great shot there.  4-iron, 193 yards, six feet.
