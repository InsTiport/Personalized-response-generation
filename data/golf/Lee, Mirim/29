Q. You're one behind, and a good birdie at the last.  Describe what happened on the last hole?

Q. What changed in your game this week?
MIRIM LEE: I think long game was better.  So this week is -- this week is better than last week.
Q. What is it like to be home in Korea, playing in front of a lot of people?
