Q. You hit it so very well all week, especially today.  At any point today, Mirim, were you nervous?
MIRIM LEE: Yes, I was little nervous, but I made.  (Laughter.)
Q. Two years ago you lead going into the final round.  What was different this week?
MIRIM LEE: I think it's hitting was little better than like two years ago.  Yeah, that's it.  (Laughter.)
Q. Impressive to watch.  See you again next week.
MIRIM LEE: Thanks so much.
