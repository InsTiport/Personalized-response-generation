Q.   Great round today.   Three consecutive birdies, 14, 15, 16.   What was working well for you? 
    MIRIM LEE:   Nothing was perfect.   Nothing worked particularly well, but I was able to consistently hit my shots.   13, 14, 15, short holes.   I was able to pitch it in and use my putter to make it work. 

Q.   Bogeyâ€‘free round.   How did you avoid mistakes on this course? 
    MIRIM LEE:   I really focused on hitting greens and not missing the greens.   I don't think I gave myself opportunities to make bogeys, so I was pretty consistent.
    Overall, it was a pretty comfortable round. 

Q.   And then overall impressions of this course, this resort? 
    MIRIM LEE:   As you know, this is my first year on the LPGA and obviously the first time participating in the fall Asian swing. 
    My general impression of the golf course is it's a pretty good golf course and everything is very nice.   The resort is nice.
    I'm hoping I can make it back here again next year.

Q.   You mentioned this is your first year on the tour.   With one win already, pretty successful rookie year.   Happy with it so far? 
    MIRIM LEE:   I think having a win definitely makes this a good year. 
    But with that said, I had a lot of ups and downs this year. 
    So it's a pretty good year, but not necessarily the best that I could do.

Q.   Will a win here make to a good year? 
    MIRIM LEE:   What do you think?   Of course.   (Laughter.)
