Q. Coming in second place in a major, tell me about the week.
MIRIM LEE: You know, overall it was very fun.  I had a 10-under week.  You can't complain about that.  It was really fun overall.
Q. Any other positives you can take from leading for three days?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, you know, not all the shots went my way, but like you said, having gone through the lead for the three days, I take a lot of positives out of that, yeah.
Q. So was there one thing you did particularly well to get yourself in this position; going back to leading for so long, mentally, that's quite draining.
MIRIM LEE: I really had fun.  That was the most important thing, I had fun throughout the whole thing.
Q. And the RICOH Women's British Open is your favourite tournament now?
MIRIM LEE: Yeah, I think it's going to be like that, yeah.
