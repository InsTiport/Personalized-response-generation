Q.   Another good round for you.   How are you feeling overall today? 
    MIRIM LEE:   Just like yesterday, I focused on getting my ball to the greens.   In the middle I think it wasn't working so well, but overall it was okay.   Very similar to yesterday.

Q.   You had a bogey on 16, was it?   What did you do on 18?   It didn't update.   What did you do to rebound? 
    MIRIM LEE:   I really went for a birdie on 16, but pin placement was very difficult.
    And then the distance I had was a bit of a difficult one for me, so I made a mistake.   I think I just had a missâ€‘shot.

Q.   And then rain delay, what did you do during?   And after did you feel like it affected your play at all? 
    MIRIM LEE:   You know, right before I left I had about a birdie putt for about one meter.   So we went in and I had food because I was hungry.   I think that didn't really serve me well.
    I think it had a little bit of a negative affect and that turned me to what happened on 16.

Q.   What will you do today in preparation for tomorrow? 
    MIRIM LEE:   I think I just need to work on my putting and shots.   I will go practice a little bit.   Looking for a good result tomorrow, so go practice and get some good rest tonight.
