  Q. Compared to yesterday, how do you feel?
 MIRIM LEE:   Truthfully not a lot has changed, but the swing has changed a bit.  It was nice -- compared to some rounds I didn't miss a lot of shots, but I still did miss some shots, so I look forward to the next couple rounds.
 Q. Do you have something that you'd like to tell yourself to get ready mentally?
 MIRIM LEE:   I would tell myself, you're doing great.  Round 3, let's go.  It feels so good to be back and playing competitively.  I was in Korea during the pandemic, during the quarantine, and it feels really good to be back and playing.
 Q. How was it to play with Mi Hyang Lee who also speaks Korean?
 MIRIM LEE:   I felt really comfortable playing with her, and Mi Hyang's personality is also really fun and great.  Overall it was just a lot of fun.
