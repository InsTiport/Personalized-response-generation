Q. What was your round like today?
MIRIM LEE: I did lots of good tee shots today, so I felt comfortable with iron shots. This helped me make great opportunities.
Q. How do you feel about your game right now?
MIRIM LEE: I donât have any kind of pressure yet. I feel good and comfortable now.
Q. Do you have anything you want to accomplish throughout the end of the year?
MIRIM LEE: My goal now is to develop my shots. My shots have not been so great this year. Luckily, itâs getting better and better. I feel good about it.
Q. Whatâs your strategy on this golf course?
MIRIM LEE: I think tee shots are very important, especially for this kind of soft course. Once the ball got into the rough, it got so muddy.
