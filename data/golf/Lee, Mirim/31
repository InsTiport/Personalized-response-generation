Q.   Maybe yardages or anything.   So what was the best part today?   Putting?
MIRIM LEE:   Today was putting.

Q.   Putting. 
MIRIM LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   How many‑‑ we had a lot of long putts, short putts?
MIRIM LEE:   Two, yeah.   15 yards.   One was 15 yards.   40 feet, two 40‑footers.

Q.   Where were they?
MIRIM LEE:   No. 8 and 7; right?   No. 16 and 17. 
CADDIE DYLAN:   Then just hit a lot of solid shots, then hit a lot of greens. 
MIRIM LEE:   Well, feel no good today.
CADDIE DYLAN:   Long game didn't feel good.   Swing didn't feel good.   Made a lot of putts.

Q.   Have you putted that well?   Is that the best you've putted?
MIRIM LEE:   I think so.
CADDIE DYLAN:   Last week we struggled.   Couldn't make anything last week.   And so.
MIRIM LEE:   I practiced a lot this week. 

Q.   What did you practice on?   Alignment?   Grip, anything?
CADDIE DYLAN:   Changed the grip.
MIRIM LEE:   I changed the grip. 

Q.   Okay.   To what?
CADDIE DYLAN:   A little more up in the hand, more in the Palm, so less face rotation.

Q.   Okay.   Made the difference.   All right.   Any holes that stuck out?   Any momentum holes?   Anything that changed?
MIRIM LEE:   No. 2. 
CADDIE DYLAN:   No. 2?   The two‑putt, par‑3 on the right side, on the course, just making par on No. 2.   Because we were long through the green on 2.   And had a really difficult pitch or chip shot. 
And hit it down there to three feet and made the putt.   Yeah.   It was really good up and down. 

Q.   Okay.   Did you play here last year?
MIRIM LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   Okay.   How did you play?
MIRIM LEE:   I think not that good last year.

Q.   Much better so far.   What did you expect coming in to this week?   I know this course is tough?
CADDIE DYLAN:   Well, after last week.   (Laughs).   We didn't really have good feelings about the course because from last year.   And we didn't putt very well last week.   So just felt like‑‑
MIRIM LEE:   Improve the putting here. 

Q.   Just improve the putting.   And it worked?
CADDIE DYLAN:   So the expectations weren't really high.   But she had a good attitude, wasn't too down after last week.   So stayed positive and thought this week could be good.   Last week was just a bad week. 

Q.   Just put it behind you. 
CADDIE DYLAN:   Yeah.   Exactly.
