 Q.  Overall, feeling a little frustrated?  
MIRIM LEE: A lot of hit bad shots today, but still there.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your position going into tomorrow?  You're still right in the hunt.  
MIRIM LEE: I'm good.  I'm okay, yeah.   
 Q.  What worked today?  Clearly it was still a solid round.  What was the best part about your game?  
MIRIM LEE: Some good putts, but that's it.  Difficult.   
 Q.  Couple long ones?  
MIRIM LEE: Almost 40 yards.  2-putt from the front, No. 12.   
No. 3 is a long putt.  Couple good par putts on 16 and 17.  That's it.
