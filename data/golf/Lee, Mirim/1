  Q. Mirim, what are some of your thoughts after the third round today?
 MIRIM LEE:   It just tough today.  Weather is little hotter than yesterday and then course was difficult today.  It's windy and then little firmer than yesterday.
 So, yeah, but I made good score today.
 Q. Do you think about those feelings of winning last year when you're on the course?
 MIRIM LEE:   Not really.  I just play like -- I practice a little bit yesterday because my swing is a little not good, so I just thinking like little swing and then, yeah, that's it.
 Q. I was going to say, you told me yesterday that you were working on your swing.
 MIRIM LEE:   Yeah, right.
 Q. Does it feel better?
 MIRIM LEE:   It's way better.  Today I play like a little easier than yesterday.  Just hit it.  So I like, yeah.
 Q. What would it mean to have a top finish here tomorrow?
 MIRIM LEE:   I don't know.  Just play like today and then keep going, make lots of birdie maybe.  (Laughter.)
