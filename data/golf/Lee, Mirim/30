Q.   So it's the putting this week has been the best has been the theme of everything?
MIRIM LEE:   Yeah, playing better.

Q.   Any long putts?

Q.   And then we missed 18.   What did you do there? 
DYLAN VALLEQUETE:   Hit it in the left rough and then had 165, and hit a good 5‑iron, and then that landed about five short of the green and then two‑putted.
