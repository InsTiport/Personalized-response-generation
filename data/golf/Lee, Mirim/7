  Q. Are you in disbelief right now?
 MIRIM LEE:   Yes.  I can't believe it.
 Q. What were the emotions like when you got into that playoff?  What were you telling yourself?  I'm sure that it had to be a little bit of a surprise to you for most of the day.
 MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, I had no emotions, I just told myself, let's just finish this quickly.
 Q. You were talking to some friends back home in Korea waiting to see if you would get into the playoff.  What did they tell you?
 MIRIM LEE:   My friends said encouraging words, a lot of words of encouragement, and said do your best, win, and come back home.
 Q. How did you feel about the chip-in on 18 in regulation?
 MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, I had no -- I didn't have too many thoughts, I just wanted to birdie the hole, and then I ended up chipping in, and it felt great.
 Q. Winning your first major, how did you feel?
 MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, it might be hard to believe, but I just didn't think of this as too big of a deal.  I just thought about my parents and my family, and it would be cool to win, but I didn't really have any special thoughts because it was a major.
 Q. The jump into Poppies Pond, how special was that?
 MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, it felt like -- I was kind of scared and intimidated to jump in Poppies Pond, and then did I win -- thoughts kept coming back, and then yeah, I was scared to jump into Poppies Pond.
