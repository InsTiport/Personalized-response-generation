 Q.   Holy smokes, congratulations.   Big win for you.   You played so well.   Tell me how you feel right now.   
    MIRIM LEE:   I really didn't think I would get my second win this quickly.   I was a lot more nervous this time than first time around.   I think I made a few mistakes towards the end, especially on the 18th.  
    I'm really happy I won the tournament, and it was good.  
   
 Q.   The other day you said your second win would make your rookie year good.   How do you feel about that now?   Is this a good rookie year?   
    MIRIM LEE:   It is now.   But as you know, we've got seven more tournaments to go.   So I don't want say it's over yet.   It's ongoing.  
   
 Q.   Caroline said something to the effect of she couldn't beat you today because you played so well.   Does that make you proud?   
    MIRIM LEE:   That's a very nice comment and I'm very thank you thankful that Caroline said that.   
    She also played very well, but I think I had a little more luck on my side today.  
   
 Q.   Finally, what was it like playing with Stacy?   What did you take away from playing with the world No. 1?  
    MIRIM LEE:   Honestly, I've always wanted to play with Stacy.   I played with Inbee before, and I always thought, Wow, that's what it takes to be one of the best players in the world.  
    Usually when I play my rounds I don't watch the other players.   Today I really observed how Stacy played, and she was such a phenomenal player.   It shows why she is the No. 1 player in the world.  
   
 Q.   This was the first time you played with Stacy?   
    MIRIM LEE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   Awesome.   You're done.
