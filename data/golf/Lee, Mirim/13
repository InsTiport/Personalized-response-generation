 Q.  Great finish, awesome round.  Can you tell us about what went well today?  
MIRIM LEE: Still tough today.  Then I have lots of missed shots today, so it's a little tough day.   
 Q.  Obviously with the missed shots, but why also was the day a difficult day for you?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, just because driver's not good, so it's really a difficult day.  But I have lots of saves, up-and-down.  So I still -- I made good scores.   
 Q.  Even though it may have been difficult with the driver, you still -- is today still a successful round, or how would you describe it, good or bad?  
MIRIM LEE: The driver's getting better, but I don't know.  It's maybe need a little bit more practice.  So I have two weeks off, so maybe I fix that, and then I'm ready for the British Open.   
 Q.  Are you happy or mad with your round today?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, I'm happy today because still the score is good, so, yeah, I'm good.   
 Q.  I don't know if I asked this, but was there any pressure to play with the defending champ?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, I don't know.  She's really kind, so no pressure to play with her.  Just fun.   
 Q.  I'm sure you answered this already, but just overall, pretty good weekend for you?  
MIRIM LEE: Oh, yeah, it's long time because still -- still I fixed my swing.  So then, well, it's getting better.  So, yeah.  Maybe needed a little more practice.
