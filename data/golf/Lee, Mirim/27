 Q.  Explain what it's like, how to go through four rounds of sudden death.  How do you keep your emotions in check, and what was it like?  
MIRIM LEE: I just enjoyed the play.  I kept trying to -- my ball was going left to right, fade and then draw.   
 Q.  You made a really nice push at the end to get in.  You must have found something working in your game.  You put three birdies in a row to get to the sudden death playoff.  Can you talk about that?  
MIRIM LEE: I didn't know I'm in the lead.  I don't know, I just played, yeah.  I didn't think about the lead, just that I kept going, enjoyed playing.   
 Q.  When it kept going, it looked like it was going to be over, but then how do you refocus each time?  Is it just reset and you go back to the tee and go from there?  How do you refocus your mindset?  
MIRIM LEE: Same thing, yeah.  I just play and enjoy it.  I just keep hitting straight, straight.   
 Q.  What was it like with the crowd and everything?  You just kept doing the same thing.  What was it like?  Was it exciting?  It had to be very nerve-racking?  
MIRIM LEE: No, not nervous, just enjoy, excited.   
 Q.  How was the experience?  I know you came up short, but did you feel like it was a good experience for you?  
MIRIM LEE: Yeah.  Yeah.   
 Q.  How do you feel right now, mostly tired?  
MIRIM LEE: I just want to go home.  (Laughter.)
