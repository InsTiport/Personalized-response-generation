 Q. This day didn't go the way you wanted it to go. What happened today?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Well, they made all the birdies.

 Q. You got a good start early on. Did you think this could be a good day?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Well, yes, of course I did. That's all right. 

 Q. Tania, not exactly what you wanted to happen today. What happened? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, I don't know. We lost a stupid hole on 4, so that was back to all square, and then we were 1-up then after 5, and we didn't really make any birdies after that. They were playing good, and the crowds were screaming, and it was tough.

 Q. Did you guys make some bogeys? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, we made one on 4 and on 9. We three-putted.

 Q. Were they close?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, we three-putted on 9, both of us, so that was not a great thing to do at that moment.

 Q. What did these two do that was so hard to get --
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: They played good, but we didn't really put the pressure on them. That's the way it is.

 Q. Are you fired up for the afternoon? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah.
