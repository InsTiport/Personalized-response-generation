HELEN ALFREDSSON:  I knew I hadn't done anything, and everything was up to her and I was just praying for her to get it close.  (Inaudible.)  And then, all of a sudden:  I'll take that. 
 

Q.  Nothing but net?
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON:  Exactly.  Nothing but net. But it kind of makes life a lot easier. 
 

Q.  Is this the kind of shot, kind of turnaround that maybe tonight when the team meets, it could leave you a lot of momentum going into tomorrow, Day 2?
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON:  I think, obviously -- I don't know.  I don't think -- I don't think the girls have been playing that well.  The Americans have -- obviously have and they've been making the putts and returning the shots.  You know, we've just got to go back and talk and obviously make everybody a little fired up. 
 

Q.  There is no quitting on the European team?
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON:  There is no quitting. You're not getting very far if you're going to quit. We'll come back tomorrow. 
 

Q.  Good luck, Helen.
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON:  Thank you.
