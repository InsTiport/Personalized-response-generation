 Q. Talk about your very long round. 
 HELEN ALFREDSSON : Yeah, no, it was nice to have it done. I mean, it's obviously very sad for the tournament, because it's been a great tournament so far. 
 And, you know, the weather that you're having, it's finally nice to come out and play some golf.

 Q. How do you think you played over the three days?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON : No, you know, I played all right. We didn't play yesterday. I played all right, and then I made a couple of birdies today. So that was nice. 
 I only six holes to play today. But, yeah, I'm in a good position.

 Q. How tough is it to start, think you're gonna start, not start, and then come out and really face the cold?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON : Well, you have to sort of prepare yourself like you're playing like the full round, Obviously. 
 You get a little anxious because you just want to get out there and, you know, get it over with. I mean, the days, we don't know, so you're so many times getting -- you know prepare yourself and then you're back, and then you prepare yourself. 
 So it's a little tough. But you know what, that's how it is. It's not always perfect.

 Q. How are the course conditions out there?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON : It's surprisingly quite good. It's taken a lot of rain, this golf course, but I think the staff here has done -- you know, the grounds staff has done a remarkable job. 
 The greens are perfect. So that's a big deal when the greens are still nice to putt on. 

 Q. Perfect. Thank you. 
 HELEN ALFREDSSON : Thank you.
