FULLAUDIOINTERVIEW

  
Q. You made up some good ground, you got yourself in a pretty  
good position. 
  
HELEN ALFREDSSON: Yeah, it's all right. It's nice to be  
able to see the leaders for once. 
 
  
Q. How about just being able to finish?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Yeah, that's huge. That's huge. It's so nice to not have to get up at 7, especially the way it looks right now, I'm going to tee off late. So then you have to get up and then go back and then get out. So I'm very grateful that we finished early.
 
  
Q. That helps a lot of things. 
  
HELEN ALFREDSSON: Yeah.
 
  
Q. And it must feel just generally really good, you got yourself  
in a position that you haven't been in for a little bit here at the  
U.S. Open?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: No, for a long time. No, it's nice. It's fine. I like this golf course and I hit some good shots. And it gets rewarded. Yeah, no, it's all good right now.
 
  
Q. Last one, what worked for you today just generally and that?
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Well, I think just playing smart out here. Just hitting the right shots at the right time and not be too greedy.
  
The way you always have to play at a U.S. Open. And I made some  
good putts when I needed to. 
  
In general, I just kept myself in play. 
 
  
Q. You got a couple of birdies pretty early. 
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Yeah, which was nice. I was a little stressed in the morning, perhaps, but then I got into it a little bit. And when you get a few birdies, you get settled a little bit and I started hitting some good shots and, yeah, that was nice.
