  Q. How do you feel about your match?  
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: I feel great that we walked away with a win. It's very crucial that we get some blue on the board.   
 And I had a great time playing with Tania. I think she withstood the pressure very well for being her first match. And it was nice. We handled it very nicely.  
  
  Q. You guys started off pretty strong. How did you maintain the momentum or was there a point that you thought it was going to change out of your favor?  
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Knowing the Americans so well, I knew that they were -- obviously they were behind, and I knew that they were going to pick up, and Juli is such a great competitor, and so is Angela, so I knew that they were going to come on strong the last few holes; and they did. It was nice that we were able to pull it off.  
  
  Q. How does this prepare you for your next match?  
 HELEN ALFREDSSON: Well, you know, it's nice to come off with a high, and you know, make some putts. So I'm very happy with that.   
  
  Q. Thank you, congratulations.
