HELEN ALFREDSSON: I felt I played pretty well  today, especially the first 9, 10 holes.  I putted  pretty good too.  Betsy didn't have her best day in  putting today and it is tough. I mean, she is a great  player and obviously I was very happy to win, but it is  different ways you can win it, and you know, I was  happy for my points.  But you would like to win when  the other one is playing the best too.  But, I mean, I  can't really complain about my game, so... God, I am  babbling on here.  I don't know what to say.  The  bottom line is I won and I played pretty good.  So...   
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Yeah, I was really pleased  with my matches.  It was a bit unfortunate on 14 when  Patty's caddy kicked my ball and she incurred one  stroke penalty.  I felt I played really well.  I was  one under.  I didn't really think about playing better,  just thought about playing the golf course because I  didn't think I would take it back if I thought about  all the wins and Hall of Fame, so I just went out and  played the course.  It's a great played day and  thoroughly enjoyed it.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How did was it under a leaf or --  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: On the fairway?  Well, there  were a lot of leaves about, but I was just walking up.  I think he was looking at Patty's ball in the distance  she didn't hit it particularly well and didn't go very  far.  I don't think he expected it to be just in the  front of the fairway, to be honest with you.  I only  just got on the fairway.  I wasn't really looking and  then my caddy shouted to him Carl, Carl, and then he it  was too late.  He turned around, but he still kept  walking forward.   
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: Goal.  Soccer.  That was --   
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Soccer.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How long did you say that was?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: 14.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  You won the hole?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Yeah.  I mean, I think I  would have probably won it about 2 strokes.   
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think it has been a great  week for the Europeans.  I think maybe some people  thought that Dalmahoy was a freak result and I think  there has been some wonderful individual and team  performances from the European players, and I think it  has been a great week.  I mean, we are disappointed,  but we have had a great week.  We have had a lot of  fun.  We have had a great time and we look forward to  the next match.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Through the day, I think Europe was up in  five matches or certainly up in four with -- did you  think you were going to win at that time?  I am sure  you're aware of the score.  
 
MICKEY WALKER: The question is, was I aware  of we were up in about 5 matches at some point during  the day and did I think we were going to win it at that  point.  I had a real feeling that it was going to  wind up an even match.  I had a feeling we would win 5  points today and, yes, I mean, I really thought we were  going to retain The Cup.  And there were several sort  of key matches like Lotte's match, Laura's match,  Trish's match which it looked as if we were going to  win those matches and we sort of just lost out in those  three matches.  I mean, a couple of others, but, no, I  mean, I really thought we had a great chance to win and  we just were outplayed.  The Americans really played  well.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How does this Solheim compare to the previous  two in terms of galleries, course, just overall  organization?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: Well, going back to 1993 when  we played the inaugural one at Lake Nona, there were  very few spectators.  I suppose, you know, American  people, why would they want to turn up to watch their  top players who they can watch most weeks of the year  because I don't think they had much respect or knew  much about the talent in Europe at that time.  It was a  very one-sided match, there is no doubt.  It was also  put together at the last moment.  We really didn't know  the match was going to take place before four, five  months before it actually took place.  So there were  very few spectators at Lake Nona. It was a very low key  affair compared to this one.  I mean, this one has just  been enormous galleries, hundreds, literally, of the  world's press.  Television all across the world and --  I mean, it really has been the showcase of women's  golf, I think.  So, I mean this one has been absolutely  enormous.  Dalmahoy has been in between.  I would  imagine that each match will just get bigger and  bigger.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, you have just said it's a showcase of  women's golf.  So from a European point of view, the  tour is nowhere as strong as this one over here.  Do  you think that is doubly disappointing because we lost  13, 7?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I am sorry.  I don't  understand the question.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you think it is more disappointing from a  European perspective that we have lost by 13 to 7  because this was a showcase for European golf?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: No.  I think what is really  important, you know, the things I am about to tell you  we let off today.  One match was even going off into  the final day and a lot of the matches went to the 17  or 18th hole.  So there is no doubt that -- this is a  contest and on paper, regardless of what results Europe  achieved, the Americans are stronger.  We have the best  golfers in the world, but they definitely have more  strength and depth.  There is no argument with that.  Any one of the European team I am sure would agree with  that.  So, I think it speaks enormously for the team  spirit and the belief and the feeling that we have as a  team, that we have achieved the results in the three  matches that have taken place.  I think it is  absolutely incredible what we have achieved, and I  think we should all be proud of it.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you think therefore what, that the changes  planned for next time will make it harder, easier or  just the same?  
 
MICKEY WALKER:  I think that European women's golf is still  in its infancy, really.  The tour's only been going  since 1979.  People like Helen have only been playing  in America for a very short time and I think our top  European players are improving.  I mean, there has been  a radical improvement this year in a number of the  European player's games which is easy to see by the  results, and I think players such as Helen and Laura  and Lotte, Annika, I am not just picking out the  Swedes, I think the win that Alison had today -- I  think Alison is a tremendously talented player who is  capable of winning; being a winner in America as well  as in Europe she has proved.  But I think maybe she  hasn't had the belief in herself that her talent  deserves, and I think beating Patty today will give her  a huge boost.  Maybe she will believe that she is --  she can go out and really do well.  But I think we have  so much talent in Europe and so much young talent that  the amount of improvement that we can make in the  two-year spell before the next match is enormous.  I  mean, as we proved between Lake Nona and Dalmahoy and,  no, I think on paper, again, you would say the changes  have to favor the Americans, but we are going to have  more strength and depth that we have and I think it  will be a very good contest at St. Pierre and I think  with the home-crowd advantage, we really have a genuine  chance of bringing The Cup back to Europe.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you think made a big difference (check  question)?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think it made a difference,  yes.  The question was being -- being the away feel  make a big difference.  It certainly made a  difference.  I mean, home support, I think, is  important although we have fantastic support.  Obviously our supporters couldn't outswing, outclap the  American support, and you wouldn't expect that when  you're away from home anyway.  That is fine.  It is  great.  They should enjoy supporting their team when  their team win.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  You are going to be captain in two years, do  you think?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: If the team wants me, I will  be captain.   
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: Yeah.  (Thumbs up).   
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Indicating numbers up.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you think the galleries were fair this  week?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: Yes, I think they were quite  noisy and I think they were fair.  I think there was a  lot of good banter.  I have personally got about 30  members of the golf club, where I am a professional out  here supporting the Europeans and talking to them. They  have had great banter between themselves and the  American fans, and as I say, if the Americans weren't  noisier than us, then they really weren't supportive of  their team.  There would be something seriously wrong.  So we are happy.  We are happy for the Americans and  happy that they have enjoyed seeing all of us play.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Alison, do you think next year, the 1995  season, you will play anymore tournaments in the United  States; will we see more of you?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Yes, probably.  I am  probably going to play a little bit more than I have  over the last two years.  I am not exactly sure how  many at this stage of the game because I haven't seen  any of the schedules, but I am happy to play a bit  more, yeah.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, when you said that the changes in the  form will favor America, could you elaborate on that,  please?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I -- we did vote on something  the other day, or I think we did.  So, maybe I should  -- it is confirmation before I say something about  it.   
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: What is in here?  (Indicating her soda).   
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think there was -- the  changes are that there will be 12 people in each team,  that there will be a series of four matches, four  foursomes matches, four four ball matches each day.  So  four people will sit out each of the matches.  And it  was discussed and I believe it was voted on that  everybody, every member of the team had to play in at  least one of those matches.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  One of the four series?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: No, one of the -- I mean, as I  say, I am not 100% sure because we were trying to -- we  had an awful lot of discussion in a short period of  time, but I mean that certainly was put forward, that I  know the Solheim family would be keen to have that  happen, every one of the 12 players had to play at  least once each day.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  On Sunday it could be 12 matches, then 12  singles?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: Yes, there will be 12 singles  on the final day.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  But they won't all play in the foursome  matches will they?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: No, we only need 4 foursomes  and 12 people.  Four people will sit out each match.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Is it that fact that you think favors the  Americans or the mere fact that you are playing 36  holes a day?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: The question was, is it the  fact that we are playing 36 holes a day that I think  favors the Americans.  I think, again, there is no question, there  is no argument that the higher the number of the team  the more it's got to favor the Americans.  And we are  getting stronger all the time, but they do have more  strength and depth.  I mean, our top players are the  best in the world.  Again, there is no argument with  that.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Did you vote against this?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I don't know if I should say,  but what do you think?   
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: Rhetorical question.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  I thought the Europeans had the vote when it  was in Europe?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: This was at meeting that we  had this week.  I know what you are saying.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Oh.  
 
MICKEY WALKER: No, we are in America and this  Solheim Cup hadn't taken place, so...   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Could I ask Helen and Alison how they view  the prospect of playing 36 holes in one day?  
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: I guess we have to start  hitting the treadmill soon.  No, I think that would be  pretty good.  I would -- I have been voting for 36  holes all this time.  I think four matches each day or  five matches is not enough.  I think it is -- you have  a different strategy and I think it is good.  Match  play, in general, is not as tough as regular stroke  play and particularly four ball and foursomes.  It is a  little bit less mental extraneous.  So, I look forward  to playing 36?  Do you?  Good, no?   
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: I have to get on the  treadmill like you.  I am -- I look forward to that.  I  think we are particularly strong in the foursomes, that  will favor us.  Maybe a little bit younger too, 36  holes.  Whoohh.  (Applause).   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Would you comment about Dottie Mochrie, about  the way she has played?  Would you talk to us about  Dottie Mochrie and how she played; her attitude,  anything like that?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think she is an intensely  serious competitor who wants to win very badly.  She  wanted to be a member of the winning team very badly.  She didn't enjoy the experience of being on the losing  team at Dalmahoy and she played magnificent golf.  She  plays arguably -- I mean, you know, the scores in the  matches this afternoon, but I know for a fact that she  was 7 under par after 14 holes, that is phenomenal  scoring by anybody's standards.  Nobody is going to  live with that.  So you have to admire her and she is  very intense and totally gets into what she is doing  and she is more intense about how she goes about her  golf than some of us.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Is she too intense for herself?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: She is a great player.  She is  one of the best players in the world, so it works for  her.  We all have our own personalities.  A lot of  people think Alfie should change, and I think she  should carry onto what she is doing.  It is pretty  successful.  And Dottie is successful.  So you are  not -- if you said to Alfie you can't speak or enjoy  yourself on the golf course, I mean she won't be the  player she is. If you said to Dottie Mochrie you have  got to laugh on every hole, she wouldn't be the player  she is.  So...   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Did you feel her behavior was contrary to the  spirit of the matches?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: She is a very intense  competitor who wants to win.   
 
HELEN ALFREDSSON: They are looking for  quotes.   
 
MICKEY WALKER: We are all different in the  way we go about that.
