  Q. Helen, how important was this match?   
 HELEN ALFREDSSON:  All the points we can get is very important.  It's nice.   
  
  Q.  What makes these two so effective together, Sophie?   
 HELEN ALFREDSSON:  I think even though they're not playing their best, they keep fighting.  Both them are the kind players that you want to have.  They don't feel bad.  They push each other and hit the shots when they need to, and obviously they came through at the very end, which is great.   
  
  Q.  Pretty big last putt?   
 HELEN ALFREDSSON:  Absolutely.  This is what it's all about.  And the players know that.   
  
  Q.  Thank you.
