 Q.  So 4 under for today.  Tied for the best round of the Championship.  Talk to me about how you played today.  
MICHAEL BRADLEY: I actually played really good today.  I drove it well, hit a lot of good iron shots.  Honestly, 66 was as bad as I could have played.  I left a lot of shots, a lot of makable putts out there.   
I played well, but the conditions were very benign.  The course was soft.  The greens were soft, slower.  So, I mean, I said something to the guys in the 2nd hole, I thought somebody would shoot 65, 64 today just because the conditions were so different.   
But I played well.  I can't complain.  I wish I'd have made a couple more putts, but I'm happy with 66.   
 Q.  So it was mainly just the putter that let you down?  
MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah.  I made some putts but I just didn't -- you know, there were some I wish I would have made.  I left a lot right at the jaw short.  But it was a good day.  Overall if you'd have said I'm going to give you 66 before you tee off, I'd have said yeah.
