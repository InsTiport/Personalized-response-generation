   JOAN vt ALEXANDER: All right. We'd like to thank Michael Bradley for joining us here in the Media Center at the Stanford St. Jude Championship. Interesting day out there. Kind of been an interesting week, not a lot of low scores. Tough conditions. Just maybe talk about your round today, maybe some changes or some opportunities that you had and were able to keep the round together.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah. It's imperative you drive it in the fairway this week due to the wind conditions and the firmness of the greens. It allows you to control the flight and the spin of the ball. If you hit it out of the rough, you can't control either. With the wind and the firmness of the greens, you're going to have to be getting it up and down all week. That's one thing I've done pretty good this week is driven the ball in play.  
 Should be a lot of success to keeping it in the fairway the first two rounds.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Questions, please?  
  
  Q. 11 through 14 seems to be where a lot of players have had some trouble this week. Just talk about that stretch and what you got to do to get through those holes.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: 11 speaks for itself. Island green. It's been hard left to right both days. It's difficult golf shot.   
 12, water all the way down the right side and up by the green. Plays straight into the wind. You know.  
 13 is a good hole. They lengthened it probably 60 yards probably since where it used to be played from. It's a tough golf hole.   
 And, like I said, 14 really difficult par 3. Water is in play. Kind of an awkward angle with the green, wind direction. So it is, it's a tough stretch, you know. Water is in play. You can make a double bogey real quick.  
  
  Q. Talk about your golf game and where you're at. Obviously doing pretty well this week so far. But this year in particular how are things going as you work your way back into shape?  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: I haven't played -- this is only my fourth event this year, coming back from a broken ankle. But I've been playing pretty good. I haven't been putting that well. Went to a new putter this week, but I've been hitting it okay. So I hope I can continue to hit the ball well just to give myself opportunities. You know, if I don't make the putts, I don't make the putts, but at least give myself a chance.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: When and how did you break your ankle?  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Playing softball.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Last fall?  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Middle of last year, broke my right ankle.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Can we quickly go through go through your round. Birdie on 12.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah. Hit a good drive. I believe I hit a wedge about 5 feet, made the putt.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: 13, bogey.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Drove it down the mid, definitely hit it little bit long and right of the green. Chipped it up. About 7, 8 feet, missed it.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 16.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah. L-wedged it in there from about 50 yards.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 17.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: 17, I did. I hit 4-iron in 20 feet below the flag. Made birdie.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Bogey on 6.  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Bogey, just drove it in the left rough under a tree. Had to kind of chop it down the fairway. Didn't get up and down from the fairway.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 8.   
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: 8, I hit a good 6-iron to about 6 feet, made the putt.  
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Anything else? Thank you very much.
