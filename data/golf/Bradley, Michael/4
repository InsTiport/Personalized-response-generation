 Q. If you want to just talk about getting started today, putting up a good number and then being stopped with two holes left?
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah. You know what, it's unfortunate. The course is unplayable. There's a lot of water on the course. 
 So we're going to restart at 7 and go from there and I'll play my last two holes. 

 Q. How did you do this morning?
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Iron play and putting. Hit a lot of good iron shots. I putted well. Didn't drive it that well on the front nine, driving it a little better on the back nine. 

 Q. Now, the difference in the course coming back tomorrow, what do you expect to see?
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: It's just going to be wet, like it was today. It's going to be a little wet, but I mean like I said, it's two holes and I'm done. 

 Q. What did you do hanging out all day today?
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Was with them a lot till she had to go pick up our son at day care. Just hung out. We've done this before. It's nothing new. It's a pain, but you don't have a choice.
