   NELSON SILVERIO: All right. We welcome our first two-time champion of the Puerto Rico Open presented by seepuertorico.com. Michael Bradley, welcome to the media center. Congratulations. We've done this before, but if you wouldn't mind, just get us started just talking about the playoff. And to me it seemed like you had a similar putt last time there in the playoff. Could you just take us through the playoff and then on the week overall?   
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: The playoff first, well, you know, both Troy and I pretty much laid up. He was a little bit further than I was, but I think he had about 110, 111 to the hole. It was actually downwind. It was a perfect L-wedge for me.   
 And I hit a good shot. Troy's went a little bit long. He missed the putt. And I actually kind of thought the putt was going to move a little bit right, and my caddie, Noah, said, "I don't think it moved." And it didn't. And I missed it left.   
 But as it turned out, Troy missed his, so I don't know if that was turnabout fair play after that little putt I missed on the 72nd hole. But you hate to win a championship like that with somebody else missing a putt like that. But you know, I'm very happy to be a two-time champion of this event now, so I'll move on to next week.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: You know, Michael Breeze from the Golf Channel asked me that, and there's nothing in particular that -- you know, I enjoy the golf course. It's tropical like Florida where I live. I like the greens. I like the layout. There's no rhyme or reason why I have played well here. I can't put a finger on it, but I'm not going to question it.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Well, you know, like I told -- I felt good all week, kept my nerves in check, and I felt great. And I was a little nervous on the 72nd, on the last hole on the first putt, I was a little nervous. I mean I get over the putt, my hands were shaking. I couldn't believe it. All week I was fine and on that putt my hands were shaking. And missed the putt. I guess that's what a 45-year-old, that's what happens to you when you get old.  
 But yeah, it would have been disappointing if I would have ended up losing the tournament because I missed that putt and then lost in the playoff. Would have been disappointing, but I don't have to worry about it anymore. It worked out, I guess, in my favor.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: What about the sudden death?   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: How I was feeling or just how the hole was?  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: You know, I was fine. Moving back to the tee I was fine. First shot, second shot the L-wedge in, I felt pretty good. I did feel a little -- I was getting a little bit nervous on the putt again. I could feel it. You know, I just -- I don't know. But you know, I didn't make it, but fortunately I didn't have to make it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Yeah. We had a few. Obviously Angel played ahead of me the last two days, and he's obviously got a big following here, but as I said in the ceremony that I meant what I said, that I really feel like, you know, the people in Puerto Rico have really opened their arms and hearts to me and have been very supportive of me. And you can just tell. That means a lot. Not only is this a win for me, but hopefully it's a win for them, too.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Well, you know, this year was, I would say, the last year of my exemption, so I obviously had to finish in the Top 125 or win or whatever the case may be.   
 So obviously there was a lot of -- there was a lot riding on this week. If I lose, and you know, I finish second and blah, blah, blah, but obviously not the same perks as the win is. So that'll -- that's going to probably carry me to almost 48. So I won't be too far from the senior tour, Champions Tour, but it's nice to say four-time champion because it's my fourth win on TOUR.   
 I gotta be honest. I never thought that I would say that. So it means a lot, especially I've won twice -- since I was 42, I've won twice. So my schedule won't change much. I'll probably play Tampa next week and probably take a week off and it's been five out of six. Tampa will be five out of six, and I'm tired. Especially now I'm really tired.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: That I will do special? Help my family, my wife and kids. That's what's important to me. That's who I want to know. Everything else is inconsequential.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Don't know. That question was asked five minutes ago. I don't know. I can't put a finger on it. I enjoy the golf course. I enjoy the weather. It's warm. It's like Florida. I've just played well here. Don't know why. I don't want to know why.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: Well, it was awfully tough. That's a good stretch of golf. 11, 12, 13, 14, that's a good stretch of golf. You know, that's kind of crunch time. If you can get through 11, 12, 13, 14, you've got two par-5s. 16 was downwind today, so it was a short iron.   
 And then spin on 17 was tough, so it makes it a little tough to get at. But if you can get by 11, 12, 13, 14, then maybe you can make a birdie or two coming in.   
 Then I parred 11, 12, 13 and missed a shortest putt for par on 14.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 MICHAEL BRADLEY: No. You know, after the Hope, I played really well and then I got on those poa annua greens, and it got into my whole game. I don't putt poa annua well. I don't read them. My speed's bad.   
 The next thing you know, you start forcing it thinking I gotta hit it a foot, because if I hit it 10 feet, I'm not going to make it. And it just trickles down into your game. You miss a green and you're going, I can't get nothing down. So it just kind of got very disheartening knowing that here we go, poa annua.   
 I mean I was positive. I try to stay positive, and get out there in LA knocking down the par-5 in two, 30-footer and then three-putt, started my day. Go to the next hole, miss it from five feet for par. Done. It's just kind of how it was. I've never done well on the West Coast. Just never have.
