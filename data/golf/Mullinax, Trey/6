 Q.  Excellent play.  Just get some comments on your round.  
TREY MULLINAX: Yeah, I played really well, hit the ball nice, made some really good putts today, putter kind of kept me in it.  But hit a lot of really good shots, hit a lot of fairways, approach to the green was pretty nice today and so got the putts to fall to be able to shoot a low one.   
 Q.  Really trending well so far since January.  Just talk a little bit about the confidence you're playing with right now.  
TREY MULLINAX: Yeah, playing pretty confident.  I'm just trying to do what I can.  I'm working really hard, I'm sticking to the process.  I know I had a few rough patches at first, but sticking to what I'm doing, I know it's the right way to do it and so just trying to work on everything and just know that it's all going to come together and just try to play that way.   
 Q.  Next to last group tomorrow.  What are your expectations on what it's going to be like during the stretch?  
TREY MULLINAX: I'm going to tee it up on 1 and I'm going to enjoy it.  I've been in this situation before, I got some experience in that area, so just try to have fun and play golf.  I got my family here with me and my little girl, so I'm going to go home tonight and hug on her and rock her to sleep and I'll figure out what tomorrow holds tomorrow.
