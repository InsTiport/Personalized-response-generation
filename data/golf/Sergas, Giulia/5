  Q. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your round. How did it go? What was your general reaction to what happened today?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Oh, I hit great, beautiful shots. Probably many, many perfect ones. So it's quite amazing in a round of golf.  
  
  Q. But you did so well.   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Yeah, very well.   
  
  Q. What's the course like?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: The course is big greens - big, big greens - so you hit a lot of greens, and you have sometimes really long putts and it's very undulated.  
 A few holes are long and few holes are short, so it's a good mix.   
  
  Q. How was the wind versus yesterday?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: The wind was picking up a little bit and then it quiet down. I mean, it's a gorgeous day. Yeah, gorgeous day.   
  
  Q. Any surprises today?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Surprise? No, no surprise.  
  
  Q. How do you feel going into the rest of the tournament?  
 GIULIA SERGAS: Great, great.  
  
  Q. You looking forward to taking this thing?  
 GIULIA SERGAS: Yes, I am.   
  
  Q. Best of luck to you.   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Thank you.
