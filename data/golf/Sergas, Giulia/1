Q. So 12 under going into the weekend.  What's been the key to your success so far this week?
GIULIA SERGAS: It's a great week because Constantino Rocca is following me, and he's right there on my side, and I love it.
Q. How did that come about?
GIULIA SERGAS: We started to work together in January, and he's a wonderful person, and he's just -- he just gave me so much.
Q. That's awesome.
GIULIA SERGAS: Yeah.
Q. So you're playing on a medical.  What was the issue that caused you to have to take --
GIULIA SERGAS: I broke my ankle last year.
Q. And how long did it take you to get back from that?
GIULIA SERGAS: Oh, two months.  Two months no golf.  And then I played very few events at the end of the year, and here we are.
Q. So, obviously, being an Olympic year too, how important would it be for you to have a good finish here and hopefully move up in those rankings?
GIULIA SERGAS: Very important to be steady and keep what I've been working on, keep it going.  And give myself a chance to play as many events as I can.
Q. What are some of those things that you've been working on in your game coming off the injury?
GIULIA SERGAS: A lot.  I mean, Constantino has just so much knowledge about the game, and there's so little things.  This level is just about inches, and he knows the inches.  So he gave me all the steps that I was looking for and that it's very hard to get if you don't get experience on tour.
