Q.   (No Microphone.)
GIULIA SERGAS:   I was down the whole match and I actually, I have to say, Jessica is such a competitor.   She's so nice and she's my favorite American player.
So I was lucky to be paired with her.   So I had a fantastic time with her and she's a great player.

Q.   I guess the key was yesterday afternoon really, wasn't it?
GIULIA SERGAS:   Oh, of course.   I mean my teammates.   I was the cheerleader, I was the best cheerleader.   No comparison to any of these Americans cheering, I mean I was the best cheerleader there is. 

Q.   It was a proud moment for you and a proud moment for Europe as well?
GIULIA SERGAS:   Of course.   Of course.
