   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Giulia, great round. Only one bogey, and you're 10-under par, so you're tied for the lead.  
 GIULIA SERGAS: That's right.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: How are you feeling right now? You had a lot of great, long putts that you made.  
 GIULIA SERGAS: I did. That is what I was waiting for, because my long game is really steady, has been for the past years.   
 So that's what I'm looking for: good putts.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Have you been working on it with a coach or just practice?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: I been working with my caddie, so we putted last week for a long time.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: It's paying off. That's great.   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Yeah, absolutely. We are really happy.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Questions.   
  
  Q. What changed today from the first day?  
 GIULIA SERGAS: Um, probably my -- I hit it closer a few times, and I hit it more pure with my irons. Then I had two long putts that made a difference.   
 But, you know, it's inches, so nothing really.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about the next few days? You're in the lead. How does it look with two more days to go?  
 GIULIA SERGAS: It's good. It's exciting. I love this. This is training for me. This is why I came here.  
 You know, I gave up so many things for golf. Definitely I'm gonna live it to the fullest.   
  
  Q. You said you practiced putting for a long time. How long?  
 GIULIA SERGAS: It was like two hours a day.  
  
  Q. Have you been keeping up the schedule here, or how has it been different here?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Yeah, here, well, I work on it. Putting is you work on it, you work on it, because you are looking for something.   
 You're working on a feel that you have to get. When you get that feel, then you can -- it's different. You work until you get that feel. When you get that feel, you are ready to go.  
  
  Q. So do you feel like you're there?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: Yeah, we finished the round and I told Lee, I think, you know, we got it. I'm really happy. Yep.   
  
  Q. Is there anything on this course that you have to look out for compared to other courses you golfed? Anything in particular that sticks out as a hazard, a problem, or as a good thing?   
 GIULIA SERGAS: No, I think I had pretty much figured out there some lines we have to take care of. Because we can fly a lot of traps on the golf course. They made it short. Probably too short for us.  
 So anyway, we have to fly over big bunkers and rough. Sometimes you can't see the fairway behind it, so you have to be perfectly spotted on the line you are picking, like a tree or something. If you misjudge that, then you might be too long. Perfect driver, but maybe you crossed the fairway or something.  
 So I would say that that would be the only thing.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you all very much. Giulia, great round.  
 GIULIA SERGAS: Thank you.
