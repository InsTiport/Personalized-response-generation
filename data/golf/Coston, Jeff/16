 Q.  Couple thoughts on the round. 
 JEFF COSTON:  The round?  Well after about three holes I was ready to carry the bag for my caddie.  I was not in the zone, I was in the morose zone or the ozone, but not the go zone.  But it was tough. 
 I think I started off double bogey, par, double bogey, you know. 
 Fortunately, you know, I got the train back on the track a little bit.  So it was definitely not a peaceful, fun loving, hallelujah round for sure. 

 Q.  Talk about the conditions.  The wind died down? 
 JEFF COSTON:  Yeah.  A beautiful day.  The best conditions of the week.  So yeah, that was pure.  The course was pure.  The course is hard. 
 But it was a beautiful day.  Couldn't have asked for more.  So it wasn't the weather.  I couldn't blame it on weather, I couldn't blame it on anything.  Other than hanging around with you.  Maybe I can blame you.  I wish it would have blown a little harder.
