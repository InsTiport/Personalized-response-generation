  JEFF COSTON:   I was in my zone, doing what I needed to do.   And you know, I felt like I hit the drive decent on No. 16 today, the wind took it hard and obviously some judgment errors with the wind, and obviously that's why the scores got so high.   So I made some judgment errors.   
I made a mistake on 7 and I made another judgemental error on 8.   So I made a few errors.   That's easy to do out here.   
   
 Q.   Where was your head after the birdie on 5, making the cut?   
JEFF COSTON:   Never thought about that.   Just trying to execute and play golf.   I mean, just trying to make it as much like normal golf as possible.   In these things‑‑ fallen into those traps before, so I was just trying to execute.   I just got on a bad run for a while.   It was difficult.   So that's my story and I'm sticking with it.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever seen the course this hard?   
JEFF COSTON:   No, because the time I've played it, it was pretty hard in 2005 in the Professional National Championship, but the tees were up.   But man, these greens are good.   These greens are really good.   So you know, it's just hard.   The wind is blowing hard.   It's like, man, the wind is going left‑to‑right, you couldn't really draw it.   When it was going right‑to‑left, hit big hooks, so it was challenging.
