  Q. What were some of the highlights of your round today?  
 JEFF COSTON: I got a great up-and-down on the last hole for a par. I hit a good wedge in there. That would be one thing. I didn't get too much hair blown out of my head, so, but, no, the greens were great, they rolled true and pure. The course is in great shape. Just look forward to hitting some more fairways and greens tomorrow. But I am pleased to be here. I'm just a broken down old club pro, just happy to be here.  
  
  Q. What type of impact did the wind have on your round today?  
 JEFF COSTON: I felt like the wind made you think, but it wasn't like unplayable or anything like that. So I was concerned from yesterday and Monday with regards to the wind and but I think that the PGA did a great job of slowing the greens down a little bit so the ball didn't blow off the green. So that's huge. Smart people at PGA.   
  
  Q. How do you feel after today going forward the rest of the tournament?  
 JEFF COSTON: Well I would like to have scored lower. I made a lot of mistakes today. I don't usually make that many mistakes. So hopefully make some birdies tomorrow and maybe the wind will blow in the morning and not in the afternoon.
