 Q. How did your round go today?
 JEFF COSTON: Probably the worst ball striking I can remember having. I don't know how many greens I hit, I only hit five greens and I don't even know how many fairways I hit. I did not do my best. 
 Fortunately, I was 1-under at one time, but got on the wrong train, the bogey train, and it took me to never never land. But happy to be here, fortunate to be here, it's a wonderful golf course and hopefully I can do a better job tomorrow.

 Q. Do you think the weather impacted your play?
 JEFF COSTON: I think it was just all me. It's a very difficult golf course. You have to hit fairways. And so if you are not hitting the fairways and greens it's very, very challenging. 
 But I played in a lot worse weather than this, but I'm glad that they didn't roll and quadruple cut the greens because I would probably still be out there. 

 Q. What do you have to do over the next couple days to improve?
 JEFF COSTON: Hit fairways and greens. Got to be really good. If you have secret, let me know. If have you fairy dust in your pockets or anything, I'll take some.
