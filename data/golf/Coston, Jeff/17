  Q.  You said yesterday that you would take even par.   
 JEFF COSTON:  Did I?  I should take even par.  If you let me stay in the clubhouse I'll stay here and just wave at everybody.   
  
  Q.  A great save there on 18.   
 JEFF COSTON:  It was all my caddie -- no, just kidding.  I think.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that's a number you can shoot for every day and be pretty happy with, even par?   
 JEFF COSTON:  I don't know.  I think yesterday pars were good scores, as I said yesterday.  But I would take pars on 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.  I don't even know.  I just want to have fun and play golf like I know how to my full potential.  I don't care what place I get.   
  
  Q.  Did you have fun today?   
 JEFF COSTON:  I had fun today.  I have a friend caddying for me whose been my friend for 20 years.  It's nice hanging out at night.  Like I said I can't get him to watch American Idol, but I watched it.  But we watched 24 and that.   
  
  Q.  What kind of expectations did you have coming into the week?   
 JEFF COSTON:  I feel like, remember Rocky, those shows and that guy, what was that guy, Mr. T, what was his name?  Pain?  No, I'm just kidding.  I try not to have any expectations.  Is that good?  I read that in Golf for Women.  It was really a good article.
