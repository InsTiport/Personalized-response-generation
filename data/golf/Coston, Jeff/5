Q.   Talk about your round today. 
JEFF COSTON:   Well, it was interesting, I flew in this morning from, played in the Washington Open that ended yesterday, so I came here like on the 12 of the May, Mother's Day and played on Monday, Tuesday, flew home, played in the Washington Open Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, through all night, got in at 8:30 this morning, and here I am, man.   So that was a big deal. 
Last group fortunately worked out well and Dudley caddied for me like since 1987, at least one event a year, so we had a good time.   And just tried to just play golf.   It's just golf, man. 

Q.   How did the course play today, especially with all the rain?
JEFF COSTON:   It's interesting, I'm from Seattle, right, so people in Seattle don't tan, they rust.   So it was weird though, I put that rain jacket on and off about 10 times I imagine.   But it's a wonderful golf course, great shape, the greens are pure as pure could be.   And happy to be here.
