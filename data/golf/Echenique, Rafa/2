 Q. A fantastic round today and that albatross on the 18th was the first in the 21-year history of the event; how does that feel? 
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Well, it's fantastic. I have a great sensation. I played really good, really good for four days and today was the point was I was really quiet on the first holes, I made birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey, it was quiet, and then I made a great eagle on No. 11. And then I starred making putts, putts. It's unbelievable. 
 This is a dream for me, and I would like to share with all my team with my family, with my manager with my coach and I think this is for everybody. 

 Q. Just talk us through that second shot to 18. 
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Well, I hit a great driver and then it I was 243 yards to the pin. The wind helped a little bit to the left and I hit a great shot, a little draw with a 3-iron. I didn't understand when the crowd tried to -- I didn't believe it. 

 Q. Did you enjoy your celebration?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Yeah, too much, too much. I think I enjoyed too much. I qualified also for the British Open. I am really, really happy.

 Q. Is this one of your greatest moments in golf at the moment?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: For sure, absolutely.

 Q. And did everything just gel today, you shot a round of 62, is that your lowest performance, your lowest score on The European Tour?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: On The European Tour, yes, 62, my lowest, and with 27 on the back nine, that's great.

 Q. You lead in the clubhouse at 21-under par, will you be watching Nick Dougherty very closely?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Well, I'm going to watch. I was a flight at 7:10 to Madrid but I think I am going to miss and relax and enjoy the moment and go to Madrid tomorrow and stay with my family who is waiting for me with my mom, also, very, very happy. 

 Q. Had you had an albatross before? 
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: No. First one.
