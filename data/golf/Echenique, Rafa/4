 Q. A very good day?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Yeah, I played very, very well. I started playing well on my first nine holes, and then on the last nine, I don't play really well, but I sank many putts for par. 

 Q. As satisfying as the birdies, isn't it, to hold your score together like that?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Yeah, I started playing very well the last few weeks. I started playing much better and also my putter is helping. I hope to continue, because it's the first round and there's a few more days to go. There's a long way.

 Q. In Wales you held things together very nicely. That was a good finish. 
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Yeah it was a very good finish, because I didn't start really well in January in the first tournament, and the BMW PGA at Wentworth, and then Wales, I changed my mind and my coach helped me. 

 Q. Are you guilty of doing that, just changing your mind and forgetting what you should be doing? 
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: Yes, you never know in this sport. Some weeks are very good and some weeks are terrible. You have to be patient.

 Q. Did you see anything of the Argentina football last night?
 RAFA ECHENIQUE: No, I didn't, because too late for us, but I talked with a friend of mine -- and also, I hope we start really well, but we'll see. We have a really good team, but all season long, you never know. Paraguay is playing very good.
