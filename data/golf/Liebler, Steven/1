 Q.  Crazy match.  
STEVEN LIEBLER: It was.   
 Q.  Take me through what you're feeling right now.  
STEVEN LIEBLER: Obviously I'm a little disappointed.  I played very solid.  In 21 holes I made 20 pars and one bogey, and it's just one bogey too many.  You know, I played pretty solid.  I had a chance, I thought, to really kind of take advantage of the match on the 8th hole with a three-foot putt after he'd already made par, and I didn't make it, and I think that was the turning point in the match.  He played solid after that.   
 Q.  I mean, anything else you want to say about your experience here?  
STEVEN LIEBLER: Well, you know, the golf course was fabulous.  The hospitality was unbelievable.  They did a fabulous job.  I've got to hand it to the fact that they had so many volunteers that took care of us.  It really made me feel welcome, and it was a great event.   
 Q.  Since you have a two-year exemption now as a semifinalist, will you take advantage of that and will we see you back at future U.S. Senior Ams?  
STEVEN LIEBLER: Well, I hope so.  Obviously that depends on my work schedule, but I'm looking forward to that opportunity.
