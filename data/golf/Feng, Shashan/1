 Q.  Can you talk to us about your bogey-free round today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, I'm happy about it because the last two days, I mean, I wasn't playing like Shanshan, because normally I don't make that many mistakes.  But I made three bogies on the first day, and a double and a bogey yesterday.  So I was a little bit frustrated, and then I talked to myself, and I said, hey, I'm still making birdies.  I just need to cut down my mistakes.  I think that's what I did really well today, so I'm really happy about it.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your position now on the leaderboard?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I have no idea where I'm at.  You know that.  You know that.  So I don't even know where I'm at.  I know I should be a little bit better than yesterday, at least.  I believe I would have a little bit later tee time tomorrow.  Hopefully all the fans can come out and cheer for me.  And I'll try to bring my A-game just like normal.   
 Q.  Did you work on anything between second and third round that paid off today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Not really, but I think what I did was maybe not to hit driver every hole.  Like some holes that maybe I would choose to hit 3-wood off the tee sometimes to take the hazard out of the way.  Then yesterday I played great, but just that one drive in the rough and just couldn't get it out.  I think today I hit most of the fairways, and I hit most of the greens.  I think that's why I was pretty consistent today.   
 Q.  Do you have a number in mind for tomorrow and what it would take?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I was going for 15-under.  Yeah, so I mean, now I'm 8.  So I have 7 to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  Doable?  
SHANSHAN FENG: It is possible.  Why not?  Yeah, I mean, the weather has been really good for us this year so far.  So I believe there are some low scores out there, and I'm ready to go low.
