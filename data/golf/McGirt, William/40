Q.   3‑under, probably a good way to start, but you were at 5‑under at one point, so you didn't finish like you'd like, but still, a good way to play today?
WILL McGIRT:   Yeah, it was a good score, but I drove it all over a lot of the day.   Hit a couple loose iron shots there at the end, didn't birdie any of the par‑5s.   Gave a few away, but made a few putts I shouldn't have made, so I guess it all evens out in the end, but disappointed in the finish.

Q.   Did you have any long putts or highlights in the round, anything out of the ordinary?
WILL McGIRT:   I made four in a row, all from about probably 12 to 18 feet to start the back nine.   But I made probably a 20‑, 25‑footer there on 7.   You know, solid day, snuck a few in there.   But definitely not very pleased with my ball‑striking right now.

Q.   Is Waialae playing about the same as it's played every other time you've been here?
WILL McGIRT:   Yeah, I mean, it was fairly calm, a little different wind direction than what I've played in the past.   Fairways are starting to chase out.   I just hit a couple 3‑woods there over 300 yards coming in.   You can definitely chase balls up.   I mean, that's the good thing about this golf course is if you drive it in the rough, it gives you a way to chase the ball up the middle of the green.   It doesn't force you into flying everything on the green.   That's why I think it's one of the best we play.   It doesn't really matter how far you hit it out here, it's about how straight you hit it, and when you drive it off line, it's about getting it back in play.
The good thing is the greens out here, the way the areas are designed in front, you can run shots up.
