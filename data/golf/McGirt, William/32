 Q.   Can you talk about your round today?  
WILLIAM McGIRT:   I played solid all week, drove it well, and the few times I hit it in the rough, I got really lucky with the lies.   I don't think I had to lay‑up one single time, which is very lucky, with as deep and as thick as this rough is.  
Today, I played solid all day.   I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.   I left 3‑putts dead in the heart short.   Don't know how they were slow as they were but all in all, it was just a solid round of golf.   
The bogey I made, I'm sitting here thinking about holing the bunker shot and there was about three times as much sand under it as I thought there was, and I actually made a great up‑and‑down just for bogey.   
I was very pleased with the week.   This is a long, tough, hard golf course, and I played solid all week.   Proud of myself.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel with this now under your belt going into the rest of the Playoffs?   
WILLIAM McGIRT:   Well, I think it should get me through to Denver now.   So my goal now is try to get in the Top‑30.   You're almost free‑wheeling at this point.   So like I said, get in and just try to keep advancing every week, keep moving up the feed ex‑cup list and get as many points as I can.
