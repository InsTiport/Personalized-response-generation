Q. On 16, that's match play golf at it's finest, isn't it?
WILLIAM McGIRT: It's 100 percent match play.  I'm standing there thinking one thing, either make it or go pick his coin up and hand it to him.  Luckily it came out perfect and basically went right in the center.
Q. Branden Grace, he went unbeaten in the Presidents Cup a couple of years ago in Korea.  He has played very nicely in this tournament in years gone by.  How proud of that performance are you?
WILLIAM McGIRT: Very proud.  The thing is Grace and I are such good buddies.  It's just one of those things, we had fun all day.  Got a little quiet on the back nine.  He got a little hot when I had ten feet for birdie over there on 13 and the gust blows my ball and now I've got 35 feet.  Almost blew it in the water.  He actually got hot with the officials on that, too.  We couldn't get a ball to stay on that green.  That's just the way it is.  It's just me and him, so it's not like stroke play.  It would have been impossible to play stroke play out here today.  I will tell you that.
Q. You control your destiny now with those two wins.  A halve tomorrow you are already through.
WILLIAM McGIRT: Yeah, go back and get a good night of sleep, get a good dinner and see if we can do it again tomorrow.
