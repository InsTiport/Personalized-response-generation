 Q.   What a great round of golf today, eight birdies and a couple of bogeys; talk about the putter today, was unbelievable?  
WILLIAM McGIRT:     Just played really solid, hit a lot of good iron shots and good putts.   Just one of those days you could see the line.   
You know, I felt like on the putting green, my stroke felt fast, and I've been working hard trying to slow it down.   So nothing felt good warming up, putter didn't feel good and the swing really didn't feel good.   Maybe there's something to it.   
   
 Q.   You have a twoâ€‘shot lead, you've had a couple of seconds in your career, so how do you approach this final round?  
WILLIAM McGIRT:   It's just 18 more holes and whatever is going to happen is going to happen.   All I can do is go out and play the best I can.   
   
 Q.   Has the putting been the difference, you've played here a couple of times and you haven't made the cut.   
WILLIAM McGIRT:   I think the big thing is the golf course is playing much faster and getting some run and the ball can carry.   It's probably 15 degrees warmer than I've of played it here, it's not overcast, and so the ball is kind of chasing a little bit.   Helps me out a bunch.
