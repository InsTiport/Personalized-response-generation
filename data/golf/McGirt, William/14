 Q.  Lovely win over Brandt Snedeker.  You really sort of fought back from a small down position with 4 holes to play.  
WILLIAM McGIRT: Yeah, I was 1 down on the front and birdied 4 to square it.  We had a little pillow fight there for a while with a bunch of pars.  He made a great birdie and then I had a good wedge in there on 15 and 16.  All in all, it's pretty solid.   
 Q.  A hang tough performance by you.  
WILLIAM McGIRT: I struggled all year with my game.  I haven't hit it very well.  Haven't driven it very well.  Haven't putted it very well.  I've managed to kind of get through it.  That's all today was, was kind of managing it and taking advantage when you had some opportunities.   
 Q.  You've got Braden Grace, a renowned match player, in the second round.  
WILLIAM McGIRT: Grace and I are good buddies.  Played together last week, so it will be fun.  I told him, I said, if we both play like we did last week, it might be the world's worst pillow fight anybody has ever seen.  Hopefully we'll play a little better tomorrow.
