   WILLIAM McGIRT: I needed to play well this week to give myself a chance and that's what I've done. I played very aggressive yesterday. I really wish I could have finished that round last night. I was hitting it well, I was rolling it well.   
 Going back out this morning, it looked more a thimble but I feel like I'm playing pretty well but we'll see what happens tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You looked very calm for a man who got it really deep in just seven or eight holes?  
 WILLIAM McGIRT: I got -- I shouldn't tell you what happened. I started hitting shots close, started making putts. The whole key to yesterday, I made about a 15 or 18-footer for par on 3 and got it up-and-down out of the left bunker. I mean, I was dead and that kick started the whole thing. I made about a 25- to 30-footer for birdie on the next hole and got it up-and-down on the back fringe.   
 Yeah, kind of got everything going, but hey, it's golf and the worst thing I could finish this week is 125.
