 Q.  Let's start almost going in reverse and start on your last hole.  You thought that was in the bottom of the cup, didn't you?  
WILLIAM McGIRT: Yeah, I mean, I knew it was going to be close.  It kind of lost speed there at the end.  It's a little slower than I thought it was, but kind of looked like it was going to hang in there and kind of fall over the front right corner.  Right at the end it kind of fell off the hole instead of falling in.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you needed that birdie, looking at the leaderboard right now?  
WILLIAM McGIRT: Yeah, I took a good, hard look at the leaderboard when I got on the green.  Badds was putting, and saw that Peter had gotten it to 18 and DT is at 17, a bunch of guys at 16, a lot of holes left.  I felt like when I made the turn, I had a look at the leaderboard, I felt like 18 was probably a playoff and 19 was probably clear.  But you know, some golf left.  Who knows, we'll see.
