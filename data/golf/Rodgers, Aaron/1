 Q.  Just a couple quick comments about playing with Ho Sung this week.  Your thoughts on his game?  
AARON RODGERS: Yeah, it was fantastic.  He's just a super guy.  We had him over to the house last night, him and his family.  We had a blast.  Like there's obviously some loss in translation with the language barrier, but we had his translator there, and we just had a blast.  He's a great guy, I think it's great for the tournament and for golf.  Obviously his swing gets a lot of attention, but he's a good player.  It was tough conditions out there.  Him and Jerry both struggled today.  But he's a super guy and it was a lot of fun to play with him.
