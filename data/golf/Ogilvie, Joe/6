  Q. There was a whole lot of marks on that scorecard there.   
 JOE OGILVIE: Yeah, it looked like an easter egg! There was a lot of birdies, I think I had 12 birdies, an eagle and a double. And I don't know how many bogeys I had, maybe 8. I'm playing well.   
 I'm making way lot of mistakes, but I'm playing well. I'm making mistakes because I'm playing very aggressive.   
  
  Q. You've been good on the greens, 26 putts the first two rounds.   
 JOE OGILVIE: Yeah, and it's funny, I've made a lot of good putts; I hit it in there close. I think four of my birdies today were inside of 6 feet maybe. I've hit it in there close, missed a few putts, but I'm rolling it well and for me I'm hitting it extraordinarily well. So I feel good around this place.  
  
  Q. Glad to have it in the house before you have any winds this afternoon?   
 JOE OGILVIE: Well, I hope the heavy winds come just to show case these guys and how good they are. Hopefully we get gusts up to 30 and the viewers or the listeners can see how good the PGA TOUR players really are.   
  
  Q. Did the greens get faster?   
 JOE OGILVIE: The golf course did speed up a little bit, especially on the greens. The wind is blowing so hard, if you have a down wind, downhill putt, it's extraordinarily fast.   
 If you're beyond the pin on 14 there is going to be a lot of 3-putting.   
  
  Q. Enjoy the afternoon.   
 JOE OGILVIE: Thanks.
