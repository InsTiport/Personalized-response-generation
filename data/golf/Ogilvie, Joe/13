 Q. Joe, 3-under. Got to feel pretty good about that. 
 JOE OGILVIE: Yeah, good start. Tough day today. Seven birdies and four bogeys, and I think the key was every time I made a bogey I followed up with a birdie. 
 Golf course is playing fantastic: Firm, fast, greens are gonna get more and more crusty and faster as the tournament goes on. Gonna play exactly the way it played two years ago.

 Q. Is wind a factor, or becoming more of a factor?
 JOE OGILVIE: Becoming more of a factor. You know, I think what it does is you kind of get blown around a little bit and the ball goes in the trees a lot easier. 
 But the rough isn't as bad because there're no humidity. It isn't a thick rough. It's kind of a wispy rough, so you can get out of it and play some shots. 
 But if you miss the greens, the greens are getting so firm that you don't have that initial check on the ball. So it's gonna be is fun week.

 Q. Can you approach it like you did two years ago?
 JOE OGILVIE: Yeah, I mean, you know, I feel very comfortable around here. I played well last year. I feel very comfortable on this golf course. I can pick my way around it. I don't need to hit driver on every shot for every hole. There's a lot of 3-woods and a lot of 3-irons. So it's just is fun golf course to play. 
 I'm rolling the rocks pretty well right now. I feel pretty good.

 Q. With Richard not being here, I guess you're kind of the defending champ. 
 JOE OGILVIE: Well, exactly. He goes, you're gonna have to take my mantel. It would be nice to sort of repeat, I guess. I do have the first parking space up there. 
 No, I mean, I still feel like -- I don't feel like I'm the defending champion, but I feel very comfortable having won and being the last winner here.
