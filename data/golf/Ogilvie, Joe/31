Q. Talk about coming back and having to play and how difficult it is to kind of get warmed up for these conditions.
JOE OGILVIE:  Especially today since it's not very warm.  You know, it's always funny, you could get a bad end of the draw and you can get a good end of drought.  I turned out to have a great end of the draw.  I played the back side first, I finished on the front side and 8 and 9 were playing downwind.  Guys finishing on 17 and 18, they are now into the wind.

I guess it depends on what side of the draw you are, but we're used to playing early.  I think the West Coast has conditioned us from for being delayed.  It's kind of old hat.
Q.  You came out and barely played four and a half holes you started with a birdie.
JOE OGILVIE:  Yeah, hit a good 9-iron to about six feet and that was kind of a good start.
Q.  Par 5 was adventurous.
JOE OGILVIE:  The par 5 was adventurous.  I just kind of made par there.  Made a good par there and then made three solid pars coming in.  We'll see what happens.  I tee off at six o'clock.  I think that's the hardest thing; you've got ten more hours.
Q.  You have a long wait to play again.
JOE OGILVIE:  My lawyer said that I shouldn't talk about anything.  (Laughter.)
Q.  But you come back, you have to wait and then you'll get another four holes in, so you player twice today and you don't even play nine.
JOE OGILVIE:  I think that's probably the most difficult.  I may not even get four holes in.  The good thing is it's supposed to be warm on the weekend and sunny, so hopefully we'll get back on schedule tomorrow.  Hopefully we'll have a normal finish on Sunday.
