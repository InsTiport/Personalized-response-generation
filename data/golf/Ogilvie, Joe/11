  Q. Just start with some general comments about your round.   
 JOE OGILVIE: I hit the ball extremely well. I wouldn't want more than two shots over. I would like a lot of putts over.   
 But I played extremely well and this is a tournament when you got it going, you got to go low. And unfortunately I went, I had a pretty good round of 66, but it could have been a pretty special round, I think. It could have been a 62, 61, 63, somewhere in there.   
  
  Q. Eagle on number 8, correct?  
 JOE OGILVIE: Yeah, eagle on number 8.   
 Then I proceed to miss it from six feet on 9.   
 Nine feet on 10.  
 Six feet on 11.  
 I miss it from 14 feet for eagle on 13.   
 I hit it close every single hole. There really wasn't a -- it was a fun round to play because it was a very, very easy 66.   
  
  Q. Details on the eagle on number 8?  
 JOE OGILVIE: I hit driver and a great 5-wood to about -- I had about 235. I hit 5-wood to seven feet. So that was good.   
 Then I just played -- I kept it right in front of me and played solid from there.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like with the conditions out there today you had an opportunity to score well?  
 JOE OGILVIE: I did. Especially with lift, clean, and place. But the scores were a little bit lower than I expected, to be honest. I expected a little bit higher scores.   
 But then again these guys are awful good when you get the ball in your hand and get soft conditions and the greens are running perfect, then they're always going to shoot pretty low.
