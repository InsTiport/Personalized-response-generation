Q. Talk about the round.  Obviously moving up the leaderboard there, getting some birdies.
JOE OGILVIE:  Well, it was a good round.  I played solid.  Tomorrow we'll wake up early and see if I can shoot 65, 63, 64.

Q.  Second week in a row you've had a good first round.  You had the lead last week, and right there and have chance to take it again this week.
JOE OGILVIE:  Yeah, it's always nice to start off well.  You cannot win the first day, so I just have to play solid.  The course is pretty soft.  They're going to shoot 20 under this week, so I'm going to have to have a lot more 6 unders, but it's a good start.

Q.  What was really working for you out there?
JOE OGILVIE:  Pretty much everything.  I'm hitting the ball well, driving it well, putting it well.  I really didn't have that many opportunities to make bogey except for the last hole.  It's all together and I'm hitting it solid.
