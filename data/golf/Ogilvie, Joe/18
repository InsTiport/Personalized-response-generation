  Q. Can you just talk about how the course is playing today?   
 JOE OGILVIE: Well, I think the course played on par a tick easier today. The wind was probably down five miles an hour. So you could get it close to a few of the pins, but it's still playing pretty difficult.   
 I think we didn't have the ball in hand today, lift, clean and place, so that made it a little bit more difficult. But it's a tough golf course. You see 5-under leading and 3-under in second. It's difficult.  
  
  Q. The redesign of 18, are you approaching this a little differently?  
 JOE OGILVIE: Well, before you didn't have in the trouble in the second shot really. You had a bunker, but no one really cares about bunkers. Now on the second shot you've got water all up the left side, so you've got to be a hell of a lot more careful.   
  
  Q. Looking to tomorrow, any idea how you're going to approach tomorrow as opposed to today?   
 JOE OGILVIE: You know, this is the kind of course, there's not a whole lot of letup, especially with 20 mile-an-hour winds. You kind of have to play it shot by shot and get the ball in the fairway.   
 And then No. 2, you're hitting these greens with 20 mile-an-hour crosswinds. It's a golf course that's playing pretty tough.
