Q.   Talk about that.   That must have been thrilling. 
JOE OGILVIE:   Particularly thrilling because I bogeyed the 15th hole, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, well, I'm probably going to bogey 18, so somehow I've got to make par on 16 and 17 or birdie.   But no, I hit a great 7‑iron in there and actually cut it the way you're supposed to hit a golf shot.   It was nice.   I think I lipped out on 14 for birdie.   6‑iron, same shot.

Q.   Since it was tucked behind the bunker you couldn't see it go in?
JOE OGILVIE:   Couldn't see it, but where my ball mark was, where the ball ended up, if it didn't hit the cup, it had to be pretty close.

Q.   How many is that for you now?
JOE OGILVIE:   Ten.   I haven't won anything.
