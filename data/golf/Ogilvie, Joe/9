 Q. (When asked about how he played today.)
 JOE OGILVIE: Normally when you shoot 4-under you're not too disappointed, but I'm fairly hot right now. I double bogeyed the 17th hole due to stupidity. I finished 4-under and it should have been 6-under. 

 Q. (When asked about his goal for the day.)
 JOE OGILVIE: My goal was to shoot 10-under here (at La Quinta Country Club) and at SilverRock, and I shot 8-under, so I'm not that far off. I need about 8-under tomorrow and it's out there. 

 Q. (On the double bogey on 17.)
 JOE OGILVIE: We didn't know the yards to the trees. We guessed and my caddie was 30 yards off. I should have hit 3-wood instead of driver. I hit it right and had to draw the ball hard around a tree from there and I hit it OB. 
 I had uncertainty on the tee and it's a mistake to hit driver when you're not confident of your through-line and you're not confident standing there. 
 I was OB on my second shot and I deserved to be OB. I hadn't made a bogey in a long time and you can't have double bogeys and win the Hope.
