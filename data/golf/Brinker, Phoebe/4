Q. Your goals coming into this week were obviously to win probably, but what were they?
JENNIFER CLEARY: First was to make the cut.
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah. 

Q. Which you did. 
JENNIFER CLEARY: Yeah. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Delaware (indiscernible) made the cut before. 
JENNIFER CLEARY: Yeah, they used to be like in the hundreds and then they decided to bring the young kids. (Laughter.) 

Q. Today with the format it was kind of tough to know where you were. Did you know how close you were to the lead all day?
JENNIFER CLEARY: Not really. I think we both were just trying to go play well and see what happens. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, definitely.

Q. The course changed with all the weather. How did the course play compared to the first two days?
PHOEBE BRINKER: It was definitely wetter today, and especially because we had to go finish in the morning.
JENNIFER CLEARY: The greens were still nice, though. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, they're.

Q. I believe you had an eagle today?
PHOEBE BRINKER: I did. 

Q. Tell me about that. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: So it was to the downhill par‑5, and I hit a good driver, good 4‑iron. I made a pretty tough putt for like 25‑footer, so that was good.
I just had a double a few days before, so it felt good to make that up. 

Q. I think I heard somebody say it's not often this Delaware beats Florida in sports. 
JENNIFER CLEARY: No. 

Q. Pretty proud moment?
JENNIFER CLEARY: So we're going to take it and run. (Laughter.)

Q. Phoebe, you played great individually. Just two strokes behind the leader. How does it feel to be that close? 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Really good, yeah. I played really solid all three days, so that felt good. 
Then with Jen shooting a 67 the second day, that definitely boosted us up the leaderboard. That felt good.

Q. Were any of you on the team last time, 2015?
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, all three of us.

Q. Do you remember where you finished that time? 
JENNIFER CLEARY: We did not make the cut. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah. 

Q. So quite a change. What's next for all of you?
PHOEBE BRINKER: We're going Georgia next.
JENNIFER CLEARY: Yeah.
PHOEBE BRINKER: But, yeah, exciting.

Q. Second place, but still pretty proud of the accomplishment?
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
