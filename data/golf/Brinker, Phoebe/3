Q. I think a little one point there was a four‑way tie for first. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Uh‑huh. 

Q. And you must have had to be sitting there thinking, okay. You guys were in a perfect spot there. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, I tried not to think about it too much. I thought about it a little bit the last few holes, but I just tried to stay relaxed and just play. 

Q. Once you guys are done and obviously got to wait, what's it like sitting there?
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, it was tough like just watching and hoping and just hoping to get a good finish. But we were still proud of the way we played definitely.
Like we knew that we played our best, so where ever we finished was fine.

Q. (Regarding the weather.)
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah, I was surprised about the greens a lot. They were still really fast. But they did a really good job of keeping the course dry. 

Q. A little unusual. I mean, typically in New Mexico it's not this type of weather.
PHOEBE BRINKER: Yeah. That's what everyone said. Yeah, of course we got the week, but, you know, it's okay. 

Q. That's all I needed it. 
PHOEBE BRINKER: Thank you.
