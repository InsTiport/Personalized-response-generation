Q. Just tell me a little bit about the round and how you're feeling out there.
PHOEBE BRINKER:   It was a very up-and-down day.  I started off pretty well, and then the girl I was playing against, Austin, had three birdies in a row.  So it got a little tough out there.  I was 1-down, but I just tried to stay calm.
Q. Was there a hole that the momentum kind of changed for you?  Was there a big shot you hit?
PHOEBE BRINKER:   Yes, hole 13, I ended up parring and then she ended up missing a short putt, so that's kind much where the momentum switched from, her winning all the holes to me finally winning a hole.
Q. It was 2&1 you finished at?
PHOEBE BRINKER:   Yeah.
Q. Were there any other big birdies that you had?
PHOEBE BRINKER:   I actually didn't have any birdies.  I basically had all pars all day, which I mean, that got me the win today, but I'm definitely going to make birdies in my future matches.
Q. Grinding out a win like that, does that give you some momentum tomorrow?
PHOEBE BRINKER:   Absolutely.  I was hitting it very well.  The putts just didn't can the drop today, so I'm looking for the to the next matches.
Q. What's been your favorite part of the week so far?
PHOEBE BRINKER:   Just meeting all these different people.  Just being here so close to home at a golf course.  So great.  It's been a great week.
