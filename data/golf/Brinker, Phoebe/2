  Q. You've seen the course a few times now.  Talk about how it suits your eye.
 PHOEBE BRINKER:   It's really good for my game driving-wise.  I hit the ball pretty far with a draw, so I have a lot of shorter irons in, so I've been able to be aggressive.
 Q. Talk about just the experience so far at the Women's Am in what is a very odd year.
 PHOEBE BRINKER:   It's been such a good experience, especially being so close to home.  It was such an easy drive here, and I had a member at my club say "hi".  So it's just been a great experience being so close to home.
 Q. How much golf have you been able to play recently?
 PHOEBE BRINKER:   I played the North South, so only one tournament before this.  But quite a bit just because there's nothing else to do.
 Q. Is it it's a long week at the Women's Am, obviously.  This is the first step.  How do you prepare and stay focused for a tournament this long?
 PHOEBE BRINKER:   The day off yesterday was kind of nice just to rest.  But I'm just looking forward to the week.  I've never made the cut at the Women's Am before, so I'm very excited.
 Q. What did you do with your off day yesterday?
 PHOEBE BRINKER:   Well, I actually ended up breaking my laptop, so we went to the Apple store to get it fixed and we explored Georgetown.
