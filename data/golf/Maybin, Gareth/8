  GARETH MAYBIN:   Played okay, putted well to start with.   Then kind of got a little bit tentative coming in, but all in all, 4‑under, pretty good score.

Q.   Got to go in with those birdies,4 and 6? 
GARETH MAYBIN:   I guess 4‑under, didn't drop a shot all day, which I was quite pleased.

Q.   And that lovely little chip at the bunker that caught the pin?
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, I couldn't believe how firm it bounced actually.   As soon as I played it, I thought it was going to be really close, and then the end I was lucky to kind of hit the flag. 

Q.   This kind of course, something that you favour I presume?
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, definitely.   It's a little shorter, more fiddly.   I'm not a bomber, so the shorter and tighter it is, the better. 
It was tricky, I got a good draw, the wind kind of died in the last hour. 

Q.   Pretty cold?
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, it's okay.   Not compared to back home, but it's cold for Hong Kong.

Q.   Compared to what everybody has been used to really in the last few weeks I guess?
GARETH MAYBIN:   That's right.   It's been hot wherever we've gone so it's nice to experience a little bit of colder weather.

Q.   I have to ask about your state of mind given your position?
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, same as every other week, just go out and post the best number.   Doesn't change too much to be honest.   Keep doing what I've done over the years and see where it puts me at the end of the week.
