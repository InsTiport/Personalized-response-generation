Q.   Tell us about the hole‑in‑one.
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, I had 199, it was playing a hair downwind and it was a perfect number for my 5‑iron.   Only about ten yards short, rolled up and went in. 

Q.   Saw it all the way? 
GARETH MAYBIN:   Saw it all the way.   Went a bit crazy on the tee but why not.

Q.   And with playing partners, because I doubt there were that many people around at that time of day?
GARETH MAYBIN:   Yeah, just us playing, it was fun.   There were a few people watching, ten or 12, not very many.

Q.   And you get yourself a nice little bonus for the hole‑in‑one. 
GARETH MAYBIN:   Looking forward to seeing it.   I believe it's a watch, looking forward to it.

Q.   I gather, I'm told you wanted an OMEGA watch?
GARETH MAYBIN:   I really wanted one about two years ago, I did well in Korea and went and bought one, looks like I have two now.

Q.   And the Seamaster is worth a pretty penny, as well. 
GARETH MAYBIN:   Not sure how much it's worth but happy to win it.

Q.   Putting it on the scale of holes‑in‑one in your career, I know you've had another one in the past on The European Tour. 
GARETH MAYBIN:   I've had four in total.   I had two this year, one in Holland and one here.   But this definitely is the best one.

Q.   You never tire of it. 
GARETH MAYBIN:   No, definitely not. 

Q.   Go on, put it in the picture of the whole of the round, because it didn't work out well in the end, did it?
GARETH MAYBIN:   No, I played poorly today to be honest.   I did well to shoot 3‑over.   So I have a bit of work this afternoon, and try and regroup and play better at the weekend.

Q.   That double as a result of the hole‑in‑one just straight after? 
GARETH MAYBIN:   No, just two horrific shots. 

Q.   But the big positive, as well as the watch, hey, you've made the cut and you'll have a nice tidy sum of money if you carry on. 
GARETH MAYBIN:   Correct.   Looking forward to the weekend.   Post a couple of good numbers and get one for Christmas.
