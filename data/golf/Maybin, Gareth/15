   GARETH MAYBIN: I played great. Putting well. Not driving well so maybe do a bit of work on that this afternoon, straighten that out and maybe have a chance tomorrow. Nothing to lose, I'm a no-name up there. So go out tomorrow and if I play well, I play well; and if not, I go home for Christmas.
 On the 18th green there, the whole gallery is around you, and it's brilliant. 

 Q. How was your round today? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Played good, just one shopped shot. It was breezy out there, so it was tricky. Played very well. The greens are starting to firm up a bit but still rolling pretty pure. 
 Just all in all, played very solid.

 Q. Any spectacular birdies, monster putts, any of that? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Nothing, I think the biggest birdie putt I made was 15 feet, so played pretty solid. Irons are pretty good.
