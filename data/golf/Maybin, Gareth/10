   GARETH MAYBIN: It's been pretty good. Didn't really come in here with a whole lot of form, so to finish second is a great result any time. I didn't play the back nine great, to be honest, 3-over, so a few things there that need a bit of improvement but overall happy enough. 

 Q. What was that down to? Very tricky, the conditions out there?
 GARETH MAYBIN: The back nine is playing a lot harder than the front with a different wind today. But missed a couple of short putts, missed a couple early, too, so maybe just go back and work on my putting next week and a little bit of technique work and come back. 

 Q. How conscious are you of leaderboards? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Very; I watch them all the time. When I turned at 11-under, I figured I was tied for the lead or one back. I was a little disappointed to bogey 10, but bounced back with a nice little birdie there on 13, great shot into 14. 
 You know, I hit a lot of good shots, some bad shots. All in all, probably got what I deserved.

 Q. Never a good time for a bogey but that just hit you when you get it the momentum in your favour, must have just been so galling?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, I hit a pretty poor wedge shot. It was easy, actually. I had 110; probably playing 120, perfect wedge, back stop, just come up a little short but that's the way it goes.

 Q. I gather you weren't particularly well overnight?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, a little upset stomach, but going to go have a cup of beer and celebrate my second place finish. 

 Q. Well out of your system by the time you played?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, I was fine. 

 Q. Next ... Spain? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: No, not playing Spain. I'll go to Italy. Probably that will be my next outing.
