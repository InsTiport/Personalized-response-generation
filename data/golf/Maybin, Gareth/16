  MIKE GREEN: A good round, why don't you start off by telling us about how you got started in golf. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, played my first round of golf when I was 13, 14, and played mini-tours for two years and a year on the Challenge Tour and got my heart and here I am. 
 MIKE GREEN: A good day, and four birdies in your first nine. What happened on 9? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: I hit a poor tee shot, went in the left bunker. I had a reasonable lie but couldn't bounce it very far, probably got a little greedy and went in the rough and had to hack out and chip on and 2-putt. 
 MIKE GREEN: The birdies made you happy, I bet. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, played well all day, tee-to-green, putted well. When I did miss a green, I got it up-and-down. All in all my game is in pretty good shape.
 MIKE GREEN: Have you had a chance to look at the leaderboard around you? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Not yet. I'm a couple back but tomorrow will kind down and see where I am. 
 MIKE GREEN: How did you find the wind on the course? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: It died down but then it started up again, weird. The middle of my round, it made a little turn, and then the last four or five holes it died down and then it picked up again. 

 Q. First time playing here?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, my first time. Enjoying it a lot. 

 Q. Your first tournament this year?
 GARETH MAYBIN: No, I think my 4th this year. Probably my first one was Hong Kong this week, I came in 24th. 

 Q. Did you realise you were in the lead on the back nine?
 GARETH MAYBIN: I probably did. Anything under you're probably right up there. Yeah, probably did. 

 Q. What would you say is the strongest part of your game?
 GARETH MAYBIN: My short game. I drive it pretty good, too. That's a pretty good combination when you can drive it in the fairway and putt and chip it pretty good. 

 Q. Are you surprised at the --
 GARETH MAYBIN: No, feeling good. I played last week and Hong Kong. It's nice to just take your pick.
