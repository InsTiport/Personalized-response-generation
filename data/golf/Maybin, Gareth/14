 Q. You made a fight of it. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: It was fun, to go out in the last group today and play with Lee, played pretty good golf. 
 Obviously just came up a little bit short on the last but all in all very, very happy with myself and the way I held up. 

 Q. At what point in the round did you really sense that you had it? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: I guess making a few birdies at the start, it's always good to get a couple in early. It boosts your confidence and proves that you really can do it.
 I made a couple of bad bogeys right on the lip. 

 Q. The putts on 18 in regulation just caught the left lip?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, and I just couldn't keep it straight to be honest. I had a reasonable putt but just lagged it a little bit. 

 Q. Good two weeks in South Africa, though. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, enjoyed it. I love this part of the world, Cape Town area. The food is good, and one hell of a golf course, too. 

 Q. Great start to the season. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, Hong Kong, Australia, last two weeks have been pretty good. Looking forward to Christmas now and just starting up again in the new year.
