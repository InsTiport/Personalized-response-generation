   GARETH MAYBIN: I only played one practise round. I like the golf course. The scenery is pretty spectacular.   
  
  Q. Hard to believe it's nine years old.   
 GARETH MAYBIN: It's incredible. It looks like it's been there for a lifetime.   
  
  Q. You look like you've been playing it for a lifetime.   
 GARETH MAYBIN: I putted well and hit a couple close. I played pretty good all day to be honest. New caddie on the bag, so all good.   
 I took two weeks off, did me a world of good. Worked on a few things and made a few things a little better. I changed my putter, changed the grip on my putter and the way I go about putting, my style a bit.   
  
  Q. Putter; caddie; anything else?   
 GARETH MAYBIN: I was going to say my girlfriend but she's still hanging around. (Laughing).  
 Everything feels pretty good and quite relaxed. I don't practise on the links but I have a good feel for it. It was a very enjoyable fourball.
