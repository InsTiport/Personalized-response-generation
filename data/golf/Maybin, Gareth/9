 Q. How good a round was that?
 GARETH MAYBIN: Pretty good. Obviously it's going to take something pretty low to win this week, so to shoot 30 on the back nine was very nice. 

 Q. You're the forgotten man of Northern Irish golf at the minute. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, so everybody keeps telling me. Obviously in a burn at the minute, especially with Michael getting a great win two weeks ago at the Dunhill. Times are strong in the in Northern Ireland.

 Q. Is there a secret? Do you know something that we don't? 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Somebody tells me it's the Guinness. I guess a good crop of players and they are all shining at the moment.

 Q. 110 coming into the week, leading, great start. 
 GARETH MAYBIN: Yeah, any time you shoot 65 is a great start. So taking each round as it comes and trying to shoot the best I can and see where I am at the end of the week.

 Q. You have a buddy on the bag?
 GARETH MAYBIN: A good mate of mine, I've known him all my life really, so came out for a couple of weeks and doing great.
