 Q.   After round two, a par round, some very solid golf in there?  
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, Royal Birkdale, doesn't give you much encouragement.   You have to play really well to shoot level, so I would say that's a really good round.   Could have been a few better.   
Hit a lot of greens.   I think I only missed two greens in regulation, which is obviously very pleasing.   But yeah, putted nicely.   Didn't hole many but putted well which is the main thing.  
   
 Q.   Nice to finish with a birdie at the last?  
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, that's a lovely hole that.   Gives you a chance if you hit a drive‑‑ you have to hit the fairway, though.   6‑iron, and I must have been aiming a bit right because Tanya read it perfect and I just pushed it I think.  
   
 Q.   How are conditions?   Only nine players under par yesterday.   Do you see something similar happening today?   
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Well, and that's in perfect conditions.   You can't play Birkdale two bad days, and we've done and still the scoring's not great.   Shows what a great course it is.   Yeah, the wind gets up this afternoon hopefully and they will have pretty much the same as had, and I can imagine, yeah, not that many people will be getting under.  
   
 Q.   And you think you got the better of the conditions?   
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Well, we had this yesterday and we had the wind in the afternoon.   So like I said, if it picks up I think it's a very fair even split, which is what you always hope for but don't often happen on a links golf course.   
So it would be nice if it did pick up a bit.   That's the nasty side of me coming out.  
   
 Q.   And at plus three, you're well in the cut line at the moment.   So what's the plan for the weekend if you get there, just keep playing some solid golf?   
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   I think we have got it perfect.   We are going to change one club on the fifth, we are going to hit a 3‑iron, not a 2‑iron off the tee and I think the rest of it stays the same because it's working well and I'm swinging well.   You need to make more birdies, obviously, but that's down to if I can just get them just to drop over the next two days because the quality of golf today was pretty good.   I was pleased.  
   
 Q.   What would you say is a winning score?  
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Purely depends on the weather.   If it stays like this, probably someone will get to 8‑, 9‑, 10‑under but I wouldn't imagine 4‑under is not a bad total.   I wouldn't mind shooting 7‑under on the weekend and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   How special is Royal Birkdale to you after winning here in the past?   
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Well, you know, it's been a long time ago now but it was my first big win.   I don't remember any of the shots but I can remember standing in front of that clubhouse with the candlesticks and it was an amazing week for me.   
So, yeah, every time we come back here, I feel like‑‑ I said yesterday, I think this is the fairest of the links courses we play.   If you hit good shots you get rewarded.   There's no tricky bunkers that can get your ball off a slightly miss‑hit shot and it gives you a chance.   But it is still very tough.   
You stand on that first tee, probably one of the hardest first holes in golf I think, and I'm almost playing it as a par 5 because I'm hitting 2‑iron off the tee and if I can get one in the fairway, I can reach but both days I've had to lob one out and luckily made a par today.   That was a good up‑and‑down.   
   
 Q.   Only downside, you come here mainly in the summer when your team are playing in the football season?  
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I got up to the City game which was good fun when that third goal went in for us.   It's just nice being in the area.   Last year I went to the shop.   I don't know if I will this year.   I bought some stuff at the City game.   Obviously holds a great place in my heart.
