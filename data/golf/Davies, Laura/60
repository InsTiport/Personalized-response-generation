  Q. How do you feel about the way it went today?  
 LAURA DAVIES: Obviously disappointed. I've let Becky down today. I didn't hit enough fairways really. I hit two really poor tee shots, and apart from that the good ones were going in the rough, and you can't play this golf course in the rough, and she had no backup.   
 On the other side of it, Brittany Lincicome played great. Sometimes you get beaten.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about the way you played, Becky?   
 BECKY BREWERTON: Yeah, I feel the same. Brittany played fantastic. She put us under pressure from early on, and we just weren't able to do the same thing and get in close enough really and get inside them.   
It's always frustrating. They just put the pressure on us.   
  
  Q. How can you use this match to help you going forward?  
 BECKY BREWERTON: Well, it's just one of those things. You take each match as it comes. You forget about it and get on with it. We know how much it could change. We could both play great tomorrow. You just never know.
