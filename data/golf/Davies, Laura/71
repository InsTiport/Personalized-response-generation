 Q.  How were conditions today? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  We had a great match.  The wind was a little bit of a factor but not too much and then the course has dried out lovely. 

 Q.  How do you feel about match play as opposed to the regular format? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  It's pretty nerve-wracking.  I had to get up-and-down there from a pretty awkward spot and your arms are shaking, your legs are shaking.  It's like winning a mini-tournament.  It's fun but it's a little bit of pressure. 

 Q.  And can you tell us a little bit about playing in Westchester, how do you like the golf out here? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Oh, I like it.  It reminds me of England a little bit so it has that feel to it, lots of big trees.  Yeah, I like it.
