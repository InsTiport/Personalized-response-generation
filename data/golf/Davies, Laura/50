 Q. Clearly not the round you were hoping for, was it a question of lack of sleep and nothing in the tank? 
 LAURA DAVIES: Well, yeah, because we felt a bit rough yesterday I didn't play particularly well, and so I was hoping for a good night's sleep. And then get a phone call at one o'clock this morning and unfortunately could not go back to sleep. 
 You do not like to make excuses, but from the word go, we were in trouble here. And did really well to shoot level on the front, and then made a ridiculous double-bogey on 10 and then it was a real struggle. And to be honest, 3-over is not a bad effort.

 Q. Concentration obviously the main difficulty when you're feeling tired?
 LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, just a lot of travelling, it caught up with me. I'm not as young as I used to be. That phone call was a nightmare really and that really put us behind the 8-ball. 
 You can never give up. I know I'm eight behind that and six behind second. It's not the end of the world, yet. We'll see how we go tomorrow. Have to shoot 5- or 6-under the next three days, every day, so that's what I've got to try and do.

 Q. I loved the way you played the 18th hole: You just take it by the throat and strangle it. I was comparing you to Phil Mickelson. He said to me earlier in the year that he thinks the reason he's won so many golf tournaments is he takes chances. Yes, he loses tournaments because of it sometimes, but he wins many more times. Do you feel the same way?
 LAURA DAVIES: That's exactly the same way. I've lost tournaments in the past and probably people have criticised me for it, but at the end of the day, shots like that win you tournaments. And Phil is exactly right. His biggest letdown was obviously that U.S. Open; maybe once should have played safer. 
 On a hole like that, if you are long enough, I actually didn't think I hit a particularly good drive. Actually had to hit a provisional, hit that worse than I hit if the first one but I had carried the tree and it was in perfect position. Only had a 9-iron in there. It is sort of a risky tee shot but the reward is too big not to go for it. 

 Q. Think there's a low one out there for you tomorrow?
 LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, I just -- touch wood, I cannot play that badly again. I hit two good shots today and that's just not in good enough, when you're in contention, not just trying to win a wig major tournament but trying to win the Money List, that is very disappointing. Sleep or no sleep, that was unfortunately.
