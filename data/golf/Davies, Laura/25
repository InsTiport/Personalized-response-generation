 Q.  Laura, that was pretty much just the start you're after, second place in the clubhouse, good start?  
LAURA DAVIES: Very good, yeah.  Played solid.  Missed a few greens out there but you're going to do that because if you miss the fairways, you're going to get into some tough lies.  Got up and down all but one time.  One bogey, five birdies, a good day.   
 Q.  The contrast couldn't be greater where you were last week to this week, different temperature, totally different golf course.  How do you get into the groove when you arrive?  
LAURA DAVIES: We all know this course.  This is the ninth year I've been here, 10th year of the tournament.  You pretty much know what you're going to get.  They made some changes, the bunkers are deeper and a lot more difficult if you get in them.  That's one thing you have to adapt to.  But the rest of the course is pretty much how it always is, beautiful.   
 Q.  Feeling pretty good coming into this week?  
LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, I feel like it's a course I should do well on.  The first few years, I think I finished second, third and fourth.  Since then I've had some missed cuts and average finishes.  It's a course I would like to think I could do well on.  This is a good start but that's all it is, a good start.   
 Q.  Happy with the round?  
LAURA DAVIES: 27 putts, that's the difference.  I've been playing like this and shooting level, 1 over.  Today, because I putted so nicely, I shot 4 under.  This is what we are working towards.  If we can keep this up, then we'll be competitive again.   
 Q.  Any putt that really stands out from today?  
LAURA DAVIES: Well, I holed three really nice putts.  A really good one on the    it would have been the par 3 seventh, which was my 16th hole, and that was about 25 feet downhill.   
And there was a really good one on No. 1.  I was pin high right, probably 30 feet and holed that.  Two lovely putts there.  It was the ones from three, four, five feet for par that I made today.
