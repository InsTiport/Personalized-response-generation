Q.  What a dominating team of Laura Davies and Suzann Pettersen.  First time you guys have been paired up.

Laura, you were awesome on the Front 9 today?

LAURA DAVIES:  I played pretty well.  When you've got a partner like that backing you up, you aren't going to get any bad shots.  If she needs me to back her up, I'm there; and if I need her to back me up, she's there.
Q.  You had six birdies on the Front 9, five on your ball.  Your game seems totally complete right now?

LAURA DAVIES:  It's going pretty well.  I think I holed three times.

Suzann had putts inside mine.  If I putt well, I normally score very well.  Solheim Cup brings the best out in my putting.
Q.  Suzann, you won four points last time.  What is it about this format that really brings you to another level?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I don't know, I like fighting and keeping the spirit up.  With our team, we make it happen.  If I do my job and the rest do their job, we might have The Cup on Sunday.  Just take one shot at a time, and playing with Laura is just fantastic.
Q.  The way you two played today, I don't think anyone could have beat you.  Congratulations.
