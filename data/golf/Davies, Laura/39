 Q.   Did you watch Solheim?   
LAURA DAVIES:   I was commentating.   I saw 35 hours of it, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Was it a difficult experience?   
LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, it's pretty unusual, because obviously 23 years of my life has been Solheim Cup golf.   Yeah, it wasn't much fun in the beginning of the week, but once it all started and we started winning, it became more and more enjoyable.   I think if we had lost, you would have thought that more could have been done better (Indiscernible).   
   
 Q.   From the sounds of things, it sounds like you're playing fine?  
LAURA DAVIES:   I'm good, yeah.  
   
 Q.   You're going to keep going for a long time?   
LAURA DAVIES:   I'm going to keep winning.   I need two more points to get into the Hall of Fame.   That is the number one job.   I don't think anybody apart from myself thinks I can do it, and that includes my family.   I still have more wins in me.   Until I'm physically making a fool of myself, I'm still playing.  
   
 Q.   Great playing over the last two days.   What's been the key to your game?   
LAURA DAVIES:   I'm holing putts.   That's the difference.   I think I had 27 today and I had 30 yesterday, and that is probably something like 13 putts less than I've had the last two weeks when I missed the cut by a shot or two shots.   You know, you can't compete if you can't hole putts.
