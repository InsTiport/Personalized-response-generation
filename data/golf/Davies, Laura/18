 Q.  It's Laura Davies' 32nd year out here, but you're playing like a rookie.  Beautiful round of 9-under today.  What was the key?  
LAURA DAVIES: Just solid golf.  Hit it close enough and hole some really good putts.  On greens as beautiful as this you have to be making your putts, and that's what happened today.   
 Q.  You have to love coming back to Phoenix.  It was here, on the other side of the valley, that you won four times in a row.  What kind of mojo and good feelings do you get from coming to the Valley of the Sun?  
LAURA DAVIES: I just love it because the galleries, they're getting older with me and they are still coming out and watching.  It's always a good atmosphere in Phoenix.  You really enjoy the event and the course is always immaculate.   
Like I said, the greens are beautiful to putt on.  The whole event is just really well done.   
 Q.  They always say beware of the hurt golfer.  What is going on with your left ankle?  It's your Achilles, right?  
LAURA DAVIES: It was originally my Achilles and they've been helping me in the trailer and now it's moved into the calf muscle.  My left leg has always been weak.  The knee was bad last year and that stopped me from playing a couple of events.   
It's just getting older.  That's the thing.  Don't get old.   
 Q.  You okay for tomorrow?  
LAURA DAVIES: I'll crawl 'round if I have to.   
 Q.  What a round.  Talk us through it.  What was working so well for you?  
LAURA DAVIES: I was driving it nicely, which you have to do because you don't need to be in the desert.  There are a lot areas where you can get into trouble.   
But hit lots of fairways and gave myself some really good birdies chances and holed them.  That was the key.  I did actually miss a couple short ones.  You're always greedy.  One more.   
But 9-under on a Saturday, you can't ask for much more.   
 Q.  The think the folks in the media center were saying it's the lowest round you've had on the LPGA since '06.  Where did that come from?  
LAURA DAVIES: Well, my putting is improved no end, and my ball striking has always been pretty solid.  My putting has been letting me down for the last four, five, six, years.  I changed to the claw grip in Arkansas last year, so that was sort of July last year.  And I've started to hole some putts.   
I had seven birdies yesterday.  I had seven birdies and an eagle today.  It's all about the putting, because everyone can play.  It's whether you can get the putts to fall in the hole when you give yourself a chance.   
 Q.  We talked a couple days ago about really wanting to win another tournament and you feel like you really can.  You ready to go chase this tomorrow?  
LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, if you look at the leaderboard now I'll probably be four, five behind going into tomorrow.  If you've had one good round it's hard to back it up, but I'll certainly have a crack at it.  At least I've given myself a chance now.   
 Q.  And how is your Achilles doing?  
LAURA DAVIES: It's a struggle.  It's in the calf, muscle as well now.  And it's walking.  I can swing as hard as I want with no feeling at all, but every step is just misery.   
 Q.  It's awesome to watch you climb the leaderboard.  Congrats.  
LAURA DAVIES: Thank you.   
 Q.  Was it fun on 18 to look up and see your name at the top?  
LAURA DAVIES: Well I said to my caddie, Jeez, I haven't been on top of the leaderboard for a long time.  Yeah, that's nice obviously.  You got to stay there.  That's the biggest challenge.   
 Q.  Tell us about the eagle.  
LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, hit an okay drive.  Hit a little bit too far right and didn't get any run.  Hit into the slope, and then hit a lovely rescue up to about six feet and rolled him in.
