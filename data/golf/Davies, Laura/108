LAURA DAVIES: Birdie on 3, hit 3-iron off the tee and wedge to about 25 feet and holed
the putt. Birdie on 5, hit a driver and 3-wood about 25 feet from the hole, but just off
the edge. Hit sort of a clumsy chip about eight feet past the hole but the putt coming
back for birdie. Then I think it was pars all the way from there until we got to No. 12,
hit a 3-iron off the tee and then I got this neat set of irons and since I have had them
the 7-iron, every time we take the 7-iron out, it goes straight to the flag. I said to
Paul I am going to hole one of these things. Sure enough, picked the 7-iron up and holed
the shot (inaudible) - made 164 to the pin. That was obviously very nice. Next hole, hit a
good drive; left myself 100 yards with a sand wedge; nearly holed that too. That sort of
spun across the hole; left myself about a 6-footer, made that. 15, good drive, and 5-iron
to about 25 feet, actually hit a good putt for eagle; misread it a little bit and tapped
in for birdie. 5-iron. 16, flew it in the hole, but it didn't stay there. Should have
driven it to the casino. (laughter).

Q. What new clubs? What did you switch from?

LAURA DAVIES: The new model of Marumann irons, the old narrow conductors to the new
Titleist, I like them. But the 7-iron, for some reason, it really is unbelievable. Every
time we stand over it, we hit it straight down the point. Well, not every time, that is an
exaggeration, but a lot of the times.

Q. What are you using off the tee?

LAURA DAVIES: A lot of drivers. I'd say a good eight, nine drivers then about four,
five 3-irons.

Q. What is the trouble on this course?

LAURA DAVIES: Reading the greens. We are really struggling. I started out yesterday and
then Paul came in at the end of yesterday; then this morning he started off; then I
chucked him off the greens again and I tried again and he tried again and towards the end
he tried again; neither of us could read them. We read it the same. We just could not -- I
think we hit some good putts out there, but you read it sort of an inch from the left; it
goes five inches left. It is hard.

Q. At what point does a lead become very difficult to catch out here?

LAURA DAVIES: Oh, I don't think you'd ever give up because just the mere fact that
someone is going so low for two days it is very unusual for them to go really low for four
days. At some stage she won't shoot 6-, 7-under so that is the day then myself, Juli, or
Karrie or someone that is up there has to shoot 6-, 7-under to bridge the gap. Obviously
she is playing very, very well and everything she must be holing a few putts. But I
certainly won't give up until -- I know when I have got a six-shot lead with five holes to
play, I am not comfortable. Although you don't think that would be a good chance, you just
never know. So we will just see what happens. Long way to go. 36 holes, only halfway
there.

Q. This seems like a course you'd make up a lot of ground?

LAURA DAVIES: Exactly. All the par 5s are on. There is four chances. Then if you hole a
shot that is a fifth chance. I mean, it is all out there. Just got to hole some putts.
Yesterday we shot 71 that could have been 66. Today we shot 66 that could have been 62. So
we are leaving some out there. I am sure everyone else is as well. Apart from probably Se
Ri, she is probably making most of her chances. She will be hard to beat. She knows what
she is doing. She is good.

Q. Does this course fit her?

LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, anyone who hits the ball with a high ball flight, this would be
perfect because the greens are quite firm, and you can -- if you land to get in there with
a flat trajectory, there is absolutely no chance of stopping it. I think that will suit
her and Juli and myself and Karrie - the ones that are on the top of the leader board. It
is pretty much a ball-strikers course because the 5s are on, but you have to be able to
carry water on all of them.

Q. They are about three or four of you that are quite similar in score right now, but
Se Ri is way ahead of everybody else. She must no how to read the greens.

LAURA DAVIES: Well, maybe her and Jeff are doing a good job on the greens and the rest
of us aren't. Like I say, it is hard to maintain. She might -- she might shoot 26-under,
who knows. But chances are she will probably stop it around 17 or 18. So, you know, the
weekend I have got to shoot 12-under to even get close. At least I know what I am going to
do.

Q. You have had tournaments where you had good scores for four rounds and shot really
well. What does it take to sustain the kind of pace that --

LAURA DAVIES: I think easy par 5s. Reachable par 5s are the only way I have ever --
that is when I really get hold of a course is when the par 5s are like the ones around
here where you can reach them all and you can get yourself away from the field if you play
the par 5s well. So far I haven't really done very well on them. I mean, yesterday I was
level on them. And today I think I was only one -- only 2-under on them today. I am
2-under par on the par 5s and I am 7-under all over. If someone told me that, I would say,
no, that is not possible. So I need to step it up on the par 5s if I am going to figure in
the outcome.

Q. What is the most club you are hitting into those par 5s?

LAURA DAVIES: Just the fifth is the longest. I mean, I hit a drive today 310 yards and
still hit 3-wood into it. So that is genuine par 5. The others I hit 4-iron, 4-iron,
5-iron. And yesterday I hit 6-iron; I didn't have a chance on 9 because of that tee shot.
But I hit 7-iron into 15 yesterday.

Q. So you are hitting less than 3-iron...

LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, I mean, if I get a driving -- you are looking for eagle not birdie.
You walk off with birdie, you are disappointed. 

Q. 5 is a genuine par 5, what are the rest--

LAURA DAVIES: Long par 4s, pretty much what they are. I mean, 9, if you -- there is a
ridge on No. 9, I don't think any of the other players have found it. But I have found it
and I use it every year, it is nice, it is out to the right. It just gives you a clear
shot; takes the ditch out a little bit. Everyone else lays out down the lefthand side. The
people like Karrie and Se Ri, if they sent it over the house on the right-hand side they
would have the same shot I am coming in. But none of them seem to have figured that one
out yet.

Q. Are you risking getting it out-of-bounds there?

LAURA DAVIES: No, you could hit it out-of-bounds there but it would be a very poor tee
shot; then you'd take it on the chin if you hit a poorer shot at that, but at the end of
the day if I can -- if I hit four tee shots down the right, the longest club I will be
going in with will be a 4-iron in there.

Q. End up in the fairway or the rough there?

LAURA DAVIES: It is a strange part. It is neither rough nor fairway, it is just a
little bit of gently rolling ground with a couple of little wispy trees out there. I don't
know what it is. If you look at it, it is a strange little bit of ground, but it is
perfect for where I am driving it. And if I can hit the car path, which I did last year, I
would hit 9-iron (laughter) -- that is the line, I am serious. I hit it down the car path.
If I can just catch it, then I am going in with a 9-iron.

Q. You purposefully trying to hit the cart path?

LAURA DAVIES: Absolutely. I am not joking. It is in the perfect spot. Before that today
I had to take a drop off it, but I just missed it.

Q. Was there any danger of hitting the cart path and it going foul?

LAURA DAVIES: Always a chance of that. You never know.

Q. Take that chance?

LAURA DAVIES: Absolutely. Give me a 9-iron into a par 5, I will take that chance. Roll
the dice.
