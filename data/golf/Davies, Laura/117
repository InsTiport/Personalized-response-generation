LAURA DAVIES:  It wasn't great golf, but it was great match-play.  One of us would win a couple of holes and then give one away and then the other one would give you one back.  It was just sheer nerves and pressure.  I mean, I 3-putted number 12 having just really dodged two bullets on 10 and 11 and now I gave one back.  So, I mean, it's just one of those matches. And then my shot into the 17 went into the back and then Pat pulls off what I can only consider a great bunker shot.  You just have to take your hats off to that and you come down the loss and you hope for the best and, luckily, for me, that tee shot was in a dreadful spot -- but even then, there is an added pressure just to even hit the green and then you've got to 2-putt.  It was just -- the whole thing was pure pressure and that was a lot of relief when that putt went in because I knew it was a hard putt and the ball is not looking too clever at the moment because we're 2-5 down -- too far down in the other matches.  We're winning enough, but we're just losing the others too comfortably.  It's not looking great, but you never know. 
 

Q.  You don't need too much time to knock it in. Do you even think about it?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  Well, yeah.  I just -- I wanted to hit a solid putt.  I just wanted to hit a solid putt inside left and that's what I did and it went in.  I haven't been putting great this year, so that was a really good putt for my confidence and, obviously, a point for the team is what it's all about. 
 

Q.  How many feet?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  I'd say it was about 3 feet, 3 and-a-half feet. 
 

Q.  How do you feel, physically?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  I want to play.  You know what, I don't want to watch and I know all the others want to play and I'm lucky in that, hopefully, I can take my name to the tee a little bit with me and I think that's  why I get all five games.  Luckily, the captain thinks that way and that's what I love.  I would support, like the other players have been supporting all week, but I'd rather be playing.  There's no question. 
 

Q.  Do you like to get out there first?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  Well, if the captain wants me out first, I'll go out first.  I'm not a huge fan of going off -- in this particular situation, we had to go strong early.  We had all our power at the top -- and not against anyone at the bottom.  Lisa Hackney has had one of the best years of all of us and she is proving that by picking up an easy game at the moment.  So I think the captain's strategy was right. I just wish just a couple of those down matches could make a little one and we'd have a chance. 
 

Q.  Do you learn something from event to event like this or from playing in previous matches like this?  Do you learn to pace yourself or your emotions?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  No, you learn that it gets more and more nerve-racking and you know you've only got -- not got too many SOLHEIM CUPs in you -- maybe 3 or 4 for me -- but you just want to pick up all the points you can for the team.  It just gets harder and harder out there.  I felt dreadful on the 18th fairway, I putt a 9-iron in my hand, I could hit it with my eyes closed normally. And, you know, it was a pathetic bump and run into the middle of the green.  It did the job, but it was not exactly a beautiful site. 
 

Q.  Would you call this match ugly?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  It was great match-play match. It wasn't great golf as in ball-striking and everything.  We were the first two out and I think we had a lot of nerves, seeing as though we were the first two out.  That sets you off early.  Although you're pretty happy to be out there and away and you haven't got to stand around any longer, it is very, very nerve-racking. 
 

Q.  (Inaudible).
 
LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah, it is.  You know -- the first four of us -- what is it -- me, Alfie, Annika, and Lisalotte -- basically had to win and, luckily, so far we're all doing pretty well.  We just need Lotta to come through now which it looks like she's doing and then -- well, Trish has been a few down now, which is a  disappointment. 
 

Q.  Do you find yourself watching the score board?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  You can't help by notice it was mainly blue for a while there and, actually, it still may be blue, to be fair.  The trouble is I've seen too many 2-ups, 3-ups on the red numbers. 
 

Q.  Are you normally a scoreboard watcher --
 
LAURA DAVIES:  Oh, yeah.  I want to know what's going on at all times, no question.  I don't understand people who don't want to know. 
 

Q.  Do you find match-play -- does it add any pressure to you, do you think?
 
LAURA DAVIES:  Not at all.  A couple of other players came up to me on 15 and said, Oh my God, it looks like we're in with a chance now and I said, Well, I'm just thinking about my match now.  At that point, on the 15th, when I'd given her the 14th so stupidly, I wasn't interested in anything anyone else was doing because it was my fault and Alfie doesn't win hers. We're pretty much done, anyway. 
 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DAVIES:  I consider that a complete insult.
