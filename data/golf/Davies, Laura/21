 Q.  Are you pleased with what you produced today?  
LAURA DAVIES: Well, yeah, apart from the last three holes, I hit one bad shot on those three holes and ended up -- well, the third shot into 17 was a poor shot, too.  Up until then, I was cruising.   
I had three 3-putts on the back nine, one on a par 5 and my two dropped shots were just 3-putts.  So I haven't even missed a green, and then that's just a kick in the teeth, that finish.   
 Q.  It was the back nine with the struggles yesterday and it would have been on the back nine again today.  Is it coincidence, or does it get tiring out there?  Is it tough conditions to play?  
LAURA DAVIES: No, it's just basically you're playing the front nine downwind and the back nine into the wind and it's just a lot, lot harder.  You have to hit really precise tee shots and you end up not hitting it to 15, 20 feet.  You end up hitting it to 30 and 40 feet.   
I hit a really good tee shot off 16 and hit a good 4-iron and ended up 3-putting for a bogey.  Just that's the way the course is.  If you want to have a good number, you've got to go out in 3- or 4-under.   
 Q.  The wind is up a little more from yesterday and it's certainly colder.  How was it playing out there?  
LAURA DAVIES: Like I said, early doors we didn't really capitalise and then yeah, the back nine, if you don't hit it -- if you don't strike it well, you're going to struggle so hopefully it will start raining, as well.  I know that's very mean.  (Laughter).   
 Q.  When you look at the leaderboard, Georgia Hall sitting at the top; you've got players like Jodi Ewart Shadoff, Mel Reid.  Where do you think English women's golf is right now?  
LAURA DAVIES: Well, at the top end of it, it's really good.  Charley Hull won last year, the Tour Championship in America, so that was a great win for her.  I think Mel is going to win one soon in America, which would be great.  At the moment, the top end of it, the English girls are going really well.
