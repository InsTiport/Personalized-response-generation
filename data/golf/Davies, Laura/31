Q.   Leader in the clubhouse in your 30th appearance in this great championship, just reflect on your play this weekend and indeed in your 30th appearance. 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I've played really well all week.   The first day was a bit disappointing because I played better than the score. 
But yeah, certainly getting off to that horrible start yesterday, 3‑over after two and coming back, that was probably one of the best rounds of the year, even though it was only level par, it was a good round.   And obviously conditions today was so much tougher with the wind.

Q.   How hard was it out there? 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   It was tough.   I think the first two holes I hit 2‑iron for my second shot into the first, 3‑iron second shot into the second and that's par 4s, not par 5s.   That's normally a different game. 
It was a lot of long irons.   A 5‑iron into 16 came up short.   So you've got to hit your long irons well out there today.

Q.   As we speak you're in 18th position, but how much better do you think that could be over the coming hours? 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Just depends.   17 and 18 at the moment are playing cross wind and that's where everyone has been making their scores.   If they stay crosswind, it's not an easy birdie.   I struggled in 17, hit it in one of the fairway bunkers and struggled for a par. 
You just don't know.   Certainly if the wind keeps up, which I hope it does, because I'm a nasty person like that.   It would be lovely because obviously I need as much money on the Money List to keep my card in America.   So this could be a good week if I could stay at 18th and get better.

Q.   You're certainly a Dame with game; when is the investiture?   Have you been told when you're going to go to the Palace? 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   No.   What's happened in the past, when the CBE and the MBE I got, they send you some dates and you choose a date and you just hope it's the Queen, because obviously it would be lovely to have her pin the medal on and meet her again.   So we'll wait and see.   Over the next few weeks I'm assuming I'll find out a date.
