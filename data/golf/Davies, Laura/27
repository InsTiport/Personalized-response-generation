Q. How was it out there today?LAURA DAVIES: I played well.  Just had one little accident, but other than that I played great.Q. They told us yesterday that they were going to bring you ladies to your knees today.  Even par is going to be a great score today.  Do you feel pleased with that?LAURA DAVIES: Well, the course is soft.  You expect a U.S. Open course to be really hard and because of the conditions there's not much they can do to stop the ball stopping, and obviously that gives the control back to us. I think even par is a really good round, I'm pleased with it.  But really, truly, the better scores are going be to be 3 and 4-under, probably.Q. Did the course play that much different today than yesterday?LAURA DAVIES: They put a couple of tees back.  One of them was slightly forward.  But to be honest with you, it's played the same.  I really expected a few of the tees to be moved around and play with our minds a little bit, but they haven't done that.  I don't know why.  I guess in some ways it's good. But I'd like to see 16 go forward so you can have a go at driving the green and stuff like that, but it's not happened yet.Q. What are your impressions of Lancaster, Pennsylvania?LAURA DAVIES: I love it, it's nice.  Everyone has been really good, too.  We're staying in a house, we rented a house.  There were six caddies and myself.  I've been doing some cooking.  Met some of the locals down where we're staying.  Everyone is nice.
