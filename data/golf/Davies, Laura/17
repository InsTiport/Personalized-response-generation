Q. Fantastic round today.  What went well?
LAURA DAVIES: Well, the putting.  Overall, the putting's the thing that's turned around the last eight, ten weeks, and that creates birdies, nine birdies, three silly bogeys, but all 3-putts, two of them, one from off the green.
Ball-striking's decent, but it takes the pressure off when you know you don't have to hit it stiff to make a birdie anymore.  So putting, that's all it is.
Q. And tomorrow, you're right up there now?
LAURA DAVIES: Well just depends what Anne does and I think someone is 10, I'm not sure who is 10.  If they get to 13, 14, which they probably will do, because today the back nine is a lot easier.  13 through 18, they can make some hay.  But if they stay on 10, 11, chance.  But if they get to 13, 14, then they have to stuff up and they are obviously playing very well.
Q. All big hitters, though.  Is that this course?
LAURA DAVIES: It is, yeah.  You can take corners on.  Like the first, the big hitters can take the bunker on, no problem.  The second is drivable today and the third is reachable in two.
So yeah, this is a big hitter's course, and it's unusual for us to get one of them.
Q. What would create a good week for you?  What would you walk away happy with tomorrow?
LAURA DAVIES: Well, ultimately, I haven't won for seven years on the regular tour.  Winning, that's the only thing you come here for.  As unrealistic as people probably think it is, I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win.
But yesterday's round kind of scuffled my chances to a certain extent; again, depending on how these girls finish the last few holes.  But if I had just shot a couple 3-under yesterday, then I would be the one at the top of the leaderboard.
I believe I can win.  I'm not saying I will, by a long shot, but if any of the girls are here and don't think they can win, they probably shouldn't be here.
