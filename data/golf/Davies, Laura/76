   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Right now you're in a great position.  You only have that one bogey, an eagle, 5 birdies, and unbelievable play today.  Are the thoughts of winning the whole thing running through your mind right now as you're tied for the lead? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  I'd need two, so this wouldn't do it.  But I mean, this would be a big step towards it.  I just want to win a tournament again.  I think it's been since 2001 in Rochester.  I mean I've won around the world, just not won in the LPGA. 
 The Hall-of-Fame is distant.  I think about it during the year I'd liked to do it.  But in any given week you don't really worry about that.  You've too much else to worry about. 

 Q.  What in your estimation kept you out of the winner's circle here in the U.S.  for the last few years? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Really lack of confidence in the driver.  Back to Europe last year in Switzerland and finished second.  Played really well.  Started driving if better again. 
 Since then I've played really well this year without too much success.  I'm 24th for the Money List and I think I've played a bit better than that.  Today's round is what I've been hoping for rather than the rounds I've had.  I've been shooting a lot of 1, 2-unders, which is not good enough out here anymore. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LAURA DAVIES:  I hit it off the deck.  I think I hit three irons today.  I hit one off the tee today on No. 9.  You got half on one side of the fairway and half on the other.  Not even I shouldn't have said that.  Why did I say that? 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Not really, because we played such short golf courses that it doesn't really -- I mean, I lose maybe 5, 10 yards so it's not that big of a deal.  If I needed length, if we played on 600-, 700-, 800-, 900-yard courses then you would see me trying to get back with the tee.  But I just don't need it because the courses are just so short. 

 Q.  Just doesn't he seem right.  Distance has always been a big advantage for you. 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Not with the Lady's Tour.  It's never been an advantage on the Lady's Tour.  It's always been about straight hitters and good putters.  Men's Tour you need length.  But on our tour you need accuracy and precision irons and you do need to putt really well. 

 Q.  Did you play here last year?  I can't remember. 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yep. 

 Q.  What were your impressions and the amenities here as opposed to some of the other Tour stops?  Is it a pretty good one? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Oh, it's first class.  Last year it was a first-year event.  Obviously the people at Ginn are wanting to put on a good show, and they're certainly doing it.  There won't be many players not wanting to play in this event and the next one up in North Carolina as well. 

 Q.  You and Sherri Turner, a couple veterans.  Kind of close out there obviously. (Indiscernible). 
 LAURA DAVIES:  I feel like I'm young.  That's the thing.  I know I'm 43, but I certainly don't act or feel like it.  Sometimes my left knee gets a bit troublesome.  I get on well with all the younger girls, like Brittany.  I get on really well with her. 
 Nice, nice players out here now.  It's good for the pairing.  Just have a chat with them.  It doesn't seem like I'm old enough to be some of their mothers.  You talk just like friends.  Doesn't seem quite like the age difference I don't think. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Well, I think -- you mean the tournament, the stature of the tournament?  I think it's such an early event in its history, the second year only.  We're already seeing decent galleries.  You've got the lovely big stands around the 18th.  Just makes it that feel like a quality event immediately.  On the first tee we had Nancy Lopez teeing off in front of us with a huge gallery.  I think it's done very well. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts on Annika? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah, I heard about that.  I didn't even know she had a bad back.  Obviously it's not for anybody if Annika is not playing.  Obviously bad and painful for Annika. 

 Q.  (No microphone). 
 LAURA DAVIES:  I think that's coming.  It nearly happened with Lorena.  I think gradually she was going to wear down the points difference, and the inevitably it was going to happen. 
 I haven't spoken to Annika, but I wouldn't have thought she would lose too much sleep over it.  She's done so well for I don't how long.  It's inevitable that eventually someone is going to take over the mantle. 

 Q.  Are you thinking much about the Solheim Cup at this point? 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Not really.  I'm doing really well on the points in Europe.  I hope I'm in it.  But it's in the back of your mind, the Solheim Cup, yeah.  It's not -- I mean, if I do well I get points in the European Tour, but this one wouldn't count for points. 

 Q.  (No microphone). 
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's true.  Really Morgan just won the first major of the year.  What is she, 19, 20?  People want to see her play golf. 

 Q.  18. 
 LAURA DAVIES:  See, 18 years old and she's already won a major.  So there is a lot more to look at on the LPGA.  It's the same as if Tiger had got a month-long injury and a bad back.  Not that people wouldn't watch it, but that's they'd rather see the premium players up there, and Annika is and has been a premium player.  Has been for a long time.
