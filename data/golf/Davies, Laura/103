 DEBBIE EARECKSON:  Let's go over your score card.
LAURA DAVIES:   I birdied No. 4, hit a really nice  -- I played a bit conservatively, a 4-iron off the tee and 8-iron to the green and holed the put.  Missed a good chance on 5.  And 6 hit the best drive of the week, 8-iron to about 6 feet and made that.  And then after that I just did not make a putt. 
Hit a very good driver, 8-iron onto 10, and we got a gust of wind and it came down short.  Not a bad chip, but missed the putt. 
6-iron into the Par 3.  The first putt was about 35, 40 feet, left it short, and missed the next one.  And then had some chances, missed some more.  And then we get to 16.  I wasn't concentrating and hit a poor tee shot, laid up with a 7-iron and missed the putt.  And 3 putted 18 from the back of the green.
DEBBIE EARECKSON:  Questions?
Q.  With Janice having a four-stroke lead going into the round, did you feel like you had to be aggressive?
LAURA DAVIES: I think I did what I had to do.  I birdied 4.  I hit close to 5 and missed the putt.  I eagled 6.  Hit a lovely shot onto 7.  I had a good chance on 8, good chance on 9, and didn't make any of them.  And Janice just wasn't making mistakes.  She played very well. 
I felt 10 onwards, once I bogeyed 10, I was fighting Annika for second place.

Q.  When Janice bogeyed 7, did you think that here is my chance maybe, and then she came back and birdied 8?
LAURA DAVIES: That was the thing.  Exactly like you say, and then I had a birdie putt on 8, and if I made that she had a very hard putt.  Who knows what could have happened.  I missed it and she made it. 
And 9 was disappointing.  I had a fabulous bunker shot to 12 feet.  I left it short.  That's unfortunate on these greens.  It's a lovely surface to putt on. 
But credit to Janice, she didn't give us a chance.  Two decent players chasing her and she never looked back.  She just went forward.

Q.  With her making a birdie on the 1st hole, did that send a message maybe to you all?
LAURA DAVIES: We thought we had to shoot 65, and as it turns out that would have won by a shot.  I don't really think 65 would have been good enough, because I think she would have stepped up to the plate and got one more herself.

Q.  Do you think a lot of other players would have been intimidated with you and Annika right behind her?
LAURA DAVIES: We both did exactly what we had to do.  She responded  -- like I say, I have admiration for her.  Especially Annika, I've sort of had my day a little bit, but Annika is right at the top of her game, and she had a convincing start.

Q.  Did you see Annika ground her club in the hazard?  Did you realize that was a two-shot penalty?
LAURA DAVIES: I saw her do it.  I thought there were two bunkers, a bunker and a little bit of grass and a bunker.  And I said to my caddie, Terry, "Is that two bunkers?"  Because, you know, you don't want to say anything, but on the other hand with it being on TV you can guarantee that apparently the officials saw it and we didn't have to say anything. 

Q.  Have you ever done that before, left it in a bunker and then grounded it?
LAURA DAVIES: Fortunately, I've been lucky over the years.  You do a few silly things, but I don't remember that particular one.  I've seen it done on numerous occasions.

Q.  What do you take from your finish and your play this week in the tournament?
LAURA DAVIES: I'm disappointed I bogeyed the last two holes.  I would have liked to have finished with a couple of birdies.  I should have birdied 16.  And it would have been nice to birdie the last two and finish 10 or 11.  I finished on a low note, bogey, bogey.  But second place, it puts me on the money list.  And it's only the fifth or sixth tournament.   It's early yet.  And second place is nice.
