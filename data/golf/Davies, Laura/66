  Q.  Laura, you've been doing this since 1990.  Still winning points.  You absolutely love it, don't you?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah.  I've played really well today and didn't give Brittany too many chances, which was important to get a point on the board.  I've been trying to keep tabs on the rest of them.  We need a few putts to go in, and that will give us a chance.   
  
  Q.  How was the atmosphere with your match?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  It was good.  Nice atmosphere.  We both played pretty decent golf.   
  
  Q.  The Americans do have the momentum.  What's the key to turning it?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Annika.  If Annika can turn hers around against Morgan -- I think she went 1-down with three to go.  She needs to win.  She doesn't need a half.  She's got to win two of the last three holes.   
  
  Q.  Wish you luck.   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Okay.   
  
  Q.  How important was this match for you to win?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Well, it makes no difference whether I win or not.  It's all whether we get enough points.  We need 14 1/2.  And at this point it doesn't get us to 14 1/2, it's pointless.   
  
  Q.  How sweet will it be to come back to win the Cup?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  It's important.  I came here trying to win five points.  I only got 2 1/2.  That's not enough.  If we lose by a half point or a point, which it's looking like at the moment, I don't know how it's going to turn out.  I'll be disappointed with the week.  This point is irrelevant if you're on a losing team.
