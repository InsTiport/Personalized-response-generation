  Q. Terrific round of golf today.  Was it the fact that you played with Tom last weekend that's really promoted this?
 LAURA DAVIES:   It's made all difference.  Missed the cut, played with Tom, make the cut.  There is that fact.  So what can I do?  Watching everything he did and trying not to do that is really has really worked well for me.
 Q. That's definitely what we were all saying.  We also noticed how good your chipping and short game was particularly sort of around that back nine.  Are you feeling that even though you're more experienced now --
 LAURA DAVIES:   Older.  You can say it.
 Q. Okay.  Even though you're getting older is there one part of your game that has changed or hasn't changed?
 LAURA DAVIES:   I think the nerves have changed.  I stand over shots now that I would have just hit carefree.
 The funny thing is the shot by the -- I don't know what hole it is, the one that's like the long road  hole.  I was behind that bunker.  Because it was such a difficult shot, that concentrates my mind.  Give me a dead straight ship up the green and I really struggle.
 So that's mental, plus the fact the nerve ends aren't quite as good as they used to be when I was younger.  The short game can be hit and miss, which is what probably cost me quite a lot shots.
 Today no bogeys, missed a few greens, and got up and down every time, so that's a real result.
 Q. Well it was a real treat for us.  We were obviously treated to watching Annika play last week, and now we're able to watch you play, too.  Do you feel that watching her play last week now and you still making the cut and doing everything that you're doing, that age really isn't an obstacle in golf, even though we see a lot of young players?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I think obviously the best talent is all the young players, but the silly little bit for us to hang on -- I mean, Annika is a lot younger than me.  She's about seven years younger.
 Yeah, it's fun.  You see Langer go to the Masters and do really well.  That sort of thing, in any mind I think, Well, you know, I'm still a decent ball-striker.  My nerves let me down more than my game.
 So that's why I'm still here playing, because I can hit the shots.  It's just hitting them in the right order.  That's the problem.  I putt really well today and yesterday and that's the ultimate key for me.  I played really well at te end of last year but just didn't hole a putt.
 That's what makes the difference between doing all and not.
