Q.   Do you like hearing, "Dame Laura Davies"?
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, it's one of those things, you don't expect.   Yeah, what an honour.

Q.   Has there been lots of curtsying and hand twirling? 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, that's exactly right. 

Q.   What's the reaction been to this out on the course in the last few hours? 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, it's been nice.   People have always been really nice to me when I play golf in this country but there was a nice little cheer.   I told the starter not to say Dame but he did.   Gave a nice little cheer, lovely little things like that.

Q.   This is an event you have such a lovely affiliation with, 30 years and going strongly.   How did that round compare today?
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Disappointing because I played much better than 3‑over.   I had problems on 16 and 17, off not even that bad of shots.   I pulled a two and thought I hit a perfect drive on 17 but I'm in knee‑high rough making a good bogey in the end. 
Nice way to finish, lovely 7‑iron, nearly went in.   If we can shoot a couple under tomorrow in the early round, which is obviously going to be an advantage, you know, sort of get back in contention, because I feel like my game's good.

Q.   We haven't seen you in the weekend since 2010, but this is clearly a course you have an affinity with having won here in '86. 
DAME LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, like I said I think it's the fairest of the links courses because when you hit a good shot, you're in a good spot.   Whereas some of them, you can just trundle off into those bunkers and you're chipping out backwards and stuff.   This one, it just demands good shots and if you hit them, you get rewarded.
