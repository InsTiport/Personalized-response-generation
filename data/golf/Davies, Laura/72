  Q.  Going into tomorrow your third match, you're a good match-play player, looking forward to it?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah, I've won a match-play tournament before.  So obviously you know you have what it takes to close out a match which is very important.  I struggled today to do it.  Normally you'd like to do it straight off.  The course, if it's windy, that's good for me.  So a nice windy weekend with a nice bit of sun on our back should be a good weekend.   
  
  Q.  What are the advantages of being a good wind player and match-play player on this course?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  There's some really long shots you've got to hit out there, some of the par 3s.  I think with my long irons, I can really hit low shots and keep them under the wind and control the ball a lot better than some of the other girls who hit it maybe a little bit higher.
