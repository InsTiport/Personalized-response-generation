MODERATOR:  Thanks for coming in.  Pretty tough day out there scoring-wise.  You put together a good round. 
LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah, yeah, got off to a decent start.  Birdied the 2nd, hit a 6-iron, chipped and putted for an easy birdie.  Then I had three bogeys.  3-putted No.  3.  Very close to the green on No.  6, didn't get up and down, that was careless.  Hit it in the greenside bunker on No.  7, didn't get up and down.  That was probably the toughest of the three bogeys I had.  After that, three birdies.  Didn't really look like making another bogey. 

Q.  Did the wind play a big factor in the afternoon or was it more the greens? 
LAURA DAVIES:  I think it was the firmness of the greens really.  The wind was there, you knew it was there, you had to be careful, but it was the hardness of the greens.

Q.  Have to pull clubs?
LAURA DAVIES:  Not too bad.  We were pretty much just playing front of the greens, unless the pin was hanging back on the right like it was on 15.  Other than that, we were trying to hit it on the front.  We knew it was going to bounce up. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  I think that's what they decided to do.  I was very disappointed to get here and see how short the rough is.  It's short.  You're not getting bad lies.  I hit one really poor shot out of it.  I thought I had too good of a lie and tried to take advantage of it.  It still hurts you.  They've obviously decided to firm up the greens instead of having the long rough.  It's making it harder than if we had the long rough.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LAURA DAVIES:  To pitch in, I hit a 6-iron into 2.  It pitched on the front edge and went right over the back.  You need to be hitting it a long way down the fairway so you can go in with your wedges and then you have a chance of stopping it. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  It's not a problem.  I don't think anyone will be worried.  You expect Annika to do that.  It would be a little bit more worrying if she wasn't on the leaderboard.  You would think something had gone wrong.  You know she's going to be there and you know you've got to play well. 
Yeah, it's a challenge.  Annika might well win, but I don't consider she won it already because there's a lot of golf to be played. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  No, I just want to win it.  It's my favorite golf course in the world.  It's the question we get asked so many times.  It's always Mission Hills.  I've never won around here.  Whether I ever will or not, only time will tell.  I just love playing the course. 
No, I don't feel any extra pressure.  I really want to win it.  That's not pressure.  It's just what you want to do.  Sometimes that makes it slightly harder.  If there's one girl in the field that wants to win it any less than me, I'd be very surprised. 

Q.  You've come back into good form.  What do you put that down to?
LAURA DAVIES:  Just not worrying about bad shots.  If I do hit a bad one, it's not the end of the world, I just get on with it.  I'm trying to hit good shots, whereas last year and the year before I was probably worried about hitting bad shots.  You just can't play like that.  This game's too tough when you play it like that.

Q.  Driver working well?
LAURA DAVIES:  Very well.  I didn't hit a huge amount of fairways.  The way the course sets up for me, my idea is to get it as far down there as I can.  Even coming out of the rough, just hit sand wedges, pitching wedges, not leave ourselves too much in.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LAURA DAVIES:  You don't need to be shooting three-over, four-over today, that's for sure.  Obviously, the big names are on the board.  You can't afford to give them too much room. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  We're not hitting driver  -- certainly not hitting it on 6.  Probably tomorrow we won't hit it on No.  7 either.  Maybe four or five times hit the iron out there.  The other 10 times hit driver, and hit it hard. 

Q.  Have you seen the 13-year-old out here?
LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah, she was in Hawaii when we were playing the Skins Game, walking around, watching us.  I've seen her hit it.  She hit it in a couple of places today, because we were behind her, very, very impressive.  She's going to be  -- she's very good at the moment.  But when she's 18, 19, as long as she's not bored with the game, she's going to be the real thing.  Well, she already is. 

Q.  Have you seen a 13-year-old of that kind of caliber before?
LAURA DAVIES:  I started playing golf when I was 14, so she's now (inaudible) when I haven't even started playing. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  That's true.  You never know.  She probably bloody can, to be honest.  Very wicked in the air. 
No, I think she's unusual.  She's such a nice girl.  Obviously, her mum and dad are very sensible.  They're not pushy.  She obviously loves to play.  She's a very nice young girl.  So the future is bright.  As long as she doesn't, you know  -- it's hard when you think she's got to wait seven years, six years, before she can turn pro.  It's hard. 
MODERATOR:  Let's go over the score card.  6-iron on No. 2.  You chipped. 
LAURA DAVIES:  Just through the back, chipped to about three feet, four feet, made the putt. 
Bogey at the next.  3-putt from about 50 feet. 
MODERATOR:  How far was your par putt there? 
LAURA DAVIES:  About five feet. 
Bogey on No.  6.  Hit a nice 9-iron in.  Came down just short of the green.  Had an easy chip.  Hit it to about four feet, missed the putt. 
Bogey on the next.  Pulled a 9-iron.  I was in the rough off the tee.  Pulled a 9-iron into the left-hand bunker.  Impossible up and down.  Didn't get up and down. 
MODERATOR:  How far was that par 5? 
LAURA DAVIES:  About 18 feet. 
Then 7-iron into the 8th to about, oh, no more than about 12 feet. 
Then birdie on 12.  Hit a 3-iron off the tee and an 8-iron to about eight feet. 
Birdie on 14.  9-iron to about probably 15 feet. 
Then 18, hit driver, 7-iron, sand iron to about eight feet. 
MODERATOR:  Pretty good irons today. 
LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah.  You know, I played well.  Hit a  -- missed a few greens, but we were short rather than left or right.  That's always a good sign, as far as I'm concerned.  Only missed one green left, and that was No.  7. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
LAURA DAVIES:  We decided it's a long week, whatever happens today or tomorrow, we're going to make some bogeys around here, because it's a great golf course.  As long as we don't let them get us down, we're going to make birdies, too, because I'm playing so well.  That's exactly how it worked out. 
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much. 
LAURA DAVIES:  Thank you.
