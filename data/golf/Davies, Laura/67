  Q. So you're 1-up.  How did you both play?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Becky was very steady.  She held us together nicely for the most part.  She's very good.   
  
  Q.  1-up, how many to go?   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Yeah.  It was good.  It's a good session for us.  It's the first time we actually -- the European team is getting on top a little bit.  We've got to go again on the next few holes.   
  
  Q.  Thanks, Laura.   
 LAURA DAVIES:  Thank you.
