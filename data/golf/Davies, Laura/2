  Q. Just a quick question about your round today.  Bogey-free.  How was your round out there today?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I played -- made a couple of dodgy tee shots.  I got a bit nervous on 16 because I don't like that tee shot.  Pulled it, got away with it, and good up and down for a par.
 But on the whole my irons were good.  It's all new for me at the moment because I've just signed with Callaway, so it's all new clubs.  But Barry and Paul, the guys in the trailer, they've set me up with what seems to be the perfect set now.  So it's down to me to play well.  I can't blame the equipment.
 Q. Do you feel any difference from last week at Gainbridge?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I mean, it's two completely different golf courses.  Last week demanded -- well, it wasn't tight off the tee but you always felt like if you let one go you were in all sorts of trouble.  Here you've got a bit of leeway.
 So two very different, very good golf courses.  Greens are a bit firm, but that's because they're new.  The layout, I love it.  You can get the out driver and have a go.
 Q. Speaking of the layout, there are some tribute holes out here.  How is that playing some of the courses and feeling like you're in different countries?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Well, I think 11 and 12 for us, 12 and 13 at Augusta, are unbelievably similar.  Now, the road hole is a bit of stretch because obviously you haven't got the huge mansion clubhouse behind you and the road hole without the hotel.
 But you can see the design 100% and the little postage stamp.  Apart if the bunkers they're in very similar spots.  A little bit easier, again, really good, well designed holes.
 Q. Which one is your favorite?
 LAURA DAVIES:   I think 11 for us, the 12th at Augusta.  It's so lifelike.  I've only stood on it once playing.  I've stood there many a time watching the guys, but it is so similar it's frightening.  It's very frightening actually.
 Q. Did you make some equipment changes between last week and this week then?  Did you tweak your clubs?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, yeah.  So when I got here Barry decided that those irons were going way too fast.  I'm not making excuses last week.  I played okay.  Just couldn't control the distance.
 So they put me in this completely different set of irons and they're distance controlled back again.  So hit a few ropey shots, but that's down to my swing and lack of playing really.  So I can't complain.
 Q. What do you have now?
 LAURA DAVIES:   They're the Forge, the X Forge rather than the Apex -- I forget what they're called.  They're a lot more forgiving the ones I had before.  Probably because I'm so old now they thought, Oh, give her a bit of help.
 But, no the new ones are nice.  They're harder to hit, but the better I start playing the better results I'll get because my distance will be so much better with them?
 Q. Your thoughts on Ciganda.
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, played great.  Played great.  Yesterday should have shot 3- or 4-under probably and then today could have shot 8 or 9.
 She is in good position and, yeah, very solid stuff.
 Q. When will we see you next?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Not until L.A. unfortunately because I'm not the in ANA, so there is no point in coming all the way.  I was going to do Hawaii but I decided just to L.A., so I've got six weeks off after this, which is a shame.
 Once Kingsmill starts then I've got a really good solid run of tournaments for about four months.  That's what I'm looking forward to.  This is just get used to the equipment, hope I start getting some confidence, because I need some.
 Q. Just a couple.  March is Women's History Month.  So many golfers look up to you.  What's advice that you give to most all the golfers out there?
 LAURA DAVIES:   I think we get so wrapped up in our own games.  Just try and enjoy it a bit more.  I know when I was younger I was hard on myself and didn't give myself too many breaks.  I think it's tough old game out there for playing this particular sport professionally.
 They need to give themselves a little bit of a break.  They are very hard on themselves.  That's what I see from a distance.
 Q. Last question, promise.  Outside of golf who was someone that you looked up to growing up who's a female?
 LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, I was going to say Nancy Lopez would've sprung to mind, but outside of golf, probably sportswomen like Chris Evert-Lloyd.  I used to love watching her play, and Navratilova in the tennis ranks.  If you want to look closer to home, the Queen of England.  She's a pretty special lady.  I've always been a big royalist.  QE will do it for me.
