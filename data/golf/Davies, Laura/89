DANA VON LOUDA:   69 70, 5 under total.  Some general comments and we'll go over your scorecard.
LAURA DAVIES:   Just chasing Karen and trying to keep within reach of her.  Had a nice finish, birdied three of the last five holes.  It's tough.  I think 36 coming home will be one of the better scores.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Let's go through your card.
LAURA DAVIES:  On the first hole, I hit a driver and a 6 iron that just hit short, went just through the back edge and 2 putted from about 35, 40 feet.

Bogey on 6.  Hit a 3 iron off the tee and 7 iron that came just short of the green had about a 45 foot putt and left it about six feet short and missed that one.

Then driver, 9 iron at next to about 25 feet.  Hit the first putt a little too hard, about five feet by and missed the one coming back.

And birdie on 10 with a driver, 9 iron to about 20 feet.  Hit a good putt but missed it and tapped in for birdie.

7 iron down 13 to probably about eight or nine feet and holed that one.

Birdie at 14.  Driver, 4 iron just left into the green side bunker, punched out to about 18 inches, so tapped that in.

Birdie at the last.  Driver, wedge, to probably about 25 feet and holed that.
Q.  How far was the 9 iron at the 10th?
LAURA DAVIES:   I had 154.  Big drive.
Q.  Do you find that the drives on particular holes is difficult?
LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah it's one of those rounds, you hit the ball left to right, it pretty nice, you get in the bunker then hit it as hard as you can.  It's only two days,  after yesterday, it's slightly longer.  I hit wedge in yesterday.
Q.  How many marks out of 10 would you give yourself for the first 36 holes?
LAURA DAVIES:   Only about six or seven because the putting has been really good.  I've dropped a few shots by 3 putting.  I think I've had like five bogeys that have all been from quite big distances and just off the front of the green.  So you're trying to just keep the ball low to the ground.  But my holing out has been really good and if I've had a birdie chance I've holed it.  So I don't feel I'm leaving lots of shots on the course and the driver has been pretty decent.  A few  irons would be the worst part of the week and I think that's my strongest part.  Hopefully sharpen that up for the weekend.
Q.  You mentioned early that youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re chasing Karen. Is that because she is the leader or because she is a fellow Englishman?
LAURA DAVIES:   No, she's the leader.  I'm pleased to see another English player up there doing really well.  The fact that she's English is irrelevant.  The fact that shes's 9 under is very relevant.
Q.  What do you know about Karen's game?  YouÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve played with her before?
LAURA DAVIES:  Every time I play with her, very impressive, hits the ball really long, very aggressive, shots into the pins.  Yeah, she's the real thing, definitely.  Yes, someone is going to have to get out there and go and find her.
Q.  Did you see before this season that this would happen to Karen?
LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, it was Karen   because last year she played really solid as well.  Not too many times she was in contention, but when she was in contention in Tucson this year, I played with her on Sunday and she played excellent golf.  She went ahead and won that one.  So there's no reason to suspect she won't do the same this week.  And last week at Evian she played some great stuff, too.
Q.  How many tournaments are you running this year?
LAURA DAVIES:   Just the one today.  No, just the one and that was it.  It's all over now.  6 and 5, actually.
Q.  Where?
LAURA DAVIES:   18.

They will have to fish for it, had the boots     inaudible.
Q.  I heard your gathering was a bit more professional this year?
LAURA DAVIES:   That was 150 people there at one point, maybe not     I don't know.  But there seemed to be a lot of people.  There was 50, a few substitutes, so at least 50 to 60 players plus everybody else.
Q. How many were you catering to? And your mom did all the catering?
LAURA DAVIES:   We just had a pretty good guess of it.  We thought 150 round of sandwiches and about 100 chicken drumsticks and it worked out so that was nice.
Q.  And the weather was nice?
LAURA DAVIES:   Yeah, it was perfect, too hot almost.  I bought six cases of water and they went before the last game.  The water was going very nicely.
Q.  So you could have a career at the FA?
LAURA DAVIES:   No, possibly the World Cup in 2012 or something.
Q.  How many drivers have you hit over last couple of days?
LAURA DAVIES:   I think I hit five today and six today, the only place I changed     no, I hit driver on 16 as well, so maybe seven today.  Six or seven, anyway.
Q.  How was the pace of play?
LAURA DAVIES:   I think the girls play too slowly.  Having been inside the ropes a couple of weeks ago watching the boys play Troon     five hours and 25 minutes the first few days, that says it all.  We should play quicker.  I think everyone knows that.

I think they speed up when theyÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re being timed and then slow down again when the officials leave, itÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s an art form, it's bloody irritating.
Q.  What should be done?
LAURA DAVIES:   Shoot them.  They are very good, unless you change the rules, it's just one of those things, and I don't think it will ever get quicker and I don't know why.
Q.  It is a problem on the womenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s tour?
LAURA DAVIES:   I think on the women's tour, I've just got a feeling that the reason all of these short ones are being marked is it's line putting.  Everyone is so conscious of standing on someone's  line.  If someone is putting from over here you're tapping in over here.  The girls seem to take much more care about standing on the lines.  I think the guys just putt out anywhere from two feet, three feet in; they will just hole out.

I'm not saying     I think their etiquette is over the top.  People should just, you know, tap it in, unless it's really wet greens.  Greens like this, you could stand all day in a spot and not make an indentation which is perfect.  I don't know, maybe that's something.
Q.  Is it everybody?
LAURA DAVIES:   You've got to ask the officials, they are the ones with the clock.  They are the ones who know who is slow and who is not.  I could say names but it's just not worth it.  The officials have all of the data, so they would know who the slow players are.
Q.  Have you brought this up to the officials?
LAURA DAVIES:   Not really.  No one listens to me.
Q.  How long should it take?
LAURA DAVIES:   To go around a course like this, you would not want to be much over 4:00, 4:15.  If I went around with a few friends, we would get around in a few hours comfortably.
Q.  If you were with your friends, you would not have any advantage of the ball spotters, etc?
LAURA DAVIES:   No, but that's no surprise.
Q.  What is it like?
LAURA DAVIES:   No, you canÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t see it on TV, if you're out in a specific group, it would be a little better, but it's tough for me when I'm playing.
Q.  And what do you do when you're playing with someone who is slow?
LAURA DAVIES:   I just start walking around.
Q.  What will you do for the rest of the day?
LAURA DAVIES:   Nothing really.  Just go home.  Go home and watch a bit of TV, actually watch the golf on the tele.  Might as well.  Might pick up a few tips.
