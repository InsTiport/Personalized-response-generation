LAURA DAVIES: Well, our match today obviously  for a while there it looked pretty exciting, we were back and forth making birdies and A bogey here and  there, then all of a sudden it didn't seem that  important anymore because obviously we had lost The Cup  by the time -- I think we were on the 17th.  I think we  basically had had it.  So, it was just a matter of  playing with a bit of pride and I even messed that up.  They played very well as a team.  5-all coming in and  we had our chance today and just didn't do it.   
 

Q.  Do you feel like this is how the team stands;  the score's reflective of the abilities of the team or  do you think that it is lopsided in favor of the  Americans? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Obviously, they are a very strong team and  they won today.  We had the first two days of  competition and they have beaten us on Sunday.  Usually  most golf tournaments it is who plays best on Sunday  wins, that is just what happened.  The American team --  Brandie played very well today.  She holed a lot of  good putts today. She missed a couple of short ones;  gave me a chance and I managed to miss a couple too,  just to stay with her and then it seemed like the rest  of them were making -- every time you turn around, it  was a big cheer.  Obviously, the bigger the cheer, it  was obviously the American team.   
 

Q.  What about on 16? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Unlucky.  Just only had an approach wedge in  my hands and just at the top of my backswing, a leaf  just blew right on top of my ball and I was committed  to the swing by then, and I just didn't hit it at all.  You know, at that stage, I was still thinking if I  could just win my match, maybe Lotte can hold on or  something; maybe Pam in front could do something and  then we still had a chance because we had Ali's win and  so that point, that was pretty cruel to get that leaf  blown in there, but that is the way it goes.   
 

Q.  Were you surprised when you saw the order of  the team that you were down in 7--
 
LAURA DAVIES: No, I was happy with that.  I always like  going out 7th.  I rather go out later than earlier.  Mickey was always forced to put me out earlier.  I was  happy to go there.  It didn't matter where you go. You  got to win a point.  If it gets to the situation where  you need the point, you got to win it.  Doesn't matter  really where it comes.   
 

Q.  Could you compare the American team from two  years ago to the American team this year, now? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Well, they are very good.  Both teams shaped  up very well.  It all comes down to putting.  First  time they hole the putts; the second time we holed them  and this time, certainly from what I saw of it, they  holed the putts.  That is just the way it goes.  I think they have got a great team, really  friendly team, and I think we all had fun during the  week.  That is -- I am a bit disappointed to begin  with, but we tried our best and, you know, they get The  Cup back, but we are certainly gunning for it in two  years.   
 

Q.  The key then for the whole thing you think is  putting, as in any event? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, if you don't make  the putts -- I mean, if I had putted well early on then  I would have had Brandie well down and I am sure a few  of the other girls, they just didn't make the crucial  putts and the American girls did.  And you have just  got to take your hat off to that.  If you make the  putts under pressure, obviously, you are a good  player.  They did it; we didn't.   
 

Q.  Anything about the greens that caused you  problems? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: I just missed -- I putted really badly all  week; just didn't really seem to get to terms with  them.  I love the golf course, though.  The greens  didn't quite suit me though.   
 

Q.  What was your yardage on 16 and approach? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: 117 yards which is perfect for my middle  wedge.  It was slightly down wind and Brandie was  left.  I was thinking, here we go get back one up now.   
 

Q.  Other players commented about the leaves  today being a problem.  Did you notice any problems  with that earlier, Friday or Saturday? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: No, just today really, Brandie and I both on  the 8th hole hit good shots near the green, around the  green; on the 5th we were both in a pile of leaves.  Again, that is the same for everybody.  It is a windy  day and there is leaves falling off the trees, nothing  you can do about it.  Just try and miss them, I guess.  Having them blow in your backswing, that is purely bad  luck; nothing you can do about it.   
 

Q.  Would you say that -- who do you think was  their most valuable player? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: They got 12 most valuable players as far as I  am concerned, they are the winning team.  That is --  like I said, someone said come on, win your heart; get  a halve here up the last-- really and truly, that is --  you are talking from personal stuff and there is no  place for that in a team event.  If I get a half a  point and we lose by half a point less, that is  absolutely no less satisfying to me at all.  I think  they have 12 most valuable players including Michelle  McGann.  I know she did a lot of work for their team;  encouraging them all.  Obviously, Captain Karner did a  fantastic job.  They got 12 of them I wouldn't single  out anybody.   
 

Q.  Did you play Burton in 1992? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Yeah.   
 

Q.  Compare her now to then? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Well, she was good then and she is now.  There is not much difference in anyone's game.  The  teams are still very much similar.  It is one loss on  the day.  Our team is just as good as their team.  On  this day they beat us; they get The Cup.  That is  exactly what happened two years ago.   
 

Q.  Your personal goals for the rest of this  year? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: I lost The Cup now.  Now I got to try to win  the money list.   
 

Q.  Was this more important to you than the money  list? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: It is a completely different thing.  This is,  as I say, this was a team thing and that is a personal  thing and the two would have gone very, very nicely and  the trophy, to be honest, hopefully I will hang on to  one of them; you just don't know what is going to  happen.   
 

Q.  Laura, you said that the win at Dalmahoy  really validated women's golf.  Do you think the  crushing defeat this week will hurt it? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: I hardly think it is a crushing defeat.  As I  say, score lines are absolutely irrelevant and  completely -- nothing to do with it.  I am sure Lotte  and Reid, back of the field thought, oh, well, we can't  win The Cup now.  What are you going to play for?  You  are playing for a point, big deal, a point is nothing.  It is -- the overall thing is the team and I don't  think this is a crushing defeat.  It is a good victory  for them and that is the end of it.   
 

Q.  Why do you think, as a group, the Europeans  play better in this team competition than they seem to  play individually week after week? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: I think we play pretty well, individually.  You got a lot of winners on our team on the LPGA  considering how few of us there are and how many  Americans there are.  I think ratio of wins I think we  stay well up alongside. Lotte and I have won 6.  Alfie  won one, that is 7.  And if you are checking Canadians  talking, 10 victories this year.  That is pretty good  averages.   
 

Q.  It just seems as a group when you play in  this, you seem to play to compliment one another? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: We are just trying to win the match.  We all  want to win for each other and for Mickey; want to win  for the Tour.  You want to -- when you are given a  great target like you are given in The Solheim Cup on  Sunday afternoon, you don't need much more than that.  I mean, of course, you are going to try and play well.   
 

Q.  What was the point in the afternoon when you  felt that it might be slipping away from you? 
 
LAURA DAVIES: Well, pretty much when -- walking onto the  17th green and I basically heard that Meg was in a  strong position at the last to beat Pam.  That was good  enough because, well, if Brandie had missed that putt,  I suppose there was an outside chance I could have won  my match going at last on 17, but once she holed that,  The Cup was lost at that stage and, as I say, you are  just playing for -- well, you are not really playing  for a lot then.
