Q. How about your overall assessment of the day?
LAURA DAVIES: I played badly.  I could have done better because I could have putted better.  I putted well, but I didn't hole anything.  That putt at the last was a classic example, just -- but overall I didn't hit it well tee to green.  I think 3-over is a fair result.  I don't deserve much better than that because it was -- I hit some really rough shots right in the middle of the round when it got really hot, and yeah, it was poor.
Q. So you lost some ground.  What's in your mind for getting that back tomorrow?
LAURA DAVIES: Well, it's going to be hot again tomorrow, so it's going to be tough for everybody, but I'd have to do what Trish did.  I'd have to go and shoot 6-under or 5-under or whatever she shot and just try and post level par -- well, that would be 1-over, wouldn't it, 5-under.  So yeah, my chance is pretty much gone, unless I go crazy tomorrow.  But I have to play better because it was poor today.
Q. Would you like to transport yourself back to Chicago where those low scores came?
LAURA DAVIES: That's the trouble, it's a completely different golf course.  Every hole you've got out of bounds left and right and that's never been a favorite thing of mine.  You've got a few holes out there where there's no OB, but all you see is white sticks, and I'm afraid it's worn me down during the week, and I paid the penalty today.
