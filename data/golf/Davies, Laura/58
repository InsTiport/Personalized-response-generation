  Q. Laura, condolences. This has got to be a hugely disappointing for you.   
 LAURA DAVIES: Well, it is. 17 I gave away. That was a really stupid tee shot. I was right in, and I should have just put it back in the bag but I just stood there anxious to get on with it because she was in very good position so I gave that one up.   
 18, I did exactly what I wanted to, 4-iron, layup with my sand iron, but the second one hit right on the top of the tree and I never imagined it would drop down. It dropped straight down.  
  
  Q. This must feel like a win for Brittany Lang. Does it feel like a loss for you?   
 LAURA DAVIES: 100 percent. I was never down. I was 3-up after 10 and playing nicely. Made a bit of a mess of 12, hit what I thought was a good tee shot and it was right in one of those big trees in the fairway. Other than that, though, hit it solid, and like I say, one bad shot on 17 and a big bit of bad luck on 18.
