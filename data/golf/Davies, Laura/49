 Q. How would you assess the round from yesterday? 
 LAURA DAVIES: I didn't play well again today and just the timing is all out, I don't know. And then I was going at 2-under, considering how I played, was good.
 And then made the triple on 17, was all stuck in the palm three and had to drop it, and plugs when you drop it in that sand. Triple; tournament is over now, just playing for fun. Hopefully made the cut. Should have done; I think four is okay.

 Q. You think four should get you there?
 LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, Johnny said it was three yesterday, so it will probably be five. The weather is pretty good today. Maybe come down one.

 Q. So on 17, was the drive --
 LAURA DAVIES: I hit a shocking tee shot, pulled a 2-iron left out of the bank and just for once, I decided I'd play safe, just knock it back in the fairway; and instead of going for a really difficult 3-iron, low 3-iron off the hill, and I played safe and knocked it in the top of the palm tree.

 Q. So your second shot went into the palm tree? 
 LAURA DAVIES: Went into the palm tree, took the drop, plugged it, short for four, on for five, thought I made the six which I suppose at the end of the day isn't that big of a deal but at the time it was. So triples are horrible.
