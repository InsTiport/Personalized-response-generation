STEVEN FRANKLIN: What are your feelings coming back here as you had the title in your grasp in 2003?
CARL MASON:  There are moments when I think about it.  When I was watching the end of The Open on Sunday I was thinking about it. It doesn't destroy me or anything like that, but I keep thinking what could have been, or what should have been.
STEVEN FRANKLIN: Is it just this time of year when you think about it?
CARL MASON:  Not really. Occasionally something just triggers it - it might be a picture of Tom Watson or I hear Turnberry mentioned, or I am watching a Major Championship.
STEVEN FRANKLIN: What was your initial reaction when you heard the Championship was coming back to Turnberry?
CARL MASON:  I was delighted. It is a fabulous course, I love it to death. I love links golf.
STEVEN FRANKLIN: And you've proven that you have the game around here, despite it not working out how you would have wished?
CARL MASON:  Yeah, I can't complain. It was as good an effort as I could ever have put in. Thankfully I have great memories of the place and I went on to do great things, so it obviously hasn't affected me.
STEVEN FRANKLIN:  You've won the Order of Merit twice; is this the one thing that you think is missing and maybe something you deserve?
CARL MASON:  In a way, but how many chances do you get. When you have a chance to win and it's major, you want to try and take advantage.  That was obviously a golden chance. However, I will enjoy it here again - you can't help but enjoy it here.
STEVEN FRANKLIN: How is your game now?
CARL MASON:  I've been working hard on my game this last three weeks.  I'm pleased with the way I'm hitting the ball, so that's good.

It would be nice if I had played more.
STEVEN FRANKLIN: And how is the back?
CARL MASON: Touch wood, it's holding up good. This year it's been marvelous so far.
