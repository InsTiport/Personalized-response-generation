Q. Does this event bring something out of you?
CARL MASON:  Well, yes, it brought back happy memories and I was looking forward to it. My game has not been good in the last few weeks, I have had back problems and I have had to miss some tournaments but I have had a couple of wins so it is in there somewhere. I had a little tip from my good friend, Derrick Cooper, yesterday and that has put me back on track. I think because of my back I was protecting it a little bit and swinging it a little bit too much with arms and not getting enough turn but he sorted me out.
Q.  Quite a turnaround on the back nine?
CARL MASON: Yes, I just hung in there. One double bogey on the par three sixth, I was on for one, off for one, on for two, off for two, it was one of those. I just hung in there on the back nine, made a couple of putts and in the end I was pleased with the way I played.
Q. Have you replayed the last hole of last year, over in your mind?
CARL MASON: I have played it so many times over in my mind that I could make a five one-handed now as you can imagine. Occasionally I think about it but as I have said before, I took away all the positive things from it, it didn't affect me and I went on to win a lot of tournaments after it. But it was a great experience and what happened is part of the game I'm afraid.
