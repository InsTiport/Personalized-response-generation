 Q.  Pleased with your play today?  
CARL MASON: Yeah, I'm deliriously happy.  You go out there knowing it's going to be a battling day, and you know you've just got to try and be patient and accept a few bad things are going to happen.  I just played some really nice shots and putted quite nicely, and only one disaster, really.  I was very pleased with that.   
I had some lovely shots and I did have a couple of good up-and-downs, which always helps.  But I was hitting the ball pretty solid, you know, most of the time.  I was quite happy.   
 Q.  Would you say these are some of the toughest conditions you've played?  
CARL MASON: Yeah, this is relentless.  It's just patience, and you know, putting, everything's difficult.  Putting's difficult, keeping still.  And it really is about being patient and accepting some nasty things might happen.   
 Q.  How much of a challenge is it to focus physically and mentally?  
CARL MASON: Oh, yeah, it's tiring.  I'm absolutely shattered now.  I'm going to sleep beautifully tonight.  I'm happy with the way I've performed today, and you know, 1-under par around there today is an excellent score.
