SIMON WILSON:  Nice round of golf you must be very happy with that.
CARL MASON:   Yeah, very pleased.  I played really solid and very few mistakes, really.  It was a good round in tough conditions.
SIMON WILSON:  Nice to be playing on the weekend.
CARL MASON:   Yeah, that's where we like to be.  If I can keep playing like that, I'll be very happy.
SIMON WILSON:  No complaints with the back, it's been okay?
CARL MASON:   No, at long last, at long last I feel like I'm swinging the club properly.
Q.  Inaudible?
CARL MASON:   Well, I thought     I just think because of the back and when I came back playing, I think it was, it affected my swing.  I was not     well, I was a little wary of it and wasn't quite swinging as I should be.  I was protecting it a little bit.  And thankfully, my good friend     inaudible    got me back on track.  So that was good.
SIMON WILSON:  Birdie on 3.
CARL MASON:   3, 9 iron to six feet.

Birdied No. 11.  8 iron there to about five feet.  Very strong downwind.  Tried to hit a sand wedge and it just popped out of the edge nearly on to the front of the green and it was a 3 putt.

14, the bogey on 14, bad tee shot short left.
SIMON WILSON:  What was the club there?
CARL MASON:   3 iron.  We had a long wait there.  We had two groups on the tee, so it was not a hole that you want a long wait on.

Great birdie on 16, great birdie.  That hole was playing really long.  I had an excellent drive and a 3 iron to about 18 feet.
Q.  Talk about 14.
CARL MASON:   Well, it was sort of a 20 minute wait on the tee, not the ideal.  Well, it's not your favorite hole anyway.  It's not one that you want to stand there and keep thinking about it.
