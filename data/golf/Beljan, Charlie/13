Q.   How do you explain hanging in there? 
CHARLIE BELJAN:   You know, my game has been good.   I just haven't been scoring, and finally after all the hoopla that took place after last year, everything's kind of starting to finally settle down. 
Starting to just focus on playing golf again.   Been working hard with my swing coach and then the new short game guy, it's really paid off.   I rolled it wonderful today and that's kind of been my downfall the first three or four weeks.   I've hit it wonderfully but just hit it horribly.   This has been a good golf course for me.
I made one bad swing, a double‑bogey and 3‑putted 18 in the dark.   Other than that it was a wonderful round of golf.   Seems like I show up every once in awhile so maybe this will be a good week for me to show up.

Q.   Were you determined to finish 18?   Was that the thought process?
CHARLIE BELJAN:   Well, playing with Retief and Bo, didn't really have much pull compared to those guys, so I just went ahead and went with the flow.   That was fine.   It wasn't anybody's fault other than mine.   And shoot, if you would have told me this morning I would have signed for 67, I would have said all right and just sat at home.   But very happy and off to great start.
