Q.   3-under today; your thoughts on how it went?
CHARLIE BELJAN:   Well, you guys are talking to me again, so that's a good sign.   I played exceptionally well, bogeyed 12 again which I think is the hardest hole on the course out here.   Will McGirt and Brian Harman started out hot, put on a putting display and I got frustrated not rolling them in, but stayed patient and put myself in great position for tomorrow and looking forward to the final pairing with two great guys, McGirt and McNeill. 

Q.   The shot at 11, your second, you got it nice and tight for the eagle.
CHARLIE BELJAN:   That was a tough one.   We had 274 and knew if we could just carry the front it would release back there.   We thought we hit a great shot but the crowd behind the green, nobody clapped so they must be darned good players sitting back there.   Had six, eight feet for eagle and knocked that in and that kind of got us going and moving the right direction.
Here I am again, another chance, another opportunity and tomorrow is a big day for everybody that's playing and looking forward to the challenge.
