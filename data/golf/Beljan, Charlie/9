Q.   67, round one, is that all you could get? 
CHARLIE BELJIAN:   No, that was not.   Played a great front nine, my back nine shot 4‑under par and made the turn, birdied No. 1, gettable par 5, bogeyed 2 and then hit a lot of great shots coming in but the greens just were a little bumpy this afternoon as they always are, poa annua, but it's the same for everybody and tomorrow I'm looking forward to some fresh greens and hitting more aggressive putts.

Q.   You obviously played very well at this golf course, do you like playing here?
CHARLIE BELJIAN:   I very much enjoy it.   I would probably say it's my favorite course on Tour.   Obviously I've played well at a few other spots I really enjoy but just coming here, feeling, I get to hit a lot of drivers, it's a ball‑striker's course I think, so I just‑‑ I do, I enjoy coming here, the history, everything about this place is pretty amazing.

Q.   What was keeping you in the round today? 
CHARLIE BELJIAN:   You know, I started out the season well, had a couple bad weeks the last few weeks, got a new caddie on the bag, a friend of mine, real good green reader, upbeat, positive, and that's what‑‑ we just kept hitting good putts and they weren't going in but we just kept our head up and kept moving on. 
This morning was the first competitive round I played‑‑ didn't end the way I wanted it but at the same time today I made a par on 10 and I was very pleased with that and I was onto No. 11. 

Q.   Last year, you lost in a playoff, how are you feeling right now? 
CHARLIE BELJIAN:   Great.   I had a great day today, like I said, I could have got a few more coming in but we got three rounds of golf left and normally I'm not a very good player on Thursday, Friday, so I put myself in a nice position for three more rounds of golf and I'm looking forward to it.
