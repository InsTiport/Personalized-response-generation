 Q.  Red one is a nice number on moving day.  Describe your round.  How did things go for you?  CHARLIE BELJAN: Red one is a great round on moving day.  Looking forward to one more tomorrow.  Started off tough.  We were two over, then just hung in there.  Made a couple good par putts then cruised along, made the nice 2 on No. 12, the drivable.  We've played that hole 4-under for the week.  Anything even par, 1-under, we were going to be making a big move.   Q.  In that vein, moving towards the top, you sort of watch everybody else in the afternoon and afternoons tend to make courses a little bit tougher.  Does that give you a little bit of incentive to think maybe I've got a shot here?  CHARLIE BELJAN: The way I'm hitting it right now, and if I found a little something on the putting green, this course you can go out and shoot a 3- or 4-under. I hope the wind blows 25 this afternoon and I hope the greens get harder and faster and we'll see what these guys do.  I think you can go there and shoot a quick 78, 79, 80, but I think if you play real well and put it in the right position and make a couple lengthy putts, which I think you have got to do, I think you can shoot 3- or 4-under.   Q.  On your own game, what do you need to do tomorrow not only to duplicate what you did today but to improve on it?  CHARLIE BELJAN: I need to keep doing what I've been doing, be patient, hit it to -- sometimes 40, 50 away from the hole is a good shot.  But we did everything wonderful tee to green and we hit a lot of good putts.  Tomorrow maybe a few more will fall.
