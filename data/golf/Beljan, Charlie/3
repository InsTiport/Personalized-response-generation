Q.   I know you didn't finish your round like you wanted to, but a great round and you're in a great position going into tomorrow. 
CHARLIE BELJAN:   It was a great round.   On 18 there, I've never shot 61 out here so I got a little aggressive, hit a bad shot, made bogey.   But, boy, if you would have told me I was going to shoot 8â€‘under and put myself back in the thick of things, especially how the year's been going, I would have been real happy.

Q.   What was going right for you today?
CHARLIE BELJAN:   Finally the putts started dropping.   I've been putting well for two or three weeks, but today I just found the center on every single hole. 
Two more days to go and I feel like I'm in a great position and if it doesn't quite go my way, I'm going to my favorite place next week, Riviera, so looking forward to it.

Q.   Where are you playing tomorrow?
CHARLIE BELJAN:   Spyglass, which is my favorite course out of all the courses we play on TOUR.   So I'm looking forward to it.
