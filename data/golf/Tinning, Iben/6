 Q. A little disappointed to finish with two bogeys but overall how pleased are you with your first two days? 
 IBEN TINNING: I'm very pleased. I have not played a tournament since mid-October, so I'm pretty happy with that. Obviously to finish off with two bogeys is not very nice but that's golf.

 Q. You have announced this going to be your last event; how do you feel that this big part of your life is no longer going to be part of it? 
 IBEN TINNING: I'm all right with it to be honest. I've done it for years. I'm not saying that I don't feel anything out there and I'm definitely going for more pins than I normally would, because why be a chicken the last event. So I'm all right with it. It might get worse on Sunday, I don't know. 

 Q. If you won, would you reconsider? 
 IBEN TINNING: No. No. I'm too injured. It's not possible. There's pain in my hip and it hurts every time I walk, so it's not really an option, unless I get absolutely fit all of a sudden. 

 Q. In terms of winning what, would it mean to win in your final tournament? 
 IBEN TINNING: Obviously that would be great. That would be undescribable.
