Q.  You played terrifically, but I'm sure you wish you would have holed that winning putt.

IBEN TINNING:  Oh, yeah, I should have holed that putt, but I'm disappointed in how it ended up.
Q.  Trish had a really great shot on 17, and it made it all possible for you to be in a position to possibly win the match on 18.

You want to talk about that.

TRISH JOHNSON:  I was playing poorly.  I'm delighted to have the half.
Q.  You're pregnant, and is it tough to put yourself under pressure?

IBEN TINNING:  No problem, I'm only 16 weeks.

I feel fine out there.
Q.  You've played in two singles matches and won one of them.  What advice do you give the rookies tomorrow?

IBEN TINNING:  Be strong, believe in yourself.
Q.  Good luck tomorrow.
