MARTIN PARK:  Iben, Suzann, thanks for coming in.  You both played 9 holes today.  Could you give us some thoughts on the course after a couple of days? 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I would say the course is in great shape.  The greens are really, really good.  The fairways are beautiful.  It all depends on how the weather is going to be pretty much. 

 IBEN TINNING:  The same as Suzann.  It's a great setup.  It's a course that you really want to attack, which is great for match play.  No chipping game this week. 


Q.  Did you play a match against each other or other two ?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  We were pretty much playing match play the whole week to get the mentality going and also to test out.  But we also had time to do our own shot, play our own game.


Q.  Who has been most successful in the games, in your matches? 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I don't know.  I don't really know the results. 

 IBEN TINNING:  I pretty much lost every match. 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I lost with Annika today.

IBEN TINNING:  I won one.  I do remember that. 


Q.  How does this compare with last year?  How?

IBEN TINNING:  I don't really think that  -- I haven't really felt the atmosphere yet.  There haven't been that many people yet.  But I guess we'll know by tomorrow and have a good answer for you. 


Q.  Does it feel special to you?  You're from Denmark, Norway, is it special to play in Sweden close to your home countries?

IBEN TINNING:  I think it is definitely.  I've really been thinking about it a lot, the whole year.  I really wanted to make it on the team.  I walk down the seaside and I can see my own country.  That's very nice. 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Of course I feel the same.  I don't think it really matters where you play because the team has such a good spirit.  For me it's taking a lot of the week to calm down.  I think it's just great to be on the team no matter where we play.

IBEN TINNING:  Of course it's always better to have a European crowd.  That always makes a difference, I think. 


Q.  How is Catrin doing today? 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Catrin it's the first time I've seen her on the course, which is very good to see.  It's good for the players to see their captain out there.  She's probably making up her mind for the priorities.  It's up and down every hour.


Q.  You've heard what's happened to the Secretary of State?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Foreign Minister, yes.  I saw the flags halfway down.


Q.  How big is the Solheim Cup in your home town for the people? 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  In Norway after me playing last year, I think they actually realize what the Solheim Cup was.  I don't think before that  -- I don't think that many people actually were aware of what it was.  But it's getting there.


Q.  When did they realize what it was?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I don't know.  You'd have to ask them.  I've always known what it's been.  If you're into golf I think you know what it is. 


Q.  But the main crowd, the main people, the people on the streets? 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I'm not quite sure.

IBEN TINNING:  Pretty much the same as in Norway.  You asked the same question?  Yes.  It's the same as in Norway.  We played the Solheim last year.  Pretty much everybody knew what it was, but it always starts with it's the same as the Ryder Cup for men.  It would be nice to switch that around.


Q.  Do you already know if you're playing tomorrow?

(Laughter.)

(No response.) 

MARTIN PARK:   Thanks, Suzann.  Thanks, Iben.
