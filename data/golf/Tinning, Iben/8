  Q.  How do you think it went out there today?  You must be disappointed.   
 IBEN TINNING:  Of course we are.  They're 3 down, and then we had a few horrible shots in the trees, and then Bettina had hit a few right.  Just in the beginning we were a little bit trying to get in the game, but then we got in the game and played fantastic.  Then we just had a huge turnaround at 10.  We played solid.  They played solid golf.  They holed every putt.   
  
  Q.  Are you looking forward to playing tomorrow and winning that point back?   
 IBEN TINNING:  Definitely.  I'll look forward to playing.   
  
  Q.  How is the mood in the European camp?   
 IBEN TINNING:  Excellent.
