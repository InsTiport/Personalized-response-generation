Q.  Iben, what a time to produce a shot like that.  How comfortable did you feel over the ball there?

IBEN TINNING:  Not very, actually, to be honest with you.  I just try to get a club where I could just really rip it and go for it.  And it turned out all right.


Q.  What was the game plan today, just all out attack?

IBEN TINNING:  Yeah.  Pretty much attack everything and just try to get the ball on the greens, in regulation and stuff, get the putts and stuff.


Q.  How special does it feel to have done this so close to Denmark?

IBEN TINNING:  Absolutely fantastic.  There were a lot of Danes all screaming my name.


Q.  Did anyone on the European team feel a little tired this morning, or did it help the way it finished yesterday afternoon?

IBEN TINNING:  Everybody is a little bit tired by now.  I'm all right because I just played one match every day.
