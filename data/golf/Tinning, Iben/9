 Q.  Have you ever played with Iben before, or is this the first time? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, that was the first time we played together. 

 Q.  How was it between you guys? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It was good. 

 Q.  How many birdies between you guys? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know.  Maybe three, four. 

 Q.  It was a great fight back? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, it was. 

 Q.  Okay.  What are you thinking for tomorrow, because you play again with her? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yes, I'm happy. 

 Q.  How do you feel about the European crowds?  Are they spurring you on? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yes, definitely. 

 Q.  What was the difference this afternoon? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think Iben made a few putts early on. 

 Q.  What's the difference between this morning and this afternoon? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Iben holed a few putts.  It was a difficult day making birdies.  Missed a couple shots and made a birdie coming in. 

 Q.  Tell me about that putt on 14. 
 IBEN TINNING:  I'm really embarrassed by myself.  I got so excited, I was -- it was a fantastic putt.  Hadn't made a long putt yet. 

 Q.  2-down early on, what was the case of recovery?  Was there a turning point? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think the turning point maybe was really the birdie on 8 and 10, we kind of sneaked one on 10.  Looking like they were probably going to win the hole and then she made a good up and down.  That was the key. 

 Q.  You were a captain's pick. 
 IBEN TINNING:  Yes.  I hope she's happy about it. 

 Q.  Wish you luck tomorrow.  Thank you. 
 IBEN TINNING:  Thank you very much.
