Q.  They got up pretty early taking three of the first five holes.  Did that change your strategy?

IBEN TINNING:   We halved four holes on birdies.
Q.  Then after this morning, you guys had a 3 1 lead.  How do you think this match fits into the afternoon?

IBEN TINNING:   If we can get 2 2 now on the board, I think that looks pretty good.
Q.  After playing this morning, how was playing this afternoon because it was really hot today?

MARIA HJORTH:   Not too bad, actually.  When you're out here playing, you get so much adrenaline going that you don't really feel the heat.
Q.  With Europe up in two of the matches, do you think the Captain would be happy if you went 2 and 2 in the afternoon?

MARIA HJORTH:   I think so.  Actually, I think it would be pretty good.  Tomorrow with a 5 3 lead, I think would be pretty good.
