  Q.  So how do you feel, Iben?   
 IBEN TINNING:  Tired, but also very happy.  I think my partner today actually playing quite brilliant.  I'm trying to make the pars, and she's makes all the putts.   
  
  Q.  Okay.  How are you playing?   
 IBEN TINNING:  Getting really tired.  I thought -- I'm playing alright.  I just don't stiff them as much, but it's a tough golf course.   
  
  Q.  So you're going to get out early and warm up?   
 IBEN TINNING:  I think it's good.   
  
  Q.  Are you disappointed over suspending?   
 IBEN TINNING:  No, not really.  It's just the way it is.   
  
  Q.  Right, I know.  Did you get cold out there at all?   
 IBEN TINNING:  It was cold.  When you're tired, you get cold, the wind and everything.  Been at this since 6:00 this morning, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Anything else?   
 IBEN TINNING:  No.  I think that's enough.
