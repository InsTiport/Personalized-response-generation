Q. You got it done?
PATTON KIZZIRE: It was a tight match.  We played well at times and had some struggles at times, but I stepped up there at the end and chipped in for eagle on 16 and then rolled in a really big putt on 17.  He made a nice one to continue the match.  I just liked the 17th hole.  I decided to lay-up every day.  Today it went a little farther than I expected.
Q. Is that adrenaline?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Maybe.  I hit a 5-iron, which I thought would be plenty to stay on the top of the hill.  I hit a nice shot in there and I was expecting him to make that.
Q. This 18-hole is where all the magic has happened.
PATTON KIZZIRE: I guess you could say that.  I played a lot of competitive matches with my buddies.  If I don't press, somebody presses on the last hole.  I'm geared up for the last hole and ready to make a birdie.
