Q. How do you describe your feelings right now?  You had a great round, a tremendous round.  You came back from what amounted to disaster to a good day today?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Yeah, yesterday was tough.  I lost my wits a little bit.  I kind of lost my focus.  I was really frustrated.  I've been playing some frustrating golf, but today, today I was wishing I would have kept my wits and saved a few strokes.
But I found a little something on the range yesterday.  My coach and my caddie and me, we're all trying to figure out what I can do to trust myself and see consistent golf shots, and I found a little bit on the range yesterday and came out with nothing to lose.
And I learned a lot.  My style of play is to go get it and really have nothing to lose.  I feel like I've been out there tiptoeing around a little bit, and that leads to an 80 and 9-over like yesterday.  But today I went and got it and had some confidence walking to the first tee and had a good day.
And all in all a good week.  I mean, I'm not getting to play the weekend, I'm not -- certainly not going to finish this tournament like I wanted to, but definitely going to take a lot of confidence from today.
Q. What did you bring into today based on that practice round, and anything else you may have learned that helped you to shoot what you shot?
PATTON KIZZIRE: I just found a little something in my swing.  I was getting a little bit loose with my swing, and I was able to step up there and swing aggressively and not get loose.  And I saw a few good shots early and saw them on the range yesterday and this morning, and I figured why not, just go send it and go get it and try to make some birdies and have fun and get better.  So I did that today.
Q. What to you take from this going forward?  You've had your experience here, and now you go on.  What thing do you take out of this U.S. Open that may be helping you down the road?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Oh, gosh, I played Pebble Beach for the first time.  I hadn't play in AT&T.  I've kind of avoided that.  I certainly couldn't turn down a chance to play Pebble in the U.S. Open.
But I learned a lot about the golf course and that I am able to shoot low scores in a major championship on a great golf course.  Learned that at the Masters a little bit.  I had my best major finish at the Masters, and then had my best round in a major today, I believe.  I think 3-under was my best round in a major until today.  So I'm taking confidence from that, and I know I can play.
