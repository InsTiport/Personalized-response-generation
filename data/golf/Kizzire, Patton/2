  Q. How would you describe your round today.
 PATTON KIZZIRE:   It was pretty solid.  I hit a lot of greens early, and couldn't get the ball to the hole.  I kept leaving putts short, but I had a good day.  I would have liked to have knocked in the eagle putt.  I had about a 4- or 5-footer for eagle on the last.  That would have sealed things off and made dinner taste a little better.
 5-under is not too bad.  I feel like I needed 8-or 9-under to get back in the tournament.  Maybe I can do that tomorrow.
 Q. Do you feel like you have a low one in you tomorrow?
 PATTON KIZZIRE:   A lot of guys have a low one in them, just you've got to do it.  The golf course is there for the taking the.  The wind is fairly predictable and not blowing too hard, and the golf course is in such great conditions.  The greens are so pure you feel like you can make it if you're inside 20, 30 feet.
 Q. Speaking of the golf course, when you won here, you were 17-under par; leader is 16-under now.  What's the biggest difference if the golf course or conditions from when you won to this year?
 PATTON KIZZIRE:   I think the wind was up a little bit more in 2018 when I won.  Some of the greens were a little different.  They have changed a few greens.  I think guys are continuing to get better at golf.  Each year you have to raise your standard and make a few more birdies.
