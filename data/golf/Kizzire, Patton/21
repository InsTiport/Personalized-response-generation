Q. What were you thinking the last two, three, four holes?  You were looking at the leaderboard, you kind of realized where you were at?  Obviously the more birdies you can get, the better off you're going to be.  Were you feeling some pressure because of that?
PATTON KIZZIRE: No pressure, just trying to get some birdies.  I didn't hit my best shots there towards the end.  Just part of it.
It could have come early in the tournament or late.  But I gave it a good shot, and unfortunately came up short.  But there's next week.
Q. For someone who doesn't have a lot of experience out here on the TOUR, the experience has got to be invaluable, so whatever happens, do you feel like, you know what, this was a really good tournament, my scores were good, and I gained a lot of really valuable knowledge out here?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Yeah, there's been a trend the last few years on different tours, some near misses, playing well and just not quite getting in that top spot.  So yeah, and finally breaking through on those different tours.  That's great experience for me, and I know I can use it throughout the season.
