Q. Patton, three shots better today compared to the first round.  How would you rate today's performance?
PATTON KIZZIRE: It was a little better.  I had a few nice streaks there, good birdie streaks, and I was a little more aggressive on the greens.  All in all, it was a pretty good day.  Everything was clicking pretty well.
Q. I may be presumptuous, but I'm guessing the fact you played last week, got some competition under your belt, it better prepared you for this week.  Is that accurate?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Yeah, last week was a great experience for me.  It always helps to get good reps, and it was playing very difficult, a lot of variables last week.  But I enjoy this course, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.
Q. To come from that type of course to this style of course and to have the great numbers you've put up so far, what does that say about your game as a golfer?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Well, it's in a good spot right now.  I'm playing pretty well.  I've been putting in a lot of work.  Hopefully, my game will show up on all kinds of courses.  That's what we all strive for.  That's what I'm trying to do this season.
