Q.   Patton Kizzire, playing in just your third PGA TOUR event.   You're a regular down here at Sea Island; you train out here as well, so you know the golf course as well, but 4‑under par 66, you gotta be pretty happy with that start. 
PATTON KIZZIRE:   Yeah.   Solid start.   I know the course very well, and I feel comfortable out here, and my game's been really good.   So I'm glad to be playing on the home course.

Q.   Tell me about this golf course.   You play here regularly, and you hang around a pretty class sort of group here.   How has this golf course changed when they set it up for the tournament as opposed to playing it on an everyday basis?
PATTON KIZZIRE:   You're right.   I play a lot of golf with really good players.   But the course, the greens are a lot faster.   You know, I'm used to a little slower greens, but I enjoy playing fast surface, and they've really sped the greens up, firmed them up a little bit, and it's just in really good shape.

Q.   You know your way around here, of course, you won the SEC Championship here.   Tell me, growing up in Tuscaloosa and going to Auburn, how did that happen?   Did Hudson pull you over as you're going down the highway?
PATTON KIZZIRE:   Gosh, lots of people have asked me that.   There's really not a great answer other than it seemed to be the best fit for me.   And I've fallen in love with Auburn, but you know, all my family, they're Alabama fans, and I pull for Alabama unless they're playing Auburn, you know.   I'm kind of indifferent.
But I don't mind.   When Alabama is good, it increases the competition and Auburn has gotta be good, too.   So it's fun watching some good football teams, no doubt.

Q.   And just the group that you hang out with down here, there's major champions here.   These guys have won a number of events on the PGA TOUR.   How does that benefit a young guy like yourself trying to craft his way out here hanging out with those guys?
PATTON KIZZIRE:   You know, there's a lot of guidance.   I have a lot of good instruction, fitness instruction as well; Randy Myers and Todd Anderson are really instrumental in my development.   And playing with guys like Zach Johnson and Jonathan Byrd and Harris English and Brian Harman, Hudson Swafford.   I could go on and on.   The competition level is really high; and if you don't step up, you'll get run over.
And also, you know, if you do beat the guys, you kind of feel like you can do it.   So it's a win‑win situation, and I love being down here.

Q.   I'm sure you get a lot of confidence out of that.
PATTON KIZZIRE:   Thank you very much.
