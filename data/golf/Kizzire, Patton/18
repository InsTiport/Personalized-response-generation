Q. What it's like so far?
PATTON KIZZIRE: It's fun.  The stakes are high and there's a lot of good players and it's a big event.  I'm just excited to be here and glad to have a chance to compete.  I need to get a win tomorrow.
Q. Remind me, you got in late.  Was there a high finish that squeaked you in?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Not really a high finish.  I just played just well enough in the Valspar to qualify.
Q. Are you thinking about World Ranking and that kind of stuff?
PATTON KIZZIRE: I believe I have to finish or make it to the semifinals to get in the Masters.  That is a goal of mine, to get in the Masters.  I definitely have that on my mind.
Q. Can you talk about your finish on 18, your comeback?
PATTON KIZZIRE: DÃ©jÃ  vu.  I needed a birdie and I was able to get it.  I was glad to have that opportunity to get a half.  I took advantage of that.
