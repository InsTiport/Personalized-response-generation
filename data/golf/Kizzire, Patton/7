Q. What club was it?  What did you see?
PATTON KIZZIRE: 7-iron.  Leish hit a 6 and kind of hit it a little straighter and it was behind the hole and I said I'm going to hit 7 and work it with the wind.  And I didn't really know what to tell, I told it to go but it was perfect and it just hopped and just boom.
Q. When was your last one in competition?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Last one in competition was when I was 15 down in Tampa.  AJGA tournament.
Q. Really?
PATTON KIZZIRE: All of them have been in practice rounds or playing with my friends.
Q. When was your last one, period?
PATTON KIZZIRE: Last one I had was, I guess it was at Bay Hill in the practice round, No. 2.  Which is probably my most impressive.  That's a tough hole.
Q. You seem to play well in Hawaii.  Is there just something about starting the year that you're fresh?
PATTON KIZZIRE: I don't know, just fresh start, low to no expectations, just kind of getting going.  I like the wind.  The wind's blowing you all over out there and you got to kind of manipulate it and that's how I play anyway, so I think that helps.
