  Q.  Lots of birdies on the card.  What's the story behind them?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Well, I started getting a few putts in the hole and I can't really say I played any better than the other rounds but holed a few putts, made a couple of crucial up-and-downs and you know, I'm playing all right.  So I'm getting a lot of chances.   
  
  Q.  Just one bogey this week; you must be pleased with that stat.   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Oh, definitely.  I haven't been in trouble that often to be fair.  I had a couple of good up-and-downs today.  No, I'm very pleased with that.  It's stability, too.  I'm lacking in the wedge play, too.  The putting is slowly getting up and running.  But the game as a whole is pretty good.   
  
  Q.  Start of the day, eight back.  What was the game plan going out then?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Well, you just go out and play really, just hope to get the putts rolling in and see how far you can PUSH it.   
 For a while there, I got hot but didn't finish off as well as I wanted.  It's a good score and the game is there.  I might fall a few more behind before the day is finished, but, you know, I'd like to be there and we shall see tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  What will the game plan be then for tomorrow?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  I start out the same, but if I'm in with a chance on the back nine, I usually go quite intense and give it a real go.   
  
  Q.  Playing with young Rory McIlroy, what do you think of him?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  He's a great guy.  I played with him before in the week as well.  A strong game he has and good guy.  He's nice and calm on the course.  Seems to handle himself well.  You know, he had a 4-putt out there today and just really got on with things after that.  I'm impressed and I think he has a good future ahead of him.
