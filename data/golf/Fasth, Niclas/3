  Q. 6-under, just give us your thoughts on a good start?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, fantastic. I mean, yes, I've done good work over the winter. You stand up on the first tee, first tournament, you really don't know what to expect. I mean, a bit rusty but I played a very steady, nice round of golf. Putts went in and it was a very good round.  
  
  Q. What was particularly good? Just right across the board, or anything you're particularly pleased with?  
 NICLAS FASTH: The putting was great, and also the swing changes I've done have provided much better consistency. It was a lot easier.   
  
  Q. And you worked on the swing changes over the winter?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Yes.   
  
  Q. How long have you had away?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Since Hong Kong. I literally have not played a round of golf so this is really, really nice.  
  
  Q. What did your Christmas break consist of, being away anywhere or just at home?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Away in Sweden. Call it want what you want. I do live in Britain, but I went to Sweden for 2 1/2 weeks.  
  
  Q. Batteries recharged?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, you know, you typically need a vacation after a vacation, don't you. It was nice. We went skiing. It was nice.   
  
  Q. Are you a goal-setter for the year?  
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, I want to win again. I want to get back to where I know I can play, and so results-wise, that is the first goal, to win again.   
  
  Q. You gave yourself a good chance?  
 NICLAS FASTH: We'll see. It is a good start.
