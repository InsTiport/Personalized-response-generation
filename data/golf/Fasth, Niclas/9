 Q.  Tell us, in match play the momentum is key.  You got off to a ridiculous start.  Tell us about that. 
 NICLAS FASTH:  Well, I holed a lovely bunker shot, short-range on the first, but still, that's a big break.  Yeah, good birdie putt.  I made an eagle, and then I birdied the next.  So all of a sudden, 2-up.  I was playing well, and it's hard to come back then. 

 Q.  Give us a sense of how you felt this morning.  Did you think it was going to be a good day before the match even started? 
 NICLAS FASTH:  You don't really know.  In an 18-hole match, anybody has a good day, he's going to win it.  I mean, even if you play well, your opponent may play well, too.  You don't know.  You just go about your business.  But like you said, momentum is really key.  You win a hole, you make sure you don't lose the next.  You want to build on it. 

 Q.  We know that you love to compete.  You show us that with your emotions on the course.  Is match play right up your street? 
 NICLAS FASTH:  I love it.  I don't even know what's the key to playing match play, but liking it is a good start, isn't it?  And I do like the competition, yes.
