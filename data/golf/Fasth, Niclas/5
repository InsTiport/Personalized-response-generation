 Q. Mixed bag there at the end, you had the fantastic eagle at 11 and got you right into contention and a couple of dropped shots has made it in the balance now, I suppose, isn't it?
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, I guess we'll see here, if Huldahl screws it up, too. Good tournament, but I wasn't playing great. I was playing pretty decent golf, a little bit of a mixed bag this week.
 But what's happened is the putting has come around, and I changed to a new Odyssey putter. Worked a lot with the Callaway boys this Tuesday, I mean, all day, and I putted fantastic all week. And that's from putting really, really poorly last week.

 Q. Well, you didn't this afternoon. You were holing a lot of good ones. 
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, I have all week. I'll be on the phone thanking the guys because it really worked out.

 Q. What was the shot you played on 11 for the eagle? 
 NICLAS FASTH: I had about 70 yards, lob-wedge, just by the pin, skipped back and went in. That was obviously a nice surprise that it actually goes in. Doesn't happen often.

 Q. You could feel the momentum at that point, couldn't you. 
 NICLAS FASTH: Yeah, I was standing in the fairway, feeling all right, but feeling I'll need to make a couple more birdies at least. It was nice obviously and made things a whole lot more interesting for a little while there. 

 Q. Imagine you are pretty infuriated with yourself 16, 17, joint leader at the time. 
 NICLAS FASTH: Normally if I'm comfortable with my shots, I don't screw up like that, simply, but I am not quite there yet. I haven't been really comfortable with shots all week, and done well to hang in there really and putted well. It has not been bad but just not as consistent as you'd like. 

 Q. Well, it's not over yet. 
 NICLAS FASTH: We shall see.
