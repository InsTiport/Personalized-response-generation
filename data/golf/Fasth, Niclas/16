   NICLAS FASTH:  I thought I was feeling better today but it was absolutely horrific. I have been dizzy all day and thought I was going to fall over. No chance to focus at all. I have been all over the show today and no chance to do anything about it. Then towards the end it got to my stomach as well so I feel absolutely terrible. 

 Q.  But only three shots back? 
 NICLAS FASTH:  That is hardly what I was hoping for and I will have to feel a lot better to be able to give it any sort of chance tomorrow. I can't believe I got round with any kind of score. 

 Q.  Is there a danger of not playing tomorrow? 
 NICLAS FASTH:  There is but I certainly hope not. If I feel like this then I am not sure I will be able to go out but hopefully I will feel better tomorrow.
