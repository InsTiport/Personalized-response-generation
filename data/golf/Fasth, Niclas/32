Q.  Two shots back at the moment, Henrik?

HENRIK STENSON:  We're in good position.  We're happy with this, and obviously wanted a putt or two extra to drop in, especially for me today, and we just played good and put a pretty solid score up on the leaderboard.  So yeah, in good shape for tomorrow I think.
Q.  Niclas, tough day in the conditions as well, so 63, pretty pleased with that?

NICLAS FASTH:  Yeah, sure.  You want to go out there and play for it and see how many you can get, but it certainly wasn't our day out there today.  But we hung in and did a good job I think, and to get it to 9 after we were like 4 under after 11 or 12 today, so we did a really good job of it, and now we're right back in it and feel good about tomorrow.

We played a really good foursomes yesterday, where it was solid.  Not brilliant, but very solid and 5 under, we'll be in with a chance tomorrow.  And best case, we'll knock in another few putts.
Q.  Your tee shot on 16, great tee shot there wasn't?

HENRIK STENSON:  As I said today, I didn't do too much today, but it's nice to step in with a good shot, important birdie there.  We were in trouble off the tee on 17, and Niclas made a birdie there on 17.  So I think we fought pretty well out there.  And it was just that last putt on 18, you always feel like it should have dropped, but we'll save that one for tomorrow when it really matters.
