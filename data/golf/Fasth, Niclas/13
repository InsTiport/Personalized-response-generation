   NICLAS FASTH:  I am quite disappointed really. I didn't play as well as I would have liked. My driving and putting were very poor today. I felt good about my game in general coming into the tournament and played well on and off but didn't putt well enough and my driving was poor on the back nine. I felt I left a good score out there. 
 I enjoy the Majors. I've had a good few weeks and I had much more in me today but too many bad drives. I holed a few good ones in the middle so it's very frustrating. I think if I can get under par for the weekend that would be a good target. Hope I can do that and sneak a few more and get into contention.
