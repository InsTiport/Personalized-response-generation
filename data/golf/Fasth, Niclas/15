   NICLAS FASTH:  It was a brave effort. I played absolutely fantastic today and felt I gave it a good strong go. I felt I was a little unlucky as I was going really strongly when we had the first break and came out and made my only two bogeys of the day. That was rather disappointing and it was long way back after that. But I gave it a good go. I left some eight or ten footers on the edge and it didn't really happen today like it needs to to win a tournament. Nearly, but not quite. Considering how I was feeling it was not bad. I just tried to pull through and nearly got it done today.
