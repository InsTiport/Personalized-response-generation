  Q.  You started well, finished well, just a little too much to do maybe, was it?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  No, it wasn't, because it turned into a very tight battle out there.  So it was up to anybody.  And I was effectively lacking one birdie somewhere, and then I totally messed up on the last hole.  Less than happy with the club chosen for me on the tee.  I never had a chance to go for it.  I felt I just gave it away.  Henrik birdied the last, it might not have mattered for that purpose, but it still mattered.   
 It was a good effort today.  It was a good effort this week.  I've been playing pretty good, and my putting, especially over the weekend, was pretty good as well.   
  
  Q.  Was that a miscommunication between you and Dave on the tee?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Let's call it that.   
  
  Q.  Do you have the final say, do players normally have the final say?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Of course.   
  
  Q.  What did you actually end up hitting?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  3-wood.
