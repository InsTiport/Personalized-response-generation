  Q.  A terrific round of golf, I understand there's a problem with your putter.   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Yeah, it was a bit interesting, it was just a fraction loose but still you don't want any problems with your putter, do you.  So it's a little tricky.  I didn't have much choice really.   
  
  Q.  Did you call an official just to check the situation?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Yeah, I wasn't sure about the rule really.  If you damage a club in anger, say, then usually you can't use it but I don't have a clue what's happened here.   
 It's just a little bit loose so I have something to sort out now for sure.   
  
  Q.  3-under on the front nine --   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Well, you never know.  I didn't putt bad, but I didn't make many more birdies after that.  Who knows, who knows.   
  
  Q.  How are you feeling about your game in general?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  Good.  It has been good all year really.  Some rounds I've been scoring well, some I haven't.  This week is all right.  I'm really happy about how the game feels.  It's certainly developing better and I played really well.   
  
  Q.  What about this course, is it one where you saw the golf course, you thought, "I fancy my chances here"?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  I don't know, it's tough.  But I usually play all right in wind, and we are certainly getting a lot of wind here.  It's a tough course and you need to get up-and-down quite a few times every round and usually suits me as well, so I guess it suits me then.   
  
  Q.  What's the game plan tomorrow?   
 NICLAS FASTH:  I'll just keep playing really.  I'll have to have a pretty good day to catch up with the leaders.  But the game is strong enough, so if I get on a run, I can do something.
