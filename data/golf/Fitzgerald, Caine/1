Q.   Talk about your experience here this week.   I know it probably wasn't exactly what you were looking for, but overall the feeling? 
CAINE FITZGERALD:   It was amazing.   The practice rounds, playing with Zack Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Keegan Bradley, Davis love, guys I look at as superstars.   It was amazing to get that opportunity. 
And then to tee it up on in my first major Tour event, can't beat the experience.

Q.   Make you want it a little more next year going back and get the chance to do this again?
CAINE FITZGERALD:   It's kind of like the PNC, I've played in six of them.   It was a process, learned how to be comfortable, how to perform, and just how to do different things. 
Both days in this, I struggled a little early, got comfortable and relaxed, finished bad both days and made it look a little worse than maybe it was.   But, yeah, same thing going to PNC.   Obviously we all want to get here and just being here makes it just that much more so that I want to get back.
