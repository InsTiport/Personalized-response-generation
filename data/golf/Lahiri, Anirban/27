Q. Pretty good round out there.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, absolutely.  I'm really happy with the way I started today.  I was a bit unsure of how I was going to go today.  Obviously still feeling all the travel from coming from Asia last week.  But really happy with the way I hit the ball.  I don't think I missed a green all day.  I felt really good out there.
Q. What's it like playing in a situation like desert golf, where everything's pretty much a dome and you got to make birdies all the way through.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: This is a good golf course.  I think that I like the way this particular golf course sets up.  You've got to put it in play off the tee and then you have a lot of opportunities.  So, I think it's good, it's good for people to come out and watch, because you see a lot of birdies.
Q. Haven't played since the Hero World Challenge, right?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: No, I played last week on the Asian Tour.
Q. So what kind of things have you done in the off season between Hero and here?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I got a lot of rest, to start.  I was playing three different tours last year and I was absolutely ragged by the end of the year.  So I got some rest in, did some work on the body, got some good gym time in, and spent a couple of weeks with my coach before I started out last week.  So, yeah, I feel ready to go.
Q. Next two courses that you've got, you've seen them -- did you see them earlier this week?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yes, I played the Stadium Course, I went and mapped out the Nicklaus Tournament Course.  I got in on Monday afternoon, so I don't think it was a good idea for me to play 54 before I teed up.  So we'll find out.  They look pretty good.  They're similar, if you put yourself in a good position, there's a few wedges and a few birdies to be made.
