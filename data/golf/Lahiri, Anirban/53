 Q.  What are your thoughts overall on your round today?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I'm happy with the way I hit it.  Quite frustrated with my score.  I didn't really make anything inside ten feet.  So it's kind of one of those rounds that could have been, I think, but I'm going to have to play lights out tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did you feel the course was gettable?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, you had to drive it well, and I did that.  But I just didn't take my opportunities.  I gave myself quite a few, but a little disappointed not to score.  I scored poorly today.   
 Q.  Only a few strokes off the lead, what is your mentality going out tomorrow?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: You're going to have to come out with a hot start if you want to have a chance, because there are birdies on this golf course.  And these guys are good.  You've got to play great.  That's what I'm going to try to do.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts overall on the course over the first three days?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I love the golf course.  Said it since Wednesday, probably continue to say it for many, many years.  I love the track.  I think it's a great test.  Gives you lots of opportunities, but very penal if you do miss it.  And I think that's how a golf course should be set up.  It should reward good golf, and this golf course does exactly that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Not really, I don't really think that it affected me that much.  In fact, I was lucky that I managed to go home and I had about two and a half hours to just put my feet up and relax and come back out.  Always helps when you play good in the morning.  I was a little disappointed with the afternoon, but I'll take it.   
 Q.  Do you think you have to make any changes?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm going to make more putts tomorrow.
