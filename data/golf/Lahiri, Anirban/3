 Q.  67 to get started, can you tell us about your round?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I think first we got really nice conditions this morning, so it was important to go out there and take advantage of that.  Obviously love being here.  I love playing here.  I played well here, so lots of positive memories.  I feel like my game has been getting better over the last couple of weeks.  It's not been a great six or seven months but it's always good coming here.  I hit the ball pretty good, I think my yardage control was very good.  I hit a lot of balls pin-high, which is really important out here.  Played the par-5s better.  So, yeah, I'm pretty happy with my round today.  Probably could have made a putt or two more.  But, yeah, I'll take it.   
 Q.  When did you get in?  Monday night during that tornado?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: No, somehow I slept through all of that.  I did get here -- I got here on Monday afternoon and got some work in on Monday afternoon, did some range work and just wanted to get really comfortable.  Like I said I feel like my game has been trending in the right direction.  So I wanted to lock that in.  I slept through that.  I heard about it Tuesday morning.  But I was out for the count.   
 Q.  Bet it wouldn't shock you around this place, right?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, when you come here you expect some weather.  It's always a little bit of electricity, some rain.  We were kind of scrambling to finish, because we didn't know if there was something behind us.  But lucky to not get hit today.  The forecast was not looking very pretty.  But I think we skirted a lot of it.   
 Q.  What do you like about your game?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Just generally in all the departments seem to be coming together.  It's been a while since I've been able to say that.  So it's nice.  I feel like my driving has gotten better.  I've been working on my iron play, some technique stuff, some equipment stuff.  And I think I'm in a good place.
