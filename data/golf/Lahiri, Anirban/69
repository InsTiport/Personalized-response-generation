  ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   That was really something.   It was a really tough match.   Victor is such a great player.   I'm really happy I played my AGame today?

Q.   That was a wonderful victory, wasn't it, to move ahead, and I know you had topsy‑turvy moments but you looked in control a lot of the time. 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I played really solid today.   I kept looking at the leaderboard and knew the team needed to bring home a point and I'm glad I managed to do that.   Hopefully the boys can just have one final push and keep the Cup at home.

Q.   I know I said this yesterday but let's refer back to what you said about 5‑nil and a fairy tale possibility?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   I think we could do a Europe on them this year; we could go Medinah, Malaysia.

Q.   Was there genuinely all that positivity in the team room coming into the singles?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think yes.   Yesterday was a day that could have been even better.   At one point in time, we were not down in any match and up in four.   So we knew that we had picked our games up from where it was on the first day, and the boys are really pumped up.   I think we managed to get everybody riled up and really ready to fire today and I'm glad to see everyone has played so well.

Q.   And I appreciate you've had some very good days in the world of golf but this might be right up there I guess? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think so.   I think another spectacular hour and a half could make it one of the best days so far.
