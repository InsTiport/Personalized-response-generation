Q. 12-under, but there was a little bit of everything going on in your second round today.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, it was a lot happening out there.  I got off to a good start and then lost my concentration around the turn.  Got it back and then lost it again.  So, yeah, it was up-and-down, I definitely left a few shots out there.
Q. To birdie the last must taste good though.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It was relief more than anything.  You don't want to make 6 or 7 from the fairway and after walking off with a 3-putt on 8, then it was nice to get that in, so, yeah.
Q. We spoke yesterday of the jet lag.  How are you feeling energy-wise now?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think I'm a lot better.  I felt pretty much like I was back on time last evening.  Although I did -- I think I started hitting it a little shorter towards the end of my round again.  But I think it's getting back to normal now.
