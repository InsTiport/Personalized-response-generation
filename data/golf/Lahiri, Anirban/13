Q. Round of 65 at the Memorial and you're in at 10-under.  Do you think that will hold up?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I'm not so sure.  I think there's a lot of good players out there.  And there's a few birdies to be made on the back nine.  But anything is possible, obviously.  It's not the easiest finishing stretch.  And there's probably a storm coming.  I don't know.  I'm happy with my effort, that's all I can control.  And I'll be sitting and watching from the clubhouse.
Q. How about the up-and-down on the last, that was pretty impressive?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I put myself in a bad situation there off the tee.  Would have loved to give myself a look at birdie.  But from that spot to get up and down was pretty special, yeah.
Q. Are you happy to be in the clubhouse with the weather?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I would have liked maybe four or five holes more, actually.  Because I was playing really good.  And I could have probably made a couple more birdies.  But like I say, I'm really happy with the way I played.  I felt really relaxed out there.
Disappointed, actually, not to birdie 15, 16.  I hit a couple of shots that came really close to being very good.  But then that's the Memorial for you.  That's this golf course.  You take what you get and then you stay happy with that.
Q. Are you scheduled to try to qualify anywhere tomorrow?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I don't know if this gets me in.  But, no, I'm not qualifying tomorrow.  I pulled out of that about a week ago.  I think my next start will be the Travelers.
Q. Anything you did specific after your round yesterday coming into today that helped you get to what you were able to do today?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think as the week's progressed, I've gotten more comfortable.  The first day, as well, I think I hit it good but just got out of position a few times.  And then Friday was critical for me.  I think I putted really well.  And that's been probably the scratchy part of my game.  Once I got that confidence, I wasn't putting that much pressure on myself to hit it every time.
There are holes out here you have to respect and you try to make those 10, 15-footers and if you do you get a score together.  And I think that's what I did over the weekend and just tried to stay away from the bad spots.  I think this is one of those courses that you've just got to leave yourself in the right spot.
Q. What was really working for you today?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Nothing, really.  I haven't played well out here the last couple of months.  I've been pretty harsh on myself.  I've beat myself up pretty bad.
And coming into this week I just decided to be nice to myself and go out there and enjoy my golf, which I found wasn't happening as often as it should.  And it's been great weather.  And it's a great golf course.  So I just went out and had fun.
Q. I imagine that's easier said than done, how did you make sure that you stayed positive?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, it's not easy.  I've probably -- if you look at my last five starts, I don't think I finished better than 60th.  And I definitely feel that I'm a better player than that.  And sometimes when you push yourself harder, it works against you.  And I feel that was what was happening.  I just tried to lay back and just stick to doing what I do well, which is just stay calm and relaxed on the golf course.  I think I was -- I wasn't in a good frame of mind and I think that's what's changed this week.
Q. Where you were at Hilton Head, you had a glimpse there, and you talked about pushing back into the Presidents Cup mix.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: That's the thing, there's all those things to push for.  And that's one of the things that I'm trying to back away from.  Obviously I want to be on the Presidents Cup team.  There's no way I wouldn't want to be on Nick's team.  I have unfinished business.  I've said that before.  I would like nothing better than go out there and get points.
There's so much things you can push for.  You can push for the U.S. Open.  I haven't played a major or WGC this year.  Like I said, I beat myself up a little bit because I played ten consecutive majors and now I'm not in any major yet.  I should get into the last, hopefully.  But that kind of plays on your mind.  You feel like you're going backwards.  So you just have to gather yourself and go back to what you have been doing.  And I think that's where I find myself.  So I'm just doing that, just going to focus on my golf, be good to myself and let the results take care of themselves.
