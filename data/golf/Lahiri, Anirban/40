Q. Thoughts on your round today.  5-under.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I got off to a good start, what I was looking for, really.  And just on the back nine was terrible on the greens.  I think I gave myself a lot of chances on 10, 11, 13, 14, just didn't make anything.
And got a little frustrated I think after the 14th miss.  And we were standing on the tee for a long time, because a lot of groups got held up because it was drivable.  And I just lost my concentration sitting around.  Got a little stiff.
Made a bogey on 15.  That's not what I needed.
So I was happy that I made birdie on 17.
And saved a good par on 18.
But I just gave easily gave two or three shots away on the back nine.  Disappointed, given how I started, but I guess I just have to do a little better on the weekend.
Q. Talk us through that eagle.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I hit a good drive.  Anything on that fairway is good.  It was just an in between number between my four and 5-iron.  So I just decided to kind of hit a low 5-iron and try and run it up that slope and I hit it absolutely perfect, obviously, nice to tap that in and be 4-under after 4.  That's 4-under after 5, that's the kind of start you're looking for.
So I'm going to need to do that again tomorrow and continue it.  I think it was the way the course is playing, with no rough, it all down to your putting.  Guys are shooting 10-, 11-under, because you're holing those 10, 15 footers.  And I think I did some of that on the front nine, but back nine was just absolutely dry.
So, just got to putt a little bit better.  I'm feeling good, obviously, with my game, energy level is good, which I'm happy about.  So hopefully I'll have another big weekend like I did at the Malaysian Open.
