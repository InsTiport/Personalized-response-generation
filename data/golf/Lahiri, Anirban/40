 Q.  It's an interesting last five holes for you.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'll take it.  I haven't been finishing very well, so that was good to at least finish with a few birdies, obviously.   
17 was not fun.  I misjudged my club and didn't make a good swing.  But it was nice to make birdie.   
I haven't -- I've been playing good but I haven't made birdies in bunches.  It's just been bogey-free or one bogey and three, four, five birdies.  But it was nice to -- I think I made eight birdies today.  So that was nice.  Because you have to be in a birdie mood on this golf course, otherwise you're not going to catch anyone.   
As it is, I don't think a 67 is going to gain much ground.  So I'm going to have to make as many or more birdies tomorrow and try and keep a clean card.   
 Q.  But overall are you still in a good position for the last day?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I would have liked to have been in a better position, but having started weak, I think this is not a bad place to be.  Like I said, I feel like I'm playing well, so hopefully I can get a really deep round.   
 Q.  Energy level is good?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, it's good.  It's surprisingly good.  Malaysia has been good.  It's not been as bad as it can be.  It's nice.  Go have a shower, go get some needles in my leg and release some tired muscles, but, yeah, I'm fine.
