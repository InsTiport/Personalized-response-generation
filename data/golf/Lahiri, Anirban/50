 Q.  If we can get your views of your pairing with Thongchai against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think it was quite natural for Thongchai and me to be teamed up.  Honestly, I can't ask for a better partner.  He's one of the most consistent golfers out there.  Even in a stellar lineup like we have this week, I think he's probably one of the most consistent.   
Going into foursomes, I think I have a pretty good feeling about it because we played some yesterday, and we played really good.  He's hitting his irons fantastic.  I seem to be putting good, so that sets up well for us.   
As for Jimmy and Rickie, Jimmy's a good friend and Rickie's a great player.  Everyone out here can play golf, but tomorrow we're looking to get the job done.   
 Q.  How's the week been so far?  Lots of new experiences.  We've been picking up bits and pieces from here inside the team room, lots of fun and games, and you've been kind of revealed as one of the most humorous guys by your captain?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, at least someone thinks I'm funny.  No, it's nice to keep the mood light.  It's important for everyone to be positive and chirpy and just communicate and have a laugh.  Just relax a little bit, because once we go out there all of us are just focused on making sure that Presidents Cup, now that it's come to Asia stays in Asia and stays with the internationals.  That's going to be there for tomorrow for all of us.  That is exactly what -- not even for the 12 of us, for all 16 of us.  The captain's and the vice captains, the players, the wives, the support team.  It's a very focused mood.  At the same time it's quite lively and humorous, so it's a good mix.   
 Q.  How is the (Indiscernible)?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I haven't played much, but I think me and Jason got handed by Branden and Lewis, they're pretty good.  So hopefully by the end of the week we get even with them.   
 Q.  What has been the key message from Captain Price in the team room the last couple of days?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I think he's quite positive with the outlook of the team.  I think all of us are in great form.  He could have made any of us play tomorrow.  It's a pity that Charl is a little under the weather.  But the message has been simple.  It's been to go out there and enjoy ourselves and to just be gritty and fight it out, not give the Americans any free holes.  Just hang in there.   
I think the way all of us are playing, we are all pretty confident with our games right now.  It's just about gelling tomorrow, and I think so far we've bonded really well over the last three days, whether it's Korean food, whether it's table tennis or whatever as that goes on in the team room and in the team suite in the hotel.  It's been fantastic.   
 Q.  You don't get too much match play in Asia.  Has the EurAsia Cup been a positive influence?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Absolutely.  It was a very important event for me last year to play the EurAsia Cup to get that experience, to also experience the highs and lows because in match play it's all about momentum.  You can lose momentum, and unless you wrangle it back, the match can slip away.  The opposite is true if you're ahead.  You want to just make sure you keep your foot on the pedal.   
Also last EurAsia Cup went that way and then that way and then that way.  So it was a very important experience.  After that I have played a little more match play, so in that sense, I definitely feel more prepared for this.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy it?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I absolutely love it.  I've always played a lot of team sports as a kid, and I got along with pretty much everyone, and all of us, we already feel like a family.  We're all calling each other names and pulling each other's legs.  We're all supporting each other 100% through everything.  So that's what you need this week.  I think we're in a position where we're all just waiting for the gun to go off and tee it off tomorrow.   
 Q.  What is your first memory of the Presidents Cup, watching it on TV and that kind of thing?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Probably the one that was shared because of darkness and Tiger and playing it out until there was no chance of playing anymore.  Just it's special.  For me it's like my Ryder Cup.  It's as big as it gets.  It's my opportunity to shine some light on Indian golf, on Asian golf, on my own ability as a golfer and my people.   
More than anything else, now we haven't had the best runs, so it's a great opportunity for me to be a part of something special and rest that back from them.   
 Q.  Do you feel like there is optimism among people who have been in these Presidents Cups before because the points change and it's a new start?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, absolutely.  I was talking to Adam and we were talking a lot about the years past and this year.  And even someone like him who has been there for eight Presidents Cups, he feels really positive because there are a lot of fresh faces.   
It's probably nice to have some rookies on the team.  We're all young and we're all fearless.  We haven't experienced the low yet when it comes to the Presidents Cup, and I think that's going to work to our favor, whether it's Danny or Sangmoon who are of Korean decent.  I think we're going to have a 13th player in the crowd also we hope and things like that.   
There is a lot of positivity, whether it's the points change or all the other factors.  Hopefully it just culminates into a lead going into Friday for now.   
 Q.  Couple of nights ago I believe you all sat together and saw the 1998 film?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, we saw bits of it.  We've done a lot of stuff as a team.  Lot of exercises where we just spent a lot of time together.  Obviously it's an exercise and it's fantastic because you get to know how another person thinks, dreams and ambitions and wishes and fears as well of all your teammates.  And it's very important because you know when to jump in and be there for them; you know when to just step out of the way and let them do their own thing.  That's what team golf and match play are all about.   
 Q.  You're the first team to interview on the Presidents Cup filed, and not a lot of people out here know too much about Indian golf.  Have you been asked a lot of questions about that?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, yeah.  Whether it's Jason or Adam or Steven, all the guys I've played with this week Charl, Louis, Brenden, Danny, everybody's curious to know what it is back home.  How many courses do we have?  What is the strength of the golf as a sport?  How much is it watched or talked about or how much does the media highlight it?   
So it's been good.  It's been good to be able to share that, and also it's a matter to get it right that I'm here.  But it means nothing if I don't play well.  Obviously I've got everything to play for and lots to look forward to.   
 Q.  You love all kinds of food?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yes.   
 Q.  How was the Korean food?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It was fantastic.  We went out last night.  K.J. hosted a traditional Korean barbecue dinner for us, which was endless.  We had so much food that we couldn't even get to the last couple of courses, but it was fantastic.  It was delicious, and it was a lot of fun to sit down with the team and have a glass of wine and laugh and have some great food.   
 Q.  What was the highlight?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: The highlight was probably when they brought in an octopus and made stew of it in front of us.  I think there were some pretty funny faces around the table right there.   
 Q.  You talk about you guys calling each other names.  What are some of the names you've been called?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: No, no, that's something we do -- we do those things behind closed doors and behind the ropes on the golf course.  So I think we're going to let that be.  Let's just, needless to say, it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  What has a day in Anirban been this week?  Your coach is here, your wife's here?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yes, my wife and coach are here.  Obviously this week is a very quiet affair.  I haven't even switched my phone on from when I leave the hotel to when I get back.  When I do it's probably only to message my parents.  I was just shut down, and you just want to spend as much time with the team.   
Everything is focused towards going out there and playing our best and just doing whatever it takes to hold that cup on Sunday.  I think all of us are dedicated to this.  I think the passion is showing among all of us.   
 Q.  Anirban, there's been a lot of attention on you, and whether I've spoken to the commissioner whether it's Jack or Nick Price, they have nice words to say about you, good words to say about your game, your personality, and the way you've carried yourself, et cetera.  A year ago you were very distant from this position.  I mean, does that give you a lot of pleasure?  You always said that you feel like you belong.  Have you felt you belong and how has that feeling been?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It's been good.  Obviously I've made some friends out here.  Not just among the internationals.  I have some friends who I'm competing against this week as well.  It's a small community.  We golfers, we spend a lot of time out on TOUR among each other and spend a lot of time with each other.  Personally, for me, I've taken all of it in a learning stead, just trying to gather as much information and learn and soak in all the experiences.   
But at the same time, I'm focused on what I need to do.  Definitely believe that I belong here and I think it will be good evidence if I can put up a good few points for my team.  But it's obviously nice to hear some of my seniors whether it's Mr. Finchem or Captain Price or some of my other friends.   
 Q.  Jack Nicklaus?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, Jack Nicklaus.  So I guess I'm doing some things right and I need to keep doing that.  Hopefully I keep moving in the same direction.  Yes, I have come a fair distance in the last year, but I think the important thing is going to be to maintain the direction in which I move.   
 Q.  How do you rate being here this week among the stuff that you've done to this point?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: There is nothing that compares.  Nothing else comes close to this because we don't often get a chance to play for something greater than yourself.  You don't often get a chance to represent something greater than your country, which in itself is one of the greatest honors that you can have.  And to be able to share that with a bunch of people who are very special in their own right, it's difficult to compare that with anything else.   
Obviously the next four days will determine the whether the experience is a great experience or one to cherish and share with your grand kids.  And hopefully that happens.   
 Q.  A couple people this week have asked me about meditation and how much does it work for golfers.  Have other people asked you so far?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, there have been a few people who have been curious.  It's a very individual thing.  It's an individual thing.  Everybody has their own techniques of relaxing or getting focused or whatever you want to call it.  Everyone who is here this week, all 24 of us are great players in our own right.  So there are some who will ask me, and I'll be very happy to share, and there are some who have their own go-tos, and you have to respect that.   
So for me, it works.  It's something that I'm going to continue to do.  And if there is anyone else who would like to find out, I'd be very happy to share it.   
 Q.  Has there been one occasion this week where someone on the team has said something truly inspirational?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yes, there has been a few things whether it's been Captain Price when we had our first team meeting on Monday night or whether it's Adam.  There have been a couple of messages that we have received from certain individuals.   
Again, I'm not at liberty to reveal that.  It's not in my place, it's Captain Price's place to reveal that.  There have been a lot of things that we've heard and read this week that has motivated us.  Not that we need it, but it helps when you get that extra fire to go out there tomorrow and just compete.   
 Q.  Anything on the dress of the uniform or the avatars that you guys are wearing?  It's so Korean with so many computer games here.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I think it's a really fun thing that they've done.  I think it adds a lot of humor as well, because we're all ribbing each other.  We pretty much all of us don't look like that, so it's a little bit different from how we actually look, but it's not very different from how we'd all like to look.   
So there is a little bit of ribbing going on there but it is nice.  We have these fantastic poker chips they've made for us to give out to the fans.  It's these kind of things that are great to connect with a larger mass of people.  It's been a lot of fun.
