 Q.  Tell us about your round.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It was a bit disappointing.  I think there's no wind, it's quite soft; so it was gettable.  And on the front nine, I just started out weak.  Missed a whole lot of putts inside eight feet, so that cost me quite a bit.  I'm happy with the way I played on the back nine.  Obviously playing good, so hopefully just make a few more putts.   
 Q.  It's another three more days of competition.  Are you off to the putting green right now?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm going to grab a quick bite and then head out and hit some putts.  Honestly I'm not doing much wrong, but if I can do some things a little bit better, just tighten it up and not drop shots, I have a chance of catching up with the guys ahead, because there's lots of birdies being made today.   
 Q.  Can you just tell us about the course today, because there's a lot of rain yesterday?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, with all the rain, it's not playing very short.  I mean, it's definitely longer than it was.  But you also don't miss as many fairways.  If you pitch it on the fairway, it pretty much plugs and stops, and we're playing preferred lies.  So around the greens, it can help you if you need to, you know, stop it a little bit quicker.   
So when you're chipping, it's a little easier and just the greens are holding.  In years past, you hit it from the rough and they bounce over or wouldn't hold the green but that's happening now.  So you're going to see fewer dropped shots because of that.
