Q. Great position for Sunday.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, happy with the way I played today.  Obviously disappointed, left a few putts out there coming in.  But all in all a good day.  I think the course played its hardest today, so I'm happy with the way I played.
Q. Only four off the lead, that's got to give you a lot of confidence?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Absolutely.  Like I said, I got it to 7 and the last six holes, I didn't play my best.  So I'm a little disappointed.  Thought I could have pushed harder to get to 8 or 9.
But obviously tomorrow, still giving myself an outside chance, so hopefully I can go out there and play my best.
Q. What do you need to change tomorrow?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think on a course like this, this is the third day in a row that we've had a different wind.  So honestly, I have no idea what to expect tomorrow in terms of the conditions.  Obviously the course is getting a lot firmer.  The greens are still, for me, left a few putts short -- I think at the end of the day, it's going to be about not making mistakes.  If you don't drop a shot, there are plenty of opportunities for you to make birdie.  I'm just hoping I can put a bogey-free round together.
