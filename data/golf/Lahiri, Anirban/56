  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: I think I played quite good today.  I just missed one green, but when you have 35 putts in a round, it's not a good sign.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: Three three-putts actually.  I three-putted 5, three-putted 13 and 17.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: No, like I said, I played well.  The 13th I hit it 25 feet.  I mean, it was a realistic birdie chance.  14th, yes, I missed a really small putt on 13, and I think got upset and hit a bad drive on 14 that cost me the bogey.  You can't hit it in the bunkers, and I did.  I didn't have any shot, chipped it out, and it was always going to be uphill to make par from there.  That's all right. I think I played really well.  15th hole I hit it 12 feet.  16th hole I hit it 15 feet.  17th hole I hit it about 30 feet.  18th hole I hit it about 20 feet, and those four holes I took nine putts.  You can't really score -- I don't think I played badly, but it's obviously extremely disappointing because I think I was -- my game has been right up there, but just need to get my confidence back on the greens, I think.  I don't think I'm doing much wrong, so should be a simple fix.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: I mean, it's a tough stretch.  Everybody has to play well on -- that's probably the hardest stretch on the golf course anyways, but you look at what I've done.  I haven't hit it out of bounds.  I haven't hit it in the rough.  I've just missed two four-footers -- one two-footer, one four-footer at 13, and you don't do that here.  It's hard enough -- 17. Honestly, in my mind, I've only played one hole badly, which was 14, and when you hit it in the trap, you take a bogey.  It happens out here.  But otherwise I've played pretty solid, so like I said, it's disappointing when you shoot yourself in the foot when it comes to scoring.  I mean, I feel like I'm playing well enough to go deep.  I should have been in the 60s today at least, at worst, so it's disappointing, yeah.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: Nothing.  I mean, I've got -- I'm enjoying myself.  No, I am playing good.  I'm enjoying myself.  I think the course suits my eye, and I just need to go out there and play happy golf.  I think I got a little unhappy after I missed a two-footer.  It usually does that to you.  I'm just trying to avoid making silly mistakes because I'm playing well enough to make four, five birdies out there every day.  I'll try and keep a clean sheet like I did -- well, not yesterday, round 2, and that should help.   Q.  Despite missing a fairway (inaudible) the last stretch (inaudible)?  ANIRBAHN LAHIRI: It's not a problem for me.  I don't know why you keep saying it's a problem.  It's not a problem.  I actually made one bad swing and I hit two bad putts.  The holes are not a problem.  If I made a bad swing on 1, I would have made bogey.  If I hit a bad putt on 3, I would have made bogey.  It's not the holes.  If I make a mistake, then it's my mistake, it's not the holes.  It just happened to happen on that stretch.
