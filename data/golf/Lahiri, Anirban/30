Q. Thoughts on the round?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It was very disappointing.  I think for foursomes, the whole point is for both of us to keep it on the fairway and hit a lot of greens and take our opportunities.  I don't think we did that very well today.  Too many holes where either I put Wu out of position or he put me out of position.  It's hard to recover from there.  We lost a few holes to pars, and that's what you can't really do in this format.
So, it's quite disappointing.  I don't think we played that bad to lose 5 & 4, but I think we lost three or four holes in the last six.  It slipped away really quickly.  Unfortunately you have to play good around the bend here.  All the matches, they are pretty much being decided between holes 8 and 14 in terms of the momentum swing.  That's the stretch I played badly yesterday, I played badly today.
So I guess tomorrow is redemption today.  We are going to be a few points back, obviously.  It's going to take a big effort, and I'm definitely going to show up.
Q. This was Wu's first time playing the EurAsia Cup.  How did he play?  Was nervous out there?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think it's always hard when it's your first time.  I experienced it at The Presidents Cup.  Even playing the EurAsia Cup two years back.  It's not easy, especially foursomes.  He's a really good player.  He's a fantastic ball-striker, great golfer.
Obviously it's been a tough week for both of us.  But I'm sure we will bounce back from our experiences.
