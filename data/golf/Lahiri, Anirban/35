Q. You must be pleased with that round you put in.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm more relieved than anything else.  I've been playing well but just haven't come up with a good score.  And I played pretty much like I've been playing but I made a few more putts today.
Slightly disappointed to leave a couple of shots out there coming in, but great round and I'm happy that it's come today and I've got a chance to move up tomorrow.
Q. Seems like it comes down to one or two shots, like what happened on the 8th, double-bogey there yesterday and same again today.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I know, funny.  I mean, I haven't made too many doubles in the last two or three months, actually, and to do it on a par 5 from the fairway on each occasion is ironic, how sometimes it's easy to mess it up from a good situation.
Yeah, it's disappointing obviously.  But I did a lot of good things, as well, so I'm going to focus on that and try to do more of that tomorrow.
Q. How do you turn things around after shooting 3-over yesterday to come out and shoot a 6-under; how do you do it?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I haven't been playing well.  Yesterday I just got hit by some exhaustion, I just think in the middle of the round.  I got fatigued.  My mind was a little bit muddled for about an hour, hour and a half.  Made a lot of errors like the double yesterday on 8, and you make mental errors on a golf course like this, you're going to drop a lot of shots.  Unfortunately, you know, just dug myself a hole there yesterday but I'm trying to get out of it.  Halfway there I guess.  Maybe another round like this tomorrow.
Q. Conditions were tougher yesterday, which I suppose added to the fatigue.  It was quite nice playing out there today.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: It was nice and cool and not much wind.  Obviously the rain came and went, but I don't think the conditions were that hard yesterday, either.  Just with the golf course playing soft, you could recover even if you missed the fairway because the ball was stopping on the green.
Can't really give that as an excuse.  I feel like I gave away what could have been a better round yesterday but I can't dwell on that now.  Just looking forward to a good round tomorrow.
Q. What will you do now?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Nothing.  Just go back and rest.  It's been five weeks now on the trot, and I've got a very good friend of mine that's come over from India, so just spend some time with him and relax.
