 Q.  Your best finish so far on the PGA TOUR.  What's going through your mind right now?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Disappointment obviously.  It was obviously a harder start.  I got unlucky with the tee shot and just compounded my errors.  My short game again, coming up a little bit to bite me.   
But obviously I tried my best.  I fought back as best I could, but I just couldn't get the putts to fall on the back nine.  I had numerous lipouts and then just really disappointed that I didn't birdie 17 or 18 or even 16, for that matter.  Just didn't get the numbers right with my wedges.  I didn't hit them close.  It's very disappointing.   
I would have obviously liked to have gotten over the line, but it's a tough pill to swallow.   
 Q.  What was different today compared to the last few days?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I didn't make a nine, that was the first thing.   
I seemed to get some momentum going on the front nine but then I made a bogey immediately after I made an eagle on 5 and that killed it.  It didn't come in bunches.  You need to make birdies here in bunches.  You need to roll two, three in a row.   
I had a lot of good looks, but I just didn't manage to hole as many as I needed to.  I think I hit a lot of good putts but it wasn't meant to be.  So super disappointed.   
 Q.  What are some of the positives that you can take from this week?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Lots of positives.  Obviously I've made a lot of birdies over these last five rounds that I've played.  I'm in a good place.  I'm off to a decent start, good start I would say, on the PGA TOUR.   
But again, just missed out on a large number of FedExCup points, World Ranking points, just down the stretch interest in the end.  So feeling a bit disappointed with that, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you feel confident going into another big week next week in Shanghai?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I'm not in next week.  Whenever I tee it up next, likely to be in Turkey, hopefully I can put myself in this situation again.  The only thing I can look at, if I keep putting myself in contention, I'm bound to convert one sooner rather than later.   
 Q.  Does this give you confidence that you will get over the line on the PGA TOUR sooner rather than later?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I have the confidence.  It's not like I need additional confidence.  But I need validation now.  I need validation in terms of my game.  I need to see that happen.  It's just not happened enough, and it's been a year of near misses so far.   
I mean, it's a good problem to have I guess, but it's something that I want to change obviously the rest of this season on the PGA TOUR.  Not the way I would like to play on a Sunday, not at all.  It's hard.   
 Q.  How was the feeling like when you left the practice range this morning?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I was feeling good.  I just wanted to stick to my plan and just keep finding greens, keep giving myself good looks.  But I didn't hit it very close and I've been putting a little bit better than I did today.  I missed a short one on 5 and missed a couple others that I could have holed.  Lipped out three of the first four on the back nine, and 10,11 and 13.   
They kill your momentum.  If those putts go in, suddenly I've got two in a row, three in a row, whatever, three in four holes, and that's how you build your score.  That's how you make a charge.  But just didn't happen today.  I tried my best.  But I was just not as sharp as I needed to be coming down the home stretch.   
But I've got no regrets.  Obviously very, very disappointed.   
 Q.  I suppose that shows the level of the PGA TOUR.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I know what it is.  I've been there all year.  You can't have an off-day, really.  You can have an off-hole and make a bogey or a double even and get away with it, but you can't make nines on a Sunday and expect to win a tournament.  It's hard.   
I still believed I could come back from that and I tried my best, but to come back from that, you need to do something special.  You need to make those 20-, 25-footers and you need to convert your half-chances and it just didn't happen for me.   
 Q.  What are your other stops apart from Turkey?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Probably play two more on the PGA TOUR before the end of the year, MÃ©xico and Sea Island.
