Q. Talk about two solid rounds to move into a nice position.  Here?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I'm feeling good.  I think I'm playing some of my best golf in terms of how I'm hitting it.  Obviously not been a good scoring two days.  Could easily have been in -- should have been in double digits, but you know, if I can keep hitting it like this on the weekend and give myself some chances, I'll be pretty happy.
Q. And yet, there's a lot of solace with your position on the board because you're nicely placed.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm in a good spot.  Like I said, I've been playing well and I feel like I'm in form.  Just need to get in a bit of putting form in the weekend and see if I can get in the mix on Sunday.
Q. With what you've achieved this season, are your expectations even greater?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Not really.  I mean, I expect myself to go out there and do my best.  Obviously I've worked on my game to get it to a place where I feel like I can contend with the best fields in the world.  So hopefully the proof will be in the taste of the pudding, so we'll find out.
Q. Are you relishing Hong Kong?  Do you like playing here at Fanling?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Absolutely.  I love playing narrow, tight courses and Fanling is about as tight as you'll get.  It's great when you have to think and navigate, and I really enjoy that.
Q. You mentioned about playing with top players; what's it like having Ian Poulter here with all his backstory for this week, the last-minute arrival?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I think he's played quite well; for someone who has just gotten in on Thursday or Wednesday night or Thursday morning, he's playing quite well.  He's obviously very much at home on this golf course.  He's putting great.  So you know, it will be nice to get into the mix.  He'll probably be in there, as well.
