ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think we both hit it really well but we just didn't make any putts.  I think I missed a short one on 6.  That was a gift.  And I think we kind of lost the momentum.  It was a very tight match, but I think on the back nine, they just made more putts than us.  I think Wang played pretty good, as well.
Q. Tell us your experience, the first time playing here.
JEUNGHUN WANG: It was exciting but I putted really bad today.  I feel sorry to Anirban.
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think we both got out-putted today.  I don't think we played badly but that's what both of us have to go back and work on.  It's going to be important to make more 10-, 15-footers the next two days.
JEUNGHUN WANG: It's not finished yet.  I'll try my best tomorrow.
Q. Did you have to impart any experience?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Not really.  He knows what to do.  He's a good player.  I have a lot of confidence in him.  Every time I've played with him, I've been very impressed.  Today was not any different.  I think he still played good golf.  But, you know, when you have to win holes, you have to make birdies.  Both of us, we only made three birdies today.
On a course like this, three birdies is not going to win matches.  You have to make six, seven birdies, and you know, we'll be doing that the next two days.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I'm so happy to play with Anirban.  He's a really good player.
