Q.   You're still alive, just a couple of comments about the round?
    ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Yeah, I think it was‑‑ I played really good.   It was a really solid round.   I don't think Ryan played poorly, either.   I think it was a really good match.   I think just around the turn, I kind of got the advantage with 9 and 10.   And then it was massive for me to birdie 13, and then chip in on 14 to keep myself three ahead.
    Pretty happy.   I didn't make a bogey today.   That's a pretty good sign for me and putting better, feeling good. 

Q.   How is your mentality in terms of match play versus stroke play?   Just some comments on how your game sets up for match play?
    ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   I think I do pretty well in match play.   I was just talking to my caddie about it and there's no letting up.   You have to kind of be in the zone right through.   And you can't have a plateau in your focus, you've got to be really intense.   And I think I like playing golf that way.   So hopefully I can keep that up.
