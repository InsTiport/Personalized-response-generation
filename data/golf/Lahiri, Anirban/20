 Q.  A great round, except the two bogeys at the end.  How do you feel?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I feel quite disappointed actually.  You know, that front nine, I could have done a lot more and to finish the week like that is obviously a bitter taste in my mouth.  But still a decent start.  I would have liked to definitely be a couple shots better, if not three.  But it's one of those courses where you have to just keep making birdies and keep going low.  We saw what happened last year.  Good start.   
 Q.  To have a streak like that on your front nine must make you feel quite confident.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm definitely in a good place mentally.  It just depends on how long I can sustain it.  I had it going pretty much all day and just a couple of loose shots in the end that cost me but it could easily have been a couple of shots better.  I have to just try and sustain that over the next 54 holes to give myself a good shot on Sunday.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're riding the momentum from last week?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I definitely felt like that when I started out, but this is a different tournament.  This is a fresh start and all the scores are level when you tee it up on Thursday morning.   
You know, I've just got to take it one round at a time, whatever happens behind me, but obviously there's a good, solid amount of confidence coming into this week and I just need to play with that for the rest of the event.   
 Q.  What was the highlight of the year for you?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Well, I'd like a highlight to come.  It hasn't been a great year for me.  I haven't won this year.  A couple of disappointing seconds at the Indian Open and then last week.  You know, I'm hoping that I can finish on a high.
