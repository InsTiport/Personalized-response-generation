Q. Final thoughts for this week in Hong Kong?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think I played pretty solid.  Obviously disappointing back nine today.  Just felt like I ran out of gas today and I just didn't have much energy left in the tank.
I think it's going to be a lot of rest before I tee it up next week on Thursday, but I'm playing well.  Obviously I've got to manage my energy levels a little better now going to the next few weeks.
Q. And more importantly, you're extending your lead on the Asian Tour; something that's one of your goals?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Yeah, I'm obviously disappointed with how I finished, because there were a lot of World Ranking point the this week, and this gave a few away.  But having said that, I'm pretty happy.  If I can play poorly on a Sunday back nine and still finish in seventh position, then I'm obviously doing something right.
So I'm happy with how I'm playing.  Obviously next week is critical.  That's probably the week that's going to decide to a large extent how the rest of the Order of Merit chase runs out and hopefully I can play well next week.
