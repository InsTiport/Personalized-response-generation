Q. Your thoughts on the pairings tomorrow?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I'm really looking forward to it.  I think it's an honor to be going out first for the Asian Team.  I think it's going to be a lot of fun.  I'm playing with Wang.  I really think he's a big talent and he's probably at a similar stage to where I was two years back.  I'm just going to try to help him just play freely.  Really looking forward to it.  I think it's going to be a good match starting up and I'm going to try to get our team off to a good start.
Q. Really important to get the first point?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: Absolutely.  I think it's going to be critical that we get off to a good start, and just go out there and be aggressive.  Tomorrow is fourball, so we can both play our natural game, which is to make a lot of birdies.
This week, we are all one team and the camaraderie is fantastic.  You can hear it in the background.  Going into Friday, this is what we need.  We are all relaxed and we are all focused.
