  THE MODERATOR:   We have with us Anirban Lahiri.   He finished second at the Venetian Macau Open on Sunday after shooting a course record 62 on the last day.   Welcome back to the KLGCC and Golf Course here.   You just finished 18 holes of practice.   Just give us your assessment of the course and whether it's any different from what you guys have played on? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Hi, everyone.   Yeah, I mean, it's nice to be back to start, obviously on the Asian Tour we play here every year.   We're quite familiar with the conditions.   Quite similar in most ways, but I think the golf course is in brilliant shape.   I probably have not played it in better shape any time before.   The greens are probably a little bit firmer and faster than I have ever played them.   So it's going to be a good test.

Q.   Coming into the week, some really good performers are looking forward to playing with some of the players on the PGA TOUR? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Yeah, it's always good to come into a big event with some confidence behind you.   I mean, when you play a couple of good tournaments and good rounds, low rounds when you get into a big event whether it's the CIMB or the events that are going to follow this.   You know, it helps you to believe in yourself and do even better.

Q.   It's your first time at the CIMB Classic.   It's an event on the Asian Tour and on the PGA TOUR.   How much of an impact does it make for you guys out there? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   I think what it basically does, in essence, is it (Indiscernible) itself from the Asian Tour.   Any of us could have Order of Merit this week.   Whoever win this is week, if somebody was to go ahead and win this event, in the Order of Merit, they practically get a three‑year exemption, because this is the second official tournament on the PGA TOUR calendar. 
So it's a huge difference from last year and the years past.   The presence of the event has obviously gone up, the importance has gone up.   I think it's also reflected by the kind of field that's here this week.   We've had some very good players, some marquis players, but a lot of players this week are top 50 in the world because everybody wants to play and get a win early in the year and seal up their cards and get their FedExCup points going up. 
It's a very important event for everyone who is here this week.   Not just the Asian top players.

Q.   How important is this? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Personally, it's obviously a great opportunity for all of us.   The way I look at it is you get a good performance in right now, and can you open up a lot of doors.   You can open up like America, for instance, if you play well enough, maybe get some kind of status, some conditional status if anything else, even if you don't win.   Even otherwise it's a very important week if you want to make an impact on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 
There are a lot of bonuses there if you win Order of Merit or finish top three.   So all of us here are trying to make a big impact this week.

Q.   A chance to play in the Masters as well.   That's quite a nice thing?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Yeah, I didn't know that.   But when you are playing out there, and you're on the 18th hole and you've got a putt to win, you're not thinking, oh, I get into the Masters.   But, obviously, like I said, you do well in big events and it opens up doors.   Whether it's the PGA TOUR or the European Tour.   You always want to play your best golf.   Your A‑game when you come into an event like this.

Q.   If you had a choice, who would you like to be paired with? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Well, that's a difficult question to answer now because I already know who I'm playing with.   The draw is out.   But I've played with some of the players who are playing this week.   I've played with Ernie earlier in the year, and he's a great guy to play with.
