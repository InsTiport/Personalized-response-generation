 Q.  Just talk about pulling out the halve there in front of all your teammates.  What was that like for you?  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I was disappointed that I couldn't get the full point.  I played really badly in the middle part of the round.  Made a lot of bogeys, unforced errors, bad clubs.  But I looked at the board, and the way the team fought back today is magnificent.   
I remember in the morning when we went out, Tony Johnstone told me the worst the team has ever lost in a Presidents Cup was 10 1/2 points.  I looked up and I saw 10 1/2, so I wanted to get that.   
 Q.  You started off pretty well.  
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: No, I really lost my concentration in the middle there.  Made some quick swings, in bad selections in terms of what clubs to hit.  9, I should have gone one club more.  10, I should have gone one club less.  Didn't really make bad swings, but a couple of bad decisions.  That was completely on me.   
Then made a few bad swings after that, lost my concentration, but then I just tried to fight as hard as I can.
