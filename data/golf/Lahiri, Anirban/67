  CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Welcome to the press conference, well done guys.   Thongchai, some great scenes, tell us what is the feeling to share this first EurAsia Cup presented by DRB‑HICOM.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   First, like to say thank you to our team, did a good job today.   Really proud of you guys.   You played fantastic today.   I'm very proud of you guys and hope that in the future we can‑‑ I'm not complaining at all.   I'm very happy, I'm very, very happy and very proud of you guys and I'm so happy to be sharing the trophy and to get ten points and very happy to get a good come back, I'm very, very happy.   That's the best thing I say here. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   At what point during the final day here did you feel that Asia had a chance to share or win the EurAsia Cup? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think in our meeting with them together, who is going to play first, who is going to play last, thinking about‑‑ I know the guys playing awesome but you never know in this format who is going to play and if we put the right players to get in. 
Luckily we got seven points today and very, very good come back today, we have seven points.   I'm thinking about, try to push up and everything try and attack and also you have to be positive.   Every player, they has what they want to do, they do a good job.   Thank you very much. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Tanihara-san, how were you feeling heading down the 18th hole? 
HIDETO TANIHARA:   I knew that on 14 that it depended on our group and it would decide everything.   On 16, 17, had great putts, but the opponent played better.   It was really exciting the whole way for me. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Do you think you could make a putt on 18? 
HIDETO TANIHARA:   Thongchai said it was going to break and it broke more than he thought but it was fun. 

Q.   Nicholas, can you give us your thoughts on the final hole against Miguel? 
NICHOLAS  FUNG:   Expecting to putt on the last hole because it's quite far and somewhat outside the ridge there.   My first putt, I could almost put it back (laughter) and so if you putt this one, maybe your team has a chance to win.   But luckily our Team Asia fight back and it was a very good come back on the last few holes, yeah. 

Q.   How satisfying was itto sit down here as the joint champions of the first EurAsia Cup?
GAGANJEET BHULLAR: Trust me, ever since I landed in Kuala Lumpur national airport, I was so pumped up and so full of confidence.   The first two days we played very well and yesterday me and Nicholas played well but we made a few mistakes on the last few holes. 
Today from tee No. 1, I was just so positive.   I was ready to take on anybody, and I guess that's what we guys needed today, and all the points, the seven points, they were very important.   

Q.   What you did today, and what happened at Ryder Cup last year, or two years ago, in America in Chicago, this come back is unparalleled and unexpected, amazing and one of the headlines; how did the team get pumped up like you did, the team confidence, that went way up.   The confidence must have gone up last night.   I'd like to hear what happened. 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: For us, we had everything to gain.   All the boys, everybody in the team, really wanted to come hard and prove a point.   A lot of the people wrote us off.   I was reading a lot in the media on Twitter and Facebook and there was a lot of backlash. 
I think all of us found that strength deep within us to come back and show them that, you know, we aregolfers, as well.   Everybody puts European golf up there, and I think it's time that Asian golf gets the credit we should get. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   What does this result mean for Asian golf and the Asian Tour to come back from 5‑0 down and to share the EurAsia Cup?   What does it mean? 
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   I think it's a great achievement that we drew this match.   But we really had a good come back, very nice day.   First day, we made a five‑down but I think we had a very good players meeting and I'd like to thanks our captain that every morning and afternoon after the game, we had a really good meeting. 
He had spoke to us yesterday afternoon, and especially‑‑ yesterday, he said, we need to talk with you‑‑ I think that things all together, like our players meeting and like taking with us, it's all together, it's helped a lot. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   What did he say to you guys‑‑
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Like when Europe won the U.S. Ryder Cup the last time, we have got nothing to lose.   It's true.   Even the first day we lost all matches‑‑ so, yeah, nothing to lose, because the Europeans won The Ryder Cup, so we have got nothing to lose.   We are getting more experience from that.   So just go for it. 
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Can you answer the same question, please? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   After the first day, finishing 5‑nil behind, I wasn't expecting that we are going to come back to share the trophy but just a little bit too far behind.   After the second round, TJ waiting so hard to change the draw and he worked hard for the team to make the points back.   And then it was a great job for the other team to fight today.   We won the first couple points.   So to share the trophy for a draw is a good result and I m just happy. 

Q.   Do you think that the competition in Asia amongst players will go up as a result of today?   Is it your objective as individuals to go and play and get that extra‑‑ do you think that we can do it without help from outside? 
ANIRBAN LAHIRI: I think as someone who I think I'm on the cusp of breaking into‑‑ I think, yes, to play with a better field and by a better field, I mean higher World Ranking points and I mean bigger prize money and I mean bigger‑profile events.   At the moment, I think in America and other places to be playing‑‑ you get some really quality fields like you got this week from Europe. 
Yes, I do think most players do aspire to play in America and in Europe, and as you can see, we are not doing too badly here in Asia, either, as we showed this week. 

Q.   Whenever you have the players meeting, what do you tell them?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think only thing is yesterday, the first thing I think is win or lose, doesn't matter.   Most important is win, but the most important‑‑ you never know you can catch up or not.   I tell them, okay, positive and also play your own game and enjoy your game and play the course and play how you like, that's the most important.   Everyone do a very good job today.   Everyone I say enjoy your game and positive.   That's the main, the key point.
