Q.   Had to fight back on the back, didn't you?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   Yeah, it was quite a horrendous start by me today.   Very disappointed, actually, to get into that situation to start, but I think I fought back well. 
You know, I'm going to have to really play my best golf the next two days if I want to make an impact on this tournament.   But I don't think I'm too far away.   I think the last 15 odd holes or 12 holes that I played were pretty solid.   I could have actually made a few more birdies.
Just need to find that rhythm for the next 36 and not have any loose holes. 

Q.   What happened at the start of the today?   Was it a matter of pushing, trying too hard or pushing too hard?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   No, not really.   I just made a bad clubbing decision on 11, and on 12 I got unlucky yesterday, got a little unlucky today, but just hit the shots bad enough to get into a bad spot, and then I just never made my sixâ€‘footers for par or bogey.   So that has been an issue this week, so hopefully I get my speeds right over the next two days.

Q.   No cut in the event, so you'll be in the weekend round.   How will you ready yourself up for the last two days?
ANIRBAN LAHIRI:   I've got everything to play for.   I am playing well.   I believe that I'm playing really well, and I need to just put it together for 36 holes.   I've gotta start doing more and thinking less on the course.
