  Q. Good recovery from those early dropped shots?  
 PETER WHITEFORD: Yeah, two dropped shots, but with that said, yesterday, I didn't feel like I was swinging it well and I tried working on it on the range and I didn't feel -- I was a little bit nervous the first couple of holes and when you're not swinging it well and you're nervous, it's not good for the confidence.   
 But I managed to get the eagle and get back to level for the front nine and press on from there. That was a big eagle and I just did the par 5s today really. The first eagle was a lovely drive, 7-iron 20 feet and holed it for eagle. I had a good read off the guy before me so that was good.  
 Then basically knocked it on in two at 9. I basically knocked it on two here and another par 5, knocked it on in two. Apart from that one, they are all 2-putt birdies, as well. The game, it didn't feel great today but I mean, I kept bogeying, and then got them back on the birdie holes. Just doesn't feel quite there but delighted to be where I am considering. Normally I'd be 23 over at this stage, missed the cut a year over. Delighted, really.   
  
  Q. A sign of progress, isn't it? You can take confidence from in that in itself.   
 PETER WHITEFORD: I'd love to be saying this two years ago but normally I would say iron play is my strength of the game. I've never been the best driver of the ball. It's just not happening. I don't know, the flags were on the left today, as well, I thought, the majority. I think that's why yesterday it felt easy because they were all a wee bit on the right. It was a wee bit trickier for the eye for me today to score. But delighted with the way I scored.
