 Q.   Peter, 11, pleased with that?   
PETER WHITEFORD:   It was good.   It was a lovely shot.   If it didn't go in, it was probably going to be pretty stiff anyway.   Great way to start the day and thankfully I carried on from there.   
   
 Q.   I spoke to Andrew Johnston yesterday and he got 168 bottles of champagne.   
PETER WHITEFORD:   I'll have a word; maybe he can give me a couple.   It's an eagle, so it's the total I'm looking for.   
   
 Q.   65, great round of golf?  
PETER WHITEFORD:   Solid day, a couple of mishaps in there but most of it was pretty good.   I had a few chances I missed, as well.   Annoyed on the last to miss that little putt, but apart from that, a great day, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Much different, your game, from yesterday?     
PETER WHITEFORD:   It was certainly easier this morning, not as much breeze and just not as much of a battle.   Yeah probably hit better shots today and gave myself better birdie chances.  
   
 Q.   You're in great shape after two rounds a year ago, are you conscious of that and kicking on this time?  
PETER WHITEFORD:   Last year was last year.   Obviously didn't finish it off but it's experience.   Every time you get up there, it's always experience.   Hopefully I can carry on tomorrow and have a good four rounds instead of just two.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you're not where you were last season.   What's the difference?  
PETER WHITEFORD:   The driver mainly.   I've barely been on the fairway for six months.   I put an old one in the bag that I found in the closet with dust all over it.   That's helped a lot.   I used that for years.   It's just getting the ball in play off the tee, and my irons are finally coming back.   The game seems to be coming together; it's just if I can keep it going.   
   
 Q.   Feeling good going into the weekend?   
PETER WHITEFORD:   Better.   I never feel great, but better, certainly.   Better's great at the moment.
