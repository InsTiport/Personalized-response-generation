  Q. Good finish?   
 PETER WHITEFORD: My swings at the end were a bit more solid and look forward to tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Have you got a new club in the bag this week, a new driver, is that right?  
 PETER WHITEFORD: I do. The last one was wearing a bit thin. The shaft was feeling like it was going to break any minute. First thing I changed -- yeah, it's going okay, yeah, driver's fine. Game's in decent shape, not brilliant yet but hopefully it will get better soon.   
  
  Q. Because as you say, everything has been pretty good, really, hasn't it the last couple of months, so there wasn't a need to change too much?  
 PETER WHITEFORD: Exactly the game is in good shape. Last week was -- I played shocking last week, a week off didn't do the trick, did it. Hopefully we can get some sharpness back. And as I say, the short game was great today, so 3-under was a good score.  
  
  Q. This is a big event itself but of course The Scottish Open coming up itself, and a lot at stake over the next few weeks.   
 PETER WHITEFORD: Obviously this is a big event this one here, but Scotland for me is one of the biggest ones of the year and I have the British Open after that, so it's a lovely sort of -- it will be nice for the form to keep getting better and press on, yeah.
