KIM BROZER:  A tournament in, firstly this area, Ontario is just awesome.  I played here in '93, and it's the typical layout and the support is fantastic.
Q.  You talk about the pressure.  Is it pretty tough on a day like today?  She comes in, she's close to the front, but
KIM BROZER:  It's tough.  She has had    you know, she has opportunities.  It's still early and she's playing very well, and every move is watched as all the top players are, and it's tough, let me tell you.  She's doing a great job.
Q.  I know in your LPGA career you haven't had sort of a lot of top finishes.  What's sort of clicking for you this week?
KIM BROZER:  Isn't that a good question.  If I knew that, I'd bottle that.

I saw my teacher two weeks ago because I've been struggling a little bit, and I have to tell you in the last couple years I worked recently    my swing teacher is in Pennsylvania, his name is Ted Sheftic.  A big, big help to me in the last two years, I've been working with Pia Nilsson and Lynn Marriott out in Phoenix, I mean, and it's just a matter of using what they helped me learn about myself.
