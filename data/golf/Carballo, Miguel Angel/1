 Q.  What was it like to witness history today?  
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: Very impressive, and so glad to be able to be here and watch this player do this.  Like everybody really likes to be here at this moment.   
 Q.  What was it like to witness history, though?  At what point did you realize something truly special was taking place?  
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: He made an eagle on No. 3, and after that eagle we talked about that he could make everything, because he was in the zone.  We thought he could make everything, but not as many as he finally did.   
 Q.  You were playing in the final round of the Travelers Championship; however, was your heart beating a little bit faster?  Was there ever a sense on your part that you just wanted to stay out of the way?  
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: The crowd was so loud, and at the 18th we decide today go first because we knew how it was going to be.  Yeah, but we were like witnesses.  We were part of the crowd cheering for him.   
 Q.  It has never happened before in the history of the PGA TOUR, and you were here to witness it.  How much did you enjoy your front-row seat?  
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: We talked about that.  We were seeing the best golf round in the history of golf, and actually we talked about that since hole No. 9 when he finished.  He made a birdie for 8-under, and we said, if he makes three or four more under, he's going to be the best round in history.
