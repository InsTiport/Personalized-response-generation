   GRAEME STORM: I just played lovely and got off to a great start. I was playing a big name in world golf in Thomas Bj√∂rn so it was important to get off to a good start and make a couple of birdies. I did that and never really looked back. Obviously he wasn't well yesterday and might not have been 100 per cent but I put that out of my mind and managed to shoot five under without a bogey. Good golf all round.
