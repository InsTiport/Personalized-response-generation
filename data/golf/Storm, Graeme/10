 Q.   A lovely day's golf, isn't it?  
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, it was, yeah.   Played fantastic.   Drove the ball great.   Only missed a few fairways and then it was a nice way to finish making par at the last and keeping the bogeys off the card.  
   
 Q.   Conditions?   
GRAEME STORM:   Conditions are perfect.   The golf course is in great condition.   It's testing but it's fair.   The greens are great.   I mean, the weather is fantastic.   I think we brought the weather from Ireland.   
   
 Q.   Must be a joy to see your name up there, because it hasn't happened for a little while.   
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, it's always the same every year.   It's been a bit of a bad season so far, so that's just nice to see my name on the leaderboard, as it was in the U.S. Open, even for a brief time.   I missed the cut but I had an enjoyable experience.   
   
 Q.   Inspirational playing at that top level, playing well; it refreshes you presumably to know that you can play this game and you're a talented player.   
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, without a doubt.   Pinehurst was such a tough test of golf.   
Martin Kaymer played exceptional and made it look easy, but to play against those guys and kind of perform for most of the week and play nicely, and to take the form into Ireland and hopefully continue to play well.   
   
 Q.   Is there any reason why it's been a tricky old year?   
GRAEME STORM:   It's been a tough year off the course to be perfectly honest with you.   But it's one of those things that I have to try and deal with and move on and hopefully the golf will pick up.
