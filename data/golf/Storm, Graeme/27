   GRAEME STORM:  I feel horrific to be honest (with an upset stomach). It was so hot out there and I didn't sleep last night so I think I have just done that on adrenaline. I didn't think I was going to play but I got some stuff off the physios and that seemed to help a little. 

 Q.  Any idea what it is? 
 GRAEME STORM:  Could be anything. I don't know if it is food or a bug going around. It has been the hottest out of the three days so not a good day to be ill. But I got it round and didn't hole many putts so I feel a little aggrieved with my score. Could have been a little better. But I am over the moon to keep myself in the ball game. I thought if I could go out and keep myself amongst the leaders I would have a chance tomorrow. Who knows what might happen tomorrow. 

 Q.  Is it a case of holding it together? 
 GRAEME STORM:  Sometimes being ill can help your golf as you have to concentrate so hard and not let it get you down too much. Now I am straight to bed and that is it. Hopefully I can get some fluids down my neck and I will feel better tomorrow. 
 This is the closest I have come to pulling out and if I had been out of the top 20 I would be going home. I won once when I was feeling like this on the Challenge Tour in Morocco so I am hoping it will be a good omen for me.
