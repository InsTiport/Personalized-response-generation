 Q.  Pleased with that?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, it was great.  A little bit disappointing from, I think it was 12, where I missed quite a short one and went on to miss another short one and another one.  It was kind of about just keeping my composure towards the end of the round and giving myself a couple chances, which is what I did.   
 Q.  Great up-and-down on the last, must be great momentum into tomorrow.  
GRAEME STORM: I'm not so sure it was a great up-and-down.  It was a terrible bunker shot to be honest with you.  But to hole a putt like that and in front of all the support I've got here, it gives me momentum going into tomorrow.   
There's lots of people out there that I know.  There's lots of people I don't know.  Seem to have got the name "Stormsy" now.  I thought it was a singer, but there you go.  That's what they seem to be calling me out there, but I don't mind.   
 Q.  What's the game plan going into tomorrow?  
GRAEME STORM: Just more of the same.  Fairways and greens for me.  I can't blow it over bunkers out there, so I've just got to put it in position and keep the strategy the same and hole a few more putts.
