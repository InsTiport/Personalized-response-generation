Q.   Yesterday 4‑over par through seven and back to 1‑over, how much was that a contributing factor to today? 
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, it was massive.   The whole thing was just to get it on the greens, I feel as though I'm going to hole every putt.   It was just getting on the greens and I managed to do that close in the round yesterday and made a few birdies. 

Q.   Four birdies in the middle of the round today, so putting was the key to that, was it?
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, chipping and putting is pretty fantastic, so hopefully I'll continue over the weekend but the rest of my game needs to be sharpened up.

Q.   What's behind the confidence with the putter?
GRAEME STORM:   I just picked it up in Ireland and the guy said to me, it's been special made for JosÃ© Maria OlazÃ¡bal but he doesn't want it.   And I picked it up and since then I've played great with it.

Q.   Your best performance of the year at The French Open and a couple of missed cuts since, so what's been going on in the game?
GRAEME STORM:   I didn't play great in Scotland, both times I played with five weeks off, didn't really help me.   Spent a lot of time with the practise and didn't put in as much time as I should have done and I was a little rusty, hence why I'm struggling with the long game this weekend.

Q.   Do you have a good feeling with this putter as hot as it is?
GRAEME STORM:   Who knows.   Like I said, if I can get it on the fairway and get it on the greens, you never know, but I just want to play better to be honest.
