 Q.  Thoughts on the week?  
GRAEME STORM: I'm a little bit disappointed to be perfectly honest.  I felt as though I left quite a few shots out there and missed a few putts and what have you.  In general, I've had a great week.  Four scores again in the 60s, and I think a hat trick of 67 the last three days.  I'm pleased with the scoring.  I just feel as though I've let myself down on the greens, missing a few putts when they were crucial, you know.   
 Q.  A lot of positives coming out of this week?  
GRAEME STORM: Without a doubt, yeah.  I finished third last week and fourth this week.  Playing really nicely, and next week, the Dunhill, is my favourite week of the year, so I'm really looking forward to it.   
 Q.  The week as a whole with the crowds, great week, isn't it?  
GRAEME STORM: It's been magnificent.  The weather hasn't been that great.  We had the odd bit of sunshine and the fans have come out and supported.  I've had a lot of people supporting me, which has been fantastic, and something I'll remember for a long time.
