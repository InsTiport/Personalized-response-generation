  GRAEME STORM:   Pretty much the same as yesterday.   Didn't play as good as I'd like, but managed to hit a few more greens.   Didn't drive the ball great coming in, either.   So a little bit disappointed with my finish, but you know, I'm still in there. 

Q.   Rather like yesterday, looks terrific, but at the same time, it's tricky out there. 
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, it is really tricky.   It's hard to keep it on the fairways.   The fairways are quite bouncy and it's hard to get it near the flags because the greens are quite firm, and they were tucked away today.   So it is quite tricky out there.

Q.   Thomas Levet was saying that even some of your good shots are getting punished because it is different to other years; it is so firm. 
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, I suppose they are.   But you want the course to be playing as hard as stone and you want to try and play on those courses as much as you possibly can and do the best you possibly can.   It's a great test and reminds me of France a little bit this week.

Q.   Are you still positive, therefore, because we know how well you played in France, not only this season but in the past, and you're nicely in the mix behind the leader. 
GRAEME STORM:   Yeah, I'm in the mix.   He might have got a little bit too far away from me but if I can just finish in the top 5, that will be a great week for me.
