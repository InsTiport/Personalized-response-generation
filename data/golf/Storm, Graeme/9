GRAEME STORM: It was a nice way to finish.  I played nicely all day.  Made a little bit of a mess up on No. 4 but other than that it was a nice way to finish.   
 Q.  Conditions today, the sun is out right now, ideal out there, isn't it?  
GRAEME STORM: It has been.  It was quite warm yesterday but nice temperature out there.  The breeze is flicking around a little bit, making it a little tricky to select the clubs.   
 Q.  What's given you the most satisfaction to this point?  
GRAEME STORM: That I made the cut; that I'm in contention to do what I need to do.   
 Q.  Game-wise, as well?  
GRAEME STORM: Game's decent, yeah.  I've worked really hard over the last couple of days to get the swing feeling good and what-have-you, so it feels good on the golf course and I'm hitting some good shots.  I've hit a few wayward drives, which I don't normally do but something I can correct over the weekend.   
 Q.  Breathe a little sigh of relief and looking forward over the weekend?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, I need a strong finish over the weekend.  There's no stopping now.  Tone of voice keep going.  Crystal ball can come out and look at and think, oh, well, I need to finish here but just need to keep doing what I'm doing and it will take care of itself.
