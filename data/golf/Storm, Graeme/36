Q.  That putt on 18?
GRAEME STORM:  To be honest I knew I had to hole it to make sneak one in but you never know.  There's a lot of golf left to be played and 16, 17, 18 are very tricky with the wind, so we'll see what happens.
Q.  Would you rather be at 6 under in the clubhouse or 7 under standing on the 17th tee?
GRAEME STORM:  I think 6 under in the clubhouse.

I'm disappointed, yeah, I was grinding it out and I did hit a poor shot at 17.  But I still had the chance to make par from where I was.  I thought, well, I've left myself an easy pitch.  I didn't quite hit the pitch out.  I saw the chance and I hit it, unfortunately the wind blew and held it up right in the middle in the jaws.

And then 18, hit a great 9 iron to eight, nine feet, and I thought, left edge, I hit it just inside left, I didn't hit it hard enough and it missed on the left side so disappointed, realistically, so that's why I was more disappointed.  You don't get a chance to win very often.
