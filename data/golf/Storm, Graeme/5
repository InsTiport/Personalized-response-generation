Q. Par threes were good to you today.
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, I holed a long putt on the second, and then hit it really close on 16.  Nearly had another car there, which would have been nice, but they were kind to me.
Q. You missed the cut here last year, so nice to come back this year and know you're here for the weekend?
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, I've obviously got fond memories.  It's been ten years since I won here, and I have had a third place finish before.  But it's one of those golf courses, if you're not on your game, you can struggle.  You've just got to keep grinding it out.
Q. How different is the golf course to when you won ten years ago?
GRAEME STORM: Hugely different.  Obviously visually with all the bushes out there now and the long rough, and also the ground was really firm when I won and it was windy on the Sunday.
You know, the softer conditions make it easier off the tee because the fairways are a little wider.
Q. On this golf course, how difficult is it to keep the consistency going over the four days?
GRAEME STORM: It is difficult.  You've just got to try to keep the momentum going.  If you make a mistake, get on with the next shot.  Don't get down on it.
Q. Tied sixth in the first Rolex event of the year.  Be nice to do similar or better?
GRAEME STORM: Hopefully, yeah.  In the mix for the weekend where I want to be.  I'm playing nice.  Just got to keep the momentum going.
