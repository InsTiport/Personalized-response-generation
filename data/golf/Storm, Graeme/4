 Q.  That was an interesting way to play 18?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, it was a bit dÃ©jÃ  vu, wasn't it.  But I managed to hole the putt this time, which was nice, and to finish a nice week off.   
 Q.  Saw your reaction at the end.  These putts, when you get to the top of the leaderboard are massive in terms of points and money, but it was great coming off the back of the birdie on 17, as well?  
GRAEME STORM: I played 17 aggressively.  I was a little unfortunate it kicked left and didn't go on the green.  I managed to get up-and-down there.   
18, I hit the tee shot and knew straightaway where it was going and I thought, oh, not again.  I managed to scramble a par in the end.   
 Q.  Obviously a 67 on the final day, it's been four great rounds of golf from you this week.  As you mentioned earlier in the week with the injury, that must be very pleasing to get back to some good form at this time of the year?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, absolutely.  To putt four starts in the 60s and to finish near the top of the leaderboard is really rewarding for kind of the setback and the hard work that I've put in away from the golf.   
 Q.  How have you enjoyed the overall experience?  The weather has been great and the crowds have been good, and sunshine for a change.  
GRAEME STORM: It's been absolutely fantastic.  When we come to Portugal, this is the sort of weather that we expect.  The tournament has been really unlucky over the last so many years, so it's nice to see they have had nice weather and it's been a great event.   
 Q.  Just finally, looking ahead to next week, playing on your own doorstep, how much are you looking forward to Close House?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, looking forward to it.  Been looking forward to it all year.  Just roll out of bed and drive up and play golf.  It should be fun.  Hopefully it will be a great week.  I'm sure it will be well supported.
