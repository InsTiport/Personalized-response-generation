Q. How did that feel, 68 this morning?
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, it was great.  It's probably as easy a 68 as you're ever going to shoot to be perfectly honest.  I had a few more chances; should have been a little bit lower.  But quite happy with the start.
Q. Have you ever played this golf course with it as calm as that?
GRAEME STORM: No.  Straight answer to that, no.  It's incredible.  After the three days of practice with the wind, and then to be hardly any breeze, at all, it's just incredible.
Q. Have you settled down now after the win in South Africa?
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, I came down with a bit of a bump last week shooting 77 on Friday, so missing the cut.  Still hasn't quite sunk in, really, to be perfectly honest.  Obviously not been in the winner's circle for so long, and also to beat Rory, was great obviously for me.
Yeah, it will sink in at some point, I'm sure.
Q. What are your immediate short-term goals?
GRAEME STORM: Just keep playing well hopefully.
Q. You played well today.  If you can keep that going, anything's still possible.
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, just try to take each week as they come.  Just try to enjoy my golf, no goals, no targets.  Just go each week and just play well.
