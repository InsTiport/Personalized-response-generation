 Q. How aggressive could you be out there with your golf?
 GRAEME STORM: Yeah, you can be aggressive. Obviously the greens are very receptive so if you hit it in the fairways you've plenty of birdie chances. Yeah, I played great out there today.

 Q. Certainly enjoyed the roll of the greens?
 GRAEME STORM: Yeah, I had a couple 3-putts, 12 and 14, which was disappointing to be honest. But apart from that, holed pretty much everything.

 Q. Tell us about your new caddie. 
 GRAEME STORM: First week on the bag, me and Darren together. We are going to do four weeks and see how we go from there. Obviously it's great to get off to a flying start.

 Q. The relationship is going in the right direction at the moment?
 GRAEME STORM: Without a doubt. Certainly different for me. I've only had two caddies since I came back out here and both of them have been very, very good, but obviously just needed to freshen things up and fancied a change, and Darren was available.

 Q. How comfortable are you feeling with your game at the moment?
 GRAEME STORM: Yeah, it's coming together. I had a nice couple of weeks off which was good. Didn't really do a lot, just chilled out. 
 Yeah, that was good. So hopefully it will go into tomorrow and be fine.
