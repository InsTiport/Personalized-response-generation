   GRAEME STORM:  It was a great start today. Played nicely on the front nine and made a couple of great up and downs and holed my second shot at the tenth which got me to six under. Just played nicely from then on apart from 16, plugged in a fairway trap and didn't have a shot. Just had to chip it out.   
The eagle was a great shot.  I hit a drive and left myself a perfect yardage of 97 yards, which is a full log wedge for me and I pitched in past the flag and it spun back into the hole. Nice.   
 First time in Thailand and it's really hot. Didn't expect it. I thought Malaysia was the hottest place I'd been to but this beats it. I didn't keep count on the bottles of water I had to drink.   
 I've been on the leaderboard five times in the past six events at some stage. I had four top 20s which is consistent without getting close on the last day. I've played nicely, had a two week break and worked on my swing. It looks the best it's ever looked. I got a bit confused in Dubai and missed the cut but since then I went back to did some work and finished 11th in Malaysia. Back to basics.great I am in the Open, and I will stay on after that.
