GRAEME STORM:  I am in the top five, which is good, but I am slightly disappointed with my finish. I finished 5-5-5 and had chances at 16 and missed the green at the 17th with a wedge and at the 18th with a seven iron. I hit a great pitch to four feet and missed so it was a shade disappointing.

I was hoping to get into the clubhouse at three or four under and try and put some pressure on Thomas. It wasn't really in my thoughts what he was doing. A top five finish would be great for me and for my season. It's been good so far. At the beginning of the season I played well and I've almost got my card. I think something like the top 30 will help me keep my card so that's obviously important to me for the rest of the season.

It was very difficult out there, even the putting, never mind the long shots. The wind could move the ball around and you had to concentrate over every shot.
