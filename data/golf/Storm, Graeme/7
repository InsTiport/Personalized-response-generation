 Q.  Graeme, your thoughts on the changes?  
GRAEME STORM: Since the first changes, I started to play better on this course, because I felt as though it was tougher, which makes you think well -- they have softened it up a little bit.  The greens are fantastic.  Done a great job and every credit to Wentworth.   
 Q.  Yours is a great story this season, may not have even been on the Tour but a win and tied fourth this year.  You've made good ground this year?  
GRAEME STORM: Yeah, it's been a bit of a roller coaster to say the least after the end of last year, what happened, and to win so early in the season was great.  Took the pressure off.  BMW events, it's fantastic to play for them and winning one in South Africa was great for me.  So no pressure and just enjoying the golf.   
 Q.  And first in the new Rolex Series, as well, so exciting times.  Are you looking forward to the rest of the series?  
GRAEME STORM: It's going to be great, isn't it.  It's great they are supporting the Tour the way they are and to put the money into all of these events and what-have-you, the Rolex Series hopefully will grow stronger and stronger.
