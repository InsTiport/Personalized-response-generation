 Q.  18th hole seems a bit odd the way it's designed, especially if you're short of those bunkers, you don't really get a look at the whole hole?  
PATRICK REED: Well, they moved the tee box up today, so I was way past those bunkers.  I had 188 to the front.  You can't putt the ball poorly all day and expect to play well.   
I was able to kind of salvage it early on in the round and through the middle part of the round.  Didn't matter how far right I aimed.  The ball is going left.  I hit first two poor iron shots with 7-iron in the water left, and then I thought, all right, let's try hitting like 80 per cent, kind of hold 6-iron and see if that's better, and all of a sudden it goes 240 yards over the green in the water.  Next thing you know, I walk off with a 10.   
 Q.  First question is always going to be:  Have you ever recorded a 10 that you're aware of?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  I mean, not the first time and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last in my career.   
 Q.  Do you have any idea -- did you at any point figure out what was wrong with the swing today?  
PATRICK REED: Nope.  The more I tried to hold onto it, the more left it went.  The more I tried to aim right, then it just hooked even more.  So going to get on the phone, talk to my coach, try to figure it out.  Usually when that happens, the driver is haywire and I only missed I think three fairways today and one of them wasn't even with a driver.   
So with that being said, the long game was good.  The putting, when I had a chance, was good.  The problem is, I didn't have very many chances inside of 30, 35 feet.  You know, when you don't have a lot of chances from inside 30, 35 feet, you're going to struggle.   
I was able to kind of get it going and getting the score respectable going into the last.  I did the hard part and I hit a good drive down there in the middle of the fairway.   
 Q.  You got the Honorary Membership yesterday.  Just a thought on that?  
PATRICK REED: It's unbelievable.  You know, to be a part of that elite group of players and to be able to grow the game around the world, as well as for really how I've really dedicated myself as an American coming over and playing on The European Tour, to be recognised and to have that honor is amazing.  I look forward to coming over throughout the rest of my career and keep on fulfilling that and becoming a global player.
