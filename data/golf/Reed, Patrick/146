Q. What a win in the first of the FedExCup Playoffs.  How did you get it done?
PATRICK REED: Really, it was patience all week.  I stuck with my game plan and there in my second round, I kind of steered away from the game plan on a couple of the holes and it bit me.
So going into today, I knew that one shot is not a lot around this golf course to make up.  I just needed to stick to my game plan, be patient, and allow my clubs to do the work and allow all the processes we did around this golf course to do the work.
I got on a roll there throughout the middle of the round, made some good putts, and that was key, because you have to feel comfortable around this place.  I felt like that gave me a lot of comfort coming down the stretch, and I was able to kind of hold on here towards the end.
Q. Take me through the last hole.
PATRICK REED: It was huge making that putt on 17, that 6-, 7-footer for par.  When I made that going into the last, sitting there, I'm like, all right, you have a two-shot lead going down the last, the wind is a little bit into and off the left.  I was sitting here thinking, you're not hitting driver.  Just hit 5-wood down there and you should be perfect because it's the fat part of the fairway.
I guess because of the adrenaline, it went a little farther than I expected.  I saw it land in the bunker, so I'm thinking, all right, it's just in the bunker.  I'll somehow get it on the green two, put par, get out of here.
I walk up there and I see it buried completely underneath the lip.  Kessler looked at me and goes, "Do you just want your 61?"
I told him I don't think I could even get 61 out of it.  Hit a nice little sand wedge, just barely covered to get to the fairway.  From that point forward, it was just an easy 9-iron to the middle of the green, wasn't even looking at the flag and I actually pushed it from where I was and got a little closer to the hole.
You know, it's great.  Any way you win a golf tournament, this is the second I've had a two-shot lead going into the last, and I was able to play really conservative and bogey the last to get the W.
