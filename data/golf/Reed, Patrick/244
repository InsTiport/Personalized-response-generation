 Q.  3 1/2 points on your Ryder Cup debut.  What was that experience like for you?  PATRICK REED: It was amazing, just to be able to play for your country is something else.  To be able to come out and perform the way Jordan and I did in the team matching and then individually to go out and get my point meant a lot to me, especially after yesterday's afternoon only pulling in a half a point. I felt like a lot of that was because of me and on me, so I felt like I had to come out on contribute today.   Q.  What was the play with the crowd like today?  PATRICK REED: It was awesome.  In the beginning they were cheering loud for both sides, which is awesome.  To go in and have Henrick make a long putt for birdie, the crowd absolutely went nuts, which I would expect. Then I made one on top of him and I gave them the hush sign, which I was doing it all in fun to get the guys going and get everyone going. It was awesome after that.  It got the European side really fired up and really roaring and it go the US side really fired and really roaring.  It was one of most fun rounds of golf I've ever played.
