 Q.   Was it hard because of what Adam was shooting?  
PATRICK REED:   No, to see how he was putting and hitting some golf shots out there it was impressive.   It seemed like he was in complete control of his game.   And he was reading his putts really well and hitting his lines.  
I felt like I was playing pretty solid.   It was one of those days that I didn't make many putts, and my driver was kind of all over the place.   I was just grinding.   I was hitting a lot of greens, but not hitting them very close.  
   
 Q.   What was the most impressive shot he hit today?  
PATRICK REED:   Probably the 3‑wood he hit on 4.   He just went and ripped it.   And it hit as straight as he did on that one.   That's hard to do to have a 3‑wood and not get it to float and hit it straight.  
   
 Q.   How were the greens?   
PATRICK REED:   You know, they're very quick.   I got myself in trouble a couple of times where I hit it four or five feet back but you don't want to have to do that all week.   I dialed it back and get used to them being as fast as they are.  
   
 Q.   If it stays like this weather‑wise through Sunday, how fast will the greens be and how important will the putting be?  
PATRICK REED:   They will be very quick.   They'll get firmer and faster.   Putting is always crucial in every event.   Seems like the winner always is almost perfect, if not perfect, from six feet on in.   It seems like Adam, except for the putt on 8, couldn't miss inside of 25 feet.  
   
 Q.   Ten years ago Adam was the 23 year old looking to get inside the top‑20.   When you consider that, how does that make you feel?   He was you ten years ago?  
PATRICK REED:   It makes me feel great.   If I continue doing what I'm doing, keep on working really hard I'll hopefully be where he is at, the position where if he goes out and wins this week, he might become No.1 in the world.  
To watch how he played today was very impressive.   To see him, and also to see Justin Rose, I think he's inside the top five, to watch both of those guys play, and to play as solid as I did.   I still felt like I left some shots out there.   I'm going in the correct direction, it's just going to take some time.
