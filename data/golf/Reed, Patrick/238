Q.   Looked like a good match out, and you kept coming out and battled right hard to the end?
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, any time you go in, and you feel like you're hitting the ball really well, I decided to make some putts today.   He didn't give me any shots.   You would think throughout with the wind, it rained a little bit in the middle there; that we would have made a couple bogeys but it really was a pretty bogey‑free round for both of us. 

Q.   He's won several match‑play tournaments, good experience at match play.   So did you have to tailor your game in any way to adapt to that today?
PATRICK REED:   No, not really.   What I mainly try to do is try to do exactly what I did yesterday.   I hit the ball extremely well and felt like I gave myself a lot of looks.   The difference between yesterday and today is I finally got the putter going and made some putts that I needed to.

Q.   You had a good Ryder Cup, of course.   Did you learn anything match‑play‑wise that you've been able to bring into this week?
PATRICK REED:   Mainly the whole time while I was over there, I just tried to have fun, and while I was out here today and while I was here today, main thing I tried to do was have fun and just play the game.   I feel like I'm doing that pretty well right now and that's also why we were able to squeeze out that match today.

Q.   Your group looks to be one of the tightest; a win essential for you to make it through to the quarterfinals?
PATRICK REED:   For sure, all of us have one win and one loss, and whoever wins each group is going to move on.   Hopefully I continue to play well and hopefully make it through.
