Q. You had a good trio to play with today, Patrick, just some comments on the day.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, you know, all in all it was an okay day, I guess, by all three of us.  But I felt like we all kind of left a lot of shots out there today and just kind of one of those days you go out and you grind it out and try and get as many as you can coming in so you can set yourself up for the weekend.
Q. Who is your favorite person you played with in your group?
PATRICK REED: No comment.
(Laughter.)
Q. How was it after the delay for you?
PATRICK REED: It was good.  I birdied 11, 12, and felt like I was doing all right and then I lipped out a putt on 13 for birdie.  But then to be able to bounce back and go birdie 14 and birdie 15, I felt like I was able to keep that kind of momentum going.  And just one of those days, I hit the ball solid, I had a lot of real good looks for birdie, just really feel like I didn't make anything.
