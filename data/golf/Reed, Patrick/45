Q. Closing 66, what was your plan today given where you were on the leaderboard?
PATRICK REED: Well, biggest thing was just kind of see what the weather was going to be doing, and you know, if the weather stayed kind of how it was early on in the round, if it stayed like that, then I would have thought six, maybe seven would have had a chance.
You know, once the weather cleared at that point, it was try to make as many birdies as possible because you know once the rain stopped, the wind didn't really pick up. Now all of a sudden the ground is a little softer so the golf course is a lot more gettable and you can attack and you have to take advantage of it.
Q. When you got on that birdie run, did you allow yourself to peak at what the leaders were doing?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I always watch leaderboards so I knew where they were all day. Biggest thing for me especially after start was give myself opportunities to have a chance for birdies because early in the round I didn't really give myself many opportunities.
I was playing from the rough, it seemed like and I was missing a lot of greens, so I was having to scramble and kind of keep myself in it from shooting 2-under on the front nine, basically 2-under through the first eight, I was at that point able to click around full swing and get it going where it needed to be.
Q. This brings you to the end of a mini-European swing. How much confidence does this give you?
PATRICK REED: It feels great. Feel like I've been playing some solid golf. Just one or two rounds here or there. I need to get off to faster starts early in the week, just like this past week. There was a round there Thursday or Friday that doesn't get me to where I need to be and after that I have to play catch up on the weekend but the good thing is I'm able to play solid on the weekend and go out and make birdies when I need to.
Q. Thanks for your time. Nice to shoot 66 on a final day Sunday. Thoughts of the round today?
PATRICK REED: It was hot and cold. You know, starting the round, I wasn't hitting the ball very well. I was having to scramble early, and the good thing was my short game was where it needed to be. I was getting up-and-down and making the crucial pars to not fall too far behind.
Once I was able to switch it around and get the full swing where it needed to be on the golf course, I was able to attack and make some birdies there and towards the end.
Q. Scoring is relatively low, so everyone talked about birdies. Is it a sign of just one bogey the last 36 holes?
PATRICK REED: For me, really, I feel like the game is where it needs to be. Of course you always could figure out some things to tighten up here or there but yesterday could have been a really special day just by making more putts. I had a lot of lip outs, a lot of burned edges yesterday and I was hitting it close enough. I just wasn't making anything.
That being said, to see a round today where early on it wasn't quite where I needed it to be but being able to flip that switch and having the short game hold it was something that I feel like is great, especially going into the rest of the year.
Q. You said at the beginning of the week how much you've enjoyed the last couple of weeks in Europe. Nice way result-wise to finish your time over here?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, any time you come out, especially in an event I haven't played before, one of the largest events on the European Tour and to have such a large, world-class field and play the way I did; to really hang in there and have a chance, if not win the golf tournament, to scare the leaderboard at the end, was always nice.
