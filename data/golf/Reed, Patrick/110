 Q.  Just your thoughts on the week.  Obviously you and Jordan had really successful matches.   Talk about playing with him and what that was like?  
PATRICK REED: It was a good week.  Captain put us out, the right people with each other.  Jordan and I, we just mesh so well.  Just seems like when I'm out of a hole, he's able to be in it; and when he's out of the hole, I'm in it.  We ham-and-egg it, basically, perfectly together.  That's what it takes to be a successful team.   
It was just a great week.  Our whole entire team got off to an unbelievable start, and basically Sunday to today, everyone went on cruise control and we were able to clinch it.   
 Q.  Obviously a young team.  You look like you have a lot of Presidents Cups in your future.  Talk about what that dynamic has been like, a good amount of rookies on your team this year.  
PATRICK REED: It's been awesome having the rooks on the team.  That's the thing is our team was just so deep, whether it was old veterans or rookies coming in.  It just seemed like the confidence level even being first time out, it was an all-time high.  None of the guys felt nervous or down.  They were just able to come in and play golf.  I felt like that was key.
