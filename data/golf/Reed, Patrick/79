MICHAEL GIBBONS: Welcome, Masters Champion, to Scotland.  Thoughts and feelings on the week ahead?
PATRICK REED: It feels good.  Been over here for a little bit.  To be able to come out and get used to kind of the golf ball rolling as much as it does and how firm it is, it's more of a comfort level, I feel like, for us now.
You have to get used to landing the ball so short.  When you have such a -- 180 yards, it's okay to hit 9-iron because it will bounce and roll, unlike back home where you're hitting, you know, 7-iron.  You just have to kind of get used to not having to overswing to get a certain number out of it.
I feel like I've adapted pretty well, and the golf course here is really pure.  It's in great shape.  I'm looking forward to the week starting.
MICHAEL GIBBONS: Seems like something you relish, links golf.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it takes a lot of creativity to play links golf.  You can do so many different things with just one club, whether you hit it low to get it to roll, hit it high, kind of work it into slopes.  I'd love to be able to be creative and play golf that way and kind of free-wheel it, rather than just aerial, play the ball in the air and let it stop.
Any time I'm able to come over and play links golf, it's definitely a treat.
Q. You talk about links golf.  Do you think a golfer has to be considered a great golfer, that he has to win on a links golf course, in terms of legacy?
PATRICK REED: I think you have to play well.  Of course, I feel like you have to win at all places in order to be, you know, considered great, whether it's links golf, whether it's back at home, anywhere in the world.
I pride myself, I want to be a worldwide player.  I want to play all around the world.  You know, I want to win in multiple places, rather than just at home.
You know, I mean, I feel like if you can win at links golf, you can win just about anywhere.  Because there are going to be times, you hit a perfect golf shot in links golf that's going to get a horrible bounce because it hits a little knob and you're in a bad shot.  Other times you're going to hit a bad shot and hit the correct side of the knob and get you in the correct spot.
It's one of those things that I feel like you have to have full control of your golf ball, the flight, the shots you're hitting but at the same time you have to have the mental toughness to handle the bad breaks you're going to get, as well as when you get the good breaks, you have to mentally manage taking advantage of those opportunities and not getting too high on yourself.
Q. Considering what you just described, the vagaries of links golf, how surprised are you that more Americans haven't come to make it a double, the Scottish and The Open?
PATRICK REED: It's definitely trending in the right direction.  I feel like a lot of the guys are seeing more of the guys come over when they play here in the Scottish, they seem to fair pretty well in the British.  They see that, maybe we need to go over a little early, play the week before, because it's completely different.
I went over and played Carnoustie on Sunday and Monday, and you know, same thing when I came here and I played nine yesterday.  It's totally different because you sit there -- it's almost like playing in Denver.  You sit there and you have 180 yards and you're hitting 9-iron.  You know how far and how much you've played that your 9-iron only goes 160, and you're sitting there and you're like, mentally, you have to allow yourself to not overswing and get out of control with it.
I feel like a lot more guys are going to start coming over, especially with how good of an event this is.  It's always great golf courses.  Always plays firm and fast, and you get the conditions as you're going to get next week and when you start seeing that, it gets you a little more comfortable going into next week, as well.
Q. No Phil Mickelson in the media centre this week.  Have you spoken much to Phil since the U.S. Open and the controversy, and what's his mind-set?
PATRICK REED: You know, I haven't really talked to Phil.  I haven't seen him.  I played Travelers and then after that, I didn't play until this week.  So I haven't had the opportunity to see him or anything like that.
You know, it's just one of those things that you know, he made a decision to do something and the USGA had to make a decision.  You know, that decision's been made and at the end of the day, you know, you've got to stand by what the rules officials say.
Q. Were you disappointed in what he did?
PATRICK REED: Honestly, I can take it or leave it.  It's one of those things that I hope I never put myself in a situation like that and at the end of the day, also, Phil, it's player dependent on what their decisions are.  All I can do is go out there and control what I do on the golf course.  You know, I mean, the USGA handled it to the best of their ability and that's up to them.
Q. Would you ever do what he did?
PATRICK REED: I hope I never get that upset to do something like that, but that's just kind of one of those things.  Every golfer has done something that they regret in their past on the golf course or off the golf course.  You know, it happens.
Q. Given your position in The Race to Dubai right now, you're No. 1.  How much of a focus is that for you, to win the Order of Merit on this side of the Atlantic, and are you planning to change any of your schedules to make sure that you do that?
PATRICK REED: Well, I'm not going to change the schedule.  I've already set my schedule on what I'm playing going forward and everything.
It's definitely on the list of things of things that I want to accomplish, and you know, it just means every time I come over and play, I've got to play well.  I've got to put myself in position to win golf tournaments and hopefully have a chance.  It's definitely something that's been on the radar, and it's always been a goal of mine to win The Race to Dubai, as well as when a FedExCup.  Hopefully I can get myself in position that I can win both the same year.
Q. On a slightly different Phil Mickelson related topic.  If the head-to-head match between Phil and Tiger was on Pay-Per-View, how much would you pay to watch it or would you only watch it if they were actually playing for their own money?
PATRICK REED: I would pay a little bit more to watch it if it was for their own money, for sure (laughter).
It's going to be entertaining.  I think it would be more entertaining if it was for their own money because I think the guys would grind even harder.  But you know, we'll just have to wait and see.  I'm curious to see kind of how it is.
I mean, I think it would be pretty cool if it was at night and kind of do something -- kind of be like a three-round, like, you know, basically three-round, just knock-out kind of thing, have old school.  Put them in persimmon woods and balata balls back in the day and put them in their normal stuff and play a round at night.  Have fun with it.
I'll be curious to see because I feel like one match, one day, 18 holes, not your own money, it's just kind of -- it's exhibition.
So with that being said, hopefully they have a lot of fun with it and give us something fun to watch.
Q. In that sense, would you like to see them mic'd up and trash-talking going on?
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  That would be the best part.  But at the same time, just got to kind of wait and see.  I just heard about it, I think like a couple days ago.  I was just kind of bored in my room.  I was just looking on ESPN and it said something about Tiger versus Phil, and I clicked on it and it said prize money is 10 million, winner-take-all.
Q. So there had not been rumours with players on the Tour whether this was going on behind the scenes?
PATRICK REED: Not at all.
Q. You were kind of a villain at The Ryder Cup in Gleneagles, and you were out there signing autographs and posing for selfies.  Do you feel like you're winning over the Scottish fans now?
PATRICK REED: I feel like what happened at Gleneagles, normally you would have thought that would have hurt, every time you come over; you would have thought you would have had more enemies.
Ever since that happened and every time I come over, the fans are unbelievable.  They have been great.  I enjoy every time coming over because of the fans.  The fans are just outstanding.
You know, I think the reason is because they saw the passion that not only do I have for my country but I have for the game of golf.  They love that kind of stuff.  You watch football matches and stuff like that; the passion that those fans have for the player and their teams, and I feel like that has really kind of connected myself with the fans and it's awesome.
Q. Are you a pupil of the history of the game and has that increased sense the Masters?
PATRICK REED: It's definitely increased a little bit.  Definitely one of the Americans that -- inaudible -- I know a decent amount.
Q. You're a big sports fan, Astros fan.  Will you be watching the semifinal tonight, and where?
PATRICK REED: I probably most likely will, and I'll probably just be in the hotel kind of resting, getting ready for tomorrow.  I'll be watching and hopefully England can go out and win their match and make it to the Finals.
