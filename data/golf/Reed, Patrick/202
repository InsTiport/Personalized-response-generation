 Q.  Tell us about your feelings on finishing this tournament in a nice, prominent position.  
PATRICK REED: I feel like I got off to a rough start today.  To be able to close out like I did on the back nine and to hole that last for par; that meant a lot because not only did it help me finish a 'lil better this week, but also carries momentum into next week.   
 Q.  Absolutely, gives you some boost into The Race to Dubai, as well as World Rankings, doesn't it?  
PATRICK REED: It does for sure.  Coming into this week, I think I was like 42nd or something like that coming into this week.  I haven't quite played as much as the other guys and any time I tee it up and play over here, I need to make sure I make every effort and make every little start count.  To go out and hopefully finish fourth, fifth, sixth this week would be great.   
 Q.  All about work and earning a living, but have you enjoyed the wider experience of Hong Kong?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  This place has been awesome.  Went a little bit of sightseeing, went up to the Peak, as well.  That was pretty cool.   
I mean, it's one of these places that you wish you spent two or three weeks here so you can actually enjoy everything, kind of see everything because there's so much to see.  Hopefully we'll come back and be able to explore some more.   
 Q.  You are used to traveling but there's a fair bit of it and quite a few miles to do, aren't there, before the end of the year.  
PATRICK REED: There is.  There's a lot of season left for me coming up so hopefully we stay rested, stay rejuvenated and put some good golf together.   
 Q.  Does this give you the boost in terms of confidence and belief with those other tournaments to come?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  This is one of those weeks that coming into it, the first two days, I hit the ball really well but didn't really putt very well.  Yesterday I felt like I hit it okay, not that great.   
But today I felt like I was really struggling with ball-striking.  And any time you can struggle on ball striking and shoot under par, especially on a final round where the wind was blowing, just shows you that if you start hitting the ball solid again, who knows what the numbers could be.
