 Q.  What was the key today?  
PATRICK REED: Biggest thing was stay patient, felt like I was doing a lot of things well this year.  Just needed to tweak little things here and there.  I decided after Bethpage to shut it down for three weeks and recover and actually take a break.  I don't usually take breaks.  That might have been the best thing for me.  Once that happened, I regrouped on what I needed to do and I built my confidence up and here we are, holding the trophy.   
 Q.  How much did your experience at the Presidents Cup play into this victory?  
PATRICK REED: A lot of it did.  The fans here are absolutely amazing.  Here in 2017, they kept us going and I felt them all here this week.  They were behind me all week.  This green has been unbelievable to me.  The past two times I stood on it, I've been holding the trophy, the Presidents Cup and here, so it's been amazing.  Thank you to the fans and thank you to Northern Trust for all that you do, and also Liberty National, the staff and golf superintendent, the golf course was perfect.  We dodged the weather.  It's unbelievable.  I can't wait to get home and share this with the wife and the little ones.
