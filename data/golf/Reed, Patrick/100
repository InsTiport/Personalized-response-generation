Q. Patrick, just back in contention a little bit.  Sad finish at the end.  Can you just explain that on the last green?
PATRICK REED: Not really.  Hit a good drive and thought I hit a good wedge shot into the green.  I had 133 covered.  The way the ball was flying it's a full 51.  Hit it perfect, nice tight draw right if the flag.
When I saw people kind of waiving back I knew it was kind of coming down the hill.  It happened to be unfortunate it got around the corner of the green where I was on the green, had to go over the fringe, through about seven feet of fringe and back on the green and I thought I could putt it and I pulled out putter first time and I gave it extra because I knew it was going to either pop or come out slow.
I just didn't hit it hard enough, obviously.  Absolutely killed it and the ball rolled back down to where it was.  I knew there was no way I could putt it.  It had to be a chip.  I chipped and ended up there to 6 inches and tap-in.
Q. Obviously disappointed but just your overall thoughts on being back in contention.
PATRICK REED: It was good.  It felt good.  Just too many mistakes out there.  Too many missed putts and really what hurt me was yesterday missing two 3-footers for birdie and, you know, just a couple careless mistakes throughout the whole week.
I felt like I played solid today.  I really didn't feel like I did anything wrong on the last when I walked off with a 5.  Yeah, it's disappointing.  At the end of the day, back in contention.  Having a chance to win a golf tournament is always fun.
