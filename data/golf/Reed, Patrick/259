Q. Very consistent the last two days.PATRICK REED: Yeah, seems like earlier this year, once I got off to a slow start, kind of -- inaudible -- when I got off to a fast start and took care of mistakes and when I got off to a low start, I started pressing.  I just stuck to my game plan, played a little conservative. Mainly don't think ahead and I just focus on what I'm doing and right now, getting good speeds on the green and focus on the first tee shot and just take it from there.
