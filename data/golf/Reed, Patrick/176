PATRICK REED: I hit my iron shot, I thought it was going to be good and it ended up flying the green and almost hitting people it flew so far. 
So, besides that one, I felt like that the wind was consistent and it was the first time probably ever setting up on 12 and then actually feeling the same as what the whole golf course is. So, 12 became a lot easier for me. 


PATRICK REED: No. I wish it was blowing even harder. When you're sitting as poorly down the leaderboard as I am, you want it to blow more. 
Unfortunately, I've been making stupid errors and not executing my golf shots the way I need to and you can't do that around here. You'll shoot over par every day. And that's what I've been doing.
