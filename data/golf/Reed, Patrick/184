 Q.  What was working so well for you?  
PATRICK REED: I feel like the main thing was sticking to my game plan.  I've hit the ball real solid the past two days.   
Yesterday I had a couple loose drivers I kind of hung a little right.  I fixed that day.  Seemed like I was hitting the driver a lot better.  Hitting the ball in play and in the fairway.  Yesterday I only hit five fairways through 18 holes.  Today I hit my driver a lot better, a lot straighter.  I was able to capitalize on that.  Hitting in the fairway, especially with it being this windy, I was able to control my golf ball and get it on the green.   
 Q.  This is a mano a mano event here.  How comfortable are you with that?  
PATRICK REED: I love it.  I love match play.  Just one of these things that I've always loved.  I seem to do it pretty well.   
The main thing is just to continue playing some good golf.  Any guy out here, if they are playing their best golf, it's going to be a challenge.  The main thing is to get some rest, continue doing what I'm doing and hopefully take care of it tomorrow.
