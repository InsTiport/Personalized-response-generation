  PATRICK REED:   Just one of those days, hit my shots pretty solid.   I haven't really putted the ball well all week and I was able to get it rolling, and doing that, it let a lot of pressure off.   I made a lot of putts and I was able to have confidence in my game that I can could actually start firing at some of these pins. 

Q.   How far away do you think you'll be at the end of the day?
PATRICK REED:   You know, I'll probably be two or three shots out.   I knew I had to do something really spectacular today.   The main thing was to get myself up there and see if we can get as high as possible.   At the start of the day, we were 30th.   Guys were playing well this morning. 

Q.   Is the great form starting to return to you?
PATRICK REED:   It is.   I'm hitting the ball great.   The main thing for me is I have to make putts.   We've worked pretty hard on it these past couple weeks and it was finally good to see a lot of putts go in. 

Q.   You got off to a fast start, 4‑under through your first six holes. 
PATRICK REED:   I played pretty solid.   All week I was hitting the ball pretty well.   Yesterday I was a little up‑and‑down on ball‑striking but really wasn't making any putts. 
Today I started rolling some good putts and made a few.   You know, on that first hole, I hit two really good, solid shots, first off the tee and then an iron shot in.   I had about a 12‑footer and felt like I hit a good putt but it didn't go in.   But it's good to hit a good putt at the start of the day to get the confidence going for the rest of the round. 
I love to edge putts, burn left edge or burn right edge.   Seems it's either dying too fast or hit a little too firm. 

Q.   Three birdies in a row on 15, 16, 17. 
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, it's always good to end well.   Gives you confidence and motivation going into next week. 
15 was just a perfect number for me.   That was nice.   And hit a great wedge shot on 16 and finally to get one back on that par 5 that was eating me up all week. 

Q.   And the approach into 18, if you turned it just a little bit‑‑
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, for sure, the putt on 18 was one I didn't want to get too cute with it because the last thing I want to do is make a five on the last. 
I gave myself a chance.   Thing is, and I gave credit to that pin just a little too much, just short. 

Q.   You gave everyone something to think about on the golf course. 
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, for sure.   I'll probably be out by two or three but got my name up on leaderboard and good for FedExCup and good for World Ranking and everything else. 

Q.   With 99 percent certainty, looks like you will be in the field for East Lake. 
PATRICK REED:   That's awesome and I hope that's true.   Hopefully I can keep playing well to get that top spot and hopefully have a chance to win the FedExCup this year.
