Q. Seemed to be a grind out there.  What do you think was your biggest challenge this morning?
PATRICK REED: I just think the biggest thing is -- well, neither of us, we didn't ham-and-egg is very well.  I felt like one guy was in the hole and one guy was out of the hole.  The way you're successful in best-ball is you have both guys in the hole, both guys having a chance to look for birdies and just seemed like we didn't.
And when we did, they weren't close.  They were lengthy putts.  Putts that percentage-wise are not very good.  It was just one of those days that was just a little bit of a struggle.
Q. Can you talk through your exchange on the 15th hole with Tiger?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, we were just trying to figure out what we wanted to do.  You know, it just was one of those that at the end of the day, we felt like the lay-up would have been a little better option.
Q. Plenty of golf still to go, and obviously the team has the lead right now.  What's your biggest take way from this morning?
PATRICK REED: I think the biggest thing is I felt like -- I can't speak for Tiger, but my game, I feel like I was hitting the ball off the tee really well, and on top of it, I felt like I was -- I felt like I was in control kind of my golf swing.  Biggest thing is we've just got to make some putts and just make a little bit bigger and better decisions.
Q. You planning to work on anything this afternoon?
PATRICK REED: I went out and just kind of did my normal warm-down.  I felt like I did a lot of things well, I wouldn't say great, but with this kind of format, we only have, I think six total birdies total -- no, seven total birdies, maybe eight as a team.  The problem is we did them on the same holes, and when you do that, it defeats the purpose.  If you have eight or nine birdies on different holes, that's what you need around a golf course like this.
Unfortunately we made too many pars.
