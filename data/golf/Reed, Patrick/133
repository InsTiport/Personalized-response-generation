Q. 4-under today, how do you feel about it?
PATRICK REED: Not too pleased.  I didn't really feel like I hit the ball very well.  And yeah, I was 2-over early by just a stupid error on a par 4 by trying to go for it out of the bunker and ended up in the water.
Good thing I putted pretty well.  I made a lot of long putts.  I made a decent-length one on 18, a decent-length one on 1.  And you know, I just felt like I left so many, not only putts, but shots out there.  I guess you had to be somewhat pleased if you're pretty disciplined with how you played and still shot 4-under.
It's out there for the taking.  I just need to go out there and put three good rounds together and get back into this thing.
Q. You've obviously had great year with The Ryder Cup and everything.  What was the highlight of the year for you?
PATRICK REED: Oh, man, probably the win at Barclays or Ryder Cup.  I would probably have to say it would have to be The Barclays.  I had so many Top 10s all year, and then at the end of last year, I had a ton of Top 10s, as well, and wasn't quite able to get over that hump to get a victory.  That was wearing on me a little bit.
For how well I've been playing and just not quite closing tournaments off; I felt like because of being able to close off Barclays, it allowed me to carry some momentum into the rest of the Playoffs and allowed me to play pretty well at Ryder Cup.
Q. At the end of the year, what will you be doing for Christmas?
PATRICK REED: Sitting on the couch hopefully.  I just kind of hang out at the house.  You know, I'll be traveling so much.  I'll be back home December like 15, and so from that point on, just kind of lay low, hang out with the family, have some home cooked meals and kind of hang out.
