Q. Just some comments on your match today.  What was working well for you?
PATRICK REED: I feel like I was doing everything pretty solid.  We had opposite winds today and it was pretty windy.  I thought the main thing to do was hit a couple more fairways.  Yesterday I only hit five.  The ball wasn't quite staying in.  It was key for me today getting the ball in play so I could have easier shots to the green.  Because of that I was able to hit a lot more greens and keep the pressure on.
Q. Are you starting to get more comfortable on this course?
PATRICK REED: With this kind of golf course, they are polar opposites, the nines.  So you have to know if it's windy on that front nine, it's not going to blow quite as hard.  When you get to the back nine, you better expect to howl it.  As long as you have control of your golf ball, I feel like anyone's game could play out here.  Keep on playing.
Q. How much attention to you pay to your bracket?
PATRICK REED: Not much.  I know at the end of the day what I need to do is go out and play golf.  If I go out and play my best golf, then I don't have to worry about it.  It's nice.
Last year I lost my first match and then won my last two.  At the end of the day, I still had to hope for somebody else to do something.  Being in this driver's seat, where I won my first and second, all I have to do is go out and play well and take care of tomorrow then I move on.  That's all I can hope for is to be in the driver's seat rather than hoping on other guys.  It's one of those things, I finally got myself in the right position and hopefully continue to play.
Q. You played some solid golf.  You have to be very pleased?
PATRICK REED: Hit the ball better today.  I hit it pretty solid yesterday, just the stats weren't quite there.  Either too aggressive off the tee or just taking not the right shots with the wind.
Today my key was to focus on really putting my ball in play, getting in the fairway, leave yourself better opportunities to hit those greens.  I was able to do that today and keep the pressure on him.  Any time you have -- I think I only missed one or two greens.  Any time you do that, the golf course is a lot easier.
Q. 2-0 start.  Pretty solid?
PATRICK REED: Last year I was 1-1 going to the last round.  I needed some help from Willett and that didn't happen.  It feels a lot better this year going to our final match in our group play, basically in my own hands.  If I go play some good golf, take care of myself, I move on.  If not, then we'll just have to wait and see.  Kind of one of those things a little better position this year and hopefully I can continue the momentum and play some good golf.
