Q. The three holes in a row middle of the back nine.  You got lucky there at 18, but you really pulled off a great shot?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, you know, with how 16 and 17 kind of transpired, I just felt like I didn't hit quality golf shots.
Then here on 18, I got lucky with the tee shot.  It was hooking pretty hard left.  To have an alleyway all the way up the green, it was a wedge shot you could get close, but I you would couldn't quite tell from where I was how fast it was moving.  To see it hit the flag and end up inches was always nice.
Q. Looked like the wind picked up pretty much when you guys got to the back nine there?
PATRICK REED: The wind started pumping.  That's thing about this golf course is once you get to the back nine, if the wind is blowing a little bit on the front, it's usually blowing twice as hard on the back because you are down near the water.
It just makes for some excitement and some great golf, especially during match play.  Charl and I were able to do that and give someone somewhat of a show.
Q. The match with you and Jordan tomorrow.  You guys have been teammates on Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup teams.  Should be an interesting day tomorrow.
PATRICK REED: It's going to be fun.  Any time I get to play with Jordan, whether it's as a teammate or against him, it's always a good day at the golf course.  Hopefully both of us go out and play really good golf and give all these fans something really fun to watch.  Just have a good day.
Q. Talk about your match tomorrow with Jordan.
PATRICK REED: It's going to be a lot of fun.  I played a lot with him as a teammate, but we haven't really had many times going up against each other.  Looking forward to it, I know he is as well.  It's going to be a good day to go out and play some golf and give the fans something to watch.  Hopefully I'll make a lot of birdies.
