Q. Patrick talk about the back-9 there and both par-3s.
PATRICK REED: For sure.  You know, it's interesting, both par-3s I missed the green, chipping in on both of them.  Chipped in late last night and this morning I chipped in.
So, the game feels good.  Feel like I'm in a good position, just get the ball-striking a little bit around this morning because I feel like I hit a couple loose shots, one loose iron shot on 15, loose iron shot on 16 and really I hit a good 3-wood on 18.  Happened to literally draw three yards more than I wanted to.  Took a nasty kick.  Besides that, the game feels solid.
Q. Not much time.  Good luck in Round 2.
PATRICK REED: Thank you.
