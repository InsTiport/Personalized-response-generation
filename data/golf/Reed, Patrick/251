Q. Solid round of golf .  It was tough out there.  The wind was swirling a little bit.  You drove the ball great, but it's a tough golf course right now as firm as it was in the afternoon?PATRICK REED: Yeah, I definitely improved on what I didn't do very well yesterday.  Yesterday I putted pretty well.  I hit the ball solid with my irons.  My driving yesterday was awful.  I got out here this morning and put a little extra work on it.  I'm happy to see myself hit some fairways.  I hit fairways and I had to make putts.  I needed all aspects of the game going at the same time.  So I need to keep this thing close and hopefully have a chance on Sunday.Q. What happened on 16 there, was that just kind of getting a little ahead of something, trying to track something down?PATRICK REED: No, I hit an 8.  I wasn't trying to hit it full.  My max on my full swing goes about 175, 167.  And it was 144 to cover.  I came close, but it didn't cover, which was shocking.Q. What's your thoughts going into the weekend?  We have no idea what's going to happen with the weather.  If the golf course stays firm, par is a good score?PATRICK REED: Yeah, sure.  The golf course last year was really soft.  This year it seems like you're getting the extra bounce.  And even on the putts it seems to keep rolling a little bit.  If it keeps blowing like this and stays sunshine it's going to be very firm the next two days.  And hopefully we can get something going.
