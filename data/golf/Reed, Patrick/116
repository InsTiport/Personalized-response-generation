 Q.  How would you assess your round?  
PATRICK REED: It was solid.  It was a steady, just kind of solid day.  It wasn't anything spectacular but at the same time it wasn't anything to get in your head about.  It was just kind of one of those days that I hit the ball pretty well.  Just made some putts and felt like I left a couple out there.  But I missed a green and seemed to miss it in the right spot and was able to get up-and-down.   
 Q.  When you look at the way today transpired, four leaders, three of the four bogeyed the first hole and the rest of the day was back and forth before Jordan pulls away.  Does that give you confidence going into tomorrow that you can have that traffic going in both directions?  
PATRICK REED: I mean, the problem is Jordan is pulling away.  You know, I think, what is he, 12- or 13-under par?  The way he's been playing that back nine, he'll probably birdie one of the last two coming in.  You know, it's just one of those things that with how thick the rough is around here, especially early, that front nine is more narrow than the back nine.  If you start missing some fairways, it's a very good opportunity you're going to have a chance of making bogey.   
A lot of times, you either can't get to the green or if it does get to the green it's coming out too hot and takes off.  It's just scrambling mode immediately.  Just one of those things that you have to come out and in the position that I'm in, you have to come out and get off to a pretty hot start and go out and shoot, you know, pretty good, low number and try to play bogey-free.   
You're going to have to ask for some help from the guy at the top because he's separating himself where if he goes out and shoots even -- if he goes out and shoots even par and gets to 12-under, that means a lot of us are going to have to shoot 4- or 5-under just to catch him.   
You know, it's one of those things that he went out and tore up the back nine yesterday and seems like he tore up the back nine today.  We are just going to have to go out and play the best golf we can and just hope.   
 Q.  Does this course lend itself to an aggressive nature that you can catch him?  
PATRICK REED: Yes and no.  It seems like these greens are so slopey and are starting to firm up, that it's hard to get the ball really close.  I mean, you can get to eight to 15 feet but to go and kick in for birdies, it seems like the golf course doesn't lend too many of those.  At the same time, they seem to put flags around the edges, so if you short-side yourself and miss the greens, a lot of times you're running away from the hole and the best you can do is get it to seven feet.   
You just have to pick your battles and I'm just going to go in and play the way I've been playing this week and get the putter hot and give myself an opportunity.  Whether it's 30 feet or 15 feet, I feel like I can make any putt I look at right now and that's key.  If I can get the putter hot early and let it roll and hopefully I have a special day on the greens and just go shoot a low number.  The last thing I want to do is go out there and start being too aggressive, because if I do that, it's just going to lead to countless bogeys.
