 Q.  How will the delay change your mind-set?  
PATRICK REED: Not much.  It's one of those things, if you know it's going to happen at some point, you just prepare for it and just make sure that you just restart whenever the time comes, whenever you have to actually go back out.  I think that's the biggest key is not doing too much walking around, not doing too much to exert too much energy.   
 Q.  Forecast looking to be the same over the next day or two, how do you prepare for what could be another long couple of days here?  
PATRICK REED: Kind of the same thing.  You have to conserve energy.  Tomorrow, you never know, you might play 36 and be done, or tomorrow you might play six holes.  You never know.  The weather looks suspect tomorrow, as well.  It's just one of those things.
