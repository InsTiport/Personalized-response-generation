Q.   What a nice way to finish after a couple frustrating lipouts, on the way home you finish style and make a nice 13‑foot birdie putt on 18?
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, felt like I was doing a lot of things okay and decent.   I didn't feel like I did anything extremely well.   I kept on giving myself chances and Felt like I was doing a lot of things okay today and decent.   I didn't feel like I did anything real little extremely well.   It's just I kept on giving myself chances.   I got a little hot streak right there, hitting the ball pretty close to the flag.   Seemed like the closer I got to the hole, the more I missed it.   So unfortunately I wasn't through that stretch.   But it's always nice to finish the round off with a birdie.

Q.   Didn't take much with this grain to get the ball off line on those putts no matter what the distance is. 
PATRICK REED:   No, it doesn't.   They are really grainy and also if it's downgrain, downwind, it's pretty quick.   Same thing if it's right‑to‑left, if the wind is coming off that right, it's going to snap.   Just minor adjustments for me going into tomorrow and hopefully I can turn in some good play.
