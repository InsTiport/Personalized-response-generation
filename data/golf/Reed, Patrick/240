 Q.   Having lost your first match, it was essential you got going and won the next two.   How does it feel doing that?   
PATRICK REED:   It feels good.   The first round felt like I didn't make any putts.   When you lose the first one, you know your back up is against the wall and you have to win going out.   To be able to play very solidly the last two rounds, especially late in the day, I made a lot of putts and today I made a lot of clutch and solid putts, which is key to match play.  
   
 Q.   How does your World Match Play compare to your expectations?   
PATRICK REED:   Oh, it's great.   It's one of those events I've always wanted to play.   Watched it last year on TV back home.   Justine, my wife, goes, "I think we need to play there next year or whenever we get a chance."   And luckily we got an invite this year and I couldn't pass it up.  
   
 Q.   We don't know who you'll play, could be Stenson when you played in Ryder Cup singles, that would be cool, wouldn't?   
PATRICK REED:   Oh, it would.   Henrik is a good friend of ours, so any time we can play with him or against him is always fun.   
   
 Q.   Two wins after two, you're in the quarterfinals.   
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, any time you move on and get to the elimination, that means I'm playing well and doing a lot of things right.   Seemed like today I tried not to get ahead of myself and tried to do exactly what I did yesterday, since I played really well yesterday and got off to the same kind of start, hit the ball really well and was making some putts.  
   
 Q.   Just the one wayward tee shot on 10, but that seemed to be the spur from the second half of the round.   You built a bit of an advantage?  
PATRICK REED:   Making a really clutch putt on 9 to go up on two, I felt like I was in great position.   They fooled me by moving the tees up on 10 and making it drivable, and I decide to swing a little hard at that one and tried to really get it up there.   Unfortunately was a little late on the club.   Besides that hole I played really well and made a lot of putts and kept the pressure on him.   
Jamie is a great player, and it showed, not only this week but at Ryder Cup and other weeks.   I knew it wasn't over until the last putt's made and I knew he has the firepower that if he gets going, he's going to hit a lot of close ones.   He hit it to inside a foot on 15.   And 16, I don't know what iron he hit but hit that iron inside basically gimmie range, as well.
