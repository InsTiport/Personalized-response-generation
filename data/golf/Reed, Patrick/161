Q. Talk about your 66 today.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it was a good round.  I felt like I finally hit the ball a lot better, and I felt like I was putting well.  Just for some reason I couldn't get the speeds.  They felt a little slower in morning on the putting green, and when I got to the golf course I left -- a lot of putts seemed to be short and then I hit a couple a little firm, so my speed wasn't quite where I needed it to be.  I'll take 66, but I knew it could have been a lot better.
Q. Opening ceremony on Friday night, did you get a chance to watch it?  Now that it's underway, are you excited?
PATRICK REED: I can't wait.  I can't wait to get on a flight and go down, but I didn't have the opportunity to go watch it.  It was my birthday, so we went out to grab a nice dinner, and by the time I got home, I had a text on my phone saying I had a 7:22 tee time.  I was like, you know what, I need to go to bed.  I just went straight to bed and got up for the round.
Q. If I had told you you were going to shoot a 66 today and Jim Furyk was going to give you seven shots on top of that but you still would lose, would you buy it?
PATRICK REED: No, not really.  I mean, I didn't see 12-under out there.  It was pretty cool whenever we were starting out this morning and just looking at the leaderboard, all of a sudden I see 4-under through five, 6-under through I think it was eight or something like that, whatever the ridiculous numbers it was, and I was sitting here going, he's 11-under through 12.  I'm sitting here going, he's going to shoot 55.  I'm thinking, well, he's going to birdie 13 if he hits the fairway.  With the way he's playing, 14 he's probably going to have a good look, 15 is drivable.  I'm sitting here going through my head, he might shoot 55 today.  For him to shoot 58 like that out of those holes, he didn't do much through that stretch, but then he goes and birdies 16.  Out of all those holes you're going to birdie a really hard par-3 today.  That was cool.  It was good to see.  Hopefully I can kind of get on that side of the mojo and start getting some good things.
Q. What was working on the front nine for you, 3-under?
PATRICK REED: I want to say I really -- I felt like I was hitting the ball okay.  Driver was, I felt, solid, just like it was all week.  I felt like yesterday was the only day I didn't really hit the driver well.  But my iron play was pretty solid, and really that's about it, because yeah, I made a good putt on 4, but my other birdies were pretty short putts.  I hit it really close on -- 6 is playing like a par-4 today because it's complete opposite winds.  It's downwind.  All week I've been hitting driver, 5-wood short of the green, and today I had a softy 3-iron into the green.  That hole played so much easier.  Hit it just greenside, two-putt, and then 7 I hit a great drive there and hit a nice little wedge shot in there, hit it to like three feet.  Really it just wasn't anything special, just kind of doing everything that I'm supposed to do.  When I have a wedge in my hand, hit it close, and when I have an opportunity on par-5s to go for it in two, get it up there where it's an easy birdie.  I just need to continue dialing in my distances a little bit.  Distance control was a tad off again today.  But all in all, it was a solid week.  I think it's so far going to be my best finish here.  I'm not really sure.  It's always good to come out and post no rounds over par this week and post a couple rounds in the 60s on my birthday.
Q. Obviously you came in wanting to win, but now when you look back on it, did you get what you needed for Rio?  Did you get what you needed out of this tournament for the Olympics do you think?
PATRICK REED: Well, I didn't get everything I needed.  I needed a W.  You know, I feel like the game is trending in the right direction.  I felt like I was hitting my driver a lot better.  I found the driver this week, Tuesday, which was really good, and I feel like I'm just fine-tuning everything.  Everything seems to be going pretty straight.  I just need to work on distance control, which is a pretty easy thing to work on.  At least I'm not trying to tweak my golf swing.  I just had to look at a number and go, well, if I hit this full it's going to go this far.  That's really the only thing I need to work on.  Have you ever played four rounds with Bubba.
PATRICK REED: No, but it was capital punishment this week having to play with Bubba.  Having the capital punishment, having to play with Bubba for four days, now all of a sudden to have to go hop on a plane with Bubba, and then I have a week at Rio with Bubba.  Yeah, I mean, it's Bubba.  At least it's entertaining.  We have a great time when we're out there playing.  It should be fun.  It was good because we were comfortable out there all week, and really when you play with somebody the first two days and then you continue on the next two days, it's actually pretty easy because you know exactly what to kind of expect and everything like that.
Q. Did you learn anything new about him with all this playing time with him?
PATRICK REED: No.  I know him pretty well, so nothing really new.  The only thing I did realize that I actually kind of knew, that I found out that was different, was either I'm getting longer or he's getting older, one or the other, because my distance is a little bit closer to him.  Instead of getting outdriven by 50, I'm only getting outdriven by like 45.
Q. What's the plans as far as traveling?  When do you hop on a plane?  Do you have to go through processing anywhere?
PATRICK REED: Good question.  I'll have to contact Andy Levinson and figure out all the details.  He has everything.  He told us that I'd have an email whenever I got done with the round.
Q. How much do you appreciate someone shooting 58 at a tournament?  You're out here every week.  As a golfer how much do you look at Jim shooting 58 --
PATRICK REED: It's impressive.  I mean, it's impressive.  He's had a 59 before and now a 58.  Really, he birdied the harder holes.  He didn't birdie like 13 and 15, the two easy holes on the back nine.  He didn't even birdie those.  It could have been really, really low.  I would have loved to have signed a scorecard for a 58 on Sunday and walked away and not even showed up.
