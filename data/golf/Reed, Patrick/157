  PATRICK REED: It was awful. I didn't hit the tee shots very well, and every fairway I missed, I missed in the wrong spot. Can't do that around here. I mean, every drive I hit was basically a penalty shot because I was either plugged in a bunker or shortâ€‘sided where I had no shot to the green or in a bush. You can't do that. Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.

Q. You didn't get to play a lot of holes without the wind, right? 
PATRICK REED: No. I played the first hole without really much wind. And besides that, yeah, the wind was blowing, but at the same time, you can't hit the ball as poorly as I did. 

Q. When you saw what Rickie was doing, did it give you hope that maybe the course was a bit gettable? 
PATRICK REED: Not really. Because it plays completely different in the morning than it does in the afternoon. And honestly, I wasn't really playing attention to the leaderboard. Because when you're out here and the wind is blowing, you're trying to focus on your golf ball and trying to figure out where it's at and what you're going to hit. It's just something that unfortunately I didn't do well. Yeah, I just didn't really strike it very solid.
