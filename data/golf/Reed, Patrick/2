  Q. Assess the round, obviously people love hearing you and in match play settings, so compared to other match play rounds, how did this shape up?
 PATRICK REED:   Yeah, it was ugly.  It was ugly early and winning holes with pars (wind noise) and then we started playing some good golf on the back nine, started getting hot.  There was a stretch there where I made three birdies in four holes and he basically matched me and we fought there.  And being 2-down, two to play, I birdied one and then him giving me this gift on 18 was nice.  But got to play better, got to hit the ball better, got to make some putts.  But just felt like that was kind of the sum of the day, just hit a lot of putts where I was looking, the ball just didn't go in.
 Q. Is this something you're going to mull over all night or shake it off?
 PATRICK REED:   No, not at all.  That match looked like I was going to lose, when I was 2-down through 14 and it wasn't looking good.  Then I think I was 2-down through 15 as well, after he hit it to four feet.  At that point it was looking like, all right, well let's see how far we can kind of get it going, find something in the swing, find something on the greens, just kind of build on for tomorrow, and we were able to come out with a halve.
