Q.   So how are you feeling about tomorrow?
PATRICK REED:   Feeling good.   Hitting the ball great.   Didn't make many putts.   Get some work this afternoon and hopefully tomorrow have a chance.   Ballâ€‘striking is there, putting is there.   Just one of those days.   To feel like you don't have the putting and still be able to shoot 67 is always positive. 

Q.   Were the greens a little bumpy out there today.
PATRICK REED:   They are a little bumpy but if you hit a good putt, it was going in.   So it wasn't because of the greens I didn't wasn't putting well.   Just something I have to work on and hope to play great tomorrow. 

Q.   You've been spending a lot of time on the road the last few months? 
PATRICK REED:   We have, it's been a lot of fun.   Whenever you're out here playing a PGA TOUR event, it's always a blast.   And to actually have a set schedule where you know where you're going, it's a lot easier.   Last year we didn't have any set schedule and so we were traveling and doing every Monday qualifier possible.   So this year it's a lot easier. 
Basically you know, okay, I'm going here to there and there's no question about it.   It's a lot less hectic.

Q.   You must be one of the only guys on the TOUR with a wife that caddies for him?
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, I am.   It's awesome.   I could spend every day around my wife, it's a lot of fun and it's a great experience.
