Q.   You're in first place after round No. 1, what were you doing so well today and yesterday?
PATRICK REED:   Yesterday I just didn't get myself into trouble.   I felt like I hit a lot of good shots, hit a lot of greens, and I was making some good putts.   Today just seemed I started off with a really solid 4‑iron to three feet on the par3, 5, which jump‑started the round.   It's playing tough out there.   Just got to keep doing what I'm doing, make some putts and hit solid shots. 

Q.   How do you think it going to play this afternoon? 
PATRICK REED:   It's windier today.   I didn't think it could get windier than yesterday but it's blowing hard today.   There's downwind iron shots into greens that you only need to fly it the front edge.   They are very firm and very fast, and hopefully you can give yourself a putt uphill. 
Usually in the mornings, it's a little calmer than normal.   So I was hoping to be able to come out and have a pretty calm couple holes left to play, but got here and realized it's blowing probably two times harder today than it was yesterday. 
I just had to stay patient like I did all day yesterday and this morning, and keep making some putts.

Q.   And it's blowing from the other direction; how big of an adjustment was that?
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, it's a big adjustment, that's for sure.   But the good thing is, you know, with my note taking, I took notes on what kind of game plan I'm going to have if it's into the wind and downwind.   I have both covered so hopefully I can go out and do some of the same things.

Q.   Did it help not having any preconceived notions? 
PATRICK REED:   Maybe, I heard a lot of great things about the old golf course.   Unfortunately I never got to be able to see it, but I've seen the new one, I love the new changes that they have said they have made.   It's a fun course and it's a challenging one when the wind blows.
