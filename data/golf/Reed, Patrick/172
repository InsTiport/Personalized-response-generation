Q. Patrick, what a way to start this tournament, 4 under, very solid for the first round, but you dominated those par 5s out there today.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it was one of those days that we knew exactly what we had to do early, especially on the first par 5, 11.  I knew after that point, if you had a good drive, you have an opportunity to knock it on all three of the greens.
I just happened to hit great tee shots, set myself up, and hit the right iron shot at the right time, and I was able to make a couple putts.
Any time you can come in here and shoot 4 under to start a golf tournament, it's pretty exciting.
Q. Give us an idea of those conditions as we start round 1.
PATRICK REED: Probably the easiest they'll ever play.  Greens are pretty soft.  Fairways are soft.  Greens are pure.  You're standing there and wondering, is it going to be a yard into or a yard down with the wind because there's none.  It was basically one of these days that you had to go out and shoot a low number.  Around here, a 4 is a pretty good score.
Hopefully, I can continue good play and do some more tomorrow.
