 Q.  Tell us about some good things, because you're in a nice position, aren't you, after two days here?  
PATRICK REED: Yeah, anytime you're close to the lead, especially around 9- or 10-under par, you always have to be happy with where you stand.   
But I was out there today, I had a chance of getting it going, if I just got some putts to the hole.  I seemed to not be able to hit them for some reason.  But besides that, I scrambled really well and it was nice enough to have two birdies the last three holes to get the thing under par for the day and just get that closer to the lead.   
 Q.  Which means you're in a fine position, a lot of positives, how long does it take to get the frustration out of the system?  
PATRICK REED: It will probably take a good -- probably 30 minutes.  I felt like I had to hit some fairways.  I didn't really hit many fairways today, unlike yesterday.  Yesterday I seemed to hit a lot more fairways, and especially when it's windy around here, playing out of the rough, with how wet it is.  I mean, that rough is just so thick; it's just a guessing game.   
And I did a good job yesterday of keeping myself out of the short grass, and if I missed a fairway or was just in that first cut, which isn't bad.  But today, it just seemed like the driver was more and more off-line and got myself in some bad positions.   
I scrambled pretty well to get out of a lot of them, but unfortunately I had two mishaps.  But still shot under par on a tough day like that.   
 Q.  I take it by extension, it was just hard to adjust to the change in the elements here with the wind swirling around the trees.  
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I didn't really feel like the conditions were as tough for me.  Just my tee shots, I wasn't starting them down the lines I wanted to.   
For me it kind of seems a little bit more swing-oriented, rather than conditions, because when I did hit the fairway, I seemed to really light up the flags.  And the par 3s I seemed to hit pretty solid iron shots.  Distance-wise, you have to make sure you get that swing going where you hit the ball straight and not crooked, especially around here.   
 Q.  Speaking about experience, I take it with your experience now, you can regroup and just know you're in a nice challenging position into the weekend?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  If you put four rounds under par here, and you maybe get hot for two or three rounds, then you have a good week and you should have a chance to come down on Sunday.  Hopefully we can just put the pedal down tomorrow and go out and shoot a nice low number and hopefully climb the leaderboard a little bit more.
