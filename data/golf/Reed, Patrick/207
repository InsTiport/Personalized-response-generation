Q. Patrick, what was the key for you today?  5-under, great round, solid play, just the one bogey?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, my putting.  I felt like I made a lot of putts.  I didn't really feel like I hit the ball as good as I should have, but my short game today was a lot sharper than it was the last two days.  That's the key around here.
Q. Did you feel like having a little more rest than the other players helped you?
PATRICK REED: Not really, because I'm sick.  I haven't really slept, it feels like, in three or four days.  I keep waking up at 2:00 in the morning coughing my brains out.  I think that's probably one of the big things, I'm keeping my head out of the way.
Q. What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?  You're close, you're there, what's it going to take from you?
PATRICK REED: Seems like everyone is lighting it up today.  I think the lead will probably be around 13 or 14.  I need to shoot 9- or 10-under par to win it.
