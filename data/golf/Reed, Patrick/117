 Q.  There's something about the northeast and you; it certainly gets your blood pumping.  Strong 3-under par round today gets you back in the tournament.  
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it was a rough start, seeing like a lot of missed fairways and trying to hack out of this rough, which is just brutal.  But I was able to kind of right the ship, and when I did hit a green, I ended up hitting it pretty close.  Because I learned from yesterday, you have to play pretty aggressive to these flags, because if you play to the fast side of the greens, it seems like every time, you're having a three and a half to four percent slope downhill putt.  It's almost the worst spot to leave yourself.   
So the game plan today was if I got the ball in the fairway was just go ahead and attack.  You're hitting your irons well; hit it right at the flag and take your chances.  Seemed to work out.  Hopefully the lead doesn't get too far ahead of me going into tomorrow and I can go out and post another low one and hopefully get even closer.
