  Q. Clearly a very different day to yesterday's 64.  Just give us your assessment of your play today.
 PATRICK REED:   It was sloppy.  Didn't really hit the ball as well as I needed to.  Made some putts, but didn't make the putts also I needed to.  It was one of those days I had to lean a lot on my short game, and the good thing is I was able to do that and put myself into position to still have a share of the lead going into tomorrow.
 Q. Breathtaking short game at times today.  Does that come natural to you?  Is that the evidence of hundreds of hours of work?  What?
 PATRICK REED:   Kind of a mixture of both.  Ever since I was little, I always loved to be around the chipping green and loved to hit shot around the chipping green and even up-and-down kind of stuff like that.
 So I enjoy practising short game.  It's fun for me.  For some reason I just see shots and it just happens.
 Q. Opportunity tomorrow to not only win the DP World Tour Championship but also become the first American to win The Race to Dubai.  When you think about that, what goes through your mind?
 PATRICK REED:   Trying not to really think about that honestly.  If it happens, it would be unbelievable.  It was always a goal of mine obviously to win golf tournaments but to win this one and also to win The Race to Dubai and be the first American would be amazing.
 We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow.  We still have full 18 holes left and you can't really sit back there and think as much about that as just stay in the present and try to play some good golf tomorrow.
