Q.   Talk about your start.
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, you know, I mean, compared to yesterday coming out I felt like yesterday I was hitting a couple thin iron shots and didn't feel like I was getting the ball close.
Then come out, and felt like I hit a great tee shot, great iron shot on the 1st, and then felt like I hit a really good iron shot in the 2nd, you know, then the great drive on the 3rd, it seemed like it was one of those days you got off to a really hot start and was able to build momentum throughout the round. 

Q.   (Question regarding playing with Tiger.)
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, you know, I never played with Tiger before besides in a practice rounds at the British.   It was good to finally be able to play with him, especially in competition.
It was a lot of fun.   We had a good time.   I felt like we enjoyed ourselves out there, and luckily I played well.

Q.   (No microphone.)
PATRICK REED:   It didn't feel any different, really.   I mean, whenever we're stepping up on the tee‑‑ I've spent a lot of time talking to him before during practice rounds or while we're on the putting green or driving range, so I was already comfortable being around him. 
If you would've asked me that my rookie year, maybe my second tournament and I was paired with him, I would probably say something different.

Q.   If we told you your rookie year the first time you played with him you would beat him by 7, would you have believed it?
PATRICK REED:   I don't know.   Depends on how he played. 

Q.   (Question regarding wearing red and black.)
PATRICK REED:   No, you know, I mean, I think it was start of last year we started wearing red and black on Fridays as well.   Because if we didn't get off to a hot start on Thursday and we wore read and black, we seemed to play pretty well in it. 
Just happened to be one of those things.   On cut say we usually wear it, and on Sundays we wear usually it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
PATRICK REED:   You know, I mean, in a normal event you have hundreds of thousands of people there it seems like.   You know, back when everyone was really struggling when they were playing with Tiger, that was when he was also just absolutely dominating the game.
I feel like now, because of how mentally strong he was and us growing up watching that and how he played, I feel like a lot of young guys now have the same mentality.   Don't really care who they're playing with, just go out and try top play golf and play how they know how to play. 
I feel like we do that a lot better now.   I feel like I do that really well, and I feel like that's how I was able to stay in it today.

Q.   After 10 did you start thinking about how low it might go?
PATRICK REED:   Oh, yeah.   I was thinking in the 50s after 10 for sure, and then I stepped up on 11 and hit a kind of little thin block 6‑iron out to the right and didn't even know if it was going to cover.
Luckily it got on the green.   It was just one of those things once I got done with 11, I just put one foot in front of the other and continued to do what I was trying to do on the front nine, shot by shot.

Q.   (No microphone.)
PATRICK REED:   Golf course is long.   I don't know why guys are hitting a lot of 3‑woods.   No, I feel comfortable with my driver right now.   I feel like I'm hitting it well, and if I'm hitting it well I feel like I know where it's going.   I mean, I don't see any point of not hitting it.

Q.   What did you think of the way Tiger was hitting it?
PATRICK REED:   I mean, it seemed fine.   Of course he didn't like the score he had.   He had a couple loose shots here and there, but he knows what he's doing.
When was the last time he played a competitive tournament?   It's been a while. 

Q.   A little bit of a bad break I think on 13. 
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, 12.   That hole owns me. 

Q.   What happened there?   You push the shot a little bit too much?
PATRICK REED:   No, I mean, I have a new ball in play this week, new driver, new 61.   I haven't touched a club since China, and all of a sudden I found out I got in the event last minute.
Probably wasn't really prepared and warmed up and ready to go.   Still a little rusty.   Didn't know how far the ball was flying.   Yesterday I hit a solid (indiscernible) 57,   landed it three yards past flag and just to the right of it and spun it back in the water. 
Then today I hit my drive into the rough and I was in a divot.   I was like, All right, I'm in the divot.   Just try to hit it on the right side.   If it hits in that slope it'll just come back.
It didn't spin.   It just rolled and didn't stop.   Next thing you know, it did the same thing:   it trickled, next thing you know it's in the fringe and in the water, so...
