Q. Final round, 5 under before the home crowd.  Got to feel pretty good about that.
PATRICK REED: It did.  I felt like I left the crowd down the first three days because I felt like I hit the ball really solid and I wasn't able to cap off many of the putts, so the crowd didn't really have much to cheer for.  Today, it got here a little early, had my coach come in to work a little bit with my putting.  I felt real confident and comfortable with how I was putting.  I continued hitting the ball well.  Made a couple of those crucial putts I needed to, and it was nice to see it go in, especially going into Augusta.
Q. Speaking about that, I mean, you feel pretty good about your game going into the Masters?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I feel like I'm playing great.  I just haven't really gotten anything out of my rounds.  Today I finally felt like the score kind of reflected how I hit the golf ball, and I still felt like I left a couple out there.  But besides that, you know, it was a lot better and a lot closer than where it needed to be.  I was close.  Just needed to get it going.
Q. Anything specifically you wanted to work on this week in Houston to get ready for next week?
PATRICK REED: Not really.  Just mainly make sure everything is sharp and continue to play and compete.  I love competing and playing in tournaments.  Kind of a no-brainer.  It's just kind of one of those things, the past three days I haven't really seen any putts go in.  Main key today was just continue hitting the ball well, because going into today I was 3rd in strokes gained tee to green, but I was like 70 in strokes gained putting, which is horrendous and is way below standards of where I expect to be.
So, coming in today the main focus was, you know, make sure you continue making good putts, good lines and make some putts.  Of course, I stepped up on the first hole, six-and-a-half-footer for birdie, thought I hit a good putt.  It doesn't go in, okay, here we go again.  I was able to make a lot of 8, 10, 15-footers today.  I think I made like four, five of them, which was nice to see the ball go in.
