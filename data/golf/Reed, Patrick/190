 Q.  I thought you played really good.  
PATRICK REED: Yeah.  Solid.  Today on the back nine I didn't really get anything going.  But as a whole I hit the ball great, even when I wasn't hitting the ball solid I knew where it was going.  It was one of those weeks that I got the ball in front of me, got it on the green and rolled a couple putts here and there.   
The good thing is I didn't beat myself up.  I didn't get myself into bad positions where there's no way I could get up-and-down for a par.  Unfortunately, the only bogey I had today was on that par-5 which honestly, it was probably the easiest up-and-down I had all week.  It was a putt from the fringe.  Unfortunately I didn't hit it hard enough.   
But at the end of the day if you would have told me coming into this week with the wind blowing hard third and fourth round that I was only going to have one bogey for the week, I would have taken it.   
 Q.  We talked earlier in the week about your changing your coaches and how things are clicking in and it really is.  You got to be excited about what lies ahead.  
PATRICK REED: For sure.  What Josh and I are working on is really working.  I just have to stay at it and keep grinding and turn these second, third, fourth, fifth place finishes into W's, which that's just the next step.  We're getting close, just need to keep putting the foot down and get one here soon.   
 Q.  What's the schedule ahead for you now?  When will we see you again?  
PATRICK REED: I am going back to CareerBuilders.  So I'll be over there and Torrey right after that.  So we're looking forward to those two weeks and hopefully continue the good play and have a chance come down Sunday.
