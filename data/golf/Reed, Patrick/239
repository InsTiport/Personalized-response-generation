 Q.   Four birdies and an eagle, not much wrong with your game but just a better opponent on the day?  
PATRICK REED:   I played well.   Any time you go bogey‑free and shoot 6‑under par you expect yourself to hopefully win the match.   But I mean, he played extremely well.   It was windy out here today and we both came out pretty solid in the beginning.   He went through a stretch where he birdied 10,11, 12, 13 and then made a long putt on 16 on me.     
You know, unfortunately I wasn t able to get the job done.   But carry overall the good things this week.   18‑under par through four rounds and that's pretty good if you play stroke play.   So we'll just take over the momentum hopefully going into Malaysia is my next tournament.  
   
 Q.   When your opponent hits a run like that, is there a tendency to push your game a little?   Do you have to restrain yourself so you're not chasing too much?  
PATRICK REED:   Not really.   I birdied 10,11 and 15.   Just happened that he had one more birdie there and unfortunately just wasn't enough for me.  
   
 Q.   How have you enjoyed the overall experience of playing in this tournament?  
PATRICK REED:   I had a blast.   Unfortunately I'm not playing tomorrow.   Besides that it's been a lot of fun and hopefully I come back sometime soon.   
   
 Q.   Was that the key stretch‑‑  
PATRICK REED:   I drove the green on 10.   Hit an awesome drive there.   I had a chance to win the hole.   I had probably about 18, 20 feet for eagle and unfortunately didn't make it.   He hit a good drive, easy bunker shot probably about two feet.   10 is playing almost like a par 3 today.   
And you know, I made a solid putt on 11 and he had probably about nine, ten feet and he made it.   I knew he was going to make that one.   But I made mine, I kind of thought it gave me a little more momentum.   I hit a 5‑iron just barely off the green on the next and he goes and hits 5‑iron to four feet on 12 and it just seemed‑‑ and then he goes and makes a long putt for birdie on 13.   
And then he makes a long putt for birdie on 16.   Any time you get on a run like that, hopefully the other guy can make as many birdies as possible.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to and at the same time, it was a great week, great day, and hopefully I can just continue that momentum going on for my last two events of the year.   
   
 Q.   Have you enjoyed the reception you've had, because it seems like people are taking you to heart‑‑ you've become sort of a crowd favorite.   
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, the crowds are awesome.   We had a good time.   It was just one of those days that couldn't really get the crowd really cheering too much for me due to the fact that every time I made birdie, he made birdie.   He happened to make two more than me and he played great and so did I and unfortunately that's the thing about match play, even if you play really well you can still get beat.   
You know, you don't have any other days to carry over to, just that one day, one match.   Can't really be that disappointed.   Played great.  
   
 Q.   You said yesterday you would like to be a global player.   Will we see a bit more of you next year maybe?  
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, hopefully.   I just have to look at the schedule and see where our breaks are in the PGA TOUR and which ones I'm not playing to see if I can jump over here and play an event.   I hope to play a couple more this year coming up.   Just have to wait and see.   
   
 Q.   You said yesterday you had not seen much of Jamie Donaldson.   Have you seen much of George?  
PATRICK REED:   I played him in the Match Play over in the States.   He beat me in extra holes.   But that was a match where we both played very poorly and it was just almost like a pillow fight.   Didn't know who was going to walk away with the win.     
It was totally different today.   We both played really well, 14‑under as a pair, and neither of us had a bogey.   Any time you can be 14‑under through 17 with no bogeys is pretty solid day.   Just happened to do that and he clipped me.
