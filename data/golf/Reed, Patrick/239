Q.   Patrick, tough luck, Jonas looks like he played pretty well and maybe missed a few putts.   How did it go out there for you?
PATRICK REED:   It was one much those days where both of us played pretty solid but at the end of the day I didn't really make anything.   Started out the day, felt like I hit two really good putts on 1 and 2 and I rode the high lip on 1 and lippedâ€‘out on the low side on 2. 
From there on, I matched him on 5 to stay all square and I missed a short one on 6 and seemed like that was the story of the day, just missing putts left and right.   At the end of the day, I did a lot of things well but to win these matches, especially at this level you have to make putts, and unfortunately I didn't do that.

Q.   Tomorrow you have Paul Casey; so another chance and it's not like you're out.   So that's kind of a nice thing about the future? 
PATRICK REED:   For sure.   How I've been playing, coming into today, I didn't really know what my competitive golf was going to be like.   I hit the ball really well.   Hit it a lot better than yesterday which was good.   Irons I hit about the same but I was able to find fairways, and that's key out here, play out of the fairways. 
To be able to do that and step up and have a lot of good looks for birdies, that's confident boosting.   But at the end of the day, you have to make the putts and unfortunately he made more than I did.
