 Q.  A terrific round of golf today, and big news yesterday, that Dustin Johnson is not going to go to the Olympics for the United States, effectively putting you on the team.  What are you going to do?  
PATRICK REED: You know, kind of just sticking to what I did earlier.  I would love to play for my country, and I have that opportunity and I heard that the deadline is tomorrow.  And mathematically, I think I'm a lock, I'm not 100 per cent sure.  But I'd love to play and hopefully we can go out and wear those stars and stripes.   
 Q.  Have you not made a decision yet?  Obviously the news came down last night, the deadline is on Monday, but if you are on the team, will you go?  
PATRICK REED: This is all news to me, as well.  I haven't sat in any of the meetings or anything for Team USA.  I'm going to contact, of course, our team captain and stuff and just kind of see where everything is, seeing what we do with everybody.  I'm looking forward to it.  Hopefully I can play.   
 Q.  Seems like a lot of players are taking this to the 11th hour and really consulting a lot of different people and weighing a lot of factors.  What are you weighing?  
PATRICK REED: No, really, just kind of all the factors everyone else is, you know, security, Zika, everything.  But at the same time, you know me, I'm a competitor, and whenever I can play for my country, I'm going to do it.   
 Q.  You were very competitive today, 6-under par through your first six holes.  What was the key for you today?  
PATRICK REED: You know, really through that stretch, the wind was completely opposite, so the first couple holes played really easy, and as long as you hit a driver off 1, you hit it in the fairway, you have just a chip lob-wedge.   
All I really did was hit a good one tee shot there and I really didn't feel like I hit many good iron shots or tee shots on 2; that hole has been a pain to me but I was somehow able to get it up on the green and 2-putt.   
But really the good iron shot was on 3.  That's a hard par 4 when it's downwind, especially when they put that pin front left.  I was able to hit it to 20 feet past the hole, roll in a putt.  But really, I felt like I hit the ball better yesterday than today.  Today happened to get a really hot start and a chip-in that got me 6-under through six.   
 Q.  Do you have any doubts at all with regard to Rio and the concerns that are around it?  
PATRICK REED: I wouldn't really say I have doubts.  It's just something that I need to weigh and talk to Justine and talk to everybody about -- because my phone was blowing up at 3:30, 4:00am this morning.  I didn't know what was going on.  When the phone starts blowing up that time in the hour, I'm kind of sitting there thinking, all right, what's going on at home, did something happen.   
The news to me was DJ withdrew, and obviously everyone has to respect that decision with what's going around.  We have to weigh our options and make the right decision.   
 Q.  But in principle, you're going to be there?  
PATRICK REED: As far as I know, I'm going to go and play.  But at the end of the day, I need to go and talk to the whole family and talk to my team and make sure it's the right decision.   
 Q.  How much can a responsibility to golf and a responsibility going, does that weigh in your mind at all, that pulling out, that it might damage golf in the Olympics, does that bother you?  
PATRICK REED: If there were not any question marks, I would say it would put a hit on golf.  But there's a lot of question marks being the first year it's back in the Olympics, and with those question marks, I don't feel like it's going to hurt the game, and I really feel like the only thing it can do is help.   
But at the end of the day, any time you can play for your country, I know all these guys want to go and play.   
 Q.  Being a young father yourself, can you sympathise with DJ not going?  
PATRICK REED: For sure.  Like I said, all the guys have withdrawn and decided not to play, they are all for good reasons.  It's not like they are just pulling out and saying, oh, well, you know, I just don't feel like playing that week.  That's far from the truth.  There's a lot of good reasons.  That's why I feel like whoever it is or whatever country, they have to respect that decision from their players.
