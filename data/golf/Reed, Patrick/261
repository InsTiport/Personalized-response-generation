 Q. Your thoughts on the day.PATRICK REED: Just had to putt four rounds together.  Today was rough.  I felt like I was hitting the ball well on the range.  Felt like I had a good warm up.  I started the first hole really well.  Loose iron shot, and then probably the best chip I could hit from there without getting too cute. My first putt, it hit something, and ended up like four or five feet short and then missed that.  I bounced back and -- bounced back in the front nine and just seemed like everything that could go wrong back nine, did. Yeah, I did a lot of things great this week.  But this definitely burns and definitely get me more fired up for more events coming up.
Q. On that, considering you have not played your best as of late and for good reasons with the birth of your daughter; the fact that you put yourself in the position that you did heading into today, do you take that away, as much if not more than what happened today?PATRICK REED: You know, any time you put yourself in position on Sunday to win, you know you're doing something right.  I'm going to keep on trucking along, keep working hard and hopefully keep getting myself in these positions. I was 100 percent going into this week on closing and now I'm 75 percent.  It's still pretty good odds.  So hopefully I can continue and get ourselves in that position and close it off.
