Q. I was wondering if there would be a little emotional baggage.  Certainly put a lot of effort into Sunday's round when you won the Northern Trust.  You came out here and were making birdies right away.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I was hitting the ball pretty solid early.  Missed a couple putts early on, but all in all, I was hitting it okay.  Yeah, just needed a couple better tee shots.  You can't play here out of the rough, and during the back nine the driver just didn't want to get off the ground and wanted to come out a little low.
Q. I saw a lot of good shots out there, but take me through the 14th hole, your eagle.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I was just trying to -- because I've hit a lot of cuts up until that point, I just kind of said, I'm going to hit that driver down the right-hand side, hit a draw, and I hit a good one, and I knew if I got it in the fairway I'd have a chance to get home.  I had just the right number where I could kind of hold the 3-wood instead of getting it turning so it could land softer.  I hit a good one there, and then after seeing Brooks roll his putt in, I was able to kind of see how much it was breaking towards the end.
Q. Good start for you with two good saves on the last two holes.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, appreciate it.  Those are the golf shots there that I needed to kind of calm down a little bit.
Q. Nice start, continued momentum.  Just comment on your day.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, you know, it was a solid day.  Early on I missed a couple putts that I should have made, and then after that there was just a couple of loose shots here and there, but besides that, I mean, it was a grinding day out there.  I just need to kind of clean up some of the stuff that I ended up not doing well towards the end to get it even lower.
