Q. What's it feel like to win The Barclays?
PATRICK REED: It feels awesome.  To work so hard to get to this point, and I couldn't do it without my team.  We've worked so hard, and the people on the inside, my sponsors and my wife and my team at home, without them, this wouldn't have been possible.  Just shows how the hard work we did all year finally paid off.
Q. You had a bogey and then a birdie at the par 5, and the chip-in was huge.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I felt like I was swinging really well, especially early on.  I told Kessler once we got to 5, sitting there going, we should have birdied 1, should have birdied 2, should have parred 3, should have eagled 4, and I chip-in for birdie at 5.  I felt like that was the worst I could have been playing was the score I was having.
I just built on that momentum of how well I was hitting the golf ball and I knew if I continued to have some looks, I would make some putts.  I did enough early and through the middle of the round where at the end, my nerves got a hold of me, and things I was working on with my coach, I reverted back to some of the old swings.  It was nice to have that lead and I was glad I had it because I needed every one of them.
Q. And 17 you made the par putt.
PATRICK REED: I felt like a bad tee shot on 16, felt like I hit a really good putt that lipped-out.  17, I hit a good iron shot and I get up there and it's up against the collar and the collar got me.  The collar grabbed me on the way back and I wanted to continue the smooth stroke.  Leaving it seven feet short, I knew I had to make that because you don't want to be 1-up going down 18, because you know, if you hit it in the bunker, there's a good chance it isn't in play.
Q. You just banked 2,000 FedExCup points.
PATRICK REED: That's awesome.
