 Q.  What could it have been?  
PATRICK REED: It could have been low.  You know, No. 1, 2, 3, I hit the ball okay.  I was very -- I wasn't very pleased with how I hit the ball on the back-9.  I hit a couple loose golf shots but my only bogey was actually a really good bogey.   
I wiped off my grip on 11, you know, before I teed off because it's humid out here and so I went through my whole thing that I normally do with my hand and it slipped completely off the club and I literally almost shanked a driver.  This thing went farther right than it did forward.  It went out of bounds and was able to still make bogey.  Made birdie with my other ball.   
I just didn't really hit many great golf shots on the back-9.  I hit okay golf shots.  So, it wasn't like the front-9 where I hit the ball pretty solid, left myself a lot of 15, 18 in putts and I made almost everyone of them.   
So, that's just something I need to do is I need to stop having these great 9 hole rounds.  I've had a lot of 5, 6 -- 4, 5, 6, 7 fine 9 holes and go and shoot 1-under, 1-over on the back.  I need to figure that out.  And stupid 15.  For some reason I play that hole in 15 shots.  I haven't made a birdie yet.  I need to --   
 Q.  You're due for an eagle tomorrow.  
PATRICK REED: That would be nice.  I'll sign up for it right now.   
 Q.  Are you at all wear and tear from last week in Rio and everything, has that caught up with you at all or are you okay?  
PATRICK REED: I'm good.  You know, I feel like I've been pretty -- because the last year I was away from home 37 weeks so I've been pretty good on this year on figuring out how to conserve as much energy as possible throughout weeks because right now I'm on a 7 week run.  This is my 4th and I have three Playoff events so, you know, I feel like last year was a really good learning experience on how to handle all of that.   
So we're just plugging along and I just need to tidy it up.  It's close.  I go through spurts like today, I went through spurts, 9 holes, playing some really solid, pretty good golf and then I go to the back-9 and just started getting a little loose.  I need to get that better and just kind of figure out a way to tighten it up for all 18, not just 9.
