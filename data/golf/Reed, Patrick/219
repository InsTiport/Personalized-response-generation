Q.   Hole-in-one on the 16th hole today.   Walk us through that shot.
PATRICK REED:   Just one of those perfect 5-iron numbers.   Actually hit just a tad right of the flag, and with my little draw just saw it bounce a little left and perfect speed and fell in the middle of the cup.

Q.   After the hole-in-one you and the caddy had a little bit of a race.   Tell us about that as well.   We heard you lost -- was it a bracelet that went in the water?
PATRICK REED:   It did.   Yeah, yesterday he was -- we were last to hit yesterday.   He was kind of behind everybody.   Told him he had to hurry up, because I heard the people cheering for the caddies and now he's a hometown boy.   I had to have him win the race.   Today I thought if I got a little speed on him to catch up, I might be able to take him, but he's just a little too quick.

Q.   How did the knee feel during that?   How did it feel during the round?
PATRICK REED:   The knee felt all right.   It's getting a lot better.   The only thing is sometimes when I load up on that left side, kind of twist that knee into impact, that's when I kind of feel some pain.   But luckily when I'm bending or walking, I don't really feel it too bad.   Hopefully it will be good for tomorrow and even better for the next week.

Q.   That hole-in-one on the 16th hole was on your front-9.   How did that hole-in-one kind of propel you for the rest of the round where you finished with a great score?
PATRICK REED:   Early in the round I was doing a lot of things well.   I seemed to be a little forced.   I had an unforced error on the three putts, two birdies.   Good iron shot on the other par-3.   Really wasn't -- I didn't get anything out of my round.   Kind of jump-started.   Rolled in a couple putts and had another chip-in to top it off.

Q.   Great round, thanks for your time, Patrick.
PATRICK REED:   Yeah.
