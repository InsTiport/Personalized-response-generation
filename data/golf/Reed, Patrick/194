Q. What's your take on the way the week has panned out?
PATRICK REED: Played great.  Going into today, I knew I had to go shoot a low number, and yeah, I had two mud balls, one on 8, kind of hooked it left and missed a short putt.  Then I had a putt on 17, I hit a good iron shot, had one too many clubs.  Thought I hit a good chip and hit a perfect putt that didn't go in.  Unfortunately left the putt short on 18 and unfortunately in the playoff left the bunker shot short which I didn't think was possible.
It is what it is.  Of course we're not happy and not pleased with the result.  But at the end of the day, if you would have told me I would have come over, finish second, I wouldn't have teed it up this week; I would have taken it and left.  It was a solid week and just have to build on it and have to do things just a little bit better to get in the winner's circle.
Q. Essentially so many highlights when you hole that eagle and another birdie.  Anything could have been possible there.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, I mean, it felt like it was almost dÃ©jÃ  vu of Tournament of Champions when I holed out for eagle coming down the stretch.  And then I bogeyed 17 by missing a putt.  Had a putt for birdie on 18 and unfortunately this time didn't make it.  Like I said, it is what it is.  But can't be too disappointed with a second place finish.
Q. Final Series as a whole on The European Tour has been pretty good, hasn't it?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it has.  That's I think five or seven, my last seven events, finished inside the Top-10 five times.  It's a definite improvement.  Obviously it shows the things I'm working on is getting better because last year, it seemed like I started off strong with a win but kind of was flat throughout the rest of the year until this end run.
So we're doing the right things.  Just need to keep on plugging along and hopefully close one out here shortly.
Q. Having played with a man who has won in the end throughout the day, I have to ask your appreciation of how well he's played.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, he's played great.  When he had a loose shot, he knew how to pick it up and save himself.  Then he hit an awesome shot on 14 to make birdie from the left rough.  He made a clutch putt on 17 and I did the same thing on 18.  Both of us had birdie putts to win the golf tournament and left them short.
Just one of those things that I just need to work on and get a little better.  I'm pretty sure he learned a lot coming down the stretch on closing out and finishing strong, especially in the playoff.
