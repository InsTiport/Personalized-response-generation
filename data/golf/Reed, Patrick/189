Q. 12-under sounds pretty good through two days.  What's your take on the way you've played these first two rounds of 2016?
PATRICK REED: I feel like yesterday was a really solid day.  Today, I felt like I didn't quite hit the ball solid like I needed to and because of that, even though I was hitting a lot of greens, I wasn't hitting it as close as yesterday.
So I had some longer putts and unfortunately, today I didn't really roll many in and didn't have any kick-in birdies.  So, but, any time you can be 12-under through two rounds, within shouting distance of the lead, you have to take it and just go on to tomorrow.
Q. You're chasing Jordan Spieth going into this weekend, you've seen him the first two days, you know you how well he's playing.  What's it going to take to run him down the next two days?
PATRICK REED: Just have to play like I did the first day.  Get some close, make a couple kick-in birdies and then make some, one or two mid-range putts.
Just seemed like today I didn't have any kick-ins.  The birdies I had seemed to be some lengthy putts I had on the back.  So if I can just have some of those lengthy putts go in and make some short birdie putts, that's all can I ask for.
Q. Off to a slow start but then you got it going on the back nine.
PATRICK REED: Yeah, kind of the same way I started yesterday.  Didn't really do much early and yesterday, I turned in 2-under.  Today, unfortunately I turned in 1.
And then today I just need to hit the ball a little more solid like I did yesterday.  Because of that I wasn't able to hit it close.  And, but, luckily I made a couple mid-range putts that I didn't make yesterday.  Just need to keep hitting fairways and greens and hole more putts.
Q. How difficult are these greens?
PATRICK REED: They can be challenging.  Today they seemed really slow.  Jordan and I early had a hard time getting the ball to the hole.  But once you got that down and adapted, after the first three, you think after you leave the first three short you might have to hit the ball a little harder.  Unfortunately I didn't get it in my head and unfortunately I kind of used in with 4-under.  I'm playing well, I just need to go out and play aggressive and have a good weekend.
