Q.   Talk about how your round is going so far.   Ended on a bad note but you had it going there?
PATRICK REED:   Not really.   Just a loose tee shot, which I've hit a lot of those today, and I've been scrambling and scrambling.   I happened not to get one there, but got a lot of holes left and I'm only one back.

Q.   You have to be happy with where you are and a lot of golf still tomorrow?
PATRICK REED:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   Any time you have a chance to win the tournament, it's always good. 

Q.   Obviously the mental part of this is probably the stopping and starting; how do you just keep yourself focused? 
PATRICK REED:   Pretty easy to do.   Just going to start fresh tomorrow and act like tomorrow is just a tournament.   That's what it comes down to.
