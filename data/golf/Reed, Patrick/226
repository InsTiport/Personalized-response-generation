 Q.   Talk with your round, quick start.   
PATRICK REED:   Pretty poor round, honestly.   Yeah, I got off to a fast start but No. 10 is playing straight downwind; 12 is playing straight downwind.   And I had a tapâ€‘in on 11, but besides that, I didn't hit the ball particularly well.   Didn't really make many putts after my quick start.   This was pretty ugly.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the difficulty of the course and how it's changed from last year?  
PATRICK REED:   Hasn't really changed.   If anything, the greens are maybe a tad softer.   But besides that, it's still playing firm, fast and the wind is still up.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people had problems on 18, a lot of balls in the water.   Still playing as one of the toughest holes on tour?  
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, the fairway is five yards wide and it's blowing 30 into the wind.   If you hit the fairway, you almost missed it left to get it in that fairway.   So yeah, it's always going to be a tough hole.   It's almost like a par 5 you're playing it as, and if you happen to make four, then good for you.
