 Q.   How did it feel?  
PATRICK REED:   It felt good.   I didn't really do much.   I didn't really do anything well today.   I kind of struggled.   I didn't have that big mess I had three times yesterday, which is always good.  
I left myself in the wrong spots on a lot of the holes.   And besides that, with not making the putts I should have made that I made yesterday and then with holing my bunker shot at the end felt good to end a round like that.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your imagination on that bunker shot?  
PATRICK REED:   I have seen it happen about 50 times throughout the years of watching it, watching everyone on that front left flag, everyone seems to go right on the bunker shot.   And I was like, might as well try it.   Nothing to really lose.   I knew if I went at the flag there was no chance of stopping it.   And I knew if I went right I had a chance of hopefully getting it.   I was thinking 6 to 10 feet would have been great.   To check up like it did, from my angle from the center of the cup, and I saw Keegan raise his hand a little bit I knew it was in.  
   
 Q.   How close to the hole did you think you could land it?  
PATRICK REED:   If it went three feet farther, it probably stays up on top.   It had enough spin to kind of grab and hold it from going up top on the top ridge.   It had to be a good 30 feet right, 40 feet right of the hole.  
   
 Q.   The game plan tomorrow, just talk about that.   
PATRICK REED:   You know, continue hitting the driver the way I did today.   I felt like it didn't get me in too much trouble.   And basically drive it like I did today, hit the iron shots like I did yesterday and putt like I did yesterday and I should be okay.   
   
 Q.   How about your friend Jordan out there?  
PATRICK REED:   I don't know.   Feels like he's playing a different golf course at the moment.   But people are only halfway through, and hopefully we can go out and put a little bit of pressure on him.   I don't think anybody is really doing that yet.   
All I can control is my golfball and trying to play some good golf and try to shoot some low numbers.  
   
 Q.   How tough is he when he has the lead, though?  
PATRICK REED:   He's pretty tough.   I think anyone is tough when they have the lead, because it means you just have to play not only better than them, but you have to play a certain amount of shots better than them.   And he's at 14, so I'm 12 back.   I put my foot down and hopefully have two Mondays.  
   
 Q.   Does that make you change anything being 12 strokes back?  
PATRICK REED:   No.   I mean with being 12 shots back, I can only go out and try to play some good golf, try to shoot a couple rounds in the 60s, maybe get hot one day and shoot a low 60 number and have a chance.   
But at the same time we're going to need some help from him.   He's 14‑under par for two days.   If he's going to go out and shoot, 2‑, 3‑, 4‑under each day, that means he's going to be at the end of the week 20?   If she's 20‑under par, I mean, I have to go shoot 9, 9 just to tie.   We're going to need a little bit of help.   
At the end of the day all I can do is control what I do and play some good golf.
