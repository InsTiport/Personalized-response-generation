Q.   What do you take away from the opening round?
PATRICK REED:   Need to make putts.   You know, my 3-wood was awful today.   I hit every single one of them right.   Because of that -- and usually you're pulling out 3-wood instead of a driver to get it in play.   Unfortunately, I was hitting it in the rough the whole entire time with that club.   I hear they have rough the perfect length.   You catch the flyer, you have to kind of assess the line.   Unfortunately, I didn't do that very well and I didn't make a single putt so I'm over-par.

Q.   Are you worried at all about missing the cut or does that not enter your mind?
PATRICK REED:   It doesn't enter my mind.   If I go out and play good golf tomorrow I don't have to worry about it.

Q.   Patrick, playing in your first Ryder Cup this year and Tiger announcing he took his name out, were you surprised at all about by that announcing it three weeks prior to the selection?
PATRICK REED:   Tiger did because his health is most important.   You know, all of us wish him the best and hope he gets back quickly because without him it's a different game.
