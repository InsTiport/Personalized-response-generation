Q. How rewarding is this victory?
PATRICK REED: It's very rewarding. You know, my team and I, we've worked so hard through the end of last year and also at the beginning of this year, and kept on feeling like we were playing some good golf, just we weren't quite able to get over that hump. To come back and win my second World Golf Championship, especially with how I had to finish from basically 15 onwards, last hole was ugly but it was what I needed just to get the job done. At the end of the day, just putting yourself in these positions on Sunday is just unbelievable. It's a great feeling, and I can't wait to go home and celebrate with the little ones and my wife and bring home a trophy.
