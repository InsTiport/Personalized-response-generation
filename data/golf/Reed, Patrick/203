Q. They got off to a fast start but after that it was a really competitive match.  How do you think it went?
PATRICK REED: It was a battle.  We played I felt pretty solid, but unfortunately we dug ourselves a little bit of a hole.  And they capitalized on a couple putts and a couple wedge shots that they hit really close to kind of close us out.
Q. With a do you think the key is to their success?  They are 3-0 as a team.
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, they definitely play well together.  They have played a lot of golf together.  Patrick and I, we definitely didn't play bad by any means.  We didn't make a bogey out there I think.
PATRICK REED: I missed a two-and-a-half footer --
RICKIE FOWLER: We don't count that.
We played solid.  We just didn't make as many birdies as we should have.  I needed to make some putts and wasn't able to do that, so that's where they got us.  They definitely, like Patrick said, capitalized on some birdie opportunities, and they got off to that quick start, which meant it was tough to catch them without making any birdies from there.
Q. Now you're playing this afternoon.  Are you excited to be playing with Jordan again?
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it will be fun.  Hopefully we can go out and get some momentum going and turn this thing back up to red.  There's a lot of blue on that board and hopefully we can turn it around.
