Q. First question has to be:  How are you after a flight from the other side of the world?
PATRICK REED: I'm tired.  Yeah, I'm running on fumes today, which was expected.  Not being a good sleeper on flights and planes as it is, coming in, I knew it was going to be rough.  Getting in today, I knew it was going to be rough on my body.  But the great thing is, every time I've flown from the U.S., out somewhere, it hasn't been bad because you always land in the morning.  So you kind of have that whole day, you stay up for 30-something hours.  I'll go to bed really early tonight and sleep through the night, so I'll be refreshed by tomorrow.
You know, that's important for me.  It's just one of those things that -- it's one of those little obstacles that I have to go and face.  The more I can do that, the better it's going to be.
I've had a lot of different learning curves with playing on The European Tour, and playing on the PGA TOUR, that have helped me grow as a golfer.  This is just one of them that I'm just going to have to get used to.
Q. And you land somewhere where you have some affection for the place, given the fine performance at Fanling last time around.  Does that make it worthwhile?
PATRICK REED: It does.  But the main thing for us is, I've heard a lot of great things about Hong Kong.  I haven't actually, before last year, I haven't actually visited the place.  To be able to come and play in an event and to come over and just see how awesome a place it is, down from the food, the shopping, the people, the golf course.
The golf course is one of the best short golf courses I've ever played.  It's not long at all.  It's short.  It's really narrow.  It gives you all different kinds of shots you need to hit.  It really tests your game in a lot of different ways, and a lot of different unique ways, rather than other golf courses.  It's a fun place.  I'm so excited to be back and hopefully put on a good show this week.
Q. As a player who loves to be aggressive around any golf course, do you have to rein is in just a little?
PATRICK REED: I do.  It cost me a tournament last year.  There's a lot of errors I had last year on -- you're always going to have errors on making a bad golf swing at some point throughout a tournament.  Those are going to happen.
The biggest difference is you can't make the careless errors.   There's a lot of times last year where being the aggressive nature that I am in golf, I went for a lot of things I shouldn't have and it cost a lot of bogeys for me.  It was definitely the difference of being -- winning the tournament and finishing third.
So this year's go around, I'm not going to be as aggressive off the tees, but we're still going to be really aggressive with those irons on the greens.
Q. Does that experience help; once bitten, twice shy?
PATRICK REED: It does for sure.  That's just those things, that you have to learn from those things.  You can't have them continue and keep on happening and reoccurring.  So we're about to find out how well I learned when I tee it up on Thursday.
