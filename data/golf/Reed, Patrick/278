 Q.   Patrick, it was a little, probably wasn't as easy as it didn't look out there?  
PATRICK REED:   No, it was tough out there.   But at the same time, I mean, the fan group and the support I had behind me with Callaway, all they did for me, especially this week with getting me a driver and a 3â€‘wood that I really liked.   And that new Alpha, it's something special, it goes a long way and I normally can control it.   Unfortunately today not too much, but the other three days.   
When I started hitting the ball in play and not getting in fairway bunkers, it actually wasn't that difficult.   I started towards the end playing for par, just because I knew pars weren't going to hurt me.   Especially with, I think I had a five shot lead or four shot lead going into the back nine.   I knew someone was going to have to do something spectacular to catch me.   And the good thing is the guy who was right behind me was playing with me.   
So it wasn't pretty, but it was a lot less stressful than I thought.   
   
 Q.   Spectacular three days in a row will usually beat a spectacular one day?  
PATRICK REED:   Oh, exactly.   The way we played earlier this week, with the three 63s, those actually didn't feel, they didn't feel amazing, they felt like good rounds, but to come out and not have my full game and to have that much of a cushion to be able to just coast in, that's a good feeling.   
   
 Q.   Rory McIlroy, Harris English, and you, the only three players on the PGA TOUR with multiple wins.   Pretty impressive.   
PATRICK REED:   I appreciate it.   Thank you.
