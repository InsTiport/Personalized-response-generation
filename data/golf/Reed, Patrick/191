 Q.  Tough day out there from start to finish.  
PATRICK REED: I felt like I hit the ball a lot more solid today than yesterday.  I hit it more like the first round.  But with how the wind was blowing today, you had to hit the ball solid.  Because you needed to get some penetration through the wind.  And I feel like I did that well.  I made a couple putts out there.  I left a few out there.  But all in all to shoot bogey-free for 54 holes, I haven't done that before, so that's always nice.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you about that, you've never done that before for three rounds, no bogeys out here?  
PATRICK REED: I don't think so.  I think that's the first.  So, that's always a positive and making a good bit of birdie but just obviously need to make a little bit more to try to catch Jordan.  But it's just one of those days I need to keep it going.   
 Q.  Tomorrow is going to be a shoot-out.  You know you got to go out there and put the gas pedal down and right from the get-go, right?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, yeah, for sure.  I just saw him hit his shot on 18 so he hit it pretty close.  So, like Rickie said, we have to make it rain, because Jordan's definitely not letting up and we're going to have to go out and get it.   
 Q.  Are you excited about tomorrow though looking forward to it?  
PATRICK REED: For sure.  Any time you get to play in this wonderful weather it's always nice and any time you get to play in a tournament where it's the champions only, it's always nice as well.
