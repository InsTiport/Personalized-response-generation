  JORDAN SPIETH: Same thing.  We made -- we fed off each other nicely, very rarely birdied the same hole. It took us a little longer to get started.  We were 2-down early.  We stayed positive.  We knew we had plenty of holes left, then we kind of started making birdies back and forth.  From there, the momentum was on our side and this guy is pretty good at closing it out.   Q.  Patrick, you guys won your match yesterday morning 5&4 and and then sat out.  I know it was disappointing for you guys to not play in the afternoon to contribute to the American side.  How were you able to put that aside and go out there this morning and concentrate?  PATRICK REED: That part is very easy.  We're here to do one thing, and that's to play for Tom Watson and the United States and try to get as many points as possible. Whenever we're asked to play, all they ask is us go out and grind and try to get our points.  So far we're 2-0 and hopefully we can continue.   Q.  What are your thoughts on playing together this afternoon?  JORDAN SPIETH: Like it.  I like the foursomes there.  That's probably my favourite style of golf.  This will be a new thing for Patrick and I, but we practised earlier in the week with it and played well.
