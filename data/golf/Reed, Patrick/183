 Q.  What makes you so tough in this format?  
PATRICK REED: I don't know.  Just kind of one of those things that every time I play in these kind of matches, I just relish and love it.  It just brings out the best in me.   
Phil and I didn't get off to a great start early.  I turned things around, started hitting the ball really solid, started making some putts and put some pressure on him.   
He hung in there.  I was 7-up through 10.  He won 11.  Made a great putt on 12.  Birdied 13.  I had a good putt to make here on 14.  It went a little longer than I wanted to, but at the end of the day a win is a win.   
 Q.  You talked about being 7-up through 10, how would you explain how difficult it is to close out one of these matches?  
PATRICK REED: It's not easy because when you get into that kind of a lead, the guy you are playing against all of a sudden goes very aggressive, starts hitting driver on holes that he might not hit driver on.  Starts going dead at the flags.  Guys out here are all so good, that one shot could turn things around.  They go from struggling to hitting the ball solid.  Next thing you know, they are having a lot of kick-ins for birdies.  So the main thing is once you get that big lead, you have to keep your pedal down and still have to play aggressive and go out and attack it.   
 Q.  You played well today.  Two eagles.  Really sensational day.  
PATRICK REED: Phil and I kind of struggled early.  I was able to win the first two holes with pars.  After I got through that stretch, started hitting the ball a little better.  The eagle on 6, especially with knowing how well of a chipper he is, I figured if I lagged it up and had a tap-in, he had a good chance of chipping in because I've seen him do it so many times.  Being able to hole that eagle on 6.  He hit a great wedge shot on 10, which could have built some momentum for him.  Just holing the wedge shot from there definitely kept me in the driver's seat.  Just kind of one of those things that keep the pedal down and next time hope to close it off on 12 or 13, not 14.   
 Q.  How much confidence do you have going to the weekend now?  It looks like your game is at a high level.  
PATRICK REED: I'm playing well.  Couple of things that I still need to work on.  My 3-wood just doesn't seem to be turning over on me a little bit.  Besides that I feel like I'm in control.  I just need to continue to get some good shots, make good putts and keeping pressure on guys.   
 Q.  You're one heck of a match play guy.  The more I watch you, the more I think this is your game, man.  
PATRICK REED: I love it.  I love match play.  I relish every time I get to go in this format and go up against one guy.  It's something that I love and something I'm pretty good at.  Just going out and getting in a dog fight..
