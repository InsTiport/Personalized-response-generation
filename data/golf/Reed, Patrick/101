 Q.  Five birdies, an eagle, a bunch of other things as well.  That's quite a ride out there for you today.  How was it?  
PATRICK REED: Frustrating, honestly.  I didn't feel like I hit the ball as well as I did yesterday and really didn't feel like I hit it as well as I did over the past like two weeks.  But it was tough out there.  It just seemed like the ball would either bounce and go towards the hole or it would hit in a good spot and end up kind of going in the wrong direction.  But I hung in there, I felt like it was just kind of one of those days that it could have been a really low day, but it was just kind of one of those things where I just had too many stupid errors.  One bad swing, but really just a lot of stupid errors rather than poor golf swings.   
 Q.  I think one of the best highlights had to be the eagle at 12.  Tell us about that one.  
PATRICK REED: Yeah, kind of where the wind direction was, I didn't feel comfortable with drawing that tee shot, so I went to my nemesis cut.  And I hit a perfect tee shot there and I was actually hit it too good where I was in between a 3-iron number and a kind of a cut 3-wood.  And I knew long there was dead, so I was like just hit a really hard 3-iron and try to chase it between the bunkers and hopefully get on the front of the green.  I just hit it absolutely perfect.  It happened to fly a yard short right up the gap.  And from there it was just, really, a double breaking putt, uphill then downhill at the end, I'm just sitting there just thinking give it a chance, but just try and get good speed and get it close, tap in birdie, and it just happened to be a perfect birdie right in the heart.
