 Q.  Your 65, you're at the top of the leaderboard, how good do you feel about how things went out there today?  
PATRICK REED: It went well.  Really, I felt like the driver wasn't as solid as it was yesterday.  Still feel like I missed some golf shots there.  I had a couple three big lip-out putts, but besides that really the biggest difference between today and yesterday was yesterday I seemed to hit the ball maybe a fraction closer all day, but I was on the wrong side of the hole.  I was always above it or just on one side of the ridge where I had to go up and over.  So you're having to putt defensive.   
Today it seemed like I left myself below the hole, so I was able to be aggressive going up towards the hole.  That's key around here.  Really making putts.  I had 23 today, and I think it was like 31 or 32 yesterday.  Really, the difference in yesterday and today, I didn't feel like I hit a poor putt yet until one putt today on hole 5, which I kind of hammered through the break.  But besides that, I feel like I'm hitting my lines.  You just have to leave yourself below the hole.   
 Q.  Do you think there's something about this course and these conditions that's helping to create such a crowded leaderboard toward the top with so many guys in it?  
PATRICK REED: I think the biggest thing is you have generous fairways, but at the same time, it's a really long golf course.  So, you know, you don't have a ton of wedges.  And because of that, you're not seeing anyone go out and just shoot 18, 19, 20 under for the whole week because it's a big golf course.  It's soft with all the rain, so I think today I still had -- I mean, I had three or four -- one 5-iron, two 4-irons, and a 2-iron into par 4s.  That's just because it's playing soft.   
With the golf course like this and how wide the fairways are, they have to play them that length.  So, it's just kind of one of those that even with a pretty decent shot with those, you could still end up in a bad spot.   
 Q.  How does a U.S. Open compare to Ryder Cup pressure?  
PATRICK REED: I really haven't had much U.S. Open pressure considering how I teed off at 10:49, and the leaders might be through 4.  But to me it's going to basically all be kind of the same.  Just go out there and play my game plan, stick to my -- stick to what I know how to do and just go play some golf.   
If I continue playing well and make some putts here and there, hopefully late tomorrow with a couple of stretches coming down, we have a chance to win a golf tournament.   
 Q.  You expressed a great deal of Patriotism in Rio.  Obviously you're playing for your country, and it's different in the Olympics.  But this is the U.S. Open.  You're an American.  Do you feel something particularly special about this major championship?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  I mean, it's where we're from.  It's home.  To go out and just play well tomorrow and have a chance to win the golf tournament would mean a lot.  I kind of do what I need to do today, shoot a low number, get myself back in this golf tournament.  I was thinking if you can get 4 or 5-under par today, it would be a pretty good score to get yourself in the golf tournament.  Go out and shoot 7 and exceed where my goal was, that's always a positive.  It just kind of builds up momentum and carries it over for tomorrow.
