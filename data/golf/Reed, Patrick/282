 Q.   Back to back 63s.   Often hard to back up another good round after the first one.   Talk about today.   
PATRICK REED:   I felt I had little more confidence in my driver today.   I was hitting my tee shots a lot better, compared to yesterday.   At least in the beginning.   And it was a 63 today, but I felt like I left a couple shots out there.   
With that bogey I made on the second hole to start the day, I hit a great drive, felt like I hit a great pitching wedge, it landed, I would say a yard short of being on the front edge, and if it does that it's five feet, instead it ends up five feet off the green.   
Unfortunately, I missed a 4‑footer, but I didn't let anything phase me.   After that I just continued hitting good golf shots and letting my putter do work and it happened to work again.   
Tomorrow we're going to go with the same game plan, try to hit some fairways, hit some greens, and see what the putter can do.   It seems to be working right now.   So why stop?   
   
 Q.   You missed the cut here last year, what do you think the difference is?  
PATRICK REED:   I'm a totally different golfer than last year at this time.   I have Callaway equipment now, the equipment's been amazing.   Absolutely I love the new equipment, and it worked all‑‑ halfway through last year and it worked so far this year, so it just builds confidence.   And I've been working really hard with my swing coach, Kevin Kirk.   Him and I have been working really hard, and then also with shotstohole.com, Stuart Leong, the guy we have been working with, my swing coach to fine tuning out what needs to be worked on, and so I can actually take my practices and be more productive with them.   With my group, my team that we worked with all off season, it's showing, it's showing the improvements that we have made.   
   
 Q.   A couple years ago you were famous for Monday qualifying, do you think that kind of mentality, going low, kind of just put the gas pedal down to get into a tournament helps you in a tournament like this?  
PATRICK REED:   For sure.   It's a birdiefest, this tournament is.   It's always that way.   
It's pretty easy to get in that Monday qualifying mindset, due to the fact that you're playing three different courses.   So the first day it's like, all right, well, let's see how we do against the guys in my course there, try to go beat them.   And the same thing every day.   
If you do that, if you lead your wave or your first to third in your wave on the course that you're playing each day, at the end of the day, coming down Sunday, you're going to have a chance to win.   
   
 Q.   Talk about like 18‑under through two rounds, only a couple shots ahead, is that intimidating or what do you feel you have to do for the weekend going forward?  
PATRICK REED:   I just got to keep playing how I'm playing.   I can't control how the other guys play.   There's going to be guys out there that are going to go shoot 10, 12‑under par in one round.   At the same time, I can only control what I do, and that's all that matters.   As long as I feel like I'm improving from where I was last week to this week, to where I was yesterday to today, then, I mean, hey, that's all that really matters to me.   
   
 Q.   Sitting at 18 under after two rounds of consecutive 9‑under.   What was the key to today's round?  
PATRICK REED:   Same thing as yesterday.   Hit the greens and give myself chances.   It seemed like if I got myself within 20 feet, that I had a really good chance of the ball going in or hit the edge of the hole.   
I just stuck to that game plan.   I didn't get ahead of myself, which is key out here.   Because if you start getting ahead of yourself saying I need to birdie this hole or that hole coming up, then the hole you're on, you're going to lose a little focus.   And especially on a golf course like this where you're shooting 9‑under just to keep pace, you know, it's one of those things that you have to stay focused.
