Q. You haven't won since the Hyundai Tournament of Champions 2015 and with this, you move to No. 1 FedExCup points and qualify for The Ryder Cup in the same week.  How does that make you feel?
PATRICK REED: That's awesome.  I worked pretty hard with my coach this past couple weeks, and the game obviously shows that I'm moving in the right direction.  But there are some things we need to work on -- I started going back to my old pattern.
But to finish off on the last, it's just amazing.  I wouldn't be able to do it without my team and with all of them, my wife out here trekking around this place, Callaway fine-tuning that driver this week, it's just been great to finally be able to close one off.
Q. Your first win this season, you've been so close.  How does that feel?
PATRICK REED: It feels amazing.  I haven't had that feeling in a while coming down the last couple.  With having a lead, I felt like I did a lot of things well.  Unfortunately I didn't quite make the scores I wanted to down the last but it was enough to get the job done.
Q. Sometimes it's nice to win ugly; doesn't matter, does it, but projected No. 1 in the FedEx, and now, you're cemented for The Ryder Cup.  What about that?
PATRICK REED: Good.  I'm so glad.  It was a huge goal of ours to get back because in our first Ryder Cup, we played so well and unfortunately the Cup didn't come back with us.  It's sweet revenge and hopefully our team gets fired up and go out and keep that Cup home.
