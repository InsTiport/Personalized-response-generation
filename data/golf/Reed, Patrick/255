 Q.  How do you sum up your round today?  PATRICK REED: I think it was a good round.  Anytime you shoot under par, especially at the start of the week.  I definitely have some things I'm going to work on.  My driving definitely let me down today.  I didn't hit the tee shot well at all.  Everyone was left and I wasn't starting off, it was just big hooks.  It cost me on 5.  Luckily I made bogey because I holed a chip. Those are things that you can't do.  And I felt like I'm finally getting my putting around.  I'm playing pretty well.  I hit my irons pretty solid.  Just figure out that drive and I should be good to go.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  PATRICK REED: No, I mean I still missed -- that chip in of course saved a shot or two.  I still missed a couple of putts I should have made.  But at the same time I feel like I could have made a couple more that I should have.  And I made a couple I should have.  I missed a couple that I should have made, as well.   Q.  You guys feeding off each other, the three of you?  PATRICK REED: Yeah, I don't know if we were really feeding off each other.  We were all just kind of in our own zone and doing our own things.  I was making birdies from trees, from some fairways.  Spieth was making some from fairways and from other areas, as well.  Jason Day who started out -- started out pretty poorly on ball-striking, but he was doing what he had to do to make pars and salvage the beginning of the round to keep his momentum.  We all kind of had our ups and downs.  But at the end of the day it's good to see all three of us on the board.   Q.  Do you get much of a chance to play with Jordan?  PATRICK REED: Yeah, I play with him all the time.  I played with him last week.  I played with him before.  And also I played with him before we turned pro, in a lot of amateur events.  It's been great playing with him especially, a good friend of mine.  And then also to have something in common about the Ryder Cup.  We were talking about it a little bit today, how excited we are to go over there and play well.   Q.  How much is is that on your mind?  Is it tough because it's such a huge event, is it tough to focus on the present sometimes?  PATRICK REED: Yeah, during the wait it is.  When you're moving around playing golf, and if your group is at a steady pace, you're really focusing on what you're doing.  That's why we're at where we are now, because we're really able to focus on what we're doing that moment, rather than thinking ahead or thinking behind us.   Q.  But in the waiting moments, it kind of creeps in the head?  PATRICK REED: During waiting moments right now, we'll say something about it here and there.  It's always nice to joke around about stuff with the guys.  It kind of keeps you loose and helps the time pass a little quicker.   Q.  Do you look at Jordan as someone you would prefer to play with at Gleneagles?  PATRICK REED: I'd love to play with any of them.  All of them are playing well.  I'd love to play with any of the guys.  It's just one of those things that whoever Captain Watson has in store for all of us.
