PATRICK REED: If I can go out there and shoot a low to mid-60s, it's always a good round.  But I have a lot of work to do, especially with these guys coming in, I'm pretty sure they will make a couple birdies and get down the lead a little lower.   
But for me the main thing is stay patient and aggressive, but figure out the par 5s.  Even with shooting 8-under today, I didn't birdie a single par 5.  I played them at even par and I'm only 1-under par this week for the par 5s total.  I need to figure them out and I need to get that going.  But the game felt really good today.   
I finally feel like I was hitting the ball solid.  The first two days I didn't feel like I was hitting it very well.  Any time I get a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more confidence in the ball-striking, makes the putting a lot easier.   
 Q.  Is this down to work on the range or better weather conditions for you compared to a modest first couple of days?  
PATRICK REED: I think it's more on just staying rested and just kind of rejuvenating, because the main thing is, this is my fourth week in a row, and especially with all of them being overseas and traveling.  So just something I need to get used to and just keep on get something good night sleeps and wake up and start fresh.   
 Q.  Did it kind of help that you've got a hotel right here on course and you don't have to do too much traveling?  
PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure, it does.  Any time you can stay really close, it makes life a lot easier.  Just gives that you extra ten, 15 minutes to get to sleep.  Any time you can have a little extra Zs, it's always better.   
 Q.  I take it you fed off Henrik Stenson, the two of you both going nicely.  
PATRICK REED: For sure.  One of those things that we kept on trading off birdies, whether we topped each other:  He would birdie one and I would birdie the next and then he would birdie the next.  If we play with each other tomorrow, hopefully we can do the same thing, get a run and hopefully have a chance later in the round.   
 Q.  You've touched on this, because it does depend on what the others do, but what do you fancy is necessary come Sunday?  
PATRICK REED: Kind of all depends on how the weather -- a day like today where even though the wind was up, it was a little warmer, I would think I would have to go shoot probably around close to the same number I just did to have a chance to win.  But it all depends on what these guys behind us do and it all depends on how they set up the golf course tomorrow.
