Q. You've been working very, very hard on your ball-striking.  How would you compare today's performance to yesterday?
PATRICK REED: Completely different.  Today I didn't quite hit it as well as yesterday.  Seems like yesterday when I hit it really solid, it was really close to the hole.  Today it felt like when I hit it really solid, it was that 15- to 18-foot range.
Pins were a little tougher.  It was harder to get the ball as close as I wanted.  The main thing is, I mean, 14 greens yesterday, ten greens today, and then the big factor is the fairways.  I didn't hit as many fairways today unlike yesterday.
It seemed like today on some of the holes when I missed the fairway, I missed in the wrong spots where I was completely dead, couldn't get it to the green and had to scramble for 60 or 80 yards and put myself in a spot.  Where if you hit the fairway, you have a chance of getting it really close to the green instead of laying up to a narrow fairway and knocked it in the water.
There were a couple mental mistakes that I needed to clean up but all in all it was pretty close.  It wasn't too far off.  I just need that putter to continue working.  I missed too many putts today.
Q. Only three back heading into the weekend.  Still a lot of golf to play but in contention, what mentality do you bring to Saturday and Sunday?
PATRICK REED: Just continue to do what I'm doing.  You know, I'll go back and do some drills in the room.  Might go out and hit a couple balls here when I get done with this.  Really just reset the patterns and get back to how I was hitting the ball yesterday and how I was hitting it a couple days before.  You know, it's there.  Working so hard to get in the correct position; that feels a little uncomfortable.  There's going to be days when you revert back to the old habits.  I just need to put in a lot of reps and groove it.
