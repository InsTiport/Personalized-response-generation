MATT KUCHAR: I feel bad letting Patrick down, great track record in these events, and unfortunately I let him down.  Louis and Branden played some nice golf.  They were good.
We got off to a good start and kind of had a good match going there midway through, and then yeah, we kind of hit some loose shots.  Feel like I didn't really pull my weight today.  They got a lead and we were just struggling.
Q. You know it's a team game --
MATT KUCHAR: Hey, you never like being the guy that hits the bad shot.  It's hard in alternate-shot.  It's one thing in best-ball; in alternate-shot.
PATRICK REED: It's a little more pressure on you, a little more desire and you feel like you let your partner down when you put him in lousy spots.
Q. Overall thoughts, pairing with Kuch today, what worked and what didn't out there?
PATRICK REED: A lot didn't work.  We're a great team.  You know, we just unfortunately, we had a couple loose iron shots, a couple loose putts.  And when you're playing guys like Oosthuizen and Grace, they hit the ball so well, you have to hit fairways and you have to hit greens.  Unfortunately we got down too much and we couldn't fight back.
