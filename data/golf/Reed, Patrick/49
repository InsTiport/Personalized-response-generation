PATRICK REED: It's amazing, just to be back and to feel like I've been playing some solid golf and finally having it pay off and to come out as a victory, it's been a while.  Been a little too long honestly but what better place to do it than here.  Have Statue of Liberty in the background, Presidents Cup here in 2017 and hearing Captain America and USA all week, it was a good time to get a W.
Q. Moving to second in the FedExCup standings.  You lock up your spot in THE TOUR Championship.  What does this do for you now that you have the security with two more playoff legs to go?
PATRICK REED: Really, it's just the beginning.  It's the first Playoff event.  So you know, the good thing was I felt like I've been playing well all year.  To come out and get the W this week and climb up the board quickly and get up to second, now just go out, rest up tomorrow and start playing aggressive again and try to get up there as high as I can going into East Lake.
Q. Sometimes athletes can find the tri-state area a little daunting with these fans.  You thrive on it, your second time winning THE NORTHERN TRUST.  What is it about this environment that you always seem to come out with your best?
PATRICK REED: Statue of Liberty right there and we have awesome people.  The people are great.  They have just been amazing autumn week.  From the day I got here until the final putt went in, it was unbelievable to be back.
Q. How much did you pull from the Presidents Cup, teeing this golf course and knowing what you guys did as a team to win here that you could apply to today?
PATRICK REED: I pulled a lot.  I think the biggest thing was, you know, especially coming down towards the end, knowing that birdies are out here, people are going to be able to make birdies and so you're going to have to go out and finish it off and make some birdies coming in.
