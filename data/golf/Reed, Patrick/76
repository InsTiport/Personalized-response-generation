PATRICK REED: Just one of those days, a little frustrating on the greens and a couple 4-iron shots.  But you know, you have to hit fairways around this place.  I went 14 for 14, first time ever doing that.  If I continue doing that, I can attack this golf course.   
 Q.  You had not a fairway, but a green with a driver at the 12th hole?  
PATRICK REED: Normally I want to hit a cut up there, but after seeing Tony go ahead and hit driver, seemed like he hit a good cut, sitting there going, all right.  Well, I'm actually hitting my draw and I can go ahead and hit it hard and I was able to kind of start it on the right side and hit it hard and was lucky enough to hit it on the right spot end and up on the green.  Nothing like lagging a 12-foot eagle putt.   
 Q.  You'll get the morning tee time and the greens will be better.  Do you think you can play the ball down on Friday?  
PATRICK REED: It's going to be hard to tell.  I would say 14, 16 and 17, that ball was just caked in mud on the fairway.  So that's -- end of the day, back nine, so we're going to have to see.  It depends on how fast this place dries out, whether they are playing up-and-down, go hit it, find it and play it again.
