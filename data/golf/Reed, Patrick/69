Q. Tough match to be one of their hottest players today.  How did you play, and how did the match feel from your view?
PATRICK REED: Really, it felt good.  I went out there, and as a team, as a whole, I thought we set out pretty good pairings and match-ups that we might be able to come back from it.  I played some real solid golf.  I missed only I think like two or three fairways and was bogey-free and made five or six birdies.  And you've got to play like that especially in your singles match to go out and close it out because you have no one to help you and it's not in that kind of format.
Q. You had a good give-and-take all week with the crowd.  Could you reflect on the three days of competition here for you?
PATRICK REED: The fans were a lot of fun.  They were brutal when they needed to be, and they were respectful and nice when they were supposed to be.  Coming back over here, I expected to be shushed the whole time, from the starting event to the end, because of what I did in '14.  It was one of those things that the fans were electric and they pulled their team through.
