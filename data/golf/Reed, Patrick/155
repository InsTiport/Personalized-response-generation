 Q.  How much is Ryder Cup on your mind?  
PATRICK REED: Of course it's on my mind.  But really at the end the day, it's just trying to get better and play this tournament.  Because if I play well that means those other guys are going to have to play even better to try to catch me.  Because if I go out and do what I've been doing all year, give myself a chance to win a golf tournament, if I can close one off, then it doesn't matter.  It takes care of itself.   
 Q.  How would you describe your first day?  
PATRICK REED: Better.  It was a clean day.  I feel like I hit the ball pretty solid.  I hit, really, two tee shots I felt that weren't very solid.  I got away with one on 9 today by hitting it into the bush and getting it up-and-down.   
Besides that, all the shots I hit, even though might not have been down some of the lines I wanted to, I was still in the fairway and still on the greens, so I was still able to attack.   
 Q.  Did the Olympic experience feed into your play today in terms of keeping busy and playing in a high-level competition?  
PATRICK REED: You know what, I've always stayed busy.  Last year I was away from home 37 weeks and this year it's going to be 36 weeks.  So staying busy is definitely something I've always done.  That never really changed.   
The main thing is just to stay focused on getting better at golf, not worrying about everything else that's going on, as in Ryder Cup, FedExCup, all those kinds of things.  Really at the end of the day, if I take care of playing some good golf and doing what I need to do, those will all take care of themselves.   
 Q.  Seems like guys are working overtime because of the impending Ryder Cup; Rickie implied that.  You're in a better position, but do you sense that from guys that they are pushing at this time of year?  
PATRICK REED: I mean, yeah, I can see that from other guys.  For me, I'm actually cutting back.  I'm one week less than last year.   
But I've played a ton, and it's just something that I've always loved to do.  But you can definitely see with some of the other guys wanting to play some more and it just shows how much Ryder Cup means to everybody.  It's one of those things that all of us want to make the team, all of us want to get there.   
For me, my schedule never changed because these are the events I was going to play no matter what.   
 Q.  Can you describe what it is that makes it such a draw for all of you, The Ryder Cup?  
PATRICK REED: It's the Ryder Cup.  I mean, you only have two team events every two years and both of them, all the guys are trying to make them to play in.  I know for me this year, it's about getting sweet revenge.  Because my first one was down at Gleneagles, and I played some great golf, but at the end of the day, our team didn't win.  So for us, it's sweet revenge, go back out and keep that Cup here in the States.   
 Q.  Did the course play like you expected it to from your practice rounds?  
PATRICK REED: Yeah.  The first time I ever played it, I played nine holes on Monday and it was really wet because all the rain Sunday night, and it was really windy but opposite wind direction.  That front nine played a lot easier today than having all those par 5s and all those other holes into the wind.   
Yeah, the good thing is with it being windy and it being warm like this these past couple days, it's drying out the golf course.  So the guys are not hitting as many long irons into greens.   
 Q.  I know this is your first time here at a public course like this.  Can you project eight years down the road as fiery as you are, what the atmosphere for a Ryder Cup here might be in 2024?  
PATRICK REED: It's going to be nuts.  I would think it would just be great.  I haven't played one at home, so I don't quite know.  But if it's anything like it was overseas, it's going to be crazy.   
 Q.  Have you been in touch with Davis at all or talked to him at all the last couple weeks?  
PATRICK REED: No.  Not really.  Davis being a player himself, he sees how busy the guys are.  So it's kind of one of those things that he probably doesn't want to interrupt anybody and all that kind of stuff, especially if you're playing every week.
