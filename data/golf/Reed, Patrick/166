 Q.  When you hear that, what does that do for you?  
PATRICK REED: It gets you pumped up.  Gets you ready and kind of gets you going.  Really the main thing is though even when you hear 'em, it gets you going, but you have to still try to be able to handle it emotionally and focus on the task at hand.   
You can't be thinking too far ahead or you're going to struggle with what you're doing right here and now.   
 Q.  Is that kind of good mental preparation for what you'll be doing in the Olympics?  Going to have to control your emotions there.  
PATRICK REED: Yeah, it's going to be a little different when you're there because you're actually going to be at the event.  When you're the week before the event and you're thinking far ahead, you're not focusing on the event you're playing at at the moment.   
So I think it'll be probably how was it at Ryder Cup, and Presidents Cup.  You're going to have those emotions, but it's going to be good energy going into the golf course.   
Even today it was good energy going to the golf course.  You need to make sure you take that energy and focus it on this week and not next week.
