 Q. Such a great historical venue here, does that inspire you here?PATRICK REED: Oh, for sure.  Tiger Woods's event, Tiger's won here, Rory's won here at the U.S. Open.  There's a lot of great players that have won here.  I just can't get ahead of myself.  I just have to focus on each hole and each shot.
Q. Last week at Hartford you stuck around and worked on your game, obviously found something that carried over to this week.  Can you talk about the transition from Hartford to here and maybe one thing that you would really like to do well out there today?PATRICK REED: Putting.  At Hartford I felt like I hit the ball pretty solid, hit my irons great.  Driver ways was a little off but we felt like we fixed that.  I didn't make any putts and that's why I was sitting home on the weekend rather than playing.  So that's basically the main difference and hopefully I can continue to putt well.
Q. Justine is obviously very involved in the game and she came to me on 14 yesterday and said, how many right hole locations are we going to see?  I know she's a mama now but how much is she still involved in the game?PATRICK REED: She's a huge part of it.  She's here during every practice round, here during every round and she's the one that basically tells me what I need to work on and is able to give me little pointers after the round whenever I'm back in the hotel room on what to work on for the following day.
Q. So have you settled on a strategy change or anything different for this afternoon?PATRICK REED: We just need to do the same thing we've been doing all week.  It's been working and the main thing is just stay patient.
