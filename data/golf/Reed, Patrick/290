Q.   3‑under 69 in round two here at Pebble Beach, pretty good playing.   Talk about your round. 
PATRICK REED:   It was solid.   We hit the ball a lot better.   We've just been improving day by day with the ball‑striking.   Felt like we were rolling the ball really well. 
Just missed a couple short putts unfortunately towards the middle of the round, but besides that, to go and play, shoot 69, all pars and three birdies around Pebble Beach, especially when it's windy, it's always a good feeling. 

Q.   Blemish‑free as you mentioned, excellent.   Did you know your drive on 9 was the longest‑recorded drive today at 347 yards?
PATRICK REED:   No, I didn't, but hey, that was finally probably the best 3‑wood I've hit this week.   That used to be my go‑too club and for some reason this week, it's been going right and to step up and hit a really solid one like that, it meant a lot to me.

Q.   When you looked at the yardage book, did it say take anything off the top shelf after that one?
PATRICK REED:   Yeah, it almost told me back off because it gets really narrow.   But it was a perfect drive, put us in great position.   Unfortunately I just couldn't capitalize on it. 

Q.   What was the highlight of your round?   What's the strong part?   What's got you through?
PATRICK REED:   Feels like our course management, managing our game really well, we are keeping the ball in play, where we miss fairways and miss greens and putting it in the right spots.   So we have an easy chip or a straight uphill chip and that's key around these golf courses.   You get downhill, downwind, it's a bear. 

Q.   Playing Spyglass and personal, and Monterey Peninsula tomorrow, what are your thoughts?
PATRICK REED:   If it's blowing like this, keep the ball on the ground.   That course, it seemed like it rolled a lot more than any other courses we play.   The fairways are really low, cut really low.   It's good.   Kind of reminds me of links golf.   Playing the ball on the ground if it's blowing but besides that, it's another great golf course we get to play this week.   Looking forward to it.
