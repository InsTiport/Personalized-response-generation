Q.  When you watch her, do you get nervous when  you watch it?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I need to say that I am absolutely delighted  that we are 3-2 ahead at the end of the first day.  I  thought there was some wonderful golf out there, some  wonderful matches and the three points that Europe won;  and the way in which they won them, I thought was  magnificent.  So I am delighted.  The team is delighted  and obviously in good spirits, and very much looking  forward to tomorrow.  I will be happy to answer any  questions.  I really don't have a lot more to say than  that.  I am sure you can imagine that I feel pretty  happy.

Q.  Were there any turning points in today,  something where you thought maybe it wasn't going your  way, anything surprise you out there?  

MICKEY WALKER: I don't know that there were  any -- nothing the European players would do that would  surprise me in terms of turning on brilliance, if you  like, they are -- as the American players are -- the 20  best players in the world and they are all great  golfers, so they are all capable of playing some great  golf.  And match play inspires you on to greater  things.  The Solheim Cup certainly inspires certain  people to greater things.  I think Catrin Nilsmark, for  example, she just was magnificent today and the 3-putt  she holed on 16, 17 and 18, and the shots that Annika  hit on 16 and 17 were absolutely wonderful.  And I  think beating Beth and Meg was an absolutely fantastic  victory.  In those three middle matches, 2 of them  birdied 16 and 17 and Dale and Lora birdied 17 to win  their matches and throughout the day, looking up at the  score boards and obviously listening on my ear piece to  what was happening, it was incredible how many swings  there were.  Early on, it felt and looked as if the  Americans were getting ahead and then it looked as if  Europe was coming back and we were ahead in more  matches; then it looked like after, almost immediately  after Dottie and Brandie won their match, it wasn't  looking that great for Europe and then as I say in the  space of a very short time, it suddenly really swung.  I mean, there was a five minute spell when Dale and  Lora were playing 16 -- sorry, when they were playing   -- yeah, when they hit their tee shots on 17 and then  Laura hit a magnificent 8-iron into 16; then suddenly I  thought we are going to get at least 3 points, I mean  it swung around, I would say four, five times today.

Q.  Psychologically, how important was that first  point from Nilsmark and Sorenstam.  

MICKEY WALKER: I think it was hugely  psychological.  The match was all square with 3 to go.  Annika, I think, in particular, was very nervous  understandably starting off and they quickly went two  down to Beth and Meg and they came back brilliantly.  I  think it was very, very important.  I mean, if it had  been half a point, it would have been much more  significant than just half the point as it were.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How about the two rookies, to both win. . .  

MICKEY WALKER: Absolutely wonderful.  Fairclough and Annika performed magnificently out  there.  Lora Fairclough, she was nervous at the start  and once they got underway, I chatted to her a couple  of times out there on the course and she really was  having a good time and really enjoying it.  She had a  great time with Dale and was quite relaxed after the  match got underway.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  And she produced the finish as well --  

MICKEY WALKER: Yes, wonderful.  Another  player -- she holed -- although both Kelly and Tammie  and Dale and Lora made a bit of a mess of 16, I mean,  she still holed a wonderful putt, four, five footer for  a half.  I mean, she had to hole it to make Kelly hole  hers.  She made a wonderful putt there and although she  prob -- well, she didn't have to hole it.  They had 2  putts for the match on 17; another wonderful putt.  I  was mentally telling her to get it closer and she  finally knocked it in.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you feel that foursomes are our best  format?  

MICKEY WALKER: Not especially.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Dale did.  That was all --  

MICKEY WALKER:  Not especially.  I mean, I think after  Europeans have an advantage in foursomes because we  play a lot of it but professionals don't play any of it  apart from The Solheim Cup and Ryder Cup, etcetera, so  it is not something we are particularly familiar with;  although, probably, most of the people in the European  team have played foursomes, whereas maybe some of the  Americans maybe haven't and it is a difficult format if  you are struggling with any part of your game, it is  very difficult to get it going.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Have you said anything to Lotte?  Have you  talked to Lotte because she didn't play well at all  today.  

MICKEY WALKER: I have spoken to Lotte since  her match finished and she knows she didn't play that  well and she has been out practicing and feels  confident again and as I have just said, I think  foursomes is such a difficult format; I think she will  be a different person playing tomorrow playing her own  ball.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  She was very a late bloomer; she didn't play  well in the foursomes and then she hit about 8  birdies --  

MICKEY WALKER: She had 7 birdies the second  day when they beat Dottie and Cathy Gerring.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Have you tried to surprise the Americans in  the order tomorrow; is it the same pairings or --  

MICKEY WALKER: I am sure everybody in the  European team would agree that really there are two  pairings that I could play tomorrow, either Alison,  Laura or Lotte and Helen and I just felt that just like  to switch them with Lotte and Helen not having such a  wonderful day, as I say, I don't think they will have  any problems.  I don't think Lotte will have a problem  tomorrow when she is playing her own ball.  I just felt  that it was the right thing that Laura and Alison  should lead the team tomorrow.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  The Americans were saying or some of them  that because foursomes is so alien to them that  actually having won the top and bottom match that  really they can -- this is parity going in; what they  see as their stronger suit.  How do you see it?  

MICKEY WALKER: I understand what you are  saying, but I don't necessarily agree.  If you are  ahead, somebody has got to win more points to beat you,  and I am delighted we are ahead and the team is  delighted and feeling very positive about tomorrow.
