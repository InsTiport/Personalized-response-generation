MICKEY WALKER: I am very pleased that we are  going in tomorrow with a match level because one time  it looked as if we might only get a half a point out of  the final match today.  I think psychologically it was  a great boost to the Europeans that we got the point  out of the final match.  The match couldn't be closer.  I mean, it is  going to be a great day tomorrow.  JoAnne has said all  week and I have said all week that we felt that the  match was going to be very close and it is going to  come down to the wire.  JoAnne has obviously tried to do some second  guessing and so have I.  I wanted some strength at the  top and a lot of strength at the bottom because I think  it is going to come down to the last matches.  We are  playing well.  I felt today that Dottie and Brandie  outputted Alison and Laura.  I think Brandie putted  really well today.  She made a lot of putts and Laura  and Alison from tee to green hit it well.  Laura hit it  close a number of times and couldn't make any putts.  I was delighted with the performance of Lora  and Dale.  I think they have been absolutely fantastic  this week.  Lora especially, the way she has performed  I think is absolutely brilliant.  She has been putting  very well this week and I think that out of all the  Europeans, she has putted the best of any of them.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How do you explain that because she is the  one who has at the least experience of American greens?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think she has got a very  good putting stroke.  I think if you had spoken to any  European player and they said what do you think of Lora  Fairclough and her game, they would have said her  strength is her short game and what a great putter she  is.  I think really good putters, they would always  rather putt on fast greens than maybe more slow greens  and these are fast.  She has a very smooth putting  stroke.  I think -- as I say, if you are a good putter,  you'd always like to putt on fast greens and they  obviously suit her.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  She must be a bit of a freak then.  Everybody  says to become a good putter you have to come to  America where greens are so consistent here we have  Lora Fairclough who putts on slow old greens, yet she  comes here with a good putting stroke and putts well.  I mean, how do you explain that?  
 
MICKEY WALKER:  The question was, how do you explain that  Lora Fairclough, who hasn't ever played in America  before this match, how come she is putting so well on  such fast greens.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Which putter does she use?  How she developed such a good stroke on  such --  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think you can develop a good  stroke.  I think the hardest thing when you putt on  poor greens is working on maintaining a good stroke  when the results don't necessarily reflect your stroke,  it is mental, when you putt on poor greens you miss a  lot of putts and if you then begin to doubt your stroke  then you are dead.  But if you think well, I have got a  great stroke and you are putting on poor greens, then  it doesn't affect you.  I mean, I think Lora, she has  great confidence in her putting stroke when she putts  on good greens, she holes a lot of putts.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  A lot of strategy in the lineup for  tomorrow?  Especially the first two days for you.  Can  you talk a little bit about it, whether you think you  have outfought JoAnne or whether you are agreeing with  her remark which was maybe she thought on this occasion  she had outthought you?  
 
MICKEY WALKER:  The question was, could I talk about my  strategy; whether I feel that I have outthought JoAnne  or she has outthought me, and she believes that she has  outthought me.  JoAnne is going to say that I think the draw  has worked out well for us, and the answer to that  question will be known tomorrow without doubt.  It is  so much the cliche to say it, but the people who win  tomorrow are going to have played good golf and each  and every one of the Europeans has got no illusion that  they are going to win a soft point.  I mean, everybody  has it in their mind that they have got to go out and  play some good golf, whoever they are playing.  And I  mean, some people might be a bit more intimidating in  terms of who they have achieved or the way they have  been playing or their reputations, but every one  person, you know, is potentially beatible.  So I think  it has worked out quite well for Europe.  I am pleased  with the way it has worked out.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  She thought, I think, that you might have  been surprised that she figured out that you would have  played Laura 7th and she therefore figured out  Brandie --  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think that is such a strange  remark, really.  I mean, I thought about what I wanted  to do in general and, you know, Laura -- I was going to  put Laura somewhere in -- that's sort of strange how  she knew I was going to put Laura.  I didn't know I was  going to put Laura 7th until a minute before I had to  have my pairings in, so I mean, she can't say that she  knows I am going to put Laura out 7th.  I mean, it is  just a freak.  You know, that it has come out that it  is a rematch of the top match at Dalmahoy.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Why have you hidden Laura Davies, your best  player, at number 7 which is a nothing sort of  position?  Why did you decide to put her there?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I certainly don't think it is  a nothing sort of position.  I think it could be a very  critical position.  I feel there is a lot of strength  at the bottom of the European team.  And I think that  is a very critical position.  I don't think it is a  nothing position at all.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  It is not a very inspirational position; I  mean, provided the inspiration the last time from the  top.  And do you find you have put strength at the  top?  I mean, I am not talking about number one, but  generally, one through five?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I think the bottom line, if --  I mean, I spoke to everyone in the team about where  they would like to play, and at the end of the day  obviously it is my responsibility to make a decision  about where I put people and, you know, you have a gut  feeling about something and this is my gut feeling  about what I wanted to do; put a lot of strength at the  bottom.  I feel there is quite a lot of strength at the  top.  I mean, I don't think there is especially a weak  player in the European team and there certainly isn't  in the American team.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, do you get concerned that Laura's  victories or defeats are very vital to the mentality of  your team as a result, there is sort of a domino effect  that she carries?  
 
MICKEY WALKER:  The question was, do I get very concerned  about Laura's defeats having a very negative affect on  the team.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  That is one part of the question, yeah.  
 
MICKEY WALKER: I don't think so.  I think  Laura is an inspirational person, she is an  inspirational team member and she is human. I mean, she  is the best player in the world at the moment, but she  is in a match-play situation.  She is beatible, just as  Beth Daniel is, just as any one of the Americans are,  you know.  So, inevitably, she is not going to win  every single time she plays, but we expect her to win  every single time she plays.   
 Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  As a result, when she loses, do you get  concerned that the team could have a domino affect, so  to speak?  
 
MICKEY WALKER: No, I don't think that at  all.  I don't think so.  I mean, you know, you could  have said that yesterday because Lotte didn't play very  well, and she is one of the best players in the world  at the moment.  And she -- you know, she played poorly  yesterday, but she played well today.  And no, I don't  think that has a psychologically negative affect on the  team at all.
