MICKEY WALKER:  I don't know about the  strategy.  I suppose I felt that maybe Joanne would  expect me to put Laura/Alison out first, so I didn't.  But really, that is -- I obviously wanted to put who I  considered a strong pairing out first, which is very  apparent, and spread the other teams around.  Any questions?  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Are you happy with the way the matches have  gone?  

MICKEY WALKER:  Yes, very much so.  I mean,  you know, every match is worth a point and we know we  have got to play well to win those points, and at the  end of the day, we have got to get out and play well.  It doesn't matter which of the American pairings we are  playing against.  They are all good.  Approach every  match -- Solheim match that Laura has ever played, she  played against Mochrie.  She and Helen played Mochrie  at Dalmahoy.  I don't know if she played against her  twice at Lake Nona.  She certainly played against her  once before.  I know Laura and Alison have played  against Betsy King a lot, so it is much almost like it  is inevitable that it will be matched somehow.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  What about the form of everybody; have you  watched them today?  

MICKEY WALKER:  The question was:  How is the  form of the Europeans today in practice.  I saw very little of them today because I had  to attend a meeting.  What I did see, they were playing  well and in good form.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Are you worried that they haven't seen enough  of the golf course?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I think Laura has seen less  of the course than anyone.  I believe she sometimes  tees it up in tournaments without having seen the  course at all, so one practice round, plus three holes  yesterday, that is a lot for Laura, so she is well  prepared.  The majority of the Europeans have seen the  course.  Most of them have seen it at least twice.  I  think -- I mean, they are all very familiar with it.  I  mean, they have seen it enough for their benefit and  for me to be comfortable.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, what was your thinking in playing  with the Swedes instead of Laura and Alison the first  match?  

MICKEY WALKER:  You must have missed my  opening comment.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Sorry.  

MICKEY WALKER:  That is okay.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  What is the reasoning about the split up this  year?  

MICKEY WALKER:  Sorry, I am just thinking  before I speak.  As you know, there are two rookies in  our team, Lora Fairclough being one of them.  She is a  good friend of Dale's.  She really wanted to play with  Dale, and I felt that was a good pairing with Dale  being a very experienced Solheim Cup player and being a  very laid back sort of person.  I thought that would be  a really good pairing.  I mean, Laura is very relaxed.  She is really enjoying this week; being part of the  team and everything about the week, but I just felt  with a couple of rookies in the team, that some of the  pairings -- although Dale and Pam were, I felt, a very  strong pairing at Dalmahoy, although they only won half  a point, that inevitably you can't always play your  ideal pairings because you have other things to  consider.  And as I say, with Lora being a rookie, I  think it is important to pair her with an experienced  player and it just worked out that way.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  What about the inexperience of Sorenstam and  Nilsmark?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I don't think that is a  problem.  I think both of them, although they are both  young and you might say inexperienced in terms of the  Solheim Cup, I think they have got old heads on young  shoulders.  Catrin proved that she can rise to the  occasion, and I believe she is, as each week goes by,  her game improves, and I have -- and Annika, you know,  she is a rookie here this year; a very good player and  likewise, she is improving all the time; has a very  calm head on her and they are good friends; wanted to  play together and I think they will be a very strong  pairing.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Have you gone along with everybody's wishes  in who they wanted to play with?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I have gone along with my  wishes, but obviously I consider what everybody says.  I mean, one of the really nice things about this team  is virtually anybody would have been happy to play with  anyone else.  Some people had preferences, as I say,  Lora Fairclough feels -- I mean, some of the people who  play a lot in Europe, I mean, for instance, she hadn't  ever met Pam Wright before, before she came to The  Greenbrier, so I am not going to put her with a total  stranger or somebody she has hardly had a conversation  with.  So, as much as possible, I think I did the  pairings according to the wishes of the players, and  all the players are happy with their pairings.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, as you look down the pairing sheet, I  hope this doesn't sound like a ridiculous question, but  for either team, do you see pretty much a sure win as  you look down that pairing sheet?  

MICKEY WALKER:  Absolutely not.  No.  You  can't predict any one of the European pairings could  beat any one of the Americans and vice versa.  I mean,  you know, everybody has their opinions about some that  are more likely than others, but I wouldn't bet on any  of them.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  How have the teams been finding the greens?  I understand it is playing fast now.  

MICKEY WALKER:  They really like them.  I  think all good putters like to putt on fast, true  surfaces, and these are very fast.  As you say, they  are very true and there is a premium on being on the  right place on the green below the hole, and there is,  I am sure, inevitably on greens this fast, you are  going to see a comedy of errors on the greens.  Inevitably, the players aren't going to hit those shots  to the green in the right places all the time.  It is  impossible.  And I am sure we will see some 3-putts  this week if not the very occasional 4-putt, but we are  going to see some fireworks on the greens, I am sure.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Does it seem, Mickey, to you that there is  less animosity between the two teams than there was in  Scotland?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I think there is a really  good feeling this week, and I can't really explain  why.  But no, I feel there is really a good feeling.  I  mean, as JoAnnne has said on previous occasions, there  has been some banter going on between the teams and,  no, I think the matches will be played where both of us  are out to win and when that is finished, that is  finished.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Mickey, I know you have really been over this  course with a fine-tooth comb.  How about --  

MICKEY WALKER:  I haven't.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  You haven't been over most of the holes and  looked at the greens?  

MICKEY WALKER:  No, I haven't.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  What about the players, were they exchanging  notes with each other and thoughts about certain holes  and the way certain holes should be played?  

MICKEY WALKER:  Yes.  A couple of the  European caddies, Mark Scott, caddy and Mathew Loris  (phonetic) caddy went out did the yardages during the  beginning of the week and detailed diagrams of the  greens where the slopes are; where you should be  ideally playing from; where you might want to hit your  shot to the greens; all those sort of things.  The  players have discussed those things.  They have all got  their yardages and the details of the green and they  have gone into a lot of detail about that.  As I said,  it is going to be one of the key factors this week,  hitting your shots to the greens in the right place,  giving yourself a chance to putt well.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Do you feel more nervous this week?  

MICKEY WALKER:  No, I don't.  I feel less  nervous but I might feel more nervous tomorrow.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  Why?  

MICKEY WALKER:  I said I might.  I don't  know, John.  Everyday is a new experience in life and  tomorrow is another new experience.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  The thought has occurred to me if you were to  win this year, you might be coming back as captain as  Dame Mickey.  We might have to curtsey.  

MICKEY WALKER:  I don't think you'd have to  curtsey.  
Ãï¿½Ã  

Q.  I would. .  

MICKEY WALKER:  Thank you.
