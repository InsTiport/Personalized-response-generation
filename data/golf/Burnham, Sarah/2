SARAH BURNHAM: Yeah.  I didn't know.  I was just playing golf out there today.  So, having a good time.
Q. How did you feel about your round today?
SARAH BURNHAM: Really good.  Probably one of my best rounds of my life so far, not the lowest but just to be at a Major at 2-under par, it's something I needed to do to make it -- possibly make the cut, yeah.
Q. What do you think enabled you to have one of the best rounds of your life, were you calm or --
SARAH BURNHAM: Yeah, I was a little nervous.  But I just stuck the my plan of hitting greens and fairways.  I definitely felt a little bit more relaxed today than yesterday.  I knew I had to play aggressive.  It was the only chance I had.  I was able to do that.
Q. Were you aware of the cut line, where you stand now?
SARAH BURNHAM: I'm at +5 and I think the cut line is +5 right now.
Q. Did you have that in your head as you were going around?
SARAH BURNHAM: Kind of.  I thought I was going to have to shoot even or better to make the cut today.  When I made my birdie putt on the par 5, No. 3, I felt like I just needed to stay calm and par out or even make another one if I could.
Q. How long was that putt?
SARAH BURNHAM: Probably like 25 feet.
Q. Oh, wow.
SARAH BURNHAM: It was a bomb.
Q. You hit the ball well today.  It was windy out there.
SARAH BURNHAM: Definitely made the difference.  I hit more fairways.  Easier to stop on the greens than being in the rough.
Q. How big would you guess your gallery was today?
SARAH BURNHAM: Oh, gosh.  At the beginning I would say at least maybe 75 to 100 when I teed off.  Yeah, it got kind of big and settled down a little bit but it was really fun.
Q. How many people did you know when you looked outside the ropes?
SARAH BURNHAM: It was funny, I told my caddy on the tee, "Oh, my gosh, I recognize so many people.  I'm not sure I know everyone's name."  It was really cool to see them all out there.
Q. What were you thinking about the branch that fell down?
SARAH BURNHAM: Wow, okay, it's actually very windy out here.  Tough day.  Yeah.
Q. How close were you to it?
SARAH BURNHAM: We were walking up like to the green of No. 4, the par 3 and it kind of just sounded like fire cracker.  All of a sudden this huge branch fell down.  It was like so windy.  I played it up.  My ball went sky high.
Q. How many tickets did you end of getting?
SARAH BURNHAM: Probably 15.  I couldn't make a request to everybody but I think my agent got a couple more and maybe my caddy did, too.
Q. How does it feel to be able the play two more rounds?
SARAH BURNHAM: It means so much.  It's crazy I got in.  To make the cut on the number, also another crazy surprise to me.  I mean everything is just kind of working in my favor this week.  I'm just so like lucky and honored to be here.
Q. Do you have a high school coach here?
SARAH BURNHAM: He was here yesterday.  He had to go out of town.  Yeah.  Mike Shoemacher.  He came out yesterday.
