   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Congratulations on a great round today.  You entered the day tied for third and now you are tied for the lead.  Talk about your round for a minute.   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Sure.  It was a good day.  The driver was good, kept me in play.  So it was just fun.  I had a good time.  My group was playing well, so just kind of did what we did.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over the scorecard, birdies and bogeys?   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Birdie on 2.  I hit 5-iron into the green and 2-putted from about twenty feet probably.   
 I birdied on 5.  I hit 7-wood into that green and 2-putted from about 5 feet.   
 No. 9, I hit 8-iron in and made about a six-foot putt for birdie.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  I think you had a bogey on 3.   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Yeah, I hit that one just short of the green.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club?   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  5-iron short, chipped up, and 2-putted.   
 10, hit 6-iron in and made about a six-foot putt for birdie.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And 15?   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  15, I hit 7-iron just over the green and 2-putted.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  All right.  Questions for Jamie.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Obviously that's where we all want to be, so it's pretty exciting to be in contention going into the weekend.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  No.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  It's probably a little drier than we normally see it, which is nice.  You're getting a little more roll in the fairway so you hit some shorter clubs into the green.  It's in good shape.  It's a lot of fun.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Yeah.  That was a comfortable group.  I enjoyed playing with both Charlotta and Tina.   
 When the group is playing well it obviously loosens everybody up a little more, so we had fun.  It was fun to watch them making birdies, too.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  I prefer the afternoon.  I am not a morning person.  I try to be on those days that it requires me to, but the good thing about going out early is you have fresh greens.   
 You know, the conditions this morning were great, but if I had my pick I'd tee it up at noon every day.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Right, exactly.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Yeah.  I think my putter could have been a little better over the last couple of days.  Maybe a few nice putts, but most of my birdies were either 2-putt or really close.   
 So, yeah, there was some opportunity out there that I think had my putter been on the right track I would have made.   
 Obviously you can find something in every round.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  I love the heat.  Being in Dallas this is very comfortable to me.  I'd much rather be sweaty than have a few layers on.  Yeah, this is great.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that will affect the afternoon?   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  You know, the good thing about Corning is there's shade.  You can sneak off and find some shade.  I think they'll be fine.   
 Obviously you have to make sure you drink water and all that, but it's kind of nice to break a sweat.   
  
  Q.  Are you in for an afternoon of scoreboard watching?   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  Actually, my housing is taking me to the rock wall museum, so I'll just have a nice relaxing afternoon.   
 I've got a little bit of laundry to do, and I'm sure I'll check the leaderboard before I go to bed tonight.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JAMIE HULLETT:  You know, I don't know.  It depends.  It seems pretty accessible today.  You know, our group, I know there were a lot of putts out there that we just missed.   
 But I have to think there's going to be a couple of players at least to shoot some pretty low numbers today.
