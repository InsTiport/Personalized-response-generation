  Q. What is the moment like for you?  
 BETH DANIEL: Well, you know what, most of the day I didn't think it was going to happen (tearing up). It's great.   
  
  Q. There was a while that it was looking like Europe had this thing going. Talk about your team's ability to rally on the back nine.   
 BETH DANIEL: Well, through 12, 13 and 14 today, they just turned it around. I mean, that was definitely the turning point for us yesterday afternoon, it was the turning point for us today. And I just can't even believe they've done this because it really for a while didn't look like it was going to be possible.  
  
  Q. Was there something in particular that you said to get them back in the game?  
 BETH DANIEL: You know, Meg, Kelly and I just said, we need to stay positive today and we need to be positive for them and calm, and that's all we did. They wanted par-3 yardages, how they were playing, and that's kind of what I did. I just did what I did the rest of the week for them.  
  
  Q. A couple of performances that stand out in your mind today?  
 BETH DANIEL: Well, let me tell you, Juli Inkster's comeback was pretty darned gutsy, and those three matches that went out the first three points were impressive because we really needed those. Helen Alfredsson gave Michelle Wie quite the match, and then for Brittany Lang to come back and tie Laura Davies in that match, all of those were huge.   
 But you know what, everybody has contributed to this, and I can't be more proud of this team.
