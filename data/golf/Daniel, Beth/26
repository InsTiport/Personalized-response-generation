Q.  You started out fast, kept the pressure on all through the match. 

BETH DANIEL:   We birdied the first hole, got 1-up on the first hole.  We tried to just keep the pressure on them and stay up.  That's what you have to do in match play.  Once you get up you have to put more pressure on them. 


Q.  Juli, your chip in at 8, that had to add extra pressure?

JULI INKSTER:  It was a lucky chip.  But you know what, that's match play.  That's what it's all about is when you least expect it somebody makes a shot like that.  Then you're kind of like, "Oh, my gosh, how did she do that".  But it was a great birdie, got us another hole and we just kind of kept going from there.


Q.  You got us back in the game this afternoon.  How will you attack this tomorrow?

BETH DANIEL:  Tomorrow is a whole different story.  12 singles matches.  We have to play well tomorrow.  Everyone has to play well tomorrow.  We've got our work cut out for us.


Q.  The conditions are pretty good out there today.  The wind died down.  The greens are okay. 

JULI INKSTER:   This is more than we ever expected, the weather here.  We had one day of rain, but it was a practice day.  Other than that the sun has been shining.  The wind is going to blow, that's what it does out here.  I'm very pleased with the weather.


Q.  The forecast is for it being a little dicey tomorrow.  What does that do to this course?

BETH DANIEL:   When the wind blows, particularly today when we had the prevailing wind, it plays tough.  It plays really tough.  Particularly 8, 9, 10, and 11 played very, very tough down on the water.  We'll see what happens.  Weather forecasters have been wrong before, but we'll just have to deal with whatever we get.
