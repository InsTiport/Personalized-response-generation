Q.  Paula, everything is a first for you today.  Tell us about your morning and getting here in general.

PAULA CREAMER:  I was lucky I had the first tee shot today.  I was excited about it.  I had a great time out there, especially with Beth.  It was really good, and our chemistry on the golf course was    we thrive off of each other and had some good shots out there.
Q.  Beth, a lot of pressure being the most experienced player out there, the oldest player in the Solheim Cup, certainly everyone relies on you.  What were your thoughts?

BETH DANIEL:  I told Paula, we have to hit fairways and greens.  You know, as it worked out, she was putting all the time and I was just trying to give her opportunities to make birdie, and she had it rolling there, and on 11, missed a putt there, and from then on, we really didn't make anything, so I feel like we played really well.  We gave ourselves so many opportunities, and we shot under par.  I think we shot 2 under par today, and it was just a really good match.
Q.  We'll see more of those and both of you and congratulations on halving your match, and thanks.

PAULA CREAMER:  Thanks.

BETH DANIEL:  Thank you.
