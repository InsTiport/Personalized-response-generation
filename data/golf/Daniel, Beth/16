Q.  I'm here with the team of Inkster and Daniel and, you know, it sounds like you guys are not happy with the result?

BETH DANIEL:  No, I'm not happy with half a point.  You know, I felt like Juli and I played very well, and, you know, to only get a half out of it, and really, I mean, you have to figure that Iben is going to make that putt on the last hole, so they're probably not happy either.  I'm sure.
Q.  On paper you guys, obviously, are the huge favorites.  Do you think that makes it easier for them in some sense because they have nothing to lose and put the pressure on you to win it?

JULI INKSTER:  I think deep down Beth and I know we didn't play our best golf today, or close to it.  My head was still spinning after that morning match.  It took me four or five holes to calm down.  Beth was spinning because I was spinning.

It really took us to the back side to get into this thing.  Half a point, you know what, we're not happy with it, but it's better than no points.
Q.  To look optimistically, you guys have 2 and a half points between you as a pair in this fourball, so congratulations.

JULI INKSTER:  She won't dump me yet.
