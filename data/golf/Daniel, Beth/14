Q.  Take us through your match.  Seeing all that red on the leaderboard had to be great.
BETH DANIEL:  I really didn't look on the leaderboard.  I was really concerned with my own golf.  So, I'm glad, after I'm through, that there is a lot of red going in and we looked like we're in pretty good shape.
