Q.  I'm here with Beth Daniel, eight time member of the Solheim Cup.  You were an integral part of the success.  If you can think of two or three things that really made the difference, what would that be this week?
BETH DANIEL:  Number one, I think the practice rounds together, seeing this golf course three times before the week of the event, being able to bond as a team and get to know these rookies really well.  You try to make the rookies comfortable and they played great for us.
Q.  Can you describe how proud you are to get the Solheim Cup back, not let it go away on US soil?
BETH DANIEL:  This is a great win for us.  Personally, I thought this golf course set up better for the European team as far as how they hit the ball and everything else.

It was a tough win for us and hard fought battle, as they all are.
Q.  Congratulations on a successful Solheim Cup.
