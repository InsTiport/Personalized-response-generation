  Q.  Tough match out there today with Cink getting off to such a quick start.  I think he shot 29 on the front.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah.  He played great on the front.   
  
  Q.  So did you.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  I was playing okay.  And then he cooled off a little bit.  I had some chances on the back nine.  For some reason, kind of all day today, I struggled reading the greens.  I hit a lot of good putts and hit a lot of putts that went over the edges.  But I had a pretty tough task after that front nine he played.   
  
  Q.  Right.  Any putt in particular there on 10, 11 and 12 that might have made a difference?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Well, yeah, any one of them.  I felt like if I could just get something to drop they'd start going because I was hitting a lot of good putts.  But for some reason I really struggled reading the greens and I was off just that much.   
  
  Q.  I know you're playing the consolation match tomorrow, but it's been a good week and you're still on that roll.  You have to have a pretty positive attitude?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, it has been a good week.  Right now I'm disappointed with this afternoon.  I've got to get ready and come out and play tomorrow and I'll start focusing on that here in a couple of hours.
