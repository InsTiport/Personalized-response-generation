Q.  Not much you can do when the guys are making birdie after birdie.

JUSTIN LEONARD:  No, there's not.  I think we both could have played as good as possible, and I don't know if we'd have done anything different, might have played a few more holes.
Q.  Talk about 36 holes for you today, a halve and a loss, summarizing the day for you.

JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, not a lot of fun.

SCOTT VERPLANK:  You know, we had a great match this morning.  This afternoon, I think they were 11 under through 13 holes or something, just blistered it.  We could not keep up that pace.  We played okay.

We didn't play great, but we were kind of laughing at the last hole here.  Saying, well, even if we did play great, we'd still be one or two down.  That was pretty impressive actually.
Q.  Both of you guys have been wanting to play together for a long time and you finished 2 1 1; talk about your four matches together.

SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, we matched up very well together.  We had a lot of fun playing, we enjoy each other's company.

Other than running into a buzzsaw here this afternoon, we did all right together.

JUSTIN LEONARD:  Ditto.
