  Q.  Tell me about your day.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  You know, it was a fun day.  I hit the ball pretty well, made a few putts.  There were a couple I'd like to have back.  I had a great shoot into 15, but missed the putt.  Birdied 16 and 18, and made a nice up and down on 17.   
  
  Q.  You were the only one so far read that I've seen read that putt correctly on 18.  Tell me how good it feels when you look on the leaderboard and know you're close.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It feels very good.  It's amazing, because it's been so long, but it's still a very familiar feeling.  I feel fortunate that it is, that I don't have to get in there a few times to really get comfortable.  I was nervous today, but somewhat comfortable, and I think I was able to use some of that energy to my advantage.
