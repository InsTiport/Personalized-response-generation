 Q. Tell me about that eagle on the fourth hole. 
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it was nice. I hit it in there to a foot on 3 and made the long walk over to 4 and pin was up front. A good driver, just trying to get it up around the front part of the green, and it just snuck on the front edge, and I had about a 12- or 15-footer, and poured it right in. Nice to get it up-and-down with a driver. 

 Q. And how about that putt on 18 for birdie to shoot 65?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it was nice, you know, breaking a couple cups, and I was hoping to hit it a little closer with my third shot, but I guess it was just close enough. 

 Q. A bogey-free 65 puts you in good position after this first round. Was it an easy day or was it a little bit more difficult than it looked?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It felt pretty easy at times, and you know, other times I had to get a couple balls up-and-down. With the greens as fast as they are, you're going to have to make some five- or six-footers, and obviously I made all of those today. So it was a fun day.

 Q. It's been a little while since you made some noise on a Sunday. This week is a Monday finish on the PGA, but since the British Open. Talk about maybe putting your foot on the pedal a little bit now that the Playoffs are really in gear. 
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, these next two weeks are really important. I want to get in the TOUR Championship, and that's a goal of everybody at the end of the year. So a good couple weeks will take care of that and build some momentum going into The Presidents Cup.
