 Q. Did you make the most of an early start?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: No.

 Q. Tell me about the couple of putts that ran the edge on the last three holes. What was the issue with that, reading the greens? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I don't think there was an issue. Two of them I had a good putt. 
 The last hole I hit a great putt, but that had started with a bad tee shot.

 Q. Any other hole you work out and try to get ready for the afternoon?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Just going to go eat breakfast again and get ready to play.
