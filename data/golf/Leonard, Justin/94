  Q.  Rounds of 68 and 68 in rounds one and two, and a 65 today, 5-under par, 9-under par for the golf tournament with 28 putts.  Solid rounds, you happy?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, pretty pleased with today.  Had a couple nice putts, like a 30-footer and al 35-footer.  Missed a couple putts that I felt like I should have made in the eight to ten foot range, and still, a really solid day.   
 You know, I didn't really watch the leaderboards today, so you know, hopefully I'll be close enough to have a chance tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  If there's a recipe for success on this golf course, what would you say it is?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Well, I think it's pretty important to put the ball in the fairway.  It's tough to control the ball out of the rough.  You get some good lies, but other times, you're guessing a little bit.   
 You know, from there, you can play aggressive at times.  But with the greens the way they are, some holes, it's pretty difficult to get the ball close, and I don't think there's any person recipe that works.  I just think that you have to play solid and hit a lot of good putts.
