 Q.  Justin, you drop a shot on the round and have kind of a roller coaster round and you're going to be closer to the lead on Sunday morning probably than you were on Saturday morning.  It's wind, isn't it? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, this golf course is playing pretty tough.  I was 3-under through 5, and playing pretty good, making putts, and all of a sudden the holes started jumping out of the way.  You know, I hit the ball okay, not great, still had a lot of good putts that didn't go in.  Hopefully I can get those to go in tomorrow. 

 Q.  At 18 you hit a great second in that I thought was going to roll over and just trickle in.  It was going downhill and it stopped.  That's when things are tough. 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, that's kind of the way things have been going, because if that ball -- probably needs to roll like another couple inches and it's going to be about five feet and a pretty easy putt.  Instead I've got a putt that's breaking two feet straight downhill.  You know what, those things all even out in the end. 

 Q.  You're a major champion.  This has been major tough, hasn't it? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah.  We haven't had any wind, either.  I can't imagine what the scores would be like if we had had a good 10-, 15-mile-an-hour breeze.  But the golf course, it's so firm right now, it's -- you look at some of these pins and you just start to laugh.  But, you know, it's supposed to rain tomorrow, soften up a little bit, and if that happens, we might see some better scores. 

 Q.  Outside of Oakmont, the toughest you've played this year? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, probably so, yeah. 

 Q.  Well, good luck to you. 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  All right, thank you.
