  Q. So close, like she said. Just a couple comments. You gotta feel good about the whole week overall. Just as far as your ball playing. Just a couple comments.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. I mean it was a good week overall. Obviously, you know, to be this close and not be able to pull it out is disappointing.   
 I had such good putts in regulation on 18, and you know, obviously I thought I made it by my reaction. Surprised it didn't go in, but you know, it is what it is. I hit the ball great. Didn't putt that well this weekend, and you know, that was the difference.   
  
  Q. Well, you obviously are not going to walk away with the victory, but as you head into the off season, what are you going to focus on and look forward to in 2010?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I'm going to just rest a little bit and keep working on things I'm working on because my golf game's getting better, and it's been pretty good here in the last couple of months, and you know, just keep working on the same thing.  
  
  Q. Will you tell us 18 in regulation what you hit into the green there?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I hit a 5-iron, I don't know, 18 feet or so, and you know, had it about a foot, maybe a little more than that outside, and again, three or four feet from the hole I thought it was in, and 6 inches from the hole I thought it was in.
