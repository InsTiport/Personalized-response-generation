  Q. Nice way to finish that round with the long putt at 9. 4-under par, good playing today?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it was good. I didn't hit it great on the first nine, which is the back nine. Got it around okay, and then I didn't really find anything, but I just sort of hit some better shots and was able to make a few birdies there on the front side. Nice to finish off with a long-ish putt there at 9.   
  
  Q. Is this a golf course that you feel like you should play well on?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, I enjoy this golf course. You've got to work the ball both directions. It really pays dividends to hit the ball in the fairway. The rough is thick, and there's only six or eight yards of rough, and the rest is trees.   
 So the kind of course where I think positioning, plotting your way around and just giving yourself opportunities, and that's what I did today. Going to try to do that the rest of the week.  
  
  Q. Is this a golf course that you need to have all parts of your game going?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yes, a course like this will expose any weaknesses for sure. It's hard to scramble a whole lot around this place.
