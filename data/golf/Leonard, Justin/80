  Q. Your goal for the week was to better your overall standings, maybe to get into the CA Championship, you've done well in that quest?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yes I have but it is hard to lose two matches there right at the end of the week.   
  
  Q.  Any keys to the match today?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  No, I just didn't play good. Henrik played very well and got off to a great start which was always going to be tough for me to get back into things. I tried hard, but I just didn't play good enough.
