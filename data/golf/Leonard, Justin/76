 Q. Can you talk about the round today?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I got off to a bad start, hit it in the water on 3, and then just kind of plodded along, made a bunch of pars, made a couple birdies late, then missed a short putt at 17. All in all, it was a little disappointing. 

 Q. Was the wind a factor today? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, absolutely. It was blowing 20 miles an hour most of the time, and it was definitely a factor.

 Q. Talk about the changes that have been made to the course. Do you like them? Is the course a little bit more difficult? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, I think that the golf course was more difficult today because it played fairly long and the greens were very firm. It's difficult to try to get the ball close to the hole.

 Q. Do you like the improvements to the course, the changes that have been made?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I think it's a definite improvement over what we played the last couple years. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Well, I need to hit the ball a little closer to the hole and make a few more putts.
