Q. Justin, one nice solid opening round.  Tell me about it.
JUSTIN LEONARD: Played a sloppy first hole at the 10th and then after that started hitting some greens and putting the ball in play which is are things I need to do and make a putt here and there and got it under par and with a, you know, a fortunate shot out of the rough on 2, playing it into the bank up-front and rolled up to a foot.
And then I hit some good shots after that.  Didn't hit as many greens on the second 9 but I was in spots where I was putting from rather than chipping and, you know, around this place you start chipping it can kind of make you look silly with some of the bermuda grass.  I was able to keep the ball on the ground and, you know, just a good, solid day.
Q. I think there's so much grain in that bermuda around the greens that little bit luck depending on if you're with or against the grain can really make up and downs differently at this golf course.
JUSTIN LEONARD: It can.  It can, especially when you're -- there's not a lot of low areas but if you get to where you've got to pitch it and it's tight it can be really difficult.
Fortunately I was in spots where either, you know, fringe or, you know, maybe a couple yards short of a green where there was enough grass to go through to really worry about it and, you know, just kind of manage my game which is what I need to be doing.
Q. Good job.  Thank you.
JUSTIN LEONARD: Thank you.
