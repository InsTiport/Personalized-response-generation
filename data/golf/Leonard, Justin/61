  Q. Justin, you are not going to relinquish this title easily. You came out and shot yourself right back into the tournament.  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. Would love to have been 2, 3 better and that was possible today with the way I played. I'm pleased to shoot 6-under.   
 There's a lot of golf to be played today. I have to see kind of where the leaders are. It's going to take another round like that or better to have a chance tomorrow.  
  
  Q. I watched you play on Thursday or Friday. I thought you hit the ball fine. Difference today, you obviously made a few more putts.  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: You said it. I hit the ball fine. I probably hit the ball just a little bit better today. Had a couple more putts at it and today I made a few of those putts.   
 I missed a couple on the back-9 which kind of sapped some of the momentum out, but I've been stroking the ball well but just not making a lot this week and was able to make a few more today.  
  
  Q. Overcast conditions. Was the course playing a little softer at all?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Not really softer but the ball wasn't going quite as far because the air is a little bit heavy. The last couple days it's been so dry and hot here that the ball really carries a lot.   
 So, the course is playing a little bit longer but, you know, most of the guys aren't going to notice it that much.  
  
  Q. I'll cut you loose. I know you want to watch that OU-Texas game.  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, thank you.
