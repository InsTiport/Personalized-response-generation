  Q. I know it's not the way you wanted it to end, but you ended it nicely with the par putt on 18. You struggled all day on the greens and couldn't make anything.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, I hit the ball better today from tee to green. You know, I left some out there. Obviously three on the front side and then a couple more on the back.  
 Made a nice putt there at 18, but, you know, unfortunately I -- Luke played a great round of golf today. I needed to make some more birdies before I got to the last four holes, because they're hard to make birdies on.  
  
  Q. As you look back at the work you've done recently, how much did that help you today?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It helped quite a bit. You know, I hit some good putts. Couple of the ones early I didn't hit such a great putt, but I hit a good putt at 7 that missed. Hit a pretty good putt at 12, the par-3. It just got eaten up by the green.   
 Had good putt at 13 as well.  
 14 was okay, but I just, you know, I didn't quite read those putts correctly. Unfortunately I didn't get the right -- sometimes you can misread a little bit on Bermudagrass and the green might catch it and go in, and I didn't have any of that today.   
  
  Q. Well finishing off this way has got to make you feel good about a year that you struggled. Now you're got to be looking forward to 2012.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it's a good way to end this year certainly from the year that I've had and wanting to use these last three weeks to really kind of look more towards next year.  
 So this is a good way to finish, and, you know, leaves a better taste in my mouth certainly than there was going into the week.
