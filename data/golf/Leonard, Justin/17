  Q. Solid day out there today.  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. Nothing real special. Drove the ball really well. You know, took advantage of a few holes early and then from there I didn't hit the ball very close and didn't have a whole lot of opportunities.   
 You know, I had a few 40, 50-footers and I hit some good putts and, you know, pleased with the day. Could be a little better but I'm in good shape going into tomorrow and Sunday.  
  
  Q. Even though you're 5 back, do you feel like you have a charge for the weekend and make a run at this?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. Five back with two days to play, I'm not going to say it's nothing but it's very attainable. But, you know, again, just want to build on the things I've done the last couple days. I don't feel like I've had a great round. I've had a couple solid rounds and I got some nice momentum going into the weekend.
