JUSTIN LEONARD:  The fairway bunkers are playing well. You can hit the ball real straight and still it in some bunkers. 
 

Q.  Is that aggravating?
 
JUSTIN LEONARD:  No, it is not aggravating.  The bunkers are really good this year, the sand.  I think I have had clean lies just about every time I have been in one, so -- but, yeah, it certainly makes you think about it.  You hit some -- I have hit more 3-woods this year than I have in the past because I am hitting the ball a little longer and, you know, I like playing some turf.  So makes it a little easier. 
 

Q.  What did you hit into 1?
 
JUSTIN LEONARD:  5-iron. 
 

Q.  How easy is that playing?
 
JUSTIN LEONARD:  It was kind of down a little bit right-to-left and it is such a tight driving area, so if you get it between the bunkers, you know, you are going to have a 3, somewhere from a 3 to 6-iron in.  So -- but the important thing is getting the ball in play. 
 

Q.  When you saw who was in the field were you a little bit surprised that more of the Top-10, Top-20 weren't joining you here?
 
JUSTIN LEONARD:  This has always had a strong field and because guys don't play that much in the West Coast and guys that live in Florida will take the last couple weeks off of the West Coast and get going here.  But with the Match Play being last week, maybe a little bit surprised, more guys didn't show.  But we are trying to get good fields in as many places we can.  And I think that as good as the shape as the golf course is in, that you will see guys tweaking their schedule and they will come back.  I am not worried about that at all.
