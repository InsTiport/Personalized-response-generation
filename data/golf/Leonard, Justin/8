  JUSTIN LEONARD:   I'm pleased with today.   Going around here, bogey‑free is pretty fun.   Throwing more birdies. I had a few putts there towards the end of the round but nothing I could really‑‑ putts that I had to be careful with.   And couple of putts early in the round, looks going up the hill and can be a bit more aggressive on.  
But still pleased with the day, the way I hit it.   Nice to get it up and down there on the 18th.  
   
 Q.   To that point I thought your speed controls on the green was spectacular, couple of nice lags.   To get back out there tomorrow ‑‑ they were receptive today, you know you got a chance at them again in early scoring positions tomorrow morning.   
JUSTIN LEONARD:   Yeah, it's always nice to shoot a good first round but to get it in the afternoon and then not have too much time in between rounds, looking forward to getting back out here in the morning.  
   
 Q.   How do you manage this golf course?   I know it's got some length to it, the rough is finally up after a pretty dormant winter, but to put yourself in the right spots on the course is more key than some others I would imagine.   
JUSTIN LEONARD:   I've got to take care of the shorter holes, get some myself some good looks.   And I'm not going to reach all the par 5s like a lot of these guys do.   
So for me it's just putting it in the right spot and trying to dial in the wedges.
