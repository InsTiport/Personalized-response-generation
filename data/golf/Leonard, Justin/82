  Q.  Eight birdies in 11 holes?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, I played really good today, and it was starting at 10 Stuart made eagle and then birdied 11 and 12.  And I just felt like I had to keep making birdies just to maintain somewhat of a lead.  And then hit a really good shot into 13 and a great shot into 14, and then closed out with a couple of pars.   
  
  Q.  You've been playing really well lately, and I know you've played well in this match play format.  Is there something different in your game?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  It's a lot of things different.  I keep thinking back to a year ago and where my game was and where I was mentally.  I think I just really appreciate playing well.  I'm having a lot of fun playing, playing without a lot of swing thoughts and playing with some confidence.  Those things make it fun to play.   
  
  Q.  You like to switch it up a little bit with some match play?  Is this something you like?  You have done well.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Well, I haven't fared that well in this tournament.  This is as far as I've gotten.  But I've had fun when I've played Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups.  There's only one round that's singles.  This is a different animal.  I think I have an all new respect for tennis pros, because they do this every week, go head-to-head.  And you can play well and get knocked out early.  So I have a whole new respect for those guys and girls.   
  
  Q.  Can you carry over the confidence from today to tomorrow?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, you can.  It's fairly easy to do.  At the same time, everybody who's playing -- everybody who wins their match is gaining some kind of confidence through that.  Yeah, it's pretty easy to carry over from day-to-day, especially in match play.
