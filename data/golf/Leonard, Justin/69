  Q. Playing with Hunter tomorrow morning?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Pretty exciting, being in the second group out there tomorrow?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, we are both excited. You know, we've been practicing together this week, and knowing that we would be playing together, it will be fun to get out there tomorrow morning and get started.   
  
  Q. Excited to jump back in The Ryder Cup and maybe recapture some old glory for the U.S.?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. I probably didn't realize how much I missed this until being back here this week and being involved with this event. Like you said, just looking forward to trying to do what we did in '99.   
  
  Q. And do you worry at all about who you are playing for?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I think we just need to play our own game. Obviously match-play situations come up where you have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing. But you know, just go out and we're going to play our best and hope that it's enough.
