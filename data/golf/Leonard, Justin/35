  Q. With Tiger making that putt, you didn't have to play extra holes, but it was a good match all the way around?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It was. We both had some moments, and I gave Mike a couple of holes and he gave me a couple of holes. But we both hit a lot of good shots out there. We didn't want to go play anymore. You know, this thing, 18 holes, you halve the match. So nice of Tiger to make that putt so we didn't have to trek over to 8 and keep going.   
  
  Q. Obviously all-square, looked like you guys didn't want to go, Tiger was about to do it.   
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, it was probably fitting. We both played well. It was obviously a back and forth match all the way. What can I say? It was kind of tough when we saw, from my perspective, when we saw so much red on the board, we didn't get off to the start we wanted. It was tough.
