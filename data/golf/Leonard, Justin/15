 Q. Eagle at 5 and the nice birdie at 15. Kept telling you where were you all today, didn't it?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. I didn't pay too much attention. I kind of figured I had to make, make another birdie in the last three holes and, you know, had good looks at it 16, 17, I hit two good putts. 
 But, you know, to try and wait until this week to make it through is just -- you know, I mean, come on. I had 25 other weeks to play like this.

 Q. And yet again, you almost got it done. You give yourself a little credit for that.
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. You know, I got a few weeks off now and I'll work on it.

 Q. You going to play some in the fall, do you think?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. I'm going to play three of them, I think.
