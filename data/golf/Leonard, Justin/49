 Q. Justin, for you how did you approach the afternoon where obviously Zach Johnson proved you could fire at a lot of flags. How did you handle the conditions today?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Pretty good. Obviously a totally different wind, a wind that I don't think anybody here is used to seeing very often. 
 So made some holes play quite a bit longer, particularly the tenth hole. Usually you're going into that green with an eight or nine or wedge, and today was 3-iron. 
 So changed some lines a little off the tee, but all in all I played pretty solid.

 Q. Three behind at this point, but you have a lot of holes left to play, too. That should be an advantage here, is it not?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It is. I feel like I've got a couple birdie holes to play in the morning, and then hopefully have some left in the afternoon.
