 Q.  The second round, another great match, another good win for you.  Do you feel like the confidence just has to keep getting better? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah.  I played really good today, and Lee played really good.  We both made, I don't know, six or seven birdies or something.  I hit the ball well.  I got a little sloppy there on 11, 12 and 13.  But made a nice putt at 15 and then a really good putt at 17. 

 Q.  15 and 17, those were kind of what obviously helped you win in the end.  Any turning points early?  Any big shots early on? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Not really.  The biggest turning point, I got to 2-up through 8 and Lee birdied 8 and 9 to get it back even.  And then we both made birdies at 10 and kind of traded pars and made a couple nice up-and-downs.  I think the difference was really making the putt at 15. 

 Q.  Down to the final 16 now; it's got to feel good. 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  It does feel good.  It's nice to win a couple of matches.  And I think I'm finding a little bit of rhythm with match play, as is everybody else, after a couple of days.  So it's good.  There is some good golf being played and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 

 Q.  You're pretty familiar with Stuart (Appleby) through the years? 
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, I've played some Presidents Cups against Stuart.  Obviously he's a great player and playing very well.  So I'm sure it will be another close match.
