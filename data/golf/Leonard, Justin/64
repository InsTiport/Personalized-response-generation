  Q. A very well-played and hard-fought match. Is the glass more half-full or half-empty for you right now?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Well, seeing how we won 17 and lost 18, you know, it was a good halve. I would have loved to made that putt at 18, but you know, both sides played really well today. There was some good golf out there.   
  
  Q. Not playing this afternoon in the four-ball, thoughts on that, and do you wish you could just keep this momentum going perhaps?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Well, I do, but you know what, I'll probably be better off, better served tomorrow with my rest. I told Zinger if he needed me to go, I'd go and if he needed me to sit, I'd sit. That's why we pay him the big bucks.   
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It was really, really good to play with him. He's a fantastic partner. I don't get a chance to make a 5-footer on the last unless he hits a fantastic bunker shot, so great to play with him.  
  
  Q. Finishing with a half-point, you must be pleased?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, very pleased. We both played very solidly, and at the hand, half a point, it looks like something that we really need after they made that birdie on the 17th from five or six meters.   
  
  Q. Are you both feeling a bit of momentum turning towards the Europeans?  
 GRAEME McDOWELL: I think that's the way this Ryder Cup goes. It's momentum for the Reds and it keeps going. I think the pendulum is going to be swung a little bit in either direction so we are going to be going out with all guns blazing this afternoon.
