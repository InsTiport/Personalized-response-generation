  Q.  Tell us about your round.  65, got to be a good day I would think?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, just played really good today, and stayed out of trouble all day long.  I certainly made my short putts, so it was a fun round.   
  
  Q.  What was the biggest difference between today and Thursday?  What did you have working differently?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Well, Thursday I played 13 through 16, 5-over par, and today I played them 3-under par, so there's eight shots right there.   
  
  Q.  Obviously last week you were in contention.  This week you've got two really good rounds.  Are you feeling good about where you're at or do you feel like you maybe missed a chance to even be better?  Are you pretty happy with the way you're playing?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  No, other than those four holes on Thursday, I played okay that round.  And then I played a good, solid round yesterday and obviously played really well today.   
 You know, it would be pretty negative and pessimistic to think what could have happened or what could have been.  I'm pleased with the way I turned things around after a tough start on Thursday, and I'm just trying to keep getting better.   
  
  Q.  Then again, a 65 on this course, as long as it is, with the U.S. Open coming up, that just builds more confidence I would think?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've beaten 75 on this golf course.  You know, it felt like I had one coming.  Yeah, I was glad to play well yesterday so I could see it a couple more times with the U.S. Open coming up.  To shoot a low round today will certainly help my confidence, and I'll write some notes down and remember this one in June.
