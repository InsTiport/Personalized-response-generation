  Q.  Played pretty well?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  I played solid.  I didn't make as many putts as I did yesterday.  You know, I felt like I stalled a little bit there the last 8 holes.   
 If I could have gotten the those putts to go at 12 and 13, I might have gotten another one after that, but, you know, still in pretty good shape.   
 Jesper has got a decent lead but not too many guys to pass to catch them.  That's a good thing.   
  
  Q.  You seemed to be a little more comfortable on the golf course now.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Now than a few months, yeah, definitely.  I can remember when John "McInnis" came over to the putting green to me at the Honda, we were talking and I think that was the 6th putt in a row I missed and come a long ways since then.  Not as far as I'd like to be but I'm getting there.   
  
  Q.  Solid playing.  Good luck this weekend.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD:  Thanks.
