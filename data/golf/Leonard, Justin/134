Q.  You guys really played well, but were you surprised at the mistakes Vijay Singh and Mike Weir made this afternoon?
JUSTIN LEONARD:   Well, this golf course played as tough this afternoon as it played all week.  I made a couple putts early and they had to start pressing a little bit and we got into a rhythm. 


JIM FURYK
Q.  How did the wind change the golf course in your mind, Jim?
JIM FURYK:  Made it a lot tougher.  There's a lot of spots here that when it's calm, you can kind of free-wheel it, let it go a little bit.  But if you just miss a couple fairways or a couple shots left and right a little bit, it can you jump up and bite you with the grass and a lot of hazards out there.
