  Q. 2-under par today, nice start to the round. Can we get some comments?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Just played really well, hit the ball in the fairway quite a bit. This golf course you can't be real aggressive on with the greens the speed they are and fairly firm. So just was able to take advantage of the opportunities and made a few putts and made a nice putt there at the last hole.  
  
  Q. Talk about 15. What really happened? You rebounded on 18 well.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, I hit it in the fairway bunker and just laid up and had a pitching wedge for my third shot, didn't hit a great shot, about 50 feet. Had a good chance of bogeying 15, but that's about it. Nice to get one back there at 18.  
  
  Q. State of your game coming into this week?   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Better than my scores have shown. You know, I've been working very hard and playing pretty well but just not getting the scores out of it. So today it was nice to get out there and make a couple birdies early and be comfortable out there shooting a good score.   
  
  Q. Who are you working with now?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Randy Smith, and I just started working with Marius Filmalter on my putting the last two or three weeks, and he was here yesterday for a little bit, spent some time with him, and I'm encouraged by things.  
  
  Q. What are you guys working on?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Just getting more connected. You know, my stroke had gotten pretty long and loose, so trying to get back in the shoulders. The main thing is gaining confidence and getting comfortable, and I'm doing those two things.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: It was a lot of fun. I played very well, and a couple times I needed to get it up-and-down I was able to do that. It's just nice to come out and shoot a good score the first day and get a little momentum for the rest of the week.
