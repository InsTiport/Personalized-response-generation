  Q. Long time since you've been here. Must feel good.  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it does. Such a beautiful place. You know, great golf course and good people out here, so, yeah, it's nice to be back.  
  
  Q. Changing the format. Nine becomes 18; 18 becomes nine. It's been a long time since you played it, but how does that feel?  
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Um, there's probably a little more excitement here with a reachable par-5. But, I mean, in general, I don't think it makes a huge difference. Both of 'em are great. You have (indiscernible: wind) on either hole, so this works out nicely.   
  
  Q. Just talk about the state of your game right now.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: You know, the last few weeks I played better, but just not scoring very well. So, you know, doing some things to try and improve that, and just really trying to enjoy my time on the golf course.

  Q. Seeing this field, a pretty solid field.   
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah, it is good. I think it's a testament to the tournament here and the golf course, and, you know, guys enjoy coming here.
