   JUSTIN LEONARD: I played a few nice putts, but I missed some pretty makeable putts. Hopefully the next couple rounds I'll get those putts to start going in.

 Q. You've been out here long enough, have been through plenty of delays. How do you deal with it, and what did you do the last couple of days other than playing this morning?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Yeah. You know, it felt like we were out there for a long time today because we only played basically nine holes the first two days or each of the first two days. So, you know, it's nice to get a little bit of rhythm and, you know, just practice a little bit, workout. Nothing special.

 Q. Looking forward to the final two rounds, feel good about your game?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I am, yeah. Everything feels pretty good. Played a few holes this afternoon.
 I'm playing solid, not doing anything really special. Would like to have a few more putts go in.

 Q. What do you think about the way all this has come about? Do you enjoy it or what?
 JUSTIN LEONARD: I enjoy the challenge of it. You know, physically it's not a big -- a huge burden, but just mental, staying in it for any length of time and, you know, it felt strange today playing 18 holes. 
 Played eight or ten holes aside from today, but it's nice to get out there and get the rhythm. And so I'm looking forward to taking a little break and playing tomorrow.

 Q. Like the Ryder Cup session. Back out there. Thank you.
 JUSTIN LEONARD: Sure.
