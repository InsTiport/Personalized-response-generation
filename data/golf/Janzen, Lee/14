  THE MODERATOR:   Three‑under, what was the key out there today?   
LEE JANZEN:   Being on the green a lot.   So I had 15 greens?   Let me think about it.   Yeah, 15 greens, so only missing three greens; unfortunately, the two bogeys I made were dumb, but that's golf.   
The one thing ‑‑ I've worked on a lot of things in my game, but the one stat that needs to improve the most is making putts from 3 feet to 10 feet, in that range.   That seems to be the area the best players in the world are very good at.   
So I have not been doing well this year at that stat, I did better at that today, although I can be better, and that took me down in my score a bit.   
   
 Q.   What are the conditions out there?   
LEE JANZEN:   Good wind, but the course is soft, softest I have seen it in the four years I've been here.   The ball seems to be stopping pretty quick on the green.   The 16 is the only green today, par 3, I hit a 9‑iron and it ran and rolled off the back, and it wasn't a hard tip, so I made bogey, but that's the only time I've seen a ball hit and run.
