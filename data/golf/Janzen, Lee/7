  LEE JANZEN: Drink lots of water, stay in the shade.  Orioles, I wish they could play the Red Sox more.  Those are all good comments. You want comments about my game?  I struggled in every facet of the game today, unfortunately, but that's golf, and you have to learn how to adjust sometimes on the golf course.  Sometimes you can take a round where things aren't going well and turn them around and make it into something.  So, I mean, it could have been worse. I didn't drive it well.  I didn't hit the irons the way I wanted to.  I didn't chip as well as I wanted to, and I had a chance to make some putts, and I didn't do that either.  72 probably isn't all that bad when you consider all of that.  So I'd say I had a great opportunity to overcome some adversity, and I didn't do it.   Q.  You're still in a good position, though?  LEE JANZEN: I'm under par.  5 under is going to be leading, so it's not bad.  I'm not that far back.  I need to play a good round tomorrow, though.  I can't play like I did today.   Q.  When the temperature is going to be down a little bit.  LEE JANZEN: That will be nice.   Q.  Still be able to move around.  LEE JANZEN: Oh, yeah, 90 is -- it was hot today.  I tried to be careful.  Evansville, Indiana, we had a Web.com  event three years ago, it was 108 every day, and it was humid.  I was actually on a three-glove rotation.  I couldn't wear a glove more than two shots in a row because it got that soaked with sweat.  And you can tell I'm not really a huge sweater. So this is really not too bad.  It's warm, and you still have to be careful about the heat.  It is not even -- you know, it's not the hottest I've played in.   Q.  Play well tomorrow.  LEE JANZEN: Thanks a lot.
