Q. You've played Presidents Cup and what that might mean for the International Team?
LEE JANZEN: "Well, it's a tough one for Ernie. He'll be down for the year, but the most important thing for him to do is get a full recovery and be ready for the future of his career. You know, when his career is over, having missed one PGA Championship really doesn't make a huge difference; whether or not he recovers fully will. So I hope he has a great recovery. The TOUR will definitely miss him, but if he recovers fully, he'll be back and be the asset that he is again. But I'm sure the Presidents Cup team is going to miss him a lot, especially on our turf this year."
Q. How much would losing a guy like Ernie hurt, not only just his game, but just his presence and his leadership for an international squad?
LEE JANZEN: "Well, no matter who he is paired with and whoever they are paid up against on the U.S. side, they know they have to play their best to beat him. That's somebody that they don't have to run into out there. Anybody on the Presidents Cup team on either side is going to do their best. I don't know how much of a difference it will make, but I'd rather have Ernie Els on my team than not have him on my team."
