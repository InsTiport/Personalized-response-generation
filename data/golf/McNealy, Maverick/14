Q. Great playing.  Mav, you obviously struggled a bit in the first Walker Cup, what have you learned and taken from that here to get off to such a hot start?
MAVERICK MCNEALY: I actually joked to Doug that I doubled my career Walker Cup point total walking off the 13 green when he lagged that one close with a guaranteed half at least.  But if there are two things I wanted to bring to this team it was, one, an understanding of how this weekend goes and it's a long time, tons of guys just doing everything they can to be on this team, at the forefront of everyone's mind and we're so happy to be here.  But it's really hard to flip that switch Saturday morning.  We had to be ready to go Thursday, Wednesday, and I think we did a really good job of that.  And also it's 72 holes in 36 hours, it's a lot of golf in a short amount of time, it will be over before you know it and we just need to be prepared and ready to go and I think this team was fired up and ready to play three days ago, so.
Q. Doug, you're going to have to build a house in L.A. and move, between these two golf courses you've had an unbelievable summer in this area.  What does this town and city do to bring out the best in your game?
DOUG GHIM: I definitely have good vibes, played really well at Riviera, the golf course suits my eye, but I guess, just coming back here just reminds me of the good play that I had not too long ago.  And when you got nine other guys that are as good as they are and as motivated, and a great captain, there's no, just no more motivation that I need.  Just thankful that it's in L.A. as well.
