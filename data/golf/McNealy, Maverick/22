 Q.  The start of the match wasn?t what you wanted, right?  
MAVERICK McNEALY: ?He was 3-under through seven holes. And I was playing solid and making pars, which is what I did all day. He played phenomenal golf especially at the start. I?m happy with what I did. I did everything I could, unfortunately it wasn?t quite enough. I made a couple of decisions off the tee that I could have done better.?   
 Q.  You close the margin and then he drives the green on 16.  
MAVERICK McNEALY: ?I made a lot of solid pars but he made a lot of great birdies and a great eagle on 16. I did everything I could but it wasn?t enough. But I need to figure out how to make it enough by tomorrow.?
