  BILL HAAS:   Being 6-under I wasn't really striking the ball well.   I chipped in once, made a couple other nice putts.   Obviously the beginning of the day I would be happy with 66.   It's just, you know, you can't do what I did.   Obviously not out of the tournament but, you know, I can't make doubles and expect to win many golf tournaments. 
Pretty disappointing.   I had made an 8-footer for double.   Got to build on that and strike it better tomorrow.

Q.   (Indiscernible).
BILL HAAS:   It's about 40 yards away from the middle of the fairway.   Just a horrible shot.   I hit some horrible shots on the back-9.   I just got away with them.   It caught up to me.   You can't expect to play that poorly, hit that many bad tee shots and get away with it that long.

Q.   Do you freewheel it tomorrow?
BILL HAAS:   Obviously got to be aggressive and the guys are leading are obviously playing well and this is a course that, you know, lot of birdies being made.   So I'm going to have to shoot, you know, some more mid-60s on the weekend.
