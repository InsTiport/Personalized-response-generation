  BILL HAAS:   When it was in the air I thought it was going to be in the left rough, actually.   It was certainly further left than I wanted.   But, yeah, to go up against a tree on a hole where par is a birdie.
So bogey, bogey, and obviously to have it up against the tree on the hardest hole on the course, I kind of saw it coming there. 
I felt like an okay iron on 12, just went over the green.   I felt like I did everything right at 13, went over the green.   You know, happy to make those two birdies on 14 and 15 to make myself feel a little better about things, but, you know, then just compounded the disappointment with bogeys on 17 and 18. 
I don't know, it is what it is.   A similar feeling like I feel like I've felt before coming off 18 here.

Q.   It's tough conditions.   The wind is tricky. 
BILL HAAS:   I found it to be very tricky today.   And obviously there were some good scores.   Better scores today than yesterday.   So I can't say that it was harder than yesterday.   I just didn't execute the shots.
