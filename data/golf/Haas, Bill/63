 Q.   Bill, I know that's not the finish you were looking for.   But still 2‑under par is a pretty decent day.   
BILL HAAS:   Absolutely.   Any round under par around this place is good.   But made some nice putts early, just to keep my round going.   
Then coming down the stretch I hit some nice‑looking irons, didn't get any out of them.   16, I thought I hit it close.   Went just over the green.   17, was 5feet to birdie and 18, I got 7 feet for birdie and 3‑putted.   
Obviously not to make that 4‑putt there, but you've got to make those if you want to stay in contention.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) championship, FedExCup, can you speak a little bit how the course played today?  
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, you know, there's not much wind.   The course was about as good as I think we're going to see it.   
The greens are somewhat holding, if you hit fairway.   Surprising scores aren't a little bit better.   But the course in general is tough.   The greens are‑‑ if you're not hitting the fairways, you can't hardly hit it on them.   And pretty much puts big importance on hitting the fairways for sure.  
   
 Q.   Looked like you had a comfortable pairing there with Zach Johnson.   Good day for you out with there with him?  
BILL HAAS:   Absolutely.   Great guy to play with.   He's always going to play solid.   So that makes you play a little better.   And I think (indiscernible), we'll be out again tomorrow.   So absolutely, good guy to play with.
