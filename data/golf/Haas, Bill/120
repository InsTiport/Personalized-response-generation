 Q. Talk about what it was like out there. 
 BILL HAAS: You know, I didn't make any birdies. I birdied 17 there; it was my only birdie of the day. Maybe lucky to be in the match. And then to go to 18 to give myself a better chance, I needed to hit a better tee shot than that. It's pretty disappointing. 
 Overall, nice to give him a go, I guess, because I think he's one of their best players, but he was beatable today, I guess. I think he gave me an opening and I didn't take it, which is disappointing. But hopefully the team will win, and this won't be a point to worry about. Because that's all that matters; it's a team event, and I've had a ball.

 Q. Just your reaction, your first experience. 
 BILL HAAS: Absolutely, it's been awesome. My record wasn't what I wanted it, but I did enough good things for the week that I'm not too disappointed. There were definitely moments I wished I could do over again, but bogey on 16 from middle of the fairway hurts when I had an opening from him, and 18 here, you have to be able to make a better swing than I did on the tee. 
 So hopefully that's not a sour taste that I'll be thinking about the whole flight home.
