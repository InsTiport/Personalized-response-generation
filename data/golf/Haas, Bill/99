Q.   Tough day, but you kind of came back at the end and finished, almost got yourself back in it.
BILL HAAS:   Overall the way I played yesterday, got off to a nice start today.   Made a couple nice putts.   I really felt good.   Didn't think I could shoot over par, and then all of a sudden to be 4‑over par for the day, just kind of hit me and every shot, I wasn't comfortable, and didn't hit a good shot.   So I deserved it. 
I think under the gun with a three‑shot lead is‑‑ maybe next time I'll handle it better but I know I'll be nervous again.   That's part of the deal but hopefully I can handle it just one shot better, one shot better today I'm in a playoff and two shots better I win the tournament. 
Positives to be taken but overall, you don't get this many opportunities.   A three‑shot lead at one of the best tournaments of the year is great opportunity that I squandered. 

Q.   You hear at times that it's almost harder to protect a lead than go get somebody who is out front, like you said, it's a good learning experience for next time. 
BILL HAAS:   It's easy to second guess every decision I made to make bogey on hindsight.   If I pull the shots off, then they are great.   But maybe the driver at 8 was unnecessary, maybe even driver at 10 was unnecessary. 
Made a terrible shot at 11, those three shots stick out in my head as, if I could do those 3‑over again, maybe it turns out something different.

Q.   Overall for the week, good performance and you're headed into the Match Play with a little momentum? 
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, absolutely.   Even just the last two holes there, to finish birdie, birdie putts at least somewhat of a good taste in my mouth.
