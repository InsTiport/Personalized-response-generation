 Q. Bill, playing with Nick, you have pretty similar games, do you hit the ball the same distance or basically the same distance? 
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, pretty similar distances off the tee. He might be a touch longer. We are good pals and play a lot of practice rounds together. Played this week, having a practice round together, so we definitely feel comfortable with each other and hopefully we can both perform pretty well and give them a good match. 

 Q. Obviously Charl won the Masters must be exciting for you. 
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, absolutely. It's a very difficult task at hand, but me and Nick are a good team. I think the odds-makers probably put us as the underdog but that's a good challenge and more reason to win.
