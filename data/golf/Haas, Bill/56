  BILL HAAS:   Certainly around this place you have fond memories and just to play with the guy with the Jacket, with all the history he has here, it was a special two rounds for me, for sure.   
  
 Q.   What has he meant to Augusta National, to the National championship?  
BILL HAAS:   I mean he embodies gentlemen.   Our young people should look more to guys like him as opposed to maybe some of our young stars.   I feel like‑‑ I feel like I was raised the way‑‑ he's the kind of guy I want to be when I get older.  
So for what he's done for the Augusta that's for everyone else to say.   But he embodies great golf, gentleman of the game.   And somebody I aspire to be like.  
  
 Q.   What was that like walking up 18 when he got that ovation?  
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, it was awesome.   Gives you chills, you know, walking up 18 and everybody standing up.   And he's tearing up out there.   And pretty special moment for him and just to be a part of it was neat to me, something I'll always remember.   
  
 Q.   You're 10 back, but you're in the top‑10.   Can this thing flip and can you be in the middle of it?  
BILL HAAS:   You never know.   I'm still going to have to play lights out.   I played pretty nice to be 4‑under, honestly.   I don't see myself getting to 14, but then again I can't say I can't.   Somebody's done it.   And that's the only thing I have to keep telling myself is that even though Jordan is an unbelievable player, and he's really hot right now, it's doable.   And that's the mentality I have to have.   If I go out and play nice I can maybe catch him.   But we'll probably need some help from him.
