Q.   Always a crap shoot out here with match play, but how happy are you to survive and advance to Thursday?
BILL HAAS:   I'm very pleased.   It's actually my first time out of the first round.   Got some fortunate breaks there at the end, made two nice pars after hitting it in the desert.   Could have gone either way on those last couple to make the match go longer.   Overall, early, I was playing pretty solid, so that felt good.

Q.   How do you try to maintain optimism?   As you said, not a whole bunch of success here.   How do you try to realize you are always still in it until you are not?
BILL HAAS:   I do think that I can compete out here.   Just try to play your best and hopefully it's good enough to move on. 
Like I said, being the first time out of the first round, I was very optimistic.   It can only get better.   I don't know, you have to somehow be positive.   You can't write yourself off before you tee up or you never have a chance.

Q.   Breaking through with that wind, how can that help confidenceâ€‘wise moving forward?
BILL HAAS:   It shows that it can be done if you play solid golf.   Looking forward to the opportunity tomorrow to hopefully move on a couple of more matches.
