  BILL HAAS:   One in the water at 15 cost me at least 2 there on that hole.   Overall for two rounds I feel like I'm playing somewhat solid.   It helps playing with Zack and Jordan.   They both played great so I was trying to keep up with them.  
   
 Q.   A around like this, how is this going to help your confidence over the weekend?  
BILL HAAS:   Been playing somewhat solid here for most of the year, little bit ups and downs.   But I have a swing thought that seemed to be working pretty good so just keep going with that.   Hopefully putt pretty good on the weekend.   Just hopefully the guys in front don't go crazy.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised at the play that Jordan can do?   
BILL HAAS:   To do what he's done already this year only a few guys have ever made it on the Tour the way he's making it out here and to win as a rookie, and I'm not surprised at all.   Played with him a few times.   He's a great player.   So, I'm hoping he doesn't keep playing like this this weekend.
