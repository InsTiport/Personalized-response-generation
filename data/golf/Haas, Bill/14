BILL HAAS: I start and lost my first match.  In the old format I would be going home.  Luckily, with this round-robin format, I was able to get a couple wins.  Wait around for the playoff, and certainly made it interesting in the playoff and nice to move on.
Q. You probably haven't had a look at this yet, so I'm going to show you.  This was for you crucial.  You're feed were in the hazard.
BILL HAAS: It was the only place I could drop unless I wanted to drop it in the bunker.  Basically just trying to get it close.  I knew he had a pretty decent look at birdie.  I wanted to make him at least two-putt to win the match.  For that ball to go in, it was a lot of luck.
Q. When you look at things like that, little moments, can you let yourself think, you know what, I kind of thought I was out, maybe this is going to be my week?
BILL HAAS: Absolutely.  I think if you look back at most guys weeks when they win, something good happens.  A good break here or there.  That certainly could be it.  I'm just pleased to be going on, try to go home and get some rest.  Got to win the match in the mourning to get going in the afternoon.  Just take it hole by hole.  Very cliche, but I'm looking forward to it tomorrow morning.
Q. You've got your head around potentially going four more times?
BILL HAAS: I think you have to.  You can't go the fourth one unless you win that first one.  You have got to focus on -- I've got Kevin Na in the morning.  He's been playing some good golf.  He'll be a tough opponent.
