  Q.  Good start to the week?   
  HAAS:  I'm very pleased with how I played. I made six birdies each day. Shoot, if you make six birdies in every round, you are guaranteed to do something decent. If you are making birdies, it frees up those tee shots a little bit. Takes a little less pressure off them.   
  
  Q.  Are you ready to step it up on the weekend?   
 BILL HAAS:  I haven't been pleased with what I've done on the weekend. But the more chances I have, the better I'll get. Hopefully, this week is a stepping stone for me.   
  
  Q.  Enjoying the week?   
 BILL HAAS:  I'm having a good time. The resort is nice, the beach is great. It's one of those weeks that even if you don't play well, at least you are going to have a good time. So far, it has been doubly-nice.   
  
  Q.  Feel good about your game heading into the weekend?   
 BILL HAAS:  It's all been pretty good so far. It's all off the tee out here. Iron shots you can miss them a little bit. The greens are so nice here you can get up and down pretty easily. It's all about getting it off the tee here and hopefully I can keep driving it good.
