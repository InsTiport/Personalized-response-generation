BILL HAAS: I didn't maybe have it, especially middle of the round.  Toward the back nine, towards the end, I started hitting some little bit better shots.
But all in all, I kind of hung in there.  It wasn't the best of days ball-striking-wise, so anything under par around this place is good I think.
Q. You're certainly not the only one.  There are several players today that just stalled a little IN the round.  It's tricky out there.
BILL HAAS: I mean, it's a hard golf course.  There's a bunch of shots where if you don't hit the correct shot, you can make double real quick.  I feel like I'm playing defensively on some tee shots, and therefore, that can hurt you some.
Hideki is playing beautiful.  He's going to be hard to catch tomorrow.  But if I can go shoot four or five, and then hopefully he falls back.
Q. Is there a consolation that, yes, you've lost some ground on him, but it's not much.  You're very nicely placed.
BILL HAAS: If I had shot over par, I'd shoot myself out of it.  Just to kind of hang in there, and I really wanted to make the birdie on the last to stay within four.  Which it's still tough to make up -- five shots is going to be really difficult tomorrow.  You know, happy to be in this position and hopefully tomorrow I can do something decent.
Q. When you say it's going to be difficult, because we all appreciate how well he's playing, but it's not insurmountable, is it?  You can see the scores there?
BILL HAAS: If he shoots 2-over, which you're seeing a lot of plenty of high scores, and if I shoot 3-under, we're tied right there.
Actually Russell Knox was playing as good as any of us, so I think he'll be just as tough to catch.  It's going to take a low number, but like I said, I think this course, I've not shot many low numbers on this place.  So to be doing something positive every day, I'm very pleased.
