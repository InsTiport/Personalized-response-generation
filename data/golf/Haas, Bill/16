 Q.  Couple quick comments on getting the win and obviously you have got to wait around a little while now before you get back out there?  Probably rather go now with the momentum.  
BILL HAAS: Right now I'd like to go play, play the next hole before the playoff.  But I do get it that they want everyone that is involved with the playoff to be playing, number one.  And it does make sense to wait until all the tee times are teed off.  So I totally get it.  After losing the match the first day, happy to be here.  So got a chance still, so happy to win this match and give myself an opportunity.   
 Q.  Any key moments out in this match particularly?  
BILL HAAS: I bogeyed the 2nd hole but then after that I didn't make a bogey.  He made to make birdies to beat me.  I was talking with my caddie that he might have had an instance of he felt like no matter what happens today, I got a playoff.  So maybe he was holding back a little bit and he didn't make many birdies.  So I was able to take advantage of that.  Hopefully I can move on.  We'll see.   
 Q.  Slight change in conditions.  
BILL HAAS: This is pretty gross.  Little bit of rain.  We were expecting to be pulled off the course at some point, but lucky enough, we were able to play a bunch.  I'm not sure if -- there wasn't as much wind.  There was some breeze to contend with.  Yesterday blowing 30 at times.  Certainly more benign conditions other than the rain.
