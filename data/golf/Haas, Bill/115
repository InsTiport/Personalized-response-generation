Q.   Talk about your round today and some highlights. 
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, I birdied 16 and 18 to finish off the round, which were huge.   Didn't get 11 or 17, which were downwind, and I think everybody was pretty much birdieing those.   To not get those but then to get the two more difficult holes is a good feeling. 
I'm in a good position for tomorrow.   I don't know what the leaders are going to do coming in here, but I'll be in striking distance.   It's going to take 4‑ or 5‑under tomorrow, but you never know.   I don't know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, but if it's going to be like this it'll take 4‑ or 5‑under.

Q.   Were you expecting to be in this position after the first round?
BILL HAAS:   Thursday I didn't have nearly my best stuff.   I made some really nice par saves just to hang in there and shoot 1‑over.   Very pleased with that.   And then I had a good finish to yesterday's round.   I birdied four of my last six, kind of on the cut line, but then went from that to being in the tournament, which is something you can do around this place.   Hopefully tomorrow I can just‑‑ if you can drive it well around here, you can hopefully keep yourself out of trouble.   Just drive it good tomorrow and see what happens.

Q.   What are you happiest with right now?
BILL HAAS:   You know what, putting feels pretty good, which is something we're never happy with.   I've got to give my putter a lot of credit this week just to be where I am, and hopefully tomorrow the driver and the irons will feel just as good.
