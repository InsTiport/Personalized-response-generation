Q. Bill, very nice 67 today.  Seemed like the new putting method was working nicely for you.
BILL HAAS: Yeah, got to give all the credit today to the putter for sure.  It's exciting because if I can keep putting like that then I can really do something good this weekend.
But I got to drive it better.  My good ones are good, but then I've hit some foul balls.  I'm getting lucky; 17 I hit one way right and it hit a tree and kind of kicked out.
So I think tomorrow if I can be a little sharper off tee I think I can have a good finish.  I might be too far back, but nice to shoot a good one today to give myself at least that chance.
Q. You need 48 FedExCup points to retain your card after that minor medical.  How much is that playing into your mind?  Does it help or hinder you?
BILL HAAS: I think if I focus on that then it hinders you.  I just got to go focus on the first tee tomorrow and go from there.  My game all year is put myself in this position.  At the same time, I am focused on that because, sure, it would be great to get the status back.
At the same time, I got the rest of this year as well.  I'm certainly not going to hang my future on tomorrow's round.  I think I got to just take it as it comes, and hopefully I can keep scrambling the way I'm scrambling, or just hit it better it'll be a fun, easy round tomorrow.
