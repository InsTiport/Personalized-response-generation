 Q.  The NCAA basketball tournament, the key to winning that, you got to make a buzzer beater, survive a couple of sketchy matches.  I would say you've been surviving over the last 24 hours or so.  Just playing good enough to squeak through.  Maybe we haven't seen your best golf yet?  
BILL HAAS: Obviously, I have seen that Jon Rahm has won every match, 6 & 5, 5 & 4.  I certainly have not done that.  Like you said, you have got to play one shot better than your opponent.  I hung in there today.  Kevin didn't play bad.  I don't think I made a bogey, so I didn't give him a hole.   
 Q.  Speaking of players that have won by comfortable margins, Phil Mickelson, who you will be facing here in a just a few moments.  
BILL HAAS: Yeah, I should have mentioned Phil because I'm playing him.  He's certainly playing very well.  His short game, he's never out of a hole.  I certainly can't be spraying it out there if I want to contend with him.   
 Q.  How would you gauge the way you played this morning?  
BILL HAAS: I'm okay.  I think I made five birdies, no bogeys.  Overall, in a stroke play event that would be very good.  But Phil is winning by big margins, so I'm assuming he's making a lot of birdies out there.  I certainly can't be scrambling around if I want to beat him.  Looking forward to it.  He's a guy I look up, so just to play him will be a lot of fun.   
 Q.  What is the dynamic going to be like between the two of you this afternoon?  
BILL HAAS: I think it will be good.  Me and him both want to win.  We'll certainly be chatty at times but other times when we're grinding out there, it will be business as usual.  So like I said, looking forward to it.  It's going to be a lot of fun.
