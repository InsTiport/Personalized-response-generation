 Q.   It seemed as if it was a nonissue today the imperfections os on 4, 11, and 12.   Did you feel that way?   Was there any, did you have any humps and bumps that come to mind?  
BILL HAAS:   Luckily, I played pretty solid and the putts that I hit, none of them ‑‑ the 9th hole, sure, I would love to blame it on the bad greens, but I might have pushed that a little bit.   
But other than that, the putts I felt like I should make, I did, and no, but to answer your question, the greens are much better than the way they talked about them coming in.   
   
 Q.   Any other remarks?  
BILL HAAS:   What do you think, William?   Greens are pretty good?   Not as good as usual?  
(Referring to his son.)  
(Laughter.)  
He didn't see them last year.   
(Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Are conditions out there this afternoon, the greens are obviously soft, the wind pick up a little bit?  
BILL HAAS:   The greens are softer than normal, so I think that's why you're seeing the good scores.   Because, sometimes, if you drive it in the rough, you can still hit the green.   That's the big defense around this place, when those greens get firm and fast, it's very difficult.   
So you'll see, if they stay soft you'll keep seeing good scores, but I think as the week goes on they will tuck some pins and the scoring will go up a little bit.   
But, yeah, the slower greens and not as firm is the big reason the scores are good.   The wind picked up, but it always blows a little here, I don't think you're ever going to get away from it.   10 to 15 is not blowing that hard.   That's kind of what we got this afternoon.   
It was very playable.   As you saw, Martin shot 9‑under, so it was very playable, I thought.
