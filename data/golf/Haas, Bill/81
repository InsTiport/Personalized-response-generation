Q.   Just got done talking to Adam Scott and he said that they played well enough to where they at least deserved a halve, because you played really well, just a really well‑played match. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, they were tough opponents.   Bill and I played great golf today, made plenty of birdies.   But it's hard to win matches when every hole they have got good birdie looks, and what Hideki did on the last hole was a great shot.

Q.   You had a nice round, as well; rolled in a couple long ones. 
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, made some nice putts.   Putting is difficult in this format, when you've got a lot riding on every putt, every hole is a big deal, and it was nice to obviously go 1‑up there on 17. 
We knew we needed 3 on 18, and we just didn't hit the shot we needed to hit to win the match out right, but a half a point is good against two of the best players in the world.
