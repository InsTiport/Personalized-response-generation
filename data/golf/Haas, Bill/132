  BILL HAAS: Yeah, anything under par on this place is really good.   
 I was just saying I wanted to hang on, there's so many holes that you can make a big number on, and I just got off to a nice start, birdied the first three holes out of the gate, that kind of comforts you, and I was hanging on the rest of the day.   
 Unfortunately made a bogey coming in to shoot 2-under it, but like I said, I'll be happy with anything under par every day the rest of the week.   
  
  Q. Are you comfortable with these bermudagreens in the weather conditions?  
 BILL HAAS: I grew up even in the south on bent greens, but these are so much nicer. I wish I had grown up on these because these are so much nicer than any bent can grow down here, just because it gets so hot. Probably the best-conditioned course we have ever played.   
  
  Q. Talk a little about just the overall round, is the course playing a bit shorter than you expect it will be from the practice rounds?  
 BILL HAAS: I guess in the practice round, you play every back tee, just to play it, and I thought they did a great job of moving a few tees up. Just because it only makes it fair. Some of these tee boxes are pretty much too long, I think. And so if you're going to play some of those holes real long, then maybe you move up a couple shorter to make up for that.   
 I thought they did a great job. I thought it played about the number it should play.   
  
  Q. Did you think a 63 was out there?  
 BILL HAAS: I didn't. We were talking about that coming down the stretch, and I see Jerry Kelly is 5-under, also.   
 So anything 3- or 4-under is -- definitely if he's going to keep doing that, he's the man to beat. That's a very good score, very impressive.
