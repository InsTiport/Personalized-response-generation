 Q. You had it going early. 
 BILL HAAS: Yeah. Birdied 8, 9, to go to 3-under for the day which was nice. Somewhat watching the board, I know I'm grinding to make the cut. And I guess at some point you got to quit thinking about that and turn 1-under into 3-under as opposed to hanging in there. 
 But made a couple bogeys. Bogeyed 13 after a poor tee shot. 
 And then came back and made 3 on 14 which was huge. 
 And a terrible iron at 15, but I was basically limping in and happy to par the last couple. 
 I hit two good iron shots into 17 and 18 and wasn't able to make birdies there, but was able to hit some, make it stress-free there when I was on the cut line basically. 

 Q. To grind it out like you did in a Major like this what's that like?
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, it's hard. Every shot, that 17th tee shot's hard when you're on the cut line. You can't miss that tee shot. And I feel very fortunate because I definitely don't have it. It's not like I'm not -- it's not clicking on all cylinders right now. 
 So I grinded my way to even par and very pleased with that. And I might go hit a couple here, just see if I can't think of something for tomorrow. And there's a chance that, you know, couple under each day this weekend and move, I pass everybody. So -- not everybody, it doesn't win, but it, you know, it would be a good finish in a Major, so.
