  Q. Nice start to the season; no bogeys out there.   
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, today was so pretty at times. I made a nice par at 9, the par-5, actually drove it in the hazard right, which you just can't do, made a nice par there. Then got it going on the back nine. Not many long par putts. I definitely didn't hit it very close today but a lot of nice lag putts and got lucky and chipped one in on 14 there and made eagle. Little things like that helped today's round. I need to be a little sharper maybe, but I can't complain about 68.  
  
  Q. I'm sure you've heard the stories about the wind and everything out here. How was it out there with very little wind?  
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, definitely very little wind. It's a different -- I feel like I've been here since Sunday and every day it's blown a little bit different direction, which messes with you a little bit. But yeah, I'm happy. I hope it stays like this all week. I know it won't, but I look forward to the challenge of wind out here. The course is set up for wind so you can do it if it blows. But like I said, if you hit a few mis-hits, when the wind is blowing that's when it really amplifies those shots.  
  
  Q. Having fun out here?  
 BILL HAAS: Absolutely. When you're mad about a missed putt or something like that you just pinch yourself and look out. It's pretty sweet being able to start here.
