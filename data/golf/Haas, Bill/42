BILL HAAS: I said something to Zach about, man, I hope you guys go out and dust them this morning so it doesn't come down to me.  He said, that's what you've got to want.  You've got to want to be in that position.
It wasn't pretty.  I might have been even par or 1-under, so it certainly wasn't a ball-striking day for either of us.  But down the stretch, I hit some nice shots.  I felt for Sangmoon there on the last hole; he was grinding hard and you could feel the energy of the crowd.
I was fortunate that I had a few good bounces early and allowed me to get a couple up early.  I hung in there.  That was the hardest position I've felt on the golf course in my career.  So it feels good to hang on and hit some good shots down the stretch.
Q. And you were a captain's pick, and your dad is the captain and you were the anchor match.  You were cool all week long and didn't let emotions come out.  What's going on for you now?
BILL HAAS: Hard to explain.  Certainly love to be here.  I can't even talk about it really.  It was a goal of mine all year was to make this team and I shouldn't even be getting emotional.  It's just golf.  But to be in that team room with all those guys, it means a lot to me.
