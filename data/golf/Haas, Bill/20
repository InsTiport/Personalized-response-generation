Q. 10-under par lots of time is good enough to win week to week.  Seems like Kim was like in a another stratosphere?
BILL HAAS: Yeah.  He's obviously playing great golf.  I thought if I got off to a good start today I could have maybe caught him but he got off to a good start as well.  So, he's pretty much uncatchable for me.  I kind of felt like I was playing for a Top-5 or something like that.  Then just didn't play well coming down the stretch.  Disappointed on today but overall, 10-under par, I got to try to take the positives.
Q. Momentum such a big thing in sports.  Do you feel like you have some momentum heading into the Playoffs?
BILL HAAS: Yeah.  You try not take too much into one day.  I think whatever momentum I had I felt like I lost it today but, then again, we all start back at even again next week.  So, just got to go try to play good golf next and try to build on that.
Q. Excitement for the whole FedExCup, it really has picked up a tremendous amount of momentum and fans now understand how it all works.  Do the players really look forward to the Playoffs?
BILL HAAS: I think so.  There's a lot to play for.  I mean getting in the Tour Championship does a lot for your career and that's kind of the goal, I think.
If you make it to the Tour Playoff I'm living proof anything can happen at East Lake.  You got to try to play good golf for three weeks and hopefully find yourself in that Top 30.
Q. People still ask you about that shot out of the pond or water?
BILL HAAS: Yeah.  It's one of my things I'm recognized about with golf, which I'm happy about.  Big moment for me in golf for sure.  The way it all went down that year was great.  It's motivated me to try to get back there because the feeling I had that day, you know, has been unequaled on the golf course.  Trying to find that again.
