Q.     Two eagles in a round.   What's up with that?
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, it was nice.   Kind of got off to a shaky start.   Made a nice par putt at 11 and a nice par at 12, one of the harder holes out here.   Then from then on I hit some nice shots. 
Obviously the hole-out on 13 -- or 14, got me going and then two nice shots at 15 and a nice putt, and then birdied 17 to get it to 5-under through 8 holes. 
I was kind of thinking something really good, and to shoot 5-under, even par on the last ten maybe a little bit frustrating but overall it's nice to shoot a good number.

Q.   You had I think was it like 175 on 14?   What did you hit?
BILL HAAS:   7-iron.

Q.   About right, 175?
BILL HAAS:   That's about right.

Q.   You're feeling good about your position heading into the weekend.
BILL HAAS:   I think the scores are pretty good.   Obviously I think the rough -- when you miss fairways it's hard to make par so I can just keep it in the fairway, you know, you can give yourself a lot of birdie chances.
