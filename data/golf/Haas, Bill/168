 Q.  So you played pretty well today.  How many holes did you get in? 
 BILL HAAS:  13. 

 Q.  And you were 7-under through 13? 
 BILL HAAS:  8 total, so 4 today. 

 Q.  Was it part of the plan?  Did you know going into it that you weren't going to get finished? 
 BILL HAAS:  I think I knew that we were going to play 12 or 13 holes, and it is what it is.  I would have liked to play when it was warmer out, but it's no big deal.  Maybe tomorrow I'll get off to a good start and I'll go into my next round. 

 Q.  Are you hoping for another frost delay so you can start when it's a little warmer, or does cold not bother you too much? 
 BILL HAAS:  I'd rather play -- the warmer the better.  But I'm sure it's been like that every morning, and unless it stays warm tonight, which it doesn't feel like it's going to -- 

 Q.  So the course was scoring today? 
 BILL HAAS:  Yeah, I don't know why it was different than yesterday.  There wasn't much wind either day.  I just think maybe people saw red numbers and started going low, I don't know.
