  Q. Great way to finish the round with a birdie at 18, which is a very difficult hole. That makes you feel good, doesn't it?  
 BILL HAAS: Absolutely. After 5 and 17, yeah, you don't want to come in with two bogeys or anything like that. So anything par or better on 18 is great, but that was a bonus to make that putt.  
  
  Q. A solid day for you, don't you think?  
 BILL HAAS: I really feel like I played nice honestly. It could have been a little better. Two of my bogeys were from the fairway, and I missed pretty makeable putts. Could have easily been 3- or 4-under, but I'm very pleased with 2-under out here.  
  
  Q. Charles played well. You guys both played off each other a little bit?  
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, he doesn't ever seem to miss a shot. He's a nice partner to play with. He's a great guy and is very steady. You know he's going to be playing solid out there, so it helps to be playing with a guy like him.  
  
  Q. Do you like this golf course?  
 BILL HAAS: I think so. It's all right there in front of you. Even though it's been revamped a little bit over the years, it's got that old school feel to it, even though it plays pretty long. So yeah, you've got to make putts. The greens are tough. They're playing fast right now, so if you miss fairways and can't get them on the right side of the greens, it gets pretty tough.
