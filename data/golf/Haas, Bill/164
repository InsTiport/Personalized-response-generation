  Q. Long day today, got a long day tomorrow. How do you feel heading into Sunday?  
 BILL HAAS: I feel pretty good. Just get out of here, try to get some rest, a little food tonight. And the last time this happened I was on the same hole starting tomorrow. I'll be on 11 green.  
 I came out and played pretty well the other day when we started. Hopefully have some good mojo for me.  
  
  Q. You're going to have to play catch up and on a long day. Is that forcing you to be more aggressive or more strategical, more patience, tell me?  
 BILL HAAS: I think you have to be aggressive out there. You see guys shooting 7, 8-under this round. I'm only 2 as of now, I'm getting lapped, and it's going to take, I would say, 65 one day and then the next round, probably lower to have a chance to win.   
 I'm just hoping to come out tomorrow and play solid. Things feel good right now and hopefully the putter will, too.  
  
  Q. Are you okay with the position to go out and play or unsatisfied?  
 BILL HAAS: I'm okay with that, the more golf we got in today. More daylight gives us more time to maybe re-pair tomorrow. Hopefully, we'll be able to do that and I think it's supposed to be a nice day tomorrow so hopefully we'll have plenty of daylight to do everything.
