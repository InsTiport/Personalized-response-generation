BILL HAAS: Thomas didn't play his best, maybe, and missed a couple of putts that he could have made.  I think I was still hovering around even par today.  These are pretty tough conditions, it's somewhat windy.  But the putter kept me in it.   
But the one guy I cannot hit like this against is Adam Scott.  I'm going to have to play better going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  You guys are playing each other in tomorrow in Friday's third day here at the Dell Match Play.  You have two points and he has one and a half points.  The two of you are going to go after it tomorrow.  You have the advantage, because if you halve the match, you advance to Saturday's Sweet 16.  How will you play it strategically?  
BILL HAAS: I certainly don't wanted it to come down to the last hole, being a PLAYERS champion, a Masters champion.  Coming down the last hole he has that advantage, even though I have that half point.  Certainly if I can just putt the ball nice and just somehow get the ball a little more in the fairway I can put some pressure on him.   
But that's what you want, you want to play the best guys.  And he's probably playing better than anybody in the world right now.  And it's fun for me tomorrow.
