 Q. Pretty good way to start, pretty good way to finish here. Played well last week, feels like you're on a roll. 
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, maybe a little bit. I feel like I have my swing going, and it feels pretty good. Didn't feel as good the last couple of days in Augusta. And here it feels okay. I'm just kind of working on it and feeding off of some good finishes this year. If you bury the first and last every day it's good.

 Q. We talked about this place before, it has to be one of your favorite places to come every year?
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, absolutely. I've never played that great here, scoring-wise, but it's definitely a week that that's kind of -- you want to play well. You feel good, positive, coming in here every year. But it's one of those weeks coming because you can drive down here, you have a lot of family and friends coming out. It's where my parents met. The reason I'm alive is because of this place. 
 I hope they get a new sponsor next year.
