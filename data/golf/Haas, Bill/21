 Q.  Pretty good play for the first three rounds.  Got to feel good about yourself and your position going into the Championship Sunday.  
BILL HAAS: Yeah, I do.  I'm going to be five, six shots back which is not a spot you want to be and especially on a course where the leaders are probably not going to come backwards.   
The way the conditions are, the golf course, there's just too many good scores.  So I probably have maybe a little bit too much ground to make up.  Lot to play for if I can go out and shoot 5, 6, 7-under tomorrow, at least put some pressure on those guys and also maybe try and have a good finish.   
 Q.  What's different about the way the course has played today compared to Thursday and Friday?  
BILL HAAS: I don't know.  The opposite wind direction.  It's blowing like three miles per hour.  It didn't blow the first few days that much, either.  Through 6 holes I was 1-under and I think I saw on the leaderboard I lot of 27 spots.  The scores were just good today.  Guys were making putts.  The pins were maybe a little more accessible.  Other than that, lot of guys making a lot of putts.   
 Q.  For a tournament is it exciting to know the guys can come out of nowhere for contention building tomorrow guys 11, 12, 13-under, the leader might be 15, 16, if he gets off to a quick start early he's right in the mix.  
BILL HAAS: If you get a slow start you got too much ground to make up tomorrow.  Going to have to try to hit the fairway on 1, hit the green and make the putt and go from there.
