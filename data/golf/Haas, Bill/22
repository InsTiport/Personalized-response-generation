Q. Good round for you, Bill, going into tomorrow.  What do you like about what you were able to accomplish out there today?
BILL HAAS: Yeah.  I mean anytime you give one back late, I was 5-under and finished 4, so that's certainly disappointing but a little bit of motivation to hopefully get off to a good start tomorrow and keep going low.
So, certainly didn't shoot myself out of the golf tournament so felt like I did some good things and hopefully can shoot three more like that.
Q. What do you feel like you can improve upon tomorrow morning with the guys switching up from afternoon to morning group?
BILL HAAS: In the morning typically the ball is going pretty far out there, it was hot.  In the morning you have some wet grass, maybe some dew, the ball won't be going quite as far.  The greens might be a little bit more receptive.  The lowest scores from today were in the morning so hopefully tomorrow we'll get a little bit of that as well.
