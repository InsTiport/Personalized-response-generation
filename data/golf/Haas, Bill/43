Q. Just talk about the match in general.
BILL HAAS: The match, it was hard fought.  There wasn't a ton of birdies.  But me and Kuch, I missed about a 4-footer for par on 13 was our first bogey, and gave him a hole there.  That might be the difference maker.  You can't look at it that way, but I hit a poor iron at 16, and then Kuch gave me a putt and I happened to make one there to keep us all-square.
And then we won 17, which was huge.  Certainly a better feeling coming up 18 with a 1-up lead than all-square.  But I'm not disappointed with the execution of my shot into 18.  I was really liking my second shot and it just carried a hair too far.  Really, I thought it could go over, but I thought really with a 1-up lead just over this green was a great spot to be.  Hats off to Hideki because he played a great second shot.
Q. Be ready for Sunday's singles?
BILL HAAS: Yeah, I just heard I'm not playing the afternoon, which is hard to be disappointed when you look at the guys that are going out.  I mean, they are the top guys in the world.  I'm just going to enjoy watching them and hopefully we have a good afternoon session, because it looks like we are going to lose our second session in a row.  We'll need a good afternoon before the singles.
