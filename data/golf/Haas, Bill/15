 Q.  About an hour ago, I didn't think I was going to do a winner's interview with you.  You looked like you were dead from the 2nd hole and you chipped in from about 40 yards.  Tell me about it.  
BILL HAAS: When the ball is in the air, your first initial thought is it's over.  Then again it was hooking enough off that right slope on the ride side of the fairway that I knew I was going to get to drop somewhere close to the green and at least make him two-putt is my idea.  Halfway there when that ball was rolling, I said, I think I made it.  That was sweet.   
It wasn't the prettiest of playoffs.  A bunch of pars.  Luckily he missed a couple of putts from me.   
 Q.  Kevin Na coming up on Saturday here.  
BILL HAAS: He's a heck of an opponent.  Doesn't miss many fairways or many greens.  It's one of those things where you have to play well to beat him.  I don't think he's going to give it to you.
