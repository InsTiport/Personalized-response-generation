Q. Bill, 66 today, 4-under, minus 9. Certainly in mix on the weekend. Two back. Your thoughts on how you played today?
BILL HAAS: I played good today. I made some nice saves. 18, middle of the fairway and missed the green with a 9-iron. That hole, give a 9-iron in your hand you got to do better than that. I chipped it about 6 feet and made a nice par save. 
I made three nice 5-footer par saves today which you miss those and I'm back in the middle of the pack. So, hung in there nice and hopefully tomorrow -- I feel pretty good with my game. Hopefully tomorrow I can keep going and hopefully those leaders don't go crazy.

Q. There were three opportunities inside ten feet, maybe 9 on the backside that you just grazed the edge.
BILL HAAS: That was the difference I mean yesterday and today maybe. I did make those nice par saves but I had a couple nice looks, one at 17, one at 14 that certainly were very makeable, I wish I could get back. You know, very happy to be in the mix, be hopefully a couple back starting tomorrow and, you know, you're going to need the make birdies. It will be a fun weekend.

Q. What was it like playing the ball down today? I know 17 you had an awful lie in the fairway.
BILL HAAS: Big divot in the fairways. I was surprised we didn't get crazy too bad of mud. I did have a couple mud on a couple holes, the 11th hopefully had a little bit of mud. The ones that have some valleys in them getting a little bit of mud. As much as they've dried up hopefully by tomorrow it shouldn't be an issue at all.
