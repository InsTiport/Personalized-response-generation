  Q. Six birdies out there. What went well for you out there?   
 BILL HAAS: Was it six? I thought it was just five. I think I only made one bogey, right? Oh, I made an eagle and three birdies and a bogey, only one bogey.   
 But no, I got off to a good start. Eagled the first hole, which is a nice way to start any round, and then made about a ten-footer for par on the second hole. Could have been a lot worse there starting out, and was fortunate to be a couple under through 2 and just fed off that.  
  
  Q. Conditions today were pretty nice. The next two days forecast isn't very good. How important do you think it is to get off to a good start?   
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, I mean, if I was 2-over right now I wouldn't like the forecast. Nobody likes the forecast anyway but we've all got to play in it, and I was fortunate to shoot a good round when it was nice.  
  
  Q. Are there any games you like to play with your buddies when you're just out there having fun?  
 BILL HAAS: I think there's always maybe a small wager on some practice rounds and stuff like that. But I think I fun one is no birdies, the guy has to pay up, and if he makes no bogeys then he gets a little bit of money, too. Just to kind of -- at the end of the day coming down the last couple holes to make a birdie would make it a big deal.  
  
  Q. We talked to your father and he said that growing up you guys didn't really gamble too much but he'd say I'll give you a shot or two and you didn't want to do that.   
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, we never gambled growing up, only because I didn't have any money to gamble with and I would lose it anyway. But we definitely had some -- coming down the stretch I would know where he stood and he knew where I stood because I was trying to beat him.
