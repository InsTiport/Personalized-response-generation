   BILL HAAS: I know it's tough out there. I made a couple of dumb mistakes, but overall really pleased. Birdie on 18 a nice way to finish. 
 This is my first go around this place. I played a practice round and a pro-am yesterday, but I'm still kind of learning a few things about it. The one thing I do know is you have to hit it in the fairways. If you don't hit it in the fairway then you're not going to shoot under par. Hopefully I can keep driving it decent and post a couple good scores this week.
