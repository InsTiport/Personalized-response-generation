Q.   3‑under, talk about how the round went if you would, please. 
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, I got off to a lucky start.   I teed off when it was still pretty nasty, and just missed the green.   Actually I hit it left in the trees off the tee and it kicked out in the fairway and I just missed the green and I chipped it in to make birdie.   So turned an easy bogey into a birdie there to get me going, and birdied 4 and 5, as well.   So got off to a nice start, 3‑under through five. 
Even though that sounds like I was cruising, I bogeyed 14 and 15 and had 16 and 17 coming up.   So I was feeling good near the lead and then all of a sudden I was on the cut line and made a nice par save on 16 and birdied 17, so that was huge. 
Obviously with the weather today and looking like we might not even play‑‑ I don't know if we got in before the showers, because it rained pretty much all day.   I don't think we got any break or anything like that.   Right now I would rather be teeing off now than when we teed off this morning.   But time will tell what kind of weather they get this afternoon. 

Q.   What do you expect the rest of the way through?   Probably going to be rain all the way through the weekend. 
BILL HAAS:   I haven't even checked.   I don't know.
