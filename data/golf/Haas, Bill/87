 Q.   At the AT&T you talked about look‑and‑go I think was the motto for the week.   Are you still doing that on the greens?  
BILL HAAS:   Yeah, somewhat.   I don't know if it's a look‑and‑go as much as it is just be decisive.   There's certain other putts I'm taking more time on, but the pace of my stroke is maybe a hair quicker.   Some of my strokes ‑‑ I think I was getting a little lazy with and wipey, if you want to say, just being a little bit more‑‑ I think I'm in between‑‑ I'm not into Brandt Snedeker quickness, but I'm trying to be kind of like him because I think he really is effective on the greens.  
   
 Q.   I think when you play quick the athlete in you comes out.   
BILL HAAS:   100 percent, and that was the way I was raised, to play quick.   I think when I was a bad player growing up, my dad was always saying, Come on, come on, let's go and don't hold the guys up behind you.   So when that ball lands, I'm already thinking about the next shot, and I think a lot of guys maybe wait until they get there to think about it, and my mind is going the whole time.   
   
 Q.   You seem to play good at traditional golf courses, Riviera, Congressional.   This would certainly seem to fall into that category?  
BILL HAAS:   You know, I've had okay success here, some good rounds and definitely some bad rounds, but definitely haven't had a week here that I'm that proud of yet.   Hopefully build on this, three more days like today, I'll be right in the hunt probably.   But I didn't ball strike it exceptional.   
Ernie, I played with him, he ball struck it beautifully and I was a little bit erratic and I shot 3‑under and he was 1‑over.   
I think as the four days go on, if I keep hitting it like I'm hitting it, I'll fall back a little bit, but I'm going to go work on it, and hopefully the putter stays hot.
