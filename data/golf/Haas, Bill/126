  Q. What's going through your mind right now?   
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, I felt really comfortable most of the day, did a lot of good things. When you come to 16, that fairway looks so small, and I made it smaller by hitting it in the trees right.   
 And then 17, the fairway looks just as small with the water left.   
 And 18 is a 3- or 2-iron in there, 4-iron. It's a very difficult finish, and I wish I could have done a little better. But I did what I could do.   
  
  Q. What are you going to do between now and when the other guys finish?  
 BILL HAAS: Yeah, I might go hit a few balls and get the reports down there. I think if I sit here, it's probably going to be at least 20 minutes before the last person putts out, so maybe just be on the range and stay loose just in case.
