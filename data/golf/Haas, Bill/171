  Q.  How much are you looking forward to tomorrow?   
 BILL HAAS:  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm very pleased with how I hung in there today.  I was 3-over through four and actually made a 15-footer for par on 5 and it was real ugly real quick.   
 Just kind of hung in there and I knew there was some par 5s left and so hopefully I can build on that tomorrow and strike it a little better.   
  
  Q.  (Did you watch the leaderboards at all)?   
 BILL HAAS:  I'm a scoreboard watcher, just the fact that I'm when I'm playing hoops in a basketball game I'm watching the scoreboard.  I don't see why you wouldn't want to know where you stand or where everybody else stands.   
 Obviously just play your game and you have to be able to do that also and forget about everyone else.  But you know, I do watch, I'm interested.  I don't know if that's a bad or good thing, maybe I'll learn over the years.   
  
  Q.  Do you look at Tiger Woods to see what he's doing more so than the other guys?   
 BILL HAAS:  You look to see what he's doing a little bit but you know he's going to be there, that's no surprise.  He's going to be there.  You can't try to do what he does.  He's his own man and he's unbelievable, the best there's ever been I think.  You start to play your game, try to win playing Bill Haas golf.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 BILL HAAS:  It's a pretty big spot.  Love to Top-5 tomorrow, win tomorrow, just brings up your year.   
 Last year I felt like I kind of struggled all the way to the last event I was thinking about where I stood on the Money List.  If I could somehow come through tomorrow ...
