Q.   You're inside the top 30 all week, tough finish.   Can you just talk about today?
BILL HAAS:   Honestly it seems like the same old story, something I've been doing a lot this year.   Under the gun haven't been able to get it done.   It's something I've got to address and get better.   When there's some pressure and there's a pressure situation I've got to be able to bear down and shoot a good number and not just blow up.   I seem to do it often.   It's frustrating.   I don't know, I've got to take it as a building‑‑ something to build on.   I don't know what else to say. 

Q.   What essentially were you fighting out there those last few holes, just iron play?
BILL HAAS:   Drove the ball fine pretty much all week.   Even today I felt like I got it in places to do well.   Didn't save a shot, only got up‑and‑down one time, three‑putted twice.   Overall putting on the weekend was an issue, but just when nerves are an issue and under the gun, I've got to be better, and right now I'm far from competitive. 

Q.   Did you know that that last putt at 18, if you made it, you were going to fall back into 30th place?   Did you know what it was worth?
BILL HAAS:   No, I did not.   I didn't think I was even close.   That's even more frustrated.   But with that said, I hit a nice putt.   I played left edge, and I thought it would break right.   I'm not mad at the putt, just didn't deserve it.
