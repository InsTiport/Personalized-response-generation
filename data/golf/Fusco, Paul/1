Q. So what were your thoughts on Sei Young's play today?
PAUL FUSCO: Just she just was real calm and just played within herself all day.  Yeah, she just played within herself and just the momentum was going and she just kept riding it, you know.
Q. Did you think that 10-under and 27 for the week could be in play?
PAUL FUSCO: I didn't even think about the 27.  I thought about today after we got to nine, I thought we could tie the record with 10-under and maybe break it for 11.  We had a putt for 11 on the last, but I didn't even think about the 27-under, so that was pretty cool.
Q. Any shots that really stood out to you that kind of swung the momentum?
PAUL FUSCO: Sure.  Hole 11, the second shot, that 5-wood, 245 yards, two feet for eagle.  That was just perfect timing, you know.  Couple more shot lead.  Just kept riding it.
