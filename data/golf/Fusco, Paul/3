Q. Run me through her eagle on 18.PAUL FUSCO: She hit a perfect drive, had 188 meters to the hole, hit a hybrid in there about six feet, a little uphill inside left.Q. What about the rest of her round?PAUL FUSCO: Yesterday she was on the front nine, 3-over at one point, and she brought it back to even par at the end of the day, birdied the last two holes to get to even, which was great.  Her feel wasn't so hot yesterday.  She wasn't feeling it, which is fine.  That happens.  And then today she came out and just found the feel and just went with it and played within herself and made it look easy.Q. A lot of good iron shots or a lot of long putts?  What was it?PAUL FUSCO: Well, a couple long putts, but just everything solid.  Basics.Q. Would you be able to run me through her birdies, how long each of them were?PAUL FUSCO: Sure.  Let me -- hole 2, par-5, was probably a 5-footer for birdie, a little right to left.  Next hole was hole 4, she hit it in there below the hole about three, four feet and rolled it in for birdie.  Next birdie was on hole 8, she hit it just past the pin about 15 feet, rolled it in right to left.  Hole 9 she birdied.  She hit it about 10 feet short of the hole, rolled it in, a little left to righter.  She birdied 11, below the hole about eight, nine feet.  Then birdied 15, hit it about 10 feet below the hole, rolled that in.  Hit it in the rough on 16.  That's where she made her bogey.  Hit it on the green but on the back of the green.  The pin was up front, so it was a tough two-putt.  She three-putted.  And then eagled 18.
