Q. First eagle, what happened?  And then second eagle, what happened?  The TV coverage cut off right when the second eagle happened.  So we didn't get to see it either.
PAUL FUSCO: Hole 2, the first eagle, driver, cut  wood, rolled in about a 25-footer.  I guess.
Q. 25-footer?
PAUL FUSCO: Yeah, I guess.  Then 15 driver, 5 iron.  Almost holed the 5 iron, then rolled by about seven feet and rolled it in.
Q. Okay.  Easy enough.
PAUL FUSCO: Yeah.
Q. Do you ever remember a day when she hit two eagles the first round?
PAUL FUSCO: No.
Q. How many drivers is she hitting out there?  Gerina says she only hits maybe four or five a round?
PAUL FUSCO: She hits some.  Yeah, you're right.  Hole 5, we hit 3 wood.  Hole 1, we hit 5 wood.  Yeah, you're right.  There's a good bit on the driver.
Q. You've been with her for three wins, obviously.  Is this the most dialed in you've seen her through 36 holes in the last year?
PAUL FUSCO: No, I've seen her like that before.  She just stays easy.  She doesn't get excited and just smooth.
Q. Makes it look easy out there?
PAUL FUSCO: Yeah, exactly.
