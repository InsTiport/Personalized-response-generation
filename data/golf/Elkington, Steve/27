STEVE ELKINGTON:  Slid off a little bit there at the last up into the green, but that seemed like that was going to be the one that needed to be in to knock these guys out.  Now that I let that one get away I fully expect to get into a playoff now or maybe now maybe finish one behind, we will see. 
 

Q.  I had a sense like with four or five holes to go that you were thinking 14-under was the number?
 
STEVE ELKINGTON:   Yeah, I felt like I had to get there. I didn't hit the greatest shot on 18.  I was trying to hit a little 7.  I didn't quite get it going.  I thought I could get it to run a little bit more than that, maybe get around there pin-high.  I even had Bob Tway putted before and I got a good read but just turns a lot there and very quick, once it got by the hole it just slid right down.  Bob putted up he is never broke so played it pretty straight maybe just a little left center I hit it pretty solid and caught a lot of -- that lip.
