   STEVE ELKINGTON: I hit every fairway and every green on the front, except for 9 and made a good for and then 10,11, 12 -- I went into the rough on 14 and made a bogey, and then I made a nice -- a real good approach on 16 for an eagle, and I birdied 17. You know, I hit the best drive I could ever hit, and I still hit 3-wood. That hole is just such a beast.   
  
  Q. What was the distance coming in?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: 241. It's playing pretty long.   
  
  Q. Can you describe the feeling that you had, did you expect to play this well?  
 STEVE ELKINGTON: Sure. I always expect to play this well.   
  
  Q. Did you have any particular -- did it feel like a normal round for you?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: No, this is not form. But, you know, this is a great place to play. It's a good energy to play in, the course is great, the weather laid down for us and some scores to be had if you could drive straight and I was able to do that and I played great.  
  
  Q. Excited to be in the mix again?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: Yeah, it's good. Those guys get in the way a little bit, there's a lot of them, but yeah, I'll be around there somewhere.  
  
  Q. So you were thinking that you have to go real low again tomorrow?  
 STEVE ELKINGTON: Well, you know, yeah.   
  
  Q. It's going to be blowing?  
 STEVE ELKINGTON: That's good. The course needs redemption.   
  
  Q. You may have been asked, was it a 3-wood into 16? How far was that?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: 278.   
  
  Q. 15 feet left? Did the putt not break like you thought?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: Didn't break quite like I wanted to.   
  
  Q. When did you last play with Tiger?   
 STEVE ELKINGTON: I played with Tiger -- we had a good time when we played together. I know I always get excited to play with the best players. I played with all of these No. 1s, you know, I got like a book of them. I played with Jack and Arnold and Greg Norman and Faldo, all of those guys were 1. For me, I can't wait to get into that group, because I want to see what they are doing.   
  
  Q. Does it make it harder --  
 STEVE ELKINGTON: Yeah, but it's worth it, you know. It's always been that way. When you played with Nicklaus, it's t was the same way. I've always thought it brings the best golf out in you, for me, anyway, makes you concentrate.
