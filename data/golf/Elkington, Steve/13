TODD BUDNICK:  Let's just off with some comments on your 8 under 64 today, Steve, your best round here since a 63 in 1993.
STEVE ELKINGTON:  You know, I'm delighted to start the year, for me with such a good round.  I've always thought that La Quinta Country Club is always sort of an awkward course for me.  I don't know if I've ever had that really low of a round here.  I got off to such a great start, I started on the 10th hole and made about a 30 footer for a birdie.

On 11, I was just short in two and chipped it on and made about a 5 footer for birdie.

12, I got up and down oust the bunker for par.

13, I hit a drive and a 3 wood about two feet for eagle, so I was 4 under through four.

I bogeyed 15.  3 putted from way off the front.

1, I hit a wedge about three feet.

2, I got up and down oust the bunker.

And, 3 I holed a bunker shot.

The 5th, I was on in two and 2 putted for birdie.

8, I hit a 2 iron and 8 iron about 15 feet and 9 I hit a 2 iron and 9 iron and made birdie.

You know, it wasn't a flawless round, I had a few good holes that kept me going.  As I said, for the first round here, I'm really pleased with it.
TODD BUDNICK:  Can you tell us how long that bunker shot was on 3?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  It was just a short shot right by the flag, probably only 20 feet from the flag.  Just ran right in there.  The greens are really nice here.  It's a great all star course.
Q.  Talk a little about this tournament seems like with Justin last year and Phil the year before, kind of jump starts their year.  Do you look at this event as something that could happen for you, as well?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, could, you know.  I've won the Tournament of Champions twice in my career, so those years, '92 and '95 were both great years for me.  '95 was my best year.

West Coast golf is not for everyone, but I've always tried to participate in it and come out and play West Coast golf.  I've always enjoyed it, coming out here at this time of year and playing some good weather and seeing some friends, amateurs that I've known over the years.  This is my 19th year on TOUR, so I know a lot of people.  It's been a good relationship for me coming out here.
Q.  So is it that important to start the year like you did today with a 64 or is it just another round and you just build on it?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, it's the first round of the year for me.  So I'm delighted, obviously everything I've been working on in the off season and all that came together in the first day.

You know, you can't say that it's mandatory if you do well on the West Coast you're going to have a great year because we've seen guys do the opposite.

I think golf is golf.  You know, when you're playing well, the key is doing well on the TOUR when you do get playing well, you see it through that week, get on up there as far as you can.  Take advantage of it.
Q.  What are some of the things you worked on in the off season?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, just all of the things that I've been working on, nothing specific that's that much of an interest.  I putted well today, bunker shots were good and drove it straight.  All of the typical attributes that go with a good round were there today.

So, you know, just I've had a lot of    I've been on TOUR a long time, so as your question indicated, I don't make too much out of it, the first round, just it was a good start, you know.
Q.  How do you approach this year, your 19th year, as opposed to say your first year, your fifth year or 10th year, is it any different?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Yeah, sure.  Every year is different.  There's never a year the same.  My fifth year or whatever, I was single and looking at playing 40 events.  Now I'm 43 and I've got two children and I might play 20 events.  So every year is different.  I just have to pick my places where I like to go and play and, you know, go from there, really.
Q.  You shot 8 under today and yet Pat Perez shoots 12 under.  This event is obviously very unique in that scores tend to be very low.  Can you talk a little bit about the mindset coming into this event and knowing what you need to do that you pretty much have to shoot like you did today, five days in a row in order to contend?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, you don't have to shoot 8 under five days in a row, that would be 40 under; that would be a pretty good record.  The scores always are low, you're right.  I think guys are somewhat relieved to come out and play courses at this time of year where they know that the score is pretty low.  There's potential there to shoot 67 and gain some confidence.  I think it's sort of a stepping stone tournament where guys can shoot 15 under, 18 , 20 under and feel good about the week.  It's not like there's going to be plenty of weeks where we make the same check at 6 over, U.S. Open or Congressional, something like that.

There's no secret, these courses are short for us.  The conditions are so good, although to me there are there hard holes, and the new course is going to create problems with the wind.  So I don't think the scores overall this year will be as low as they have been.  That's what I'm thinking, anyway.
Q.  You mention building confidence by getting off it a good start for the year coming out to this event, are you surprised maybe more guys don't come out to this event because of that; it gives you a chance to get the motor revved you have a little bit?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, nothing surprises me anymore.  We have guys who don't play in the Top 30 money winners' tournaments.  How can I be surprised they are not playing at the Hope, right?
Q.  You alluded to this a little bit earlier about 43 now, and you're in kind of an age where guys can become complacent.  How do you guard against that when you start another season?
STEVE ELKINGTON:  I went through that about four years ago.  I'm on the other side of that; when I broke my shoulder and had some problems with my health, I got all of that out of the way.  At least right now I have some energy for golf.  I had a decent year last year and I almost won the PGA, so I had some good things coming my way a little bit.

Golf careers are just like any other career, you kind of    you don't have energy, you don't have super energy every year, but some years just seem like a waste.  I've had a few of those with injuries.  For example, like Ernie Els is coming off one, his last year 'in 05 was a waste, and I've had a few of those.  I feel like for me, at least, I'm not complacent at all.  I have none of that.
TODD BUDNICK:  All right, Steve, thank you very much for your time.  Good luck the rest of the week.
