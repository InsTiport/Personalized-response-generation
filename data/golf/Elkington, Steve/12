   STEVE ELKINGTON:  Yeah, I've had a great week.  It's been fun playing in front of this crowd.  We had a little cool weather today and brought the wind up, which I think at the end of the day helped me because the scoring is always pretty good here on the weekends.  But the wind made the course much tougher, much trickier, and I was able to hit some good shots and get under par and hang on to it. 

 Q.  How different did the course play today in the cold, windy conditions than earlier in the week when it got warm in the afternoon and the greens seemed to be a little softer? 
 STEVE ELKINGTON:  Well, this is the kind of golf course where you're going to have some easy holes downwind, like the 13th hole is a very easy hole downwind.  But once you turn the back in the other direction, some of these holes, like the 9th hole, we were hitting driver, 9-iron all week, but now we're hitting driver and a 3-iron.  It's a 20-mile-an-hour wind, but because it's cold, it's playing like 50, 60 yards longer.  So it changed everything. 

 Q.  Didn't bother you any out there.  Great playing this week, Steve. 
 STEVE ELKINGTON:  Thanks very much.
