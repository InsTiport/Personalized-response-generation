  MATTHEW NIXON:   I just played nicely.   Nothing really has changed for the last year or something.   Been working really hard on my putting.   That's been the part of my game that's been letting me down and everything just seemed to click.   I holed some nice putts and I had a bit of luck go my way.   It's amazing what happens when you start holing putts. 

Q.   I haven't seen your name on boards in recent tournaments.   You look like you've been moving up. 
MATTHEW NIXON:   Yeah, it's been a long time since I've been in the situation that I am now, but I've been working hard on my game and stuff and my coaches and working really hard on my putting, that's the thing you do really well to score. 
As long as I can learn over the weekend and stuff and enjoy myself, that's all I really want to do.

Q.   You sound like you're confident with where your game is at the moment and no doubt it's frustrating when the putts don't hold?
MATTHEW NIXON:   It's been a very frustrating sort of nine months really.   But hopefully I've turned a bit of a corner and the things I'm working on are moving me in the right direction, and as long as I keep working on that, hopefully the scores will continue to be like they are today. 

Q.   Is there anything good Gut LÃ¤rchenhof that appeals to your game?
MATTHEW NIXON:   I think it suits very much the way I play.   It's not the longest golf course in the world.   You've got to drive it well and keep it out of the rough.   You know, the greens are good, so you've just got to hold putts and stuff.   The weekend, I'm really looking forward to it, and we'll see what happens.   

Q.   I take it that you were amongst those on the first day that might have had some trouble even getting to the course?
MATTHEW NIXON:   Yeah, we set off, I was with Tommy Fleetwood and we set off with plenty of time, and so we thought, it was funny, the driver had us take a little bit of a de tour and as we got up to a little bit of traffic, we were only about two kilometers away and I looked on Twitter, and saw Chris Wood walking through some field and I thought, this can't be good. 
Then it took us about half an hour to do the last two kilometers but luckily I just had enough time to warm up properly, so we were all right.

Q.   So you did get the car all the way in?
MATTHEW NIXON:   Yeah, definitely.   I'll be making sure that I get an early car for tomorrow, I know that. 

Q.   That first day, we knew just how the rain affected the course and the greens were pretty soft but some lovely scores out there.   Is it playing any different? 
MATTHEW NIXON:   It's definitely playing tougher, because of the wind, but when you give the best players in the world soft greens and not a short‑ish golf course, but a very scorable golf course the scores are going to be good no matter what the conditions. 
I'm surprised scoring is not worse today but it's there for the taking if you can be aggressive and just go for it really.
