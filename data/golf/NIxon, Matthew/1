Q. Concentrate on negatives, but as you say they weren't that bad?MATTHEW NIXON: Well, they were terrible.  It was absolutely a snafu followed by full on (indiscernible).  It laid me up for a perfect yardage for sand wedge, hit that close, managed to make the putt for a par.Q. Talk me through 18.MATTHEW NIXON: I was looking at the leaderboard and thinking Justin Rose was there.  It was just one of them, just try and hit it close.  I hit it and the minute it went in, I was like an ace.Q. There should be some celebration, shouldn't there?MATTHEW NIXON: Still a long ways to go anyway, it would be nice to just keep going and see where we finish at the end of the week.Q. Have you come to terms with the coaching arrangement?MATTHEW NIXON: If I keep playing like that, it will be well worth it.Q. I know we said this yesterday, but sometimes you make a change and it clicks?MATTHEW NIXON: Definitely, definitely.  It helps when it's a beautiful day and the golf course is one of the best we play.  As you say, I don't mind playing.Q. And if it happens to be Justin Rose tomorrow?MATTHEW NIXON: It's one of them you sort of practice for, to be up there and play with them people.  I'm sure it will be a day of learning.  It will be interesting to see how he goes about his business.  Busines
