Q. So just a matter of inches there. Broke on you or...
JASON SCHULTZ: Yeah, I wasn't my best putt. At least I had a chance. For a while wasn't looking like I was going to have a chance.
At least I had a putt to try to extend it. That's all I can ask for.
Q. It was a battle. He got a lead on you at the turn but you came back at him.
JASON SCHULTZ: Yeah, I'll never quit. Man, I didn't take advantage of some of the opportunities I had. He played good. He didn't let up. I just didn't make the putts when I needed to.
Q. You made a birdie at 13 to cut in to the lead. How you did you do that?
JASON SCHULTZ: 13 I got pretty lucky. Hit it left and took a drop. Was able to hit it past the hole and have it kind of run back and actually made a decent putt.
Then good shot on 14. Didn't get up and down.
15 was great.
16 was good.
I mean, usually my short game is really my strength. The opportunities I had didn't pan out.
Q. You were a little worried coming into the day about stamina. Did you prevail over that?
JASON SCHULTZ: You know, adrenaline does a lot, so I didn't feel it as much as I was thinking I was. I kind of paced myself a little bit, too. Probably wasn't the fastest round of golf that I've ever played, but felt like I just kind of took it as a stroll and see what would happen.
Q. How would you rate the week for you?
JASON SCHULTZ: It was great. Awesome. Awesome. Obviously I would've loved to get one more, two more wins, but I don't play much golf, so this is a lot of fun. It's fun to be competing and actually have a little bit of success paragraph it was a good week. Great week.
Q. Does the fire burn a little more? Want to play just a touch more than you are?
JASON SCHULTZ: Maybe. I mean, thing is I like playing in events. Like I like playing in stuff like this where the conditions are hard, it's tournament golf, it's competition.
I probably don't have the time to play much, but I'll play a couple a year probably.
Q. Do you go right back to work tomorrow?
JASON SCHULTZ: Yeah.
Q. Thanks for your time.
JASON SCHULTZ: Yeah. Nice seeing you.
Q. We'll see you again.
JASON SCHULTZ: Okay.
