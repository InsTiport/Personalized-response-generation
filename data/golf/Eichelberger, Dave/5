Q.  When did you know you were in the lead?

DAVE EICHELBERGER:  Oh, when I birdied the 15th hole.  I hit the best 3-wood I have hit in my life, absolutely perfect shot; don't think I could ever hit a better one.  Carried 245 yards out there, almost went in, and went past the hole, but that hole right there is where I kind of felt like it was my tournament to win at that point.


Q.  Started to feel that while walking up 18 (inaudible) --

DAVE EICHELBERGER:  Trying to keep all your emotions in check and just go ahead and finish on out; still had just a little work to do, didn't want, you know, 3-putt or anything like that, kind of leave the door open.  Just fundamentals and don't get ahead of yourself, don't start thinking about what you are going to say at the ceremony, all that sort of stuff.


Q.  Where does this rate in your golf accomplishments?

DAVE EICHELBERGER:  Oh, this is biggest by far.


Q.  You held real steady until you came in signed your score card realized what you had done.

DAVE EICHELBERGER:  Well, yeah pretty much.  Just little bit of in state of shock there for some time, but settling down a little bit now.
