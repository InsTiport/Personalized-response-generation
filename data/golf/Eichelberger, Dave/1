Q.   A young man like you makes the cut.   How does that feel? 
DAVE EICHELBERGER:   I'm just not quite ready to say make the cut here until this thing is all done, but it does feel pretty good, I have to say.

Q.   You came into the round today with some form coming in here or‑‑
DAVE EICHELBERGER:   You know, been playing for the last two months around home.   I'd had a bad spell, I guess.   My handicap was zero, which ain't too good in this league.
But right here in the last month, in fact, the last three weeks, my handicap went to plus 4 in about three weeks' time.   I mean, of course, I shot like‑‑ played like ten rounds, nine of them in the 60s.   So something has gone on here, just in the last couple of weeks before I came.

Q.   The golf course kind of fits you.   Is that‑‑
DAVE EICHELBERGER:   This golf course, this is one of the better Senior Open events‑‑ best one I've ever seen.   This one, Salem, that was a great old course.   And this one here is just a jewel.   I love this one.

Q.   Congratulations.   I hope the number fits you. 
DAVE EICHELBERGER:   Thank you.   My daughter can't believe it.
