Q. Give us a quick synopsis of how you played.
MICHAEL MUEHR: Played okay.  It's always a competitive match with Mr. Elliott.  We've played a lot over the years, at the Crump and various spots.
You know, he's a grinder.  We both kind of grinded it out.  Neither of us played great.  That's the deal with match play.  Just got to play a little bit better than the other guy.
Q. What was the turning point for you?
MICHAEL MUEHR: He actually missed a short putt on 10.  I had just three-putted nine, and so that put me 2-up.  Then he missed about a four-footer.
I just felt like that was a tough spot for him to be, 2-down with a lot of longer par 4s coming up on the back nine.
That's where I kind of felt like I had to put a little more pressure on him and then just hang in.
Q. Do you like the state of your game right now?
MICHAEL MUEHR: I do.  I do.  I'm very under control off the tee; irons are really solid; putting my longer lie putts really, really close.
So if I can make a few of the shorter ones, I like my chances.
Q. How do you feel?  Fatigue?  Anything?  Did Sunday help?
MICHAEL MUEHR: No, it's really hot.  I don't if it really helped because we didn't spend it wisely.  We were at a sports bar and then playing gin all afternoon.  So I couldn't say Sunday helped.
At some point adrenaline kicks in.  I've played enough golf the last two months that I'm in pretty good shape physically, and then a little bit of adrenaline, it's easy to get up physically.
