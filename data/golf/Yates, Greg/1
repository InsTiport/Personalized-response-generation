Q. So people don't know much about you because I was just getting something from the PGA TOUR Guide.
So, how did it feel out there as you were mentioning on camera there that this is a pretty important start for you, aiming for this week?
GREG YATES: It felt pretty good.  I know I put in a lot of hard work but I'm still trying to have a good time because that's how I play my best golf is trying to enjoy myself out there and have fun.  That's why I got him on the bag to keep it light.
Q. Is he a friend from college?
GREG YATES: High school buddy.  Played a lot of rounds of golf since 5th, 6th grade.
Q. Your last start on Web.com or PGA TOUR was when?
GREG YATES: I believe it was the last regular season event on the Webb.
Q. The Tour Championship?
GREG YATES: No, the regular season, Pumpkin Ridge.
Q. Did you make it to the playoffs?
GREG YATES: No, I missed it by $9,000 or so.  85th on the money list.
Q. So you're here by virtue of a collegiant event?  You can't be that old.
GREG YATES: I'm 24.  This is my first year out of college.
Q. Has it come tougher or easier?  When you have gotten out here you've had success.
GREG YATES: Yeah.  It's hard.  It's tough to get starts.  Like I said, I got on the Web so fast, finished 2nd in my first event and got deferred status.
I played okay on the Web last year outside of that.  I got really good at making putts but then I would just kind of for the weekend kind of level out and I end up at the bottom of the pack.  Little frustrating.
Q. You graduated from A & M in June and went out on the Web?
GREG YATES: I graduated in December but finished up my eligibility in May.
Q. So 2-under today is even better than usual on this course because of the wind.  Did it feel windy out there?
GREG YATES: Yeah, it felt windy.  I've grown up in Texas, I've been practicing in the wind the last four months.  It's the middle of winter rolls around, it could be pretty windy up there.
Q. Where do you live?
GREG YATES: I live in College Station.
