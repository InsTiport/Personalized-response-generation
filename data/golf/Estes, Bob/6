Q.   Bob, 5‑under 66 in Round 1, stumbled coming home a little bit, but otherwise are you pretty pleased with that?
BOB ESTES:   Yeah, it was a good score.   It was just a yard or two away from‑‑ overall I played really well, yeah.

Q.   You played pretty well last week.   What's charged you up coming into the playoffs here?
BOB ESTES:   Well, starting in Canada, I figured a few things out, sort of made some progress with my grip, setup and my swing.   And I made a few changes.
This week also to help me play better on this golf course, I've got a little longer driver than a 3‑wood.   This golf course pretty much demands you carry the ball a long way off the tee.   And there's a lot of approach shots where you want to be hitting 7‑iron not 4‑ or 5‑iron.   It's better to drive it long here.

Q.   Can you imagine these conditions being any better tomorrow?
BOB ESTES:   No, I mean I know it's supposed to storm at some point tomorrow.   But today was perfect.

Q.   What are you looking forward to as far as your progression here through the playoffs?   Do you know what you have to do to move on to Chicago?
BOB ESTES:   I have an idea, but not really.   I'm not really thinking about that.   I'm just working really hard on my game and trying to get my equipment and specs dialed in just right.   And just learn to swing the club better and just play better golf.
