 Q.   Talk about how today went for you.   You shot real low.   
BOB ESTES:   Yeah, I did.   I made eight birdies and no bogeys, so‑‑ and I made some good putts, but I lipped out a few also, so it could have been a little better, could have been a little bit worse.   
So for the most part I drove it fairly well and hit lots of good iron shots, the weather was perfect, and it was playing about as easy as it could and I was one of the ones I guess that was able to take advantage of it.   
   
 Q.   It's a birdiefest out there always here at this tournament, did you feel like you had to get off to a real good start today, now that it's a four round tournament?  
BOB ESTES:   For sure.   All three of these courses somebody's going to shoot, you know, 8‑ or 9‑ or 10‑under every day, so, yeah, you just have to keep making birdies, obviously.   
So, yeah I just kept trying to make more.   And I birdied the last two to go from 6‑under to 8‑under.   So I knew it was going to take 20 or nor win.   So you just got keep making birdies.
