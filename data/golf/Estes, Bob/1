Q. You are solo fourth at the Senior Open.  Pretty proud of that, I'm sure, with the amount of separation you weren't able to make because of your elbow?
BOB ESTES: Yeah, it's almost better than what I could have hoped for based on the last three and a half months or so, and even though I played last week and didn't play that well, I played pretty good the first round and then some things got off, and so what I learned last week I was able to apply this week and stuck with it for the most part all week long.  I made too many mistakes yesterday, but overall it was a really good week.
Q. The golf course, a little firmer, a little faster today?
BOB ESTES: Yeah, it definitely -- the greens were quite a bit firmer, and then the 4th hole with playing back into the wind and the pin back left was almost a par-5, and then the 5th hole, the very next hole, was about 252 or 253 yards to the hole, I believe, back into -- no, that one would have been a little bit downwind.  But still, just a really long, hard par-3.
It was real easy to go bogey-bogey on those two holes, and that's what I did starting out.  I didn't birdie either 1 or 2 with a sand wedge.  So it would have been nice to at least get one birdie those first two holes.  But anyway I was 2-over after five, so I was coming from behind all day.
Q. Overall your assessment of the week?
BOB ESTES: Oh, yeah, my elbow survived, and my game was pretty good and can get better.  I was playing pretty good early in the year and then having three months off really obviously sets me back, but now I feel with what I learned last week and getting to play, which really helped me this week and going forward, yeah, I should have some good tournaments coming up.
