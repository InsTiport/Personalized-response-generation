Q.   I know you're a little frustrated shooting 3‑over par, but you still finished in the Top‑10 and the big news is that you're playing in Deutsche Bank; and you started the week 103rd in the FedExCup standings and now you're 63rd. 
BOB ESTES:   I would have liked to move up a lot more but just couldn't quite get it done today.   I only made one mental mistake knocking it over the back of the green on 10 where I hit too much club. 
Hit a couple of putts that looked like they were in for sure and they just didn't drop.   Overall a good week, I made a lot of progress since last Saturday.

Q.   A little bit of a frustrating day but in the big picture, you're headed up to Boston and another big payday could await you?
BOB ESTES:   Yeah, now that I've gotten another good six days here, you know, that can only help me going into Boston.   I'll just try to keep doing the same stuff and hopefully it will be better next week.
