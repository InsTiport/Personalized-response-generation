Q.   (Inaudible.)
BOB ESTES:   A couple long putts.   I did get the hole‑in‑one, but I did miss a couple of short birdie putts, too.   I had a 6‑under and then the wind got me on 16, it changed directions, after I hit a good looking approach shot, buried it in the bunker and made bogey there.
And then the slope got me on No. 18.   I pulled it a little bit left.   And I hit it left of the green and I escaped with a bogey.
A 4‑under was good.   I felt like I finally got over the hump somewhat, because I felt like I was playing better.   But it could have been a lot better.

Q.   Can you talk about that ace. 
BOB ESTES:   Yeah, that's one of the hardest par‑3s you're going to see.   The greens are really firm.   It was 173 to the front and 184 to the hole.   So I was trying to carry it in that 178 range.   And I pretty much hit that number.   And I then it rolled in.   I told it to go in and it did.   So it listened.

Q.   Mayfair hit his on 7 yesterday.   Did you guys talk about that at all?
BOB ESTES:   Well, yeah, so obviously when I made mine, it was Charley's turn next, but he didn't get one.   The back left pin on No.7 where Billy made his, you're hardly ever going to see a hole‑in‑one there and he made it.

Q.   Have you ever been in a group where two guys made a hole‑in‑one in a week?
BOB ESTES:   No, I don't think that happens very often.   You'll have to check the records to see if that's happened at all out here.   Maybe it has.   But I'm not aware of it.
