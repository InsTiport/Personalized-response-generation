 Q.  Talk about 16 where you took the match back to all square.  
BRETT BONER: He just had a really tough two-putt.  It was a long putt up over a hill and he just hit it a little too hard and it kept running.  He three-putted and I made a good two-putt.   
Then after that, going back to what we talked about the last two days about match play and knowing what your opponent is doing, it was just a grind.   
Hit a really good drive an 18 and it got one inch into the rough.  Couldn't get a really good club on it.  I didn't hit a good chip it there.  Hit a decent putt and then he hit a good chip and missed his putt, which was fortunate for me.   
I had a birdie putt to win on 1, I had a par putt to win on 2, I had a birdie putt to win on 3, and didn't make 'em.  Thankfully I was hitting it good.   
Then I hot two really good, solid shots on 4 when he was in the bunker.   
 Q.  And then going into the round of 32 knowing you can close out an intense match like that, does that help your confidence?  
BRETT BONER: It does.  I mean, it's just next hole, next shot now.  I got to get some food and change clothes, but match play is crazy.  I didn't make a birdie today.   
I remember Scott Harvey couple years ago said he didn't have his best stuff in one round at all, and he was just fortunate to advance.  I am very fortunate right now that I got a chance.
