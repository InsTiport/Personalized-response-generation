 Q. Talk about the experience of being at the PGA. 
 TODD LANCASTER: It was great. It was a rough day today. It was difficult scoring conditions and you can show how good these guys are to be able to play in these conditions with the wind and the greens getting firm and stuff to be able to shoot the scores that they did. It shows the difference between them and the PGA pros, a day like today. 

 Q. What can you take away, the pressure, the people, the conditions out there, what can you take away and bring back to your membership back home? 
 TODD LANCASTER: It's a hard question. I mean, these guys are good. I mean, everybody at the club thinks that I'm a great player and you know, I was lucky enough to qualify but just to see the difference between what these guys can do and what PGA pros can do, there's a big difference. There's a fine line but there's just the little things that they do, short game is most things that come to mind. Their short game is just so much better than ours. 
 So I'll tell my members to work on their short game as much as they can. 

 Q. Is there one moment, whether it's the practice round or scoring rounds, that's going to stick with you? 
 TODD LANCASTER: There was a lot of fans in the practice rounds signing autographs which people told me, make sure you have a Sharpie, because you'll sign a bunch of autographs, but I just didn't think they would want my autograph, but they do. Gives you a lot of respect for what players deal with on a day-to-day basis. On the first hole I hit a shot to the right of the green, probably the hardest shot I had short-game-wise and I almost made it and the crowd went crazy and that's one thing that I'll remember.
