  Q. Todd, how did it go out there? How did it feel?   
 TODD LANCASTER: Good. Of course it was nerve-racking my first PGA, first couple of holes. But I got through it okay. Hit the ball really well. Hit one bad shot on 7 -- actually No. 8, the par 3 that went into the water. Made double bogey there. Other than that I hit a lot of good shots and just couldn't make any putts. I don't know how many putts I ended up with, but it was a lot.  
  
  Q. How does it feel to play a course this long?  
 TODD LANCASTER: It played shorter today. They moved a couple tees up a little bit. And probably just a little bit of adrenalin. The clubs are going a little bit further. But it is definitely the longest one that I've ever played.  
  
  Q. What are you going to change for the next round?  
 TODD LANCASTER: Just going to try to hit some putts up there on the putting green, try to get a little bit better -- only had one 3-putt, but I had a lot of makeable birdie putts that I didn't make. So I'm trying to get it smoothed out and play ready for tomorrow.
