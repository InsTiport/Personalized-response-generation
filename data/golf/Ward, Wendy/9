 Q. How was it out there for you today? 
 WENDY WARD: You know, starting out it was really nice. You know, you start to think, you know, did you get the good or the bad end the draw, silly things like that. 
 The wind was hardly blowing, it wasn't raining, and then Doug Brecht, our official, he kind the gave us the one-hour window before the rain was coming, and he was pretty accurate with us. 
 And then it just -- you just gotta kind the mutter through it, you know. 

 Q. Seemed like when you were on like about 4 you could look and see some darker clouds the you're thinking, that's probably gonna knock us off the course, but it really never picked up. 
 WENDY WARD: This course really drains well. The officials told us that it only got a half inch from last night through this morning, so we expected to play till dark. I did at least.

 Q. Are you pleased with the amount the golf you got in today?
 WENDY WARD: Yeah, very, very. We've got six holes left, and you know, we just knew it was gonna be overcast and not quite get 5:30 out of it. 
 I was happy that I had a tap-in for birdie on 12. So I was happy just to finish that out, and fresh start tomorrow.

 Q. How pleased are you that the LPGA is back in Texas?
 WENDY WARD: Oh, I'm tickled pink. I've been trying to get back here forever. Been trying to get to San Antonio, Houston, Dallas. I'm not that picky where we play. 
 I sure noticed it on the 1st and 10th tee respectively the last two days. Just some people excited that we're back and excited to see their Texas girls playing.

 Q. So you're getting some additional support being from Texas?
 WENDY WARD: I feel like I am. I ran into a high school golf coach that I hadn't seen in probably 18, 19 years, you know. Just kind the brings back memories. It's always good to, you know, kind of have somewhat of a hometown event.
