 Q.   18â€‘year veteran of the LPGA Tour and you've been through a few rain delays yourself.   What do you do on a day like today?  
WENDY WARD:   A day like today you just can't overthink.   They happen.   Unfortunately they've been happening a little bit more often than we'd probably like them out here on tour.  
But you know, you gotta relax and just kind of roll with it.   It's not something you can control, and 18 years on tour I'm not going to run out there to the driving range any time soon.  
   
 Q.   You've played Locust Hill a lot.   You've had some good rounds of golf here and some good finishes on this golf course.   What is going to happen to this golf course due to all the rain and saturation?  
WENDY WARD:   You know, this course has taken in a lot of water before we got here, and it takes water well, but in these amounts there's not too many facilities that can help it.  
But you know, it's just going to take patience.   And you know you're not going to get a lot of good lies out there.   The ball is going to sit down.  
To me, I just gotta let it go and just play golf, and whatever number you put on the scorecard, that may be par for the day.  
   
 Q.   Well, thank you.   We hope you enjoy your day.   Grab an umbrella and relax.
