Q.  Talk a little bit about the match.
WENDY WARD:  I started out, I birdied the first two holes, so I started out kind of hot.  I think I was maybe 5 , or 6 under on the front.  But Silvia kept rattling off birdies, to at least catch me, and the back nine kind of slowed down a little bit.  But as I was able to get her to dormie.  I felt pretty good at that point?
Q.  Were there a lot of birdies out there?
WENDY WARD:  You know, I didn't hit it as close as yesterday, but I made more putts today.  It's just a matter of maybe being a little more comfortable with the greens.
Q.  How do you feel about tomorrow?
WENDY WARD:  My game is in good shape.  I've never met Ai Miyazato, but she's beaten two really good players, so I'm not going to count her out by any means.
