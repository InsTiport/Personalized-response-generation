Q.  It was a really tight match all the way through, and it seemed like everything you    seemed like you couldn't really make up any ground there in the Back 9?
WENDY WARD:  Yeah, and every time we seemed like we had managed it on the greens, we couldn't get one to drop.  We made a lot of good putts out there and gave them a good run, just came up a little short.
