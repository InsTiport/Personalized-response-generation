   WENDY WARD: We thought we could take a little more aggressive line. I hit it right where I wanted to, and just being a little early and little breeze it didn't quite carry. I had to play a whole lot differently than I had practiced. 
 I didn't really do a whole lot wrong. I did enough wrong to make a double, but, you know, hit my putt out of the fringe. Didn't come out like I thought it would and hit a good second putt. 
 So minimize the mistakes. That's what we're all about.

 Q. You're a veteran of the Women's Open. Three shots from the lead after two rounds, that's where it sits right now, with I.K. being 3-under. So you're still within striking distance. 
 WENDY WARD: Yeah, I mean, U.S. Open is about trying to minimize mistakes and, you know, just kind of maintain your position, try not to make the big numbers.
 That was a little unfortunate at the end right there, and I'm going to home to get some rest and come back later this afternoon.
