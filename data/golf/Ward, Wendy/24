Q.  Wendy and Beth, we were up on 7, what turned the matched around?

WENDY WARD:  They made two putts, they made a putt on 8 and a putt on 9, they made a lot of putts, and poor Beth here, was playing with one arm because her partner wasn't playing very well. 

BETH DANIEL:  That's not true.  They plain and simply made more putts than us.  We hit the ball well enough to win that match, we just did not make the putts; that was the difference.
Q.  You two played so well yesterday against Iben and Raquel.

BETH DANIEL:  Well, we won our match. 

Q.  What was different about today?

WENDY WARD:  Beth actually hit the ball better today than yesterday.

BETH DANIEL:  I played a lot better today than I did yesterday, but I just made more putts yesterday.  Match play boils down to putting.  They made a lot of putts, miles and miles of putts today, this group, all week.
Q.  Do you feel better today?

BETH DANIEL:  No comment.
