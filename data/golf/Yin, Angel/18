Q. Very well played coming down the stretch.  How about the 17th hole.  You had eagle opportunity.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, I like the finishing holes.  They're challenging, but also can go for it.  Almost got an eagle again today.
Yeah, overall really good.
Q. What's is it about the back nine on this golf course?  30 yesterday; 32 today.  Yesterday you said, I thought I was being hypnotized by my caddie.  I kind of glided around.
ANGEL YIN: It happened again.  So we got to the back nine and he just hypnotized me again.  I said, Do what you did yesterday.  Yeah, I think we just keep playing the back nine, just the back.
Q. Might be a bit of a big ask for the tournament organizers.  You're in contention going into the final round?  Are you excited about that?  Do you love the prospect of competing?
ANGEL YIN: Yes, I love competing.  That's why I'm playing, right?  Yeah, I'm excited to be in contention again going into Sunday.
Q. 18th birdie was particularly good just a few moments ago.
ANGEL YIN: Yes.  Yeah, hopefully can birdie 18 holes tomorrow.
Q. You've got your mom out here as well.  She's not a golfer, is she?
ANGEL YIN: No, she's not.  I'm the only golfer in the family.
Q. How did that come about?
ANGEL YIN: I don't know.  I don't know how that happened.
Q. She takes care of things off the golf course, so she's very handy to have with you.
ANGEL YIN: Yes.  So even though she doesn't want to travel with me, come.  Come.  Do the other stuff so I can lay horizontal in bed after the round.
