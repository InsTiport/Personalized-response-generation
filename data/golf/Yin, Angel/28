Q. What was the key to your round today?  Played pretty well.
ANGEL YIN: I putted pretty well in my front nine, and then it didn't go in.  I think it was just because it was getting late in the day.  The rain was playing an effect on the green speed.
The back nine I was getting either the speed correct not the line, or the line but not the speed.
So stayed patient, played well, grinded through.  Yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.  Better weather.
Q. They're a pretty good group.
ANGEL YIN: Oh, yeah, great group.
Q. Who do you think is the longest hitter in your group?
ANGEL YIN: I don't know.  I can't say anything, no.  Yeah.
Q. A lot of distance though.  What do you do differently facing these kind of conditions?
ANGEL YIN: Stay patient.  I mean, I don't know.  Actually I think the game plan just stays the same even if the weather differs.  It's going to be hard for everyone.
Q. That seems like it's become your mantra.
ANGEL YIN: Every time you ask me something, Patience.  I'm trying to sound old.  Patience, young one.
Q. Was there someone who taught you that or you kind of came up with it on your own?
ANGEL YIN: I've always heard it so I'm starting to use it now.
Q. And it's working for you?
ANGEL YIN: It's working.  Kind of.
Q. Do you practice that or just...
ANGEL YIN: I don't practice that.  I don't meditate.  (Indiscernible) meditation.
Yeah, I don't practice it.  I don't think I'll be able to practice it.
Q. Did you play here last year?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, I did.
Q. You did?
ANGEL YIN: Uh-huh.
Q. How did you do?
ANGEL YIN: Did well the first two days and then kind of just fumbled.
Q. Extra motivation for you?
ANGEL YIN: Yes.  Yep.  To play better than last year.
Q. Do you get that a lot?  Like when you go back to a course that may not have done like your absolute best, does it motivate you to play better?
ANGEL YIN: Yes, for sure.
