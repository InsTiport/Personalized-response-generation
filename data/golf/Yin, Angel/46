 Q.  Angel Yin, 5-under par 67 at the opening round of the ManuLife LPGA Classic.  A Rookie on the LPGA tour this year, but certainly didn't play like one, at least for the first nine holes there.  What was working well for you today?  
ANGEL YIN: Today was just hitting it well, around the hole, like about 15 footers, and I made my putts.  My putting and my second shot was really good today.  I made an eagle on 9.   
 Q.  Just a couple mistakes on the back nine there.  What would you need to go to tighten things up into tomorrow's round?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, so today on the back nine it was bad misses, so it resulted in a few bogeys -- one bogey and a double.   
Overall I feel like I played pretty well today.   
 Q.  Like I said, you are a rookie this year, but you've had some tremendous finishes, a couple Top 5 finishes at that.  How would you assess your season so far?  
ANGEL YIN: I'm really happy with my game right now this season.  It's going really well.
