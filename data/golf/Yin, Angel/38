 Q.  Here with Angel Yin after a 3-under par 68 today.  Angel, what was working well out there for you today?  
ANGEL YIN: My putting was working pretty well.  I shanked it out on the first hole, so I got off to a rough start, but I recovered.   
 Q.  What do you think about this golf course?  The greens have been running pretty quick, but how would you assess this layout?  
ANGEL YIN: I love the course, it's pretty straightforward.  I think my speed is pretty good today because of last week.  The greens were running about like inches last week, so that helps a lot.   
 Q.  As a rookie on the LPGA Tour this year, how much have you learned not just about your golf game, but overall?  How much have you learned?  
ANGEL YIN: A lot.  I just have a lot to work on, and I've been working on it the last two months and it's improved and shown in my game in scoring lower.  So it's good.   
 Q.  Take me through last week a little bit.  Tremendous victory for the team, a lot of close relationships as well.  How much fun did you have last week at the Solheim Cup?  
ANGEL YIN: I had a blast.  It was the best experience I've ever had playing golf.  And now I think I'm better with huge crowd.  Honestly, I feel more comfortable, but, it was amazing.
