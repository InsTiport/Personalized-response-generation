Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  Great round today, 7-under.  How do you feel?  How did it go today?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, I felt great.  I had a good group today again.  I played with the loving angel I didn't know and Brittany Lincicome.  We had a lot of fun today and I played really didn't, and that helps.
Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  That's good.  That's good.  Had some monster drives out there with some irons, monster irons out there.  How did you feel about your game overall?
ANNE VAN DAM: I would say pretty good.  I struggled a little bit on some holes.  Missed a few fairways and hit a couple of poor irons.
But overall, I feel like on the easier holes or easier greens, yeah, I hit it close and got my birdies from there.
So sometimes I took it a little bit safe and not hit driver like you on every hole, I sometimes hit a 3-iron or a 3-wood.  But yeah, I guess it worked for me today.
Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  You made some amazing putts throughout the round today.  Tell me a little bit about that.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, it's actually quite funny, because I haven't been putting great at all like the last half year.  I changed putters two days ago.  I didn't practice that much with it.
I completely got something else, normally I have face-balance, and now I have toe hang.  It's a blade.  Normally I have a mallet.  So everything is different.  But I look the look of it and it's going well, so maybe that's the change this week.
Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  I'm sorry, but if you don't mind me asking, why did you switch putters?  What happened to the other one?
ANNE VAN DAM: Well, my putter from last week just needed a break.  I didn't putt well as Q-School, so I was a little disappointed with that putter.  So yeah, he couldn't come this week.
Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  What are you expecting for the next two days?  What are you looking forward to?
ANNE VAN DAM: Unfortunately I'm not playing with you.  Maybe on Sunday we can play together.  I would love that.
No, I'm just looking forward to go out there again and play two more days.  Like it's the two last days of this season, and I hope to just finish up great and hit some more monster drives, hole a few more putts with my new putter and should be great.
Q. (BY ANGEL YIN):  Thank you.  Good luck in the next two days and see you here again.
ANGEL YIN: Yesterday was so bad.  I was going to cry.  I was going to bring her tissues.  I was almost going to use the tissues myself.  Today was better.  I think she let me off a little easier.
Yeah, she's hitting it really far right now.  I'm impressed?
ANNE VAN DAM: Just now.
ANGEL YIN: Just now.  Like last year, played with her, I was like, all that six feet height wasted, and this year was like, oh, I'm impressed.
Q. Are you hitting it longer than Angel and Brittany?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, by miles.
ANGEL YIN: And yesterday on 18, she hooked it around the trees and she had an 8-iron in on the par 5.
Q. Is that the longest drive you've hit so far?
ANNE VAN DAM: Probably, yeah, because the hole, it's like 470 metres, so it's like 320 or something.
ANGEL YIN: My excuse is that I broke my driver before I came here.  It's a new thing and I need to warm it up, break it in.
ANNE VAN DAM: Irons?  Or like 2-iron.
ANGEL YIN: I was impressed.
ANNE VAN DAM: But it was good.  Like we all hit it long, so that's nice.
Q. You all seem to be getting on.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, it helps.  We had a lot of fun out there today, and yesterday, as well.  We were all playing well.  We were all under par for two rounds in a row, and yeah, we all hit it long, so that helps.  That helps with the game.  All play aggressive.
Q. What's your longest-ever drive?
ANNE VAN DAM: Probably that one on 18.  320 metres, that's like 370 yards or something.
ANGEL YIN: It's close to 400.
ANNE VAN DAM: No, no, that's 360.  I think it's like 370.
ANGEL YIN: That's pretty freaking long.
Q. What's your longest ever?
ANGEL YIN: I don't know longest ever, but I would say consistently longest was Solheim week.
Q. Are you two now best friends?
ANGEL YIN: Why not.
ANNE VAN DAM: She's a bit tiny.  It's fun.  We should play together more often.
ANGEL YIN: We should play together more often.
Q. How tall are we saying?
ANGEL YIN: 5'11, six feet, six feet and a half.
