Q. Take us through some of your round today, and how were you feeling out there on the course?
ANGEL YIN: I felt good.  Felt comfortable.  I made one birdie, so it was quite quiet on the front nine; made one birdie and a bunch of pars.  Putts weren't really dropping but I was hitting really good putts.  Shots were good but they weren't close enough where you really have an opportunity to make the putt.
Then the back nine just came together.  No. 10 wasn't great.  I kind of bombed my six-footer past the hole.  But other than that, the back nine just really came together.
Q. You've been able to have a lot of confidence over the past few days.  What was the difference today?
ANGEL YIN: Nothing different.  I mean, it's not like I shot 8- or 9-under, but I've just been playing my game and it's just been working well.
Q. So when you were done you went over to the 18 green perch.  What were some the things the Founders were saying about you?
ANGEL YIN: One of them remembered me and it was pretty special, because you don't really meet them all the time.  I played this event three times, so maybe I met them four times.
But it's special to see them there, sitting there watching us play.
Q. You're in contention here tomorrow.  What's the mindset?  How are you going to come up and stand atop the leaderboard?
ANGEL YIN: Nothing different.  This is not my first time, so I'm going to try to do the same I've been doing the past three days and just play my game.  If it works, it works.
