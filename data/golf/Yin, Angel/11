Q. Really good work on the par 5s today, 3 under.  Unfortunately, the bogey on 18.  Give us a little assessment of your round today.
ANGEL YIN: An assessment of today's golf?  I played well.  I kind of took advantage of my distance today and really played low on the par 5s.  Yeah, it was just -- I just came together better, and I felt like I was more in my slot for my golf swing and everything.
It's just unfortunate for 18, but it's a tricky hole location with how dried out the green is.  It's hard to read the breaks.  Even though sometimes it's like a five-footer, it kind of will break.
Q. What do you do now, as things unfold?
ANGEL YIN: I was going to leave, but a lot of people advised me not to leave.  So I am contemplating between leaving and not leaving.
Q. How did the greens change throughout the course of the round?
ANGEL YIN: It got dryer, and it got quicker.  But it was not as fast as I would imagine Sunday to be.  It was quite slow.  I was kind of hammering it -- like hammering, in a definition of a Sunday at the U.S. Women's Open.
Q. When you put yourself in a pretty solid position later in your round, did that change your game plan at all?  Did you want to just post a good score, or did you keep wanting to be aggressive throughout the round?
ANGEL YIN: It didn't really change my game plan.  I was a little unhappy with how I played yesterday.  There was a lot of great chances out there, but I didn't catch it.  I just wanted to play better, kind of like a redemption today, because I knew I could play way better.
It was my first U.S. Women's Open cut I've ever made.  So just -- I didn't expect much.  Just wanted to play well.
