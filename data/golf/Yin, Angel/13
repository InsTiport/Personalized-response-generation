Q. Tell me about your round.
ANGEL YIN: My round, it was good.
Q. Elaborate on that.
ANGEL YIN: (Laughter.)  I made five birdies and then I made a bogey, but I survived and shot 4-under.  Yeah, hit it good, putted good, hit it good, good.
Q. So an easy day?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  It was good.
Q. What do you like about the course?
ANGEL YIN: It's a really good golf course.  I think it's just the setup.  It's just really good.  Just like a really good golf course.
Q. What's your strategy for this golf course?
ANGEL YIN: Drive it far, hit it close, make the putts.  (Laughter.)
Q. How is that different than your strategy every week?
ANGEL YIN: I try to keep it the same so it's simple so I don't get confused with my game plan.
Q. What's your game plan?
ANGEL YIN: Well, see, the difference between this golf course and the other golf courses is that usually you have to plan it out, like 3-wood, 2-iron.  This one is just driver, iron, putt.
Q. Easy.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.
Q. How do you rate your season so far?
ANGEL YIN: 1 to 10 I give it a 4.5, maybe 4.75.
Q. Why so low?
ANGEL YIN: Is that low?  We're only one third of it.  I played good in the beginning; I finished fourth and then gave myself a lot of chances to win a trophy but never was able to close it off.
Didn't have a really good three-week stretch before this break, so 4.75.
Q. Was there anything you were working on during the two-week break?
ANGEL YIN: Nothing exactly.  Just keep practicing.  I was trying to change my shot shape from a draw to a fade this year.  Been working on that more.
Q. Did you see that today?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, yeah, a little bit more.  Less left.
Q. How much is Solheim on your mind every week?
ANGEL YIN: Other than the texts I get every week or every day from Juli, not much.  I try not to think about it.  Just play my golf and get some points for Solheim.
