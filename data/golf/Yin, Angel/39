 Q.  You're going down technically as the clinching putt because Salas is guaranteed a half point now.  So how was your first Solheim?  
ANGEL YIN: Pretty amazing, I have to say.  It's very different.  I've never seen this many people in the crowd before.   
 Q.  Did it affect the nerves?  
ANGEL YIN: No.  Honestly, no.  I just -- well, it made me hit it further than I've ever hit in my life.  Hitting it harder, too.  But I wasn't nervous.  I was just more excited.  The adrenalin.
