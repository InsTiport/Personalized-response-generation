Q. Sum up the day.
ANGEL YIN: Sum up the day?  It was a good day.  (Laughter.)
Q. Short and sweet, like Hemingway.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  It was a good day.
Q. What stood out?
ANGEL YIN: I made a few putts, hit a few shots close.  That's about it.  I mean, it was just a solid round.  I almost made eagle, but if I made that eagle it would have been my highlight.
Q. How do you feel overall about where your game is?
ANGEL YIN: I feel good.  Been fixing my swing in the off-season, so right now feels goods.  Obviously it's not where I want it to be because I still mishit here and there because of my swing change.  Body is not really adjusting; it doesn't want to listen.
Other than that, it's fine.
Q. The swing change, did you do that in the off-season or were you working on that last year?
ANGEL YIN: Yes, off-season, which is beginning of this year.
Q. Can you sum it up in layman's terms what you're doing?
ANGEL YIN: What I'm doing, so I tend to stand up when I come to impact, so I'm trying to stay on top of the ball more.  I'm fixing my right knee.  My right knee likes to bend going forward.  I wanted to straighten a bit more, stabilize, and go left.
And my weight shift, if you look at my pattern on the weight net, it goes back, forward, back, forward.  So I just want it to go back and then forward.
Q. And the object is just be a more consistent ball-striker?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, be over the ball more and have it be more repetitive.  That's all we want.  If you can swing (indiscernible) and do it, shoot 58, I think that is all you need.  That's what I'm trying to do.
