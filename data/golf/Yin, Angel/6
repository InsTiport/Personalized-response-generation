 Q.  Angel, yesterday you gave (indiscernible) away. What did you tell yourself this morning when you came out little better conditions obviously?  
ANGEL YIN: I just gotta take advantage of the weather because yesterday -- I'm not the greatest in the wind -- so it kind of -- I kind of was rattled by that. Today I was just ready to go. I know that every point counts.   
 Q.  In Des Moines, first time around, what's the difference the second time around in the Solheim Cup?  
ANGEL YIN: I mean, nothing's really different. So much adrenaline is going through me. On the last hole, after I made that putt on 16 my legs were shaking, and I was, like, I have to pace it off, pace it off -- keep walking around the tee box. The nerves are always there. You just have to manage it.   
 Q.  Can you take these experiences (inaudible)?  
ANGEL YIN: I think it's going to help.   
 Q.  Every match out there looks tough. Just how tough was that battle?  
ANGEL YIN: I fought. She fought. Then she made three birdies in a row, from 4-up -- 4-down to 1-down. It got me a little rattled.   
And I made the putts I wanted to make. I missed two short putts. But I stuck it out. And she's such a good player and it was such a good match.   
 Q.  The atmosphere has continued to build all day. How difficult is it for all the players to control the adrenaline?  
ANGEL YIN: I mean, there's no secret to it. You just have to do it. Everyone's different it's just there. On 17, the tee shot, my legs were shaking. It's ridiculous. But that's just how it is.
