Q. What was the key to staying bogey-free today?
ANGEL YIN: Lucky breaks. Yeah, I got some lucky breaks today. On 17 -- no, on 16, I chunked my drive. I hit the ground first and then I hit my ball, but it was still pretty far. It was in the fairway, first cut.
Then, you know, 18, hit my second shot, not very well, but it was in a good position. But you know, it was just -- I think I played -- the wind wasn't as bad and I think it's going to get worse.
Q. How tricky was the wind starting to get out there?
ANGEL YIN: It's just that it sometimes gusts and sometimes doesn't. Other than that, the wind direction is pretty consistent, which is nice.
Q. You had a Top-10 here the last time we played this golf course.
ANGEL YIN: Really? Nice.
Q. Do you have good memories playing here or does that -- what do you like about the course?
ANGEL YIN: I just like the setup of the golf course, the way it looks. I think I finished like 20th. It's good to know I finished Top-10. The course, I feel like it fits my eye better.
Q. What specifically?
ANGEL YIN: I just -- it just does.
Q. Fair enough.
ANGEL YIN: Asking so many questions.
Q. You're on your third week of the Asian Swing, one more week to go. How do you feel like you're playing?
ANGEL YIN: How am I coping? Not very well -- just kidding. It's fine because you get to see so many different countries, even though we see them again, we get to explore more of it.
Q. What have you explored this week?
ANGEL YIN: The night market. Food.
Q. Did you go to Taipei 101?
ANGEL YIN: I went there but I didn't go all the way up, because I saw a lot of people in like and I was like, nope, thank you.
Q. So the night market, you'd recommend?
ANGEL YIN: Yes.
