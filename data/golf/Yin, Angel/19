Q. Good day for you today.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.
Q. Really good.  Your front side was the back side you started on, right?
ANGEL YIN: Yes.
Q. What clicked over there for you?
ANGEL YIN: Everything just seemed to be working together.  Yeah, not much.  Putts were dropping.  Was hitting better putts.  Everything just seemed to be working.
Q. First time playing in China on the LPGA.
ANGEL YIN: On the LPGA, yes.
Q. What's it been like for you?  I know you have Chinese heritage.  What's it like being here and playing here?
ANGEL YIN: Feels great.  I can communicate.  It's like being in the States but a little different.  Yeah, I like it here.
Q. Have you gotten to come here to China much in your life?
ANGEL YIN: Yes.  I come here a lot.
Q. How often would you say?
ANGEL YIN: I try to come every year, yeah, at the end of the year.  My grandparents are here, so I just come over here and visit and stay for a month.
Q. Do you play golf while you're here?
ANGEL YIN: No, no, no, no.  Clubs don't even come.  Last year they did because of Dubai.  Came straight from Dubai to here, but usually doesn't come.
Q. Where do your grandparents live?
ANGEL YIN: They live -- it's the center of China.  Just right the center of China.
Q. So distance from here is probably what?
ANGEL YIN: Quite a bit.  Yeah, but just right in the center of China and people know where it is.
Q. Are they watching this week?
ANGEL YIN: Probably not.  I don't think they even know what golf is.  They do.  No, no, they, do, but they don't watch.  I like to keep my job mysterious.
