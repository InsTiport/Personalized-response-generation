 Q.  You were able to birdie that last hole.  What's it like being able to close with a par-3?  
ANGEL YIN: Closing with a par-3, it's definitely something that you don't see every week.  Making that birdie felt really good going into tomorrow.   
I played really well.  Just the last four holes I bogeyed two of them without -- you know, I didn't bogey anything today.   
So having that birdie just really gives a good start going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  A lot of players have been saying that it's nice weather conditions out there for the most part.  How do you think that affected your game today?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, it obviously soothes your feelings when you're playing in nice weather, especially with a lot of palm trees around, a lot of cars, traffic, people yelling fore that's not in the golfing facility.   
Yeah, it's L.A., and you get to see the Hollywood sign on the 9th hole.   
 Q.  For you, this is kind of almost like a hometown feel for you.  
ANGEL YIN: Sort of.  Sort of.  Growing up in Arcadia we don't really come town to L.A.  You know, when people ask where you're from you say L.A., so I've said L.A. enough to feel like home.   
 Q.  You've got some family, friends out here?  
ANGEL YIN: Yes, yes, a few.   
 Q.  Who has joined you?  
ANGEL YIN: Who has joined me?  I don't know.  What do you want to say?  Just write whatever.   
 Q.  Just being in California, being able to compete here, does that help your confidence at all?  
ANGEL YIN: Not really.  Just a golf course and I'm playing golf.   
 Q.  Last year you didn't make the cut, but now you're doing significantly better.  What have you learned from the past mistakes?  
ANGEL YIN: Past mistakes?  I used to hit a draw and now I'm trying to hit a fade around this place.   
I notice if you're hitting it too far it doesn't really help here.   
 Q.  What's the mindset for the rest of the rounds?  
ANGEL YIN: Play like how I did today and just keep playing.
