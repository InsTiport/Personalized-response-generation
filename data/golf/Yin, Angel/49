Q. How did you feel out there today?ANGEL YIN: It was hard.Q. Really?ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  Well, when I played the practice round, I was like, you hit it straight and then hit it on the green, it's going okay, right, it's not going to be too hard.  But today I played, it was just -- I don't know, it was really difficult, especially on the greens.  You putt and it just flies.  They made the greens really fast and firm.  So the ball wasn't really stopping on the green.Q. The Women's Amateur.ANGEL YIN: Yeah.Q. Any particular holes that stood out to you where you played pretty well today?  A couple birdies out there today or --ANGEL YIN: Um, well, on the 10th hole, the first hole, I hit a really good approach shot.  Usually I don't hit it that straight, but that one was pretty good.  It's decent for me.  So I almost got an eagle, but I got a birdie, so it was good.Q. Nice way to start your round?ANGEL YIN: Yeah, it was a good way to start.  The rest was okay.Q. It's just the first day, too.ANGEL YIN: Yeah.Q. Does that come into your mind at all, just trying to get through?ANGEL YIN: Yeah, kind of, because the first day is like kind of knowing the course, because practice round, I feel like practice round and the actual tournament, it's really different.Q. What have you done since Tulsa?  Take some time off?ANGEL YIN: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was going to play Junior PGA, but at the last minute, I decided not to.Q. Have you been hanging out at home?ANGEL YIN: Yeah, at home.Q. How long have you been here in Portland?ANGEL YIN: We drove up the day before the practice round, the official practice round, so we kind of got used to the weather, but it's like LA, so it's really nice.Q. It's perfect out here.ANGEL YIN: Yeah, it's better than Tulsa.
