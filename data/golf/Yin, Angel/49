 Q.  You're at -10; sitting in the top five.  What was working well for you today?  
ANGEL YIN: So at first I didn't play that well.  I was 1-over through 6, I believe.   
Then I just figured out my putting, so made four birdies in a row.  Then stopped a bit, and then I putted well again.  My putting was helping me a lot today.   
 Q.  Three birdies in a row to come home on 9 and then you made par, right?  6, 7, 8, and then 9?  
ANGEL YIN: Yes.   
 Q.  You played on the LET last year.  
ANGEL YIN: Yes.   
 Q.  Do you think that helps, like the experience, translating to your rookie season on the LPGA?  
ANGEL YIN: Oh, yeah.  It matures your game a lot because it's professional golf.  The courses are tighter so you learn to work around course management-wise.  I improved a lot.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be playing so well today in you're rookie season?  
ANGEL YIN: It feels great.  Yeah, feels great.   
 Q.  Have you done anything since Australia?  
ANGEL YIN: Went home and then I ate too much.  I watched my diet, and then that's about it.   
 Q.  Anything in your game?  Working on something recently that is translating out here, or just rolling in some putts?  
ANGEL YIN: I've just been sleeping more.   
 Q.  Okay.  That's a big deal.  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  If I get tired I can sleep for 17 hours.   
 Q.  What?  Straight?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  People think I get up and eat or use the restroom.  I'm like, No.  Straight.   
 Q.  Straight through.  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  It's called hibernation.   
 Q.  Were you not sleeping as much before?  
ANGEL YIN: It's like a power bank.  You need to put some in there.  In the tournament, like my tee time today, 7:00 in the morning.  It's still dark out.  I bring that out and just plug it in and charge it.   
 Q.  What are you averaging in sleep this week?  How many hours?  
ANGEL YIN: I try to get eight.   
 Q.  Eight a night?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Not room for 17 right now?  No, no.  No room.
