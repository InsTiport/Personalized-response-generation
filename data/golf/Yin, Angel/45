 Q.  Could you just talk about your day?  How do you feel about how you played today?  
ANGEL YIN: Today's round was just -- I had a lot of up-and-downs and couldn't hit really a lot of greens in my back nine, which was the front nine.  I putted pretty well.  I didn't really miss anything inside of nine feet except for one, which I think is really good.  Every day when I go out there, my goal for putting is don't miss anything inside nine feet, and I didn't today, so I'm pretty happy with that.  Had a few mis-hits, but I recovered from that, so tomorrow hopefully I hit more fairways.   
 Q.  And what are the major differences in between the course played yesterday and today?  
ANGEL YIN: This morning there's more dew in the rough.  It's a lot wetter.  Greens are rolling smoother than yesterday, so it's easier to putt on.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be playing so well in your rookie season?  
ANGEL YIN: I don't know.  How do I feel?  I feel excited.  Yeah, I feel excited.   
 Q.  Do you feel any pressure to keep going, continue your good play?  
ANGEL YIN: I know I can play well, so I just need to keep doing that.   
 Q.  What's today's hat?  
ANGEL YIN: Sriracha.   
 Q.  What's tomorrow?  What's the weekend hat?  
ANGEL YIN: I don't know.  I don't know yet.
