Q. Here with Angel Yin, 6-under par 65 today at the CP Women's Open.  What were working well for you out there today?
ANGEL YIN: Overall my game was just working well.  I don't think it was one part of my game that was working well, especially well.
And I think it's just -- I've been playing well for the whole year and now I'm scoring.
Q. You're coming into this week off a Top 5 finish at the Indy Women of Tech last week.  Talk about the momentum coming into this week after that result?
ANGEL YIN: Well, it felt good to finish fifth.  And then coming into this week -- yeah, I feel good.  I'm ready for the rest of week.
Q. How important was it get off to a good start today given that the scoring conditions were pretty favorable out there?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, well, I played the pro-am yesterday and it was quite firm, the greens and everything, so I was a little surprised with how the scores were low.
But then I cam out here and I played and I played pretty well, so I didn't complain.
Q. How about the group dynamic today where everybody was going low?  Were you all feeding off of one another?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, the whole group was great.  Everyone played really well.  It was just a great group to have everyone play well.
