Q. This is your best finish in a major.
ANGEL YIN: Thank you.
Q. How does that feel?
ANGEL YIN: I'm happy.  I don't feel much; it's hot.
Q. Are you proud of the way you played this week?
ANGEL YIN: As a matter of fact, yes.  Yes.  I made careless just stupid mistakes, but I was able to make eight birdies to shoot 1-under, and I fought.  I played well.  I almost holed out on the last hole.  Did you hear, it hit the hole, was going to go in the hole, but because of my divot, it didn't go in the hole.  I must have angered someone up there.
Q. How does this set up for you moving forward?
ANGEL YIN: Well, I'm playing better, so I'm going to ride this momentum going into the next two weeks, Wisconsin and Ohio.
