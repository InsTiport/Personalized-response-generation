Q. Please sum up your round for us.
ANGEL YIN: I made a double, two bogies and a lot of birdies to shoot 1-under.  Very quick.  It was the highlight.
Q. What was the highlight of the round?
ANGEL YIN: When I made three birdies in row.  I made like maybe some 20-footers, really cool.
Q. How long was it playing?
ANGEL YIN: What?
Q. How long was it playing?
ANGEL YIN: Distance-wise?  I thought you said time-wise.  Distance-wise, it's all right.
Q. You're one of the longest players on Tour.
ANGEL YIN: I can reach the par-5s in two.  Not all of them.  The majority of them.
Q. Which ones?
ANGEL YIN: I can't remember.
Q. The first one I think is a longest, the third is like 560.
ANGEL YIN: I don't know.  There was one on record that was like maybe 308.  Maybe 560.  I don't know.  There was one on record that was like maybe 308.  So, 308 and 3-wood and bunker and then a bunker out and then birdie.
Q. (Inaudible).
ANGEL YIN: Sort of.
Q. That means you don't have any memories --
ANGEL YIN: I know we won.
Q. Did you hit driver more often than you usually do?
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, for sure.  Yeah.
Q. This is supposed to be a really tough course but I don't hear complaints about it.
ANGEL YIN: From me or other people?
Q. From the players, right.
ANGEL YIN: I think it gets to a point where it's long enough where there's no obstacles in the place so if it was shorter maybe it -- there would be more complaints come out.  Playing so long you can miss it and still be okay.  You just have a really long iron into the green.
Q. It's a fair test.
ANGEL YIN: It's fair.
Q. How tough is the rough?
ANGEL YIN: It's real rough, not the U.S. Women's Open rough.  I can say that.
Q. Is it a tougher test than Charleston?
ANGEL YIN: For sure in the rough.  I have to keep it in the fairways, though.
Q. How do you feel generally about your game coming into where you're at?
ANGEL YIN: I feel like I'm hitting the ball better, striking it better, putting good, chipping good.  Everything good.
Q. (Inaudible)
ANGEL YIN: Just different shafts.  I think maybe 20 grams lighter.  I can't remember.  My memory is going bad.
Q. Why did you do that?
ANGEL YIN: Because I'm getting old and I'm weak.  Age is catching up to me.  I'm turning 21 this year.  Yeah.  Lighter shafts.
Q. On social media you've expressed some frustrations.  Is that your game, what's going on with you?
ANGEL YIN: Skip.  What else?
Q. How much advantage was it for the groups that got out and got round before the wind?
ANGEL YIN: I think it's going to be -- I think it's going to be the same because once the rain -- it will soften up you so there's not much of an afternoon green where usually it's firmer, hard to hold the ball.
If it rains and depending on how much it rains, it's still going to play the same as in the morning.  I don't think there's going to be a difference.
Q. Have you played with anyone that can out-drive you yet on Tour?
ANGEL YIN: Even if they do I won't admit it.  There's no such thing.
Q. Did you arrive here thinking this was my kind of place and then have a good week?
ANGEL YIN: Not really.  I mean I know obviously this course, I have my distance so it can help out.  There's nothing such as I think me having more advantage than other people because everyone out here is good.
Q. You said your entire game feels amazing right now.  Is there any part of your game in particular that you're happiest with?
ANGEL YIN: Happiest with?  Hitting it long and far still.
Q. Are you going to start a podcast?
ANGEL YIN: We're planning.
Q. Who are you planning it with?
ANGEL YIN: My friend Briget and Marina Alex.
Q. Like a cohost.
ANGEL YIN: Three people so we don't get tired.  Non-stop of talking.  Can't wait, right?  Good stuff.
Q. Unplugged?  That's terrifying.
ANGEL YIN: Maybe In The Hole With Friends.
Boom boom
