Q. Here with Angel Yin, a first round 68. Birdie on the final hole. Got to be pretty happy. Great way to finish a round.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, I bogeyed my 2nd hole and it was because I three-putted. The greens were so fast and I didn't adjust. So birdie on the last hole felt good.
Q. Tell us about the golf course out there. Looks wide open. Some pretty good scoring conditions out there. How is it suiting up to you your game?
ANGEL YIN: The course is quite long, and with my distance I can carry most of the obstacles, bunkers and such.
So yeah, the course suits me a little bit better I think I will say.
Q. I was going to say, if this course suits long hitters, is the rest of the field in for some trouble over the next couple days?
ANGEL YIN: I mean, there are scoring opportunities for people who hit it long, short, so it's going to be tough. You have to hold on tight. Yeah, there you go. That's all I got. Hold on tight.
Q. One more. You're going to be up toward the top of the leaderboard tomorrow. What do you do now to go out and prepare for round two?
ANGEL YIN: Have dinner and sleep.
Q. I think that sounds like a really good plan. I'm if for that, too. Just in general, your round. Thought you played well today?
ANGEL YIN: I would say this it wasn't like -- I think everything just worked together. It wasn't like, Oh, wow, I played amazing. Everything worked out well together. I mean, I missed two short birdie putts, so about like nine-footer, ten-footer, something like that.
I still got a lot of opportunities, some lucky rolls here and there. It was just good. It was a good day of golf I would say.
