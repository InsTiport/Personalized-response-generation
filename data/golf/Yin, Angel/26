 Q.  Amy Rogers LPGA.com here with Angel Yin, day one of Ricoh Women's British Open.  Starting with a 3-under 69, how would you describe the round today?  
ANGEL YIN: It was a grind.  It started pouring mid round.  So it was raining really hard.  A local told me yesterday that today was going to be sunny and the hottest day of the week.  Good thing I didn't trust him and I brought an umbrella.  So I was able to managed to pull through and I didn't make a bogey.  So I'm really happy with my round today.   
 Q.  We don't see forces and weather and conditions like this very often on tour.  Do you enjoy this sort of challenge and setup?  
ANGEL YIN: I like the rain, because I don't get it a lot, because I'm from LA.  So it's nice to get rain.  It's good for your skin.  I don't know.  It's just a golf course and you're just trying to play as best as you can.   
 Q.  You've been playing well in the majors.  Obviously played well in the last with a Top 5 finish.  What is it about these tests and these challenges that seems to bring out your best game?  
ANGEL YIN: It's tough, so I know everyone is having it tough.  Scores aren't as low so I don't have to make myself make every putt I have.  I'm just trying to get it on the green, the fairway and then par is a good score.   
 Q.  Great playing today.  Good luck the rest of the week.  
ANGEL YIN: Thank you.   
 Q.  What was the story of your round today?  How would you summarize it?  
ANGEL YIN: I got -- I mean I would summarize it as a grind.  I mean I hit -- I had some really lucky breaks here and there.  I didn't hit a good shot, but I got a lucky kickback on to the green.  I was just trying to play every shot like -- I planned out my shots pretty well, and I was able to execute it today.  So I think that's what really showed up today.  It worked.   
 Q.  The bunkers seem like to be the big story here.  Did you have any adventures in them?  
ANGEL YIN: I did.  I went in a few.  I think I went in two, one on a par-5, one on a par-4.  I was able to make par, so I didn't lose a shot.  I was just trying to get it out.  I didn't really do anything fancy.  I mean Angela was able to hit it out from the fairway bunker on 18.  I don't know if you saw that, but that was pretty amazing.  She got it on the green.  I just used a 60 and chipped it out.   
 Q.  How did you make the birdies on the par-5s?  
ANGEL YIN: I chipped it to a good distance and I made the putt.  I had a chance to get it onto -- I think on like 16, 15 -- 15.  But I like pulled my 2-iron left.  That's a pull; right?   
 Q.  Yes.  
ANGEL YIN: Okay.  I pulled my 2-iron left.  I went in the bushes, but it was all right.   
 Q.  And when we were talking the other day you said that having played the LET, even though you didn't play a lot over here, you're comfortable, you recognize a lot of players.  Right?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, yeah.  I didn't play with any LET players today, though.   
 Q.  No.  But you see them here.  
ANGEL YIN: I see them, yeah.   
 Q.  So you're just comfortable around this kind of environment?  
ANGEL YIN: Oh, yeah.  I'm comfortable.  I try and get comfortable.   
 Q.  And the rain is good for your skin?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  It's good for your skin.   
 Q.  I didn't know that.  I learned something today.  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  I woke up with like a really dry eye.  I thought it was going to pop out.  It was uncomfortable.   
 Q.  The whole eye?  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  The whole eye.  The left one.  But I managed.   
 Q.  You managed to not lose an eye.  
ANGEL YIN: Yeah.  I managed to not lose an eye.
