Q. Just first of all how good to be able to finish two rounds?
ANGEL YIN: Oh, yeah.  To finish two rounds, I didn't think we were able to be -- sorry.  Sorry.
Q. You're so ecstatic to finish two rounds.
ANGEL YIN: Yeah, I was really happy.  Just a little hot, too.  The weather turned out really well.  I thought it was going to be pouring all day today, especially when I looked at the forecast and it said 90% all day.
Today when we played, before our round it just poured a little bit but after that it cleared up.  And the sun is out now and it's really, really, really hot.
Q. What went right for you today?
ANGEL YIN: My putting.  Yesterday I was putting well, but towards the middle of the round to the ending of the round I wasn't dropping as many putts.  It was next to the hole a lot, but I wasn't making them.
Today more of them went in so the score was a little lower.
Q. Is there something about the way you're playing now and this course that makes you think you should be a good contender for the weekend?
ANGEL YIN: This course fits my game really well.  These are kind of the courses I like.  It's like similar to Lake Merced.  A little bit different, but very similar.
I've been hitting it pretty well and putting pretty well, too.  I have a good chance.
Q. Do you think your finish at Lake Merced has boosted you here this week?
ANGEL YIN: Of course.  For sure.  It's like a mental boost.
Q. Tell me about the mental part right now.  You must feel like you're in a pretty good place.
ANGEL YIN: Yeast, I'm in a pretty good place.  I've been working on the things that I wasn't happy with my game, too thrilled about, and it's turning out really well.
So I'm really happy about that.
Q. What are some of those things?
ANGEL YIN: (Laughter.)  Ball control, distance control.  Just shots inside 120 yards.
