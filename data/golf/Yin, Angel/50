 Q.  Do you feel like any momentum carried over from the Girls' Junior or any confidence?  ANGEL YIN: Definitely confidence, but I don't know, maybe momentum, I don't know, because I didn't play golf for three days after I went back home, so I took a break, which is good.   Q.  What was it about this course that kind of fit your eye?  You're leading right now.  What was it?  ANGEL YIN: Well, I came to this course, and I was like -- I feel like it's just a bit longer so I can actually pull out my driver more than the Girls'.  I think I used my driver four times max at Girls', but I think I used it almost every single hole here except for two.   Q.  And what about the greens because everyone is saying the greens are pretty tough here, that fairways are tight and greens are tough.  How are you seeing the greens?  ANGEL YIN: The greens are really tough.  Yesterday, my first round after I finished, I was like, it's nothing like the practice round.  The practice round was slow, but then the tournament, it's fast and it's firm.  Yesterday on the 18th hole, I had a putt 90 degrees, and it went in the hole.  I was like praying.  Mostly just like I'm trying to putt every single putt I have.   Q.  What would it mean for you to be medalist if the scores hold?  ANGEL YIN: Well, it would be pretty cool because I was medalist last year at the U.S. Girls', so to be medalist at the Women's Am, which I think is the biggest event of the year for me, I think mostly all the amateurs, too, because everyone who plays well comes -- Ellen Port, Mariah Stackhouse -- I can't name others.   Q.  But it would be pretty cool?  ANGEL YIN: It would be pretty cool, yeah.  Bottom line is it's pretty cool.   Q.  You kind of brought them up, Ellen, Mariah.  Do you think about Curtis Cup at all?  ANGEL YIN: Yes, yes, I do.  But I don't think -- I'm not good enough to get in.  I mean, I don't know.  I want to get picked.  I'd be pretty happy.  Actually at the U.S. Girls', I think it was Robin Burke, she came up to me, so it was pretty cool to meet her.   Q.  Tell us about your round today.  How many birdies did you have out there today?  ANGEL YIN: I had six with two bogeys.   Q.  Any of those birdies really stand out to you?  ANGEL YIN: Let me think.  Gosh.  I have a horrible memory.  I don't know.  Ooh, I think, okay, on the back nine -- I played well.  I was 4-under through like six holes, and then I just couldn't play -- I don't know, I couldn't play.  I was just like, I didn't play as well.  And then on the back nine, I think my first birdie, which was like a -- I don't know what hole it was, but it was downhill.  It was a hole where I saw Natalie.  I think it was the 12th hole.  I saw Natalie Gulbis and I was like freaking out, and I was like, oh, my gosh, she's here.  I made my putt.  It was completely downhill and I thought it was a pretty hard putt, so I thought I was going to two-putt it, but it went in, so I was pretty happy.  But Natalie was there and I made the putt.   Q.  Little show-off moment?  ANGEL YIN: Yeah, it worked out.   Q.  Nothing wrong with that.  ANGEL YIN: Yep.   Q.  I heard you say or maybe your mom said before some of the courses at the junior level are set up maybe even too short for you because you're such a long hitter.  You said you were hitting your driver more.  How quickly when you get to a tournament do you think about the yardage, look at the yardage?  ANGEL YIN: The moment where I start playing the practice round because sometimes it could say 6,300, but when I play it, you still have to lay up a lot, and there's so many hazards where if you hit it 260, 270 there's a bunker or there's a water hazard, so all the hazards are in the way.  But on this course there's less hazards.  I can't say there isn't, but there's less.   Q.  What's like the ideal yardage for you?  Where do you feel like you're in your wheelhouse for a course?  ANGEL YIN: A course?  I don't know.  I don't really know.   Q.  It seems like you kind of become friends with everyone you play with.  Is that true or is that just what we've seen?  ANGEL YIN: I have no idea.  I don't know.  I just like to talk a lot, which is not good when we play tournaments, but I hope I don't bother them.  But all the players I've played so far are really nice, and they're cool.  Even though they're in college, they're really nice to me.  It's really nice.  I think I meet great people.  That's why.   Q.  Do you think you've always been that way or has it gotten easier the older you've gotten?  ANGEL YIN: I definitely have to say it got easier as I got older.  I don't know.  My mom always said I talked a lot but I didn't think I talked as much when I was younger.  Maybe I talk more now.  I don't know.   Q.  Do you ever ask any of the college players any tips, anything, or do you just kind of chat?  ANGEL YIN: To be honest, when we talk, we talk about the most random things.  I don't know.  I sometimes do.  I ask them about what to do like when you're in college and stuff.  Yeah.   Q.  Any ideas where you're going to go yet?  ANGEL YIN: Yes, I do, actually.  But I'm going to stay in southern California.   Q.  So at least you've narrowed it down to the city, huh?  ANGEL YIN: Yes, LA, to the city of LA.
