 Q.  Came down to the last hole. What was the difference in the match?  
PATRICK REED: I think the biggest thing was that they made a couple more putts than we did, and you know, we ultimately bogeyed 9 and they were able to win a hole with par. That hole alone, you know, is the difference of being all-square than down. You know, in a format like this, you just can't make bogeys and unfortunately neither of us were able to convert.   
 Q.  Know you didn't think this would be easy, but you guys are down 4-1 heading into tomorrow. What about the Internationals show the United States today?  
WEBB SIMPSON: I think like Patrick said, they just made a few more putts than we did. I don't know what went on in the other matches but our guys got off to a fast start birdieing 2, 3, 4, 5, and we brought it back. Patrick made an unbelievable birdie on 16 but we just didn't get it done.   
 Q.  Was the Aussie crowd respectful, and did you get what you expected?  
PATRICK REED: It's exactly what I expected.   
WEBB SIMPSON: Undeserved. Undeserved.   
 Q.  Heading into tomorrow with what the Internationals did today, what kind of attitude did you need to bring to the golf course?  
PATRICK REED: A lot, a lot of attitude and I think our guys are hungry. I think we're pretty upset with how the day went on as a whole and as a group.   
WEBB SIMPSON: I think we have to come out ready to go tomorrow. We're at a big deficit. A lot of golf to be played but we have to regroup and figure out what pairings he's going to send out. We need their kind of day tomorrow for us.
