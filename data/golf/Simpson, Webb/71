Q. Webb, not much going on the front nine, but excellent back nine.  Comment on your day and a great finish.  I know 17 is a little disappointing, but still a great finish.
WEBB SIMPSON: I feel like my week this week was kind of a lot of birdies, and I just made mistakes.  Yesterday was pretty clean.  I still made a bogey yesterday.  Overall making a lot of birdies, which is a good sign.  I always love making birdies.  I feel like I can clean up the bogeys easier than trying to make birdies if I'm not making birdies.
All that to say it's a good start to the year.  Playing next week, so excited to tee it up again.
Q. I sense the optimism.  You're looking forward to the rest of this year?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I am.  I feel like last year a lot of things came together.  Finally saw some hard work bring some fruit, and getting to Atlanta is always a good feeling.  Played a couple times in the fall, played solid.  Yeah, I was kind of -- I had six, seven weeks off, and I was ready to get back out here.
