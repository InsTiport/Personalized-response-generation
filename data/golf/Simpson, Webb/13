Q. Eagle at the last, maintained your position going to Chicago.  Thoughts on the week?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I got better every day.  Every day we improved our position a little bit and that's a good sign.  I did that last week in Greensboro.  It was one of those weeks where I felt like it was a solid-through-the-bag kind of week, nothing really let me down.  Not too many mental mistakes and I really got it going, Dustin and Harris shooting these low numbers, I never got a low one in there but very confident leaving here.
Q. You've won on this golf course with a score very similar to what you've shot this week and yet there are guys that are shooting eight, 13 shots better.  How impressed are you about Harris and DJ, especially?
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's incredible.  Dustin is having one of those career tournaments.  This will be his 22nd win, but this is like as good as it gets.  I'm assuming he'll get to 30-under.  It's not easy.
I know there was a bunch of talk this week, I heard, from guys, that people thought this course was too easy.  It's not too easy.  Any time you give a PGA TOUR player soft greens, which they had a bunch of rain I heard right before we got here and a lot of rain yesterday, soft greens give us good scores.
I mean, historically, it always has and the rough wasn't as long this week as it normally is.  So you put those two together, and that's why I think we're seeing some of the scores we're seeing.  And, you've got to give the guys credit.  The course might be easier than normal but a 59 is a 59 and 60 is a 60 and 30-under is 30-under on the PGA TOUR.
