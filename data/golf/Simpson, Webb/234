  Q. (Recording in progress.)  
 WEBB SIMPSON: You know, we putted well. We didn't make a ton, but we did putt well. Got a little lazy with the driver on the back nine but shot 3-under, so that's a good sign.   
 If I would've just taken care of the par-5s, we would have had a great day. So I'm in good position going into the weekend. Going to try to shoot low in the morning and get right back in it.  
  
  Q. Aside from the tournament itself, it's pretty good at theatre to have the two of you guys together the first two days. Do you get a sense of that?   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, absolutely. There was a lot of people that came out and watched because they want to see the outcome of the Money List and all that.   
 But it's been fun. I think we're going to be close to each other and probably playing together tomorrow. Still a lot of golf to be played.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like one of you has to be more aggressive than the other? Do you get the sense you can kind of play your game and then you've got to wait for him to try and make a move?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: You know, I think both of us are in the same mindset and trying to win the golf tournament. We want to beat not only each other, but we want to beat the field. I feel that's just natural as competitors.   
 So, no, yeah, he's got a little further to go. All it takes is a good weekend and he would be right there.  
  
  Q. If the season ended today, who do you think the Player of the Year would be?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: I don't know. There's been a few guys that had great years, so I know who I... (recording skipped ahead.)   
  
  Q. If either one of you win this week, is it case closed, it's over?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Not necessarily. You know, we've both I think played consistent enough to be talked about and be compared on paper. It's been a similar year. We'll see what happens.   
 It's going to be fun to see what happens this weekend. I'm sure it'll help one of us if we play well.
