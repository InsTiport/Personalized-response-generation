Q. In terms of conditions tomorrow, do you think the sort of tougher test is tomorrow, do you think?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I've always enjoyed when it's tougher, when it's firm, and I hear the wind's going to blow a little bit.  So I'm excited for that challenge.  It gives us situations where we have to be really fully committed to what we're trying to do.
Q. Do you expect the leaders to be too far ahead?
WEBB SIMPSON: We'll see.  They're playing great.  I haven't seen quite where they are, but I'm sure they're keep making birdies coming in.
Q. It was quite still a few hours ago.
WEBB SIMPSON: It's picking up a little.  But still not what we saw early in the week.  Like I said, pins are not easy, but they'll make a few birdies coming in probably.
Q. Could be quite a quandary for the officials tomorrow because everyone is expecting sort of the tough weather.  So they're going to have to be quite careful with what they do with these pins.  How do you feel they'll do?
WEBB SIMPSON: I think they'll do a good job.  This is my seventh or eighth Open Championship, and I've never seen one bad pin or bad setup.  I think they'll be prepared for it.
