Q.   If you can just talk us through what you noticed or what you may have observed with Tiger Woods. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   I didn't really notice anything.   I wasn't paying much attention, but it looked like he made a swing on 12 that really hurt.   But didn't say a whole lot.   Class act.   Shook my hand.   Off he went. 

Q.   What did he say to you when he shook your hand and told you he was WD'ing?
WEBB SIMPSON:   He just said he's got to be done.   It looked like he was in some pain.   But I think his‑‑ maybe his heel was bothering him or something, something with his foot.   I don't think his‑‑ I don't think it's anything serious, but you know, like I said, we didn't talk or anything so I'm not sure exactly what it was.

Q.   Did you see him grimace or anything at any point?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Only on that tee shot.   That was the only one that I noticed.   Yeah, that was the only one that I noticed, that he got upset.

Q.   You didn't notice anything different about his swing during the round at all? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not really.   But you know, it was a tough day out there; so I was trying to pay attention to what I was doing.   So I didn't notice a whole lot about whether he was grimacing or not, or what kind of swings he was making.   So I don't know if it was bothering him before or not.

Q.   What did he say to you when he left?
WEBB SIMPSON:   He just shook my hand and said, I've got to go in," just because he ‑‑ you know, you could tell he was hurting.   He didn't say a whole lot, but his expression was enough that, you know, he was in enough pain to end it. 

Q.   Looked like he changed shoes at the turn; right?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, he changed at the turn.   I guess the first pair was bothering him or something.   Yeah, I mean, hopefully he won't be out for long.   Hopefully he'll be at Bay Hill.

Q.   How tough was it on you when it seemed like half the crowd left once he left? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was a bit weird.   It went from one extreme to the other, from playing with all the people to playing with no people.   It was fine; I wasn't playing too good, so I didn't really care.
