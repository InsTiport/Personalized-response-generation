   WEBB SIMPSON: Had a shrank on 3 which I hadn't done in a while. Just one of those things where you got to tell yourself to stay patient, there's plenty of birdie holes. 
 Fortunately, I was able to turn it around. The eagle on 5 really helped. Birdied 6 and 7. Once I made the eagle and a couple of birdies, kind of the start was in the past and played solid on the back.

 Q. What's your approach as we get ready for The Playoffs next week?
 WEBB SIMPSON: You know, I'm just trying to focus on this week right now. Obviously with the FedExCup Playoffs coming up in the back of my mind, really trying to stay fresh, keeping the body in good shape because we've got a lot of golf coming up. 
 I'm excited for The Playoffs. It's the most exciting time for us players all year. So I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. You played well here a year ago. What about this golf course suits your game?
 WEBB SIMPSON: I think it's similar to the style of golf course I grew up on here, North Carolina, and I love the greens here. They're true, they're great. This year I think they're better than ever. 
 You know, you can hit a lot of different clubs off the tees. Kind of a fun course to play. There's no one way to play it.
