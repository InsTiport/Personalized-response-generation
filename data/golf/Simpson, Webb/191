 Q.   Bubba Watson, Webb Simpson, wonderful play today, 10‑under par.   How much of this, Webb, do you think was attributable to how well you two played together last year at the Presidents Cup?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think we do a lot from the‑‑ we were good friends before the Presidents Cup, and we went into it wanting to get to know each other better, and we just played great.   I just kind of thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because this was my first Ryder Cup and I was scared to death, so I drew a lot of strength from Him, so I'm thankful.
