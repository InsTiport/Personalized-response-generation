Q.   Keegan, as a NewEngland's guy and skier in Vermont, you know what it's type to play in those types of conditions in that sport, but in this sport and these types of conditions, do you think the best thing to do is to call it a day and see where we are on Monday, or do you think it's okay to go out and play in conditions that are off and on like we've seen so far? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think it's important to make sure the golf is fair.   On the greens sometimes, the ball is not staying still and that's when it gets a little dicey.   You don't want to see somebody get an unlucky gust and the ball roll off the green or something like that. 
CHARLIE BELJAN:   Off the first tee, I hit two into the garbage and after I lost one and hit another one, I punched out on the fairway from 102 yards and I hit an 8‑iron, which I normally hit about 170, 175 on a normal day. 
But the wind was so strong, as Tommy Gainey was getting ready to hit, I pointed at my ball on the green because it was about 20 feet from the pin and it started rolling and getting closer and closer to the hole and that was to my advantage. 
You know, I mean, right now, if you were to go back out there, got seven feet downhill downwind and I can't say I've ever tried to lag from seven feet but I think that's what would be happening.
We all want to play and we're here at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions here in Maui, beautiful place and we all want to play but unfortunately conditions are not allowing it.   You can't even really make a backswing or into the wind because it will knock you over.   I know a couple of guys sat there for five minutes trying to tee up the ball and really just walking into this wind is a chore in itself. 

Q.   Webb, you were the biggest loser in the first try in the first round on Friday, 3‑under par when scores were wiped out, do you think they will do that again today? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think they will.   They give it a good shot but I think more bad things are happening today than the first round. 
So it's unfortunate.   I mean, it's sunny now, finally no, rain, and we wanted to get out there and at least try it and that's what we did.   I've already heard a few stories of balls going over the green.   I think they will probably wash it but we'll see.

Q.   You were 1‑over par for the five holes you played today, and 3‑under through seven the first day.   Seems as though you feel pretty comfortable and you're not making it look difficult?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, on 10, I got a little gust on my backswing but other than, that I was doing what I was doing in the first round, keeping the ball in front of me.   It's hard to make putts. 
That's the hardest thing is making putts.   I mean, you don't know if the gust is going to come or not, so that was‑‑ nobody is probably making putts out there, but yeah, I was kind of keeping it in front of me.   Kuchar and I were having a good time. 

Q.   The conditions were pretty tough with the rain the first day, but this is even blowing harder, don't you think?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I think this is the hardest we have got yet.   It seems like the first day was a cake walk compared to today.   But I mean, you know, they are trying to get us to play some golf.   You know, Matt and I were kind of hanging in there out there, and it was fun, but you don't want to see stupid things happen.   I think that was what they were starting to see. 

Q.   The fact of really more than anything is now that with no rain, it's drying out and even though the greens are slower, they are dryer and that's the big issue.
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, that's what we were thinking before, the sun is coming out, the greens are maybe a little quicker, and it doesn't take much for this course to dry out.   
So that was the foreseen problem and I think that's what we are seeing out there.

Q.   How much do you think it cost to build a roof over this place?
WEBB SIMPSON:   A lot (laughs).
