 Q.  Webb, did you think you had a chance at the start of the day, 11-under, possibly tie the lead at 18?  
WEBB SIMPSON: No. I thought it was going to take lower than that. I played solid today, gave myself chances, but just couldn't really get it close to the hole coming in.   
That was probably going to end up being the difference.   
 Q.  Obviously the difference today, kind of rained all day, which complicated things.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was tough. Wind blew less today, but the rain, like you said, made it harder. The greens were even softer and spinnier, so, yeah, it was hard to get it really close to the hole and have good looks for birdie.
