  WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, I played well all day.   I made nothing.   I thought I hit, you know, all my lines on the greens except for one hole, No. 11, I pushed it but after I three-putted 16, I was still confident with the putter. 
I got to figure out a way to get it done tomorrow.   I got to figure out a way to score and make putts and -- but, you know, one of those things, the birdies make the bogies disappear.

Q.   You played enough golf.   The frustration, so many good looks there three, four holes in a row and couldn't get it in there.
Is that frustrating to you at all?
WEBB SIMPSON:   It does a little bit.   I found myself trying to push and try to make birdies.   Maybe that's why it happened on 16.   Just one of those things where, you know, in a week of golf you're going to have days where you struggle and maybe you can get it at 2-under and today that's what I needed, I needed a couple under but it was a big save on 18, I think. 
At least I'm 4 back, I guess.   So 4 back is a lot better than 5 back.   See what happens.

Q.   Tee shot on 15, obviously you would like to have that back.
WEBB SIMPSON:   Just a bad swing.
