Q.   You were spot on yesterday.   What was going on today?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I just had a bad start.   Kind of hitting it both ways.   Found a pretty good rhythm there in the middle of the round.   Couldn't get any putts to drop.   Little off all day.   Kind of got it back a little bit to 2-under and stupid to bogey the last but just one of those days.   I hung in there, which was good.

Q.   Seemed like the golf course is really firming up.
WEBB SIMPSON:   It really is.   I think with no rain this weekend we're going to see a fast golf course.

Q.   Does that make 7-under a good position going into the weekend?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think it does.   I don't think anybody is going to get too deep this week.   As long as I can go out and play a good solid round tomorrow, I'll have a chance on sun.

Q.   I haven't asked you about it because I really don't want to.   There's a lot of Ryder Cup implications for both you and Sneds.   Have you guys talked about it?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think we're both in a position where we got to play good the next few weeks and we're trying not to think about it, trying to focus on this week but it's definitely in the back of our minds.

Q.   You guys might get to do it again tomorrow.
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I hope so.
