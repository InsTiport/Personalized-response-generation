 Q.   Webb, talk about your day.  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was a great day except for one hole, probably just rushed that putt, ran it 6 feet by and missed it.   Other than the double, I played a good, solid round.  
   
 Q.   Talk about knowing that you had to go really low every hole knowing you couldn't give any back.   How does that sort of go into your mentality with each hole?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's tough because you know you really have to play aggressive and you can't really afford to make any mistakes for a guy in my position.   I needed to have a clean card and I was close.   17 holes without a bogey and one double.   That was kind of the momentum coming for me.  
   
 Q.   Talk about those picking up for The Playoffs.  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I finished, make a few birdies coming in which is good and played solid all week which is what I wanted to do, you know, especially FedExCup Playoffs and the Ryder Cup coming up.   So, all in all, a good week.   My confidence is building so that's always good.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday you said somebody was going to run out of the pack and post a number.  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah.   I mean the course was getable today.   The weather was perfect.   We had no wind.   The ball was going a long way.   I knew 6, 7-under was out there.   I was close to doing it, just one hole.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned Ryder Cup.   You didn't get the win.   What does this do for your Ryder Cup?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Brandt and I both, we showed that our game is in good form and, you know, we got two more weeks to show them we're ready to play.   Hopefully I can keep the play up for the remainder of the time that we have.
