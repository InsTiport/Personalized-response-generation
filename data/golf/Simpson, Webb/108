  WEBB SIMPSON:   Should have birdied 15, had a tough lie.   But nice birdie on 13. 
And it's starting to blow out there.   I think it's going to play tough for the guys this afternoon.   Like I said, I'm pretty happy with where I'm at.

Q.   With the short putter, you've adjusted pretty nicely.   Does this solidify that move?   I know it's been a while.   You really can't think about anymore, can you?
WEBB SIMPSON:   This game is misleading.   One week you feel like you're the best player, and the next week you feel like you're the worst player.   I'm trying NOT to look too into whether I feel good or bad, just keep practicing and getting better.

Q.   Tomorrow afternoon, you've got to go out and do the same thing you did today?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah.   The temperatures and it could blow a little bit like this, or lay down.   Around this place, you just want to be ready for whatever Mother Nature throws at you.
One shot at a time, one hole at a time, is better nowhere else than here.

Q.   You and Bill are both in the top 10?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I showed him the picture before we teed off of me and him back in college.   I guess Deacon Sports or something.   I'm glad he played well.
