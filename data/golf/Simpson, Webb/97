 Q. Describe today.  
WEBB SIMPSON: It was a bit frustrating. I felt like my game was there we were a little timid with some iron shots on the front. One 3-putt on the back.   
Other than that, I played really good today. It was a frustrating day because the game was there. 17 wasn't that hard to get to and, you know, I'm disappointed now. Lot of positives from this week.  
   
 Q. You seem frustrated but you say you are playing well and you're moving into the FedExCup Playoffs now. What momentum do you feel like you're taking from Greensboro to the Barclays?  
WEBB SIMPSON: A lot. I hit it poorly at Akron and the PGA Championship. That's come around. And, you know, I got a new putter this week. I'm working on it trying to get better and, you know, saw some good results even on the greens. Had a few 3-putts but, overall, you know, to finish 6th place you know in a PGA TOUR event is a good thing. I got to keep on working.
