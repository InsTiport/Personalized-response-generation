 Q.  (No microphone.)  
WEBB SIMPSON: This golf course got even more firm than you planned on, so it was a tough day. I didn't have my best stuff, but I hung in there, and to birdie the last two holes gave myself a chance. Tony hit a great putt in regulation. And hats off to him. He played great.   
 Q.  How tough is it, obviously, you and Tony are friends and you've been teammates, how tough is it out there really when you ultimately beat a friend?  
WEBB SIMPSON: It's hard. He is a great friend. Our wives are friends and he's one of the best guys on TOUR. So it is a bit tough. You never want to see a guy play poorly. You hope you both play well and you hope you win by one, is kind of what we all feel. But he's going to win many golf tournaments and it's fun to go -- at the same time, it's fun to go head-to-head with a good buddy.   
 Q.  Still going for the 49ers tonight?  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah.
