Q. Webb, how did you feel out there today?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I played well.  I didn't score as well as I would have liked.  This kind of humidity, I guess it's a front coming in, it's kind of made things -- the conditions pretty benign.  Greens are soft.
You know, my speed was a little off on the greens, but other than that it was a good solid day.  Scores are going to be a little bit low today, but I know we've got tough weather coming.
Q. You mentioned scores being a little low.  Did that surprise you at all?
WEBB SIMPSON:   No.  It would have surprised me yesterday if you had told me what the scores would be, but with these conditions, you can feel kind of the humidity in the air, and the greens are really soft.  We're hitting 5-irons that aren't releasing much.  I don't know if they wanted them soft on purpose with cooler temperatures and the wind coming, but they're certainly softer today than they were when I got here Tuesday.
Q. And then early in the week J.T. talked about this being fun.  He said it was going to be a different kind of fun.  Did it feel that way?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I don't know if I would use "fun."  I enjoy the grind of it.  It's a different kind of golf, and I do enjoy it.  I don't know if I would use the word "fun" like he did, but he's obviously had more fun than me today.
But I like playing tournaments where 18-under doesn't win.  Whatever it's going to be this week, it's not going to be 18-under.  So I do enjoy it.
