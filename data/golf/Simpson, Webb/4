  Q. Not how you wanted to finish it off on 18.  At what point did you start looking and did you have a number in mind?
 WEBB SIMPSON:   We started looking around the turn just to get a gauge with how the leaders played on the front.  But I started the back nine really slow, made a mistake on 11 and made a long putt on 13.  When I parred 14 and 15, I knew I had to probably birdie the last three at least.  Then I birdied 16, 17.  18, perfect drive.  Tried to hit a cut 3-wood which is slightly awkward for me and I just hit a bad shot.
 Q. You never know what's going to happen but a good charge.  What do you take away from two weeks in Hawai'i and how does it set you up for 2021?
 WEBB SIMPSON:   We're almost there with the golf swing.  I feel like I made a lot of putts this week.  Putting's good.  I just need to be a little sharper I think with my approaches to have a good next tournament.
 But all in all, it's been a good two weeks considering I went through COVID and I was able to play.
 Q. Did you have a number in mind when you came out?
 WEBB SIMPSON:   Not really.  I knew probably it had would have been low 60s, but we didn't know what the weather was going to do.  Looked like it was going to be windy, maybe some rain.  So I never really try to get too fixed on a number.  I just want to come out and play good, solid golf and at least make a charge and put some pressure on the guys.
 Q. Did you feel like you left a couple out there?
 WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, for sure.  Made a bad swing on 4.  Made bogey there.  Hit the wrong club.
 11, not my best shot.  Went over.  Only place you can't go on 11 is over.  So those two shots, and then 18, I was in the middle of the fairway trying to cut a 3-wood which is not my favorite shot but I felt like I had to in that moment and I made a bad swing.  Other than that I played really nice.
 Q. How would you assess your two weeks here coming off COVID?
 WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, very thankful to be able to play these two weeks.  I love coming to both tournaments.  The game is almost there.  I think going into Phoenix, there's a few things I want to work on the next two weeks to be sharp there but I think I'm really close to kind of eliminating some of these loose shots.
