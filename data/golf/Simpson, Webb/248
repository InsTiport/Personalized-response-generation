 Q. 9-under par and then just comment first of all about your round today. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was a good day. I made a lot of putts to kind of hang in there and made a few good putts for birdie, but overall it was solid. I need to iron out my tee shots a little bit, and I think I'm close. I'm hoping I can dial it in right now on the range and go get 'em tomorrow.

 Q. Do you expect it's going to be a shootout? Does this course lend itself to that?
 WEBB SIMPSON: I think the weather projection is it's supposed to blow, so I don't think so. Scores aren't great today. 

 Q. Is it easy on a course like this to make up some ground?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I think if you're within six shots you can hang in there. We saw Tiger made a huge run last year. He was probably six or seven back. You know, the wind helps players in my position because we can go out there and shoot a good round and make it tough for the guys who are in the lead trying to kind of protect it.
