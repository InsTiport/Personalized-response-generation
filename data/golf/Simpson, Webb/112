Q.   Do you think about the fact that you put yourself in position or the fact you came up just short?
WEBB SIMPSON:   A little bit of both.   Honestly, through 12 holes I wasn't even close to thinking about winning the tournament or even being in contention.   I was just trying to stay there mentally and try to make a couple birdies coming in, and all of a sudden I eagle 16 and I looked and I was only one back, and then I birdied 17, and it was like, wow, then beautiful drive on 18, and to be honest with you, I thought I hit a good second shot.   I never thought it had to go, and it landed a yard or two short and made bogey from there.   Yeah, it's a sour way to finish after making that run on the back nine. 

Q.   Still a good way to start the season?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I think so.   The game is there.   It's really fun to get in contention and hit good shots, and that's what we were able to do the last few holes.   That's always a huge positive.   I can't dwell on bogeying the last, and I might be a little bit more in a bad mood if I bogeyed the last to lose a playoff by one, but it looks like I'm going to be a few short anyways.
