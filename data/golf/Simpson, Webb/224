 Q. You had it all-square through 16, just talk about the day today as a whole. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: It was a tough start. You know, we hit it great all day. Never really could get putts to drop. I made a couple nice ones there the middle of the round. But K.T. played great, and you know, when a guy is making as few mistakes as he did, it's tough to beat him.

 Q. Just talk about your experience of the week as a whole, your first time playing in a team competition as a professional. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: It's been great. It's been an honor to make the team and to represent the United States and had my wife here, which was really special for me, and you know, it was nice to get it started the way we did making -- getting those few wins early in the week with Bubba. It's been a blast and hopefully we can finish off strong.
