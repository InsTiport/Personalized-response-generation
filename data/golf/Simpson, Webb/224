 Q.   Just talk a little bit about your round.   Nice start to the season.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, it was good, man.   Played nice and solid, hit a bunch of good shots, putted really well.   I missed a five‑footer on 15 and a five‑footer on the last, but to be honest, I hit two really good putts, especially 18.   The green just got a little grainy.   It's tough to make everything out here with the wind blowing.   But overall really happy with the start.  
   
 Q.   Talk about taking that first swing of the new year and how that feels to be back at it.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It feels great.   I looked at my caddie on the second hole, or he looked at me and said, this feels nice to be back at work and playing again.   It was a good feeling to get back in the game and start grinding again.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on the golf course?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Golf course is beautiful.   The wind, I think we're going to have a similar wind all week.   Being a first‑timer here, if that happens, it'll help me, I think.  
   
 Q.   Any comments on the stuff they were talking about with Nick?   Were you involved in any conversations?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, the rules staff, they do such a great job here protecting the players, and they're just trying to protect the field, but I've known Chad Reynolds for a while now, and I know there was nothing going on there.   I thought maybe something just looked suspicious that wasn't really anything.
