 Q.  Really solid round of golf.  I'm so impressed with your putting because for awhile, I don't want to say you were lost, but you were struggling on the greens and for your stroke to be this good, I saw you made a 67-footer from the fringe.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, that was nice.  Yeah, the putting's been good and consistent for awhile and that was what was missing was the consistency piece.  It was rare that I was putting together four good rounds of putting in a tournament.  And I started doing that about a year and a half ago.  Since then the putts are going in and scores are lower and I'm having more fun.   
 Q.  The big difference I guess is confidence and it's such a difficult thing to get, but you can't get confidence until you make some and you can't make some putts until you have confidence.  But you can see that confidence on the greens.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it does feed off each other.  I went from hoping to make putts, to thinking I'm going to making them, to believing that I'm going to make them and that's a good change for me.  Because we don't hit it good every day, so when you don't hit it good if you're putting well it will bail you out and keep you in the golf tournament.
