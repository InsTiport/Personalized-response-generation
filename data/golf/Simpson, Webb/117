 Q.  It has to be disappointing first match?  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, we just -- you've got to make birdies.  On -- neither one of us making birdie was tough.  We got off to a rough start.  But, yeah, it's disappointing.   Q.  What was it like for you being the first group off?  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I actually felt pretty good, to be honest.   Q.  You obviously have played well, you played well at Medinah, you played well in the practise rounds.  Were you surprised today?  WEBB SIMPSON: Seemed like our games were there, just never made any putts.   Q.  Talk about Stenson and Justine.  WEBB SIMPSON: Justin made a few putts; Henrick made a few good birdies and they were a good team today
