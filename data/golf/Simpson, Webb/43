 Q.  (In progress.)  
WEBB SIMPSON: They love golf here.  I think Canadian golf is in such a great place.  So many Canadians in the field.  I think, what, 26?   
 Q.  Yep.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Great Canadians on the PGA TOUR playing well.  I think it's a great time not only for Canadian golf, but this golf tournament.  Great names here.  Good field.   
It's been a while for me to be here, so I'm happy to be back.   
 Q.  Tell us about the round.  
WEBB SIMPSON: It's always nice to play a round with no bogeys.  Had to save par a few times.  It's funny how golf is.  I shot 3-under on the first nine but hit it a lot better on the second nine and shot 1-under.   
Overall through the bag it was a pretty solid day.  Had a great group playing with Rory and Kuch.  They played great.  Fun day.   
 Q.  How soft was the golf course out there?  Was it very attackable?  
WEBB SIMPSON: It was soft and attackable, but less soft than I thought it would be.   
Greens were still bouncing, and so I think with today's weather and the rest of the week it'll firm out nice.
