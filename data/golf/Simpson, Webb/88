Q. Have you been through this experience before and how do you mentally prepare?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, for guys out there today, I was playing pretty good and had to stop.  But it's just the way it goes.  Hopefully tomorrow it can pick back up in that rhythm.  Tomorrow doesn't look good but hopefully we can get it done.
Q. Anxious to get back out there?  You were a couple under.
WEBB SIMPSON: Absolutely.  I know the leaders didn't even have a chance to tee off.  Still a lot of golf to play.  We'll see what the golf course will be like tomorrow.  It was starting to dry out today.
Q. What's your game plan now?
WEBB SIMPSON: Just go back and get some rest.  Got an early morning for tomorrow.  Hopefully we'll be able to play.  But you know, it's one of those things, I've got to come out ready to go.
