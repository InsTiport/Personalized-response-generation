 Q. Are you trending in the right direction?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you know, it was a really good day. Last two days have been great. Today was more, you know, I said -- I gave myself plenty of opportunities. When I missed greens, I was able to chip them pretty close and again get up-and-down. 
 And the one dropshot, 16, bad swing and I had a tough spot for an up-and-down. But it was good to finish with a birdie, and I like where I'm at.

 Q. Certainly playing in perfect conditions. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, we've had perfect conditions all week. Last two weeks, really. So looks like tomorrow will be good again. I'm sure scores will be low as well.

 Q. Are you feeling pressure on your game? Obviously you've taken care of a lot of things in your rookie season. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, there no pressure. All this is great. You know, I want to win so I'm still hungry, but it's just nice to play a few tournaments with not much to worry about.

 Q. Talk about the golf course yielding those scores. Three back right now. Some courses that's a lot. It's not much here. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I mean, there's birdie holes right off the bat, 1, 2, 4, 6. So, you know, if I can just go out and make a few birdies early and put pressure and give myself a chance, anything can happen coming in.

 Q. So that's the key to tomorrow, getting off to a good start? 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I think so. You know, not putting too much pressure on myself to get off to a good start. But I would like to be right there, you know, 11, 12, 13 so coming in I'm right within reach.
