  Q. How big was that finish for you out there?   
 WEBB SIMPSON: It was huge. It was a struggle all day. Really didn't feel like I played that bad, just was a really tricky day for us in the last group with the wind.   
 So to finish birdie-birdie was huge heading into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How did you turn it around?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: I just kept telling my caddie, We got to stay patient. Can't get ahead of ourselves. If we just kind of hang around, we'll have a shot to win.   
 I know 10-under was leading pretty much all day. We knew it was getting away from us. Just had to stay patient and understand that I have a good shot tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Were you putting more pressure on yourself because you knew A.K. had gone lower today?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Not really. I knew that conditions were going to be nice for them this morning. It didn't really put pressure on me, but I also knew that they were making birdies and I probably needed to get a couple coming in just to hang around.
