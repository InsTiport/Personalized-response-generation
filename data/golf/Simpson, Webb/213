 Q.   Let's eliminate 9 from the conversation right now.   Looked like a pretty good round for you, all told.  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I putted well.   Made everything I looked at.   You know, I hit some good shots.   My ball striking was a little shaky at times.   Short game kind of let me hang in there and got to 6-under and, unfortunately, 9 happened but, you know, all in all a good start to this tournament and the scores are not too low.  
   
 Q.   What is the confidence level that you have here at this golf course where you obviously had very good success last year?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's great.   When you come to a place that you played well, you feel comfortable out here.   The tee shots all look good to me.   I love these greens.   So I felt like you know, the comfort level just makes me play better and allows me to be a little more aggressive.  
   
 Q.   Carryover from last year.   You played so well here.  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Little bit.   Anytime you play well at any kind of event I think your comfort level increases and you know all the tee shots and par-3s look good to me.   My putting was good.   It's nice to come play at a place like this.  
   
 Q.   There was a lot of conversation between you and Bubba throughout the round.   Now, does that help you to play better or is it because you're playing well and you're more apt to converse?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah.   I played rounds where we don't really talk at all, whoever we're playing with.   It doesn't affect the way I play.   It's certainly enjoyable when you play guys you know well and you can talk about stuff other than golf and joke around.   I enjoy it.   
Steve, you know, he's a great friend.   We played a lot together it seems like the past year or so.   A pairing I really like.
