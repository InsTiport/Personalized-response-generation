 Q.   With Tom Watson today in your round, knowing where you are currently in the Ryder Cup standings.   I know the TOUR has had some fun with pairings the last couple of years.   How much of him watching you was in your mind today?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Just a little bit, you know.   I think‑‑ the thing I believe in is if I take care of what I'm supposed to take care of, you know, add up all the points come a month from now, then I either deserve to be on the team or hopefully if I don't make it, close enough to where I'm tough not to pick.   
So I think a little bit about it.   I remember playing with Davis in Greensboro before the '12 Ryder Cup.   Kind of the same feelings, but they both know golf well enough to know that if I shoot 64 today, it's not like he's going to pick me if I don't make the team.   It's all about playing well and hopefully being in good form for the Ryder Cup.  
   
 Q.   Did you guys talk Ryder Cup at all during the round?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not much.   We talked a little bit about the course and what he's going to do about scouting it out.   I know some guys are going to play it I guess a few days before the British.   So we were just talking a little bit about it, but more about football and Carolina Panthers and Charlotte Bobcats.  
   
 Q.   I bet this place means a lot to you.   You represent it.   I know you want to play well tomorrow and make a run on the weekend.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I know.   I love playing here.   I've had some good chances to win here since the tournament started.   Today definitely did not play the way I wanted to.   But the game is there.   I just need a couple of rounds Friday Saturday, get back in it for Sunday.
