 Q.  Great day at the U.S. Open for you, Webb.  
WEBB SIMPSON: It was nice to finish off with 5-under.  Great group, played with two of my good buddies, they played great.  We kind of fed off of each other, me and Paul.  Made a lot of birdies, a lot of putts.  But the U.S. Open is still tough.  It's always nice to shoot a red number, and great to finish that way.   
 Q.  Take us through 6 through 9, that's some good playing.  
WEBB SIMPSON: I was 1-under through 5, but I had 6 and 7 in front of me.  You don't think much about 8, 9 and 10 as birdie holes.  But I did a good job this week I felt of staying patient.  There were times when I wanted to get frustrated.  You never know, if you're patient you might make birdies when I wasn't expecting to.  That's what I did on today on 9.  I hit a 5-iron in there 15 feet and made birdie.  So all in all I wanted a little more out of this week but like I said, there's some positives and a great way to build off this final round.   
 Q.  Out of the birdies you made today which one would you say was the best one?  
WEBB SIMPSON: Probably 17.  17 is probably the toughest.  Into the wind.  I was in between clubs, and I hit a shot in there about 15 feet, had a tough putt and made it.  That felt nice.   
 Q.  What club?  
WEBB SIMPSON: That was a 3-iron hybrid.   
 Q.  As you go through things today, you're playing for the best you can be and then you get into a zone where you're going pretty good, does it ever enter your mind that maybe I can do something really crazy here?  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you think that sometimes when you get off to a better start than I did.  I didn't get off to a great start.  But if you're 1-, 2-, 3-under through four or five, you've got six coming up you start thinking that way.  But today I didn't.  Stayed patient, and one shot at a time.  Made the eagle on 6 to start me in the right direction.   
 Q.  Could you walk us through 6 on the clubs you hit?  
WEBB SIMPSON: 6 was a 3-wood off the tee, and then I cut 5-wood into about 15 feet and made it.   
 Q.  What is it about today, I think you're the second minus five, what's in the golf course that's giving us the numbers we've seen?  
WEBB SIMPSON: All week we haven't seen the sun.  The greens are still firm, but they're as soft as it can be.  And it makes the scoring conditions easier.  But I think today in specific the wind is down a little bit compared to yesterday and just that little bit of wind down I think makes it easier and we're able to go get it.  The pins on the back were tough, I will say that.
