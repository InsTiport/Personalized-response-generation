 Q. I wanted to talk to you about Nathan, playing with him today. I put a thing in your locker yesterday about him, so you sort of knew his story. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yes, sir. 

 Q. Just some thoughts about that. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah. I read -- I got really sick the last couple days with the flu, still playing. 
 Obviously it was neat to read it before I went out and played today because it just kind of put my temporary situation into perspective, and it's an amazing story. Super nice young guy, and just amazing what God's done turning around his life, and he's one of the fastest guys his age around.

 Q. Yeah. Sort of what Children's Miracle Network is all about, right?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah. Exactly. Right. We had a blast out there together. 

 Q. Okay, great. Thanks. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Thank you.
