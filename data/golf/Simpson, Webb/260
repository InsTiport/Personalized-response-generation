  Q. Solid 65 in the first round. You were very democratic. You spread your birdies throughout the whole golf course.  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you know, it was kind of an up and down day. Made two bogeys. I started hitting the tee ball left a little bit, but made a nice couple putts for par there in the middle of the round.  
 Just kind of kept it together and made a nice putts on 7 and a nice birdie on 8 to finish it off.  
  
  Q. You played well here last year. What's the difference between last year and this year from a players' standpoint?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: You know, it's a little longer. But in terms of the way we're approaching the golf course, it's pretty similar. The greens are in great shape. The whole course is in great shape.  
 I think the scores will not quite be as low as last year, but you'll see some good numbers.  
 And depending on what the weather does this week end, I think you'll see -- I don't know if you'll see any 59s, but you'll see some low rounds.  
  
  Q. You shot a low one today. Keep it up throughout the week.  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Thanks.
