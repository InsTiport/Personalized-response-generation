Q. Three shots back as it stands rights now.
Tell me a little bit about your round and what your strength was today.
WEBB SIMPSON: I just kind of played good, solid golf.  For the most part I was hitting quality shots and hitting good putts.  So, you know all in all 3-under is a great day.  It was dry out there.
Q. Compared to yesterday morning to this afternoon, how about the difference in the wind and did it play that much easier for you?
WEBB SIMPSON: No, because it got a lot dryer a lot faster.  We had some tough pins that were hard to get at because of that so I think it played about the same as yesterday.
Q. What's going to be your approach going into tomorrow?
WEBB SIMPSON: I'm in good position.  I got to continue with good, consistent golf and after two days I'm in a good spot.
Q. Thanks so much for your time.
