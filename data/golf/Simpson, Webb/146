 Q.   Talk us through that one.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was tough.   Just thank the Lord forgiving me strength to get through today.   It was an early morning.   But I had a stallion was a partner.   Bill played some great golf and it was fun to watch.  
   
 Q.   Now you guys play such a similar game, I was looking back to the fairway and I couldn't tell you apart; how comfortable is this combination for you guys?   
BILL HAAS:   I think it was beyond the golf for sure.   Both of us being Wake Forest guys, we've got so much similar cares in the world, I guess you could say, and the golf just made it that much more special today.   
I laid the sod over a 3‑wood there on the last hole and fortunate to have an okay lie and get up‑and‑down.   I think certain days it goes your way and certain days it goes the other guy's way.   Awesome to win a match with my man, Webb.   
   
 Q.   How disjointed was it out there for you guys coming on and off the golf course all morning?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's awkward.   It's tough.   Today was already going to be a long day no matter what with two rounds.   I think it helps in team competition, you've got a teammate to feed off of and kind of hang in there with.   Fortunately we were able to come out and Bill hit some great shots the last couple of holes.  
   
 Q.   How were you able to dominate your match over Grace and Cabrera today?   
BILL HAAS:   I think we did a good job.   I don't think we birdied the same hole.   Maybe No. 5 we both birdied.   Other than that, I was on 10, I was out of the hole, and Webb, one of the toughest holes on the course, knocked a 6‑ or 7‑iron in there close and made the putt.   Ham‑and‑egged it I guess, the amateurs call it.   We did a good job of that today.
