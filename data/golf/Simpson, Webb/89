Q. On 9, 145.  Was that a one-hopper in?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I hit 9 iron, and when I first hit it, I thought I hit it too hard, but I could tell it was getting hit by the wind.  It was perfect.  It was a fun way to end the side.
Q. Looked like you and the caddie did a little pirouette there?
WEBB SIMPSON: I was happy.  I didn't know what to do, so I started jumping and doing circles.
Q. You've recently found good form.  What have you done that's allowed you to find that success?
WEBB SIMPSON: Well, I mean, last week, it was one of those weeks where everything kind of came together.  Ever since I got hurt in February, I haven't really hit it that well.  Last week I hit it great and putted really well.
This week has been kind of more of the same, just kind of steady and keeping the ball in play and making some putts when I need to.
Q. How does it change things when you know people are going to put up low scores and par is not good enough?
WEBB SIMPSON: You know, you just have to tell yourself on this golf course there's four par 5s.  They're usually all reachable.  You've just got to be patient.  I was only 1 under through seven holes, missed a couple of short opportunities for birdie, but I just hung in there, made a good putt at 8, eagled 9, and all of a sudden, I was kind of right back into it.
