 Q. Nice opening round for you. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was good. Kind of a whirlwind on the front nine. I had a hole-in-one and a ruling that went back in my favor. All in all, it's a good day.

 Q. Tell me about the ace. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: I actually got a new 3-iron hybrid yesterday. One of the Titleist guys fitted it for me perfectly. Just a good number. Looked good. Went in. We didn't know it went in until we went to the green. 

 Q. How awesome is that, looking all around, walk up to the cup, did it go in?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was a good feeling. I saw the ball mark couple feet short and I knew it was in.

 Q. Also a good feeling to shoot 5-under par 66. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah. You know, I left a couple out there coming in. Got a couple things to work on, hopefully get it going tomorrow.

 Q. Came into the fall series a little bit under the gun on the Money List. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, middle of the run here the last couple months. 
 I still got my goals I want to accomplish this year. It was a good start.
