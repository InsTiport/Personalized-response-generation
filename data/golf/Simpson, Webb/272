  Q. You had a lot of fun this week, great tournament.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, thanks. I had a blast. You know, every day I seemed to be playing pretty good, and today I was a little slower to start, and I made some nice birdies in the middle of the round. You know, unfortunately 17 I hit it left, only place you can't hit it. But all in all, I had a great week and learned a lot.  
  
  Q. You get to play a game for a living, and you don't take this too seriously. You look like you've got a great perspective. I know the anguish in your heart from not winning your first PGA TOUR event, but you walked off and you saw your dad, your wife, and you kind of got stabilized there when you walked off the green.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you know, she's my best friend, and she's right there with me every step of the way. It's great to have someone with you supporting you like that. We sat down at the beginning of the week and said that my goal for the week was to be in contention Sunday, and we did it. So goal was accomplished, just looks like I'm going to be a shot short.  
  
  Q. What do you take away from this week competitively?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: I take away a lot. I think I proved today to myself and everyone else that I can do it. I made a lot of good birdies and good swings and good putts there on the back nine, which is what I needed to do.   
 You know, I'll sit down and really analyze what I was thinking and feeling on 17 to learn from it, but all in all, I'm pleased.   
  
  Q. What did you say to your wife to get her to smile?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: I told her when I come back from the interview that she'd better quit crying.   
 I knew that today was going to be a little tougher. There was a little wind out there. But it looks like 21 did it.
