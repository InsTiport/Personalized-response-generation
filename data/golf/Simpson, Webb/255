   WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you know it's disappointing to get to 10-under at the turn. 10-under is going to win looks like, so it's disappointing. I'll learn from it and move on.

 Q. How much fun was it to be right in the middle of it? You got yourself in a hole and you dug yourself out with some great iron play. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: It was okay. Honestly, it wasn't that enjoyable of a round because I had so many mistakes. It was fun when I made the turn. I made a little comeback. 
 But after that it was kind of a struggle.

 Q. At 17 and 18 you gave yourself a chance. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, you know, I had a good shot in there at 18 and ended up just short of the hole. It's disappointing, but you move on. 

 Q. Still in the top 10 in FedExCup, and almost top 10 in Presidents Cup, too. That would be huge for you, wouldn't it? 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it would be great. (Indiscernible) see how the year unfolds.

 Q. Can you just summarize the week. 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I never really had my A game this week. I was kind of all over the map, but had it in there. 
 Struggling and finishing top 10, that's a good sign.
