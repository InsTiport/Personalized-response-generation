Q. Webb, now the United States can't lose the Cup because you just earned the 15th point here on the 17th green. How would you gauge the range of emotions as you make your way around Sunday singles?
WEBB SIMPSON: It's amazing. You don't go through any other emotions like this in any other tournament. This and The Ryder Cup for us is the biggest emotion swings that I've ever faced. But today I made up my mind on the way to the first tee that I wasn't going to look at anything. If it came down to it and I needed to know something, I would ask. It's a good feeling.
Q. We see it in match play, the guys give you hugs and handshakes. What's it like to share this with the other guys in a team sport atmosphere when it normally is an individual game?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I remember Jim Furyk here in 2011 told me that at the end of your career, "You're going to remember your wins, your majors and your team events." I took it to heart and realize the team events are where you make the best memories that you have.
Being with these guys this week, I was 0-3, but I had already built up enough memories that it was still a good week, but I did want to come out and finish strong today.
