 Q.  Give us some thoughts on the match today.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was up-and-down for both of us today.  I love playing with Pat.  He and I both made birdies, we made mistakes.  So it was kind of all about managing mistakes.  It played tough out there.   
 Q.  It was super windy.  Just comment about how much tougher it was.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yesterday I go out in the morning with no wind.  Today it felt a bit like a major because you are thinking so much about each shot.  Easy to overthink it, but at the same time there's a lot of things to consider.   
 Q.  Just your thoughts going into tomorrow's match.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, coming off a comeback halve yesterday and a victory today, I feel like I have got good momentum.  But he won today, so we'll see.  I'm looking forward to it.  I love competing, it's fun.  Try to go out and get another win.
