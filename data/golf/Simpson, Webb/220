 Q.   You just seem to be in convention every week now.   Another solid start to a golf tournament for you?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, it was good.   We hit it really nice on the back.   Hit a couple loose shots on the front just now but held it in there, made a couple nice saves.   Any time you come around this track bogey‑free, it's a good day.   
   
 Q.   Such a different course from Kapalua Plantation, is it a difficult adjustment at all?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   A little bit.   It's just a lot tighter so you have to think a little more off the tees.   But overall, you've still got to hit shots like you did last week and make putts.   
   
 Q.   I know you're probably a little bit tired physically and mentally at the end of last season, you also had a busy off‑season; are you reenergized out here?   If you're tired, it's not showing up in your play?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   We had three weeks at home and I really made it a priority to rest and I showed up at Kapalua really ready to go and had a lot of energy.   Walking those hills took a little energy out of me but I've gained it back.   My trainer is here and we are working out, so I feel good.  
   
 Q.   You played with Ryo Ishikawa, massive galleries, what's that like?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   He's a star and great guy, nice kid, tons of game and it's always fun playing with him.
