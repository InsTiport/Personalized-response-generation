  WEBB SIMPSON:   I didn't feel like I was doing a whole lot wrong.   I played really solid, kind of hung in there, couldn't really make anything, couldn't really get anything going.   But then got to 18 and made double.   Kind of a sour way to end.   But we've got two more rounds, and hopefully keep progressing.  
   
 Q.   And obviously playing with Ben, he's part of the history of this place?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Talk about that.   It's kind of cool to see him go out like this?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It is.   I played behind him the last two days, so it's cool to hear the people's support of him.   
But winning two Masters, this place is going to be really special to you.   It's sad to see him go, but I know it's the right time for him.   
   
 Q.   And tomorrow, what's your plan?   You really can't go for every pin, obviously?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Right.   Just continue to build, hopefully a couple under par rounds and move up, and I'll be happy.
