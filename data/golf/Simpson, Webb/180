WEBB SIMPSON
  69-65 Total 134. (-8)

JULIUS MASON:   Webb Simpson with quite a day today, 65.   I think you have to be pleased with that.   Did you just kind of run out of holes to catch PÃ¡draig? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's hard to say.   He's playing well and he made the putts you've got to make. 
I think the turning point for us was kind of the 10 through 13 stretch.   I had some good looks and played them even, and he played them 3‑under.   He played great.   Made a big putt on 16. 
But I'm really encouraged with how I played today.   Wish I could have probably had that shot back on 18, the iron shot.   I just came out of it.   But overall, good day, and you know, it's been a great week. 
JULIUS MASON:   Can you talk about weather conditions today versus yesterday? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I can't believe the weather.   I didn't bring an umbrella and I guess I knew what I was doing. 
Today, it just blew a little less and in a little different direction.   I think today played a little easier but pins were a little tougher today so maybe it evened out. 

Q.   We heard you remark on the closed‑circuit feed on 11 and 12, both putts, a foot from the hole looked like they were in and both missed.   Talk about both of those. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   The greens were really good, really true.   They were just, you know, I usually have about one putt like that every three tournaments.   I had two putts I hit in a row that were a foot out; the ball is in the middle and you think it's going to stay straight.   Kind of gut‑wrenching those two holes, to have those looks and thinking I'm making birdie. 
But I didn't second‑guess my reads and we kept doing what we were doing.   Only bad putt I hit all day was 15.   I didn't get set over it and pulled it.   Overall, putted pretty well today. 

Q.   The shot at 18, what did you have left in and what did you hit?
WEBB SIMPSON:   18, we had 162.   We thought it played about 170.   I hit a 7‑iron and just kind of came out of it. 
My weakness this year has been when I'm in between clubs and I try to smooth one, my body kind of shuts down, doesn't work as well and that's what happened. 
So it's just an eye‑opener that I've got a lot of work to do in the off‑season, because you're going to have four or five shots a round where I'm in‑between clubs.   So I learned from it.   I wish I could have putt a little more pressure on PÃ¡draig, but he'd probably have 2‑putted if he had to.
