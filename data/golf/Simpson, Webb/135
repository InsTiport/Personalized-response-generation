 Q.   You gave one back today but you gotta feel good about where you sit IN relation to how the tournament is shaping up?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I started out struggling a little bit and I thought I held it together and got a few birdies there on the front.   
Not exactly what I wanted today, but I didn't chew myself out at all.   The course is still tough.   I think the scores will be better this afternoon, so right there in it, I think, still.   
   
 Q.   On Saturday if you're going low, you're moving up.   What's‑‑ what do you feel the number might be for you tomorrow to get toward the top?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think the weather is going to be great the next couple of days, so I think score conditions will be perfect for us.   
I definitely think something in the 60s will keep me in it and give me a chance Sunday.   
   
 Q.   What was missing from your round today?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was driving there in the first part of the round.   Then I hit a couple of chips that weren't normally what I do.   It was just one of those things, nothing really stuck out.   I had three lip‑outs today, all three of those putts I thought I made.   So yesterday was a different story in the sense that all the putts went in.   
But I had a nice, solid last few holes to round out the day and all in all kind of hung in there; that's how I view today.   
   
 Q.   Are there days or weeks that you kinda need one of those to realize what you might want to improve on the next day?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   Exactly.   Today could have gone a 75 or 76 if I wasn't careful.   So I really wanted to make that putt in the last hole to get it back to even.   I think even would have been exceptional with the game I had today, but we're going to practice this afternoon and figure something out for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Do you think double digits will do it?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think so.   With the weather we're going to have, I don't think too far in the double digits, but I think somebody can get there.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Webb.
