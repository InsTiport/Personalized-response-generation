Q.   [No microphone.]
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I played great all day.   Good solid round all around.   The only thing I can think about now is thankful to be done, get a week off before Presidents Cup. 
It's always nice to finish the year with a good round like that.

Q.   What are you looking forward to about Presidents Cup? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, I've only played on two teams.   It's so fun to be around the guys.   Everybody is so competitive, wants to win so bad. 
So it's just fun to be in that kind of atmosphere with that kind of energy.   I'm excited to get there, obviously love Muirfield.   I'm interested to see what the golf course is like.

Q.   This particular group of guys, what's the makeup of this team?   Kind of what can you tell us about the personalities maybe, if you will, that are on this squad? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's a lot of the same guys that have been on the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup team that I was on.   We all know each other very well. 
Jordan's the young guy who maybe guys don't know him well, but I played with him this week.   Great kid and excited to see him playing that format.   I know everybody wants to be his partner.

Q.   Just talk about that a little bit.   We're hearing quite a bit of the guys that have come through, whether it's you want to be his partner because he's playing well or some of the more experienced guys want to help him out.   Everybody is kind of gravitating toward him. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   You always want to gravitate, in my opinion, towards a young guy playing with a lot of confidence.   There is just not much fear there. 
The rounds he's played lately, he's put up quite a number of birdies.   It's pretty easy to say why we'd all want to play with him.
