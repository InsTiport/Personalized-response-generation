 Q. Obviously a great round, great position heading into the weekend. A couple of comments about the round and how you're feeling?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, played solid. Kind of similar day as yesterday. I really only threw away one shot and that was on 4. I 3-putted from eight feet, just kind of careless. But other than that, solid and looking forward to the weekend.

 Q. What's going right? What's clicking for you?
 WEBB SIMPSON: I think what Paul and I were talking about walking off 18, we just are limiting our mistakes. I'm missing the right shots and taking advantage of the easy holes and kind of cruising along.

 Q. This is revered as a ball-striker's course and you have to pretty much have everything on. Do you feel like you fit right into that category this week?
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I won a junior tournament here when I was 15, so I've always felt good on the golf course. But it's like a longer, harder Hilton Head and I love that golf course; tree-lined fairways. I feel great out there.
