Q.   Basically when I would play well, I'd say, I'm staying out of my own way.   Is that true for you, too?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, it is.   I hit a couple loose shots today but just really managed to make putts and take advantage of the holes that you've got to make birdie on.   The course is set up good again, some tough pins, and we stayed away from the trouble.   But thankful to shoot another good one.

Q.   When you play a hard course you always say one shot at a time, one shot at a time, but I think when you've got an easy course isn't it even more a factor because you can't get ahead of yourself when you want to go low because if you start thinking about it, good luck?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Absolutely.   I mean, you've still got to place the ball in certain spots to be able to make birdies.   Even on the short holes you've got to make sure you get on the correct side of the hole, and then if you're doing that you can be more aggressive.

Q.   Tell me about 7, because that is a short hole and I was surprised where you ended up.   What was your plan there?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Well, we just hit driver trying to take care of that left bunker.   It's a tough pin to hit a wedge shot close, or a full wedge shot, so we were just trying to get it as close as possible.   There's going to be a lot of bogeys, I think, there today.   I was happy to get out of there with par. 

Q.   8‑under 63 today, obviously a lot of birdies out there. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   There were.   We got off to a nice start birdieing the first hole, but the ball is really going far.   I was wondering why the scores were so low yesterday morning because I thought the ball might go a little shorter.   But the ball was getting out there and the golf course played a little shorter than I thought it would, and just putted well and just kind of kept going.

Q.   Finished up with a birdie on 9.   Talk to me about that putt. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was actually a tough read.   I had a different read from the other side of the hole than I did from behind the ball, but we both kind of agreed it was right center.   That was a good one to get.   I didn't hit a good drive on 9 and had to lay it up, so it was good to get a 4 there.

Q.   Last time you played here, top 5, 64‑63 to start, what kind of number do you think you're looking at?   What do you think it's going to take to win?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think low to mid 20s again.   I mean, it seems like the PGA TOUR had a famous year of what we're doing these first two days and then it slows down a little bit.   I think the weather is going to be good.   I think guys are going to keep making birdies, so I've got to keep the hammer down. 

Q.   Is this the last event of the year for you?
WEBB SIMPSON:   No, Tiger's tournament.

Q.   The last TOUR event?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Sea Island.

Q.   Just these two?
WEBB SIMPSON:   As far as I know, yeah. 

Q.   What brought you back out here?
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, I was kind of tired of weather delays, so I knew that Vegas would be a pretty good spot.   You know, it's just a lot of little things, direct flight from Charlotte.   I do like the golf course.   I like these greens.   I grew up on greens similar to these.   And it's a golf course, it's not really a high‑stress week.   Still, I mean, certainly has its challenges, but on the mind it's a little easier than a really tough golf course. 

Q.   Can I ask you about concentration on a course like this?   Do you find yourself lapsing, going off?   Do you have to fight it sometimes? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, you do.   I mean, there's no wind, no clouds in the sky, and it's really quiet, so it's easy to kind of daydream.   So you've really got to focus on what you're doing and talk to your caddie, at least for me, talk to him about what we're trying to do here, where we're trying to hit the ball.

Q.   Do you have one daydream that keeps haunting you?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not really.   I think about my family all day long because they're back home, but that's a good thing. 

Q.   Compare the challenge of playing a U.S. Open type course and then playing here where you've still got to constantly make birdies to keep up.   What are those two challenges? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Well, I think the one synonymous thing is patience because U.S. Open you obviously have to remain patient because you're not going to make many birdies, but here it's not like every hole is a birdie hole so you have to remain patient because I think birdie runs come.   A lot of guys this week you'll see making two, three, four in a row, and the reason you have to stay patient is you'll get on those runs, too.

Q.   Can you sense the vibe differently out here now that there's FedExCup points and there's more excitement on the grounds?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think so.   We're thankful that the sponsors have stayed with us and increased the purses of all these tournaments and we're playing for $5?, $6 million.   It used to be $4 million.   I think everybody is excited to play for more money, play for FedExCup points, and the fields are getting better. 

Q.   And for you to get off to a good start here, because you're not going to play a couple events‑‑ a couple more and then some time off?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I mean, it's‑‑

Q.   It'll be good to get a foundation?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, you don't want to sit for a couple months way behind because then you might come out starting the year pressing and trying to jump people.   I just wanted to get a nice solid start.

Q.   How would you describe your 2013 season?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Solid.   You know, I haven't won this year yet, but my one goal every year is to get better, and I felt like I got better.   I was happy to finish the TOUR Championship with a good, solid tournament.   Getting better, so that's all I care about.

Q.   Any specific areas or a little bit of everything?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Just a little bit of everything.   I think I've driven it better this year, especially the second half of the year, which has enabled me to play a lot better.
