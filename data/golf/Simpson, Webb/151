Q.   Nice round.   Does it give you any extra for next week, kind of a jump start, so to speak?
WEBB SIMPSON:   It does.   You know, I felt like the game was there this week.   I couldn't really put a round together and I thought I played great yesterday, just didn't score well and today to come out and make six birdies and an eagle and one bogey was a great feeling.   Just where I want to be for next week.

Q.   How do you think the course held up with the rain yesterday and, you know, last night?
WEBB SIMPSON:   It did well.   I mean the guys did a good job of setting it up, pins in the right spots.   The greens held up unbelievable all week.   You really couldn't tell that the greens got any rain.   They were still as fast today as I've ever seen them.   So, they did a good job and I'm just hopeful and glad we're going to get it done.

Q.   How have you played lately?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think I played well last four, five events.   One bad round gets me.   Thursday I played well, I just scored pretty bad from where I was hitting my ball.   If I could have my round back I'd love it because I think I could have had a chance in the tournament.

Q.   Whole bunch of young guys coming up that still might grab this thing.   What's your advice to them if they do happen to grab it?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Well, I think, you know, the guy who wins is going to keep making birdies because there's some birdie holes on the back and the tees are up on a lot of holes.   You got to fire down and hopefully the numbers keep going lower.
