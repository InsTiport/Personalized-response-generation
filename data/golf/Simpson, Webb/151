 Q.   Did it feel weird out there, different than a tournament?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   A little bit.   Starting out the round I wasn't thinking much about it, but I knew that we were so close and I knew that every shot counted.   It was hard not to think about it.   But, you know, with all the delays we've had, my mind's just kind of gone.   
But he played great.   On the back nine, we had a bunch of putts.   He's a great competitor.  
   
 Q.   What are your emotions now?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It's the greatest honor I think we can all have.   I'd love to make the team.   I'd love to be a pick.   I thought about it the last two years, ever since we won in Australia.   I'm trusting in the Lord and know that it's going to be a good offâ€‘season, no matter what.   
   
 Q.   What do you anticipate the next 36 hours to be like?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, I'm going to go home.   Hopefully shut the house down.   Freddie is going to make two good picks.   And all the guys, myself and three or four are playing good golf.   He's got a tough job.   And we'll see what he does.
