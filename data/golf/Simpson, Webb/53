 Q.  I guess I don't know what to say about the flip in the match, but maybe you can describe  it.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, we got off to a great start, 2-up early.  And we just made a few mistakes.  But all in all, we didn't play that bad.  They had some great shots, made some big putts.  I thought we were going to get a couple that we didn't get.   
The 13th hole was kind of the flipped hole.  We thought we were going to get one there.  I was on the green.  But I love playing with Bubba.  He's great to be out with.  We hit good putts all day, we just really didn't make anything.  We'll get them tomorrow.   
 Q.  Any thoughts about the U.S. having such a great morning and then you have to deal with the afternoon like this?  
WEBB SIMPSON: It's the way it goes.  We have two more days, so we're going to regroup and just see what we're going to put out there in the morning and hopefully come out strong tomorrow.   
 Q.  At least you got your feet wet on the golf course.  
WEBB SIMPSON: Yep, that's right.
