  WEBB SIMPSON:   The bogey on 3 and to bogey 4 from the middle of the fairway, those were kind of killers there to start the round.   Again, I shot 1â€‘under on the back.   Played great on the back side, did what I needed to do on the back, but just a tough way to start.   
When you get a guy like Zach Johnson in contention, he's really tough.   He doesn't make mistakes.   I knew with him close it was going to take a good round.   What I shot was about what I thought would take it.  
   
 Q.   Hard to call him underrated, isn't it?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, he's one of our best competitors.   You can learn a lot from watching him play.   But I was thinking a lot about Paul and Michelle and Isaiah.   I felt like I did a good job of kind of focusing on what I needed to.   I wanted it really bad for him.   But I was happy with the way I kind of finished things.
