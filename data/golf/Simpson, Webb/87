Q. 66 yesterday, 65 this morning, two good days work?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was good.  I feel like I kind of scraped it a little bit yesterday but today was a little more solid.  You know, got off to a rough start today bogeying the first.  Kind of made a mess of it.  But after that it was pretty clean and made a great save on 17 and finished up with a birdie on 18, so I'm happy.
Q. The fall was solid, if not spectacular.  Anything special change over the break to bring out this good form early in the season?
WEBB SIMPSON: I don't think so.  I've been working hard on it.  Been playing a lot of golf the last few weeks.  But no, I'm comfortable here.  I love playing this golf course.  I've come every year except once since 2009.  I love Waialae, I really do.
Q. Nice to be here with the family?
WEBB SIMPSON: It is.  We took all four of our kids here.  Survived the flight.  The oldest three did pretty good.  Mercy, our eight-month-old, she was the tough one, but she did pretty good, too.
