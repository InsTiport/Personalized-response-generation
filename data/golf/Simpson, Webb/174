 Q.   What a beautiful birdie to end things.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   Thanks.   I've just got to thank my Lord because I've been sick all week, my family has been sick and I haven't gotten much rest, and just prayed for strength today and somehow made it through.  
   
 Q.   I know your putting has been good, your ball‑striking at times has been a little bit wayward, but you're making putts when they count.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I did, and Peter is such a great player.   We went back and forth, it was almost like a boxing match, exchanging punches.   But I had a feeling coming down the last couple holes, and we were able to hit some good shots coming in.   
   
 Q.   A tough match for you today.   Only time you were ahead was the final hole.   Tell us about that putt.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was a good putt.   I had a good read on it, and these greens are so pure it was rolling nice.   It was a good match.   Peter is such a great player, and we went back and forth all day, and I feel fortunate to come out on top.  
   
 Q.   How much do you enjoy this format?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I like it.   You know, it's harder on the mind.   It tests your patience a lot more than stroke play, but it's fun.   You've got one opponent, and we only get to do it once or twice a year, so it's fun to get in that frame of mind.   Your strategy can change in the middle of any hole.   I think everybody enjoys it, and you never know what can happen in match play.  
   
 Q.   Gonzalo Fernandez‑Castano tomorrow; have you ever played with him, met him?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I've met him.   Seems like a nice guy.   I've never played with him, so we'll see.
