Q. Kind of an even day out there.  Start with a bogey; come back with birdie at 6.  Talk a little bit about the round.
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I didn't play that bad.  I hit so many good putts that didn't go in.
You know, it's just one of those days that's frustrating.  Frustrating to end the way I did.  You know, I gave myself a chance, and that's what got to try to do every week.
I've got to take away the good stuff from here and move on.
Q. You came into 18 knowing you needed a shot.  Did that affect your approach there?
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I knew -- I wasn't trying to hit it right at it.  I was trying to go a little right of it, but it came off a little left.  I actually thought it was perfect.  Paul and I both thought it was long, but it came up just short and hit a really good bunker shot and missed it.
Q. What do you take from this tournament moving ahead?
WEBB SIMPSON: Game is in good shape.  I need to tighten up a couple things with ball striking, but overall I'm pleased.
