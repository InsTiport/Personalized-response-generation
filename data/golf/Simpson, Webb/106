 Q.  3-under par solid round out there.  Conditions are always challenging, but as the afternoon moves on are you seeing this course firm up, especially the second half of your round?  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I think so.  It was a little soft to start, the wind didn't blow until probably 7 or 8.  But it blew hard the last 10 holes. So, yeah, it will firm up a little bit.  But they have such good moisture in the fairways and even on the greens still.  I think it will take a day or two before you really see a big difference.   Q.  You've been flying under the radar this season.  Three top-10s, pretty consistent play.  Where is your game at and how is it going to really apply to success here on this course?  WEBB SIMPSON: I feel good with my game.  I feel like I'm -- using a Twitter word -- I'm trending in the right direction.  That's all I want. We got three majors left, some big golf tournaments to play, that's where I want to be, I always want to be hanging around and so I feel like I'm in a good spot and got to keep improving.   Q.  The lead is 4-under par, so you are just one off of that.  Do you see that score getting much lower this afternoon; and you have to be happy with your position.  WEBB SIMPSON: I think one or two guys could do it, but, no, if this wind stays up, it will be pretty tough this afternoon.  So I think we'll be in a good spot going into tomorrow.
