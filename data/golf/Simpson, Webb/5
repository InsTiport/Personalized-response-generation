Q. 67.  Nice round.  If we can get some comments.
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, it was a good day.  I had it going, 8-under through 12, two poor drives there in the middle of the round, but made some good swings coming in.  So definitely played better today, putted better, feel encouraged.
Q. I had one media member wanted me to ask:  Have you ever lost balls on consecutive holes like that before?
WEBB SIMPSON:   No, I don't remember a time.  Thankfully I hit a good drive on 14 on the second one to save bogey.  But, no, I've never done that before.
Q. Just moved on from it, though.
WEBB SIMPSON:   Moved on, yeah.  Made a good swing on 15 and good shots coming in.
Q. How are you feeling?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I'm feeling good.  Yeah, I feel -- surprisingly, I've handled these hills better than I thought I would.
Q. Is your taste back?
WEBB SIMPSON:   No.
Q. Nothing?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I miss the taste, yeah.  Nothing is back.
