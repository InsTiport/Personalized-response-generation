Q.   Does this give you some momentum going into next week?
    WEBB SIMPSON:   It's what I've been looking for for a few months now it seems like.   I came in this week feeling good after three weeks off.   Put together a good weekend and finally get some birdies there on Sunday.

Q.   Did the course, you feel that it will be a good kind of a prep for what's coming next week?
    WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah.   I mean I think weather wise we're going to have similar weather, hot.   Golf balls will go a long way.   I wanted to be here to get ready for next week for a lot of reasons.   It's always nice going to go a Major where you feel like you're in a good rhythm.

Q.   What's it like knowing that what you guys did this past week played such a big role in St. Jude's?
    WEBB SIMPSON:   It's great.   I got emotional for me on 18 because I saw this kid, I don't know what he's been through, I'm sitting there worrying about my golf game and just what he's been through is, you know, the worse and, so, it's always nice to be able to do something for other people, especially children who are suffering. 
    I love the sponsorship here.   I love all that's going on around this tournament for the children.   It's always nice to put this stupid game we play in perspective.

Q.   You guys did a really nice job in navigating your way through a weather situation with the scheduling, it had to be tough.
    WEBB SIMPSON:   It was.   I'm thankful we were able to finish and, you know, didn't look like we were going to finish for most of the day but by the time we putted on 18 I realized we're done and it felt weird because I was already thinking about my next round.   Kind of get in a fog when you play this much golf in a row. 
    Really thankful to be done.
