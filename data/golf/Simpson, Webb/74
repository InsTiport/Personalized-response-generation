 Q.  Webb, you came up with some good shots.  You must be proud of that valeant finish.  
WEBB SIMPSON: It was a good finish.  I struggled out of the rough all week.  That is what ended up costing me the golf course.  Every time I hit it in the rough I struggled to get it on the green or near the hole.  That's the big thing I have to work on, but you have to be -- yeah, to be 1-over through 12 holes, it's nice to make four birdies coming in.   
 Q.  You're taking some good momentum into the Playoffs.  
WEBB SIMPSON: That's always nice to go into the first playoff event knowing your game is in good shape and you know as we move on into these Playoffs the events become more important.  Hopefully, I can keep it up.
