Q. Pin placement today, a big challenge?WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was tough.  I knew it was going to be set up tough with the scores the first few days.  They pretty much tipped us out on every hole except for one or two, maybe.  It was really difficult, much, much more difficult than the first two days.
Q. What were your aiming points?  Were you able to shoot at many flags?WEBB SIMPSON: Not many.  It seemed like there were three or four we went at.  You get out there and you really just try to survive. I played really well today, I just didn't get as much out of my round as I wanted to.  I had three or four balls a foot into the native area, had a terrible lie.  It could have gone a lot lower, I guess, I should say.
Q. Playing in bigger galleries, but playing with Phil that's pretty well taken care of?WEBB SIMPSON: Playing with Phil is fun.  We were talking earlier in the round, we wanted to get something going and kind of feed off of each other.  Neither one of us really got it going.  But that's what this course does for you.  You don't have many opportunities to make birdies.  We just didn't hit the ball close enough to have chances to get it going.
Q. Do you expect a more difficult set up or how did it fall in line with your expectations?WEBB SIMPSON: It's about what I expected.  I knew it was going to be drastically different.  So nothing really surprised me today.
Q. With both of you guys' popularity, did you feel it could be a wild atmosphere if you got it going?WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I felt if we both got our total score back to under par, it could be great. Martin is obviously confident right now.  We knew he'd have to play a really bad round for us to get back into contention.  I don't know what he's doing right now.  Shooting 3-over certainly didn't help my cause.
Q. (Inaudible.)WEBB SIMPSON: You're talking about Brendon Todd?  He's playing great.  He's played great now for a couple of months.  Being in his first Major, it's impressive to see how well he's playing.
Q. Playing in your home state of North Carolina, a lot of Wake Forest alums, does that give you any encouragement on the course?WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it's fun.  It's always great to play close to home.  Never played a PGA TOUR event here in Pinehurst.  But it's been great all week.  A lot of southern drawls out there.  I've had fun hearing everybody talking.
Q. (Inaudible) say anything to you?WEBB SIMPSON: No, I haven't talked to him much.  I usually hear from him after the tournament.
Q. What are you trying to get in the right direction now?WEBB SIMPSON: I just want to get back hitting it more consistent.  Consistency builds confidence, and that's what I've been lacking the last couple of months is confidence. And last week was great in that regard in that everything we worked on, I was able to produce during tournament conditions. I've taken that into this week.  I'm playing well.  I feel like I couldn't be any worse than 33rd or whatever place I'm in.  So I feel good leading into a summer full of tournaments, so I'm excited.
