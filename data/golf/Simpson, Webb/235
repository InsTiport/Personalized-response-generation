  Q. Fine performance out there today.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was a good day. Really windy out there and had quite a few mud balls, but we held it together. Any time we play bogey-free, it's a good thing.  
  
  Q. You and Luke are No. 1 and two on the Money List. What was it like playing out there with him and did you feel any more pressure?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: No, you know, he's played great all year, and we've played a lot together towards the end of the year. So I was comfortable and I'm sure he was as well. We fed off each other and played a good round.  
  
  Q. What are your thoughts for the rest of the tournament?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: It's a good start. That's all you can ask for on day one. Looking forward to trying to improve tomorrow. Just keep trying to climb the leaderboard.   
  
  Q. A little bit of wind today.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was windy. Had a few mud balls. Other than that, pretty solid. Didn't make any bogeys, which is always a good feeling. About all you can ask for on a day one.  
  
  Q. How did the course play today?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: It played well. Greens got quick and they were smooth and rolling nice. Course is in really great shape. This is my third year playing this tournament, and I don't remember it being in better shape than it is this year.  
  
  Q. Were you feeling any pressure about the Money List thing, especially playing with Luke head to head?   
 WEBB SIMPSON: No. I mean, there is so much that can happen at a golf tournament, especially in four days. So much can change.  
 So we're both, I'm sure, just focused on what we're doing and trying to play as good as we can play and have a chance to win on Sunday.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible: wind.)  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Not really. We joked around earlier on about it. It's all good. I think we're both I think handling to the right way and trying to go about our business and see how well we can do.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible: wind.)   
 WEBB SIMPSON: He shook my hand and told me it was great to see me. We went back and forth a little bit starting out, but overall it's been all good.  
  
  Q. I know you mentioned yesterday that you were going to try not to pay attention to what Luke was doing. But when he's playing as well as he is, is that tough to do?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Not really. I mean, I think when a guy is No. 1 in the world you expect him to play well. It almost makes it easier not to get caught up in what he's doing, because you expect him to go out and make a lot of birdies and be right there Sunday.  
  
  Q. How tough was that bunker shot on No. 1?  
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was unfortunate that it ended up that way. I just figured if I could get it out of the bunker it would be a pretty good shot.
