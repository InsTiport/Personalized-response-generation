Q.   Just real quick, a couple comments. 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I played great for the most part.   I just kind of played super sloppy coming in.   I made a couple birdies, but I just played sloppy.   So for me I'm going to really dwell on my first nine holes and just try to keep playing well.   Can't make those mistakes out here.
