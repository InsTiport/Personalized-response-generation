 Q.   Opposite ends of the spectrum:   We spoke to Scott Stallings who was 7‑over and he's awfully happy about the decision.   What do you think about it?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   It stinks for me.   I got off to a great start but that's the way it goes.   I'm sure they made the decision that's best for all the guys.  
But the good news is, had a good start and playing well.  
   
 Q.   Amazing with the numbers on the board that you were 3‑under par; how were you able to get to that score in these conditions?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Honestly we timed a couple of the rains at the right time.   5, the par5, at one point I was going to lay up and then the rain stopped and I hit through it on the green.   
So a couple fortunate breaks in that regard.   But you know, we are just trying to keep the ball in play and in front of us and I was able to make a couple of putts and that's what you have to do on a day like today.
