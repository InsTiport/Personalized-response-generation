 Q.  The double bogey at 9 did not derail you.  You didn't let it get you down, did you?  WEBB SIMPSON: No, I was super, super frustrated, though.  I just birdied 7 and 8, huge momentum.  And I just hit a terrible tee shot.  And that's one of the wider fairways we have. So that was certainly a momentum killer.  But I hung in there.  I was proud of the way I finished on the back nine.   Q.  The tee shot at the par 3, 16th, that was pretty sporty?  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, we were hoping it was going in.  I hit a few shots this week that looked like they were going to go in.  It was great to birdie one of the last few holes.  Hoping to get another one more at 18, but just tough tee shot.   Q.  What do you have to do tomorrow, what's the goal, 65, 64?  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, certainly similar to 2011.  I've got to go out and shoot a low number.  Guys around me are all playing good golf.  They could do the same thing.  So it's got to be a low one.
