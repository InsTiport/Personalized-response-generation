 Q.  Very solid week.  WEBB SIMPSON: I think so.  Obviously today I was very frustrated with the way I finished.  But I feel like my game is there.  I've still got I guess to tidy up a few things around the edges, but we'll see what happens.   Q.  When was the last time you talked to Tom?  WEBB SIMPSON: About three or four weeks ago, through a text message.   Q.  What was the conversation?  WEBB SIMPSON: I just told him I'm going to try to play hard the next few weeks and make it easy for him.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  WEBB SIMPSON: I don't know, we'll see.  He's obviously got guys playing well that were around me.  Honestly I don't know at this point, I haven't thought much about it.   Q.  Do you expect to hear from him tonight or tomorrow?  WEBB SIMPSON: I think so, yeah.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  WEBB SIMPSON: I don't know.   Q.  You've been through this before.  What do you do while you're waiting?  WEBB SIMPSON: Nothing.  We've got a long flight to Denver so I'm sure I'll replay today's round a few times.  Chris is playing well.  So I obviously had to shoot a low number to catch him.  We'll see.   Q.  How closely did you watch other guys that were in this conversation?  WEBB SIMPSON: I didn't watch any today.  I was trying to worry about my own self.  It was tricky out there.  I didn't really pay attention.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it would mean the world.  I mean I want to make that team and represent our country.  I want to join the guys, the guys that are up there on the team playing well.  I'll do anything to be on that team.
