 Q.   Do you feel like you left a lot of putts out there?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not really.   It would have been nice to get a few more, but I played really good.   I was on my lines, and they're just not falling right now.   But I made a few, more than I've been making, so hopefully tomorrow I'll be good to go.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you had a number in mind coming into the day to kind of jump up the leaderboard?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not really.   I knew those guys are playing so well it's going to be a tough task, but I just wanted to come out and play a good solid day of golf and draw on some confidence for next week.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about your experience here last year?   Can you use that experience in your final round tomorrow?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I think so, just last year I was pacing, I didn't try to press.   That's what I've got to do tomorrow.   Whether the winner shoots 23‑ or 24‑under or 16‑, I've got to go out and do the same thing.   
   
 Q.   Are the scores kind of typical of this course, as well?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think today.   It's all weather related.   I was surprised to see the scores so low the first two days with the wind that we had, but the scores will be low today.   The greens are soft.   Everything is playing pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Is it pretty steady out there wind‑wise today?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, not much wind.
