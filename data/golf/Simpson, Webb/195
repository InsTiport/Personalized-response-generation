Q.   Webb, you want to talk about the delay?   You kind of got off to kind of a good start.   What's this mean going into tomorrow?
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, it obviously, you know, makes it into a waiting game.   I had some momentum going and, you know, the unfortunate thing happened on 9 and bogeyed 10 but, you know, maybe the rate I was going maybe it will help to take a break and see what we can do tomorrow morning.

Q.   On No. 9, the ball moved.   Happened to you before.   What's your thoughts on that?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I mean, you know, it's one of those things where they claim that the rule was changed but it really wasn't.   I mean the only thing they put in there was that the wind, if the wind caused it to move you can move it back. 
Nine out of ten times when a ball moves on the green, in my opinion, I think most people agree with me, it's a heel print or spike mark.   It's rarely the wind. 
If it is blowing 30 miles an hour might not have been wind.   It's unfortunate.   All of us players think it's a bad rule.   I think the Rules Staff would agree. 
I have a hard time understanding why it's still in play.   So, you know, it is a rule.   I'm not going to blame my momentum on the rule but it stinks that it happened that way.

Q.   Now, all the fans that came out yesterday was a huge day out here and kind of puts a damper on things.   Thoughts on that, kind of coming from this area and what means for the fans.
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, there's such a good turnout all week.   I was surprised today seeing how many people came out given the weather.   It was nice to see a bunch of people still here and supporting Wyndham and hopefully we'll get a good crowd back out tomorrow.
