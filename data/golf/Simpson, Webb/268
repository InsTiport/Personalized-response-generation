  WEBB SIMPSON: You know, 16, 17, 18 are tough holes and I was really pleased to get a couple birdies out of them. 

 Q. And you saw some good scores before you teed off, how did that make you feel? 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, it was a good thing because I knew the wind was not going to be up too much today. Although I was one back, I needed to go out there thinking I was six back. 
 So it was good seeing scores and I think it helped me to kind of get off to an aggressive, good start.

 Q. You have a veteran caddie on your bag; how much has he helped you?
 WEBB SIMPSON: He's helped me a ton. He's the best. You know, we have come up with a great game plan for this year.
 And you know, we get to a tournament and come up with a game plan for the golf course and that's something he's helped me a ton with is course management and he's helped me out with these tough courses. I think we are a good team.

 Q. One back heading into the final round, don't want to get ahead of yourself, but are you starting to think about tomorrow? 
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, this course is tough enough to where you've got to think about the hole you're on. This is what we dream about and this is what practice for to have a chance on Sunday.
 So I'm looking forward to the challenge and opportunity. 

 Q. Your family is here this week, your son. Four and a half weeks old, what does to mean to have your family here with you?
 WEBB SIMPSON: The first few weeks were tough, across the country, but having her here has just been special. They are going to come next week. I'm going to pull for them to come every week.

 Q. How has it been going with the sleep factor?
 WEBB SIMPSON: It's been great. We had a good schedule at home that we would use. But this week, me having to play, she's letting me sleep all the way through the night. I feel great.
