 Q.   One back of the lead at the time, what were you telling yourself then?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   You know, just keep playing golf, because I knew that the last few holes were birdie holes.   I knew Stricker was going to finish well, and personally, I was more back than I wanted to be but had a solid day and see if I can get that low round to come off tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What is the game plan for tomorrow?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   We are just going to go out and stay patient again.   I'm sure the wind will be the same.   Wind conditions will be similar, so I'm going to go out and see if I can get off to a nice start and whatever happens.   
   
 Q.   Good players talk about patience, and you just said you have to stay patient but you want to get off to a hot start.   Is this a really difficult course to try to stay patient on?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think so.   I think it will be more difficult for me tomorrow, four back, is that what it is?   So I'm sure that will be difficult but I have to remember that tomorrow I have to go out and hit it one shot at a time and play the best that I can.   
   
 Q.   Riding that momentum from the end of the year, having a great time at the start of this year?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yes, it's been good.   I love this tournament already, my first time here and I don't want to leave and at least we get one more week to play next week.   
   
 Q.   Did you do something fun in the offâ€‘season?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   I just put the clubs in the closet and didn't work out for about two weeks, which was nice after going at it all year.   We didn't do anything or go anywhere but definitely rested a lot.
