Q. (In progress.)
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, today was a struggle.  Just wasn't quite sharp off the tee.  This golf course, I been hitting the fairway and this golf course is tough when you're not hitting the fairway.
But it was nice to finish with a few birdies coming in.  Happy for Rory.  He played fantastic.
Q. What are your biggest takeaways?
WEBB SIMPSON: I felt like mentally it was my best week in a long time.  I putted really well.  I'm excited.  Got to make short putts, long putts at the U.S. Open to contend, and so I'm excited for next week.  I think my game is in a good spot.  (Indiscernible - crowd.)
Q. (Indiscernible - crowd.)
WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I think there was plenty of opportunities this week to get frustrated or when I short sided myself around the green to not stay focused.  I had a lot of 3- to 6-footers and I was able to make most of them.
I felt good all week.  Even today.  I was a little off, but I was still kind of in control even not being exactly where I have been the last few days.
Q. You know what the test will be next week.  You've gotten a cross the finish line before.  Given where your game is, where would you say your comfort level is going into Pebble?
WEBB SIMPSON: Very comfortable.  Never played Pebble with it being firm and understand it's typically firm for U.S. Opens there.  I'm excited for that.  I love the style of golf course where you have to shape it into the hole, you're hitting different clubs off the tee.
I think being in contention this week was only a bonus for next week.  Playing on the last group today, few groups from the last yesterday, and so it's only going to help for next week.
