 Q.   Obviously no one's played less that actually played.   Talk us through your day.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   It was a good day, man.   I hit one shot and they blew the horn.   We had an official there and they were trying to figure out if they were going to blow it.   It started coming down.   I guess they couldn't tell if it was going to be for a brief moment or for a long time.   They called us back.   So we went and marked our balls and came in.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever experienced anything like this before in competitive golf?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   Not as a professional.   I remember one year in Vegas in a collegiate tournament it was sleeting.   We all charged toboggans to our coach in the pro shop, and he wasn't happy about it.   
You know what, this is crazy weather, but we've got a great forecast for the weekend.   So hopefully it will melt tonight.  
   
 Q.   This doesn't affect your game plan at all pushing it back a day?  
WEBB SIMPSON:   No.   I mean, it takes me back to Hawaii.   I feel like I'm back there starting and stopping again.   You have got to go with it, especially in a match play tournament.   Every day you could be going home or going to the next round.   So I think everything is just kind of a little more laid back here in just knowing anything could happen.
