Q.   That was a tough match today.   You guys went back and forth.   It's been a great Ryder Cup, but sort of disappointing to finish this way? 
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, you know what, I had a peace about it all day.   You know, it's playing tough out here, and I was hitting some pretty good shots, just couldn't quite make any putts.   It was unfortunate to bogey 17 like I did, but Ian has had a great week and hats off to him.

Q.   Can you discuss 17?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, the last two holes I just pulled the iron shots.   You know, 17 is a tricky hole, and I felt pretty good over it, it was just a tough‑‑ it's a tough hole.   The last thing you want to do is balloon one and leave it in the water.   It kind of got away from me. 
Yeah, it's unfortunate to end it the way I did, but you know what, it's been an incredible week.   Hopefully we can pull it out.

Q.   The approach on 18, you just pulled it a little bit?
WEBB SIMPSON:   Yeah, I pulled it.

Q.   How far did you have?
WEBB SIMPSON:   152 yards, something like that.

Q.   What can you say about Poulter out there?
WEBB SIMPSON:   He's a great match play player, a great player in general.   A ton of respect for him, and I just didn't have my best today.   Unfortunately I got beat. 

Q.   When you saw that you drew Poulter, what were your thoughts?
WEBB SIMPSON:   I wanted to play him.   I've been playing good all week, and I know he's been playing well, so I didn't really care to be honest.   But unfortunately I lost twice to him this week, so that kind of hurts.
