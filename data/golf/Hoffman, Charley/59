Q. What's was it like for you on a day like this when you're out on the golf course?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Hit it solid, for me.  Obviously got to hit the drive to get it in the fairway.  Once you hit the fairway you have to hit the irons solid then hit the putts solid to the hole.  All in all, pretty good day.  Would like to have had a couple more but was happy with 2-under.
Q. The resurfacing of the greens.  What were they like out there today?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: The greens probably need another year to be really good.  The fairways were unbelievable in comparison to last year.  We picked up a lot of mud balls.  The fairways are unreal.  The conditioning of the course is a major improvement.  Hopefully a lot better for many years to come with Valspar.
Q. Thank you for your time.  Well done today.
