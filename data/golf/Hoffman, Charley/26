 Q.  Charley, good round out there.  How good was that -- was the round with two bogies on the card, too?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Happy with getting that start no matter where you are and what's going on.  Obviously looking back it would have been nice to make a few more putts, left a few putts short and lipped out a couple.  Pretty solid round.   
 Q.  What was working so well out there?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I birdied all the par-3s which was nice and obviously stole a few.  Usually you get pars on those holes around this place and you're happy.  I probably stole about three and a half, four shots from the field there.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you got a little boost after getting the Captain's Pick?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: No.  I'm just glad it's all over.  I'm glad that whole process of those couple weeks is over.  Hit me a little different than I ever expected that last week in Boston and it's nice to be done with it and go back to focusing on playing good golf.   
 Q.  With all the low scores that are out here today, just talk to me about the course just how -- maybe how easy it was playing.  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Little surprised.  Pro-Am the greens were real firm.  Got out there this morning and -- or this afternoon, the greens were a little more receptive.  I don't know what they did but the greens were definitely way more receptive today than yesterday.  Usually leads to low scores.
