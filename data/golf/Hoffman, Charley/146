 Q. 5-under par 67, got off to a hot start and leveled off through the round?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I played pretty good and made a bad bogey on 10. Tried to sneak is it down the left-hand side to get a little better angle on the second shot and I ended up in the water. 
 Besides that, I played pretty solid. Wind blew a little bit out there today, which made it a little harder.

 Q. Solid year, close to a couple of wins; what's going right for you?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I'm making the putts I need to. Last year I didn't make the 10-footers for par that you need to make to keep your round going, and sort of hold on coming down the stretch. Hopefully I can have a chance with a few holes to play, but I need some help from the leaders.
