Q. A pretty solid day. How would you assess your round?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, everything was good. I put myself in position pretty much all day. Obviously would have liked to have got the one up‑and‑down on 14 and then like to have made birdie on 15. 
But the swing on 16, it happens. It was a bad one. I was able to regroup and make a couple pars coming in, two birdie looks. But happy. I'm two back, I've been playing good golf and I'm really happy with where I'm at. 

Q. Is it tough when you know you've been playing good golf and it's just one swing that, going into tomorrow, you might be two back, but you have a chance still?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I mean everybody knows this back nine anything can happen. You can make birdies, eagles, bogeys. So it's the same game plan on the front, play solid golf and see where I need to attack on the back nine. Hopefully, I got a chance coming up 18. 

Q. You're still trying to get your first Major. What can you draw on tomorrow to help you possibly take home that Green Jacket?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I've been in the lead for 36 holes and more than that, almost all day today, and I'm playing good golf, and if I play my game tomorrow, I think I got a good chance.
