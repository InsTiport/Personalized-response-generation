 Q. Charley, with this wind I think any score in the red is going to be good, and you came up with a score of 69. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I played pretty solid. I didn't make a lot of putts, but the putts I made, a few birdies and only a couple bogeys.

 Q. Does the wind bother you? I'm thinking of your victory at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, when it was as windy on Sunday as any day on TOUR back in 2007?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: When you're hitting it good, the wind doesn't bother you as much as when you're hitting it bad, so if you're hitting it good, you're probably going to play a little better than the guys that are hitting it bad. Right now I'm hitting it pretty solid, so I'm happy.

 Q. Talk a little bit about the course and the redesign. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It's great. It's very visually pleasing off the tee now, a lot of good bunkers. The greens have got a lot of mountains. You've got to hit it in the right segment to have a good birdie chance. I think all in all, a pretty good redesign.

 Q. Have you had to be a little bit patient waiting for your second PGA TOUR victory?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I guess you can't force anything to happen, so I'm not forcing it, just hoping it'll come sooner than later.

 Q. You're always styling, a green and white hat, white shirt, green glove and green shoes, a very bold choice, but you're able to pull it off?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, it's a thing I do, Think Green, Keep America Beautiful, and also it was my birthday a few days ago, so I'm just helping to protect the environment a little bit.
