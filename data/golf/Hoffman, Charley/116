   CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I think mostly the soft greens make the course play easier but I'm not sure if the soft greens make this course play easier because it's hard to get the ball to stop when it starts spinning.
 The conditions earlier in the day were I think perfect, the conditions would be, the ball would take one hop and stop. If it gets much more rain, I think this course will play harder.

 Q. What's the talk in the locker room? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I don't think anybody has any clue obviously I'm pretty sure 100 percent of us want to play 72 holes out here and we all know the tournament doesn't start till Friday. So I'm pretty sure the players will commit to go to Tuesday if possible, but if this place gets ten inches of rain two weeks in a row, I don't know how playable this golf course is going to be on Tuesday if we do go to Tuesday. 
 So I mean, we have got to do what we've got to do to get the Playoffs in, and if it ends up being 36, 54, who knows. I'm sure they are going to try to get us all done tomorrow and get as many done on Saturday and as we can and see where we are at. I mean, there's not a person that doesn't want to play 72 holes out here.
