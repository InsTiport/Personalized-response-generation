 Q.   Charley, well‑played out there today.   16 of 18 greens in regulation, five birdies, no bogeys, that's got to feel pretty good?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, two weeks in a row with a bogey‑free round which is nice, so that means you're hitting some good shots and making some putts.   I'm happy to do that.   Obviously, going to be a few back after today, but we've got two more rounds and keep that greens in regulation up and everything will be good.  
   
 Q.   Looked like your swing was really a good rhythm out there.   Didn't feel like you were forcing anything.   At least it didn't look like you were?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, everything feels good.   I went to a new shaft this week, ironically enough.   The new Nippon shafts and it's been really good for me so far.   We'll see how it withstands the weekend.  
   
 Q.   What was the key to your round today?   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I hit a couple of errant tee shots, but there was not a lot of rough out there and I was able to get to the green from there, which is always nice if you get off position a little.  
The back nine which was my front nine I played well, and gave myself a lot of opportunities, and I'm happy with where the game's at.  
   
 Q.   Enjoying New Orleans a little bit this week?   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Always.   Going to go hit Jazz Fest this afternoon.   I love it out here.
