Q.   64 the lowest round here at the Travelers Championship for Charley Hoffman, that is before today.   Just how good is this round you put up here on Thursday? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I played good.   Obviously, 61 no matter where you play, is a good round to get off to.   I hit the ball early, just didn't make any putts.   Started going on the back nine, made the shot on 10 and sort of got it rolling after that.   It was nice after the finish I had last year to start like this.

Q.   Speaking of last year, how much is that on your mind, and how much does this round put that behind you? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Believe it or not, I was thinking about it going down 16, 17, 18.   If I could have just gotten those balls in play, I would have been defending champion here.   But this year, I got off to a good start and obviously a little more focused on those last two holes.   Hopefully I'm there again this year. 

Q.   So the 61, a career low.   You couldn't get the course record.   What happened out there? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Missed a few early, I guess, because I made a bunch coming in.   It's nice to shoot 61 no matter course record, not course record.   Obviously, in a good spot going into tomorrow and the weekend.

Q.   You made those two eagles and start on 10.   Take us through that shot on 10 as you drop it right in there in two? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, 10 is a tough hole.   I was a little behind the trees on the left side, hit a little draw in there and got a nice little kick and ended up disappearing into the hole.   That is definitely a bonus. 

Q.   When you see your score going lower and lower and lower, how do you contain that adrenaline and keep it channeled in the proper way? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   For one, it's Thursday, so you know every shot still counts.   You don't know when it's going to stop or keep going.   So I was just trying to keep making birdies, so I have chance to come out on Sunday. 

Q.   Could you have pictured a better start to this tournament? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Definitely not. 

Q.   Can't complain about this round, can you? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, it's nice.   It's nice to come back after that finish last year, and come back and shoot 61 and put myself back in the lead.

Q.   So that really played on your mind?   You were thinking about that as you walked down the course? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Definitely.   I played good golf last year coming into 17, and I was thinking about it a little bit.   I hit an average tee shot, but it stayed out of the water today.   It's nice.   Obviously, I've got good feelings around this golf course, play it well, it sets up good for me, and hopefully I keep making birdies.

Q.   How about that approach shot on 18? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, it's nice.   I was in the first cut of rough, so I didn't have a ton of control on the golf ball.   I was trying to land it short and have it run back there.   So it's nice when it finishes up less than a couple feet from the hole.

Q.   Can you talk about the eagle on 10? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I was down the left‑hand side just trying to get on the green and make a par.   It landed on the fringe, kicked a little left and disappeared.   It's definitely a nice feeling. 

Q.   Charley, the tooth, can you explain what happened there? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   The tooth broke at THE PLAYERS this year.   I haven't had time to go home.   It takes a couple weeks to get it fixed.   Got it re‑plastered a couple times, broke this morning breakfast, so just going to get it reglued.   Nothing major, no pain or anything.

Q.   Did you ever think about withdrawing? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   No, definitely not. 

Q.   You were thinking 59, 60 at any point there? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   After I made eagle, it sort of crossed my mind, but not for long.   I knew I had some chances coming in, but when all is said and done, I learned that 16, 17, 18 aren't an easy test.   So just trying to make some pars coming in and happen to make a birdie coming in.   Which is nice, and 61 is always good.

Q.   Any pain in terms of the tooth? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   No, the tooth is fine.

Q.   When you've had success at a course like this, can you talk about your mindset when you're starting off? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   You know, you're just playing one ‑‑ the old clichÃ© ‑‑ hole at a time.   It's just nice to see the ball go in the hole and make some birdies, and obviously, this course sets up visually good for me.   I can't tell you why or where it does, but I've been making birdies the last few times I've played it.
