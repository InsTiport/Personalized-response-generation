  Q. 4-under par 67 in these conditions. Pretty doggone good.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I got off to a little shaky start, chipped in for par on my third hole, which was the 12th. That sort of got me going, and then I made birdie on the next, and everything else was pretty steady.  
 Missed a couple putts coming in but hit good putts and all in all pretty happy with the round.  
  
  Q. And pretty good ball-striking, too. Tell me about that 12th hole. You were saying that David Toms hit 3-wood in. When you got to the hole were you thinking to yourself, man, how strong is this wind?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Oh, man, and then they tucked the pin over there on the right over the water. I hit a good drive in there and I hit a 4-iron and pulled it and almost hit it in the hazard left, then hit it in the hazard right almost and it went in. Somehow I got a par out of that hole and played pretty well coming in.  
  
  Q. How much different did the course play than yesterday?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Well, one, you got your ball in hand yesterday when it was perfectly dry, so obviously that made it a little easier. And then zero wind yesterday and it was blowing probably a good 20 miles an hour today and had to play it down. So it definitely played harder this afternoon.  
  
  Q. Was the course soft at all or were you disappointed with Earl?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: No, the course wasn't even close to being soft. I don't know if the sandy fairways absorbed some of the water, but I know Earl didn't dump as much as everybody predicted, which is good for us.  
  
  Q. What's the plan for the third round?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Just keep everything up, keep hitting a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. Feeling all right with my irons, hopefully straighten some things out on the range a little bit later and get it tomorrow.
