 Q.   Great solid par 66 today, though you have struggled this year.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Nothing great this year.   I haven't hit that great, actually coming in this week wasn't hitting that well.   My putter is looking good.   I had Shawn Callahan come in and look at me, along with other pro's, I was asking just about everybody for a tip or two.   Looks like I got it going, which is what you need when you're down, for the confidence level.   It was nice to finish 4‑under.   
   
 Q.   I don't think we've ever played together where you've not hit it solid.   I cannot imagine you going through this stretch; you've always been a good ball striker.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Exactly, that's the tough part.   When you get over a shot and you're not sure how far it's going to go, kept it solid and it goes over the green.   
Today I hit it good, hit it where I aimed, which was nice for a change.   It's definitely easier to play golf when you know where it's going.   
   
 Q.   Was the tip simple or more complicated?     
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   It's one of those things where I had to work through what I was doing wrong, and I had to have a few people tell me I was doing it wrong and work on it.   Golf is not easy.   
   
 Q.   Being stubborn is difficult, but you have to be stubborn to be good.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I'm definitely stubborn, I'm one of those guys, no doubt.   It's chipping away at the hard head and it feels good to shoot 4‑under.   
THE MODERATOR:   Great play, thanks.
