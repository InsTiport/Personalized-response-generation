 Q. Charley, 5-under today. Just what you needed to do to stick around for the weekend. Just comments on your round?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: To tell you the truth, it wasn't very good all day, again. I made a couple putts coming on the stretch. I chipped one in, and somehow I'm going to be hanging around here for the weekend. 
 Hopefully I can find something in my bed tonight and sleep on it and come out here and go real low this weekend. Hopefully -- 10-under, you can shoot this on this golf course, so hopefully I can get a good low one and have a chance to come in on Sunday.

 Q. There were some really low numbers this morning, and nothing wrong with 66, but was it just not getting to putt the ball?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: You know, I haven't hit it very good. I haven't putted it very good, didn't drive it very good. I haven't really done anything that great, but this golf course is soft. If you get it in the fairway, you can shoot at the pins. I mean the greens are perfect. 
 So you can make a lot of birdies out here. I mean they're out here, and people are obviously making them, and hopefully I'll get a few on the weekend.
