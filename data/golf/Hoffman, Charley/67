 Q.   Great shot into 18 to finish up well today.   What's the mindset when the golf course is in this type of condition?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   You still got to get it in play off the tee.   You don't get it in play, you don't get your hand on it.   You play off the tee, you're going to have a lot of wedges into soft greens and got to control your spin.   
So, I hit it pretty good.   On the back-9, shot 29 and hopefully give myself a bunch of chances tomorrow.   Hit a lot of good close shots.   Didn't make many putts today.  
   
 Q.   You've given yourself chances.   What has been so key to you putting up consistently good golf this year?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   My iron play has been really good.   I've been making the good 10-footers for birdie and par.   Would like to make a couple more 15, 20-footers.   Happy with everything.   Driving it pretty good and hitting irons close, making a few putts.  
   
 Q.   Last thing, what is the mindset when you know it's going to be a packed leaderboard on a golf course that's giving up a lot of birdies?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Make birdies.   It's pretty simple.   PGA TOUR on Sunday, it's whoever goes out and shoots low today.   Hopefully that's me.
