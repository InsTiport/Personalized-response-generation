   CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  After the first hole, I didn't get off to a good start, but nice charge coming down the stretch. 

 Q.  I guess you were buried in a bunker? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, I pulled my 3-wood left and I guess it hit a tree, and it dropped down, plugged, just tried to pitch out, thinned it, lost it in some palm trees or something like that. 

 Q.  There's that really thick stuff where you can basically lose the ball. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, so I dropped it again in the bunker.  I was half plugged, had a decent enough lie to go at the green, hit another tree, another palm tree, kicked dead left 50 yards, then tried to get back to the fairway, didn't do that, then hit a pitching wedge, tried to hook it on the green, plugged again, then got on the green and two-putted for a 9. 

 Q.  If this was a Monday qualifier at a PGA TOUR event, you would have probably walked off the course after the first hole. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Probably. 

 Q.  It's THE PLAYERS Championship, you came back and finished at 3-over.  Talk about your mindset after that first hole and what you kind of did to right the ship. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  My mindset was I was playing good golf so I knew I could at least have a chance -- I just wanted to play even par coming in, and that would obviously be my expectation, shot a couple under coming in.  Played good, and that's all I really wanted.  Actually I guess you really have nothing to lose after making 9 on the first hole.  You can only get better after that.  So it was good.  After the next two holes I beat my score, went 4, 3, so I was happy I beat my 9 in two holes combined. 

 Q.  Like you said, it kind of relaxes you a little bit, frees you up a little bit just to play golf and not worry about your score or whatever. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Exactly, it was nice. 

 Q.  Game plan for tomorrow on No. 1 is make a par? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, game plan is get it in play on the first hole.
