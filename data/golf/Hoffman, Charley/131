 Q. A solid 7-under par, 64. You democratically put those birdies all throughout the 18 holes of the golf course. Had to be a lot of fun. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I got off to a good start, great front nine, shot 5-under and then birdied 10, so got off to a good start, and then was fortunate enough to birdie the last hole to get it in for 7-under, and obviously no matter how the conditions are, 7-under is good to start off any tournament.

 Q. Somewhat of a gutsy play there in the first cut on the last hole with a 2-iron, you managed to take care of it?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: No, I actually only had 6-iron in there, so it wasn't that gutsy, but it was a tough shot in there on 18.

 Q. Your caddie lied to me then. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, he lied. It was a 6-iron. I had about 195 yards. It wasn't too gutsy, but obviously the water is always there.

 Q. Pretty good chip shot from the left side in the rough, a little negotiating angles there?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, the chip shot was actually a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I thought if I missed it over there it was going to be a fairly easy chip, and it wasn't actually. I hit a pretty big flop shot and it rolled down there within a few feet.

 Q. You went through the rain delay with your ball in the first cut out there at 18, so you didn't really see a lot after coming back out, but seeing what you saw on 18, do you think the golf course has changed much for the players in the afternoon?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, the golf course was pretty firm this morning all in all, but I'm sure a little bit of rain will soften it up a little bit. Sometimes it gets a little tricky, though. There might be a little skidding out there on those first bounces on the chips. 
 But I think it softened it up and made it a little easier. Got ball in hand today because of obviously the forecast for the rain, and that made the scoring conditions pretty scorable. 

 Q. Given the sort of ominous weather conditions this afternoon, are you happy to be done and out of here?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, there's no question. You always want to get in before the storm, and everybody knows it's going to come, just hopefully we get in all the golf. It's nice to be able to sit in the hotel room while it's raining.
