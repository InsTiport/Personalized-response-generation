  Q. Sorry it didn't go better.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, pretty disappointed. I'm not real happy with the way I finished. A little mental mistake on 16. I should have pulled the pin out there and gone right at it. I don't know what I was thinking. I hit it, ended up 30 feet instead of three feet. And then a bad drive on 17 sort of affected the way I played because I played good all week and just didn't get really anything out of it and sort of got frustrated there on 17. Obviously I had a good look on 18, didn't make it. Pretty much the whole week coming off the golf course I was wishing -- I had a lot of opportunities. Probably had more opportunities than most guys out there all week long and just didn't ever convert anything all week, which is pretty frustrating.   
  
  Q. At 16 you were chipping from where?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I was in the front bunker, and I was just trying to chip it up the hill. It was a pretty basic -- you chip it up the hill, it's going to come back down two, three feet. It's a no-brainer, but obviously the pin is in your way. Unfortunately it crossed my mind. Like visually, all right, you've got to barely miss this pin. I don't know why. Like after I hit it, it clicked in my mind why didn't I just pull the pin out.   
 Obviously first Masters, I'm going to learn from that, and I just wish I would have converted a few more putts.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about that first Masters experience altogether and just how you feel now that the four days are over, looking back?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: You know, pretty disappointed. I came here to win, and I didn't execute very well on the greens. I gave myself a lot of opportunities. I probably give myself an A+ from tee to green and position. But the putting, I guess it's sort of the year-long story; I haven't made any putts. If you don't make any putts, golf is pretty hard. I usually make my fair share. Hopefully they drop sooner rather than later.   
 Speed was off a little all week. Probably a little too tentative, if anything, but I guess your first time around this golf course maybe that's -- you sort of learn that you can be aggressive in some spots, and I definitely wasn't aggressive enough on the greens.   
  
  Q. Have you been doing extra work on your putting?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I did a lot of speed work. I did a lot of work after the first day -- when the downhill wasn't there, I worked on the downhill. It seemed to be all right the last couple days. But I just never gave enough pace and they sort of broke off the lines I was reading.   
 But gave myself a lot of opportunities, and in the future hopefully I come back. Wishing I would have made a couple birdies coming in to get myself an automatic invitation. But obviously those couple bogeys probably cost me.  
  
  Q. I was going to ask you that. You were kind of right --  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I knew if I birdied 15 and probably parred the rest I'd probably have a good chance of coming back. But I was just trying to -- I was still just playing the same golf I was all week. I missed a putt on 15, missed a putt on 16, 17, and 18. I just sort of never got it going.   
  
  Q. Driving-wise you felt good?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, drove it -- I mean, you're not going to hit every fairway. I'm never going to hit every fairway. I gave myself enough opportunities out here to make a lot of birdies, and I drove it good. The second shots, I executed, hit a lot of shots where I aimed. Pretty happy. First day was my only day I really shot -- had any really bad shots. After that I pretty much accelerated from the fairway.  
  
  Q. Not that it's any big concern of yours at this point, but Tiger being on the top of the board now, is that --  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: That's great for golf. I mean, there's no other -- I mean, there's no person that says -- it's great for golf to see him in contention. It's fun to watch. I'm sure I'm going to go in after I'm done today and watch the rest of the tournament. I'd probably watch it even if Tiger wasn't in the lead. But it definitely adds a lot of entertainment and it's good for the game.  
  
  Q. Do you think you were hearing Tiger roars out there?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Oh, definitely. He took me off the ball on 16 when the scoreboard -- I was over the ball and about to take it back, and the scoreboard changed from 8 to 10 when he made eagle, and I had to back off. And he wasn't even there, it was just a number change.  
  
  Q. And was it unique, the sound?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It's cool, yeah. I mean, it's cool. You sort of know what's going on out there. The holes are close enough together, and it goes through the trees. Hopefully I'm going to be making those roars, not listening to them.
