Q. Finished with a birdie.  Come up with a good taste in your mouth for the round?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I struggled getting the ball on the fairway the last nine holes.  I tell you what, this golf course is harder when you don't it between the fescue.
Q. Do you like your position going into the weekend?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, any time you've got a chance going into the weekend is what you want to be at.  I'm happy, going to go hit a few drivers.  Drove it great for the first 27 holes and a little sloppy there on the back nine.  Clean that up and have a good weekend.
Q. What did you think of the course today as compared to yesterday?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It was still gettable.  For the most part the wind was nonexistent.  There was a slight breeze out there and the greens were receptive if you were in the fairway.  You can still make birdies out there.  Like I said.  If you hit it in the fairway you can attack the golf course.  The back nine I didn't do that, which I made some bogeys and doubles.  But the front nine, I hit the fairways and hit the greens and made some birdies.
Q. To be in contention on a weekend at a U.S. Open, talk about -- it's a sporty event and there's theater involved.  And you're right there.  Talk about today.
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, you've just got to play the game.  It's easier said than done.  I've been in the situation, the last Masters and I didn't succeed very well.  And I'll learn from those mistakes and go out, and when it's said and done it's just golf.  But that's a lot easier said than done.  You can't look too far ahead, it's just a game.  And I look forward to the challenge.  I'm always up for it.  I'm not going to succeed every time and hopefully I can this weekend.
