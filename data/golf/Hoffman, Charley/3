  Q. How would you assess your round today?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Another good ball-striking round.  Hit it tee-to-green pretty good.  I think maybe the only green I missed might have been 17.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Obviously 6-under par is a good round of golf.  Would have liked to make a few more with the chances I gave myself out of the fairway but happy to be in contention going into Sunday.
 And obviously got a little weather coming in tomorrow and it's going to be a little bit different ballgame than it has been the first three days.
 Q. With that being said, how do you compartmentalize that, knowing that you have to go pretty low?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, you never know how much rain -- if it's soft, you can be more aggressive out here.  So if the wind stays up -- obviously the wind is the protector on this golf course.  If the wind is blowing, par is a pretty good score.  If it's just raining and soft, I expect a lot of birdies.
 I don't think the forecast is for too much wind, so I expect guys to still keep making birdies out here, and you've got to go low tomorrow and keep it going.
 Q. When you're in contention like this, is there a thought that you fall back on or remember from past successes that help you?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, just obviously the old clich√©, you've got to stay calm and confident out there.  You can't get ahead of yourself.  Obviously with this golf course, lending the amount of birdies it does, you can't just be content.  You have to keep firing at pins and giving yourself opportunities and if you don't keep the pedal down, someone is going to pass you.
