Q. How would you assess your round today?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Round today was good.  I drove it well.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities.  I actually obviously would have liked to shoot a few lower than I shot.  With the wind not blowing, I'm sure someone out there this afternoon is going to go pretty low.  I would assume the scores will be a little bit lower than they are, but tough pin placements and greens are perfect.
Q. Did the greens start to firm up a little bit?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Not yet.  I mean, if you get in the rough, they are a little bit different but if you're in the fairway you can control it pretty easy coming into the green.
Q. So do you figure you left a couple out there today that you wanted to get?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yesterday I didn't drive it that great.  I think I only hit about three fairways, hit a bunch of first cuts and shot 4-under.  Today, I hit many more fairways and shot 5-under.  Now, I'm not complaining.  I'm happy where I'm at but would have liked to take advantage of hitting more fairways and made more birdies.
Q. What's your mindset going into the weekend?  Continue to go low?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I think traditionally when the wind is not blowing here at Waialae, you have to go low.  You have to make birdies.  Even par doesn't cut it out here on the weekend or any week on the PGA TOUR, so birdies are a key.
