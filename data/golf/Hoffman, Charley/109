 Q.   Did you know that that par putt at the last was to make it to the BMW?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   No clue.   Obviously pretty disappointed how I finished on that back nine.   I was just trying to make that putt.   I had no idea at all.  
   
 Q.   At any point on that back nine did you realize where you were in the standings?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Obviously I knew I was close to top 30 making the turn, and all of a sudden I knew after the quad and the bogey that I thought I was out personally.   I kind of had calculated when I fell outside the top 20 on 17, and when I didn't make a birdie, I didn't think I really had a chance.   Obviously I was wrong.  
   
 Q.   We saw you holding your back a couple times.   Are you feeling okay?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I've got a twinge there.   It's been bad for the last month and a half.   It comes and goes.   It wasn't the reason why I played bad.   It felt fine over the shot, but I did get a twinge here and there.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the last hole.   I'm describing the action, but I'm not sure you realized that last putt if it had not gone in, you wouldn't be playing next week; is that right?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I didn't expect to be playing next week.   Really shooting 42 on the back nine, I don't think I deserved to play next week.   I guess I've got another chance.   I guess that's what the Playoffs are all about.   I wish I would have finished that off a little better than that.   Obviously I'm happy to go and play next week, but I'm not very pleased the way I finished it off, and I guess I've got some work to do.  
   
 Q.   Golf is such a fickle game because you were really playing solid golf until the back nine.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I had a threeâ€‘putt on 9 from close and then a bad bogey on 10, then bad luck on 11, hit a tree and went dead in the trees and couldn't get it out.   Besides that I missed a couple short putts.   But all in all wish I would have played a little better, wish I would have got a top 5, which I was trying to do, so a little disappointed.   But obviously I guess there's a little lining on top that I get to play next week.  
   
 Q.   You made that putt, and your little girl ran into your arms.   That puts things in perspective?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, my little girl is always happy and always fun.   Golf wasn't that much fun on the back nine, but obviously I've got my family, and I'm happy about that.
