CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  I just played pretty solid, no bogeys on the front.

Then birdied    I chipped in on the par 3.  10, 11, 12, got things going, made about a 25 , 30 footer on 13, and got up and down from a greenside bunker on 14, just missed a couple putts, but all in all a pretty good round.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  We just played a few junior events here every year.  I hung out in the parking lot and played a ton, but I definitely played five to ten times a year growing up since I was 13, 14 years old.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, for some reason the North Course I haven't been able to play worth a darn, and today I got it for once, which was nice.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  I think I had trouble on the greens.  They've always been    they were fairly soft today but they weren't real soft.  When you get poa annua, soft is kind of hard to make putts.  I made a few putts today, and that was the main key, making a few putts.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  I hope so.  Who knows if I'll be able to tackle that one.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  A few years ago before they made the changes I think I shot 5  or 6 under there.  Then I blew up on the North Course (laughter).
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  I wouldn't say mad, disappointed.  But I was pretty young.  As long as I learned from the mistakes.  I bogeyed a couple holes early that year and have learned a little bit hopefully.  If I happen to get off to a bad start tomorrow, I know I have a couple shots to lean back on.  South Course is tough.  You're probably going to make a bogey out there, and if I go through that round without a bogey, that will be something special.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Well, it was nice getting in on my number.  Tom Wilson promised me if I didn't get in, he would give me a sponsor invite.  In the past Century Club has been great to give me a sponsor invite throughout the year.  The three times I played as an amateur made my golf game the way it is today.

I never would have known what the PGA TOUR is like.  This is the only opportunity we have all year as an amateur to play in a tournament.  You see sort of where you stack up.  Usually you don't stack up and that's what makes you go out there and try harder, and you know where you want to be.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, it felt great.  I mean, it's what I obviously through my career have gone towards, getting a PGA TOUR card.  This would be the biggest win I could ever have, San Diego.  I think it would rank up there with a major.
JOHN BUSH:  Charley, nice playing.  Thank you.
