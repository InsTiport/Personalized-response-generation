 Q. Charley, a nice round of golf. Best of all, you get to go back and rest for awhile now.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I get the afternoon off on a Saturday, usually not that good, but today it's not too bad.

 Q. At one point in your round you had 4 birdies, 4 bogies and 4 pars. You rallied from that point on, played the last stretch at 2-under.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah. This golf course if you don't hit it with pin-point irons, you usually end up in a hard spot around the greens. If you don't get up and down obviously gives you a hard time. That's what happened with those bogies. I didn't put myself in position from the fairway and I didn't execute the iron shot in there. Everybody is sort of finding the same thing.

 Q. You've had rounds of 25 and 29 putts. Obviously that's worth a lot.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: The putter is working good. The first round wasn't so great. Today made a couple of good putts. These greens are a little slower than normal because of the undulation on them. After a couple rounds on them, it will be okay.

 Q. You have to finish on Sunday. Does that bother your wrist with 36 holes?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I don't think it makes any difference. It hasn't gotten any worse. I've been out here the last four weeks. Haven't played 36 holes but I don't think it's going to be a problem.

 Q. You played well at The Players, you played well here. Good luck this weekend.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I appreciate that, thanks.
