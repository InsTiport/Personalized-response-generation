 Q. Just some general comments on your round. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Today was a little different than the rest of the days, got off to a little slower start, 1-over until around 7 -- 6 or 7, made a birdie. Then turned at even par, and then I got it going a little bit on the back nine with a 3-under, pretty simple round, didn't put myself in too much trouble and was able to stay in contention.

 Q. How do you feel to still be within striking distance come Sunday?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It's great. That's what you try to do. You try to put yourself in position going into Sunday, and I've got a shot at it and hopefully I can perform tomorrow under the pressure.

 Q. How are you feeling after this third round?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Everything feels good, making a few putts, keeping the ball in front of me, the most important thing, and just hopefully have a chance coming down 18 tomorrow.

 Q. Speaking of the level of competition out there (indiscernible.)
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I think it's normal. In the morning the guys are taking it low, the guys that made the cut, pretty close to it, played some good rounds when it wasn't as windy and softer, and this afternoon it seems like everybody is pretty steady. The leader hasn't really ran away with it. It's about what you expect when it gets firmer and faster out here. It's harder to score.

 Q. They're expecting it to be a little cooler tomorrow. Is that going to be a welcome relief?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It's definitely going to be a welcome relief. I don't know how much cooler it's going to be, but I'll take anything.

 Q. Talk about what your mom meant to your golf game. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: My mom drive me to all those San Diego Junior Golf events and couldn't have been here without her.
