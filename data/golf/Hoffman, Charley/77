 Q.   Can you talk about the conditions out there.  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   There are still those pins that are hard to get at, no matter if they're soft, hard, or in the middle.   
But I think you'll see some low scores out there.   Obviously, I was lucky enough to get out there before the heat.   I think the heat is going to be more of an issue than the actual condition of the golf course.   
   
 Q.   When you come to the media center, you obviously did something right.   So do you feel pretty good?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Obviously, I never really been in a position like this, so I'm enjoying it.   
Hopefully, I'm going to take it all in and get out there and get after it tomorrow.   I still got 54 more holes to play and, obviously, it's nice to be in this position after 18 of them, but there's a lot of golf left.
