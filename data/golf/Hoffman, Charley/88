 Q.   Just how your day went.   Pretty -- 7-under, bogey-free?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   A good day.   Didn't get myself into much trouble.   Hit one squirrely drive around 15, the par-5.   But got back in position after that and everything was pretty good.   Hit some great iron shots and the greens were a real receptive in the afternoon.   Got lucky with the wind dying down and the cloud covering kept the golf course soft.  
   
 Q.   There were a lot of low scores this morning.   What were the conditions like this afternoon for the golfers?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   It was good conditions.   The wind didn't blow much and the greens were fairly soft for here.   It was a good day to get a few under par.
