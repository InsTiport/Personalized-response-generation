Q. Your thoughts on your singles match?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I would have liked to play a little better the last couple of days, but when it's said and done, it's a team event and we've retained the Cup and it's a great feeling.  It's going to be a good night to celebrate.
Q. Everyone is going to remember you and Kevin in your opening match on Friday.  How does this feel, your first International Team; this will go down as one of the great Presidents Cup teams in history.
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Behind closed doors, this is obviously the best team I've ever been a part of, but everybody else says it's one of the best teams put together.
It's been fun to be a part of this team and just sort of ride some coattails and have some fun.  Really enjoyed it and hopefully get on a couple more before my career is over.
