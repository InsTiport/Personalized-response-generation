 Q. Charley, Michael is still recovering from his jet flight on Monday. You obviously recovered from yours. Nice 68 today.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah. Definitely have a new found respect for all those Air Force pilots and what they put their body through. I was going to be the guy that didn't throw up. You always hear of people throwing up. I guess I was that guy. 
 It definitely takes a toll on your body like no other experience I've ever had. I don't know if I'll ever do it again. It definitely was a lot of fun and also shooting 4-under was a lot of fun today.

 Q. It does take quite awhile to get over that. Get your head feel like you're back on solid ground today again.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It took me a good day to get feeling better and I mean you can mentally prepare all you want for it but you're not going to do it. Once your body tells you it's time, it's time. So no, I'm glad I did it on Tuesday, not a Wednesday and it definitely felt good today.

 Q. Let's talk about the around. Very well played, particularly your second 9. You got it going, 14, 16, 18 to finish.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah. Hit a couple of shaky tee shots. Hit a shaky one on 2. Found it, was able to make a par. After 10 I hit it down to the right and had to take an unplayable. After that I drove pretty good. Made a couple putts. 
 Today was the first round I can think of all year that I made a lot of ten footers I need to for birdie and par. It's definitely a good feeling to keep rounds together and get them going.

 Q. How huge an adjustment golf-course-wise from last week, though? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Green-wise the undulations and stuff are pretty close. The green speed, a little different, which is fine. You get prepared for that early in the week, but little more windy out here. But in Augusta you can hit some wayward drives and still find them. Here you hit some wayward drives, you're out in the rattlesnakes. You got to keep the ball in front of you and then you can attack once you're in the fairway.

 Q. You found them all. Good work. Good luck.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
