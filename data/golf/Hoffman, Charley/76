Q.   Charley, a bit of a two‑sided coin here, today, four birdies on the front side and three bogeys on the backside.   What changed for you?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   You know, front nine I played good.   And the back nine, my speed was off on my putts and I missed a few greens and didn't hit that great.   All‑in‑all built some confidence.   It just didn't turn out. 
There are some lumps and bumps in these greens that are hard to handle.   I would like to have been a few less, but I've got a chance on the weekend.

Q.   Some guys like Jimmy Walker played well.   Do you feel like you lost ground by shooting even par?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I mean even par was probably a very average round out there today.   These greens are rolling so good, if you get it in the right spot on the greens you can make a bunch of birdies out here.   I wasn't in the right spot and the holes I was didn't hit very good putts, so it ended with an even par.

Q.   The about the weather conditions.   So drastic yesterday, even though you played later, and it was a bit calmer.   Very much different than today.   When you play in those conditions do you concentrate more, everybody, or is it let down a little bit because it's perfect conditions and maybe you don't concentrate as much when the weather is perfect?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   The greens got firm and fast there on the back.   And I didn't hit a ton of greens, so it's hard to attack when you're not hitting the fairways or the greens. 
But I think you can get this golf course, if you drive it in play and hit some good irons shots, but I obviously didn't do that on the back, like the front nine.   But I've got a chance.

Q.   You're feeling good going into the weekend?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Of course.
