 Q.  All in all, considering everything, pretty good day.  How nice is it to finish with an under par round with the that's weather coming in?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, the first nine holes I made a couple good putts.  The second nine I missed a couple close ones.  Early in the round I made some nice birdie putts, it just feels good, had good speed going.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your round?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I got off to a great start.   Anytime you can make some birdies out here it's good.  I feel good.  If you would have said at the start of the day, blowing 15, 20, with a chance of rain, that I shot under par, but  I would have like to get more out of it.  This morning it was okay.  I mean it's hard to play.  It's hard to make four or five footers, 6 footers, it's tricky, keeping the ball below the trees.  I got off to a great start.  Made some birdies out here.  It's tough coming down the stretch.
