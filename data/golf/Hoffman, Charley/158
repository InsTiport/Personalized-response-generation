  Q. Charley, 3-under 69. That was a solid round. I thought you played real solid.  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Gave myself a lot of chances. Drove the ball great today. Could always make a few more putts coming down the stretch. Hit a couple bad iron shots coming in. I'm ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Like the way you play this course. You don't pull out the driver much, only on the par-5s, right?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: When it sets up for driver, I pull it out. When it doesn't, I hit the 3-wood and give myself a little longer shot in. The greens are receptive, so you don't have to get up there too close.  
  
  Q. You're playing so solid. You feel you can -- you've got one low one in there.  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: If I get the putts to drop like I did the first day. I think the last two days I actually hit it better than I did the first day and shot the lowest on the first day. It's all about getting the putter hot and hopefully I can get it warmed up a little bit.  
  
  Q. You won before, a year ago. You're in position today?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I made a lot of good clutch putts coming down the stretch there to try to pull those memories out and hopefully watch the ball go in tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Real solid. Keep it going.  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Thanks a lot.
