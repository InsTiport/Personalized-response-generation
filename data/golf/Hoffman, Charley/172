   JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Niece round out there today, why don't you just talk about your round, playing over there at Bermuda Dunes, and then we'll go into some questions.  Just talk about your day out there and the course, the conditions, the weight, etc.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  We'll start out with the frozen greens were a little tough to begin with first off.  It was extremely tough, I didn't know what was going to happen with the ball.  Fortunately they did a good job on the par 5 and I was able to get the ball on the green on the fringe and 2-putt for birdie.   
 Then played kind of conservative with wedges because you don't know whether the ball -- birdied four or five, knocked it like four inches on 5, and then parred the next hole, parred the next one, the par 5, I got sort of lucky.  I just pushed the tee shot a little bit right and stayed out of the water there and knocked a 3-wood up on to the front of the green and was able to 2-putt for a birdie.   
 9, by that time the greens had got soft enough where we could actually go to the pins and put it to a foot on 9.   
 Then we came to the turn and waited for about 45 minutes but was able to practise a little bit and stay loose, hit a few putts.  Made a few more pars, the par 3, around 11, 12, knocked it a couple inches and made a birdie there.   
 And then I made a birdie on the par 5, 14.  About my only putt of the day it, was about 15 feet, made that for birdie.  Unfortunately 3-putted the last hole for par.   
 JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  How long was that putt on 18?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  The eagle, it was probably around 45 feet I would say, knocked it about six, seven feet by.   
  
  Q.  On those early holes on the greens, were you conservative because you thought the wedge might hit and bounce through because the greens are still very hard?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, you were I was worried about going over, I saw on one hole the ball landed on the green is it actually sort of checked up.  That part of the green was really tricky.  It wasn't really fun golf, just trying to get through those first few holes and not make bogey, especially out here.  You're usually trying to make birdies from a one hundred yards.   
  
  Q.  Was that true with the putting as well as the wedges or just the wedge shots?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Putting, actually I thought the greens were going to be faster because they were so hard but they maintained their speed, they were very average, not too fast, where you could make a lot of putts, unfortunately I didn't make a lot of putts but you could judge the speed and had to be careful not to let them go too far by.   
  
  Q.  I just wonder what you think about playing in the A Group, if any of the fans or the personalities over there get in the way, and two, as a southern Californian, growing up in San Diego, is it bizarre to see the weather here?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, I haven't spent a ton of time in Palm Springs so I always thought it was usually a little warmer than this.  It's a little different.  But at least we were able to prepare a little bit for it.  It's definitely a little different playing in the normal 75 degrees out here and it's perfect out.   
 Playing in the A Group, it doesn't bother me.  I don't mind it.  You know going into it that this tournament is the Bob Hope tournament and you know that there's going to be people having fun and it's just good to see people out here watching.  You know what you are going to get yourself into and obviously you always want to play well.  But every year it's the same, it's not like there's something new.   
 JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, CHARLEY.
