 Q.   I think that you won everyone over when you threw the ball in the stands?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I just wanted to get rid of that ball.   It was going everywhere and it finally ended up in the hole.   Hopefully someone got a nice souvenir there.  
   
 Q.   How were the conditions out there today compared to the last couple of days?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Well, I think it was good.   It was starting to firm up a little bit.   All in all you were able to get at it today.   There were some funky pins.   You expect that with a USGA event.   I can make birdies, but you can make bogeys fast.  
   
 Q.   Are you hoping Mike Davis is in a good mood?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I think I need him to be in a bad mood.   A couple of guys are playing under par, I'm quite a ways back, so I need some funky pins and a little bit of luck.   
   
 Q.   Overall your experience here at Merion, this course is extremely tough.   How about the crowd?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   You know what, the golf course is second to none, really.   Logistics and walking around are a little tough.   But the crowd, the golf course, it's fun to be out here.  
   
 Q.   Do you think even par could win this thing?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Oh, 100 percent.   I bogeyed the last three holes without winking an eye, so it can happen real fast.
