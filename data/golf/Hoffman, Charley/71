Q.   You beat the defending champion, he's been a really special player in match play, what does it feel like?
    CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   You know, I just kept the ball in play.   I hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens and made a few putts coming down the stretch for some birdies.   He struggled a little off the tee today and I took advantage of it a little bit. 

Q.   You win four holes in a row.   The match is actually even after you bogeyed 10, but talk about the stretch, especially at 12 and 13, you made a couple of nice birdies there?
    CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   11 was a big swing.   He hit it in there really close.   And I had a 5‑, 6‑footer for par, and he missed and I made.   And I was able to roll in a birdie on 12.   And he didn't make that one.   I was able to make a birdie on 13.   It was a nice little finish there and it's nice to get done early.
