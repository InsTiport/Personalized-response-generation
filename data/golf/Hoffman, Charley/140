  Q. The way he played today, did he look like a guy who in the past had trouble closing out a tournament?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: He didn't look like he had trouble today, that's for sure. Unfortunately I couldn't keep up with him, but he played great.  
  
  Q. You guys are good friends. Do you think that gave him a comfort zone, and how was he during the course of the round? Did you guys chat?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, we chatted the whole time. It seemed like he was very confident. He played great. He didn't look like he was -- he looked like he was playing out there on Tuesday, didn't look like a Sunday PLAYERS Championship round for sure. He didn't miss a shot, and he played great.  
  
  Q. How much has it weighed on him?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: There's no question it weighs on you not being able to close it out here. He's won internationally plenty of times, played Presidents Cup. He's a great player. Hopefully it's good enough for him to break through.  
  
  Q. The tee shot on 17 was obviously very nerve wracking and very tense. It seemed like you guys were able to relax. What did he say?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Oh, he wanted that ball to get down to the hole, obviously. It was a pretty good shot anyway. He hit a great shot. You couldn't -- I mean, he landed it right where he was looking every time. It was fun to watch.
