   CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I came in second last week and obviously another Top 10 this week and hopefully keep the momentum rolling next week for Pebble.   
  
  Q. What would you like to work on between now and then?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I made some mistakes. The first two rounds I only had two bogeys, and in the last couple I had a triple and a double and a few other bogeys, so without the mistakes I'm right there.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: No, the weekend I just didn't drive it as good as I did the first couple rounds which makes it tough to make pars and sometimes make double bogeys and triple bogeys.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about your position in the FedExCup?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: FedExCup, I mean, it's early. I'm just trying to play good, solid golf and hopefully get myself in position for the FedExCup and have a chance to win that.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I hit it a little hard on 1 and they said it got up in the tree and it never came down. It's the first time that's happened to me, the ball getting stuck in the tree. Unfortunately it's something I didn't have any control over, so that didn't really upset me too much.   
  
  Q. So many chants going out there. I know you heard it all day.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, it's always nice to have locals and it's always nice to play well in front of them. It's nice to be supported by everybody.
