   MARK STEVENS: We welcome Charley Hoffman. He's currently co-leader at -5. Give some general comments about your round today and we'll take questions.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: General comments was I drove it pretty straight for me, and the fairways got narrow out here this year, and I kept the ball in the fairway. If you keep the ball in the fairway here you can attack some of the pins and make some birdies. Luckily enough I was able to keep the ball in the fairway the majority of the time, which obviously gave me some birdie chances, and took advantage of the par-5s and birdied all of them.   
  
  Q. How do you feel 5-under will fare knowing the guys are going out in the afternoon?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I think it's going to be pretty good. The fairways are real tight, like I said, and the greens are getting firm even in the morning. I think it's going to be tough for guys to score out there. The greens are perfect and they're rolling good, but I think it's hard to get a lot of shots close to the pins. I think 5-under is going to be decent. I'm not going to be shocked if someone shoots 7-under, but I think all in all a pretty good start.  
  
  Q. Do you think you need to put together four days like this to win this tournament?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I never know here. I was playing a practice round early in the week, and every year I can't believe how low the scores are here. Obviously I need to keep it going to usually end up in the lead at the end.   
  
  Q. How does a round like today just kind of change your mentality heading into day two? Do you approach it the same way or do you --  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I mean, I'm going to approach everything the same way. You've got to keep the ball in the fairway out here this week, and that gives you some chances to make some birdies. I'm a pretty aggressive player so I'm going to be attacking the pins, and hopefully that pans out for birdies, not bogeys.   
 MARK STEVENS: Thank you, Charley.
