Q.   What a great run.   Five birdies in a row on the front side of the Nicklaus Private. 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, gave myself a ton of opportunities today.   Made one bogey with a sloppy 3‑putt. 
Made an 8, was looking at eagle and ended up making par.   But all in all the middle of the round was nice to make a bunch of birdie and happy with where I'm sitting for sure. 

Q.   Let's talk about 8, the par‑5, great tee shot and it could have been a lot worse with the second.   It hung on the edge there.   When you look back on that hole, what do you think to yourself?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   To be honest with you, I'm aiming for the middle of the green, because if I miss it left, I'm not going to be able to get it up‑and‑down, so I was taking an aggressive line and pushed it a little bit, got lucky.   Actually if that chip carries probably two more feet it's probably pretty close.   But all in all happy to get out of there with par, because I thought I sunk it in the water after the second shot.   So like I said, pretty happy.

Q.   You're 14 under, but that's only four back at this point, but I guess that's the nature of this beast, isn't it?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, we got two more rounds, so it's sort of, two more rounds, different golf course than everybody else, so coming down the back nine, if I got a chance I'll be happy and hopefully I do.

Q.   Off to the Palmer private for your third round tomorrow.   Your thoughts on playing that golf course?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   If the weather stays the way it is, all these golf courses have a lot of birdie holes.   You can get in trouble out there.   There's water, there's trouble if you short side yourself, but all in all if you're hitting good shots the greens are good and you can make a bunch of birdies.
