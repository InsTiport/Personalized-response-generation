 Q.   Certainly not the easiest day for a lot of reasons.   Just a few comments.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I actually hit the ball all right today, I just didn't make the putts like I needed to make yesterday.   And really was in the tournament the whole time, and hit a bad shot on 14 and sort of went south of there.   Threeâ€‘putted 17, thought I had a good shot on 18, got a gust and ended up short.  
All in all fairly happy.   It was tough conditions and I didn't capitalize on the situations that I had.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned yesterday that you weren't concerned about the wind, you've won in those type of conditions before.   Did it play out like you expected it to?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I actually hit more fairways and greens than I did yesterday.   And the shots I hit good didn't turn out like I thought they were going to turn out.   The wind gusting and sometimes it doesn't work out, and it didn't work out today unfortunately.   Obviously I would like the good ones to turn out a little better and make the par putts, it just didn't happen.  
   
 Q.   How good a round was it from Webb today?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   It was great.   He capitalized where he needed to capitalize.   And hit some good shots and made some good putts, and played good golf.
