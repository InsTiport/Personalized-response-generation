  Q.  Charley, you had the all Vegas group today.  Have fun out there?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, it was a good group.  Good amateurs we had, good guys, and I played all right.   
  
  Q.  You did play very well.  You shot 5 over, 67.  Looks like the wind is supposed to blow the next couple days.  You're from here and you know what this wind is like.  Do you think that gives you any kind of an advantage?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  I think everybody that keeps it low to the ground is going to be all right tomorrow.  I mean, who knows?  If it's projected at 25 miles and hour it's going to be tough, and I don't -- these greens are so fast I don't even know if we're going to be able to play.   
 Hopefully it doesn't blow so hard golf gets canceled.   
  
  Q.  D.J. Trahan gave us a little insight into your activities this week.  Are you have fun?   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, D.J. is staying at my house.  Looks like we put together two pretty good rounds, and hopefully we can keep it going.   
  
  Q.  Well good.  Good luck the rest of the week.   
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Thanks.
