 Q. Good day for you, talk a little about your round?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I got off to a decent start right after the delay. Made birdie on that hole and then I birdied the 10, 11 and the long par 3, 13. Stole one there. 
 Played pretty solid and made a sloppy little bogey on 15 the par 3. 
 Made a great birdie on 18. Seemed like I birdied two of the hard holes today. 
 Then I bogeyed unfortunately 2, and I made a bunch of pars and birdied my last three. 
 So it was definitely a nice finish, so trying to get the round done and really got done and definitely felt good to get the round done with three birdies.

 Q. That storm blew through, and seemed like it was pretty calm after that. 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I had never seen it -- I mean, haven't played out here a lot, I've only played three or four tournaments out here, but definitely have not played anything that calm out here before. And then with the little bit of water that it got, definitely some birdies out there. 

 Q. Take us through the last three holes real quick if you can?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I think the main thing I was concentrating on was making sure it played fast enough and get in the house so I got some extra sleep. 
 But hit it real close on 7. Hit it to about 2 1/2 feet and made that and then 8 I hit a bad drive and had to lay up and I hit a decent wedge shot in there about 12 feet and made it up the hill and hit a good 9-iron to ten feet and made that and made a good putt on the last two holes to get in the house.
