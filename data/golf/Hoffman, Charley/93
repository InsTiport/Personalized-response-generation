Q.   First off, finishing the round with a birdie is always a good feeling?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, played good, made a couple of bogeys coming in.   And then obviously finishing off with a birdie on 18, especially when you hit it in the rough, is definitely an added bonus.

Q.   That hole is a bear and it has been all week?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   There's a lot of bears out here if you miss the fairways.   Fortunate enough to draw a decent line, intermediate cut, and had a chance to go for it.   With the greens being soft, it stopped pretty close to the hole.

Q.   Seemed like you had it going pretty well on the front nine, had a few birdies out there?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, you know, I played solid, made a few putts, made a couple of bogeys.   And when it's said and done, 3â€‘under par with the conditions easy, I'll take it all day long.

Q.   How did the conditions change with the rain this morning?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   I mean, it's soft.   I mean, earlier in the week it was definitely a premium to hit it in the fairway, to stop it on the green. 
You could get away with a little bit out there yesterday and today if you missed the fairway because the ball would stop on the green.   It's definitely softened the course up a little bit from the practice round, but it's obviously still holding its own.

Q.   Heading into the weekend, what are you looking for?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Just keep doing what I'm doing.   Hopefully I'm putting a lot of balls in the fairway, driving it good, then hitting good solid iron shots.   Just keep that going and hopefully I got a chance on Sunday.
