Q.   Boy, Charley, that is a great way to start there, 3‑under in the first round.   Talk to me about the conditions a little bit.   It appeared those winds were gusting and maybe were a challenge out there for the first round? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   It was cold and windy this morning when we teed up and dark warming up.   It was blowing and cold.   The first hole played long, the first few holes, and coming down the stretch at the end, it was back into the winds. 
But the wind blew pretty good on the end and never really warmed up, and the ball wasn't going too far.   Pretty difficult out there.

Q.   Overall pleased with what you've been able to do in the first round of this tournament? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Yeah, I made a bunch of good birdie putts in the middle of the round.   Had a couple three‑putts.   But with these greens the speeds they are and the pin locations, I'm not really that disappointed with it.   But all in all, pretty happy to put the ball in the position I wanted to and made a couple of putts, and I'm happy with three under. 

Q.   Can you pick out a couple of memorable putts from the first round that got it going for you? 
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   18 I got 200 yards into the hole and a 4‑iron into the wind, so pretty happy with 18.   Obviously, that's a tough shot.   I hit a lot of good shots where I was looking today.   Didn't really make a ton of mistakes and made some good birdies.
