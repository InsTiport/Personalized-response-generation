  Q. How do you feel about the wind today?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: The wind is not going to affect the ball as much. A ball striker is definitely going to be better in the wind than a guy who is not striking the ball.  
  
  Q. Do you like wind?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I'm a fan of wind. I've been hitting it good all year. I depend on the wind.  
  
  Q. Everybody talks about your hair.  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Everybody talks about my hair. No one talks about me if I didn't have my hair. They wouldn't talk about me if I didn't play good golf. So it's a little bit of both.  
  
  Q. Charley, tough conditions out there today, but you still played pretty good?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Shot 2-under. The wind didn't blow quite as hard as it did yesterday. It's definitely out there. It's fun to watch.  
  
  Q. One guy shoots 8-under one day. One guy comes out and 7-under and 2-under the next day. Were you guys kind of feeding off each other just two days apart?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Exactly. His putts went in today, and mine went in yesterday. It's fun to watch the guy you're playing with make some putts and birdies.  
  
  Q. What kind of adjustments have you had to make from playing courses earlier in the year with a lot of thick rough to a golf course you come to now that isn't a lot of thick rough?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I probably like no rough. I'm probably in the rough more than anybody. I enjoy it. You don't have to think so much off the tee. You can hit the driver up close to the green.  
  
  Q. What are the greens out like there the second day?  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: They're as good as they are. You start on line, you're going to make a putt.  
  
  Q. Great playing out there the second round. Have a great weekend, Charley.  
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Thank you.
