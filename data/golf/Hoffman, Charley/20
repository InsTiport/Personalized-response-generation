Q. Talk about that moment and the celebration.  The match didn't go the way you wanted but that was a pretty cool moment.
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, we obviously wanted to end that today.  We knew what was on our shoulders.  I didn't have my best stuff all day long, but I had a chance.  Got to give it up to Lahiri.  He made some great birdies coming down the stretch, and they knocked us off.
