Q. The conditions were a little different today.  Just your thoughts on how it went.
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I played pretty well, just a silly miss there on 7 from about two feet.  And then I was right in position on 8 to Marc birdie or attack and I hit a sand wedge in the water and made bogey there.  Then made a bogey on 9.  So that stretch sort of derailed me.  I gave myself a chance coming down the stretch, but just missed that putt on 17 that, obviously, would have given me a chance to Marc birdie on 18.
Q. When you have that stretch like you did on the end of the front nine there, how do you flip that back and get back at it?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I knew there was a couple birdie holes up there, like I said, I wasn't playing horrible, just needed to get the putts to go in.  And I gave myself a couple easy birdies and then, obviously, Kisner helped us out a little bit by making a couple bogeys there.  But got pretty much everything I could.  I had a chance, proud of fighting back and making a birdie on the last to finish second, but obviously not what I wanted.
Q. Being the 36-hole leader and coming into this situation, knowing that -- how do you build off of that and use this as more experience to know that you're continuing to put yourself in position?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: 36, 54-hole leaders, it's nice, but you come out here to win golf tournaments, not lead at 54 holes.  So, obviously, Arnie's is a special place, first year he's not here, would look to have finished a little differently, but all in all happy with a second place finish.
Q. The positives you take is the fact that you really did battle back today more than anything?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, I battled.  Kevin opened up the door for us to come back a little bit.  Second is, it's bitter sweet, obviously I look back on some putts that didn't go in, but obviously a pretty exciting week all in all.
