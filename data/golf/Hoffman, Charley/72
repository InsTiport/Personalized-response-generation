 Q.   Doing great today.   And Charley is doing even better, he just won his match on the 17th green.   What got you to the finish line today, Charley?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   A little lucky.   I won one hole with birdie today and Zach won one hole with birdie.   It was pretty dismal golf out there, to be honest with you.   I just happened to come ahead at the end.  
   
 Q.   We've heard a lot of people say it's been some dismal golf the first couple of days.   Is that because of the players or because the golf course is playing difficult or a combination of both?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   The rough around the greens are hard to chip and the greens have a little bit of grain in them so it's hard to putt.   You have to chip pretty close to make those 4‑ or 5‑footers for par.  
Yeah, par is a good score, but when you make a birdie you usually win the hole.   
   
 Q.   You have a match against Branden Grace tomorrow.   
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   It's nice to get a win today.   I can practice here a little bit this evening.   I was a little shaky on my irons today.   I was able to get the W, but have a little bit of work.  
   
 Q.   Going into tomorrow you advance, is that a good thing?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN:   Of course.   Obviously you want to always control your own destiny, but I think I have to play a little better golf than I did today to advance.   And so I'm going to go work on it and hopefully I've got a chance on the weekend.
