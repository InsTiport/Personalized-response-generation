 Q.  Good, solid round.  Looking at the numbers, it looked like it was pretty flawless?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, didn't make any bogeys which is always nice.  Had a couple nice saves for par which always keeps the round going and obviously in a decent position going into the weekend.   
 Q.  How different was the course out there from the first round, any difference?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Oh, yeah, the first round was shooting darts, trying make birdies on every hole.  Today you had to play a little defensive here and there and I was able to make a few putts today, which is the reason why I got 6-under.   
 Q.  Is it different when you get down in the valley?  Is the wind swirling a little?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I wouldn't say it's swirling.  It sort of goes along with the valley.  I'd say it goes down the river, like wind gets down the channel, it goes that direction, and when it's up top, it stays pretty consistent.   
 Q.  You've been getting in contention an awful lot this year.  What are you learning as you go on through the year?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I've learned that I haven't closed the door yet, which makes me very eager to get the job done.  I've won the last couple years, so obviously sort of running out of time.  Got some big tournaments coming up, and hopefully I can close one off this week.
