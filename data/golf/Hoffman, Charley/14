 Q.  First of all, we're seeing some of the top players in the world out there with massive numbers, big, big numbers.  Just talk about your round and the struggle or the challenge out there?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: For me, I hit a lot of fairways, so you can play this golf course on the fairways.  The holes I got out of position, I was able to make bogeys.  That's really all you can ask for.  Just trying not to make a big number out there.  I was able to get a nice couple birdies early, which on this golf course is always nice.  Birdied 10 and 13, and it just sort of got me off on the right foot.  Hit fairways and gave myself opportunities.   
 Q.  They wanted wind in '04, and it didn't come off, but they certainly got it today.  How challenging was it, compared to the practice rounds?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: For me, I've never played this wind.  I played a little bit of wind on Tuesday afternoon.  Intentionally I played more holes because I knew the wind would come up a little bit.  This golf course is getting firm and fast, and it's going to be a challenge this afternoon for the guys.   
 Q.  Brooks Koepka was talking today, with a 5 over he shot or something, he said, but you're right in it with a number like that.  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: That definitely doesn't shoot you out of the tournament 5 over par.  1 under leading.  I doubt we'll see anybody go lower than that this afternoon.  Six shots back after one round isn't going to kill you.   
This golf course -- just opportunities.  The pin placements are tough.  You've got to hit the center of the green, so you've got to then make a longer putt for birdie.  It's hard to knock one in there close and have a tap-in.  You've got one reachable par 5 that is really the only real birdie hole.   
 Q.  So your takeaway on the round?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Happy.  I missed a couple of par putts I wish I would have made, but blowing 15 and on the side of the hill pin placements, you're not going to make all those four and five footers.   
 Q.  Was there any change in the velocity of the wind during the day?  Did it get windier?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I think it was pretty steady.  It felt steady.  The only difference was it got firmer.  Obviously, this morning, with the little bit of rain you had yesterday, you could hit some shots that were receptive in the greens.  This afternoon or later in the round, you were just trying to sort of hit the center of the greens and go from there.
