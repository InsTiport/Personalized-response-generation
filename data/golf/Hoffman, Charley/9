 Q.  What a super round of golf:  Seven birdies, no bogey on the card.  Tell us about it.  You were really rolling the rock today.  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, got off to a good start.  Obviously birdieing first two holes is always the way you want to start.  Then made some good crucial par putts, some good 2-putt in the middle of the round on 9 and 10.   
Made a couple errant swings on 12 and was able to make birdie with it, and cruise on in from there.  Very happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  What were the conditions like out there?  The weather forecast seems like it's been the same every day; if you're playing in the morning you have maybe a little bit better chance to put up a low number.  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, first few holes wasn't much wind.  By the time we get to 8, 9, 10 it started picking up a little bit.   
But, you know, it's consistent; a little blustery, but you got to hit it solid to have a chance out here.   
 Q.  Fairways.  It seems like when you guys are hitting shots you can see the dust and dirt flying up.  How firm are they?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, you know, yesterday I didn't hit many so I didn't know.  Today I was in a fair amount of them and it was nice to get some good solid contact in there.  If you get them running in the fairway they do roll a bit.   
 Q.  You're inside the Top 5.  Are you going to keep on eye on this leaderboard going into tomorrow?  
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: You know what?  I can't control what they do, but just going to be in a lot better position than I was and I got a chance going into tomorrow.
