   CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Kept myself in the tournament.  Today I shot 5-under, left a few out there for sure but all in all not too bad. 

 Q.  (About making the cut). 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Yeah, I have no clue what the score is.  Over there you really don't know where anything is.  I'm sure I'm within five or six of the lead obviously would love to have a few more.  But I've got a chance to play on the weekend. 

 Q.  How different was it yesterday and today with the wind blowing? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  The South is always tough no matter if there's wind or no wind but the North played a little tougher today.  It wasn't extremely easy out there. 

 Q.  What about the crowd? 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  It's always nice to have some local fan support out here out here.  There are usually a few out here but there were a few more after the win. 

 Q.  (About changes since winning last week for the first time on the PGA TOUR). 
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN:  Made it a lot harder, a lot more media, not as much time to myself to work on my own game.  Little different, little different challenge that hopefully I can get used to.
