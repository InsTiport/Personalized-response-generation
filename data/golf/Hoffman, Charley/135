 Q. 3-under par, 67. Looks like it's going to be probably the low round of the afternoon. Talk about your round today and how the golf course was playing out there.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: First off, without saying anything, it's hot. It was hot and humid out there. The course is playing pretty firm. Not real fast, but it was firm. You just try to seek shade and get through the round, I guess.

 Q. Tomorrow morning looks like, if it's anything like this morning, y'all have the better end of the deal tomorrow morning. Where do you go from here now with 3-under par, got to feel pretty good about where you are?
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: You go into the air conditioning from here. No. Tomorrow you just -- obviously it's a little softer, the greens are softer in the morning, and hopefully get some birdies before it starts heating up.
