Q. Nice playing out there today, 7-under par 65.  What's it like when you go from one format on one day to the next?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: It's weird.  I enjoyed yesterday more, actually.  I don't know why.  Yesterday was a lot of fun.  But today a little bit of struggles in the middle of the round, and then we played good on the back nine, which is the front nine, just didn't make many putts for birdie.  But all in all, pretty happy with the 7-under.
Q. Nick the what was the key today?
NICK WATNEY: Somebody was always in pretty good shape.  We had a slight bit of stress, as Charlie said, around the middle of the round, but he made birdie on 18 when we kind of played that hole a little scraggly, and he rolled in a nice one there and kind of gave us a boost in momentum, and then we played pretty solid on our back nine.  No bogeys around here when the wind is blowing, we'll take it.
Q. The wind picked up a lot more than yesterday.  How different did the golf course play?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Yeah, you know, this course is hard.  It gives you plenty of room, but you've still got to hit some good shots.  The pins were they were is hard to get them real close with all the nooks and crannies.  When your partner hits it in there close, you're trying to push in there close, too, and sometimes it doesn't work out, but all in all, we gave ourselves a bunch of birdie putts, and we're pretty happy with 7-under.
Q. You guys are veterans of New Orleans; what's the plan for this afternoon?
CHARLEY HOFFMAN: I may hit the Jazz Fest up for a little bit.
Q. Nick?
NICK WATNEY: I'm going to probably -- I'm definitely going to get a nap in.  It was an early morning.  But after that, who knows.  I've got two small kids, so we'll go do something I'm sure.
