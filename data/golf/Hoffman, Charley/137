 Q. Disappointing to bogey the last hole but all in all 4-under par, 68. Solid round. Just talk a little bit about your round today.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Started with a bogey and ended with a bogey. Everything else in between was great. I got one of the few bad shots, good par saves in the middle of the around. All in all, pretty good. My golf game feels good and hopefully keep it going the rest of the week.

 Q. Talk about how the golf course played this afternoon compared to maybe how it played during the practice rounds.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: Definitely windy during the practice rounds. Today probably the front 7, 8 holes there was some breeze out there but it calmed down definitely out here on the back-9. I don't know that that necessarily means this course plays easier because the downwind holes are a little longer, they're not downwind anymore. 
 So this course is tough no matter what. You hit a good drive, you have to hit a good second shot on these greens, anyways. I'm sure the guys in the morning obviously blew a little more and played a little harder. Looks like the scores were better. Who knows.

 Q. You mentioned you've been playing pretty well, you had a nice finish last week at The Players. Just talk about where you are right now with your game confidence-wise and where you go from here for the rest of the week.
 CHARLEY HOFFMAN: My game feels good, real confident. After last week -- I finished bad last week. I was in probably the top four, five and I finished last five holes 5-over and obviously dropped me down quite a few spots but just learn from that and keep it going this week know that I'm playing good.
