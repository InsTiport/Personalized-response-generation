   KELLY ELBIN:  Massy Kuramoto, ladies and gentlemen.  In with a 1-under par 71 in the opening round of the 68th Senior PGA Championship.  Three strokes behind leader Eduardo Romero.  He will be speaking through his wife.   
 Massy, can you give a sense of what it was like to play in the conditions this afternoon, please?   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  It was about the time when I started the wind really started to pick up and it was very difficult.  But it was from behind up to 14.  And it really got tough after, from 15, because I had to keep playing into the wind for about nine holes.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  Open it up for questions, please.   
  
  Q.  How difficult is it to play into the wind for that nine hole stretch which you go through there?   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  It's playing into the wind and with the wind is both as difficult.  When the wind starts to come from the side it makes things worse.   
 But in this kind of wind, depending upon the height of your ball, your total distance differs so much.  And that's really what's hard to calculate.   
 And because the green is up higher, the feel for the distance makes it very, very difficult.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  Could you go through your three birdies and two bogeys in terms of length of putts and so forth.   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  11, I hit it to five or six inches.  Just missed an eagle.   
 13 is about 15 feet.   
 18, two yards.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  Then the two bogeys on the front nine.   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  Bogey the third hole.  Second shot short and then a chip and a putt.  It's about three, six feet.  Missed it.   
 Next hole is about the same.  Missed it six feet.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  Questions?   
  
  Q.  Can you compare the wind out there today to other tournaments or other courses where you play?   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  When I qualified two years ago at the Q-School in California the Santa Ana winds for blowing for six days and it was worse than this.  So it's since then.   
 I've played in the Open, the British Open a number of times, but it's the same, the same applies there and here.  But you know you're going to miss the greens, so you try to make sure that you're approaching into the wind.  If you're going to miss it, that's the better way to miss it.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  For the record, this is Massy's second Senior PGA Championship.  He missed the cut last year at Oak Tree.  Questions?   
 Was there one hole in particular that stood out as perhaps the toughest most demanding of the holes today?   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  17 and 15.  15 and 17.   
 KELLY ELBIN:  What did you hit into 17?   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  17, I hit a 3-iron.  I tried to hit it in the left bunker.  That's in.  Good shot.   
 (Laughter)   
 KELLY ELBIN:  Questions?  Massy Kuramoto, thank you very much.   
 MASSY KURAMOTO:  Thank you very much.
