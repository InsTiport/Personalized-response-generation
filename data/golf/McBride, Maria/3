 Q. First round, tied for 136th, and you have played the last 42 holes 11‑under par. How on earth have you turned this around?   
MARIA McBRIDE: I don't know really. It's really just coming down to a lot of confidence and trusting myself. Obviously played the 12th hole Thursday, 9‑over par, and all of a sudden I'm 2‑under par. So really you have to trust yourself in these conditions, and yesterday was really, really tough.   
But, you know, felt like I have had a chance to at least maybe make the cut, and just kept on going. Really, really focused and hit every hole‑by‑hole. I didn't really make many putts, but I hit a few close and made what I needed to.  
   
 Q. You came off after the first saying that was possibly the worst round of your career and you came off last night saying it was possibly the best in the world's conditions.   
MARIA McBRIDE: Yes, I think that's why you're attracted to golf. You never know what you're going to get the day that you walk out there. Today was better; obviously good after yesterday, and came out today and played solid. Could have made a few more putts coming in but very happy with the situation and where I'm at right now.  
   
 Q. This is your best performance this year, since 2011. I just wonder what a relief it is to turn the corner in terms of your performance.   
MARIA McBRIDE: Yeah, I had a few tournaments earlier on this year, finished fourth in Texas and Top‑10 in Atlantic City, so I had the game going a little bit.   
I kind of lost the feeling a little bit off the tee the last couple months, and worked hard with David Leadbetter this week and we found something to obviously turn it around. It's always great when you get a little bit back. Obviously I'm older compared to the girls playing out here, so it's nice that you can have some good scores.
