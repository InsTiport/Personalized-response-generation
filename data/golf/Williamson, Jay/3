   JAY WILLIAMSON: Made a couple of putts today, some loose shots, working on something new on my golf swing, so I'm hitting a lot of really good shots and every once in a while throwing a clunker, but I'm happy with where I am. 

 Q. You said you made putts, 27 and 26 putts to be exact. That's great with that long stick. 
 JAY WILLIAMSON: It's a new putter, and it's from TaylorMade, called "The Ghost," and it seems to be helping this week, a little more weight, and my stroke feels better. I made a good one there on the last hole. 

 Q. It's called "The Ghost" because the face is white on it; it looks like Casper? 
 JAY WILLIAMSON: It is, and it's got a great feel. It's basically the same color as the golf ball so it's interesting. 

 Q. I thought you caught a bad lie in 8 and you ended up making bogey, and it could have slipped away at 9, too, but you made a good putt. 
 JAY WILLIAMSON: You know, the golf course is playing difficult. It's tricky, not physically demanding but a little more old style, which is good for me. You don't have to bomb it off the tee, which is good for me, but you better be in the fairway. 
 It's nice to see you Fred. I'm tired of having you follow other people in my group, so it's fun to see you. 

 Q. It's also nice to talk to a fellow St. Louis guy. Could you talk about the swing a little more? 
 JAY WILLIAMSON: When I was in Puerto Rico, I didn't play well, made the cut, and on Sunday I just decided this isn't working. I've been doing this for too long, so I'm trying to get the club on the plane in my backswing and it's difficult for me because I have to actually elevate my hands a little more than usual it's not real natural for me but when I execute my golf swing I can hit the shot as well as anybody so I'm excited with that. 

 Q. Thanks.
