Q. Great round of golf, 66, bogey-free, but brilliant short game today.  I walked 15 holes with you and you were getting up-and-down from everywhere.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, you seen my good side of the day.  Yeah, I did well, got up-and-down -- I had a lot of up-and-downs today, like between holes 7 to 12, I think I had bunker shots and rough from everywhere, even on 17, and I knew long was not good, and I still got up-and-down.  It's been one of those nice up-and-down days, and then I grinded pretty well and I stayed patient.  That's why I was able to finish with three birdies on the par-5s.
Q. You hit the ball, as well.  You have to to make six birdies and no bogeys, but you weren't happy with your second swing on 16, but it was a brilliant third.  Walk us through your third.
BYEONG HUN AN: No, it was not the easiest shot.  It was downhill, trying to hit a high cut from it.  That's why I think I hit it fat a little bit.  But the bunker shot, I got lucky there, too.  I wasn't trying to pitch it in the rough, but I didn't know what it looked like, but my caddie kind of told me a couple hops and it went on the green.  So I got lucky there.  I tried to make a par out of that because I knew it was a tough bunker shot, so that was a bonus there.
Q. You come to 18, you're 16-under, you get up to your ball.  Were you ever thinking to go for it?  Was it always going to be a lay-up on 18?
BYEONG HUN AN: You know, it was in the rough, but if the pin was on the right side of the green, I think I would have gone for it, but because the pin was on the left, I know the left bunker is not the easiest, so I didn't take the chance.  The worst I would make from a lay-up was a par, so I just wanted to give myself a birdie putt.  It was a nice third shot, but putting saved me.
