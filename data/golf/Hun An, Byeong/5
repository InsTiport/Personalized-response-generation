Q. Great round for you out there today.  Can you talk about it to us, please.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, it was better than yesterday.  I made more birdies.  And obviously the calming condition helps.  And the greens were rolling better, obviously.  Yeah, I was driving it better and gave myself birdie chances.  Everything clicked.
The bogey on 16 was a shame.  But it happens.  Bogeys definitely happen out there because it's a tough golf course.  I'm quite happy with 4-under.
Q. Can you talk to us about the 16th, because it's a really tricky hole.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, I missed my tee shot.  It wasn't like I got an unlucky break.  I deserved a bogey, to be fair, it was a poor tee shot.  Went a little short, right.  Wasn't a terrible lie, hit a good chip to about six feet.  Missed the putt and it was a bogey.  Bogey happen really easily out here.
Q. I'm sure you had a very early alarm set.  It probably hurt a little bit, but it's nice to come out and play in the calm conditions.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, especially like this, the weather can change every single hole.  I think playing early definitely helps.
It's a little less sleep.  But if I can play in the good greens and play in the calmed conditions, I'd love to wake up at 3:30 every morning.
Q. You've played yourself right into the mix heading into the weekend.  What's the game plan for the next two days?
BYEONG HUN AN: Game plan, just like today, I think.  Trying to -- I'm not going to make any silly mistakes.  Just be patient because bogeys definitely happen and if it doesn't, great.
I just need to be patient and accept what you get, because you can get some funky bounces and lucky bounces.  So be patient and try to play my golf.
