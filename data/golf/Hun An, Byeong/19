Q. How would you assess your first round today?
BYEONG HUN AN: It was good.  My ball-striking was really good to be fair.  I hit one bad shot.  That's it.  Other than that, it was perfect.  It was solid hits.  I had birdie chances on almost every hole.
Ball-striking was probably the best so far this year.
Q. Were conditions reasonable out there for scoring?
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, no wind definitely helps.  And no wind, small greens, small targets, but greens are not that firm yet, I guess.  So ball holds up on the green pretty nicely.
I think I hit it pretty good, and also the no wind definitely helped.
Q. Do you think today's round will restore a bit of confidence that might not have been there coming into the week?
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, definitely.  I haven't been -- playing well, but just had too much golf, I guess, the last couple months.  I tried to get refreshed.  Last week wasn't my week because I didn't like cold weather on a links course.  But this week, I felt pretty good and I got ready.  I prepped nicely.
So yeah, this course is going to suit me because everyone hits in the same spot and you've got some long irons.  But ball-striking, like I said, that's why I was able to shoot 6-under par today.
Q. Does it inspire you to be in a Rolex Series event?
BYEONG HUN AN: It's a very prestigious event and I love being here.
