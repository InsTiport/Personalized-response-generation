 Q.  Pretty close to the lead, two or three back heading into tomorrow.  Talk about that.  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, it was bogey-free again.  That's quite nice out here.  And I could have made a lot more birdies, I guess.  I mean, yesterday I feel like I hit it better.  And then just today I was struggling on the greens with the speed.  I left a lot of putts short today.  Bogey-free, 3-under, that's not too bad here.   
 Q.  Did you find the greens slower today than the first two days?  
BYEONG HUN AN: I think so.  I think it was a little slower, I think.  But I tried to get used to it quickly but I couldn't.  The greens are slow, but I should have been used to it.  But I couldn't do that.   
 Q.  What kind of mentality are you taking into tomorrow this close to the lead trying to win at Jack's place?  
BYEONG HUN AN: Just the way I've been hitting the last three days, if I do that I think I'll have a great chance tomorrow.  Putts didn't fall yesterday and today, but hopefully tomorrow will be the day.   
 Q.  Do you kind of look at how tough this place does play?  When you won the BMW a couple years ago how difficult that course can play and how well you played there?  
BYEONG HUN AN: There I went out and I hit a great.  I didn't have to make a lot of putts.  I hit it really close every time.  I think the same will be needed here.  You have to hit it close and not miss any fairways, because the rough is quite juicy and long here.  So you have to drive it well and hit it well and try and give yourself plenty of birdie chances.
