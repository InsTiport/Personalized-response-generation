Q. Excellent start right out of the gate. Talk a little bit about that start and also your round as a whole.
BYEONG HUN AN: It was playing easier, I guess, the first couple holes because the wind is completely -- not completely but like a 90-degree change from the last three days. My first couple holes were playing a little bit shorter and a little bit easier, so I took -- hit some great shots. Most of them I hit pretty decent. I had 10 feet on the first hole, I think, and made some good putts, and then it was a grind all the way through. It was playing quite tough and the wind started to pick up a little bit more. It was flawless until the last like four-hole Bear Trap. I just missed some birdie putts and par putts.
But if I made all of them, I think I would have had a great chance, and then it would have been a perfect round. But I'm quite happy with where I am, since the first round I think I was like 120th after the first round. I was packing and ready to go home. But always getting top-10 finishes is great, and especially after where I was after the first round, I'll take it.
