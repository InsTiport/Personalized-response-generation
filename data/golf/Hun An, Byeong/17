Q. You found eight birdies out there, really well played.
BYEONG HUN AN: Eight birdies?  Oh, I didn't know that.  Well I knew I had a lot of bogeys and birdies but eight birdies is pretty good out here.  I played pretty well.  Obviously 4-under at the end and made some good shots and just those birdie putts I think that you are all like pretty close.  I think I birdied every par-5 and that helped.  I think it was good overall.  Putting was solid and it was a little shaky start but it was good at the end.
Q. Very good at the end, if you consider the 9th hole, your 18th hole of the opening round from out of the rough you gauged the release on the green just perfect, about two feet away.  End the day with a birdie.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, I didn't have the best lie in the rough, obviously the rough is pretty thick and I had to give it everything I had and it worked out great.  I had just enough room to get to the flag, so it was quite lucky, could have been worse, but I'll definitely take that shot.
Q. You mentioned the rough.  I think it's substantial already, you really have to be careful when you're in it?
BYEONG HUN AN: Definitely, you can get some lucky lie, to be fair.  Like 8, the ball was sitting up nicely, it was almost too nice and I got right under it and hit it in the water, but there's some lies you can get really nasty.  Like first hole, the left side of it.  But some other holes I think you can get away, but most of the holes you know where you have to miss it to avoid this rough.
