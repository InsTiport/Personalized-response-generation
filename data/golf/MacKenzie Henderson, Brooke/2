Q. Obviously you've been pretty consistent these past three days, was that your goal coming into this tournament?BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: Yeah, definitely.  I played in the U.S. Open last year and I made the putts, and that's something I wanted to do this year.  Luckily, I was able to do that the last few days.  Going into today, I wanted to hit fairways and greens.  It sounds simple, but it can be very difficult.
Q. Obviously, you're representing your country.  What does that mean to you?BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: Oh, it's great.  The national team, I love playing for them.  I have great coaches, great teammates.  Even out here today, because we were hearing, "Go Ontario.  Go Canada."  It's pretty neat.  Canadian golf is certainly growing, and it's nice to have the fan support.
