 Q. Not a great spot, but you're here for the weekend.  Talk about it.BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: Yeah, I'm really excited.  My goal coming in was to make the cut and then climb up on the weekend and that's what I'm going to try and do the next couple days.  I left a couple shots out there today, but it's a tough golf course and you've got to take what you can get.
Q. What rose up and bit you?  What were your problems about the course?BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: I missed a couple fairways today, which isn't good on this golf course.  When I missed fairways, I bogeyed.  It's tough to get up-and-down out of there, but I also made some good up-and-downs around the greens, which really saved my round.
Q. Tomorrow, strategy, hopes, what are you looking for in the third round?BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: Definitely to climb up the leaderboard.  It is moving day.  Hopefully I can move up a little bit.  Definitely try to limit my mistakes is a big thing.  Hit fairways, hit greens, sounds easy, but definitely it's something that you have to do around this golf course.
Q. Last question, the word "patience" has popped up a lot today.  You have to take your medicine sometimes.  Given that tomorrow's moving day, can you maintain that patience or how do you approach it?BROOKE MACKENZIE HENDERSON: Yeah, you have to stay patient out here.  This golf course can jump up and bite you at any time.  You've got to hang in there.  And definitely today I was definitely patient for awhile there and made two birdies on my back nine to help keep my round in there. Definitely tomorrow just stick to my game plan that I've been having the last two days and just stay patient.
