LIANG WEN-CHONG:  Yesterday my short game helped tremendously in the wind. I got up and down a few times to save pars and was even par through nine holes. But today's condition was near perfect and I didn't take the opportunity to shoot a better score. However, we got lucky with the draw as some other players have to play 36 holes today. I'm just going to practice a bit now before calling it a day.

It was good to play with Luke Donald and Nick Faldo. I've played previously with Faldo, so I was watching Donald play a lot more and it was good. I think I have to change my practice habit a bit more to be more consistent with my game.

I've had two top 10s in European Tour events in Malaysia and Singapore, which were good. I feel like I'm getting better after working on my swing with Kel Llewellyn. He's going to spend a few months each year in China from now onwards which is good as I can see him more regularly.

My long game has improved a lot but my short game has let me down a bit. So I need to work on that aspect to become an all-around player.

I'm going to play in the BMW Asian Open next week in Shanghai and then spend time in Japan. I need to play a minimum of 14 events there to keep my card for 2006.
