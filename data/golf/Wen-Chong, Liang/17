   LIANG WEN-CHONG:  I'm very happy with my start. The conditions were good for scoring early on but unfortunately I didn't really take advantage of that. My concentration was a bit off early on and I had a bad double bogey on the 16th (he started from the 10th). I shanked my five iron tee shot and ran up a double bogey. I can't remember when was the last time I managed to do that. 
 I birdied the next hole but on the 18th, I sent my second shot into the water from 214 yards but managed to get up and down for a par. It was a big mistake. On the back nine, I managed to hit some good shots coming in and holed a few good putts. 
 My neck feels a bit sore (he withdrew last week because of injury) so it's a bit of a concern. I have to warm up well before I start the round and make sure it's okay.
