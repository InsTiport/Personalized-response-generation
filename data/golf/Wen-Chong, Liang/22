   LIANG WEN-CHONG:  I drove it well today, only missed one fairway. That makes things easier. I had numerous birdie chances on the front nine but only made one, on the fifth. Missed three chances from inside eight feet which was disappointing. Started to hole my putts on the back nine. I knew that if I kept going, it would fall. So I was happy to finish with a 67. 
 On the par fives on the back nine, I was two on the green and had 20-foot putts for eagle. I've been playing all right this week but my putting in the first two rounds was not working at all. I've been stroking the ball rather poorly but it was a lot better today. I'm going to keep trying tomorrow and see if I can produce another five under round. 
 I've had a good start to the year on the Asian Tour and have done enough to keep my card for next season. If I can have a strong start when the Japan season starts, then I want to go to the US PGA Tour Qualifying School later this year. 
 A win in Japan would be nice as it would give me the winner's exemption. I played in one event in US last year (The International) and I enjoyed it. I've played both the Japan and Asian Tours for several years now and I feel I should try the US Tour now. That would be my goal.
