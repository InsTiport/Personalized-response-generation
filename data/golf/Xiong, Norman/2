Q. Scrambling there on the back nine.
NORMAN XIONG: Yeah, a little bit.  It was tough.  It's just a narrow course.  It's soft and wet, so, yeah, it's not going to play easy.  Grinded it out a little bit on the back.
Q. Good first stage and then good start here.  Is there something you've learned or progressed over the months since you turned pro?
NORMAN XIONG: Yeah, just getting better, more used to it.  Right when I turned pro was a little bit overwhelming I guess.  I think I've done a really good job of learning and getting used to it.
Q. What's maybe felt different?
NORMAN XIONG: Honestly, I don't know.  I can't say.  It's just experience.  It was kind of like that through every stage of my career, so this is I guess a little bit expected to take a little time and get used to things out here.
Q. When you said learning, being paired with other players the events you've played already, is there anybody that you kind of picked something from their game and seen what they do?
NORMAN XIONG: Not anyone exactly, but I've noticed that everyone out here is really good and that they handle their emotions really well.  That's something that's totally different than amateur, junior golf, and college golf.  So I've learn a lot from that.
Q. When was the first time you felt comfortable with pro golf?
NORMAN XIONG: Today.
Q. Okay.
NORMAN XIONG: I mean, still not comfortable yet.  Still learning a lot.  Hopefully I'll get more and more used to it.
Q. What was the best recovery shot today?
NORMAN XIONG: Recovery shot?  Maybe the one on 16.  Hit it right and was in the pine straw.  Just hit it low.  Little puncher to about 25 feet, which I'll take.
Q. Yeah.  And then I think like a 56-footer out there, too.  Wasn't there a long one?
NORMAN XIONG: Yes.  Yeah, on hole 13 or something, 12, yeah, par-4.
