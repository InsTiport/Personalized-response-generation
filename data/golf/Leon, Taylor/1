  Q. Tough bogey at the last, but otherwise a great day. Can you just tell us how you played.   
 TAYLOR LEON: Yeah, I played pretty consistent. I hit the ball pretty well and I putted really great, so that's probably where I saved the most shots.  
  
  Q. Does that last hole make you want to go practice a little and get back out there?  
 TAYLOR LEON: Yeah, it makes me want to (indiscernible) a little bit. But it played really hard the last few holes, especially with all the wind that's coming in.   
 So I'm happy with my round either way.  
  
  Q. How much would it mean to have a great finish here?  
 TAYLOR LEON: It would be great. I've started playing better the last few tournaments, and I would love to finish it with bang, especially in Texas.   
  
  Q. Did the wind really pick up just as the day went on? How did you adjust?  
 TAYLOR LEON: Yeah, the front nine was pretty calm, and then once we made the turn, the back nine was pretty windy.   
 I just tried to keep the ball pretty low. I grew up in Texas, so I'm kind of used to the wind, which is good, I guess.  
  
  Q. Talk about your year. You mentioned you really picked up the last three. I mean, is this your second full year on tour?  
 TAYLOR LEON: Yes.  
  
  Q. Has it taken a while to get into the swing of things?  
 TAYLOR LEON: Yeah, I had a rough start, but I really have started playing well. I think I'm getting more comfortable every tournament I play, which I think makes a big difference out here.   
 But I've I just started to putt a lot better, which has really helped.  
  
  Q. Houston is like four hours away from Dallas...   
 TAYLOR LEON: Yes.  
  
  Q. How nice is it to be back in your home state?   
 TAYLOR LEON: Oh, it's the best. I actually lived in Houston for about four years, so I always love being in Texas. I'm glad we have a tournament here.
