Q.  How do you feel you played today and is the course playing any longer than it was yesterday or any differently?
DON REESE:  I don't think it's playing any longer.  I made a couple doubles which kind of gummed up my day.  And just didn't play that well.  Didn't play bad, but alls it takes is a couple swings.
