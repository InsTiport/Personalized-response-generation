 Q.  How pleasing was that, bearing in mind the toughness of the golf course?  
JEFF WINTHER: Well, I played really solid today obviously.  I got a few unlucky bounces and a few missed putts, but I'm really pleased with the round.  I played really well.   
 Q.  How key was patience out there today?  
JEFF WINTHER: Very.  I tried to keep it in the fairway most of the day and it actually went quite well until the last two holes, and then I had to sort of save myself.   
But I really played well and it was -- the putter was good, although the greens were a little bumpy at the end, obviously we're close to being last out.  So I'm pleased, really pleased.   
 Q.  3-under through five.  How crucial was that in the context of the round?  
JEFF WINTHER: It was nice, because out here, as you say, patience is key, and getting three birdies on the first five holes was really nice, a good start.  You don't need to chase the birdies.  You sort of just need to get pars going and then you get maybe a few birdies here and there.  So it was really nice.   
 Q.  Coming off a good weekend in Sicily, what did that do for you coming into this week?  
JEFF WINTHER: Well, I had a really good weekend in Sicily.  I didn't play particularly well the first two days.  I made it on the mark thanks to an amateur, so I can thank him.  And I played really, really well on the weekend.  Didn't miss a lot of shots, actually, so it's just riding the wave out hopefully.   
 Q.  Obviously top 64 is crucial, getting into that final match play, stroke play.  Is it consolidation now for tomorrow?  
JEFF WINTHER: Well, obviously I don't have to attack the course tomorrow or anything, so it will be nice just to, well, not lay back, because you still need to hit really proper, good shots, off the tee, especially.  Well, it's a good start.  We'll take it one day at a time.
