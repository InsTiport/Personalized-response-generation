 Q.  A 69, were conditions slightly easier this morning?  
JEFF WINTHER: No, it was a little different.  It was slightly colder, that was the main thing but otherwise it played pretty much similar I think.  It was a good test as usual.   
 Q.  Pleased with that round then?  
JEFF WINTHER: Yeah, I played really solid.  From tee-to-green, I didn't miss a lot of shots.  I only made one bogey today and that was because of a divot, so I can't complain.  I played really well.   
 Q.  How crucial is that around here tee-to-green?  
JEFF WINTHER: It's really, really important.  If you're a little off on the tees, you get punished really quickly, every hole, basically every hole, yeah.   
 Q.  Obviously looking like being one of the seeds, are you aware of how important that is, being one of the seeds, going into tomorrow?  
JEFF WINTHER: To be honest I haven't thought about it one bit, so I'll take one day at a time at usual.   
 Q.  What particularly pleased you most about your play over the last two days?  Is it the continuation of last weekend?  
JEFF WINTHER: Definitely.  I feel like I keep playing well.  It's just hitting fairways, hitting greens.  I just need the putter to work a little better and then I'll be hot.   
 Q.  Do you feel your game is strong enough to win out here?  
JEFF WINTHER: Definitely.  I think so.  At the moment, I do, definitely.  Anything can happen in this match form on the weekend, so it will be interesting to see.   
 Q.  And how much are you looking forward to the format the next two days?  
JEFF WINTHER: I don't know, I haven't -- as I said I haven't thought about it but I think it will be fun.  Back home we usually play division golf, that's proper match play.  This will be a little different but it will be fun.
