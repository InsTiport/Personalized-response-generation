Q. 4-under par, how good was that to start?
JEFF WINTHER: That was beautiful.  I played really solid today.  I could have holed a lot more putts.  I had a lot of putts inside four metres that I missed, so I'm pleased, but I'm eager to get more.
Q. What is it you've done particularly well:  Keeping it on the fairway, giving yourself chances?
JEFF WINTHER: Keeping it on the fairway.  Meaning, I have a new driver in the bag this week, so I'm really pleased it's going quite far and quite straight, so it's nice.
Q. Sometimes it takes a little while to get used to new equipment.  This one has bedded in straightaway, has it?
JEFF WINTHER: I've tried it a couple times before, but I keep going back to the old one.  I'm pleased I brought it this week.  I need a bit more length, because the course is a bit wet.  You don't get any roll.  You need to carry it a long way.
Q. In general terms, how happy are you with the form on The European Tour and the progress you're making across the season?
JEFF WINTHER: I'm actually quite pleased.  It's tough mentally but it's getting better.  I think I'm getting more routine for every week that goes on but it's great.  And I'm getting -- yeah, all the other guys, I know a lot of the guys now, played together all the time.  They are great lads, all of them.  I'm quite comfy on the Tour now I think.
Q. Tough mentally, though, because?
JEFF WINTHER: Yeah, because as soon as you miss the cut and you think you've played all right, it's hard not to break.  I played K Club; that was a great tournament, great venue.  I played really well.  I played 30 holes in the rain and some of the guys didn't play one.  That's just unlucky, but I played really well and missed the cut by one, so that was mentally really, really tough for me.
