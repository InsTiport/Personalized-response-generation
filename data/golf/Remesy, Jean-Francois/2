Q. Are you satisfied with the 72 today?JEAN FRANCOIS REMESY: I am.  I am.  I'm pleased to be here and pleased to be playing in a Major, my second Major.  I just turned 50 last year, so playing in a PGA event.  I played 2004 and 2005 at Whistling Straights.  But Major tournaments in America, I love it.Q. What was key to your round today?JEAN FRANCOIS REMESY: To be patient.  I know that this golf course demands a lot of iron play and you have to be, from the tee, definitely on the fairway, to get the most opportunity to have a nice shot from the fairway. But I've been patient.  I've been patient.  I missed putts at the end, but I'm really satisfied.  Normally, I would be angry because I finished level par instead of 2-under, but I have to be -- but I'm pleased to be here and pleased to be in contention.
