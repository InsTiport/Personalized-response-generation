 Q.  You haven't made it to 18 this entire time.  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Talk to me a little bit about how that feels and how solid of golf you're playing right now.  
JENNIFER CHANG: Well, I can't believe I haven't made it to 18 yet, but like my game right now is just really solid.  Putting has just been the key all week so far, and my ball-striking, it's pretty good, but I think it comes down to putting.   
 Q.  So you just defeated Calista.  Have you ever played against her before?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yes, I did.  We played in the Wyndham Cup.  I played against her in alternate-shot with another partner.   
 Q.  Interesting, East versus West, right?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah, uh-huh.   
 Q.  And you guys won this year?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah, we did finally, after losing four times in a row.  We came back strong.   
 Q.  So you played in a couple U.S. Girls' Juniors now.  
JENNIFER CHANG: This is my second one.   
 Q.  How does this experience rank so far for you?  
JENNIFER CHANG: I have no words because like last year I lost in the round of 32, and I lost to Yu-Sang Hou, and this year I made it to the semifinals, and that's just amazing.  I just can't imagine right now.   
 Q.  What would it mean to you today if you end up playing here tomorrow?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Wow, that's like a dream come true.  I mean, I don't know.  Like I can't even process like how I'd feel.  To make it to finals, that's just a big step compared to last year, and I think if I end up hypothetically winning it, then that would be really huge.
