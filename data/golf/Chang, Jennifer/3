 Q.  You got a range of emotions going on right now.  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah. I don't even know what to say. I mean, I thought after bogeying that last hole I was going to come close to this cut line as far as the top 20 goes.   
I saw my coach and my family and they were like, You got in. So, yeah, I'm so happy. Tears of joy.   
 Q.  Your family over there. I can see your dad is a little emotional as well. How awesome is it to have this day here at Pinehurst in your hometown?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah, it's so special. I mean, the amount of support that I have back home, it really helps. It really boosts my confidence up.   
I mean, I'm so grateful for my family and friends to be here. Yeah, I'm just -- yeah, I'm so happy.   
 Q.  It's over. Q-Series is over. Is there a little bit of a break in the future for you before what is to come?  
JENNIFER CHANG: Yeah, definitely. I'm going to finish out this semester at USC and basically come back home and work even harder and just prepare for the 2020 season.
