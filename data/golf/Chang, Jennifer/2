  Q. Jennifer, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us today.  I mean, what a great week here at Golden Ocala.  How do you feel different?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   Yeah, last week I think it was just kind of getting the rust off just because it was the first week back into the season.  So I took away way some of the things that I did not do well and kind of applied that to this week's practice.
 Worked out well.
 Q. Did you have any expectations coming into this week or goals?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   I feel like I don't set expectations or goals.  Obviously goal for anyone is to win.  Based on how I played last week I just wanted to kind of apply everything that I wanted to accomplish for the week.
 So like hitting more fairways, greens, and making more putts.
 Q. And we've got two weeks off after this.  Do you have any special plans?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   Definitely going to take a couple days off, hang out with my dog, my family, and then head out to California.  Maybe like a week before Kia just to see my coach.  Yeah.
 Q. What does it mean to start the season so strongly?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   Yeah, I mean, it means so much definitely because last year I didn't have the greatest season, and I think a lot of that came with expectations just wanting to start really strong, and so kind of learning from last year and kind of applying that to this week and the future events.
 Q. What's it been like to have such a crazy rookie year?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   Yeah, I would say first and foremost like we are very fortunate enough to keep our card this year.  You know, I think it's a blessing and a curse to have COVID, but I think it worked out really well.
 Q. And just last question:  Since you start off this season so strong do you have any goals for the rest of the season?
 JENNIFER CHANG:   Yeah, there is definitely some things that I took away from this week that I want to work on while I'm -- the two weeks off.  Short game and definitely a lot of putting.
