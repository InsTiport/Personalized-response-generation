Q. Happy with a 68 to start?  How pleasing was that?
ADRIEN SADDIER: It was really good.  I played really good from the tee, so I reached a lot of fairway and I could be aggressive from the pin.  I'm quite pleased with this round.
Q. How did you find the challenge of Ballyliffin?  Do you love the links?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Yeah, I enjoy the links golf.  It's a lot of creativity and I like playing different shots than target golf.  You play a lot of chip-and-run, something like that.
Q. How did you find the crowds?
ADRIEN SADDIER: The Irish crowds is one of the best.  I was a bit disappointed last week with the French round, and the Irish, Scottish, is one of the best crowds.
Q. Speaking to Ryan Fox earlier, he said you can be aggressive here off the tees because some of the rough is not too bad if you do stray a little bit.  Is that how you found it?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Sometimes you can have a good lie in the rough.  Different than previous weeks in Open de France and Germany.  Sometimes you can have a good lie but you have to be really safe from the tee to have a lot of fairway.
Q. There's an Open Championship place up for grabs this week.  Is that in the back of your mind after the start you've made?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Well, there's plenty of golf to play.  There's still three rounds to play.  So for the most, just focus for tomorrow and try to do the same and we'll see after.
