Q. A 68 today, and you got off to a fantastic start, 4-under through three holes?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Yeah, it was a dream start, just birdie, birdie, and just helped me to play very nice for the rest of the course.
Q. 68 is your lowest round around this golf course, as well.  What was the main key to that today?
ADRIEN SADDIER: The first key is just to take the fairway.  This year, they are soft, so I think it's easier.  But just take the fairways and it's more easier to play this course, because the rough is very terrible.  17, I hit in the rough and just have to take the wedge to go out.  Just take the fairway.
Q. Where does this golf course rate?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Just perfect.  As French, just better, so very nice.
Q. Second event in the Rolex leers, playing in your home country.  What would it mean to get a really good result here this week?
ADRIEN SADDIER: I think that the French Open is part of the Rolex Series, so it's nice for French golf and next year this is host for The Ryder Cup.  So it's just better for French golf and just a great week, too.
Q. Anything to work on ahead of tomorrow's second round?
ADRIEN SADDIER: Well, tomorrow will be different.  Just try to do the same.  Just keep the same strategy and we will see.
