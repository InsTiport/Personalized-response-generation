  ADRIEN SADDIER:   Yeah, it was a great round.   I played very well.   I made some great putts.   I started very slow.   I was 6‑under after seven.   It was very great.   I'm very happy.

Q.   So you were very positive coming into the round today? 
ADRIEN SADDIER:   Yeah, it was a great round, I'm very happy.   I'm from the Q‑School so I need to make some good results, so it's great to make 64 today.

Q.   You already have a good result, Nelson Mandela championship?
ADRIEN SADDIER:   Yeah, I finished tied six, so it was a pretty good start.   I finished 2013 very well.   So I thought that 2014, beginning well, too. 

Q.   Do you feel that the game is in good shape and that you are enjoying life on The European Tour?
ADRIEN SADDIER:   Yeah, I feel very well and I'm happy to play on this tour.

Q.   How much of a step has it been for you, because I know you haven't been professional all that long, you haven't got many tournaments that you've played?
ADRIEN SADDIER:   Yeah, just turned pro a few months ago in July, and I take my time.   Just only I am this year just to keep my card, so we will see after. 

Q.   Have you made good friends out here, people are welcoming and say, come, enjoy The European Tour? 
ADRIEN SADDIER:   The French guys are cool, the other players I don't know very well, it's coming with the time.

Q.   With this round, clearly you're right up that leaderboard now.   What do you think going into the final day? 
ADRIEN SADDIER:   If I may, if I make the same road, it's going to be good.   So just play shot by shot, try to make some good putt and we will see tomorrow.
