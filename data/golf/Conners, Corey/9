 Q. How did you feel about that round, Corey?   
COREY CONNERS: Not as completely as I was expecting it to go. Pretty disappointed. I wasn't quite on with the irons. I drove it okay. Just wasn't as good with the iron shots as I wanted it to be. The times I got out of position, I wasn't able to save myself and make that par saving putt. I had a bunch of bogeys on the front nine, which were all pretty avoidable.   
   
 Q. How are the conditions? Are you surprised by how wet it was or anything?   
COREY CONNERS: The course really dried up nice. It was in good shape. Some of the areas that were wet weren't really in play, but for the most part, it was pretty dry. The greens were definitely softer than they have been, which was expected, not quite rolling as fast as they usually are. There were some putts that you had to be a little careful with. (Inaudible). To get in there below par.   
   
 Q. How about at the start? You played like 1 1/2 holes, and then you sat for three hours?   
COREY CONNERS: It was so early in the round, we kind of treated it like a new round with kind of a warmup. Had to just make the most of it really. Didn't think it really negatively affected me. It would have been nice to keep going, but, yeah, that's the way it happened.  
   
 Q. What did you do during the break?   
COREY CONNERS: I just sat around in the caddie lounge, had second breakfast and then third breakfast and drank a few water bottles.
