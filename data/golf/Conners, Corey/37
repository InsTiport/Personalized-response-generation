Q. Tell me about today?COREY CONNERS: I had a pretty simple game plan.  These are beautiful golf courses, the Riverside Course I played today.  The goal is to get the ball on the fairway, make smart decisions in the approach shots and try to leave myself with uphill putts in a reasonable place and try to avoid making the bogeys.  After a nice start I hit the ball really, really well on the front nine and didn't miss a shot.  Putting wasn't actually particularly great on the front side, but I was just hitting the ball perfectly every shot on the fairway and was taking it close to the pin. Back nine I made a couple of birdies early on.  Stumbled with a few bogeys, but I was able to pull a couple of nice putts on 8, which is my 17th, and a nice birdie putt from just below the hole on number 9, which is my 18th hole.Q. How far was that putt?COREY CONNERS: 18, 15, 18 feet.Q. So it makes dinner taste a little better?COREY CONNERS: Absolutely.  The two putts are the same length in the last two holes, so I feel much better about the game.Q. What you accomplished last year in this championship, how has that changed your mindset as you approached this year?COREY CONNERS: I don't know.  I didn't want to try to do anything special.  You have to play good golf to get through into Match Play, and this is my goal is to just be focused and try to play my game.  Not worry about too much the first couple of days and try to get in the top 64.Q. You've played in so many different championships, and now you've played in the Canadian Open too.  How does that experience -- does that put you at ease when you start these things?COREY CONNERS: Yeah, absolutely.  Definitely learned a lot playing in the Canadian Open.  This tournament is pretty special as well.  You get treated really well and a lot of people around.  But, yeah, I've learned to kind of get in the groove and how to just try to manage my game and not let the outside factors bug me too much.Q. Last thing, you got off to a good start.  Do you put your foot on the gas pedal tomorrow or do you play a little bit conservatively?COREY CONNERS: I'm just going to do the same thing, stick to my game plan.  Try to get the ball on the fairway off the tee.  And if a nice looking approach presents itself, I'll be aggressive and try to shoot a low score.Q. What are the challenges of the Highlands Course?  You've practiced there, so what are the different chances it poses?COREY CONNERS: It's a little less forgiving.  If you're off the fairway, you have a difficult shot.  The greens are really treacherous.  So if you don't leave yourself in the right spot around the greens, you can have a pretty much impossible up-and-down and even a tough bogey or whatever.  So it will be really important to stick to do the same thing I did today and stick to my game plan and make sure I hit smart shots and leave the ball in good positions.
