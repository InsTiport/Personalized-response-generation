Q. Corey, this felt like a harder day to play golf.  You managed a really good round of golf out there.  Well played.
COREY CONNERS: Thank you.  It was definitely different than yesterday.  The wind was blowing completely different direction so made a lot more out there.  The holes that played easier could have been caught off guard today.  Did a really good job of managing my game.  Had a bonus birdie on 16 near the end, holed the bunker shot and followed up with a really good iron shot on 17.  Finished off the round really well and happy with the game.  Everything felt pretty good.
Q. This is a golf course that I would imagine to your eye looks really good, big golf course, opportunity to take advantage of your strengths.
COREY CONNERS: Definitely.  Feel like driving the golf ball and iron play is a big strength of mine.  Been putting really well lately.  Really excited about that.  If anything, I need to improve the next few days in driving a little bit better.  Didn't get it in as many fairways as I would like.  Really close, the ones I missed, and, overall, pretty solid and definitely love the golf course.
Q. You have improved your standings.  How important is it for you to maintain it for what happens if you make to it East Lake last week?
COREY CONNERS: Got myself kind of in contention or -- really going to focus on charging up the leaderboard the rest of the weekend.  Feel like my game is in great shape, so, why not go for it.
