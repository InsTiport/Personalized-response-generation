Q. First ace on the TOUR.  Saw it on TV, kind of looked like it hit the right side of the green and kicked in the hole.  What did you see from the tee?
COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, first one, pretty nice.  Really it was a good shot, it was just fighting to work its way to the left, landed just right of the pin, short of the green, and got a good bounce and started rolling towards the hole.  It was kind of coming in at an angle from our view so wasn't quite sure, but it disappeared, and I think it hit the pin with a little bit of pace, but yep, it was a really good shot.  I was kind of stretching a 9-iron for me to get it to the green there, and I hit it solid and it was enough, and it went in, so pretty fun.
Q. What was that initial feeling like when you looked up and saw it go in the hole?
COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, pretty cool.  Again, it's kind of weird.  Typically when there's a lot of people here there would have been a little bit more of a roar or cheers, but yeah, it was fun.  Felt pretty nice.
Q. Have you had any aces in non-TOUR events elsewhere?
COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, I had one on the Korn Ferry TOUR, and I think that's my eighth of my career.  Haven't had one for a few years, so nice to get back on track.
Q. Yesterday was a bogey-free round and during that stretch you went 28 holes without a bogey on this really difficult golf course.  After you made the ace, I know you hit a stretch there that was four bogeys in a row.  Did it affect you?
COREY CONNERS:   Not really.  I still felt pretty relaxed.  Still felt like I was in control of everything.  I hit kind of bad tee shots on 7, 9 and 10, and it made it difficult for me because I wasn't able to recover very well from those, but kind of got back on track and finished off the round pretty solidly.
Q. Given that you played the course really well yesterday and first part of today, do you feel like there's a round out there for you tomorrow?
COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, I think so.  I know I'm hitting my irons well and hitting a lot of good tee shots, so just give myself enough chances, I'm due to make some putts and hopefully take it low.
