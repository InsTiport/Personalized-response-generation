Q. What's your take on the last two days?
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, obviously not the scores I'd like to put up.  I wasn't overly sharp.  Things were really close, but just didn't seem to get too many breaks and couldn't get any momentum going.  I had a nice stretch, 15, 16, birdie and eagle, but with that tee shot on 17, made bogey.  Had an eagle chance on 18 but missed.  I tried to be aggressive on the front nine and the second nine we played today, and just couldn't really seem to get things going.  It was playing tricky.  The wind was picking up quite a lot.  But yeah, a little disappointed.  I feel like my game is a lot better than the scores that I've shot the last few days, but yeah, that's the way it goes.
Q. Were you aware where you were situated on the leaderboard?
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, in the last few holes, I was trying to make a birdie.  I thought 3-under would have a chance to play some more golf.  Had some chances -- actually hit some good putts on the last few holes after some decent approaches, but yeah, just couldn't seem to find it.
Q. Is there more pressure on you at this tournament, playing in Canada, friends, family?
COREY CONNERS: I don't really think so.  It was a lot of fun.  I don't usually feel as much support as I've had out here, so it feels awesome to have a bunch of people behind me and know everybody is cheering me on.  Yeah, wasn't really too -- didn't feel too much pressure, I guess.  Just tried to have as much fun as possible, and yeah, unfortunately the way I was playing wasn't overly fun, but yeah, it was a great experience.
Q. Your season as a whole, how would you describe it so far?
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, it's been kind of stuck in neutral the last little bit.  Overall it's been pretty good.  I've been in some pretty cool events and had some great experiences, just, yeah, haven't been able to close it out as well as I would have liked.  So I've got a few more events coming up, and I'll try to, yeah, get things moving in the right direction.  I feel like, as I said before, my game is really close, just not hitting some iron shots as close as I would like.  It's just a little bit off.  So if I can get that dialed in, I think I'll be able to finish it strong.
Q. You put yourself in kind of a precarious situation right around the 125 number.  Is that something that grates on you?
COREY CONNERS: Well, not at the moment, but I'm sure it'll start to.  Time is running low.  You can't really hide from it, I guess.  I'm going to have to have a good week one of the next few.  Yeah, I kind of expected myself after the way I started the year and midway through the season to be a little higher in the FedExCup standings, but yeah, it is what it is, and hopefully I'll battle hard the next few events and see what happens.
Q. Any idea why you're stuck in neutral?
COREY CONNERS: Not really sure.  I seem to be driving the ball well and putting it well and not seeing a lot of putts go in, but I'm hitting good putts, and some iron shots are just a little bit off, and it's making things tough.  I've short-sided myself way too many times.  Yeah, just need to sharpen it up a little bit.  Things can change pretty quickly.  I was just kind of hoping they would change this week.  I had a similar type of game to last week, so yeah, was just trying to get things going here, but it didn't happen.
Q. Schedule the way the rest?
COREY CONNERS: I'm going to play in Reno next week, the Barracuda, have a week off, and then Wyndham Championship.  Two more events left, and yeah, get myself into the Playoffs and see how far we can go.
