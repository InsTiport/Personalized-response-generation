Q. I did have one question. What are your thoughts on Sungjae's swing? All the guys have been talking about how good he is and his swing and everything.
COREY CONNERS: I played with him last week the first two days, and I played with him before this season. He really flushes it. He's got a really great game. I think the first time you play with him, you maybe start your walk a bit early. He swings pretty slowly on the way back. Usually, you kind of have it timed where you -- they start taking it back, and you can get ready to start moving, but you've got to hold your position a little bit more.
Awesome guy. He's a lot of fun. We had a good conversation out there. It was a great game.
