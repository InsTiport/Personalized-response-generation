  Q. 2-over 74 here in the final round.  How would you describe the challenge that was Bay Hill here today?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, it was a challenge.  Definitely a battle out there.  I made some nice saves at the start of the round, just didn't get the putts to fall today, the greens were rolling really fast, ball seemed to never stop.  So it was very challenging, gave myself a shot, made a really great eagle on 16 that felt pretty good and bogeyed the last two holes wasn't great, but really challenging golf holes.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one.
 Q. When you made the eagle on 16 how aware were you of where you stood at that point?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, I knew it got me within striking distance.  I didn't really look at the boards too much through out the day, I just wanted to stick to my game plan and knew that you couldn't really force anything out there, because that's where you get your self into trouble.  But I knew at that point that I was pretty close and tried to give myself a good chance on that last couple.
 Q. Had a chance to save par at 17.  What did you see to know that par putt?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, it was a really good putt, it lacked a little bit of speed.  The greens were rolling really fast, so I didn't want to get too aggressive with it.  I gave myself a little extra break and it just snapped right across the hole.  Felt like I hit a pretty good putt, it was a really nice bunker shot to give myself a chance, yeah, it just kind of ran out of speed and just dove right across the hole and wasn't able to drop.
 Q. What do you take away from this week?
 COREY CONNERS:   A lot of positive things.  I struck the ball really well, I was really patient, I felt confident about my game, so really excited where things are at heading into next week.
