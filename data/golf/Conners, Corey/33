 Q.  Describe your feelings all day long.  It had to be a lot of fun but also kind of crazy with all that was going on in front of you.  
 Can you describe what was going on?   
COREY CONNERS: It was really cool.  Came out and tried to have as much fun as possible.  I kind of knew what to expect out there with a lot of people and lot of people watching but I felt comfortable; tried to get relaxed as early as possible and fortunately got off to a good start and kind of settled me down nicely.  Kept things pretty solid throughout the round.   
 Q.  On Friday you had the double bogey and then you bounced back with a brilliant shot at 7 and today you had back-to-back bogies and you bounced back with three birdies over the next six holes.  You really know how to settle things down, didn't you?  
COREY CONNERS: Don't get too worried.  I know bogies are going to happen, especially on this golf course being so difficult.  Yeah, just block off the hole and try to figure a way to tackle the next and give myself the next chance for birdie.  It's really nice to be able to bounce back the times I have and hopefully I can get back on.   
 Q.  What about tomorrow now, final group playing with Justin Rose, Tiger and Sneds right behind you, you have a chance to go wire to wire.  That would be pretty neat.  
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, it would.  I was trying to stick to my game plan, play my game and it will be another fun day out there.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.   
 Q.  The putting, I got to ask you about that because the putter has been really, really spot on.  
COREY CONNERS: Yeah.  These greens when I first showed up here I really liked the look of the greens and see my lines really well and my speed has been excellent, even really long putts, and lot of putts have quite a bit of breaks from out here and need to get speeds to be able to hold them.  Really good speed.  Helped me a lot.   
 Q.  For the third straight round here at Innisbrook a day in the 60s.  How would you describe your performance here on Saturday?  
COREY CONNERS: Obviously really happy with my round today.  I got off to a nice start and got settled in well.  A few mistakes but bounced back with some birdies and, yeah, really happy with how things went.   
 Q.  When we talked yesterday you talked about sticking to your game plan here on the weekend.  How do you feel you did that over the course of 18 holes?  
COREY CONNERS: I feel like I did that really well.  I was really patient out there, tried to get the ball in the fairway off the tee and hit a lot of good tee balls and picked my shots to be aggressive at some pins and just make sure I hit it on the fat side of some of the greens and the pin was in a tricky spot and executed a lot of nice golf shots and made some putts.   
 Q.  What were the emotions like being in the final pairing and the guy everybody was trying to catch?  
COREY CONNERS: It's really cool.  Fun position to be in.  Kind of what I work for and everybody works for out here.  Really exciting.  Felt pretty relaxed out there.  I think tomorrow will be another fun day.  Looking forward it.   
 Q.  To go back to your Kent State days, you said your favorite golfer was Tiger Woods and, in fact, he was part of your dream foursome.  He's going to be in a pairing behind you with a host of other world class players chasing you.  
 What is that reality sinking in now that you got a chance to win and you've got to hold off your favorite golfer and a host of others?   
COREY CONNERS: It's really cool.  I was smiling a lot out there, you could hear some roars.  I figure it will be similar tomorrow.  I'm sure -- kind of knew what was going on without even having to see it.  But it will be cool.  It's fun seeing him out there today and I'm sure he'll be battling hard tomorrow but hopefully I can play my game and have a good day.
