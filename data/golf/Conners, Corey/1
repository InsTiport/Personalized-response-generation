Q. Talk about your play today. Are you satisfied with how things turned out? 
COREY CONNERS: Yeah. Obviously, I was pretty happy to come back this morning and make a couple birdies to finish off my second round. Yeah, I felt like I had some positive momentum going, played really well that second round. I was close out there, didn't get putts to fall. 
Yeah, overall, fairly pleased. Kind of disappointing to finish like I did, but it was pretty close. Try to go have a low one tomorrow.

Q. What is your confidence level now out on the golf course? 
COREY CONNERS: The second round gave me a lot of confidence, knowing that the course is scorable, knowing that if I stick to the game plan, I could get a good score. Definitely boosted my confidence and comfort level out here. A little disappointed I didn't have a lower one in the third round today, but it's all good.

Q. What do you do tomorrow? What's the goal? 
COREY CONNERS: Another low round really. Don't want to try and force things, but try and make sure I play the par5s well. Yeah, shoot a low number.

Q. Got an eye on the top spot? 
COREY CONNERS: I don't know. We'll see. Just try and play my game and see what happens.

Q. On the positive side, Corey, your second round is the lowest score of the day. Are you aware of what's done with the lowest score? 
COREY CONNERS: No.

Q. A crystal vase. 
COREY CONNERS: Nice, yeah. I had an eagle in round 1 as well. So I got some crystal last year playing. I'll get some more.

Q. Are you also aware that's the lowest round ever shot by a Canadian? 
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, pretty big honor. There's obviously been some great Canadians to have played here. Yeah, it was a fun round. Hopefully can recreate some of that tomorrow or in the years to come.

Q. When you're signing a 65 card here at Augusta, how proud are you of yourself? 
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, it's a really great round. With the current conditions, it's scorable if you hit good shots, but any mistakes that you make out here, you get yourself into trouble pretty easily. So it's a really solid round. Yeah, definitely one of my better rounds of my career probably.

Q. Back five years ago, first round 80. Do you remember when you got the invitation, maybe by the mail, what was your reaction? 
COREY CONNERS: I was really excited. Dream come true as an amateur golfer to play in the Masters. Watching Mike win in 2003 really kind of boosted my love of golf and my motivation to try and make a career of golf, and to get to play as an amateur was pretty amazing.

Q. Do you remember your first round here? Maybe your practice round the week before the tournament? 
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, I was able toââ I came kind of the end of the year prior to April. I think around the end of 2014, I was able to play. I was just in awe with how beautiful the place was. Just felt really special walking around. It's hard to describe. Magical feeling.

Q. When you're out there playing, how difficult is the balance to try and be aggressive with the caution that's demanded on this course? 
COREY CONNERS: You just have to be smart. Always got to be swinging aggressively, even if you're playing away from the hole. There's definitely a fine balance there. You've got to pick your spots. I felt comfortable over some shots today and tried to go after it and felt not as comfortable over some others and knew I just had to be a little on the conservative side.

Q. (Inaudible)? 
COREY CONNERS: I don't know. We'll see. I can't think about that right now.
