  Q. Back-to-back rounds in the 60s, how would you compare today's performance with what you did on day one?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, it was really solid today.  I didn't hit as many shots close to the hole as I did yesterday, to give myself as many birdie chances, but I was really happy with how I grinded out a bunch of pars today.  I was in some tricky spots and, yeah, overall really solid day and nice to finish off with a strong back nine.
 Q. How, if at all, is this golf course changing maybe through the week that you've seen?
 COREY CONNERS:   It's definitely crisping up a little bit.  Some of the greens are getting a little firmer and I expect that to continue.  May get some rain tomorrow, but it was getting a little crispy out there coming in the last few holes, so it's definitely firmed up a lot.  But it's in amazing shape so it's great to be out here.
 Q. You talked about the potential of rain on Saturday, how will that potentially impact your plan and outlook of getting around here?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, I mean, still trying to focus on the same stuff, try and keep it simple, try and stick to my game plan.  If there's weather, if it rains, I'll deal with it as it comes.  I haven't really looked too hard at the forecast, but, yeah, we'll just see what happens and ready for anything.
 Q. Where is your comfort level in this position halfway through a golf tournament, maybe relative to two or three years ago?
 COREY CONNERS:   Yeah, way more comfortable.  I haven't really been in this position a lot, but I have a lot of confidence in my game and feeling really relaxed the last few days, so try and keep that going.  I feel like I have a lot of energy, I had an off week last week and really excited for the weekend.
