 Q.  Corey, tied for 10th right now after 36 holes. You've put yourself in a pretty good position going into the weekend. How would you assess your performance today?  
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, it was good. A lot of good stuff happened out there. Putted pretty nicely the last few days. Unfortunately made a couple bogeys coming in. I'm happy with where I'm at. I played pretty nicely again today. I've been putting quite well the last few days. Yeah, pretty happy about that.   
A lot of nice stuff happening, and feel good about things going into the weekend.   
 Q.  Could you talk about the reaction you got from the fans to the right of No. 15 when you hit your approach to five feet?  
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, it was pretty cool. I mean, they're set up in someone's yard. Yeah, it certainly made you feel good. I know we're used to getting applause and whatnot and cheers when we hit good shots, so yeah, that felt nice. It was definitely different because that's not happening really anywhere else on the golf course, so it put a smile on my face for sure.   
 Q.  Overall after 36 holes are you starting to feel a little more normal after the long layoff?  
COREY CONNERS: Yeah, definitely. I felt pretty comfortable as I got into the round yesterday and got off to a great start again today. Yeah, just obviously haven't competed for a while, but I'm feeling very comfortable and excited for the next few days.
