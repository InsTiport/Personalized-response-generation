 Q.  Kind of colorful scorecard, right?  All over the place.  
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  Just tell me what was happening.  
CAROLINE INGLIS: It was a little bit of a hot mess during the middle of the round, yeah.  I made like a couple bogeys on the -- like earlier in the front, and just told myself, Okay, let's get them back.   
Then I birdied 9 and 10, which was great, and then just had a really bad hole on 11.   
Bogeyed 12 as well.   
Me and my caddie were like, All right.  There are lots of birdies opportunities coming up.  I knew the tees were up on 15, so just tried to do my best.   
And then dunked it on 17, which was really fun.   
 Q.  Yeah.  So it was a straight dunk?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: No.  It was like one bounce and then it like trickled in.   
 Q.  What did you hit there?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: I hit a 4-hybrid.   
 Q.  Distance?  Do you have any idea?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: I think it was 180.   
 Q.  Okay.  
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  Cool.  Is this the kind of week you've been waiting for for a while would you say?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah.  I mean, think I've been playing pretty solid this year.  It's a matter of just putting it all together.   
And it's not even close to over yet.  I just want to go out and do my best on every shot tomorrow and see what happens.   
 Q.  Do you get nervous at all being in this position?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: I think if you didn't get nervous you would be crazy.   
Yeah, no.  I mean, today, no, but I'm sure tomorrow on the first tee there will be nerves.  But it's natural.   
 Q.  Do you like this course?  
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah.  I really, really like this course.  It kind of reminds me of a mix of like Oregon where I'm from and kind of the Australian course we played earlier in the year.   
Yeah, I love it course.  I like the greens.  The poana greens are what I'm used to playing on, so that's nice.   
You definitely have to think your way around, which I like in a golf course.   
 Q.  What do you think is the best part of your game right now?  Tough question.  
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I think just -- sometimes it's like hasn't been pretty this week, but just like getting it in the hole.  Just been kind of grinding it out and just so scoring, scrambling.
