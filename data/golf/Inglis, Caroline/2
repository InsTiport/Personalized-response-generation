Q. Caroline Inglis, hometown Oregonian back here at Columbia Edgewater Golf Course, your home course.  How special is it to be here playing in this event?
CAROLINE INGLIS: Yeah, it's really awesome.  It's weird seeing all the grandstands and everything; it's just different.
But it feels great to be able to be at home this week and sleep in my own bed and play a course that I know for once and feel comfortable on.
So it's really awesome.
Q. Does it feel a little different as you're here playing a tournament and not playing for fun?
CAROLINE INGLIS: It does.  Feels a little different.  I think I just need to keep reminding myself that it's a tournament and just go through the week like I do any other tournament and do the normal practice routines and just focus.
Q. You had conditional status last year.  With your second year out here on the LPGA Tour, how has your experience been so far?
CAROLINE INGLIS: It's been awesome.  I mean, I've had a really good year.  I think I feel a lot more comfortable out here this year.  I got into a rhythm of what I was doing and I just feel like I belong and feel more confident.
I absolutely love it.  I love competing and traveling to all these new places, so it's been awesome.
Q. Last week at CP Women's Open we saw Brooke Henderson take home the national championship.  Should we expect you to bring some of that magic here?
CAROLINE INGLIS: I sure hope so.  That would be pretty awesome.  Yeah, I'm just going to do my best.  Sounds cliche, but, you know, one shot at a time and just stay present.
That's the goal, is to win.  Yeah, that would be awesome.
Q. Good luck this week.
CAROLINE INGLIS: Thank you.
