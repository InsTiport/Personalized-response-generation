 Q.   Thanks a lot.   St. John's guy storming up the leaderboard today after a nice round, 64, 31 on the closing 9.   That is with the bogey on 18.   
Are you satisfied with today?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I played really well today.   Drove the ball great and got hot with the putter.   So it was a nice feeling.  
   
 Q.   Something about North Carolina and the golf course that you like?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I won in Charlotte last year.   I shot 12-under over on River Run.   This course actually reminds me a lot of it.   Green styles are very much the same, the bermuda grass and just enjoy playing this style of course.  
   
 Q.   One off the lead heading into the weekend.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I'm in a good position.   Hopefully I'll go out and I think going to have to make some birdies out here.   The course is soft.   So, hopefully I'll be making a bunch of putts the next two days.  
   
 Q.   Appreciate your time.   Good luck.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   How was it today?   Tell me.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I'm hitting a lot of fairways and hitting my irons nicely and rolling the putter great and I played really well today.   I made a lot of putts and kept the ball in the fairway so at anytime have to get up and down.   So hopefully that continues.  
   
 Q.   What do you think the keys are going into tomorrow?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   Keeping it in the fairway, hitting lot of good approach shots.   You can -- it's tough to play out of the bermuda rough out on this course.   If you're in the fairway you can attack the pins and always helps to make a bunch of putts.
