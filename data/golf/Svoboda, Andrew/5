 Q.   First round of 5-under par, 65.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I played great today.   Got off to a really hot start, made 5 in a row there on 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.   So making the turn and, unfortunately, I had a double on 14 there but I made two birdies coming in so I'm really happy with my 5-under.  
   
 Q.   Talk to us about, I find this course so intriguing.   Your thoughts on this Sedgefield Country Club.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   It's a great track.   Got to drive it in the fairway.   The greens are really firm and very fast, fastest bermuda I've ever played and the course is in great shape, really good layout.  
   
 Q.   Now, it's an important week for lots of people with a FedExCup Playoffs looming.   You're consistently sitting at 209th.   
What's your strategy for going into Friday and the weekend?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I got to play as aggressive as I can and try to finish as high as I possibly can in this event and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   You're off to a fantastic start.   Keep it up, man.  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Andrew, 5-under out there today.   Nice bounce back after the double-bogey.   What's going on?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   I was hitting all my lines and making all my putts.   It was really fun.  
   
 Q.   How does this round feel by your win on the Web.com Tour?  
ANDREW SVOBODA:   It definitely took a lot of pressure off me knowing I'll have status.   Good chance of making the Tour next year.   Definitely freed me up to play the way I did today.
