CHRIS RILEY:  I played okay, but Padraig made two eagles on Par 5's and that was the difference. I was pretty solid but I just need to make a few more putts in the afternoon than I did in the morning. That should make it interesting.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's going to be a long, long day. It's been a tough battle already and I can see this going all the way. He has not given away anything and I think I'm going to have to be more aggressive with my iron play and see how things go this afternoon."
