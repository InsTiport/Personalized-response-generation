 Q. 4-under today, 66, tell me about the day and how it worked out for you. 
 CHRIS RILEY: I started off real good, I had three birdies early and I really just made pars after that.
 But I've been struggling, so 66 is good. 

 Q. Tell me about the birdies. 
 CHRIS RILEY: I hit it real close on 2, a 5-iron to about 2 and a half, three feet, and then on 4 I hit it in there about 6 feet and then on 5 I hit an 8-iron to about 6 feet. So I was 3-under early and then made one birdie coming in. 

 Q. Has that what's been lacking this year? 
 CHRIS RILEY: This year, the last five years I haven't putted like I used to, and I know I'm capable of, and it's frustrating, and I don't know if it's with age or what, but I putt like a normal TOUR player now instead of, like, an unconscious TOUR player like I used to. 

 Q. How has that been for you? 
 CHRIS RILEY: Confusing. You know you can do something, and then you're searching and -- it really comes down to mental now. It's in there somewhere but you got to get it out. 

 Q. Just keep practicing it? 
 CHRIS RILEY: Keep doing, believing, keep making putts, keep trying.

 Q. Are you switching putters at all or --
 CHRIS RILEY: I just went back to the putter I used in the Ryder Cup, and I'm either going to go down with it or I'm going to go back up. 

 Q. Really? 
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah.

 Q. So you've made the changes you can --
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah, the fat, slim grip, the crazy putter, I haven't tried the belly or the long. I'll be 38 this year and I just can't do it. 

 Q. Yeah. 
 CHRIS RILEY: It is what it is, I'm just trying to have fun.

 Q. How is the golf course? 
 CHRIS RILEY: Awesome. I really like this course because it doesn't favor the bombers, because there are two par 5s, and I can get to one of 'em -- actually I can get to both of 'em. So it's a pretty even playing field. 

 Q. And that makes it better? 
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah, for me.
