 Q. Talk about how tough this course is playing. When you only have 24 putts you have to be very pleased. 
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah, I putted really good today. I mean, I putted a little better, but I putted really good the last few days actually. This is one of the good tournaments out here, the Tiger Woods Foundation, and it's one of them on my list.

 Q. Talk about how it played out there today. 
 CHRIS RILEY: If the greens got any faster they would be kind of unplayable, but they've done a great job with the speed of the greens. It's playable. I mean, I shot 4-under. 

 Q. Is it mostly just a test of patience? 
 CHRIS RILEY: I haven't been in this position in a lock time, but yeah, I'm sure it is, just slow everything down and have fun, then go out in one of the last groups and be uncomfortable out there (laughing). 

 Q. How have you been playing coming in here?
 CHRIS RILEY: I've been playing okay. I shot a couple low rounds at Memorial and then missed the cut last week, and then this week it's coming around. I'm having fun playing, and like I said, everybody actually back home wanted me to try for the U.S. Open, and I said, I've got one in two weeks at Aronimink. This is where I'm at. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 CHRIS RILEY: I've been changing clubs the last couple years, and I've putted with the same putter for eight years and then I put it away for two years and then I brought it back out. My putter has made putts before, so I'm still teaching it.
