  Q. Chris, good round today, but almost kind of a little too little too late kind of?  
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah. I mean I was definitely 8 or 9-under out there today. I played that well. And a couple putts here and there. But I knew I had to shoot really low today.   
 But obviously I'm a little disappointed knowing I didn't finish in the Top 125, but I came down here and tried my butt off, and it just didn't work out.  
 But you know, there's going to be some other guys feeling like I am tonight, but you know, it's so competitive out here, it's a chore to get in that 125.   
  
  Q. You go to final stage next. You haven't missed a cut in like three months, or maybe four months, since like mid July. Do you take that little bit of confidence going into that?  
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah. You know what, I was talking to my caddie about that. I really finished golf tournaments off poorly this year. That's the reason why I am where I'm at. I've had a couple of opportunities really to not even worry about 125.   
 But I'm getting older and I'm starting to think about it coming down to the end, so nerves were starting to play. When I was in my 20s, I didn't even think about it.   
 But I'm definitely playing well. I haven't missed a cut since Tiger invited me to his tournament. But unfortunately it's not about missing cuts out here. It's about finishing high and top finishes, but I'm actually going to drive down to Bear Lake tonight and get some practice rounds in, because I live all the way out in San Diego, so I'm going to be working the course tomorrow morning.
