Q.
You guys seemed to really be doing well today?

TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, we got it going today.  We made a few birdies early, which the Europeans made a couple of mistakes which gave us a little bit of an edge.  From there we just played real solid golf.
Q.  It's one thing to want to go do it and it's quite another thing actually getting out there and doing it, how much pressure did you feel today?

TIGER WOODS:  We had no choice.  We had to.  We had to at least get a 3-1, especially this morning, to have a chance going into the afternoon to at least get some positive momentum going.

You know, right now we're looking pretty good.  We've still got to go out there and get the job done somehow coming in.  The European Team is a tough team and they are playing well and hopefully our guys back there can get it done.
Q.  Chris, what a partnership?
CHRIS RILEY:  Yeah, we've known each other a long time and when I saw my pairing this morning, it was just, what a partner.  What can you say when Tiger Woods is your partner, you ain't thinking bad, that's for sure.  It was exciting and we did well.

There's still a lot of golf left and we are going to go cheer our guys on and hopefully bring them home.
Q.  So do you like the Ryder Cup?
CHRIS RILEY:  Love the Ryder Cup.  I don't like it, I love it.
