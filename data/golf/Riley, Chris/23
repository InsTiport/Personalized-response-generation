Q.  You birdied all the par 5s today?
CHRIS RILEY:  Usually I struggle on those because my length isn't my strong point.  That's usually where I get beat is on the par 5s, and today I made four birdies on them.
Q.  Do you think that's the key on this golf course, that you have to get the par 5s?
CHRIS RILEY:  The key I think here is putting the ball in the fairway.  It doesn't really matter the length out here.  I played with a long hitter today, Henrik, and he had to hit a lot of 3 woods.

I was driving it well.  Length is not a big factor out here.  I mean, it always helps, but putting the ball in the fairway is the big thing.
Q.  Are you surprised at this course?
CHRIS RILEY:  Yeah, I am.  I don't know what's low, but I thought 6 under would have been in the Top 5.  I don't know what place it's in, but I'm happy with it.
Q.  What was the key for your round?
CHRIS RILEY:  Really the first hole.  I missed an 8 iron right of the green on the par 5, the 10th, and holed it out for birdie, and that really got me going.  I think I made seven birdies.
Q.  Can you talk about your play recently and how you felt coming into the event?
CHRIS RILEY:  I felt really good coming into the event.  Over the last year I haven't been playing good, but over the last two months I've really been playing good and getting no result.  I'm feeling really comfortable out there.  I've had a couple Top 5s in these tournaments before, so I've been there.  I think I can handle it.
Q.  It seemed like most of the low scores came this morning.  I can't ask you if you played tougher because you didn't have the early experience, but do you sense the wind picking up?
CHRIS RILEY:  Not really.  I didn't think it played tremendously hard.  The greens were soft and they were still in great shape.  No, I don't think there was an advantage either way.
