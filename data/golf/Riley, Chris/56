CHRIS RILEY:   Thanks. 
 

Q.  66, six under par.
 
CHRIS RILEY:   I was just playing solid, I was three under 215 and birdied the last three.  I made a real good birdie on 18, hit it in the right trees and hooked one around to about 15 feet and made it.  So it was a nice capper.  
 

Q.  Well, any questions?  Chris, what did you do, make putts?
 
CHRIS RILEY:   Birdied the last three. 
 

Q.  Why don't you just go over your card  for us real quick then.
 
CHRIS RILEY:   The last three? 
 

Q.  Yeah.
 
CHRIS RILEY:   Well, 16 is a par 5.  It's reachable in  two.  I hit driver, 5-wood just short, chipped in from about two feet and made it.  Then 17 is playing straight down wind, 200 yards.  I hit 7-iron, about 25 feet, made that and then on 18 I hit it in the right trees, snap-hooked a 7-iron to about 12 feet and lipped it in.  
 

Q.  Lipped in?
 
CHRIS RILEY:   Yeah.  That was fun today.  Thanks.  
 

Q.  How have you been playing this year?
 
CHRIS RILEY:   I've been playing okay.  I mean I think I'm like somewhere in the high teens on the money list.  I just haven't had a good one yet, but I've been playing consistent.  I mean I think I have three top 20s.  So I'm just looking for that big one, you know, those ones you gotta -- for a guy like me who's not a superstar, I'm looking for those couple top 5s that you have to have out here or else you're down the road.  I mean that's just the way it is, I think.  I don't know.  But hopefully I'll just get into contention and see what happens.  But I'm feeling good about my game, so... 
 

Q.  What do you feel good about? 
 
CHRIS RILEY:   I feel good about everything.  I'm driving it good.  I'm hitting my irons good.  The only thing I'm a little shaky on is my putting.  I just -- I know it's there.  I just gotta go work it out, so... 
 

Q.  It's been there for you in the past.  It's not like you're a bad putter.
 
CHRIS RILEY:   No.  I'm usually a pretty good putter.  I think that's why I stay out here, I mean, really, my putting.  So yeah.  
 

Q.  What have you done here in the past?
 
CHRIS RILEY:   This is my third one and I've made the cut and finished 55th every year, I think.  So I'm looking to improve on that.
