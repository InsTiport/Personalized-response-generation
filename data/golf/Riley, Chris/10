  Q. Round 3 finally done. You're obviously in great position. How are you feeling, how is your game?  
 CHRIS RILEY: I feel good. I'm putting it really nice and, you know, 15-under, I think I'm tied so, I'm real excited about this afternoon. It's a great opportunity for me.  
  
  Q. How is the course playing, playing long?  
 CHRIS RILEY: Yeah, it is playing longer. Yeah. Still a lot of golf left out there. I just hope I have a shot with 9 holes to go.
