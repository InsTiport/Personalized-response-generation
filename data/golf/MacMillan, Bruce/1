 Q.   Just sort of what your week's been like.   I don't know when you sort of stepped into this role, I don't think you anticipated this happening.   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   No, not at all.   It's been unbelievable.  
   
 Q.   You get a little choked up?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did you know you were getting‑‑ how did this process work?   Only a couple girls use local caddies.   Did you know right away it was going to be Lydia?  
BRUCE MACMILLAN:   I volunteer to caddie sometimes.   A good friend of mine is the caddie master, and I asked him if he would be so kind as to get me a good bag.  
   
 Q.   Wow, he picked it?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Well, Tina has some parameters, and somehow I slipped into those parameters.  
   
 Q.   For the press watching her, she's for her age so unruffled.   But the broadcaster said you were a bit of a calming influence.   Who was calming who out there?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   You know, Lydia on her birth certificate, she's 16.   That is the only difference.  
   
 Q.   What about her game that's impressed you, just on the course?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   In golf so many times you hear that every swing should look the same.   In my life I've never seen anything better.  
   
 Q.   We are looking at something special, looking at the future?   Are you choked up again?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   You followed her, for sure, I think you know the answer.  
   
 Q.   Is this going to change your golf game?   I mean, you know this course better than most.   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   I am wiser now.   I got an unbelievable education.   I have no aspirations to be‑‑  
   
 Q.   No, but there's got to be some takeaway just spending that much time with that caliber?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Oh, it's great.   The other thing that touched my heart‑‑ the mother‑daughter relationship, unparalleled.  
   
 Q.   Oh, you made a connection.   I'm sure you might even stay in touch with her now.   You'll certainly follow her.   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Maybe.   If she would consider it, I would love it.  
   
 Q.   Was there any moment through today that you just thought, wow, this kid's got this in the bag or were you as nervous as she was today?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   She always has a calm about her.   I think that's probably one of her greatest assets.  
   
 Q.   How on earth do you go back to your day job now?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   I don't have one.   (Indiscernible).  
   
 Q.   So will you stay on the course tomorrow?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   No, I get on a plane and go home tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Where's home?   I thought this was home?  
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   I lived here all of my life until three years ago.  
   
 Q.   So where is home for you?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Victoria.  
   
 Q.   So you flew in just to do this?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Absolutely.   
   
 Q.   Did you know there were only two of you that weren't traveling caddies?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   I believe 15 caddies were placed.   
   
 Q.   How long have you been a member here?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Over 20 years.  
   
 Q.   Are you still?   
BRUCE MacMILLAN:   Yep.
