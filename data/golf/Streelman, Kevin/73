   On being in the field at THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time.  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: It's a huge dream come true for me. This is the best field of the year and to be a part of that and to feel like I belong is really neat. I spent a lot of years on the mini-tours and there were a lot of times where I wasn't sure if I would make it year, so that makes it special. To get here once is one thing, to stay in this field moving forward is another. It just inspires me to work that much harder.  
 On the closing holes and 17 in particular.  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: The first thing that stood out to me is the green is much larger that it looks on television. The hard part is wind gusts. I noticed they don't put flags on top of the grandstands and I imagine that's on purpose. I think the finish is great because you can make eagle on 16 or you can make a really big number. With 17, it's known as a hole where you just hit the middle of the green and get out with a par, but if you want to step up and hit a really good nine-iron you can make birdie. It's fun in that regard and different from a finish where you feel like you are holding on and just trying to make pars. It's an opportunity for exciting things to happen and that's what fans want to see.
