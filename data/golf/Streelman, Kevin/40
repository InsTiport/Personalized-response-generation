Q.   All right.   Little better day today.   What was going well for you?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Hit it great today.   Made a couple nice putts early.   Couldn't get anything on the back there, 9 pars but really out here, that's never going to hurt you too bad.   So, it's the same first two rounds I shot last year.   Feeling good going into the weekend.

Q.   What's the difference between the last two years?   Have you noticed anything outside of the weather and the conditions?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Obviously yesterday was extremely difficult conditions, especially early when we played, but today is looking good and the greens held up really nicely today and great weather this week.

Q.   What's it's been like going around the course the last two days?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   It's really fun.   People say, "Hey Champ" or "Defending Champ".   The support is awesome.   Remembering some of the shots I had on the back-9 on Sunday is fun.   Always hold a dear place in my heart.
