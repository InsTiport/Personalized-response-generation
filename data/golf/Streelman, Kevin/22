 Q.  (No microphone.)  
KEVIN STREELMAN: I hit it great.  I was a little disappointed in that round because I felt like I had eight to 10 feet on almost every hole.  But hitting it great.   
 Q.  It looked long but everyone ends up playing from the same spot.  That's not the case here, you can hit driver?  
KEVIN STREELMAN: It's always suited my eye well since 2008, my rookie year out here.  I had a few good weeks out here and excited to get back to the South Course.  I feel comfortable out there.  See what we can do this week.   
 Q.  What's the difference in the two nines today?  
KEVIN STREELMAN: To be honest I could have been a few under on the front.  I hit it great.  I was eight to 10 feet all day and just didn't make a ton of putts.  But hit a lot of good putts.   
You just got to be really patient on these greens, they can move around a lot, they got a lot of break and sometimes you don't see it.  Just stayed patient.  It's going to be a fun weekend.   
 Q.  Are you happy with where you are going into the weekend?  
KEVIN STREELMAN: Haven't really looked exactly where I am or how many back, but I did my best on each shot and felt really good about things and I'm hitting it great.  So if I keep doing that and make a few putts I think I can get in contention this week.
