 Q.   First off, can you talk about the eagle that you had on 4?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   It's such a great par‑5 because you have got to position your tee ball and your second shot to get a birdie.   
Hit a great drive down the right side, which I knew I needed to, and then hit a great 3‑wood to the left side, which I knew I needed to because the pin was really just tucked in the back right corner.   Pretty much had a straight look right up the gut.   It was one of those that was tough to make, but had a good line on it and buried about a 60‑, 70‑footer there.   
   
 Q.   Wow, okay.   So you hit 3‑wood and made the long putt, okay.   That got the round going and you finished with an even par.   Can you talk about how that helped you?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yeah, this is one of my favorite courses I have ever seen, to be honest.   I feel really comfortable this week.   I was very disappointed with the double I had, but just bad lay‑up really on the par‑5 from the other side, the back side.   But besides that, I played beautifully.   I feel really confident.   
Just go out and attack tomorrow if the greens aren't too bad at 2:00p.m. in the afternoon.   Play smart golf and just try to get in position for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Did that help this morning having a little bit of rain overnight and then getting out there early?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Probably.   You know, there wasn't much wind and now there's not much wind, to be honest.   This is a beautiful day.   The greens were nice.   The greens were receptive, as well.   It always helps for us if you have pins that are reasonably accessible, you can attack them.
