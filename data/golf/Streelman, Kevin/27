Q.   Well played today. 
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Thank you.

Q.   How did you find it out there?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   It was challenging today.   The wind was obviously a little stiffer than it was yesterday and it just kept moving around on us this afternoon.   So, it was tricky. 
But struck the ball really well, made some nice saves coming in and really proud of that round.

Q.   How did you find the greens?   Soft?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   No, I thought they were about right.   If they were too firm it would have been a little out of control, I think, out there.   So you hit a good shot it will stop, but if not, it's going to run for a while and I think it's playing really well right now.

Q.   Can you talk me through your birdies of the day?   How about 15?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   15, hit a decent drive, but didn't quite catch it.   With the wind swirling, I just didn't feel comfortable hitting the hybrid into that green.   So I laid up to a good number.   Had 82 yards.   Hit a pretty sweet lob wedge in there and almost holed it for an eagle.   Had a tap‑in birdie.
Had one at 13 as well.   Hit a nice 3‑iron around the corner to about 20 feet, just missed that putt coming down the hill. 
Besides that, I just kind of did what you're supposed to do out here.

Q.   What are you going to do this afternoon?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I'm going to get my daughter at day care and hang out with her and, yeah, just have dinner with some friends.   Pretty low key. 

Q.   No practice?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I might just do a quick warm down, but not much.
