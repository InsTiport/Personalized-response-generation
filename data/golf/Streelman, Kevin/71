  Q. Kevin, 5-under par, 65. Pretty good front side for you. It all happened on the first nine holes.  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: I really got it going today. I hit it great today. Made some more putts on the front. Hit a couple more fairways. I missed a couple fairways on the back which really hurt you on this golf course.  
  
  Q. Tell the us about the golf course conditions because it was kind of soft to begin with and it got a little bit more rain. How did the course play for you?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: The course is holding up great. The fairways are running firm. The greens are pretty soft with the bent grass and this much heat and humidity, they need to keep a lot of water on them. We were able to fire at most of the pins and results in good scoring.  
  
  Q. Now you're finished and it may be awhile before you get to either at least finish that second round. What's your mindset knowing that we have some weather setting in?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: It's -- can't do anything about it. Just kind of go relax, watch a movie, hang out with the wife. My sister doesn't live too far from here. They're coming in with their family.  
  
  Q. Playing well head into the playoffs can't hurt. You're already in the PGA TOUR playoffs, probably deep enough to get into a couple events.   
 What are your thoughts looking ahead to the playoffs?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Get in the third one. I did it last year. This year Cog Hill where I grew up, grew up on the golf course. It would really mean a lot to me to play in front of all my friends and family. I was shooting for that.  
  
  Q. Good stuff there despite your caddy. Good luck the rest of the way.  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Thank you.
