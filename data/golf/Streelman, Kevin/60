 Q.   From what I understand, someone putted before you, maybe you got the line on it and then that enabled you to make the putt?   Tell me what happened.   
KEVIN STREELMAN:   There were two groups on the last hole, so we teed up, instead of waking all the he way back to the tee, we waited near the green and watched them come in.   But Bo Van Pelt actually hit it right where mine ended up.   
It would have been nice to see his, but I didn't.   I knew it was really fast down that hill and just didn't hit it hard enough and left myself a downhill 12‑footer with eight inches of break and hit a good putt and fortunately caught the side of the hole.   
   
 Q.   Do you scoreboard watch?   Do you cut watch?   Are you conscious of it as you play?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   A little bit.   I try to not be until the end.   I knew I needed to make something happen and the nice birdie at 7, I asked my guy if he thought we needed one more, and he said I think we'll be good at 8, where we were.   
So I tried to just march out to the left, got a big kick and went to the back of the green, as I'm sure most of them did, and then made a great putt to save par.   
   
 Q.   What's it feel like to know you got a weekend here when so many people have struggled and not made it and some big names are going home?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   No, I'm proud of my determination at the end of that round.   I really hung in there, I made some great up‑and‑downs.   I didn't hit it fantastic today, but just got it around to shoot 2‑over on that course at the end of the day is pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Expectations for the weekend?   The U.S. Open brings a lot of people back to the field.   It doesn't necessarily rule you out.   
KEVIN STREELMAN:   No, the leaders are at 1‑under, I'll be going off by myself first thing in the morning, by myself.   The greens should be great.   The wind should be down.   I'll play nice and fast by myself.   And if I can shoot 1, 2, 3‑under, I'll get right back in the tournament.   
   
 Q.   And you're playing alone?  
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yeah, I'm playing alone.   They asked if I wanted a marker; but I said, no, I'm fine by myself.
