Quotes from:
KEVIN STREELMAN
Q. Got out there and didn't try to force anything and finished strong.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I hit it really well today.  Didn't make a ton of putts, but good start and good position.
Q. How is the golf course playing?  It looks soggy.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, it's definitely wet.  Hopefully we won't get too much more rain, but the greens are magnificent.  They're rolling really nice.
Q. Do you like this portion of the schedule, like the wrap-around idea?
KEVIN STREELMAN: You know, I really do.  I think the fans get a kick out of it.  I think they enjoy watching us play more golf, and it gives us a nice run right before the holidays.
Q. All right.  I can't let you out of here as a Duke graduate without a comment on the Miami-Duke game last week.  What was your thoughts on the final play?
KEVIN STREELMAN: I mean it was pretty disappointing.  You know, it was clearly a bad call four times.  (Laughs).  I mean with a nine-minute replay, they would have got it right.  But it's just a shame, because there's a lot of implications with that decision.  But I'm proud of what Duke's done with the football team, and Coach Cutcliffe has done an incredible job turning them around, and we'll see if we can beat Carolina on Saturday.
