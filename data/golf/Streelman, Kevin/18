Q. I wanted to ask you about the whole child birth thing and the whole circumstances there. 
KEVIN STREELMAN: Well, we're very fortunate that we had the baby, well, three and a half weeks early and not six weeks early like my daughter was.

Q. Yeah, I know. 
KEVIN STREELMAN: Not six weeks early, like my daughter was. The due date was exactly for the Masters and we thought it would probably be a little early, it did actually but 36 and a half weeks was great. He came out super healthy and is doing well and Courtneys doing well. I miss them, but they're at home.

Q. Obviously, how, how much a danger did you think you were of not being able to come and obviously if the birth were to happen on this week, I'm assuming you wouldn't be here. 
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I definitely would be home, if that were the case. When we looked at it we first kind of laughed but I said, knowing my daughter was six weeks early and with this liver condition called cholestasis, which my wife has, we knew it would be an early pregnancy. So it all worked out great.

Q. How has that impacted your preparation, if any?
KEVIN STREELMAN: I would say a little. At home, golf wasn't quite the No. 1 priority, but I was fortunate to get out to Houston last week. Though I didn't play great, I just did a lot of good practice and knowing I was prepping for this week and I did some great work here, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. And today I was able to keep it in front of me and make putts when I needed to and it was a really solid start.

Q. You were even through 17. Is that where you finished?
KEVIN STREELMAN: I birdied 18 and shot 1‑under. 

Q. Sorry I missed it. But, yeah, so how do you feel just about where you are right now going into tomorrow?
KEVIN STREELMAN: It's a great start. It's going to be a very difficult week. The wind is blowing here this morning, it's still windy, and will be until Sunday (wind noise). Keep on playing. 

Q. Who is your swing coach right now?
KEVIN STREELMAN: My friend Jake Thurm. He's a kid I grew up with. But we studied under Doctor Jim Suttie who is my first instructor when I was a young kid, so it's been a great relationship with him. T H U R M is his name. 

Q. (Indiscernible)
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, he's still a great friend. 

Q. (Indiscernible)
KEVIN STREELMAN: I wore my Duke outfit on one of the days in honor of North Carolina losing. I felt terrible for them. 
(Laughter.) It was a heck of a ball game though, I will give them that.
