  Q. (No Microphone.)
 KEVIN STREELMAN:   Great kid.  I enjoy walking with him, his caddie is one of my best buddies out here.  So I feel fortunate, I played nicely last week and made a bunch of birdies at the Honda, just a few too many mistakes, but the putter feels nice and I tend to drive it and hit it pretty good, so who knows what can happen.
 Q. How do you like this golf course, the setup, as it relates to your game?
 KEVIN STREELMAN:   I think it's a ton of fun.  A lot of slopes we can use, they can put some fun pins out here, you get rewarded if you hit it into the right pockets.  It's just risk/reward on a few holes and it's kind of right there in front of you.  I think it's really exciting for our fans and it's fun to play with us.
 Q. You call him a kid, you're one of the seasoned vets out here now, aren't you?
 KEVIN STREELMAN:   That happens so quick.  He was born in '97, I was graduating high school the year he was born and it's just like, geez, they're getting good, they're getting good and young.
