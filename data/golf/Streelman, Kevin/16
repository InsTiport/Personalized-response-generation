Q. Looked like a pretty nice round.  Just the one blemish at 15, but looked like a pretty nice save on the last one.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Got a great save there on the last, couple of birdies before that to get that in.  Wind died down.  Greens still are holding strong and beautiful, as they always are here.  I wanted to get up there within a few shots of the lead to get myself in contention for the weekend.  So great course for that.  Going to be a fun weekend.
Q. Can you just tell us what happened on 15.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Bad drive.  Only bad drive in a few days.
Q. Would you say that's been your strength the last few days, your driving?
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I always drive it good.  I went and saw my old instructor, the first guy that ever taught me the game, and we just got a couple simple ideas, and I've been really hitting it well since.  I'm excited for the weekend.  Hitting well, just started reading my own putts, not relying on my caddie so much, just doing what I see and rolling it and putting pretty well.
Q. Keep it going.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Thank you.
