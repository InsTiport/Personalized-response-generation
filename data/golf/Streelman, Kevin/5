Q. Kevin, does this situation feel like 2014 at all? Any similarities to you right now?
KEVIN STREELMAN: You know, I wouldn't say -- it's a good question. You know, I did shoot -- I think I shot 64 that Saturday so was able to beat that by a shot. But I mean, the way Brendon and obviously DJ are playing, it's going to take another great one tomorrow. The course is just playing beautifully, the greens are perfect, and without much wind we're able to attack a lot of the golf course. If you don't shoot at least 3-, 4-, 5-under par you're going to be losing ground.
Q. You played well, but can you speak to what Brendon Todd did today and what he's been doing for three days?
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I wish we were like partners at New Orleans or something today. We were both rolling in a lot of putts. He putted just perfectly out there. Every putt inside of 15, 20 feet looks like it's going to go in, and today most of them did go in. He's always been an incredible putter. He's swinging it great, and when he's putting well he's tough to beat.
Q. Do you feel pretty good going into tomorrow?
KEVIN STREELMAN: I do, yeah. I have played -- this is three weeks in a row away from the family, which I've never done three in a row, which is too much, to be honest. I miss them dearly. But going to try and have one more great day and get home and take a week off and enjoy some time with the kids.
