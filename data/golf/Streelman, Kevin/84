  Q. What's the experience like, people cheering for you more?   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: I heard Streelman a couple of times. They were saying "Steelman" and now they have the "Str" in there.   
 It's just fun. Game feels like it's progressing on a little better each week and I'm going to go one more now and play Tiger's event and take the week after that off. Looking forward to that break and feel like I'm playing well right now.   
  
  Q. Do you feel comfortable out here now?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Think I that's the biggest part. I feel really good coming back near home for me. I grew up on bentgreens and hit-it-straight type of golf courses and that's where I feel comfortable. I have my parents here and my wife here, and it's near home.   
  
  Q. A lot of guys making moves today, is it how the course is playing?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: The key is the greens are soft, and any week on TOUR when the greens are soft, you're going to be able to fire at pins. We're able to go at a decent amount of them, and got the putter hot.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you're getting to the point where there's a win in your future?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Just going to keep trying my best each week. I definitely am I lot more comfortable out here than I was the first two or three months of the year. It's a process.   
 Leading a major is going to be the highlight of my career so far.
