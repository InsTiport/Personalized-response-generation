  Q. Comments about the round. Obviously you're just continuing right on.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, it was a frustrating first nine for me, but to hang in there and do that on the back was pretty cool. I think 30 on the back side was kind of fun.  
  
  Q. What clicked? What changed between the front and the back?   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: My putting. I made everything on the back side. And the front side, I had two bad three-putts. I just gunned it by. I didn't have bad lines, I just hit it eight, nine feet by. I tried to rest and didn't really play much Wednesday or Thursday, and I think they sped the greens up on us a little bit, and I wasn't here to practice and check it out, which is my own fault. But I made the adjustments on the back side and got a better speed and feel to it.  
  
  Q. How are you feeling going into tomorrow?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I'm hitting it great and my short game feels solid. As I said, this is the type of course, you keep it in the fairway, the way I feel like I'm hitting my irons right now, I'm going to have a good amount of birdie chances. We'll see what happens. I don't have much to lose.
