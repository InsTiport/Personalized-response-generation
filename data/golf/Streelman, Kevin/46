  KEVIN STREELMAN:   Things got a little bumpy out there, but I'm looking forward to getting on some fresh ones in the morning and I'm hitting it great, so just keep doing what I'm doing.

Q.   If it weren't for that short miscue at the 15th, it would have been a blemish‑free round?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I made a bomb on the hole before.   So things always seem to even each other out.

Q.   What's it going to take to get yourself in contention this weekend?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   We'll see how the weather is.   I think the wind is supposed to pick up a touch. 
But this course, if you can stay on track, 3, 4, 5‑under each day you should have a chance at the end.   What's that add up to, 15‑, 20‑under, something like that.

Q.   Either one of those numbers should be good. 
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yes, we'll see what we can do this weekend.
