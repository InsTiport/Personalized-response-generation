Q.   Putting the heat on Ben, obviously that was your strategy.   How do you think you performed?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I was just really happy.   It was a great way to start the year, and happy for Ben.   He's a great kid, and he played great.   I'm glad he birdied the last.   It makes me feel better about not hitting my putt hard enough.   But he's a great guy.

Q.   The difficulty of that 18 putt, were you aware, A, that you didn't have the lead, and what were you thinking standing over it?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I just was trying to be free and just whack it, and I hit it right on that left edge and just didn't hit it hard enough, and it curled off.   I made my share this weekend.

Q.   Considering where you started the day, five back, are you going to walk away from here saying, I'm happy with myself or maybe be disappointed that you didn't quite get it done?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   No, I've had some nice wins where I've come from behind, so I tried to get the young pup and tried to put a little heat on him and just didn't have enough firepower.   I'm very happy.   Good way to start the year.
