 Q.   Can you just talk about your round today?   
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yeah, it was a really solid round.   I kept the ball in front of me, hit a ton of fairways, really hit a lot of greens.   Not sure of the total number, but it was the majority of them, and I was fortunate to have a really nice finish and birdie two of the last three.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised at how packed this leaderboard is?   
KEVIN STREELMAN:   These greens are getting really firm, and much faster today than they were even the last two days, so not too surprised.   I had to hit some really good shots just to save pars, and you never know when you post a good score.  
   
 Q.   What is it about today to post that 67; what worked?   
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I just hit it great.   I was smart on my putts.   I didn't attack really fast putts and had a couple good looks and was able to make some good advantage of those.   Just stayed really patient.
