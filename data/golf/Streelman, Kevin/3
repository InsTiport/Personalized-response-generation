  Q. That's quite the turnaround; just some thoughts on today's round.
 KEVIN STREELMAN:   You know, it's funny when you just free yourself up a little bit.  I maybe put a little too much pressure on myself the first two days, but also just a really difficult golf course.  I missed a few fairways by a foot or two and had absolutely nothing Thursday and Friday.  Today I kind of hit the fairways and did what I was supposed to, kept a few below the hole and putted nicely.  In the end, I didn't make any mistakes and was able to make a nice round of golf.
 Q. At the end of the day who knows how many spots you might move up; how good does it feel on a Saturday morning to come out and shoot a score like that?
 KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yeah, it is fun.  I was contemplating retiring last night, so it's good to come out -- I'll give it another week.  At least my wife will maybe give me another week.  Sometimes you have the opportunity on big golf courses, in big events, if you can get out early on a Saturday and make a move -- obviously I wish I wasn't so far out of it, but who knows.  If I can have another big day tomorrow, anything can happen.  I had a nice round today, got some confidence back and feel good.
