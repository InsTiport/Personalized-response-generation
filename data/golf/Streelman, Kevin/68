   KEVIN STREELMAN: It was a nice start. The greens are rolling great and I hit some good shots. 

 Q. The TOUR moved some of the tees up a little bit, especially on 18 to make the course more manageable. 
 KEVIN STREELMAN: When we got here, we played the tips in the practice rounds. We were hitting 3- and 4-irons into par 4s; with as much undulation on these greens, it was almost unplayable. Moving the tees up a little bit makes it a little bit more fair and scorable and makes it fair for everybody. 
 Yesterday went up to Winged Foot. I'm feeling good right now. 

 Q. Talk about the Smile Train, changing the world one smile at a time, it's such a worthwhile charity. 
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, tens of thousands of children are born with a cleft palate and the Smile Train gives them free surgery.
