  Q. I wanted to talk to you for a minute, get a comment about playing with Nathan. I put a thing in your locker so you sort of knew the story a little bit before you went out.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Tell me what that was like. I got a comment from Webb earlier.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah. It was a great day for both of us, just to see what he's been through, the bad break and see him battle through and come out even stronger.   
 It's inspirational for -- a lot more for me than I'm sure it is for him, so it's fun to walk next to him and be so fortunate to become buddies with him, and he lives in Phoenix. So it's an amazing story.  
  
  Q. Sort of what the whole concept of this tournament's about; right?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah. Exactly. Some of the guys out here are doing really special things. I'm glad to be part of it.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised at how he played?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: He played pretty good, especially the first play, he made an awesome 4 for 3, par for birdie. I was just going from the get-go, we were just going to try and have fun and enjoy ourselves as much as possible and I think we did a good job of that.   
  
  Q. Okay. Thank you. Good playing.
