  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: I got off to a nice start, birdied the first two. The wind was down for the most part, so it was a little bit gettable today. Greens are holding, and if you're able to keep the ball in the fairway you're able to attack a lot of pins. If this wind stays between five and ten miles an hour, I assume there's going to be a lot of birdies tomorrow, too.  
  
  Q. Talk about playing early on Saturday.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: It's something that we all have to deal with and you have to adjust to. We all do it Thursday and Friday anyway, so it's not a huge difference. But you just go to sleep a little earlier, and that makes things all right.   
  
  Q. What's it like to be done early and be able to relax?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Exactly. We have to go to the laundromat today. My wife just got back from Europe, so we've got to do a bunch of laundry and kind of the darker side of being on the road all the time. But it's nice. It's nice to have the afternoon off, do a little practice and then go hang out.   
  
  Q. So you're going to do some practice, do a little laundry and get ready to play tomorrow?  
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, do a little practice, a little laundry, dinner, then hit the hay, watch a little basketball.  
  
  Q. You're in good position heading into tomorrow.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, I just wanted to get myself into position today. Looks like I'll be maybe three, four, maybe five at the most back, which is definitely doable. Obviously tomorrow is a huge day, and there's a lot of guys right there. So it's going to be anybody's ballgame.
