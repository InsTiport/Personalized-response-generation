Q. Talk about you and Larry playing today.  Talk about the week and teaming up with him.
KEVIN STREELMAN: Yeah, well we have been good friends for a little while, ever since he started the game, just like four, four and a half years ago now, so.  But he just absolutely loves it.  Like it's fun to watch his passion and his competitiveness that you can see on the football field come onto the golf course.  He wants to win.  He struggles off the tee a little bit, that's where his 13 comes from.  And if he had to play the back tees with us, he would have a little bit of a battle, as of right now, but by next year he'll have it ironed out.  But from his amateur tees he can hit his 3- and 4-iron and he's great from inside of 150.  He's a great putter.  So he just played awesome.
Q. Your form's been really good this year.  But playing with him and seeing it as well, do you happen to learn anything when you're playing with a guy like him?
KEVIN STREELMAN: You know, I wouldn't say golf-wise, but I would say competitive-wise.  He is so just smooth, walks up, hardly takes any time, sees it and just whacks it.  He really cares, too.  It's something that he's really passionate about, so it's fun to be a part of.
