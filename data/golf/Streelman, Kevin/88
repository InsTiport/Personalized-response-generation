   KEVIN STREELMAN:  I still have the emotions of yesterday.  I was just a little bit drained today, didn't have all my energy, and really was expecting not to play with the weather that they were predicting.  It was a really nice day, which was kind of surprising.   
 But couldn't really get much going.  Didn't have my "A" game today.   
  
  Q.  You're the guy that everybody loves to root for out there.  You know why?  You are living the dream.  Four minutes before a tee time, you're not playing in this tournament, then you play great in this tournament.  You're playing with Tiger Woods.  I mean, you didn't have a great Sunday but you walk around having a smile and having a good time.  Tell all the guys that dream of doing what you're doing what that feels like.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  It's amazing.  It's been a roller coaster of a week, to going from not even thinking I'm playing to looking like around a Top 30 finish.  I have to take positives from it.  I'm pretty drained.  I think yesterday took a lot out of me.   
  
  Q.  You were high-fiving people in the crowd.  I saw the highlights.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  It was too much fun not to.  You know, I've got a lot of great things to take from this week, just try and build on them throughout the year.  It's a long year, and it's a good finish and we're moving in the right direction.  I'm going to get in my car and head to Phoenix and try to Monday qualify tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  You're going to drive to Phoenix tonight?   
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  Yeah, I'll get in my car right now.  I've got that Z I've got to let go on the highway.  Tell the cops to stay away for a little bit (laughing).   
 I will be there tomorrow and don't expect too much, but sometimes that's when you play your best.  I'll give it my best shot.  If not, it'll be a good week off, and I have three big weeks coming up after that.   
  
  Q.  I've got to ask you about this because you even said it.  A lot of people don't realize how exhausting it is to play in that group with Tiger Woods because of the electricity that's there.  I mean, you must have slept good last night.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  We were all out by 7:30 last night.  It was hilarious.  We started a movie at about 7:15 and we were all out before the opening scene.   
  
  Q.  You've got to feel so good about going into the rest of this year the way that you're playing right now.   
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  Yeah, it feels good.  My game feels good.  The swing is close, and the putter let me down a little bit on the weekend, but like I said, I have to take positives from the week.  I've got a lot to look forward to.  I'm definitely into Pebble and my sponsor is in LA and then Canc√∫n after that.  It's just going to be an amazing three weeks, so I'm getting geared up for that and keep trying to improve every day.
