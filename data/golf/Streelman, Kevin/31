Q.   How did that 1‑under feel?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   It was an average day, I'd say.   I struggled with my ball striking a little bit.   Really proud of those late couple birdies are going to keep me in the tournament.   Three back, I feel like I have a good chance tomorrow.

Q.   The weather came in when you were in the middle part of your round.   Did it affect you today?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I came out and played three bogeys in five holes.   It obviously didn't affect me in a very good way, but can't make excuses.   It's the same for everybody, and I'm in position to win a tournament tomorrow.   It's good.

Q.   What do you need to do tomorrow?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   I've been putting and chipping awesome.   Just keep doing what I've been doing in my short game.   Just gotta hit the ball a little cleaner, and I expect to be there.

Q.   Try to be a little bit more aggressive?
KEVIN STREELMAN:   Yeah.   I'll see how the front nine goes.   If I can get 2, 3, 4‑under on the front, really just see what we need to do.
