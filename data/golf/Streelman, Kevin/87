 Q.  Kevin, what was it like? 
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  Man, that was one of the coolest things ever, no doubt about it.  He was fun to watch but just kind of fun to compare myself against him, as well.  It's inspiring and very educational.  I recommend everyone try it at least one time. 

 Q.  Standing on that first tee looking down the fairway with ten deep on each side, come on, you had to have a couple butterflies, maybe flying saucers? 
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  I did.  I was pretty jacked up.  I tried to turn it into adrenaline.  Swung as hard as I can and ripped one down there.  Glad it stayed between the rough lines. 

 Q.  You said you'd recommend this for everybody to try at least once.  Did the butterflies ever go away today? 
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  It was a ton of fun.  It was just adrenaline, excitement, a touch of butterflies for sure, but the more I got used to it and got into it, the more fun it was.  I wish I could have made a couple more putts out there, but shoot, it was a great day. 

 Q.  The cool thing is it was only Saturday.  You've still got tomorrow, you can try to get a Top 10 and play your way into Phoenix? 
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  Yeah, exactly.  That definitely is on the top of my mind.  I'd love to get into that event.  It's right near where we live now, so it's a course I practice at since I got my TOUR card, so I know it well. 

 Q.  You weren't even supposed to play this week.  In your wildest dreams did you think this early in your PGA TOUR career that you would get to play with Tiger Woods in the third round? 
 KEVIN STREELMAN:  No, no chance.  Like I said, it was a dream come true, but once again, I hope it's not my last time, either.  It's just inspirational for me as a professional golfer, and I want another shot at it.
