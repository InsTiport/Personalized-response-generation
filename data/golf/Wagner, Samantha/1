 Q.  Quite a match you guys had the first 10 holes.  I can't remember the last time I saw that, and then you won two in a row, they won two in a row.  How much have you played with them?  I know there's a Florida/Kentucky thing going on there.  Do you know each other?  
SAMANTHA WAGNER: No.   
 Q.  What happened, and how do you regroup coming hereafter they win 18 to force extra holes?  What's your mindset coming to this hole?  
SAMANTHA WAGNER: Just go after it.   
MARIA TORRES: Yeah, go after it.   
SAMANTHA WAGNER: At that point you have nothing to lose.   
MARIA TORRES: Try to do --   
SAMANTHA WAGNER: Yeah, I mean, I hit a good shot that unfortunately kicked, so I got the chip, and I was like, might as well just hole it out, she's close.  That was kind of the mindset is just go after it, I think.   
MARIA TORRES: Yeah.   
 Q.  Now you have a quick turnaround.  What's your game plan between rounds?  How do you stay sharp?  
SAMANTHA WAGNER: Eat.   
MARIA TORRES: Yeah, eat, and refresh a little bit, and just be ready for the next match.   
SAMANTHA WAGNER: Be ready to go.
