 Q.  So the first nine, even par, and then you started to heat up.  What happened?  SAMANTHA WAGNER: Honestly, I just kept playing how I was playing and made some putts.  I think I just kind of got into a rhythm.  I knew that nine, the front nine, is the lower side for me.  I think it's just a little easier, get more comfortable with birdies and everything.   Q.  You mentioned that you made some putts.  Is that the part of your game that you're most pleased with, or what else was going right?  SAMANTHA WAGNER: I was hitting a lot of greens.  I hit 14 greens today, and just I kept giving myself opportunities, which I was doing on the front, too.  I just kind of left everything on the edge.  But my putting is my strongest part of my game, so it definitely came through on that nine.   Q.  What did you think of the golf course?  SAMANTHA WAGNER: I love it, I absolutely love it.  It fits my game really well, and I love the greens.  Everything just feels great with my game.   Q.  How are you going to approach tomorrow?  SAMANTHA WAGNER: Probably just the same way I did today.  My mom and I are just having a lot of fun out here.  She's caddying for me for the first time.  We're just having fun, and I don't know, that's really all we did.  I didn't really concentrate on a score today.
