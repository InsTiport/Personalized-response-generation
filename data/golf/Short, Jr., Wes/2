 Q.  Every opportunity to pull out.  What compelled you to finish?  WES SHORT, JR.: I was just hoping I could get to the 18th and maybe get some help.  Maybe I could stay in contention.  Plus, it was my first really USGA and I wanted to try to finish.   Q.  What's the exact nature of the injury?  Is it a nerve issue, muscle issue, disk issue?  WES SHORT, JR.: I think they said might have been like a back -- I mean a muscle.  They said -- physio came out a couple times and they didn't think I could damage it any further so I just continued to play.   Q.  It seemed like Vijay was pretty accommodating throughout the round, trying to make sure that sort of facilitate the play.  I thought that was pretty helpful.  WES SHORT, JR.: I thought he was great and I hope I didn't mess him up because I was going slow and it was painful.   Q.  Great round all things considered.  Play well tomorrow.  WES SHORT, JR.: Thanks
