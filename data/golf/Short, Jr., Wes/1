 Q.  Thank you so much for taking some time.  Really wonderful round of golf.  How would you assess your play?  
WES SHORT, JR.: I played pretty good today.  I wish I'd made a few more putts, but kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth, missing a short one on the last hole.  He played really good today, too, and it was fun to be out there watching him and trying to compete.   
 Q.  How different were the conditions?  Did it make it much more difficult today?  
WES SHORT, JR.: I think it was a little windier.  It made you think a little bit more around the golf course.  But as far as, I think it's about the same as it was the other days, just a five-mile-an-hour more wind probably.   
 Q.  You've put yourself in a very nice position going into tomorrow.  Do you feel like this golf course lends itself to coming from behind or from a few shots back or would you rather obviously be in the lead?  
WES SHORT, JR.: Well, you'd be a little closer, because he's playing awfully good, he's going to be hard to catch, especially four shots.   
I like the course.  If you play a really good round like he did today, you can make up some ground.
