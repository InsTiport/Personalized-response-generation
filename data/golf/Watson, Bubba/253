Q.   What a wild card. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, but the thing is just putting.   I had six 3‑putts, natural 3‑putts.   I had two from just on the fringe that I consider.   So eight 3‑putts in two days. 
So when you do that, you look at it, I'm 4‑over, without that I would be 4‑under, just two off the lead.   It just comes down to the greens are slower than what we're used to.   I'm used to it being a lot more difficult and different pin placements and the ball was just not rolling like I thought.   So I left just about every putt short it seems like. 

Q.   Looks like you're right square on the cut line. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, not that I'm thinking about it, but Jason, it's all up to Jason Day.   If he makes birdie on the last hole, I'm out.   And if he makes par, I'm still hanging around. 

Q.   How do you feel about that?   Yesterday you said you still got your Green Jacket.   But I got the feeling it seemed like you were playing hard today. 
BUBBA WATSON:   I made seven birdies.   So when you make seven birdies in one day‑‑ it's just the 3‑putts.   It's just the green speed is not what we're used to.   And it hasn't rained.   It rained a little bit, but not like what would slow the course down.   It's the first time I ever seen it this slow. 
And I play by feel.   So I'm going off of the years past, tournaments past, watching on TV, how fast it is, and it doesn't have the bite to it like some guys are saying, I mean this is not really the Masters that we're all used to seeing. 

Q.   This place is always a mental test, but when you have a day like you did today, seven birdies and that, how mentally exhausting was it?
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, again, let's just worry about the putting, not the score.   I just can't get a putt to the hole.   So I made a couple putts that got to the hole.   But for the most part I was leaving them all short.   So that's the frustrating part.   And then the mental part, when you really want to look at the mental part, five and a half hours?   Of a round of golf, it's not fun for anybody.   Probably for you guys either sitting here for that long.   I mean that's just miserable golf.   So we're working about banning putters, we should be worried about speeding up golf.

Q.   You can't worry about what happens now.   But tomorrow‑‑
BUBBA WATSON:   If I hear a roar that means I probably didn't make it.

Q.   How do you go into the weekend if this is, if you do in fact get in?
BUBBA WATSON:   Obviously I'm playing well.   I just got to make the putts.   I got to somehow make myself hit it harder on the putts, the longer putts. 
And I haven't looked at the weather, but let's just say the weather is windy again.   And I'm going to go out first, obviously if I do make it, so when you look at that, there's away I can shoot 5‑under, get under par for the Tournament, and be right there.   Nobody's really running away from it.   We had a guy shoot low yesterday, but kind of fell back.   So it's really the same score as yesterday.   So if it was windy, they start feeling the nerves, anything under par after tomorrow would be a great opportunity on Sunday. 

Q.   Have you ever had around like this so up‑and‑down, up‑and‑down?
BUBBA WATSON:   Oh, yeah, I had tons of those. 
(Laughter.)   That's what we call Bubba golf.   I've never really ‑‑ I've missed putts and people said I putted bad, but eight 3‑putts in two days is quite a bit. 

Q.   How many were there today?
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, just like yesterday, three normal and then the one from the fringe.   So one was like two inches off the green.   So I count that.   But so four both days. 

Q.   Can you see ‑‑
BUBBA WATSON:   I try to equal it out.   I want to make it all balanced. 

Q.   You can see it in the faces of maybe family or friends in the galleries of how up‑and‑down it is?   You keep your cool, but they're kind of losing it?
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, no, I'm worrying about golf, I'm not worried about what people in the gallery are doing.   I would be more of a problem if I did that.

Q.   Why do you think the course was so slow?
BUBBA WATSON:   I just play golf, I don't know how to grow grass.   Obviously like on 14, that pin they had today was a new pin.   And the way that pin is, they have to slow it down because you wouldn't be able to stop some of the putts.   So I think there's away that they slowed it down a little bit because of certain pin placements that they're trying out.   Like No. 2, that pin placement, I never really seen that one and if it was lightning fast like it's been the last few years, that pin would be really unplayable. 

Q.   Last night and this morning, did you work extra on the putting just because of the pace?
BUBBA WATSON:   No, it's one of those things, it's just, it's in my mind, I'm a feel player, it's just in my mind and I'm trying to respect the golf course and think it's going to be the Masters that we know and love and obviously I don't know and love it right now.   Because I 3‑putted every hole, it seemed like. 

Q.   You talked about the rest.   What are you going to do now?
BUBBA WATSON:   I'm going to change my shoes and go home.

Q.   You're not going to stay and look and see what happens?
BUBBA WATSON:   No, I'll find out.   I don't need to sit and watch him.   Maybe go yell at him, but not sit and watch him.
