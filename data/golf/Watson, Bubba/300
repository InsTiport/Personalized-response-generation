Q.   Obviously pretty close to cut line but it looks likes you're going to be back for the weekend. 
Are you happy about that?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yes, very happy about it.   You know, I'm going to play two more days and re-evaluate my situation.   I'm exhausted. 
Mentally, I've lost focus just about every shot so I'm trying to figure it out.   Just not really right right now.   I want to be home with my son and wife. 
After the Masters win we really haven't had time to celebrate and think about what happened and living this dream out.   It's just tiring.   I know that seems like a cop-out but I'm not playing very good because I'm just really not into it.

Q.   Are you that surprised that it's kind of overkilling you and affecting your game like that?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yes.   You know, we know I'm a weak-minded person.   We know throughout -- this is my 7th year on Tour -- that I have mental issues, I struggle a little bit. 
It's just overwhelming all the positive energy that everybody is coming with and all the signatures everybody wants.   I'm signing everybody's autograph, all the players that are asking for stuff for their charities. 
It's overwhelming.   I'm not really focused on golf.   It's something you got to learn from and hopefully get better with it.

Q.   Two days after this one, you refocus for the weekend.   What are your goals now, still hope to win this one?   What do you hope to get out it?
BUBBA WATSON:   I slept for a little over ten hours yesterday.   My tee time is bright and early tomorrow.   Just rest, hopefully stay hydrated and just try to grind it out.   Try to get in that Top 25.   Right now I'm barely making the cut.   Try to sneak up the leaderboard like some of the other guys are doing.

Q.   The shot on 17, birdied that hole there.   Was it a 5-iron or 7-iron?   What did you hit right there?
BUBBA WATSON:   6-iron.   193.   Breeze a little into us.   I was trying to hit a little low 6-iron.   Somehow I made the putt.   I didn't putt good on the back-9.   It caused me to stay on the cut line right now.

Q.   Looking down the road, will you consider changing your schedule to kind of give yourself a little more time at home with your family?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yes.
