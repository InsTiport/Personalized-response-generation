  Q. Great job today. You hung in there, didn't make any bogeys, just never really felt like you got any momentum going?  
 BUBBA WATSON: I started off kind of slow, didn't really do much. I had a chance to go low, it was a great day. It was a great week. Just Bill played a little bit better.  
  
  Q. Fun coming down the stretch though, 16, 17, 1, when all you guys were in there. Wasn't that fun?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Well, maybe for you. It wasn't fun for us. Even Bill, we were nervous. We talked about it. He striped a perfect 3-iron on the last hole, and I knew if I made eagle, we got lucky with the guys didn't make birdies there.   
 So I knew if Bill hit a great shot, it was going to be hard to beat him, but eagle would still have a chance, and I almost chipped in.  
  
  Q. After actually you had chipped in earlier in the round for your first birdie of day?  
 BUBBA WATSON: On 7, I chipped in, it was nice. But that would have been nicer to chip that last one in.   
  
  Q. Congratulations. Did you learn something from this that might help you even more? You keep knocking on the door.   
 BUBBA WATSON: These guys are good. It's hard to win out here.
