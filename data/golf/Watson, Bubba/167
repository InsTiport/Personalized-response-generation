Q.   For the third day in a row, that golf course played really tough and I thought you hung in there good enough to give you a chance on Sunday?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, this whole week has been a struggle ball‑striking.   But I've been plodding around the golf course with the struggle but making pars.   That's the key is making pars and try to make some good putts.   So that's what I've been doing so far.

Q.   You struggled a little bit off the tee and we had you down for just six fairways?
BUBBA WATSON:   The whole week, my highest for the week is six fairways.   That's pretty good.   We're moving on up.

Q.   The birdie at 17 really kept it in and you almost holed out from the fringe on 18?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, that birdie on 17, that's what I was hoping for, make some pars and get downwind on 17.   That's what I did.   Hit a good tee shot with 4‑iron in there and made an easy birdie. 

Q.   You know you can win this tournament; you've done it before. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   It's all about the weather tomorrow.   I'm not known as a great player in the rain because of my swing speed, so hopefully tomorrow I can stay calm and stay consistent and put off just this little bit of water we're going to have.
