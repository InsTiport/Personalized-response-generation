 Q.   How much easier was the course playing than usual today?   
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, the wind was going in our favor.   The wind was downwind on 18.   When it's downwind on 18, it plays a little easier and that hole alone plays a lot easier.   
So for us, it was‑‑ some of the par 5s are into the wind but those are ones that are tough to reach anyway.   I think the golf course plays a little easier with this type of wind and this direction.   So just that alone helped out.   And then it started dying down by the end of the day.   
So you know, this is‑‑ we should be able to play good golf in these kind of conditions on the whole.   I might play bad, but everybody plays good.   
   
 Q.   Your group I think was 16‑under total.   Do you guys feed off each other if somebody is playing well?   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yes, you can.   Especially if you're‑‑ because you're loose, you're enjoying the day.   You're playing with‑‑ I was playing with two other guys and their caddies that I know well.   
So we are just out there talking about random stuff and enjoying the day, and then the weather was perfect and then, you know, what you do so well, is when you're playing with two greats like Steve Stricker and Phil Mickelson, for me, it steps my game up; or I need to step up or I'm going to be embarrassed, you know.   
When you put us in these groupings, these elite fields like this, you're always playing with a top‑notch player, and so you just always have to step your game up and stay focused, pretty much like a Major Championship.     
   
 Q.   You talked about some swing issues; how did the swing feel today?  
BUBBA WATSON:   It feels great.   That's the thing, I lost some weight, I had some sicknesses the first part of the year.   My swing, because I was so tired, trying to fight these sicknesses off, my swing was getting off, hitting some hooks.   But then the last, I don't know, three weeks or so, being able to eat, being able to work out, do all the things that I want to do, obviously I'm getting better each day.
