Q. So had five birdies today.  You were the only one who birdied No. 8.
BUBBA WATSON: What was 8?  Oh, the par 3.
Q. You're the only one who birdied it the whole tournament.
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, I got lucky and made a 30-footer.  No, it was a good day.  Obviously, I wish I could finish so I could watch the game all the way through tonight.  But it will be some good rest and just get ready and play the last few holes, and hopefully we can get the golf in tomorrow as well.
Q. And how did the weather affect your play?
BUBBA WATSON: The weather didn't affect my play.  The golf course affects the play more than anything.  We always got off the golf course before the rain.  So the rain had no chance to affect us or anything.  So the weather has no effect.
I came out with three birdies after the first delay.  So I guess it helped me better than it hurt me.
Q. Yeah, you had a total of five.  You had a killer first front nine.  He you had some bogeys and some birdies mixed in there.
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, you're going to do that.
Around here in '07, I finished 9 over and finished fifth.  When you've got 1 over, I've got eight more bogeys I can make and still finish fifth.  When you look at it from that perspective, I had a par 5 coming up after No. 3 when I bogeyed, and I birdied.  I bogeyed the other hole, and I birdied three in a row.
So I just kept fighting.  You don't really think about the mistakes or the bogeys because you're going to have -- everybody's going to make bogeys out here.  The golf course is that difficult.
