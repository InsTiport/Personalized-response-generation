 Q.  Must be disappointing to start this way?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, it's disappointing to loose.  We played well.  I hit the ball really good.  Just didn't make any putts. If you go back to their round, I don't think they hit it better than us, they obviously putted than us.  They made their key putts.  If one wasn't making the birdie putt, the other one was.  They worked together as a team. And me and Webb just never made a putt.   Q.  Did you feel like the two of you coming in today had a good group going between the two of you?  BUBBA WATSON: For sure.  We played well.  We had a bunch of putts during the practise round.  We play practise games against our team, and we didn't lose.  Either our team is really bad or we did really good in the practise rounds.  We just didn't make any putts today.  That's the key. We're not upset at what we did.  There's going to be a winner and a loser, and obviously we want to be winners.  They just made the putts today.   Q.  Was the wind a major effect on your game?  BUBBA WATSON: No, no.  I think we hit the balls great all day.  Again, we just didn't make the putts.  They made putts; we didn't. It wasn't the ball striking or anything that was scary.  Again, it comes down to putting.  That's what this professional golf game is, it's all about putting.  I see that my other teammates, a couple of them, are putting pretty well..
