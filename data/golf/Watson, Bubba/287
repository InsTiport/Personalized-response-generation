  BUBBA WATSON:   Any time you shoot under par is good.   I was up there early.   I got through 5‑under.   I struggled with a three‑putt, struggled with a bad swing on 14.   But all in all, any time you shoot under par in a major championship it's pretty good. 

Q.   Was it frustrating for those two holes?
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, no, if you look at where I was yesterday it was pretty good.   Yesterday it looked like I was going to miss the cut as bad as I was playing.   To get back to under par, 2‑under for the tournament‑‑ I still have to shoot a low round tomorrow, but it can be done.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BUBBA WATSON:   It's not easy at all.   You've got to make putts.   And if you look, my birdies were a couple shortish putts, but there was a lot of long putts that I made that normally you just two‑putt.   To shoot a low round around here, you're going to have to hit some great iron shots but also make a lot of long putts.

Q.   Has winning the Masters made a difference to your approach? 
BUBBA WATSON:   No, I still want to win, just like I did before.   I just happened to win one.   So, no, it's the same thing, same process.   Just try to grind out good scores.

Q.   Are you more confident whenyou arrive? 
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, obviously when you win one, you can‑‑ in your career win one.   So yeah, obviously I'm more confident, because I've done it before.   So that means I have a good shot of doing it again.

Q.   Do you enjoy the Americans filling the leaderboard?
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, obviously, no, I'd rather it be me on the leaderboard; who cares about the other people.   It's just how it is.   Golf goes in cycles just like all sports.   Europeans were winning all the majors it seems like, what, a year ago, two years ago, and right now we're just winning them.   Just one of those things.   Every sport goes in cycles.   Every team has a good team once in a while and then they struggle and then come back and do it again.

Q.   Have you enjoyed the crowd support? 
BUBBA WATSON:   Oh, for sure.   You really enjoy that, any time you get support.   Bad shots or good shots, it's always good to have a little bit of support.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, me and him both fell apart at the same place, so we were both struggling.   We were both quiet those few holes we both struggled together.   But yea, he's a good player.   It's one of those things, just like yesterday when I was 5‑over through 7.   It can happen to the best players in the world real quick.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BUBBA WATSON:   No, I'm trying to focus on my own double bogey I was making.   I was losing my cool where I was.

Q.   The wind is expected tomorrow; how is that going to affect your approach?
BUBBA WATSON:   We do the same approach.   Hitting quality golf shots is going to be tougher just because it's going to change your swing, just because it's going to move you, sway you because of the wind, but then your ball is going to be ‑‑ harder to hit fairways, harder to hit greens because of the rougher winds.   But for a guy like me that's way back, we need tough conditions so we can play great and hope to move up.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, I'm hoping it's calm when I play and then it's really rough for them and rainy for them, too.
