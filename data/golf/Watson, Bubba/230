  BUBBA WATSON:   I fought hard.   My caddie just said keep going, keep going, give me one hole, give me one hole.   He kept pushing me and somehow it came out to me winning.   
It's a just short week.   You have one less day than normal to prepare.   So the energy level is just not where I want it to be.   Hopefully some rest today, hanging out with the family by the pool.   Be ready tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Coming off the win at the Northern Trust, knowing your game is in good shape, how does that help with, as you said, clicking and have that short week of rest?  
BUBBA WATSON:   I know if I can somehow pull some energy together and focus, I can perform.   
And so down the stretch today, I played pretty solid.   I was under par for the day.   He was playing really good on the front, made some long putts.   For me, I held it together and made some birdies coming down the stretch.   Had some chances for birdie that he ended up giving to me, so I never putted them.   I got some energy on the stretch and somehow I pulled it out against him.  
   
 Q.   Having had some success at this course before, do you kind of know the course better than ‑‑ I guess we've been four or five years?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, you know, what I notice so far this year is that it's a lot slower.   The green speeds are a lot slower.   So chipping the ball is a little easier with the humps and bumps all over these greens.   You have to be careful when you are putting uphill towards the mountain.   It's a lot slower than what we're used to over the last few yeas.   But I think it's gettable.   
I know the course quite well.   I know what I've hit over the last few years.   It's one of those courses I know pretty well.   
   
 Q.   Is it different with obviously the temperature change from last year?   You're hitting it farther.   Does it take a day to figure out what your yardages are versus last year?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   The first hole today we had 156 from the middle of the fairway and I hit my gap wedge, my 52 degree, and it went long.   
I had 171 on the second hole today.   I hit pitching wedge.   It was pin high.   So you find out quick how solid you're hitting it and how far it's going.   
Yesterday was a good indication of that.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned your energy level.   But being able to be finished by 11:30, you got the whole day to relax a little bit and recharge the batteries, what does that mean?  
BUBBA WATSON:   It's a lot.   It means a lot.   It's good to go home, hang out with the family, watch the little boy play around a little bit.   Look forward to the challenge tomorrow.   Hopefully get some good rest tonight.  
   
 Q.   Is it hard when you win‑‑ I mean, obviously you want to win every time you play, but is it hard to psych yourself up for the next week after a win?   You've probably been through people patting you on the back for three or four days now.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, it's hard too, this week is a tough week because you have one less day.   You start on Wednesday instead of Thursday.   
So yeah, you get over it.   You get caught up sometimes in the hoopla of the high fives and the cheers and the celebrations.   So the energy level and the focus ‑‑ when I say energy level, I'm talking about energy level to focus on the golf course.   It makes it tougher.
