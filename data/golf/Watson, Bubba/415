  Q.  A little quicker out there today after the delay?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  Yeah, after the delay.   
  
  Q.  Just get back here on 18 at least, and overall not happy?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  No, my caddie -- I'll be honest.  I messed up today.  My caddie told me to chip out on 15, and I said, I'm going to be a hero, I'm going to go for it and try and get on the other fairway and try to win this golf tournament.  He said, "It's a little early for that."  I said, "No, no, we're going to birdie this hole."  I hit it in the hazard and hit it right into a hole, so I made an 8, and afterwards he laughed at me and said, "Next time we'll chip out."  I said, "Yeah, you're right."   
  
  Q.  But you're really not out.  You're in striking distance.   
 BUBBA WATSON:  Yeah, it's good.  I'll be far enough out and nobody will be following our group hopefully, and I'll shoot about 7-, 8-under and watch them come in the last few holes hopefully.   
  
  Q.  Still anybody's game tomorrow?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  I think so.  You know, once somebody gets hot, they can go low out here.  You know, I think MacKenzie shot 7-under this afternoon.  You shoot that tomorrow, just about anybody can catch up, especially if the leaders just shoot even, 1-under, there's always a 10-under out there.  Somebody did that yesterday.   
  
  Q.  The turnaround for tomorrow, up and at 'em, is that going to --   
 BUBBA WATSON:  Yeah, 8:00 to 10:00, threesomes off of 1 and 10.   
  
  Q.  Are you ready for bad weather?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  It looks bad.  I just wish I was in the lead with bad weather coming because that means we might cancel and I could still win (laughter).  You know, I want it to be as nasty as possible so I'll have a chance to move up that leaderboard and get close to them.  I hope the first 17 holes are real good for me and then the back nine for them is real bad.   
  
  Q.  Bad weather, you play well in it?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  No, but I'm going to have to, I guess.  Nobody plays good in bad weather I don't think.
