Q. 4-under 68 today, pretty clean scorecard, are you happy with that?
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, very happy with it.  No bogeys.  So it was nice getting around here with no bogeys, making some birdies.  But I saw a lot of people went low today, about middle of the back, but it's good, I'll take it.
Q. 8-under I think is the leading score at the moment as we speak.  Is that something you could have shot today?
BUBBA WATSON: No, I think I played right where I was.  You know, I missed some putts but at the same time, I didn't make any mistakes, so I was pretty happy and I couldn't see me getting 8-under today.
Q. Every time you come to Sheshan International there's a huge crowd and the fans are absolutely great.  When you come back here, do you get the same sense of confidence that you do going back to courses like, say, Augusta?
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, when you had success here -- I finished 8th here and I finished first.  I've had a pretty good run here.  Looking forward to keep doing that, so hopefully the next three days will be pretty good.
Q. How are you going to celebrate your birthday tonight?
BUBBA WATSON: With rest.
Q. That's a nice celebration; Skyping home or Facebook?
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, talk to my kids.  Talked to them this morning, and then you know obviously I'll do that again tonight.  I'll face time them tonight.  Right when I go to bed, they are waking up, so yeah, I'll talk to them again.
