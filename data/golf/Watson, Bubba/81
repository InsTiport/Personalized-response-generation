Q. The captains said that the crowd was the 13th man, but I think Bubba Watson might have been.  Everybody seems to have mentioned you being here.  How much does this event mean to you?
BUBBA WATSON: The last event my dad saw me play was the Ryder Cup in 2010.  Nine days after the Ryder Cup, my dad passed away.  The last time he watched me play golf was the Ryder Cup.  He was at a hospital with a bunch of IVs in him and different things to keep him breathing and going so he could watch his son.
Then the two greatest things that I've ever wanted to accomplish in golf was be a Hall of Famer and be a Ryder Cup captain.  I think that Ryder Cup captain is another form of Hall of Fame.  I told the guys last night, this is the greatest thing I have ever done in golf.
Q. What was the week like for you?  You couldn't pick up a club, yet you had a big impact?
BUBBA WATSON: As a God fearing man, I love to help and I love to give.  Finally I found my place on the team is to help.  A couple guys called me and said, Bubba, I need you by my side, shoulder to shoulder.  And the last couple of days that's what I did.  It was a dream come true for me.  This is the greatest thing that I have ever done in golf.  I am so happy for this team.  This team was amazing.  They took me with open arms and let me be a part of it.
For U.S.A., for all that, this is absolutely amazing.  The greatest thing I have ever done in my career and been a part of.
