 Q. Bubba, 7-under par 63 today. Please talk about that round. 
 BUBBA WATSON: It was a good round. I've got a little sickness right now, so I'm drugged up. I'm trying to take some allergy medicine. My allergies get real bad out here with the hay and last week with the hay, but I got it around, scraped it around. 
 Hopefully I'll get a top 20 by the end of the day. And it's looking good. I've been playing good the last few weeks, and it's just another good round, good solid round.

 Q. What can your round tell us about what the leaders may be facing in a few hours?
 BUBBA WATSON: Birdies. I mean if you're playing good, you can make putts. The greens are slow, so you can just ram your putts. 
 I left a lot of putts short this week. The greens are slow, so right now you can just ram putts in from 10 feet, 15 feet. You don't have an issue of going too far past. 

 Q. Bubba, I hope you're feeling better. We thank you for your time. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, man. 

 Q. Great round out there today. What happened? You grabbed the course pretty much by the throat, huh?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. It could be had. You know, the golf course is soft. The greens are slow, so you can putt good. There's no tricks out there. You can hit a lot of fairways, you can hit a lot of greens. 
 I missed one green today, made a bogey on that hole. You know, I'm one of the first off, so it's top 20 for me, but for the leaders it's going to be a lot of birdies out there, or can be a lot of birdies.

 Q. You pretty much just dialed in with the irons all day today?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. All week. I've been playing pretty well. Today I made some putts and didn't make any mistakes. 

 Q. You had a T6 here last year. You pretty much like this course?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. Me and Hunter Mahan. No, it's a good course. It's a fair course. It's not too difficult. The rough's not up too much. The course is always soft. Greens are always a little bit slower, so you can make putts. 

 Q. Last year you went from here to Buick, finished T2 there. You kind of use this maybe, especially today as a springboard for the rest of the summer?
 BUBBA WATSON: I guess. You know, I've been playing good all year, been pretty consistent all year and just looking forward to the rest of the year doing that.
