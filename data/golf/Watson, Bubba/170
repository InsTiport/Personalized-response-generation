Q. Your son Caleb is clearly a Seattle fan.  Yesterday we talked and you said you needed to get the putter to cooperate and you'd have a chance.  Seemed like it did on the front 9.  Back 9 maybe not so much.BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, you know, a couple of shots here and there.  You know, 17, three-putted but I had, I don't know, 80-footer.  So that's a tough, tough two-putt there for birdie. And then the par-5.  I just didn't hit my tee shot well enough to have a chance to go for that green on -- what hole was that?  15.  So all in all, it was a great day.  It was a good challenge.  I don't see anybody bogeying, but I will accept it being a new week.Q. 14-under today.  Obviously last year you came so close to winning this tournament.  Looks like one or two shots' difference?BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure.  I don't see anybody bogeying.  Beautiful day out there.  Guys are playing great.  Two guys making bogeys, I don't see it.Q. Highlights from your round.  12?BUBBA WATSON: I have hit that bunker three times this week.  I got up and down every time.  To see it go in, that was a big boost.  I just couldn't do anything after that.Q. (Question about Caleb playing golf.)BUBBA WATSON: Same thing.  We live by the driving range, so he's hitting balls in the afternoon right before dinner.  He loves it, and so I just let him have fun.  I'm not gonna bug him.  Let him play golf and have fun with it.Q. 13.  Gets you into tie for the lead.BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, we had 253 I think is what my caddie said, 3-iron, and I flew it all the way to the hole.  I didn't expect to fly it all the way to the hole, but it did. Another thing, I hit a great shot in there.  Just missed the putt.  Hit a pretty good putt here, easy birdie.  But again, like I said, really nothing after that.  I really couldn't get any good birdie chances.Q. Are you enjoying golf more than you ever have?BUBBA WATSON: It's because of my son, my son, and now my daughter who is 10 weeks old.  When you look at it, it's just a sport.  We play a great game.  I'm blessed.  I have won a few times, won a couple of majors.  I'm blessed to do this. It's fun.  I'm going back to being a kid and just having fun with it.Q. If only that putter had cooperated over the last 36 holes?BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, it was good playing.  The driver's working really good right now.  The irons are always pretty good. It's just making a few putts.  You know, at the start of the week, I'd be happy just having a chance on Sunday, but, you know, when it gets push comes to shove, we always want a little bit more.Q. And the round, birdies, the one on 12 must have been special?BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure.  I hit that three times this week.  I'm starting to know that sand pretty good.  Holed it out and made that much more, I guess, that much better.Q. You have to be happy -- you probably feel like you may come up a buck shy.  Caleb is more interested in going home right now.  You must be happy with the way the game is trending.BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure.  I haven't played that much in the last few months, but I know I'm working on the right things.  My attitude is in the right spot.  My mental game is in the right spot.  It's looking good for another great year.
