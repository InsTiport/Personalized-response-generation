 Q.   A lot of power in that group today obviously between you and Dustin.   Did he have a little more power than you or just a little more shot‑making?   
BUBBA WATSON:   He just made putts.   Everybody can play on this golf course.   The fairways are wide.   Greens are big.   Comes down to making putts.   And if you look, Steve Stricker is right there beside him; he can make some putts.   There's a lot of guys that can putt really well.   
I didn't make any putts, but he made a lot of putts today.   He hit a lot of great shots and that's why he's I think 11‑under.   Just played his golf ball really well.   
   
 Q.   Here you were thinking it would take a Tommy Two Gloves kind of 60 to catch him tomorrow; do you really feel that?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   Unless this wind gets crazy again but the way he's playing it, the way he's striking it, the way he's controlling his golf ball, it's pretty good right now, and I don't see any different tomorrow for him.  
   
 Q.   Why do you think he's so good in 54‑hole events?   
BUBBA WATSON:   Who?   
   
 Q.   Dustin.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Oh, is he?   
   
 Q.   He's won two.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Obviously he doesn't like to play 72 I guess (chuckling).
