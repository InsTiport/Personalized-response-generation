   BUBBA WATSON: Got lucky. That's all it was.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. You know what, all week I hit some shots that were pretty bad. Chipped out of the bunker for par yesterday. 
 So I mean there was a lot of bad shots. Just have to go to the 17th hole and have a chance to win, but I stayed strong and made a birdie and I got a chance. I mean I could still lose, but right now best chance I got.
