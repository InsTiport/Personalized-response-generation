Q.   Bubba, a weird week got a whole lot weirder midway in your round when Tiger walked over and shook your hand.   What did it feel like playing by yourself coming down there? 
BUBBA WATSON:   It felt good.   I birdied.   I guess I made a putt, or I just lied and said I made a birdie. 
It was a weird week the whole week.   Playing with Tiger the last two days, day and a half, you know, it's good, and the shot on 2 is where I think he might have tweaked it a little bit. 
I didn't see it because I was watching his ball, but they said he jumped back in the bunker, fell in the bunker, and then hitting out of the rough a few times is just going to make the strain on the back a bit more. 
Hopefully, he recovers good and gets to playing good, and he'll be ready for next week.

Q.   Did he say anything to you when he shook your hand? 
BUBBA WATSON:   No, I told him I was praying for him.   I know he's going through tough times with his back and body.   So I told him I was going to pray for him.

Q.   How about your game going into next week?   I feel like you had some really sharp moments this week but didn't quite get to put it all together. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, I like the momentum putts.   I made some putts today that kept the momentum going.   The first three days, I didn't make the putts that I need to make to keep the momentum going. 
Hit a lot of good quality shots that spun off the green.   Today I had some that spun away from the hole.   I think the greens might be a little firmer next week.   So I'm looking forward to it. 
The driver's working really good.   So work on the putts a little bit.   Hopefully, the green's a little bit faster so I can get into the hole.   And just hit some more quality shots like I was doing.

Q.   And luckily you didn't have to play the back nine by yourself, so that was good. 
BUBBA WATSON:   It was strange.   I had a onesome in front of me and I was a onesome.   So it worked out great so we could join up.
