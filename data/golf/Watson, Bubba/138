Q. I'm here with Bubba Watson.  Bubba, if I had to put a caption and a picture on your round today, I guess it would be frustrating.BUBBA WATSON: For sure.  I thought I hit a lot of good shots, a lot of good putts.  Last hole, I think I'm the only one who missed it right.  I watched this morning and watched a lot of people miss to the left.  My ball decided to go right. I thought I hit a great shot, two great shots on -- what is that, 17.  Down the middle and then onto the green, but came up short somehow downwind.  Just a guessing today.  Still not bad.  1-under is not bad.Q. You drove the ball beautifully.  If you drive the ball like that tomorrow, you're obviously going to give yourself some opportunities.  What's it going to take from the tee shot in for you to be able to maybe get toward the winner's circle tomorrow?BUBBA WATSON: Just trust in everything and believe it's going to do what I think it's going to do.  And I've got to make putts.  The key around this golf course is making putts.  If you can make all your putts inside ten feet, you've got a chance.  That's what it's showing on the leaders are putting pretty good.Q. We've got tomorrow and that's most important, but we're going back to Whistling Straits, where you lost in the playoff last time.  How does your game feel to you right now going into next week?BUBBA WATSON: It feels good.  Again, it's the same thing.  If I hit my driver well and make putts, that's what I've got to do.  That's what I did that year, 2010, so if I could do that again, it will be a good week.
