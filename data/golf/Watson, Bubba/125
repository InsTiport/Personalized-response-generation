 Q.  Every half point counts.  You got a half point.  I know you wanted to get a full point, but certainly that was the difference.  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, when you look at it -- after the fact when you look at it, obviously it's great.  As long as you don't lose.   
Obviously I had a couple putts, couple matches where I could have won on 18 and won the match.  At the same time, it's not a loss.  We get something out of it.  It's a good feeling after the fact.   
 Q.  How difficult was that shot that you hit down that was...  
BUBBA WATSON: It was very difficult.  I hit a great shot, and then Teddy had the putt read right and I said, I just can't see it going that way.  I he said, All right.   
I missed it.  I already told Teddy he had a bunch good reads this week, and I just couldn't execute.   
 Q.  Now that you've played in several of these now or a bunch of these, have you learned you how compose and handle yourself?  After you missed it obviously you were upset, but you handled it really well.  
BUBBA WATSON: The key here, like you said, this whole event, all these events are about growing the game golf.  At the end of the day, I'm not mad at any of those guys.   
J.D. is one of the nicest guys in the world.  Nicest guys to play with.  He tied me today.  He played a great match.  Yeah, you can't get mad that.  If you do, then I got other things I need to work on.
