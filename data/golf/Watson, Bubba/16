BUBBA WATSON: You're going to make some bogeys.  I just didn't make enough birdies.  I hit it in the bunker on the last hole, I ended up shooting 1-over.  Not too bad.  But a couple of shots better.  Looks a lot better on the scorecard than 1-over.   
 Q.  Talk about the greens, what were you struggling with on the greens?  
BUBBA WATSON: I just didn't make any putts.  Didn't really get any on the greens close enough to make.  And I missed two short ones.  One I thought was going to break hard to the left, stayed dead straight.  And then on 16 there, we thought it had to fall slightly to the right and it felt like it went to the left.  Just two of them we just didn't -- either my stroke or we didn't read them right.   
 Q.  How do you describe the atmosphere?  
BUBBA WATSON: Perfect.  You couldn't ask for better -- the weather somehow held off for us.  But the crowds are perfect.  Anytime you come over here they understand the golf and enjoy it.  It's a beautiful part of the world.   
I was over here 22 years ago.  It's nice coming back and seeing it, and looking at this beautiful weather we've had recently over here.
