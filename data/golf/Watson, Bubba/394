 Q. Did you get everything out of it today or leave anything out there?
 BUBBA WATSON: You always leave stuff out there, no matter how good you shoot. Camilo left one out there yesterday. I'm not happy with the way I played, not happy with the way I played yesterday. I'm hitting the ball really well, played great at the start of the year, and just leaving one round or two rounds out there every week. Hopefully this weekend I can step up and grind it out and play well. 

 Q. Conditions changed moment to moment it seemed today. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, you're starting off on a par-5 and the wind is coming straight at you and the rain is coming straight at you, so it's kind of hard to barely make 5 there. And then I can drive that next hole, but with that rain it's not easy. So I kind of calmed down after the weather went away and finished strong.

 Q. What are you looking forward to as we get into the weekend?
 BUBBA WATSON: Not being 20 back. I'm only a handful back right now and I'm looking forward to battling it out on a tough golf course.

 Q. What's the deal, just try to chip away tomorrow and make a little bit of a run on Sunday?
 BUBBA WATSON: No, I'm not trying to chip away, I'm trying to get the whole thing any day. I don't care what day it is, get my first win somehow. Really just looking for a good tournament, just week by week, just getting better and better, and hopefully in the long run it turns out great. 

 Q. The rain, the wind, what was the hardest part?
 BUBBA WATSON: It was tougher than normal. The North Course usually lets go a lot of low scores. We had one 9-under out there, but today was a little tougher. Some of the easier holes we started off at were into the rain, and it makes it a little bit harder to make birdies. But all in all, it was good. It got better as the weather is getting better now. But I left a few out there, but at least I gained some ground and I still have a chance this weekend.

 Q. Those greens are pretty spongy. Does that make it a little more difficult?
 BUBBA WATSON: Every year they're spongy on that side, the North side, no matter if it's raining or not. It's always just tough putting, but you're going to hit a lot of greens on the North Course so you're going to make some here and there. I feel like I shot 4-under and didn't play that well.

 Q. Tomorrow you go to the South Course, does that make it easier do you think?
 BUBBA WATSON: No, the rough with the wet conditions is going to be stickier and stickier so it's going to be harder to get your club through it, so fairways are going to be a premium. The greens are going to be softer, yes, but if your club can't get through it, it doesn't matter.

 Q. Do you think your distance gives you an advantage if the course softens up a little bit?
 BUBBA WATSON: It always gives you an advantage, but it also gets you in trouble, so it works both ways. My putter is the one I want to do good. If I can putt well I'll have a great shot.

 Q. I know Camilo does a pretty good impersonation of Tiger and is tough to catch. 
 BUBBA WATSON: He's always tough to catch. He's a great player. He won two at the very end last year, so you know he's riding on a good, positive note and he's not afraid of anybody right now.
