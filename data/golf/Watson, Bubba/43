Q. Talk about your round a little bit today.
BUBBA WATSON: It was good.  I started off with a birdie on 10, a birdie on 11, missed a short one on 12.  But getting out with a couple birdies early made the round feel a lot better.  Got into a flow of the round.  Made a couple mistakes here and there, but all in all it was a good day.
Q. Your game's in good shape coming in here.  What are your expectations after seeing the way the course is playing?
BUBBA WATSON: The golf course is the best shape we have ever seen it.  We all say that.  Never seen it this good.  My best finish is 37th, so I'm -- every time I come here I'm just trying to beat 37.  I'm no good around this place.  It's very difficult for me because of the sights off the tee, some of the trees.  It makes me fear hitting the shots that I want to hit so it causes me a lot of problems.
Q. Couple of the guys earlier in the week talked about how playing this course -- I think Jordan may have talked about it, playing this course the way it's meant to be played is almost a must.  Like you can't fit a square peg into a round hole.  Do you adjust at all your approach then knowing as you say it kind of plays against your style?
BUBBA WATSON: I'm not very good adjustor I guess because again my best finish is 37th.  And I haven't made that many cuts around here.  It's very difficult for me because of the sights off the tee.  There's -- I can name a bunch of trees that are in my way just the way -- it might not be in my way, but it makes me feel like it is, so I can't hit the shots and I just don't see the shot that I want to hit.  So it makes it very difficult for me.  Nothing wrong with the golf course, the golf course is, I always say it's one of the best we ever play, it's just not built for me.
Q. What did you think about the way D.J. played today?
BUBBA WATSON: I think D.J. plays amazing all the time.  He's got that new putter in the bag, he stroked it well, I mean to be No. 1 in the world you got to stroke it pretty nice.  He's obviously a freak when it comes to physical strength and everything, talent for the game of golf is amazing.  So every time you play with him you look at something and learn something.
