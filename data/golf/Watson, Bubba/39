Q. Bubba, what's the mindset going in tomorrow with Paul so many shots out in front?
BUBBA WATSON: You've got to just play golf and hopefully you have a good one.  My 7-under yesterday, I need to do better than that.  I'm going to have to get to like 10.  If the weather's better than this, a little bit better, then the guys are going to make birdies.  As we've seen around this golf course, guys are going to make birdies.
The only beauty is, you know, getting out in front, you have a chance to put a number up and then maybe scare them.  But to scare them, you're going to have to shoot 10-under at worst, where I'm at anyway.
Q. Lost a couple at the end there, what happened?
BUBBA WATSON: Bad golf.  Missed the par putt and then missed the other par putt, and then tapped in for bogey.  Bad decision on the par-3, and then very tough tee shot for me on 17, and it just creeped into the bunker.  Just that's golf.  You have mistakes every once in a while.
Q. When you birdie the first hole and you think it's going to start rolling along and then (inaudible)?
BUBBA WATSON: No, I mean, you can't focus on what it's good to do at the end of the round.  You have to focus on each hole.  How difficult No. 4 is playing this week, you know, I hit a good shot on 3, hit a good second shot on 3, and I still had a 35-footer.  So I got No. 4, I was just trying to make par, got to the par-3, just trying to make par.
You're not really focused on that you're starting out birdie, birdie.  You're focusing on each hole at a time.  Then if you're doing then you're doing what everybody tells you you should be doing which is focus on the one shot at a time.
