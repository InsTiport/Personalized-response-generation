 Q.  Birdie-birdie finish --  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, it's nice.  I was telling some other guys that I was 2-under before the rain and I was 1-over during the rain and then 2-under after the rain.  I need it not to rain.  It was a good way to finish.  Going down 17, you want to get one more birdie.  You knew that there was a couple birdies going on on 18, so I got lucky, made the putt on 17, and then hit it close and made the putt on 18.  I was trying to get one and snuck out with two.   Q.  Did you go driver-driver on 17?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, driver-driver.  I had 298 hole, and so tried to hit driver.   Q.  Pretty soft fairways, it stopped everything, didn't it?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, the tee shots aren't going as far as they normally go here.  There's a little bit of breeze into us and it was wet conditions.   Q.  I heard some of the golfers talk about momentum and that's obviously something every golfer deals with.  You're kind of dealing with a little bit of negative momentum until the end here.  How do you overcome that?  BUBBA WATSON: Well, if you look at it, you're looking at it a different way.  I'm looking at it as more positive.  I hit a 7-iron that shot way to the right on -- we'll say 13.  I think it's 13.  And then I got this unbelievable up-and-down, so that was momentum.  You know, could have had a worse lie on 14 after hitting it in the rough and didn't.  Had a beautiful putt on -- six-footer on 15 to save my round.  So it was more of a positive than I'd say negative.  You know, any time you can make pars in a PGA TOUR event, you're not really losing too much. So that's what I did, and I hung on, and then that positive energy, that little bit of positive energy that I had helped me make two birdies finishing there.   Q.  You talked a little bit about fatigue yesterday.  Do you feel that out there at all?  BUBBA WATSON: No, when you get to the first tee here, you get jittery, you get excited, you get pumped up.  I was 100 percent.  I was ready to go right when I stepped on that tee.   Q.  When you see the numbers that came in in the morning, you get 67 in the afternoon, you're going back in the morning, do you feel like okay, I'm fine?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, I think I'm fine.  Again, I haven't looked at the weather.  Starting today I knew the weather was going to be iffy for us this afternoon, and then all day tomorrow, so I haven't looked again.  I don't know if it's cleared up or if it's still iffy for us.  So I'm hoping it clears up for us for at least nine holes and then get like it was.
