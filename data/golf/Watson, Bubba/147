Q. Kind of off to a rough start but you got it back at the end again today.BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, no rain on the 10th hole, my first hole, made a birdie, and then the umbrella came out and I struggled again, just like yesterday.  I shot, I think, 1-over in the time that I had the umbrella in my hand, shot 2-over today during the time I had the umbrella in my hand, and every time it was not raining I made birdies. Strong finish again today, just like yesterday, so looking forward to the weekend.  Hopefully the weather clears up but not until tomorrow.  I hope today it struggles.  I hope it's raining again.Q. You afternoon-morning guys had the worst of the weather, obviously.  Sometimes it just breaks that way, right?BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, you never know.  Teeing off at -- I don't know what the first tee time was today, 7:00, and then the last tee time at 1:30, 2:00, you're going to have different weather, different conditions, and so it's just one of those things.  This week I got on the opposite draw -- or right now we don't know.  It could get worse.  But right now it seems like the opposite draw, the draw you don't want to be on.Q. On 12, they ended up having to roll the greens.  Looked like y'all got frustrated with that.BUBBA WATSON: Well, it was just raining so hard, so you're wondering why we're out there raining that hard, because it's tough, and I just three-putted, so I was frustrated no matter what.  They could have said, Bubba, you can redo it, I still would have been mad about it. For me, I thought because the rain was building up down there, I thought my putt was going to be a ton slower.  It raced past, so obviously it didn't slow it down.  Maybe it hydroplaned.  So a quick three-putt there, one of my bogeys.  I bogeyed both par-5s today, which was not very fun for me.Q. Talk about what went into the decision to paint your car.BUBBA WATSON: I was waiting for that question.Q. Well, you Tweeted it --BUBBA WATSON: First of all, I was surprised -- I've already told ESPN this.  I just did them back there.  But I was surprised that nobody until now has asked me about it, knowing that I have the Lee I, first General Lee ever produced.  It was a great show.  I love the show.  Still a fan of the show.  There was no racism in the show that I can remember.  Me and my dad, me and my family used to watch it, and who doesn't want a car that jumps, so I'm still a huge fan of -- I'm still a huge fan of the car. Obviously I love the show, but the flag is offensive to people, and enough buzz, I felt like it was the right gesture for me to do, and so I don't stand for hatred, and so I think we're all equal, we're all created equal, like I said in my Tweet.Q. In all the time that you've owned that car, has anyone ever remarked to you on that?BUBBA WATSON: When I first bought it.  You know, there's always going to be people that -- like I've said before, 50 percent of the world is going to like me, 50 percent is going to hate me, or maybe a little less.  10 percent could care less who I am. You know, that's why I don't drive it.  Once people start putting hatred on it, I don't want to be involved in that.  So it hasn't been out of my garage with the flag on it.  It hasn't been out -- I took it to the shop because I let the battery run down so I had to get the battery fixed, but they wheeled it in and off the truck.  That was the only day that it's been seen in the public since -- gosh, since a couple years now.Q. But you didn't buy it to have it just sit in your garage.BUBBA WATSON: No, I bought it just like a trophy.  I mean, it jumped six days after I was born.  It's a beautiful car.  It's actually made of metal, you know, when cars were really nice back then.  And so it's a -- when you look at the history behind the car, the TV show, I don't see that there's anything wrong with the TV show.  Obviously the flag is the controversy, not the show, and so for me, I bought, I thought, American history.Q. Will you just paint it orange then?BUBBA WATSON: No I'm going to put the flag on it, United States flag.  I mean, it's American history.  The car itself and then the TV show itself, so why not -- I thought the basic statement would be put the United States flag on there, that they're all created equal.Q. Have you been reading in the newspaper about what's been happening in the church?BUBBA WATSON: No, I have not.  I don't look at any media because there's a lot of negative towards me and a lot of positive towards me, so I don't want to be too high and I don't want to be too low.Q. But you knew about the flag controversy?BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, my manager keeps up with everything.  He texted me and said, we might need to do something, and I said, well, I'm trying to win a golf tournament.  This was last week.  I said, I'm trying to win a golf tournament now.  Let's worry about it -- I said, but no media has talked to me about it yet, so until he mentioned it to me, I had no clue.
