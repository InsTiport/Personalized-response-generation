  Q. Presidents Cup, Royal Melbourne, U.S. on the board again with the first point of the afternoon, when I watch you out there, it looks to me the interaction between you two, you keep believing in yourselves regardless whether you hit a bad shot or not.   
 BUBBA WATSON: This game, it's so difficult but for me and him bumper to bumper but definitely. This game, it's so difficult. But for me and him, the thing about it, we are enjoying it. Who knows how many Presidents Cup we are going to play in. Me and him being good friends and being Christians and believing what we believe, we are having fun out here and we know it's a blessing to be here.  
  
  Q. You've gone out first in every session, is there a sense of responsibility going out in that position?   
 WEBB SIMPSON: We like to get going early and we don't like to wait around a lot in the morning and it's nice to try to put up the first point for our team and get them going on. It's nice to have been able to do that.
