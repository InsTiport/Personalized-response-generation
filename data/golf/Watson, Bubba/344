 Q. Some people say that between golf technology, golf ball technology the game's getting too long. As one of the longest hitters on TOUR do you agree with them and what would you do to shorten it up a little bit. 
 BUBBA WATSON: You got to remember that we're selling products to amateurs and weekend golfers, we're not selling to pros. So if you think of all sports -- I'm not disagreeing with what he's saying, but if you look at all sports we're not changing rims, we're not changing the football field, the only thing we're changing is the golf courses, we're making it longer. 
 And I think that's taking away -- there's less pros in the world than there are regular golfers, so I think we're doing it the wrong way. 
 The test of golf, Augusta's held up pretty good. They tried to change a few holes. Colonial's held up pretty good. Hilton Head's held up pretty good. So there's no reason to change it. 
 We're going to play good, there's going to be better golfers, so we're going to shoot 30-under some times, we're going to shoot 20-under sometimes, just let us shoot it. There's no reason to change it. 
 Look, we're selling it to amateurs, we're making it more fun to grow the game for amateurs, not pros. 

 Q. Speaking of amateurs can you talk about Lion Kim and playing with him?
 BUBBA WATSON: It was good. A very nice kid, very young kid, he swung it really well. We were all hitting wedges, but he's doing good. It's great to see him out here. It's great to see all the amateurs be able to play in this. So, no, it was very good. 

 Q. As a former collegiate golfer did you give him any advice out there?
 BUBBA WATSON: I told him, don't worry about it, it's tough, especially your first time. I mean, it's a hard golf course, it's a fast golf course, it's just stuff that you don't realize how tough it really is.
