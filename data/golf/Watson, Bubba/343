 Q. If you could just describe your round for us, please. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Describe my round? 

 Q. Please. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Terrible. Next question? 
 It was a rough day. Wasn't quite sure where the ball was going. Didn't really have any control over it. The greens tricked me a little bit. They were a little bit slower than I was expecting, so I just never got anything going, never got any momentum going, so it was just a rough day out there.

 Q. Is your back okay?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, back is great, just tweaked it when I snap-hooked the shot off the first tee. I pulled a little something. My trainer said it just started spasming, so he finally got there and worked on it a little bit. It was good coming in, never had a problem.

 Q. Are you going to have to go in for anything?
 BUBBA WATSON: At my house. He stays with me.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, you know, it was close. I just never had any momentum, made a quick double, missed a three-footer on another hole, made a bogey on 2 where you should birdie. So it was there, it's just no momentum. Tomorrow if I come out and birdie the first hole, first the second hole, momentum changes and you get some of it back.
