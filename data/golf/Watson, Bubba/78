Q. Is it fair to say that the ball striking is where it was yesterday for you?
BUBBA WATSON: Yes, it was.  It was really nice.  We tweaked the whatever you call it, where the ball position was.  So it was really nice.  It's nice to know where the balls are going, especially with this wind like this.  It's gusty right now.
Q. With that wind, what are the guys going to face this afternoon?  It's supposed to be even more.
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, I know.  I can't wait to watch it.  Let's see what hole that is, 11, 12, 13.  13 green, putting on that right now is so difficult and we're the first group out.  If it gets tougher, 13 will be a crazy hole to watch on coverage.
