  BUBBA WATSON:   Play good golf.   Get a top‑5 and still try to compete on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   This many holes, is it important in the round when you're 2‑over par to get back?   Is that important to you?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure, because of the fact I was 5 over for the day.   Birdied 9 and missed a short putt on 10.   But I just kept fighting.   I birdied two of the tougher holes on the course, especially 15.   I just kept grinding away.   I wasn't mad at my situation, I was just trying to improve, you know.   
So that's what you have to do is fight for the little goals.   The big goals weren't working, so the little goals you have to start with.  
   
 Q.   Sunday they're expecting maybe 30 miles an hour wind; that can affect your round in a hurry?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   It's one of those things, this golf course, right now we haven't had any wind the last two days, so there's a lot of low scores.   Yeah, when the wind blows here it's easy to start getting off track real quick.   Pars and birdies are really good.   And pars are really good, too.  
   
 Q.   Are you amazed how low the scores are?   
BUBBA WATSON:   No, it's soft.   When you're playing good golf you can score around here.   And so I can see it.   I don't want to see it, because I'm even.   But, yeah, I can see people do it.   Yeah, for sure.
