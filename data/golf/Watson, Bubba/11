 Q.  Nice finish out there today. How did that putt at 18 not go in? I saw you looking at me, it looked like you hit it absolutely perfect, it just didn't drop.  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure, and all I wanted to do was beat Justin Thomas, that's all I looked at, I saw I was tied with him and so I really wanted that putt to go in, just so I could text him. But I hit a great putt -- I hit a couple good putts today that didn't go in, but all in all you'll take the week and take the putting stroke, it looked pretty good this week.   
 Q.  With the wind and the firmness of the greens it got a little challenging out there, didn't it?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, number 11 and No. 12 -- 14, is always a goofy hole, a tough hole -- but 11 and 12 were two of the toughest I've ever seen out here because of conditions.   
 Q.  I know you're a big sports fan who do you like in the Super Bowl tonight?  
BUBBA WATSON: I really want Mahomes to do well. I just think he's a special talent, it's been fun to watch him. So I love seeing creativity, that's how I kind of think of my golf game, so it be would fun to see him do some heroics.   
 Q.  Could you just tell me about the crowds this week, not just on 16 but throughout the tournament and how it compares to previous years?  
BUBBA WATSON: No, it's growing, it's growing tremendously. I think that they have created an atmosphere, the Thunderbirds have created an atmosphere, the city is really behind it, Phoenix and Scottsdale, you can't ask for better crowds. When people come out here and support you, this many people, I mean this has got to be one of or the biggest sporting event in the world, the amount of people that come through the gates over a seven-day period or whatever it is, pretty amazing.
