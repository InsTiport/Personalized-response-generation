 Q.  If you can just assess the week for us, please.  
BUBBA WATSON: The week was okay.  At the end of the day I think I tied 13th, unless something happens, but top 15 is good.  But the way I went about it was a struggle, and today this was like a U.S. Open.  I've never seen this course this difficult.  Around the greens, on the greens, as firm as they were, as slick as they were, this was a U.S. Open-type of golf course today.  It was pretty difficult out there.  For me, I was having trouble getting everything just right.   
 Q.  What Kevin did, Bubba, is pretty special.  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, if you look, again, it's easy to look at Kevin's score compared to everyone else's, but these guys are so good.  You're always going to have a guy come out of the pack.  But if you look at the early rounds, there are a lot of 63s and 64s, so it's two different golf courses.  Kind of like the U.S. Open, from Saturday morning to Saturday afternoon, it's two different golf courses at the U.S. Open, so same thing here.  You can see the difference.   
But Kevin just stepped up, played good golf, hit quality shots.  Obviously, he must have made a lot of putts, unless he chipped in a lot.
