 Q.  4-under, I know you were 4-under at the turn.  How would you assess your round today?  
BUBBA WATSON: I think I was 3-under at the turn.  I might have signed the wrong scorecard.  But anyway, it's a good day.   
I have to give it up to my wife.  Our family has been under the weather and she took care of me the last couple of days.  I was in the bed from 1:30 until I woke up this morning around 10.  So, 1:30 yesterday afternoon.  So I've been in the bed for awhile.  Just a lot of medicine that's legal medicine on the TOUR here.  So she's been taking care of me.  She's the one that got me around today.  I think it is my first time shooting in the 60s in the first round on this course.  So it was a good day for me.   
 Q.  What was going wrong with the family?  The sickness?  
BUBBA WATSON: Just the kids got sick when we were at the Hero Challenge.  And then I went to Thailand and when I got back the kids had been sick.  The little girl had pink eye, two ear infections and then it's just kind of transferred over to us.  So my wife's been an angel in helping me prepare for this week.   
 Q.  Feeling better today, though?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, today, obviously shooting in the 60s for the first time in my first round obviously helps me out a lot.
