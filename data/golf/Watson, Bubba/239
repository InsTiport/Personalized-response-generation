  BUBBA WATSON:   I left a lot of putts out there, but 7‑under after two rounds is going to be Top‑10, Top‑5, somewhere in there by the end of the day, so it's nice.   
   
 Q.   You got it going nicely on the back nine.   
BUBBA WATSON:   I made a double on No. 10, a quick double after being in the middle of the fairway, but then I made some good putts, some good quality shots, and finished up strong.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you don't beat yourself up too much about it, because there's so long to go in the tournament.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, we've still got two more days.   Two more days, a lot could happen.   I could be dead last by the end of the week.   Right now I'm just taking it with stride and hopefully come out and make some putts and hit the ball just as could.  
   
 Q.   What do you reckon to Sheshan and this course?   
BUBBA WATSON:   Do what now?   
   
 Q.   What do you reckon to this course here?   
BUBBA WATSON:   I think it's good.   There's a couple holes that are tricky, a couple greens that are tricky.   But it's fair.   But every golf course you play is going to have one or two bad holes.  
   
 Q.   Is it any different to playing in the United States coming over here and playing in China, different atmosphere?   
BUBBA WATSON:   No, it's about the same.   I just don't hear much English.   But it's about the same.   Good golf course, fast greens, and great shape.   
   
 Q.   I take it you'll enjoy it if it's busy at the weekend as it's likely to be?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, it would be nice.   But everything about the trip so far has been beautiful; going to Malaysia last week and then here, it's perfect.
