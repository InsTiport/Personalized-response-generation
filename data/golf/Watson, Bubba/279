Q.   Bubba, you spoke earlier this week about the emotion of this Ryder Cup, the first since your dad passed away, and that was the last time he saw you play golf.   What's running through your veins right now? 
BUBBA WATSON:   It's been an amazing ride.   Since my dad has been gone I've played some good golf, I've won a major, got a son, now I'm in the Ryder Cup again.   Just playing with a buddy that can keep me cool, know he's going to play really good.   For me, I just needed to be in there when he was what we call struggling, making pars, so it was fun.   But obviously what this means to me and the United States flag and my dad not being here, it's just wild.
