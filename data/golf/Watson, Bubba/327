 Q. Obviously very disappointed things haven't worked out for you this week. You came here in such fabulous form, two wins this year. What's been the problem?
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, it's different. It's not a normal tournament. It's just different for me. There's cameras, there's phones, there's everything. No security. I don't know which holes to walk through. There's no ropes. It's just different. I'm not used to that. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying it's something I'm not used to, I'm not comfortable with. It's very strange to me just very uncomfortable.

 Q. We see a lot of cameras on the course at U.S. tournaments. Why is it that different then?
 BUBBA WATSON: We don't see any cameras like this. There's phones, there's video cameras, and every tee says, no phones, no video cameras and on every tee there's hundreds. So it's just different.

 Q. Yesterday you told us you this might be your only trip across. Please tell us you're going to change your mind, because your fans want to see you playing more in Europe and around the world. 
 BUBBA WATSON: I'll play the British because it's a Major. That's the only reason. 

 Q. Scandinavian Masters, you were intending to play. I think you're not going to do that now?
 BUBBA WATSON: We'll see. A few weeks away. 

 Q. You told us you were missing home, is the plan now to get out of here as fast as you can? 
 BUBBA WATSON: No. I'm going to go sightseeing real quick and probably sightsee tomorrow, but probably get home as fast as possible.
