 Q.  Three straight 66s, you gave it one heck of a charge down the stretch.  BUBBA WATSON: I played solid all week.  Couple mistakes here and there like normal, but it was solid.  It was very solid. I'm looking good going to forward for the rest of the year.  I turned it around.  I thought I was hitting the ball really good, and then finally, I proved that I was.  A pretty good finish this week.   Q.  If you would remove the putting from this week, I think you would have won by 15 shots.  You hit the ball so good we just couldn't get the lid to open it seemed like?  BUBBA WATSON: For sure.  You're going to have weeks like that.  And I'll take it.  It's one of those things where I had a shot.  The last hole I had a divot holding my ball up. But, still hit a pretty good iron shot in there and had a chance to scare him, but missed it.  But I'll take it.  Second place is a start in the right direction.   Q.  More importantly, the FedExCup points you get puts you in the top-5, so you control your destiny.  BUBBA WATSON: For sure.  Maybe that's when I make my putts.  That would be nice to make them there.  10 million bucks worth of putts wouldn't be too bad.   Q.  Solid round again and a really strong weekend.  BUBBA WATSON: It was nice.  I started out slow in the tournament, but finished strong.  So, it's always something you're looking forward to, is how you finish. So, I had a chance on the last hole to scare him a little bit, but obviously I didn't make the putt and he played solid.   Q.  How does this propel you towards next week and then obviously the Ryder Cup?  BUBBA WATSON: Looking forward to it.  I thought I was hitting the ball pretty well the last couple months, and I missed some putts this week.  But all in all it was a great week.  I had some momentum on my side this week. I made some clutch putts, some clutch up-and-downs to keep the rounds going.  And that's what I've been looking for the last couple of months. So obviously, the rest of the year I've got about six more tournaments to go, and I'm looking forward to them.
