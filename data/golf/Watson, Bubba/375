  Q. Just talk a little about your round today and what you thought you did well?  
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, I just couldn't make my putts at first on the front nine. I made a bogey on the first hole, my only bogey of the day was on the first hole. I played solid, hit a lot of good shots, but you know, everybody on the leaderboard seemed like they were just playing unbelievable, a lot of low scores today. I just couldn't get anything going, but I shot 2-under, so I mean, I didn't play bad for a major championship. 2-under is good, but a lot of people played great today.  
  
  Q. Do you have a number in mind?  
 BUBBA WATSON: I'm going to go out and just try to play golf. If it's a low number like some of those guys shot today, then I have a shot at it. But it looks like Nick Watney is playing really good right now.  
 Basically just try to play as good as I can and hopefully the putts fall.  
  
  Q. What's it like going to bed tonight and have a normal day of golf tomorrow?  
 BUBBA WATSON: That's going to be great because hopefully I'll get to sleep in a little bit. My body is beat. I think everybody's body is beat out here. But to get a little extra rest would be great.
