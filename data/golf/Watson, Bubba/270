JULIUS MASON:   Joining us after the first9rst round of the PGA Grand Slam of golf, 33‑35, 68,‑3, it looks like you were having some fun out there today.   What were the weather conditions like, and give us some thoughts on your rounds today, please. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Any it was fun.   Anytime you can come to this event, it's fun.   Some of the caddies were looking for hole locations for this event; but it's like, this is fun right now, why are you working so hard. 
I had a couple tough shots out there, a few 3‑putts, not tracking very well on the greens; not comfortable on greens but other than, that 3‑under, can't get too mad at that.   The weather was perfect, the fans were great.   So, yeah, it was good. 

Q.   Could you focus through the approach shot on 15, which obviously was an interesting one. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Oh, I hit in the hazard.   Hit my tee shot, sliced it, hit in the hazard.   I couldn't ground the club because it was in the hazard.   I was hitting outside the had a ready Saturday was in, I hovered the club, punched down on it.   My caddie said we had about 130 yards, so punched down on it and came out perfect. 
Came out where the only difficult thing about the shot was just that I had to hover the club, and because of the rules, you can't ground the club in the hazard or move loose impediments, that was the only difficult thing about hitting the shot it was wide open, and somehow pulled it off and luckily made the putt.   It wasn't a good shot if you missed the putt. 
JULIUS MASON:   TNT Shot of the Day, by the way.
BUBBA WATSON:   I did something good today. 

Q.   The dogleg‑‑
BUBBA WATSON:   If you looked at it, there's probably about four holes where you hit a drive as far as you can, but then it roles back.   So that means length is not an advantage on this golf course.   It's about solid iron shots and making putts, and everybody's going to hit the fairways. 
The fairways are generous.   The length is not really‑‑ length is not really an advantage unless you hit it dead straight.   I've had that problem before where I've hit it crooked and it's not good.
JULIUS MASON:   Bubba, thank you very much for joining us.
