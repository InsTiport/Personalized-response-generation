 Q.   Finishing very strong on the end of the golf course, should bode well for tomorrow.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, I'm just hitting some good shots, and two par 5s, you know, a short hole, but 17 is going come down‑‑ it's going to be a tough one on 17 if it's into the winds again coming down the stretch.   But yeah obviously I've got some good confidence through those holes.  
   
 Q.   Drastic change in conditions.   How did it change the way the golf course played for you?  
BUBBA WATSON:   It made the golf course play a little bit longer just because of the ball wasn't going as far with the colder temperatures.   
   
 Q.   Are you a satisfied man with the way you closed out today?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yes, a couple 3‑putts today and a double‑bogey, that's sad.   But the birdies down the stretch really helped out, especially birdieing the last hole.   Makes dinner taste a lot better.  
   
 Q.   So much positives to concentrate on, can I take you back to the 8th, very nearly an albatross.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah but then I missed the putt, though, but let's don't bring that up.  
It was a great shot.   Yeah, it almost went in.   I could tell by the reaction of the crowd it almost went in.   That would be nice to make that putt, though.  
   
 Q.   It's exciting, isn't it, when that sort of thing happens really gets the juices flowing?  
BUBBA WATSON:   For sure.   I was in the round playing pretty good, and then I hit that shot, that much better, made an easy birdie there.   Hiccup on 10, missed a short one on 12 but the solid birdies down the stretch really helped out a lot.  
   
 Q.   I take it has not been easy this week, but in the weather‑‑  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, makes the golf course play a little longer.   With the irons, the ball is not traveling as far because it's cold.   It's a little different mind‑set and a little different‑‑ when you get a number, it might be more club than it was the day before.   
   
 Q.   Are you enjoying being in a foreign country like this?   I know you always have the mantra of spreading the word about golf, and getting it to different corners of the world.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure this is fun to be able to come over and travel and play golf, see some of the great golf courses.   But also see some of the different cultures, obviously this is fun for us to come over and try it out and try to show our skills to the world.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you've enjoyed playing in a final group with that many people around you?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   I think I just missed playing in the final group tomorrow, but obviously it was a good day and tomorrow I can hopefully improve.
