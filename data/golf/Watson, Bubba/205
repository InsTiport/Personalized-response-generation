  BUBBA WATSON:   This whole week I just haven't made the putts I wanted to make, momentum putts.   So I missed a few, had a three‑putt on number 8, the par‑3, I three‑putted.   I had a little hiccup there because I forgot they don't cut the greens the same way.   It's a lot slower than the other greens out here.   Just I was so into golf that I totally forgot they cut it differently.   No excuse, it's just I three‑putted so bad putt.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel behind the 8‑ball or do you think you can go on one of these runs and get a 9‑under, 7‑under?   
BUBBA WATSON:   You think you can do that, but it comes down to what they do.   If I don't play good and they play great, then there is no way to catch them.   It's a chance to learn from this.   In two weeks we have another major, so I'm going to come out and try to play some good golf and move up the leaderboard.   If I play really good golf, then maybe we'll sit around and see what we can do.  
   
 Q.   How frustrating was today?   It seemed like every time you made a birdie you followed that with a bogey.   
BUBBA WATSON:   The whole week has been frustrating.   It's been beautiful, perfect weather, a little windy but they're out here scoring, but I just didn't make the putts.   Hopefully tomorrow I'll make a few putts and move up the leaderboard and scare some people.
