Q.   An up‑and‑down second round for Bubba Watson.   Bubba, take me through your Friday here at TPC River Highlands.
BUBBA WATSON:   I just didn't have any putts.   I didn't make any good putts.   No. 1, I wasn't a three‑putt just off the green, missed a short one.   Three‑putted 16.   Bad swing trying to be a hero on the par‑5, 13. 
You know, it's a battle right now trying to make the cut, but you know, if I can make the cut, maybe the weekend I can do something special.

Q.   This is a place you're very comfortable at, you've had a lot of success at.   What have you been struggling with this week?
BUBBA WATSON:   I think just making putts.   I hit a good tee shot too far away from the hole or I hit a bad tee shot too far away from the hole, you know, so I haven't really got the ball close to the hole.   Normally I have a lot of wedges.   This week, I just my wedges haven't really been as sharp as I want them to be, so that makes a strain on my putting and right now that's what hurts me.   Make a few more putts, you know, we're in the cut or we're in the middle of the field there.

Q.   Right now you're right on the number.   Assuming you make it to the weekend, what's going to be your approach going to be for the final?
BUBBA WATSON:   It's just about trying to do the things I always do, be 100 percent committed, try to make some birdies, and really, when you barely make the cut you're not really thinking about winning unless you do something special on Saturday.   So come out here, just try to shoot maybe 5‑under, something like that and move up the leaderboard a little bit, maybe sneak in a Top 10 or something like that.

Q.   Maybe some flashbacks to Riviera?
