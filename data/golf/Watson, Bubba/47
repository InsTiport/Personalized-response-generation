 Q. How did you play today, Bubba?  
BUBBA WATSON: It was good. Obviously there's a lot of good scores today, we had the roars back that we always talk about Sunday afternoon. The wind was down so people were scoring pretty good. For me, I made a couple mistakes, silly mistakes. I think the back nine, the last few holes, I got it under par, I got it in the 60s, so it was a nice finish. But obviously I needed that start like Jordan had.   
   
 Q. Was it just good play on Jordan's part or was the course really setup to go low today?  
BUBBA WATSON: Well I mean it's a Major Championship so I don't if there's such a thing as, set up to go low. But it's just those roars. The golf course, when you're not leading, it's a different kind of pressure, so you can attack. And your mindset's different than around the top guys. With Jordan starting so far back, obviously he could attack. I think Cameron Smith shot a real low one, too. There was a few guys that shot a low one. You can see around the leaders it's a lot tougher to score, just because of pressure.   
   
 Q. The way you said you felt on Thursday how happy are you to get a Top‑5?  
BUBBA WATSON: Well right now it's a Top‑5, but it's a top‑10, no matter what, I think. So, yeah, I'm very happy. Like I said, number 13 on Thursday afternoon I hit a shot and I felt something positive and ever since then I think I shot three rounds in the 60s, right? I don't know what it adds up to, but I just know it was in the top‑10 somewhere. So, yeah, that's what I'm saying, ever since 13, I felt something, I got something positive and I was off and running after that.   
   
 Q. What's the most impressive thing about Patrick Reed?  
BUBBA WATSON: His intensity. He plays pretty much every week, we always joke about that in the locker rooms, to him and his family and stuff. But to do that over and over, week after week. Obviously we have seen how what a player he's been over the years, obviously in college he was a great player and now, but to see his intensity week after week‑‑ I can't do it, I don't have enough energy, I don't have the mindset, first of all and I don't have the energy to do it, it's pretty impressive to watch.
