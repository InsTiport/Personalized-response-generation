  Q. I'm standing here with Bubba. First of all, hard fought match out there.   
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, it's sad because I lost. But, you know, I played good. I didn't really mess up too much.   
 He just beat me. He made some putts that I didn't make and beat me 1-up, I guess they're going to say 2-up. I didn't putt out my last par on the last hole, so he beat me by 1. It was close.  
  
  Q. So much to be proud of. The birdie you made at 17 was world class?  
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, I hit that good. That's the thing, it showed a lot -- it showed that I can play golf.   
 The first match this morning, I was down 5 with 8 to play and somehow I won it. It shows that I can do it, I can bear down and fight to the end.
