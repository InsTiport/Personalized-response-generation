  Q. Well, 10 under par. Let me ask you this, Bubba. You just want to keep playing number 11? Play that one over and over again?   
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, that one was good for me. I hit two good shots. The second shot in there. The fairway and tee shot was a little scary for me but it worked out today.  
  
  Q. You can say scary with a little grin on your face because I don't think there is a tee shot out there that scares you very much. But tell me about this golf course. You played it in three different wind directions.   
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, it's tricky. You're not sure what the wind's doing on some holes. You've got tough tee shots out there. You have a lot of water you've got to watch out for.   
 So you're always watching and trying to see what's going on to figure out how to play the holes.  
  
  Q. Me and John were making a little fun of you earlier today because you said originally this is a golf course that you said doesn't really fit my eye. But somebody told you you better come over here and play, and you've got to do what mama tells you, right?   
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, mom knows best. Mom knew I was going to play pretty good the first two rounds. We've got two more to go, but she's right so far.  
  
  Q. After yesterday shooting 6-under par, when you left the golf course did she tell you, I told you so?   
 BUBBA WATSON: No, she said she was tired from walking in the heat. No, she didn't say anything like that?
