 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, the golf course yesterday was a little different. A lot of wind, getting dark, hard to see, but today we cam out here and we actually got good weather and a light breeze, so we could play golf today. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BUBBA WATSON: 1 and 2 play a little different when there's no wind and it's not dead into you. I hit some good tee shots in there and made some key putts. 

 Q. Do you feel like you left a lot out there?
 BUBBA WATSON: No. Any time you can shoot under par in a major you're doing all right, I think. 

 Q. How do you feel about your round after two days?
 BUBBA WATSON: I feel great. To shoot under par in the second round after two days is pretty good. 
 Yesterday the nine holes we played was really windy, it was getting dark, it was hard to see, and then today we had a light breeze and perfect weather, so it was doable today. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, definitely. The front nine I think is a little harder on the tee shots, but with no wind it's a little bit easier. And so I knew that I could, you could make some birdies out there, as long as you make sure you didn't make any others. And I held it together and made some birdies. 

 Q. How aggressive were you able to be? Do you like to be aggressive in these conditions?
 BUBBA WATSON: You can be as aggressive as you want. So whatever you want to man up and do. But some holes you always play safe just to be safe.

 Q. What's the most difficult thing about a day like today where you got a few holes to play and then have to come back and play another 18? 
 BUBBA WATSON: Finding energy. Last night it was a short sleep, five and a half, six hours, and then back out again. So you got to just find your energy.
