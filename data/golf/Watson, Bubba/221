  CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Good evening.   I'm Billy Payne, Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club.   And I'm truly excited to be here in our famous Butler Cabin, along with my good friend Jim Nantz.  
JIM NANTZ:   Thank you, Billy.  
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Thank you, Jim, another great job.  
JIM NANTZ:   Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Jim and I will soon repeat the long standing tradition of the award of the Green Jacket to the Masters champion.   But before we do, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our television viewers across America and in over 200 countries around the world for your long‑term and loyal support of the Masters.   
I now welcome three very special gentlemen with wonderful smiles on their faces.   This year's low amateur, Mr.Oliver Goss.   Congratulations sir.  
OLIVER GOSS:   Thank you very much.  
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   2013 champion, Mr.Adam Scott.   Adam.   Good to see you, sir.   
And the 2014 Masters champion, Mr.Bubba Watson.   Bubba, congratulations.  
BUBBA WATSON:   Thank you very much.  
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Please have a seat, gentlemen.   I know Jim has a few questions.   
JIM NANTZ:   It was memorable, Billy.   Oliver, a nod to you, the amateur here of course such an important part of the history of this tournament.   What a week, celebrate your birthday, you make the cut, I know when you first came here back in February it was a little rough back then, wasn't it, tell us that story.   
OLIVER GOSS:   Yeah, I came down in November for my first practice rounds and then organized another trip down in February.   And it was just right when the huge storm hit.   That's when they took Ike's Tree out and I got snowed in for a couple of days.  
JIM NANTZ:   Couple of days and you also went through an earthquake, too.  
OLIVER GOSS:   That's right.   I was sitting in my hotel room and I felt the shake and the whole building was rumbling.  
JIM NANTZ:   What were you feeling with all the family that was out there supporting you?   
OLIVER GOSS:   I just felt very supported.   I had my entire family here and close friends and all the support on the course was amazing.   
JIM NANTZ:   An amazing performance by you.   Well done.   
Speaking of all the family, what a scene we just witnessed behind the 18th green.   Bubba, back in the seat for the second time in three years.   How did you do it out there today?   
BUBBA WATSON:   I really don't know.   I was telling my caddie coming up 18, I didn't, I don't remember the last few holes.   I just remember hanging on.   All I thought about was make pars and make pars.   Somehow I did and walking up 18 was a little bit easier this time.  
JIM NANTZ:   Yes, indeed.   I thought an important sequence happened on the front nine when you matched him with birdies on both of the par‑3s and then birdied the ninth on top of it to go to the second side with the lead.   Talk about that stretch.  
BUBBA WATSON:   He started out hot with a bunch of birdies.   Holed it from the bunker on 4.   Knocked it really close on 6.   
So for me to back it up and make birdies on top of him helped a lot, helped the momentum go my way a little bit.  
JIM NANTZ:   Can you describe what it was like this time?   I know where you were two years ago.   Your mom was here, Molly was here to celebrate with you, but Angie and Caleb were back home.   And today they're on the back of the green, seeing it in person.   
BUBBA WATSON:   This one is a lot different.   The first one for me it's almost like I lucked into it.   
This one was a lot of hard work, dedication, and got back here.   After giving away that jacket last year, kind of wanted it back.   So I told Adam that we should just keep switching back and forth.  
JIM NANTZ:   This is a routine here.   Jack and Arnie used to do this kind of thing.   Well, the great champion here from a year ago, Adam Scott is going to present the Green Jacket.   Billy, it's that time.  
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Thank you.   Adam, if you would please do the honor.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Bubba, congratulations.   We'll deserved, mate.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Thank you so much.   
CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE:   Congratulations, Bubba.   We're very proud of you.  
BUBBA WATSON:   Thank you very much.   I never loved green so much.
