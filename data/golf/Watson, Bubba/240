Q.   Bubba, nice way to finish.   Little exclamation point on 9.   Perfect way to play golf and perfect way to end it?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, it was nice.   We had no wind this morning when we first teed off.   I hit the ball great.   I missed one green today, missed it by six inches and I two‑putted everything.   It was a great day. 
I'll take 4‑under any day of the week.   So it's a good way to start. 

Q.   You're one step ahead of me there.   17 of 18 greens, you know you have to hit greens here.   So what is the secret tomorrow to get the putter going? 
BUBBA WATSON:   It's golf.   Tomorrow maybe they'll work a little bit better.   Maybe the way the sun shines differently, I'll read them better or stroke them better, whatever.   Just come out here and do the same thing.   If I can shoot 4‑under over the next three days, I'll be pretty happy.   I'm happy with it, but I want to make a few more putts.

Q.   Par‑5s are gettable.   How do you pick your spots outside of the par‑5s on this golf course? 
BUBBA WATSON:   There are a lot of holes where I can hit driver and bomb it down there.   But the problem is with as small as these greens are, you have to play smart, so I hit a couple irons off the tee today.   I hit my driver pretty well for the most part. 
So I've got to pick my spots, like you're saying.   I want to do it where it's smart, where I know I can attack a pin from the fairway or the rough.   So that's what I have to do.   Just look at the pin sheet and see where the pin is and how tough it really is.
