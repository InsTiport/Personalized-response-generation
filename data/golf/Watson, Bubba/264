Q.   We got it in.   Man, you look really, really spent.   How you feeling?
BUBBA WATSON:   Not good, man.   I just can't get enough fluids and food in me.   I've got no energy, really dehydrated.   Talk to the dock here in just a second and see if we have to get an IV or something.

Q.   With that being said, Top‑10 finish, you have to be pretty happy about that. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   That's what I wanted to do.   I wanted to come out here and play.   Felt terrible this morning‑‑ well, I still feel terrible. 
I wanted to get it in, because of Presidents Cup points, FedExCup points.   So I wanted to get it in so I could get off to a good start this year.

Q.   Looks like the ball‑striking was pretty darned good, you led yesterday in greens in regulation and more than anything, you had a lot of opportunities but just couldn't make any putts. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.   I didn't make any putts.   It gets gusty and windy and these greens are so slow and grainy and just tough, but somebody always plays good.   It's one of those things that you have to get better somehow and practice your putting I guess.
