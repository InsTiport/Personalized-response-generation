BUBBA WATSON: I thought it was good.  You miss some shots, you miss some putts, you make some putts.  You make some good shots.  My best finish in this tournament is 23rd, I think, they've been telling me all week.  I think I'm at 28th right now.  So it's about even par for me.   
I'm happy with it.  Form is getting better.  Putting with the new putter is great.  So everything is good.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure.  I used it last week at John Deere.  I got a little bit there.  But I needed more loft, so we put more loft on it.  But, yeah, just anything, a new club you've got to get a new club and see it, because it's different.  It's a Ping PLD, no name yet, PLD, Ping.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BUBBA WATSON: I don't know what they're going to name it.  They haven't named it yet.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BUBBA WATSON: I need to improve, but it's getting better.  It's slowly getting better.  Putting is getting good.  And I'm playing next week.  Hopefully I'm playing Akron and PGA.  Six in a row.  I've got three more, trying to move up the FedExCup, somehow win tournaments, so I can jump on that Presidents Cup team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BUBBA WATSON: The emotion is good.  You want to make the team.  You want to spend time with your friends.  You want to have a chance.  You want to have a chance to lift the trophy.  Anytime you can make that team, a team, you feel great, and you know you've been playing well.  And that's the key, trying to make some points, so you can make it and have fun and enjoy a week of celebration, and trying to win for your team and your country.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BUBBA WATSON: Well, it's totally different.  You can't compare the two.  It's like comparing a golfer from early era to a golfer now.  You can't do it.  Same as Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  You can't compare them.  You know the excitement, the adrenaline, all that feels about the same.  And just more people to celebrate with when you have a team.
