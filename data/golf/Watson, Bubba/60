 Q.  Looks like you're having fun out here.  It's fun, isn't it?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yes, it's very fun.  Anytime you're winning you feel good.  Today is one of those days with the gusty winds, on the back nine, here, especially it gets gusty down by this river.  It's going left-to-right and right-to-left.  It's always a guessing game.  That's why these holes are so difficult.  When I kicked it in the water trying to play safe, still went in the water and still won the hole.  It shows you how difficult it is.  He never got a penalty shot and it's that tough out here right now.  Par and a birdie here and there is a good score.   
 Q.  You're talking about the breeze affecting the approach shots.  What about putts on the green?  Did the wind affect that putt on 15?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, I'm going to blame that on the wind, for sure.  The first one I thought it was going to be faster.  The second one the wind gusted so right at impact I tried to shove it a little bit and tried to hold it against the wind and it missed.  I had the ability to waste the hole, I guess, because I got lucky the holes before.   
 Q.  You got to see the 16th today.  I wonder if you play 17 or 18 to see the holes or are you calling it a day?  
BUBBA WATSON: I'm calling it a day.  I want to never see those holes -- well, you know because of victories, not because of a loss.
