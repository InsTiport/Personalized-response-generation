 Q. Just talk about your 68. 
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, I didn't really think about it. At the end of the round, it was a 68, but I stayed focused on every hole and came out. You know, you're going to make some bogeys somewhere, I made a couple of bad swings that cost me a bogey here and there but other than that, it was a great day and any day you can keep it together in a major is a great day. 
 I just teed off, so the last time -- I had to wait six minutes to tee off. We got to No. 3 and we couldn't see, either. It was funny because I tried to hit a little 5-iron in there and as soon as I hit it, I saw it and it disappeared. Conditions were tough. Obviously now perfect weather, a little windy, a little tougher right now but this morning with that fog, you just have to trust your number and hope you get the club right. 

 Q. How did the conditions affect you? 
 BUBBA WATSON: Cold weather bothers me. You know, it's funny, I'm probably the first person to ever say this -- but drinking water and trying to stay hydrated the last five holes, I just wanted to finish so I could go to the bathroom quick. (Laughter) There's bathrooms for spectators than pros. 

 Q. Maybe that's why you shot 68 --
 BUBBA WATSON: Got to get through. 

 Q. You had a situation with your caddie? 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, my normal caddie for almost five years now, his baby was born a week early, and so this week Mark Carens is filling in for me, good friend of mine.
