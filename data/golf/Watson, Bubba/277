  BUBBA WATSON:   Tomorrow anything can happen, we've seen the Americans come back and the Europeans come back.   12 points on the board for tomorrow so no matter what the lead is or if we're tied, there's a lot of golf to be played.   
   
 Q.   You've been in the pressure of winning a Major Championship; are you expecting the same kind of pressure or even more pressure tomorrow?   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I think The Ryder Cup is more pressure than I've faced, I heard it before I got here and it's true.   You're playing for your country and your teammates in front of the world.   I think we want to win this more than a major.   
   
 Q.   How much do you guys want to finish this early?   
BUBBA WATSON:   You know, we want to win and tomorrow there's 12 points on the board so we have to go out there and get them.   The team is not going to lay down.   Europe is not going to lay down.   They are not going to give it to us.   We have to play good golf and come out focused and ready to win some points.   
WEBB SIMPSON:   I wish I could play with him in every major championship because he keeps me calm and laughing and that's what I need out here.   I tend to take it too serious, so having him makes me laugh and play better.
