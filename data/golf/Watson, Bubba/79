Q. Winning is always a confidence booster, but the way you did it never trailing in the match, does that bring you more confidence for the rest of the week?
BUBBA WATSON: That I can't explain.  Obviously it gives you confidence.  You know the ball striking is there.  There was a couple squirrelly shots.  I didn't have enough close birdie opportunities.  I let one slide on the par-5, give or take No. 12, I think it was.  But all in all, it was a good day.
You know, it's try not to make too many mistakes.  You eliminate the mistakes, let the other guy make the mistakes or whatever, try to hang on.  That's what I did today.
Q. Yesterday I was watching you work on the putting green.  When you were done with the session, you looked up and your caddie and your coach said, Better, isn't it?  It was better, wasn't it?
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure.  Snedeker helped me with some tips.  It was one of those things that I just got lost.  The ball position got in a bad spot.  Same with my driver, my irons and my chipping.  So over the last six months it was creeping the wrong way.  So we try to creep it back.  This was just a momentum going forward because we're looking at a long season, a long year.  So this is just a test.  We got through it today and hopefully I can keep going and maybe be here all week.  We're going forward and we're moving in the right direction, so it's good.
