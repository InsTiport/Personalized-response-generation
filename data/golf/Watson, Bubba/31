 Q.  You did try to put a crack in the armor today, but what was happening in your match?  
BUBBA WATSON: He just beat me.  He made birdie putts.  I missed birdie putts.  He played fantastic golf.  He never made a mistake, and when a guy never makes mistakes, I can't do anything and I just couldn't do anything and he didn't make a mistake.
