  Q. What was the key to today's round?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Yesterday I was just frustrated, nothing was going right, my ball-striking was off, didn't make any key putts, didn't make any momentum putts yesterday until the last hole I made a good putt to finish.   
 But today was just the ball-striking was there, the driver was back, irons were good, irons were crisp and then made some key putts today.  
  
  Q. When you say that ball-striking is back, you don't work with a guy, you're probably the most feel guy on TOUR. What do you change? What do you on the range -- or if it's more mental, what are you doing to alter your golf swing?  
 BUBBA WATSON: The golf swing stays the same, hopefully. It might not look like it, but hopefully it stays the same. It's just ball position. My driver, I've been missing everything to the right, and obviously the ball was up a little bit. And so I'm pretty slow, so I took about a month to figure that out.   
 And then today it just went better. I was cutting the ball back to the fairway like I was supposed to, and then when the ball position changed, my driver changed and my irons, and it helped my irons a little bit, and making a putt or two helped out a lot, too, if that makes sense.  
  
  Q. Did you get any UGA shouts out there? Was there any of that at all?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Maybe one -- no. I got tons. A lot of people saying "Go Dawgs" and barking at me, I guess. I guess that's good if they bark at me. I'm not a football player, I'm not used to that. No, it was good. There's a lot of support here, a lot of people yelling "Go Dawgs." So no, it's really good to play, especially play good in front of them.  
  
  Q. Been a while for you at this track, you haven't had a lot of red numbers here for whatever reason.   
 BUBBA WATSON: The PC answer is this course doesn't like me. This course doesn't like me. No, I just don't play good here, and the reason why is I just -- for my eyes, it doesn't look good. I can't see the -- what I mean by doesn't look good, it doesn't look good for my vision. The rough and the fairways look the same, a lot of blind shots hitting the fairways you can't see, and I'm very visual. I'm very weak minded, so I have to be able to visualize it. And if I can't, it's tough. That's what I mean by doesn't look good to me.  
 It's hard for me to judge. I just start goofing off when I can't tell where the fairway is or where the rough is.  
  
  Q. At what point in the round today did it occur to you this could be a preview of the Presidents Cup singles?  
 BUBBA WATSON: No, I was in amazement that I was playing good on this golf course. I wasn't thinking about anything else.  
  
  Q. Were you listening to the barks?  
 BUBBA WATSON: I heard those, but I was like, tell that dog to be quiet, but it was just a person.  
  
  Q. Did you have a lot of Bermuda in the pan handle?  
 BUBBA WATSON: I moved out of there, if you noticed. It's just different for me. Where I grew up, we didn't have a good golf course, so it was spotty, so it was a lot easier in spotty grass than consistent grass.  
  
  Q. The putt on 3, did that get you going?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Actually 18 yesterday helped me a little bit, made a good putt on the last hole for birdie. Finished probably my second best round here, I guess. I was pretty pumped about getting here and practicing a little bit, and for some reason we thought about last night what we could do to improve: ball position, and I changed putts a little bit. And then it just all started working. Yeah, that obviously helps.   
 The birdie from No. 2 green helped a lot more on the first hole than the one on 3. Gary Woodland was putting out while I'm over there driving onto his green.  
  
  Q. Do you know your scenario or is that just too confusing?  
 BUBBA WATSON: For what?   
  
  Q. For ten mill.   
 BUBBA WATSON: Oh, I'm not worried about ten mill. I'm worried about trying to win this golf tournament. I've got to win. It's simple. If you're No. 1, you've got to win because you've got to prepare that they're going to play good. If you're No. 1 or you're No. 30, if you don't win, it doesn't matter -- if everybody else falls into place, you have to do your job. I'm smart enough to realize that, I guess.  
  
  Q. You could be Player of the Year with three wins, right?  
 BUBBA WATSON: That's another sad -- if I'm Player of the Year, that's pretty sad, with all the negative talk about my golf swing.  
  
  Q. Nobody has got three wins, though.   
 BUBBA WATSON: But I don't have a major. That's all y'all write about is majors. I don't have one of those.  
  
  Q. Basically one guy with a major, and that's Luke, who's here.   
 BUBBA WATSON: Keegan, who's winning right now. But I don't think about that. I think about how tough the next 36 holes are going to be for me, especially if y'all keep talking to me, keep reminding me how bad I play this golf course.
