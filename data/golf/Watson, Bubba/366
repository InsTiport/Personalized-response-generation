 Q. How many people do you think bet on you two to beat Harrington and Donald, and Donald has never been beaten in Ryder Cup Team play. 
 JEFF OVERTON: A lot of my buddies did, I'm sure. I just want to thank all of the fellow Hoosiers who flew over from the U.S. to support us this week. 

 Q. Did you express a wish to play with each other? 
 BUBBA WATSON: No, I don't even like him. Look at him, he's ugly (laughing). 
 You know, all of us guys are good. We have got 12 guys on the team, 11 other ones besides me, so I would play with anybody. And his putter was hot this morning, and I love him as a partner.

 Q. You two are a couple of fourball guys, but are you going to be a couple of foursome guys? 
 JEFF OVERTON: I don't know. We'll have to see what Corey thinks and check out what the pairings should be here this afternoon. Should be fun. 

 Q. Are you feeling relieved that it's over, match one? 
 BUBBA WATSON: No, we enjoy playing golf, and especially the two guys we played, they are great competitors and great champions, you know, all across this world, and so it was fun. We always want to keep playing golf because we are golfers, but yeah, I nice to have one point under our belt.

 Q. And how about the spirit on the American side? 
 JEFF OVERTON: There's a ton of it. We have got a lot, but you've got to take your hats off to good old PÃ¡draig and Luke. They are excellent competitors and we really had a fun game out there.
