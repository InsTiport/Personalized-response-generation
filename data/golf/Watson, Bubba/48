 Q. Obviously you're feeling more comfortable than when you started the week.   
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure. That's what I said. I said on 13, the first day, something clicked, and you felt it, and so that's all we need, we just need a little something to spur us on. We're playing a great golf tournament and then Patrick Reed's doing really good. No, I mean, it was a day that we thought was going to be miserable, and a lot of guys got in without even getting any drops of rain, so it's ‑‑ somehow again the Augusta gods have let us finish the day or so far finish the day.  
   
 Q. Is that disheartening though when you play as well as you did and you look up and see what Patrick is doing?  
BUBBA WATSON: No, because, you know, I mean, we're so good out here, there's going to be times‑‑ we have seen Tiger through out the years, we have seen Jordan Spieth‑‑ I wasn't around when some of the other greats did this‑‑ but it's one of those things, we're good enough where, if we got the confidence, like I said, I got confidence on the 13th hole in the first round and ever since then I played a lot better. So we know that it's out there for somebody, hopefully we can still have a chance.   
   
 Q. Is this one of those days where when you had as many birdies as you did it could have been even better?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, I got a little lazy on 8 through 11 I started second guessing the wind and shot process for those few holes, I just kind of was, kind of went blank for a little bit.  
   
 Q. Second day in a row you saved on 18 there.   
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, that was nice. It was a difficult putt. I pulled the shot from the fairway, but it was a difficult putt. You think it has to break to the right but we know it broke to the left and it barely breaks to the left and somehow we made it.
