Q.   I know coming in you said you felt more comfortable as defending champion than you were two years ago.   Overall, what are your thoughts and is it tough to play pretty well, but just to see kind of a big gap on the scoreboard?
BUBBA WATSON:   You know, the last two days have been great, ball striking wise, but I just haven't made the putts. 
I got three, 3‑putts, which would put me at 5‑under, which is not too far off the other guys. 
And then Jordan's just, he's just playing great right now. 
But it's two more days, so if I just have those 3‑putts back, I would be right in the thick of this thing, but if I come out to a hot start tomorrow, great weekend, you never know what could happen.   But obviously, no, I'm not as scared or nervous as I was a couple years ago.   The golf course is still very difficult and I just haven't executed the way I needed to on the greens.
