 Q.   Talk about holing out ‑‑  
BUBBA WATSON:   It was funny, in the fairway, because the rain was coming, the wind; and so in the fairway, I was like, is that bunker okay, and he said yes.   That was what we were looking at, getting a four and I tried to cut one in there and it stayed in there and went in the bunker.   Nice lie, everything was great about it except it was raining into the wind and water, looking on the other side.   To make it to hole it out, just trying to hit one close to make an easy par but for it to actually fall in, obviously dinner is going to taste really good tonight.  
   
 Q.   How pleased are you with your round today, especially in the conditions?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Very pleased.   Coming down the stretch with the rain picking up makes those holes difficult, and choosing the right clubs in tough conditions.   
So for me, any time I can shoot under par on a tough golf course like this, it's going to keep your head in the game but also show that you're playing pretty well.   
   
 Q.   You're chasing, maybe five or six shots starting out, what's your mind‑set going to be to put pressure on J.B.?   
BUBBA WATSON:   It's the same thing.   I can't worry about what J.B. is doing.   This golf course is hard enough as it is.   If I start worrying about other people, I'm going to lose it.   For me, it's all about just picking the right clubs, hopefully getting the right numbers and making the right reads and making putts.   So at the end of the day, we'll add them up and hopefully I can scare him or have a chance for that win.  
   
 Q.   The fourth hole‑‑  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, we heard the hole‑in‑one, I think we were getting to the green on No. 3.   We saw Dustin cheering and celebrating, and then when we were on the fairway on 5, we saw J.B. made it.   Somehow we got‑‑ they forgot about us.   Maybe one of us should have made a hole‑in‑one instead of skip a group.
