 Q.  Talk about your position and place.  BUBBA WATSON: It was a good day.  The front nine is always tough for me because of trying to get the ball in the fairways.  No. 6, downwind with that pin behind the bunker -- I think it's 6 -- 6, downwind, over that bunker, it's hard to get it close. So there's some holes out there that were tough.  A dumb 3-putt on 9 cost me a little bit, but making birdies on the three par 5s, it's not easy to do it, but to do it obviously helps out the day.  And to get up-and-down on 17 was big. So I'm right where I want to be.  I just wish the leader was a little closer to us.   Q.  The fact that there's a Canadian at the top of the leaderboard, what does it say for all the players out there?  BUBBA WATSON: Truthfully, let's be honest, we don't think about where somebody's from.  All we think about is there's a guy in front of us. I've got a couple of family members, they're going to pull for me, too.  But they're going to pull for a guy that's playing good.  They want to see good golf shots.  Obviously, he's from Canada, so they'll be pulling for him a bit more.  I married a Canadian, so hopefully they'll pull for me as well.   Q.  People love you here, and they also love David Hearn.  Tomorrow this final paring could be incredibly exciting.  Are you looking forward to that?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah.  Anytime we have a chance to win a golf tournament.  Obviously he'll be the crowd favorite.  The sponsor would love to have a Canadian win.  For me, I'm half Canadian, I guess you could say, so hopefully they'll pull for me, too.   Q.  Looks like you have been hitting on the moon, long drives all day long.  What's the key out there?  BUBBA WATSON: Keep them inbounds.  That's the whole key for me.  As long as we're in bounds, we're all right.   Q.  The fact there is so much possibility for change down the last three holes, is that going to add some excitement?  BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, that's why I think one year they tried to make it a par 4.  I think that's why they left it, so there's some movement.  The crowds have the movement.  Crowds can watch some great golf, some crazy golf, and hopefully see some excitement.  Obviously the sponsor and the crowd here wants a Canadian to win.  So they're hoping that it goes that way.   Q.  Are you in the role of spoiler tomorrow?  BUBBA WATSON: No.  I'm just going to try to play good golf.  I could shoot -- let's be honest, if the wind dies down like they say it's going to, what I saw this morning, they said it's going to die down tomorrow, it's going to be a birdie fest. I'm just trying to keep pace.  We all have pressure on us.  We all want to win golf tournaments.  We all want to finish high if we don't win.  We'll just be out there grinding away worrying about ourselves.
