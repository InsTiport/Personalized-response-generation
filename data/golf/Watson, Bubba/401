 Q. How are you feeling so far after two days and a little bit of heat?
 BUBBA WATSON: The heat is pretty good today. I was drinking a lot of water but it's always good to get in two solid rounds, 10-under, four back. So I'm not out of it, but for the first time being here, I played well. Played good for two days. And two more days, I'll play real well. 

 Q. Did the heat in the afternoon, did it help your game, or does it take a lot out of you? 
 BUBBA WATSON: It takes a lot out of you but the ball goes a lot farther. So it makes it a little tougher. Sometimes the golf course changes from morning to afternoon, but for the most part, it's just hot. 
 No matter what you're doing at the time, it's going to be hot so you just have to drink a lot of water. Even when you don't want to drink water, you have to, so that's the only part you have to worry about.

 Q. Do you have a hole that you've played well both days? 
 BUBBA WATSON: 17, I've actually birdied it both days. Surprised it's been good to me. 

 Q. Does feeding off the crowd help your game? 
 BUBBA WATSON: It helps when you hit a ball good but when you hit it bad they boo. I hit it three feet yesterday and I hit it to 15 feet today and made it today and made it yesterday, so that made it a lot easier.

 Q. What will you work on tonight for the weekend? 
 BUBBA WATSON: I don't really work on stuff after my rounds. If you don't have it, you just don't have it this week. But so far, I've got it, so hopefully I can play two more solid rounds. If I can play like I did the first two days, I'll be good to go. 
 The last two weeks I putted really well and so far I'm putting great these two days so hopefully I can keep that going.

 Q. Is it something new you've been doing? 
 BUBBA WATSON: I don't want to give up my secret, but no, just more practice and more worried about the stroke than making it. When you start thinking about making it, you put so much pressure on yourself. For the most part thinking about making a good stroke. If you hit it and it goes in, you know you've made a good stroke.
