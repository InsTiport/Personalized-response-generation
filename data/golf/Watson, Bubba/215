 Q.   What did you hit on 15?  
BUBBA WATSON:   4‑wood off the tee and 4‑iron.  
   
 Q.   How far?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Roughly 245, downwind.  
   
 Q.   Putt?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Foot and a half.  
   
 Q.   You bogeyed the last two, but you're also right there at three off the lead.   What's kind of your mood going into the weekend?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Very good.   Very good.   There's a few holes at every golf course, but if you know my record around here, there's a few holes that I really played really bad around here.   
So 18 doesn't set up good for me at all.   I hate the look of it.   16 today, I hit a good shot on 16.   But 17 I've never played well either in the tournament.   So that last stretch is really tough for me.   
But, no, I can't look at the bogeys.   I've got to look at where I'm at.   If you told me it's my best two days around this golf course, I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   You did pretty well back wherever you were?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Exactly.   I think my best finish here is 18th or 19th.   Right now I'm hanging above it.  
   
 Q.   16 you don't like, I know.   How did you figure that out?  
BUBBA WATSON:   I just hit a good shot today.   There's two shots‑‑  
   
 Q.   It's a tough (indiscernible).   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah.   So today I figured it out.   
   
 Q.   What annoys you on 18?  
BUBBA WATSON:   After I putted?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.  
BUBBA WATSON:   There's a camera guy that took two pictures of them shaking hands when I was tapping in.   You could hear it.   It was pretty obvious.   
   
 Q.   Is this a day where you embrace the grind?   Kind of have to do that in golf, but today‑‑  
BUBBA WATSON:   Today I hit two shots‑‑ only hit two shots that I wish I could re‑do that I didn't stay focused over, wasn't committed to.   That was the shot on 14 tee and that was the shot on 18 right there.   
The bogeys I made on the front nine, I hit a 9‑iron from 183 that flew over the green to a bad lie, tough lie.   
Hit wedge from 152 that flew over the green on 13 to a bad lie.   And I just missed a putt.   Hit a great putt and missed it.   Every time I missed the green, I had a tough lie.   
Hit a 7‑iron that went farther than I expected on 17.   Tried to be short of the hole but flew past the hole.   
And then I just hit a bad swing on 18 there.  
   
 Q.   How far was the 7‑iron there‑‑  
BUBBA WATSON:   We had 191, I think‑‑ 196 hole.   And we thought it was a little bit into the breeze and just flew past somehow.  
   
 Q.   What was going on on 14?   Did you play it off the path?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, I played it off the path.  
   
 Q.   Was it just an angle thing?  
BUBBA WATSON:   No, on the one side where I'd have to drop it, it was a steep slope.   I had to chip out.  
   
 Q.   You had to be pretty happy with that, considering the outcome.   
BUBBA WATSON:   It's off the cart path.   It's kind of like off a mat.   Everybody can hit a good shot off that.   You always make solid contact.   
I knew it was going to jump.   But with the water in front, I just had to play it that way.   So it went over the green.   And, again, tough lie.   Tough up‑and‑down.   
So every time I missed the green, it wasn't because of left to right, it was because of just not the right distance.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) faster and firmer, does that help you or hurt you?  
BUBBA WATSON:   I'll tell you in a couple days.   But we all want it tough.   Where I'm at right now, if it's tough for everybody, then it's going to be tough for them to catch me.   And then so I can at least try to get a second place out here.  
But it's going to be tough for everybody.   I mean, the golf course always every year‑‑ I mean, there's a guy right now in double digits under par, but for the most part you rarely get to see that around here because the conditions make it so tough.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any history with Paul from the time you spent in Scottsdale?  
BUBBA WATSON:   No.   Just out here on the TOUR.  
   
 Q.   Were you happy with the way you stayed patient?   Do you think you stayed patient today?   Assess that for me.   
BUBBA WATSON:   I think I did.   Like I said, like I answered a second ago, I had two swings I wish I could redo just because of a commitment, not trusting it.   
The bogeys that I made, I saw a 9‑iron that went 190 yards on 8, and I saw a wedge that went about 165 yards on 13.   
And so I don't really see‑‑ and then the two committed swings on 18 and 14 were two other bogeys.   
So I don't really see it as a bad day.   And any day you can shoot in the 60s at Muirfield you're pretty happy with, I think.   
I don't know if you've ever shot in the 60s here, but you'd be happy about it.   
(Laughter).  
   
 Q.   And that's got to be‑‑ it's one thing for you to send something long out of the fairway or semi or something like that, but off the tee, that's kind of unusual?  
BUBBA WATSON:   It's downwind.   Again, you're always guessing the wind.   You have these white things flying around in the air, but you don't know if they're flying in the right direction.   So the 9‑iron just jumped and flew.  
   
 Q.   No allergies?  
BUBBA WATSON:   No, they're pretty bad.   Sneezed a lot today.  
   
 Q.   Watching the boards much?   Do you watch the boards out here?  
BUBBA WATSON:   No, it's Friday.   Sunday I will.   I'll see if I get that top 18.
