 Q.  Bubba, if we can just get some thoughts on your week as a whole as the defending champion here.  
BUBBA WATSON: It's always an honor and a privilege to come back as defending champion.  That's means you're healthy because the tournament usually let's you back.   
To be here and to challenge again, you know, it's been a while since we seen conditions like this.  For me, my technique of chipping and stuff, it was difficult.  I hit a lot fat shots.  It's something to learn from and move on from from the golf side of it, but couldn't ask for better Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  Seeing the kids and just interacting with them and talking to different people here at Travelers, it's been an honor and a privilege to represent the tournament for the past year.   
 Q.  How about the fans that follow you.  On the 18th hole you're giving kids gloves and balls.  Do you realize how special that is?  
BUBBA WATSON: Well, I don't, no.  I never got that as a kid.  I never went to golf tournaments, sporting events, but I know what -- I see the smiles an their faces.  We're talking about growing the game of golf.  Not just one sport, right?  Now with the Olympic and everything those kinds might be champions here, they might be Olympians one day because of the game of golf.  Anything I can do to put a smile on think face is worth it.   
I know sometimes it looks like I'm angry out there, but most of the time I'm pretty happy and I understand what it mean.  So when I putt out, it's done.  It doesn't matter how good or bad I played.  It's about growing the game and representing the game in the right way.
