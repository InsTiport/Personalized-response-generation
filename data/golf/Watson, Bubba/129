Q. How good was a 2-under today?
BUBBA WATSON: It was really good.  I was 2-over early.  Teddy always says, just hang on.  Even though this course doesn't suit me very well, he said just hang on, it's a tough day, we know we can make some birdies on the back nine.
The front nine always gets me the first like six holes.  So just got to hang on.
I made a couple putts, got a great birdie on 6, I think it is.
And another one out of the bunker on 7.
And a good birdie 9.
So I just kept fighting.  And I made the par putts, got up-and-down from some good spots and so it was a great day.
I'm back in the top-10, so depending upon what the weather is tomorrow, a low round could still secure the championship.
Q. Are you thinking going into tomorrow if the leaders can drop back a little more today?
BUBBA WATSON: I don't know about dropping back anymore.  Let's just say, I think the lead is 7 right now, so as we're talking, the lead is 7, that's six shots.
If I shoot 8-under or 9-under the -- Henrik shot a low score the first day.  So just depending upon pressure and everything, if I went out and shot an 8-under, 9-under, that puts some pressure on the other guys when they see a good a guy that's finished or playing well like that.
Q. As far as conditions, where does this rank up there?
BUBBA WATSON: I normally don't play that well in bad weather, so this ranks pretty good for me.  It was tough out there.
The ball is not going as far, a little bit cooler.  Seems like every hole is into the wind or into the mist.  So this golf course was playing really, really long today.  So it made it very difficult out there.
