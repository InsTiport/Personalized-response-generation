 Q. How tough was it out there?
 BUBBA WATSON: It was very tough. The golf course is a very difficult golf course. The fairways are hard to hit with all the bunkers and the water. It's a tough golf course.

 Q. How about the finishing stretch there, 15 through 18?
 BUBBA WATSON: Well, I played those good today, so those were great. It was the other holes that messed me up.

 Q. What do you take into tomorrow?
 BUBBA WATSON: Tomorrow, knowing that I can do it. I mean, I was 3-under, 4-under at one time, so I know I can do it. But you know, it's a learning process. Pretty much your whole life is learning. 
 I'm going to take a lot from today, but hopefully going forward -- it might not work tomorrow, it might not work this week, it might not work the rest of this year, but next year hopefully it'll work.

 Q. When you have it going well and then it turns on you like that, I guess you feel that happening or is it a mechanical thing at that point or what happens?
 BUBBA WATSON: No, things happen. I had a situation that happened on No. 1, my 10th hole, where I was in the bunker and the guy started banging in the stake after they took out the stake for Overton, and it happened right when I swung and I lost focus and lost focus for the rest of the day, and I was mad. I wasn't mad at the volunteer, I was mad at myself because I just lost focus.

 Q. What's your message on Twitter today?
 BUBBA WATSON: I suck at golf.
