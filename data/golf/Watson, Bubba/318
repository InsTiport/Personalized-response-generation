  Q. You battled again today.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: It was tougher. We got off to a pretty good start but the pins are real hard today and tough to get close to. I struggled a little bit but had a good partner and he kind of helped me in there. Finished off strong.   
  
  Q. Bubba, you want to stay with this guy, stick with him the next couple of days?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Yes I do. He's doing good right now. I'm riding his coat tails really good and somehow we got two points.   
  
  Q. First point of the United States, what was going through your mind?   
 BUBBA WATSON: A key on a golf course like today is pars. You have to make pars. The pins were in tough spots. Just make pars. You're going to throw in a birdie here and there but just try to make pars and that's what we tried to do.   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Yeah, I just think a few holes there -- yesterday, we didn't make a bogey and the wind was down yesterday and it was obviously a lot easier. Today was tough. We gave them a few and they gave us a few. Like Bubba said, it was a matter of making pars and staying consistent.   
  
  Q. Seeing this golf course for the first time this time this week, how have you been able to adapt so quickly? What's been the key?   
 WEBB SIMPSON: Well, if you're trying to figure out a golf course and know every little angle and bounce, sometimes you start thinking too much. So coming out here, both of us have great caddies, and we are just kind of trying to keep the ball in front of us and in the fairway and hit it on the green.
