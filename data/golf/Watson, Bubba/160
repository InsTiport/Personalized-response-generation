Q.   I think I heard you say before, anything under par out here you feel pretty good about.   I think you gave one back there on 18, but?
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, last two holes‑‑ I chipped in on 17 for par, but the last two holes you could just tell ‑‑ I got a little tired.   5:15 to play golf.   Both my tee shots were way to the left.   Just shoved them.   I was just tired.   I was not committed, not focused. 
Other than that, it was a good day.   It's a Major Championship.   I missed a few putts here and there.   3‑putted twice.   So if you take the two, 3‑putts away, two shots better, be in the 60s, so not too bad.   I didn't play my way out of it and I'm not too far behind, so I'm happy with it. 

Q.   Was that longer than usual?
BUBBA WATSON:   No, it's always about five hours, give or take.   Tomorrow's afternoon rounds or today's afternoon rounds are going to be a lot longer.

Q.   What about the speed of the course compared to earlier in the week?   About the same?
BUBBA WATSON:   It's a little slower.   Had some mud on the ball, a little bit.   So, obviously it's soft just because of the rain.   That's just how nature is. 
But it's fast.   I mean, it's still good.   The course is still moving.   The greens are running nicely.   They're still firm.   You still have to be careful out there.

Q.   4, 5, and 6 I think you had a birdie and a bogey there.   Talk about how important those stretch of holes can be in getting around kick started. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, it's a tough stretch.   The start here is pretty tough.   No. 2 and number 3 are‑‑ you can see today there were some birdies out there. 
1, that's a tough start, just because everybody's jittery on the first tee. 
Then 4 is a real golf hole.   200 some odd yards there. 
5 is tough because of the green complex.   But today I birdied 5. 
The pin was in the far right on 6 and I was about 60 feet, 50 feet whatever it was, up a big slope and I 3‑putted there. 
So, yeah, I played them even par, so that's what you have to tell yourself when you do something like that is that you played them even par.   So you can't get down on yourself. 
But, yeah, there's chances to birdie a few of them.   Justin played pretty good, he birdied a few of them.   I think he actually birdied 6 as well.

Q.   When you see 5‑under as leading score right now, given the conditions and the way the course is playing, it doesn't surprise you?
BUBBA WATSON:   No.   Because if you look at it, I mean even my round, I could easily have hit a better tee shot on 18 and made par.   And then my two 3‑putts. 
I missed three greens.   I missed the first hole and 17 and 18.   So, other than that, I just didn't make any putts.   So I'm right there. 
No, you can see 5‑under.   Justin could have made a couple more.   He just left it a half roll short on 18 there.   So, yeah, you can see it today. 
Now if the wind in the afternoon‑‑ all this stuff has picked up a little bit.   People start seeing the lead, so they kind of ‑‑ it's harder to make birdies, the greens are a little bit firmer with the heat and the sun.   So, it's tougher in the afternoon. 
But in the morning, yeah, you could easily see that, somebody gets hot around here.   Now for four days doing that?   It's a Major Championship, it's always hard doing that.

Q.   Second time defending, any difference in the way you prepared for this year and how you approach your round today coming into this one?
BUBBA WATSON:   No, everything was the same.   I didn't change anything.   I told my caddie after a couple holes, I said I was a little amped up, so I just needed to calm down.   So I started walking slower. 
Then that's what happened in '13.   '13, I just didn't know how to calm down and settle down.   I still made the cut, but I didn't finish as high as I wanted to.

Q.   How much more relaxed having had the success?
BUBBA WATSON:   Having two jackets, you're pretty excited when you get here.   So, obviously, the more you learn, the more you play the golf course, the more you learn.   And having the success, winning twice, knowing I have the ability to do it, obviously that calms you down and let's you try to play golf a little bit.
