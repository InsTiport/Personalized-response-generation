 Q. A few quick comments on the round today. You're obviously in great position as you head into tomorrow?
 BUBBA WATSON: The weather is supposed to be coming up tomorrow so hopefully I'm in a great position. 1-under tomorrow might be great. It was rough, the first tee shot I hooked; hit a tree on the second shot. Shanked one on 8, made bogey. 
 And then I hit a toe-hook going for the green on 14 and luckily made par there. 
 But all in all it was a great day. 1-under always is good out here on this course.
