 Q. Talk about your position for the weekend. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, the golf course is hard. I just didn't make the putts today. The green speeds were a little slower, and I couldn't get used to it. After yesterday being lightning fast, today a little bit slower, probably about a foot slower. I just couldn't get used to it. I just never made the putts that I made yesterday.

 Q. 22 putts in the opening round, 30 putts in the second round, but I thought the wind was also a factor, more breeze in the second round and a lot of crosswind, as well. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, there was. The tee shots were a little harder because some of the longer holes were into the wind, so it made it a lot longer course today. You know, for the most part, though, my ball-striking was fine. I probably hit better shots than I did yesterday ball-striking, it was just the putts. If I would have just made three putts, look where I'd be. 
 So I just didn't make the putts, and that's a good start going into the weekend. I'm right there in the thick of things, but at the same time, I know that I can putt and just hopefully tomorrow they'll fall.

 Q. After a win at the Travelers, how much more comfortable are you being in this position?
 BUBBA WATSON: I still get nervous because I want to play so good, so you still get nervous. But comfortable? I'm getting used to it. I understand there's going to be bigger crowds, more cameras, so I'm used to the movement and stuff, it just takes time. If you do it a lot, it makes it a lot easier, but right now I'm just getting used to it and just starting to see my name up there a lot.

 Q. You're averaging 316 off the tee. Are you comfortable hitting shots out of the rough if you're a little bit off? You'd rather hit a shot out of the rough from 100 yards to the green than hit 3-wood off the tee?
 BUBBA WATSON: Sure. I've never been a straight ball hitter. I'm used to the rough my whole career, my whole life I've been in the rough a lot, so I'm used to it.
