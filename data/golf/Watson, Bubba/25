 Q. How much fun was it, obviously you've been in the years for seven years now.   
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, no, it's always good. To this day I guess I can kind of speak for everybody else, it's almost like you can't imagine that you're there, right, us young guys. All the history, all the stuff that has happened, sitting across from Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson, when Arnold was here, and then when you think about Bob Goalby, his age, the history, the knowledge that he has, when he speaks, no matter who is in the room, they listen, right? And it's an honor and a privilege and it's one of those things that you just, you can believe it's actually true that I'm in there. When you're talking about the history of the game and the greats of the game.  
   
 Q. Did he, Mr.Goalby, did he comment on Doug Ford last night or did anyone say anything about Mr.Ford?  
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, we talked about everybody, every champion. It's one of those things where everyone just kind of shares stories and like I said when he stands up, he always stands up, he never sits down when he talks, and when he stands up, we all quiet down fast. Because it's just, it's, I don't know if it's being the senior there or what, it's just we always take it and know it's life experiences that we can only dream of, because he's been around the greats of the game in their primes. So for us young guys, like Spieth, Willett, Sergio, we never got to experience the greats of the game back then.   
   
 Q. Who tells the best jokes?  
BUBBA WATSON: Best jokes? Gosh, last night ‑‑ I can't tell you the joke ‑‑ but I'll have to say it made us all giggle, is Mr.Goalby, he pulled one out of the hat, that was, it had us all giggling. We were talking about it on the practice tee too when we were warming up today.   
   
 Q. Talking about you and ‑‑ Goalby wasn't out there?  
BUBBA WATSON: No, it was just other guys that were there, other past champions. We were still giggling about it. Because it was just funny when you got a guy like that making jokes and it makes us laugh pretty good.
