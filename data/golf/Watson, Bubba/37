 Q.  Bubba, at 2-under yesterday you said you were miserable out there.  How about today with the 66?  
BUBBA WATSON: Oh, it's better, obviously.  My wife had a talking to me last night and said my attitude was terrible, so I had to change it.  Last few holes I got frustrated, just because I thought I hit good putts and didn't make anything.  My whole goal today was to get in around top 15 so I could have a chance on the weekend.   
We were close to that.  Had to get to 7-under, but all in all, it's a good two days.  You know, I still have a chance to fight and compete and try to win.   
 Q.  Yesterday you also mentioned the pressure you're putting on yourself because you're playing here in your backyard at The Greenbrier.  You've already had a successful season, so how do you manage the expectations you set for yourself?  
BUBBA WATSON: That's in the past.  I could care less about what happened earlier in the year.  We're trying to get the trophy this week, and whoever gets the trophy this week is trying to get the trophy next week.  So you're always looking forward.  You're always looking for the next event, and just like the media, they'll forget about you.   
It was two weeks ago I won, so I've got to keep challenging myself and try to get better.  You know, I've played here, this is my fifth year here, I think, in the event, and I haven't putted very good at all, so that's been the weird thing.  I've hit the ball very good, but just making the putts I need to make.  I haven't done it yet, maybe this weekend will be a surprise.
