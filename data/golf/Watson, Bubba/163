Q.   Your thoughts on the week? 
BUBBA WATSON:   This is my third Top‑5 in four years.   It's a good start.   It means I'm heading in the right direction.   L.A. I was a little off my game, and here, this golf course will make you look bad sometimes.   But overall for the whole week it was a great week. 

Q.   Golf is such a fickle game, you played flawless golf for the first ten holes and you just couldn't get it together, could you. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, if you look, I missed the fairway by on 12 by five feet.   Then I plugged it in the lip where if it doesn't plug, I might be able to save par there.   It's a couple feet here and there.   It wasn't anything major.   It wasn't like I was yelling "fore" left and right.   I'm happy with that.   Just one of those things, the tough part is just missing fairways and just missing greens.
I got to the back nine, a couple shots, just missed fairway by a few feet.   Missed the green by a few feet.   That's what this golf course does.   If you're just off, it can get to you real fast. 

Q.   Once you made those three bogeys, you're now behind and chasing.   Were you thinking of pressing and trying to make a birdie on a difficult hole or wait for him to make a mistake?
BUBBA WATSON:   I was trying to press.   I hit a good shot on the par3.   I hit a good shot on 17.   On 18, hit a great shot‑‑ just didn't make any putts.   It's a great week but obviously you wish it would have finished up a little different.
