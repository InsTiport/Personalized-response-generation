   BUBBA WATSON:  It felt good, coming down the stretch.   
  
  Q.  You had it to 11 earlier?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  Yeah, I made a bad swing and cost me a bogey.  14, I had a bad lie in the rough.  I thought it might jump out of there and it didn't, so came short of the bunker and short-sided myself.   
  
  Q.  This is your third, is that your best on the PGA TOUR?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  I've had a third and a fourth.  It's good.  We're going in the right direction.  We're getting where the pressure on Sunday, we're getting where we can play in that and stay focused.  That's my main goal is stay focused.  I have all the shots, once I get used to being in the limelight, fourth or fifth, maybe get a win sometime check.   
  
  Q.  Looking ahead to next week, how much are you looking forward to that?   
 BUBBA WATSON:  It's really fun.  I've heard a lot about it, and so people said it should be good for my game.  J.B. Holmes winning, he's a big hitter.  So I'm looking forward to it and I heard the greens are always nice out there.  It's nice to finish strong going in with a positive frame of mind.   
  
  Q.  When you know there's a course that rewards length --   
 BUBBA WATSON:  Just keep it in the wide fairways, you know.
