 Q. Obviously didn't come out the way you wanted. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, it's not very good, didn't play very good, didn't hit the ball very good, so equals out to 73, 3-over, whatever that is.

 Q. First competitive round on this course, what do you think of the track itself? 
 BUBBA WATSON: I love France. France is a nice place. Paris is a beautiful city. 

 Q. Have you got a chance to see some of the sights?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yes, I have. I went to the Eiffel Tower, to the Louvre, something like that, and the arch way (sic), and saw the castle that we are staying next to. 

 Q. Is this something you're going to do a bit more of, playing globally? You have a huge fan base here and all over Europe. 
 BUBBA WATSON: I think this might be the only one. 

 Q. Is that right?
 BUBBA WATSON: I miss my home.
