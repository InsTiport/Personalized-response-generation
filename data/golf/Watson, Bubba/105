  BUBBA WATSON: I didn't perform at a high level.  
   
 Q. Is it tough to be aggressive on some of the par‑5s?  
BUBBA WATSON: I hit it in the bunker, I hit a bad tee shot. Then you just have to play safe, I guess. I hit it in the bunker, so I couldn't go for it, so I had to just lay it up. And had to lay way back.  
   
 Q. The way you like to move the ball more than a lot of other guys, you might be more affected by the wind. Did you see that, did you feel it out there?  
BUBBA WATSON: No. Everybody is affected. I mean it's just one of those things. It's about trusting it and getting the right gust.   
The wind‑‑ on Sergio on the last hole, even on low winds like today, it was downwind for me. And the wind stopped for him and he went for the front bunker. Still made par. But it just changed that much, that quick.   
So when it's gusting even 30 miles an hour, it even changes real fast. So it's just one of those things. It wasn't my week. And hopefully next year it's my week.  
   
 Q. You've had two wins here, how do you recapture that magic each year at the Masters?  
BUBBA WATSON: I've just got to play good. I've still got a whole year until the next one. I've got a lot of tournaments between now and then. I've got a lot of practicing to do. And hopefully next year, again, like I said, hopefully it's my year next year.  
   
 Q. Will you go back now and watch the end of the tournament?   
BUBBA WATSON: Oh, yeah, I'll go watch. You want to watch and see what other guys are doing and you take notes for following years. Your caddie always writes down what the wind is doing today and you watch what people are hitting off tees. And you get ready for putting it in your memory bank for next year or years down the road.   
   
 Q. How much do you embrace the winds, whether it's here or other venues, is that something that suits your game or?  
BUBBA WATSON: You're outdoors, so you don't know if it's going to be high winds or no winds at all. Like a U.S. Open, totally different, because you worry about the rough, not about the weather. So it just depends on what venue you're at and where you're at.   
Obviously the British Open is different because there's not that many trees on the golf courses that we play. So there's going to be more‑‑ windier. Seems like every year we go there it's always windy around there.
