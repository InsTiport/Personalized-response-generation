 Q.  Bubba, top five this week.  Sum up your week and your standings in the FedExCup heading into the next three Playoff events.  
BUBBA WATSON: It's funny.  I'll answer the question before I answer the question.  Me and Teddy were out on the 15th hole.  I said, Teddy, I'm playing good the last few months, and Jason Day is playing a thousand times better.   
It seems like he's my thorn right now.  But you know what, it's a great week.  Obviously you want to stay up there in the top five going into Atlanta.  That's what you need to do.   
Obviously a third didn't move me any on the FedExCup, but it just gives me a little bit more lead on the next guy.  So it's good.  It's a good start.  Hopefully I can take over this good play to next week.
