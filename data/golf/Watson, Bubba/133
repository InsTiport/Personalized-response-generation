Q. Just comment on your day as a whole.
BUBBA WATSON: It was good.  At the end of the day, obviously I didn't shoot myself in the foot.  I still have a shot at it.  You know, I hit some bad shots, hit some good shots.  All in all, I'm happy where I'm at.  Have a chance on Sunday, and that's what we want starting the week.  That's what we want starting the week.
Q. You're projected third in the standings.  Does that into your mind-set at all?
BUBBA WATSON: No, nobody cares.  I mean, let's be honest.  It resets in Atlanta.  So you could win -- you could win tomorrow and then next two, and then finish second in Atlanta and lose.  It's all about who wins Atlanta really.
Q. How is the course playing different this year?
BUBBA WATSON: It's a lot firmer and it looks like we might have a chance to get four rounds in.  But yeah, it's still difficult.  The golf course was playing so soft last time.  Made it a little bit easier but it's very difficult this year.
Q. What do you think the winning score is tomorrow?
BUBBA WATSON: Whatever I shoot hopefully.  I don't know what the other guys -- whatever it takes to win, I hope it's mine.
Q. Different game plan tomorrow?
BUBBA WATSON: No, just hopefully make putts and not miss them and have the trophy.
Q. What's the one thing you take from today into tomorrow?
BUBBA WATSON: Nothing.  I mean, it's just -- it's golf.  I just come out and try to do the same thing tomorrow and hopefully tomorrow my score is good enough to take home the trophy.
