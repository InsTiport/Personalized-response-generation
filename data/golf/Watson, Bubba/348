  Q. Bubba, good round today, wanted to talk to you about that birdie at the 8th from on top of the hole racing down from the slope of that green.   
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, that putts's fast. Downgrain, downwind, downhill; it was everything possible. Somehow it hit the hole. It was going to roll probably eight feet past; just you can't stop it.   
  
  Q. When did you sense the conditions got more difficult as the day went on when the wind started to gust?  
 BUBBA WATSON: We knew we had it somewhat easy -- not easy but somewhat easy on the wind on the back nine, and then we made the turn to the front nine and it gets tough on that front nine with all of that water lurking with the wind like that.   
  
  Q. Were these course conditions good preparation for the Masters?   
 BUBBA WATSON: I guess. Any play and practice is good for the Masters, so it's good for any tournament. It's so windy today, it's just a tough day of golf right now.
