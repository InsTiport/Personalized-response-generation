 Q. Obviously wasn't looking so good as you made the turn, but that's the beauty of match play, you never quit, and here we go?
 BUBBA WATSON: My caddie kept saying you're playing great, you're playing great all week. Just keep doing your thing. If he beats you, he beats you. If you make birdie and he beats you, what can you do? 
 So I was under par, I think I was even or 1-under at the time of the turn, he was beating me, he was playing great. And I started making birdies and he missed some shots, missed some putts, left a couple doors open. I made like four or three birdies in the row. I played hard on the back nine and came out with a victory.

 Q. I'm sure you've had a lot of match play experience in your career so far, have you ever come from behind like that?
 BUBBA WATSON: No, nothing like that. You're really close to being out of the game. I was 5 down with 8 to go. So you're not looking too good. And then I got lucky, he hit a 3-wood that went almost 400 yards into the desert. I won 11. 
 Then I birdied a couple of holes coming down and just caught him.
