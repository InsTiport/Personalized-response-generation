  Q. Quite the convincing victory today, just a few comments about the match?  
 BUBBA WATSON: You know, I played really good. I played really solid: no bogeys, no bad swings. You know, and I didn't make any mistakes. And he didn't really make the putts that he needed to make. He played solid, but didn't make enough birdies, obviously.  
 And again it's tough beating a friend. It's tough beating a friend, but I won. I'd take it, just like he'd take it if he beat me.  
  
  Q. You mentioned yesterday whether it's the friend or not --  
 BUBBA WATSON: The goal is to win.   
  
  Q. Any shots, anything that stands out in your mind that you're particularly proud of today?  
 BUBBA WATSON: Just -- all of them. And my mind is in the right place right now. I'm confident. I'm focused on what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm enjoying the game of golf right now. It's fun.
