 Q. Just WD a little disappointing. Talk about the reason why and how you're feeling. 
 BUBBA WATSON: I'm feeling a little sore. You know, the problem is my stomach, lower stomach. I have like a pulled muscle, strain, I don't know what you would call it. But I went to the ER earlier in the week just to check it out, making sure it wasn't something more serious. Then it was still bothering me so I did a CAT scan, so I did an ultrasound and a CAT scan, so I did two visits to the doctors two days apart. 
 Tried to go today. It's just my mind was worried about that and not worried about playing golf. I'm not in the right place. I'm worried about my -- I need to rest. I need to rest my stomach and hopefully get better for Tucson.

 Q. So you don't think this will affect next week?
 BUBBA WATSON: I hope not. We'll see. It affected today just because I wasn't thinking about golf.

 Q. Did they say when you'd have results back?
 BUBBA WATSON: Oh, no, everything is fine. We know it's some kind of pulled strain. We know it's nothing serious. Blood work and everything is great.
