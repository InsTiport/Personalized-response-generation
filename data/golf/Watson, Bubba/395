 Q. Nine birdies, no bogeys. Do you feel like you were a little bit better on the back nine than the front?
 BUBBA WATSON: No. I shot 5-under on the front and 4-under on the back. 

 Q. Feel good about the day?
 BUBBA WATSON: Any time you shoot 9-under, you feel good. I started the week at, what, second place? After I shot the 62 the first round, kind of struggled the second day, but came back a little bit. And so I dropped down to 13th, I think. And then I dropped down 20, 23rd last night, so now I'm back up to, I think, third right now. So still in the top-10, still in the Top-5, and I got an outside shot at winning. So any time you have a chance to win, it's great. It's a good feeling, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

 Q. How does this setup for you tomorrow? You did so well on the Palmer Course, 10-under there. 
 BUBBA WATSON: I think everybody did well on Palmer, so...

 Q. And this is the toughest course usually. 
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. It should set up good. If there's no wind again, there's going to be a lot of low scores, if you can fight through the nerves, fight through trying to have a chance to win. But we're in a position. We're trying to catch a guy who's been playing great all week, and he's at 30-under. He's been leading the whole week. So we're trying to catch a guy that's been playing great. So hopefully we can catch him. 
 But we want to do it good. We don't want him to struggle we want to play good golf. We want a 59 to beat him. We want to play some great golf out there. We want to play great golf, but hopefully it does set up good for me.

 Q. Actually, where you're at right now, it usually wins the tournament?
 BUBBA WATSON: Yeah. Exactly. Thank you (laughter). 

 Q. How low can this tournament go tomorrow?
 BUBBA WATSON: Well, if there's no wind, we had a 11-under there before. I don't think anybody shot 12-under there this week, but we had a few 10-unders there, so a 59 could creep in. The only probably is tomorrow is Sunday. Tomorrow, there's the nerves. It's going to be hard to shoot 59. But there's going to definitely be some 9-under, 10-under again, a bunch of 7-unders. So it could go silly low. 

 Q. Is it better for you now that the pressure's on, but the amateurs aren't there and it's just you?
 BUBBA WATSON: It's more fun with the amateurs. You talk to them, you're having fun, goofing around. Today, my guys, I just talked to my guys the whole time, and I didn't even think about what I was doing. I was just hitting balls. They were saying, Good shot, and I was making some putts here and there. And it equalled up to 9-under.

 Q. You have to think that way tomorrow?
 BUBBA WATSON: Exactly. I have to act like these guys are my friends tomorrow.

 Q. Will it seem like a different golf tournament?
 BUBBA WATSON: Well, the last round is always different, even if you were playing with amateurs still because you know it's the last round. You don't have four other rounds to make up what you messed up. But it's always different when the pros are there. It's going to be more fans. Everybody is going to be in one area. So it's going to be bunched. You're going to see a different feel. It's going to be a different feel because it's a real golf tournament now because it's the last day, trying to win a golf tournament and it's all pros.
