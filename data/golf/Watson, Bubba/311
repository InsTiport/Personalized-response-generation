  BUBBA WATSON:   I played solid, kept myself in it.   Not as good as I wanted, but I'll take it.

Q.   Spencer is keeping himself in it.   Talk about the jitters of the final round. 
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, I haven't done that, so I don't know.   I always come from‑‑ my three wins are coming from behind.   But it's going to be tough, tough for everybody.   Everybody is going to be a bit nervous.   Everybody gets pumped up around here.   It gets warmer, the ball travels farther, so it's a tough thing, especially around here with everybody yelling and screaming.   It just pumps you up even more, so you have to find ways to calm yourself down.   And for him, not winning yet, yeah, it's going to be tough, but he's playing so good, you don't expect him to come back in the field.   You're going to have to go chase him down.

Q.   Can you talk about the performance on 16?   Was that something you guys had planned ahead?
BUBBA WATSON:   We planned it a couple holes before that.   We thought about doing it.   He actually came to me in the morning when I showed up and talked about doing it because we didn't know we were going to be playing together.   So yeah, we thought about doing it.   We just told our caddies, and we did it. 

Q.   What has the response been to the videos?
BUBBA WATSON:   Good.   I mean, the video was for charity.   It wasn't for us, it was just for charity.   It was to raise some money.   It's just different than playing golf for charity, so it was a different way to do it.   We've got ideas to do some more videos.
