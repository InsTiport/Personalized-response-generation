 Q.  How pleased are you with the way things turned out?  
BUBBA WATSON: Good.  Some of the fairways, I'm not really worried about hitting the fairways.  It's about a certain side of the golf hole you're looking for.  This rough is down, but it's still tricky to play out of it, but it's down enough where I can play.  So I'm not really looking for fairways as much as I am the better angle.   
 Q.  Talking about the greens getting a little bit bumpy in the afternoon; did that affect you in the back nine?  
BUBBA WATSON: I hit a bad tee shot on 11, so I had to lay up.  Hit a good shot in there but then I missed the putt.  Some of these holes coming down the stretch, it was more about playing safe on the birdie putts and making sure we didn't make a silly mistake with the 2-footer or 3-footer.   
 Q.  Look like you were going to go on a tear there early.  Tough day on the greens in the end?  
BUBBA WATSON: I don't think it was a tough day.  It was just one of those days, they just didn't go in.  Yesterday all of them went in.  The first two holes, I had to chip outside-wise on 1 and still made birdie somehow and made one from the fringe on 2.  It wasn't like it was a great day on the greens.   
It was just those two that somehow got lucky and made them.  But the short putts is what I liked.  I didn't miss any inside five feet.  I didn't make any bogeys.  So that would be pretty good over the weekend.   
 Q.  That's enough to be proud of.  Obviously your record around here is really good.  Playing a couple of really heroic shots from out of the trees, as well.  Your shape, the way you shape your ball around this place, is it a distinct advantage?  
BUBBA WATSON: No.  Only if I'm making putts.  I'm not leading so obviously it's not that big of an advantage.  I can move the ball, so there's a couple shots that I hit that some people might not be able to hit.  So it work out good, and again, saving pars.
