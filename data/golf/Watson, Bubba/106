Q. In control of your destiny.  2-up over Emiliano Grillo.  Take us through it.
BUBBA WATSON: It was nice.  Tough day.  The front nine, I hit some good shots.  He made some great putts.  The back nine, I hit some great shots.  Worked in my favor on some of them.
17, I looked like I never played golf before.  We kept guessing wrong.  The back nine was a tough guess with the wind.  It kept doing opposite of what we thought, but I survived.  So that was the key.
Q. How much is the wind playing a factor?
BUBBA WATSON: It was totally different.  I haven't seen it this way.  It's the first day I've seen it this direction.  The practice rounds were the opposite direction.  I think tomorrow it's going back to the other direction and lighter.  It was difficult.  The holes that were very long yesterday are shorter today.  So you had to play a different strategy.  You had to guess right on the wind.
The back nine, there's a few holes that I had great swings, but didn't guess right on the wind.
