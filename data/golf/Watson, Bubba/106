 Q. Kind of disappointing two days, I'm sure you came with high hopes.   
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, for sure. Very disappointing. Got to wait a year to attack it again. The golf course beat me this year and so I just got to improve, try to get better around this place. I hit the ball well, just didn't get the kicks or the bounces that I needed to, to make the putts and make more birdies and less bogeys.   
   
 Q. Did the illness earlier in the week have any affect on preparation or anything that you can speak of?  
BUBBA WATSON: The illness is a sinus infection and allergies and, yes, I'm still dealing with it right now. It affected me, but if I was in perfect health, I probably still could have missed the cut. So it's not ‑‑ I can't predict what I would have done if I would have been a hundred percent, that's neither here nor there. It just shows that I need to improve, I need to get better on windy conditions around this golf course. Little shots here and there hurt you in a big way, and that's what I did over the last two days.   
   
 Q. You described the impact of your illness and the course, but was there anything else that's affected your play?  
BUBBA WATSON: I'm not sure if there's anything else that can affect ‑‑ I'm not a smart man, but I don't think there's anything else that could have affected it. Conditions of the course are very difficult, no matter if there's wind or not. And I don't know if you can hear it, but there's some breeze going on right now. And so, yes, it's a very difficult golf course. This is a Major. This is the greatest tournament we play all year, so just the setup alone it's going to be very difficult and then when you add the wind it makes it that much more difficult.  
   
 Q. This year, in addition to the Majors, there's the Olympics.   
BUBBA WATSON: Yeah, and there's a Ryder Cup, too, that I wish I could win.  
   
 Q. Would you like to compete in the Olympics?  
BUBBA WATSON: Well, yeah, I would love to be on the Olympic team and I would love to be a part of that. I would love to have success there. Never seen the course. Again, Ive got to keep playing well to keep on the team. Right now I'm on the team, but I got to keep playing good to stay on the team. But, yeah, it would be an honor to play for the U.S. Olympic team. It would be a thrill.  
   
 Q. How did you feel about your game when you got here? Obviously, you had a win a few weeks ago and a good finish in Miami, did you feel pretty good about where you were at that point?  
BUBBA WATSON: I don't know how to answer some of these questions. I was fourth in the world, I'm still fourth in the world, so, yeah, I feel good. I don't know if you've ever been fourth in the world, but you have pretty good confidence, there's only three guys better than you in the world.   
So, I mean, yeah, I feel like every week that I play I can win. I feel like every week that I play I can be very successful. And this week the golf course just beat me. So I've got to ‑‑ I just got to try to improve. This is the toughest conditions I've seen this golf course since I've been here and so I got to get better in the wind around this golf course. I got to trust more things and hopefully I learn from that and if it does it next year, I'll be a little bit better.
