 Q.   Bubba, you had it going there for a while.   Seems like just one hole did you in.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah.   You know, if you look at the start, the start wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but then I made a chip‑in on 9, got me pumped up.   Good birdie on 10, birdied a couple of other holes.  
You know, all in all it was a great tournament, but yeah, missed club on 16.   We thought the wind was going to do something else with my ball, and obviously we misjudged it.  
   
 Q.   Did you ever go down there and take a look at it?   Some people at least on TV said it might be playable.   Did you ever assess it after the tee shot?  
BUBBA WATSON:   No.   I asked the camera guy.   Best of my knowledge is that it went back in the water.   We saw something go back in the water.   And again, the TV guy wanted to just videotape me instead of telling me if the ball went in the water.   I asked him.   But no, he finally said, yeah, it went in the water.   So we just took the drop.  
   
 Q.   And then on the third shot, what exactly happened on the third shot?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, it was different than the first shot.   First shot came up short.   Second shot went long.  
   
 Q.   As far as clubbing.   
BUBBA WATSON:   I mean obviously we changed clubs, but the wind affected the first shot and the wind didn't affect the next shot.   I flew it three feet past the hole, which you can't do right now because the greens are so firm.   
We were trying to land it about 15 feet short, make a bogey and try to get out of there and still have a chance.   And obviously the wind affected the first one, didn't affect the second one.  
   
 Q.   How hard is this?   You played great all week, and just one club selection.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Well, there's many holes.   There's many 3‑putts.   There's different things you can look at.   You know, the guys played great down the stretch and I didn't.   That's one of the things I just gotta learn from that.   You know, maybe look at the difference of we need to be long instead of short on that situation.   
But I hit a great shot.   The shot was fine.   The shot was solid.   So what I take from it is I played solid down the stretch.   Just a miss club.   One of those things.  
   
 Q.   Tried to hit a hard 9 at 16?  
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, because we were trying to fly it 158 to land it short of the hole.   We weren't trying to get to the hole.   We were trying to be short of the hole about 25 feet.
