 Q.  First time getting out of the brackets.  
BUBBA WATSON: For sure, the start of the week that's our goal.  We can't win it if you don't get out of the bracket.  Playing good golf.  Sometimes you are going to play good golf and lose.  Sometimes you play bad golf and win.  I got out of the bracket.  So I'm looking forward to it, looking forward to the challenge.  I don't know who I'm going to play yet, but it should be fun.   
 Q.  What's been working so well for you this week?  
BUBBA WATSON: It's just mentally knowing my ball striking is getting better because we changed the ball position and knowing that my putting is getting better because we changed the ball position.  All of that is giving me confidence knowing that I'm so close to having a solid rest of the year or a couple good tournaments.  It's fun looking forward that way.   
 Q.  What changes in preparation have you look toward for 36 holes both days?  
BUBBA WATSON: Just make sure I bring two shirts so I don't wear the same shirt for 36 holes.  It's just golf.  I have got to come out here and try to win.  You don't really look at energy or anything yet because you've got to win your match.  Hopefully the other guy is just as tired as you in the second match, if you get through.   
 Q.  Were you joking about Jordan giving you a putting tip?  What did he do?  
BUBBA WATSON: Jordan gave me a tip a while back.  I'm just throwing everybody's name under the bus.  I'm getting texts left and right, so it's awesome.  Yeah, he helped me a while back.  He gave me some drills to do and different things.  The only one he hasn't talked to me about is looking at the hole on some of the putts.  I'm not even sure if he still does that.
