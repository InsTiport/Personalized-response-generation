  THOMAS BJÃRN:   I played solid all the way around.   Never really made any mistakes‑‑ well, I hit one bad shot yesterday on the 8th but got a way with it.   But other than that, it was a really solid round.   Kind of had that feeling about this golf course this week that there's going to be some good numbers, so it's important to get something in early and go from here.   
   
 Q.   A course that met your eye right from the start?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, I felt good when I saw it to be honest.   It kind of suits the way I play.   I've been driving the ball pretty well lately, and you know, there's a lot of wedges on this golf course.   So it suits my eye pretty well, but it's a long way to go from here.  
   
 Q.   Presumably a little trickier today with the wind picking up?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, it was a bit different getting out there this morning.   It was a bit cold early on and obviously strong winds.   I think this golf course needs it a bit.   They have got to trick it up a little bit.   
So we'll go and fight this afternoon, and it will be a bit harder to shoot those numbers this afternoon.   But there will still be good scoring.
