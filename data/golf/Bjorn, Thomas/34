 Q.  Give us your reflection of the way the match turned, because you were so comfortable early on.  THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, we were very comfortable.  I don't think we let ourselves down.  We kept it rolling on the last few holes and we hit a lot of good shots and we had chances to close it out.  But in the end, that's what The Ryder Cup is all about.  You've got to stand up and do it. A little bit disappointed but I thought we mixed well, Martin and I, and we're comfortable with each other on the golf course and it was a great day out today with the crowds and all the support was there.  So we'll battle on from here and we're off to a decent start as a team.   Q.  You always get wonderful moments of magic, you two produced it early on, and Jimmy Walker seemed to throw a few in at you.    THOMAS BJÃRN: It all evens out at the end of the day and those things happen, and 24 great players are always going to give you some magic, and he did that today.  That's the way it is, a little bit disappointed but we'll be all right.
