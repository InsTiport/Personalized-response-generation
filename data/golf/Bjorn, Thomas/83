  Q. 10-under par for two days, over a scale of one to ten, where are you in terms of satisfaction?   
 THOMAS BJÃRN: I'm pretty happy. I didn't putt very well today and you've got to do that around here to get those low numbers, but I stuck with it all day. And 69, as I said yesterday, you probably have to shoot four rounds in the 60s and find a low one one of the days. It's a good start and puts me in a good place for the weekend.  
  
  Q. Do you like the pressure of birdies all the way?  
 THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, when you come down and the weather is the way it is and the golf course is the way that it is, you know you have to go for everything. It's there for the taking. But there are still a few holes out there that just gets your attention. A big part of this week is not making any mistakes, because it's very difficult to get it back quick.  
  
  Q. When you have won three times, does it give you a superiority complex?   
 THOMAS BJÃRN: No, I don't think it will ever give you that. You work hard and you play a lot, and when you have the good times, you've got to try and enjoy it and try and feel the things that's going on inside of you really. And I'm doing that at the moment.   
 But nothing lasts forever and you have to try to enjoy it while it lasts. It's good fun at the moment.
