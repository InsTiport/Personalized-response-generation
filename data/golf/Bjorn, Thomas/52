Q.   Thomas, you've taken revenge over Francesco who beat you in the first round a couple of years ago.   How sweet is that revenge?
THOMAS BJORN:   Actually, it's not very nice to come into this tournament and play your good friends in the first round, but that happens.   It was obviously you go out and play golf and try to win the match you play in. 
I played nice today.   I was bit rusty.   Been sick for a couple weeks.   Coming in, I didn't have really good preparation, so it was a bit rusty from early on.
From 7 on it was pretty solid.   Little bit trying to get over the line in the end, but I got it done.   I played some really good stuff in the middle there. 
Francesco never goes away.   That's one thing you got to give him.   He stuck in there.   Every time I got to 2‑up, he would have a great shot on the hole after and got himself back to 1.   So it was a tight match and it could have swung both ways.   He probably didn't putt as well as he would have liked to.   That's sometimes the way it goes in match play. 
Nice win, but looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   Jordan Spieth tomorrow.   What do you know about him?   Have you played with him?
THOMAS BJORN:   Not a lot.   But there it was lot great talent there, that's for sure.   He's taken on the PGA Tour very well the last season and early on this season, as well. 
Just go out and play and try and stay with your own golf and see what happens.   Match play is a funny game.   You can win shooting two over par and then you can lose shooting 5‑under.   You never know what's going to happen.   You've just got to go out there and play and try to play hard and see where it takes you.
