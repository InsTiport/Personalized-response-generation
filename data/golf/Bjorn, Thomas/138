Q.  Let's speak about you.  Some good, some bad, is that true?
THOMAS BJORN:  Yeah, I had some ups and downs for sure.  It was a hard working day.  I've been feeling a bit of tiredness this week, struggled a bit with the energy levels, and I certainly felt it in the round today.

But it was a pretty decent round, and we'll go from there.  It was hard work.
Q.  It's understandable, after all you did last week to be playing again, getting right back into the game?
THOMAS BJORN:  Yeah, I didn't give myself too many chances out there.
Q.  What was good today for you?
THOMAS BJORN:  The heart was still in the right place.  I drove in a lot of hearts today in a good way.  That was the best thing I did.  It wasn't particularly pretty, but it was a good round.
Q.  You're still able to take some positives from last week?  You did so well.
THOMAS BJORN:  You know, I take a lot of positives from that, but I also realize that we've got to go on from here.

Last week is over with and it didn't completely turn out the way we wanted it, but it turned out in a good way.  So we'll go from here and try and win some golf tournaments.
Q.  Well, you'll give yourself a chance anyway.  Good luck this week.
