 Q.  A good effort? 
 THOMAS  BJORN:  A lot of good things in the end so happy with that.  Kept myself in well. 

 Q.  Good little group, too. 
 THOMAS  BJORN:  Edfors layed awesome today.  It's easy when you play with somebody who gets off to a start like that and you start chasing him and a solid round of golf and got the rewards in the end, really.  Good on him. 
 It's one of those days.  We enjoy each other's company, and when things are going well, you feed off each other and all of a sudden the golf course is not difficult but it certainly felt a lot easier today when it's coming in from all angles, so it just felt easier than it probably is.
