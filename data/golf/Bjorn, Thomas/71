Q.   68 is a great score today but did it feel like one too many?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, it certainly feels like that.   But you know, I knew what I had to do today.   I thought with these conditions, if I could get somewhere around 66, I would have a chance, but yeah, I left‑‑ I got a way with a couple today and unfortunately I hit two putts on the last few holes that didn't go in. 
It's quite interesting, you play this golf course, and they moved a lot of tees up over the weekend.   16, that's probably the one that‑‑ it was straight into and cold and raining.   So it's just one of them things, but it's the same for everybody. 

Q.   Ross Fisher has just been given a penalty shot for slow play we understand.   Thongchai obviously has the lead but you're not going to be leaving quite yet, are you. 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No, I'll see how Thongchai gets through 16 and 17.   It's a tough few holes, but he's got a nice cushion.
