Q.   Thoughts on 66 to close? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I played well.   I played well all week.   Today I holed a few more putts than the first few days, but I played good.   It was a solid performance this week.   Just a wee bit short.   That's the way it is. 
I guess it's‑‑ I did a lot of hard work coming in before this tournament coming in here, and it looked like it paid off.   I played solid from tee‑to‑green, so looking forward to the next few weeks.

Q.   Were you conscious of having an opportunity into, say, the back nine? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, when I birdied four out of five holes on the front nine, I thought I could keep going but that bogey on 10 threw me a little bit and then I started fighting a little bit in the middle of the round.
But, you know, I closed it out nicely, and shoot 66 on a golf course like this is always a good score. 

Q.   And you've touched on this but it does bode well for busy, important weeks to come?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   It's always nice to start the first one when you are playing some decent stuff and you don't feel like you're fighting against everything coming into the next few, so you can go and do your work and get prepared for the next one.

Q.   Is it exciting for you as somebody, official status on The European Tour, to know that this Final Series is up and running? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, it's a good run of events, great tournaments.   It might need some tweaking in the future to get it absolutely right, but the tournaments are great, and we are happy to have this finish to the year. 
We are getting good support from our top players and that's the most important thing that really we get them playing.   We might have to tweak it a little bit to get it absolutely right, but we'll look at that when we are done in Dubai.
