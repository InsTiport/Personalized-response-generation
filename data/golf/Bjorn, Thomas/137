Q.
If yesterday was satisfactory, that must be really good.
THOMAS BJORN:  Solid today.  It was solid today.  I missed three greens today and two of those were aggressive sand irons.  It was much better than yesterday.  I was very pleased with the way I played today.
Q.  You feel pretty happy right through the game.  Your card would suggest it was pretty consistent?
THOMAS BJORN:  It was good, really, really good.  The first time I struggled was on the last hole really.  You know, all in all, it was just a very, very solid round all the way around, so I'm happy with that.
Q.  You got to the weekend in good position, as well.
THOMAS BJORN:  Yeah, we'll go from here.  I'm happy with the way I'm playing.  I draw confidence with these things and we'll take it from there.  I take a lot of confidence from last week, and today felt really good, so we'll go from there.
