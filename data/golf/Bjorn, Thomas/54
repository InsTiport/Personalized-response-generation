Q.   1‑over par for the first eight holes, 6‑under par the last ten; what changed? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I played all right early on.   Just didn't really hole any putts.   Got three in a row there, and just freed the round a little bit.   I played awful yesterday and one of the better rounds I've probably done ever to scramble my way around.   There was a few thoughts that was going on this morning, but I played all right early on.   Started hitting a few fairways and on the back nine I played really well and that was nice to turn around what was really poor yesterday to some pretty good stuff today.

Q.   Last week you shoot 79 in the first round and finished Top‑10.   Two years ago in Qatar you shot 79‑65 to make the cut.   You won The Irish Open shooting 78 in the first round.   How do you do these turnarounds? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Wish I had an answer to that and wish I didn't shoot those numbers in the first round.   It would be a lot more fun to play when you get off to a steady start.   I've gotten into my head at the moment, I've just got to keep going and keep grinding it out.   Yesterday was one of those, as well, could have been an awful number but I just kept grinding and did some good stuff to get myself in the clubhouse.
When I play like I did today, all of a sudden the numbers become a lot better.   It's just in there, I don't give up and I've got that thing in me that I just wanting to all the way to the end.

Q.   Commentators were speculating during the round just how much you want to get on The Ryder Cup Team; tell us just how much. 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Be stupid to say you don't want to get in it, because I'm in a good position.   No, I promised myself I will take this season in little spells, and I'll concentrate on these three weeks in the Middle East right now and that's all I can do.   I can't get ahead of myself.   I'm at an age where I know that things can sort of stop very quickly at this age and with my injuries over the years. 
I'll just take little spells at the moment and try to concentrate on that and then try to get myself in positions where I can win some golf tournaments. 

Q.   So what are your thoughts on shooting a lovely low score on what is a difficult golf track?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It is a difficult golf course, but I hit a lot of fairways today and ended up losing a very good number.   I played really, really well on my last nine.   It was a good day.   I kept myself where it's supposed to be and then just holed a few good putts here and there and hit a lot of good shots and didn't get ahead of myself on the tough holes, and just walked off with nice pars there. 
So it was a good day's work.   I'm happy with the way I played today, and considering the way I played yesterday, it's a big change.   No, it was nice, getting a little bit of that feel of good golf again.   It probably hasn't really been there for the last week and the beginning of this week. 

Q.   Well, yesterday wasn't a bad score but essentially in the event last week in Durban, you started slowly and then got it together; something about your approach? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No, I try obviously every time to go out and be prepared and be ready in the mind.   But just when the swing is not feeling quite right, you get on certain golf courses last week, it was a tricky golf course off the tee.   When you are not completely confident in what you're doing, it becomes difficult to play.   Today was so much better off the tee and all of a sudden the golf course turns a little bit easier.

Q.   A course that's become tougher down the years and matured well. 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It's certainly tough this week.   It's a good golf course.   There's a big emphasis on hitting the ball straight this week and you've got to have weeks like that; I think a few guys might feel it comes a little bit early in the year for that but that's the way it is.   It's set up brilliant, it's in fantastic condition and you've just got to take what comes your way and try and stay in the fairways. 

Q.   You don't appear to have an awful lot to do to make it into Gleneagles; is that something that's very much opponent your mind?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   A lot of people seem to think that I don't have a lot to do. I think when you're on this side of the fence, you kind of just try to stick your head down and try and do the job.   You're never going to get there before you are actually over the line, and no, I've just got to keep working hard and keep doing the stuff that I'm doing, and then see where it takes me.   I'm here to win golf tournaments and that's what I'm trying to do, and that's the most important thing at the moment to try and get myself in contention as many times as possible.   And if I keep doing that, well, then it will take care of itself.
