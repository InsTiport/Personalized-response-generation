  Q. Looks like you played nicely?  
 THOMAS BJÃRN: I played really well today. Mostly it was pretty solid. I didn't putt well enough today, and you know, I thought I had to shoot probably 67,66 to win it, and in the end, I just didn't putt well enough.   
 But I played really nicely. A shame on 17. But I had a lot of good chances early on and didn't really hole anything. You know, but all in all, it's been a great week.   
 Yeah, I played well this week. You've just got to take that.
