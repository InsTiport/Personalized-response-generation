 Q.   What is your verdict on this week, sir?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It's a disappointment when you come off the golf course like this.   Just didn't get it right today and I made that massive judgment error on 6, and that kind of let everybody back into the frame and I kind of knew that if I shot 72 today, it was going to be very difficult to deal with, and all of a sudden the game plan changed.  
To be honest, I thought I played‑‑ from tee‑to‑green it was pretty solid and good today.   I putted awful for a long ways, and 14 and 15, still had a good chance.   Just kind of didn't do me any favours.  
That's the way it is.   Sometimes it's disappointing but we'll kick on from here.   It's been one of those weeks, my good has been absolutely brilliant, and this has been a little bit too much poor stuff in there.   
That was a fantastic round on Thursday and yesterday was magnificent coming in, and today was like Friday, still a work‑in‑progress.   Need to find some stability in my golf swing and my putting to close the deal.   I've closed out tournaments plenty of times but wasn't to be this week.  
   
 Q.   You said you drew on the previous day going into the back nine and presumably you still sensed the opportunities?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, and I hit great shots.   I hit a good shot into 11, missed the putt and hit a really good shot on 12, good shots on 13, great shot on 14, just catches a little bit of the bunkers.   
Brilliant 4‑iron into 15 and that wasn't‑‑ 3‑putted that.   It was just one of those days where the great shots didn't get close to the hole and give me the opportunities to get myself back in the frame.   
It's nice to see Rory to come in and do what he does best, and you know, we've just got to keep on from here and try and learn from it and not get too down on it.   
   
 Q.   Just briefly on Rory, that's some performance, isn't it?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It is.   There's a lot of stuff going on at the moment and he just needs to get himself into his golf and he's done that this week.   We all know what he's capable of, and he will do great things from here.   This will stand him good going into the U.S. Open with a lot of confidence.   It was a remarkable performance from him this week.
