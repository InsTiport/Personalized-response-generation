 Q.  Thoughts right now as things stand?  
THOMAS BJÃRN: We've got to take all that in, and you look at Brookline, Medinah, plenty of examples of these score lines not meaning a lot until you get to singles.  Just keep going.  Keep going hard, keep going with what we've got, and you know, I've seen too many times what the singles does.   
It's a completely different game tomorrow and that makes a lot of refocusing and getting back into that team room and recover.  We used a lot of energy these days.  We go again tomorrow.  Try and focus on what's ahead.   
 Q.  How will your team really listen to that, stay in the present?  
THOMAS BJÃRN: They have been great at really focusing between matches and get back out there and deliver.  You know, I really thought that 2-2 this afternoon was something that would be really good for us.  It was something that when we started those foursomes, I felt like, if we can come out of this with 2-2, it would be a good place for us to be.   
So they are very good at refocusing.  When I had the conversations with them after their matches now, that's the first thing they all say, let's keep going and keep focusing on what's ahead tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've said it all week, but just reiterate finally the belief you have in all 12 of your players to go out there tomorrow to deliver and get this Ryder Cup for the Europeans.  
THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, that's what we need.  We need every single man on the golf course to do their bit, and we've got to get out there and really, really, really play hard and be determined to win this back.  When you look at those 12 American names, that's a strong lineup.  So it can go any way, but really, really, really happy with how it's gone these first two days.
