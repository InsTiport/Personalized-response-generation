 Q.  Talk about your round and how the course played the first day?  
THOMAS BJORN: Yeah, it was a nice day.  It was beautiful this morning, not too warm and the golf course seems pretty receptive.  You never really know when you step out on a golf course in a major championship what to expect, but you kind of felt in the first few holes that it was going to be doable.  And then the wind came up a little bit in the end and the last few holes played tricky.   
In general really comfortable with what I did today.  Disappointed with the last couple of holes, but those two holes can be really tough.  As a whole I'm pretty happy with what I did today.
