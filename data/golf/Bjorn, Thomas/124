   THOMAS BJORN:  I never gave myself any chance to take control of anything. Trevor played nicely without doing anything special. It was probably the easiest game he will ever win. It was poor. It was disappointing. I thought I was turning a corner there in Dubai and today just wasn't very good. Shit happens. In match play it is difficult. You lose a couple of holes and get on the back foot. It is difficult to then get it back and get it going. You are battling not only yourself but the guy you are playing against and it becomes difficult for me to get back into it. Trevor played nicely without anything spectacular and did what he had to do in a match like that. Disappointing to come all this way for that. 
 It was just not good enough, simple as that. I will go back home and get back on the range. I will probably next be out at Bay Hill but that depends on how I feel. I am now going back home to London. I flew out from there. It's been a short week.
