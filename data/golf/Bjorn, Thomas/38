 Q.   Is this week just about getting the game in shape a little bit?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It is, especially the way I played the last few weeks.   It's a lot of focus on the swing and a lot of focus on keeping tempo and doing the right things on the golf course and not getting miss‑hits and stuff like that.   I felt like last week went fast and I wasn't in control.   Not really what I wanted it to be but it's turned into that.   Big improvement.   
It's natural that you take a little dip after an intense period, and I had to go back and play in Denmark after the PGA, and so I've played a lot of golf.   Probably natural to have kind of a dip.   
   
 Q.   Stephen struggled alongside you, any worries about that?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No.   He's had a couple of weeks off, and being Scottish and all, he's looking forward to it, and his mind is probably already there, being a rookie, as well.   That's only natural.   I wouldn't worry about that at all.   It's just one of those things.   A little rusty today and a couple shots here and there that cost him a lot.   That's the way it is.   He'll get back on his feet and not really worry about it too much.
