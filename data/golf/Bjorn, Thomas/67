 Q.   5‑under par through ten holes, finished 4‑under, missed opportunity or satisfied?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It was a missed opportunity.   I played well enough on the first ten holes, and then started hitting a few poor shots that cost me a couple bogeys.   So that was a bit disappointing.   
But you know, when we set out, you try to set out to where you have a position on Sunday and I have a chance, but I'm a bit behind, and so I have to go out and do the same on the front nine tomorrow and do a bet bitter on the back.   
   
 Q.   You told us at the start of the week you felt you needed to win to make Ollie think the thought; you don't think a top two or three would make him think the thought?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No, I think there's too many good players.   I think, you know, you've got to make the right noises in the last tournament, and I just feel there's a new‑‑ coming into the last tournament to qualify and to make him think about a name.   I think he's pretty much where he wants to be with the team.   He's pretty certain what he wants to do, and there's only a few people that can really rock the boat if they win the last tournament.  
   
 Q.   You told us at the start of the week that you expect to be asked, having played with Nicolas Colsaerts the first two rounds you would be asked how he's playing; were you asked?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, we had a nice long dinner last night, and we talked about a lot of things, including obviously Nicolas Colsaerts but a lot of other players.   It was a nice dinner.   I think he listened to all of us, and he's got to make a decision Monday morning.   
We can only give him information and say what we see out there.   He has to make that decision, and you know, he's pretty cool and he's studied everybody down to the last detail and he knows what he wants to do and what team he wants to bring.   And that's a good thing I think.   He's very much in good spirit about what he's got, and so I think in general, it will be pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Would you like to have Miguel on board?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, of course.   
   
 Q.   He would be good, wouldn't he.   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   What I remember with vice captains is you need somebody that the captain trusts, and that's his best friend on Tour.   So, why not?   I think that's the‑‑ it needs to be people that have done it and know what the players who are going to go through, but also‑‑ not have any favourites.   You've got to go in and just be completely honest and give him information and Miguel is never scared of voicing his opinion.   I think that's an important thing, so I'm sure he will think that thought what we speak about that on Monday.
