 Q. Tell me, another 66, this game is just so easy. 
 THOMAS BJÃRN: Oh, I don't know. I played nicely today. I didn't get off to the best of starts, when you don't birdie the first few holes, you kind of feel like you're playing catch-up all day. I stuck in there and I got my reward in the end. 

 Q. How about the flags out on the golf course, tough or okay? 
 THOMAS BJÃRN: I think they are tougher today than they probably have been, but I think they needed to a little bit. The scoring is red-hot. Their only real protection is to try to tuck a few of the flags and they did that today. There will be some tough ones tomorrow I'm sure.

 Q. Do you think you're one of those names when people ahead of you look over their shoulder and think, here comes Thomas BjÃ¶rn?
 THOMAS BJÃRN: There are good names on the leaderboard and are used to winning. They know what they have to do to win. You have not going to win by shooting 71 or 72, you have to get out there and make some birdies. People came from all over the field today to get right in contention. 
 You know what you have to do tomorrow and I don't think you can allow yourself or anybody in the field can allow yourself to look at who is around and you who is going to make birdies. Make sure to shoot a number that's difficult to catch.

 Q. The whole game in good shape? 
 THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, I feel like I've been playing quite nicely this week. Didn't but well yesterday but rolled in a couple of nice ones in the end here today and that's the way it is. Yeah, in general I'm very happy with where I am.
