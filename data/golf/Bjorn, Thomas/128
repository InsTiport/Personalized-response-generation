Q. Did it get away from you around the turn?
THOMAS BJÖRN: For the first eight holes I played as good as you can play golf and then I hit that shot on nine and that kind of rocked the boat a bit and form there it was a bit of a struggle all the way to try and do the sensible things. I think 16 and 18 kind of sum the day up.
Q. Just tugged it a bit on 16?
THOMAS BJÖRN:  Yes. It just didn't feel comfortable after I hit the tee shots on nine and ten and I never found my comfort zone again and everything from there was difficult. Then all of a sudden this golf course, with its length becomes difficult and that's the way it was today. Now I just have to go and prepare for next week.
Q. Good week to prepare for?
THOMAS BJÖRN:  Yes, but you know what both of us are like - we want to win golf tournaments so we are disappointed.
Q. Johan did well, though?
THOMAS BJÖRN: when you are in a situation like that he did all the things that he had to do right. The guy has played magnificently and he would be a good addition for our Ryder Cup Team.
