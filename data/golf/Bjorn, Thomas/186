 Q. Tell me a little bit about how the course was playing today.
 
 THOMAS BJORN: The greens are a little harder than you would expect. When Tiger goes out
and shoots 6-under in the first round, you know that they're going to make it difficult
for us to shoot low numbers. But it's played really well. It's in fantastic condition, and
the greens are -- if you hit good shots into them, it's not a problem; but if you hit bad
shots, you're just not getting away with it. The course is playing really good, I think.
It's played as easy as it can be.  
 
Q. You're in third position at the moment after suspension of play today. Any thoughts
on preparations for tomorrow and for the two more rounds to come?
 
 THOMAS BJORN: I'm just going to try and keep doing what I'm doing, just trying to play
one shot at a time. It's difficult enough out here to play golf. You kind of start
worrying about where you are and what others are doing, because you soon make bogeys or
double bogeys. So you have to keep doing what you're doing. I'm playing well. The golf
course is fantastic. I have to keep doing what I'm doing.  
 
Q. Any particular highlights in your round today that sort of stick out in your mind?
 
 THOMAS BJORN: I got off to a great start, 3-under after 6. I think that's the key to
the course. You can score in the first six or seven holes, and you need to score. I got
off to a good start, and I think that was what kept me going.
