Q.   I was just talking to a man who followed you around the whole way and he said you played unbelievably well.   Tell us about it?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I got off to a fantastic start.   The irons were good today, and to shoot 30 on the front nine on this golf course is pretty special.   So I played well pretty much all day long.   A few iffy bits there in the middle but delighted with the day.   It was worth getting up this morning.

Q.   A lot more birdies out there today.   Tell us why. 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I don't know, it's pretty difficult to say really.   I don't think the pins are any easier but the weather is really good.   There's not a lot of wind out there, so you feel like you can take on the golf course, but you've still got to drive it really well to make those birdies.   And that's the key to this golf course; get in the fairway. 
You know, I just think people just brushing off a little bit of rust and getting going.   And a lot of the guys, first one of the year, they come into the weekend and they are here for a weekend and they have maybe let their shoulders down a little bit and maybe start playing golf and playing a bit more freely.   I think that's what you're seeing in the scoring.

Q.   Having such a great win last year, three wins, momentum and you get the break; how important to come back and start the ball rolling again?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It's very important.   It's very easy when you have a good year.   You kind of think that it's going to come easy.   You have to come out and be firing and keep those confidence levels up.   It goes very quickly in this game. 
So got to keep the confidence there to keep performing, and you've got to shoot those rounds that just makes you feel a little bit better about where your game is.   A round like this is important for confidence going forward. 

Q.   You played very well last year, last week you also started the season quite well.   Two solid rounds yesterday and the day before.   How is your game in general?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It's been good.   I feel comfortable with the long game.   I've struggled really on the greens for the last couple days.   A change of putter to today certainly helped. 
I started rolling in a couple here and there, and it made it a whole lot easier and getting off to a good start in the round was important.   It calms you down a little bit, and you know you make a big move if you shoot a number, and that's‑‑ I've done that. 
No, I felt a lot more comfortable with what I was doing today on the greens, that's for sure. 

Q.   7‑under par today, probably not just the putting.   Your game must have been good?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No, the game was good.   But it's been pretty good for the other couple of days, but just not really roll anything in.   Today I just rolled in a few and on the first few holes and just calms you down a little bit and gives you a bit of confidence and belief in going forward in the round. 
Then it also eases up on everything else you are doing.   You feel like you can take on more shots because if you miss them, you can still get up‑and‑down if you're putting well.   I felt comfortable on the golf course today, which I haven't done the other two days. 

Q.   Can you give us a few words on ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen?   He's doing fantastically. 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   The kid is a wonderful player, very, very big talent.   He's got everything in the book to become a great player, and he just needs to enjoy these moments when he's up there and take all of the confidence from it. 
He's got everything to become one of the best players in the world.
