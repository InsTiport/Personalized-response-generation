  THOMAS BJÃRN:   It was pretty good today.   I got a bit of a funny start, no pars in the first six holes, and managed to be, what, 1-under with three birdies, three bogeys.   It was a decent start.   Yeah, it was what you set out to do.   You can only try this week, especially, try and build.   That's what I'm trying to do so that's a good start.  
   
 Q. So when you consider the length of the day and the conditions that you had to deal with and how cold it is?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It's been a long day to be honest, and this golf course is not really made for suspensions.   There's a long way through some of these corners on this golf course.   Yeah, it was a bit unfortunate, but that happens, and you know, good day.   
   
 Q. Good having Billy Foster back in the game and on your bag?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I think we all know what Billy does as a caddie, and it was nice to bring him back and it's nice to see him back out here and nice to see that the knee is holding up well.   You can't have a better man on the bag around here.
