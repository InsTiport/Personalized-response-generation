 Q.  Two very nice rounds out there so far?  
THOMAS BJORN: Yeah, yesterday was all right.  Today I got a really bad start, but got it around.  And that was the most important thing of the day.  In position where we can hopefully move forward if this weather stays away that's supposed to come in this weekend.   
 Q.  It is a big if, isn't it?  Were you conscious of that when you were actually playing out there, trying to shoot low?  
THOMAS BJORN: Yeah, I think I was conscious that this could change to being a shorter tournament.  You can only play the golf course and play the round that you're playing.  You can't force it too much.   
This golf course gives you so many opportunities, but it's also -- if you're a little bit off and too aggressive, you can get into some serious trouble.   
It was a good day's work.  Happy with where I am.  Leaps and bounds from where I was last week.  Good things.   
 Q.  Absolutely.  There's so many positives regardless of what happens on the weekend.  So many steps forward?  
THOMAS BJORN: Yeah, absolutely.  I needed to -- it's been a tough year and I haven't played the way I wanted to play.  I went back with my old coach this week and that's certainly helped a lot, believing in the stuff that I'm doing on the golf course a little bit more.  So hopefully we can put in a good run over the rest of the year.   
 Q.  I appreciate it's a totally different track on which you won in Portugal, but does that help, the fact that you've won in the country?  
THOMAS BJORN: Not at all.  That was a long time ago now.  This golf course has not really done me that well, but it's strange because it kind of suits my eyes wit the way I play.  These two days were quite important for me and hopefully we get to play another round.
