  THOMAS BJÃRN:   Got off to a good start and made a couple of mistakes out there that cost me a little bit.   I made a good choice on the right holes and I think that's the key to this golf course is three or four holes out there that can get you and I hit good shots on them.   
It was there for the taking, but good start.   
   
 Q.   Is that as good as you're going to get, the conditions?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   The first ten or 12 holes was flat calm, so that was‑‑ it doesn't get any better than that.   Hitting the fairways, they are quite wide and you can hit on the greens, pretty receptive.   It was there to be done this morning.   
   
 Q.   Do you have memories of World Cups here, or totally different?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   No, I walk on the first tee and I never recognize one hole.   No, that's too long ago.   
   
 Q.   I wanted to ask you, did you have a chance to play all 18 holes this week?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, I managed to get 18 in, just.   Had to go out and play five or six and then come back in and then play eight or nine.   So it wasn't the best preparations, but it was the same for everybody.   I think a lot of guys skipped what they normally do and just played maybe 18 or 27 holes.   
   
 Q.   With that kind of preparation, were your expectations a little different coming into today?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Not really.   You knew what you could go out there and do.   You go out there and play as good as you can, and that doesn't change; if you played 18 holes or 54 holes.   You just go out and play as good as you can.   
   
 Q.   Do you think, obviously if you had a very good tournament here, that would change a lot of people's minds, especially the captain's mind for a Ryder Cup, do you look at that at all and think about that at all?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I don't really get into that.
