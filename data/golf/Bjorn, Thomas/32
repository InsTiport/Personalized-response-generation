  THOMAS BJÃRN: That was the first green I've missed today on 15.  So there's not much you can say, just played awesome.  There was a couple of shots there on 7 and 8, 7 got off the bank and pretty much a gimmie and he holed a shot on 8.  One of those days, you can't really say much. Thought I played well.  Didn't putt maybe as well as I wanted to but I tried to keep it but it was just not to be you can't say anything, though.  When you go up against guys that play like that, you just have to take your hat off and say well done.Q. Are you going to head out there and cheer them on and hope to bring it home?THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, that was the plan when we started the day.  Yeah, it's looking good, but there's a long way to go, and this tournament has a way of turning it all around all of a sudden.  So we'll cheer them on and hopefully we can get it done.
