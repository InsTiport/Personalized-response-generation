Q.   Slightly different format? 
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, it's fine.   You come down, it's a week of 35 players.   It works quite well to be honest with two pros and one amateur.   You can see that it's a massive day for them, so you can take joy from that.   Still, it comes on a good day.   It comes on Friday. 
Now, tomorrow is gets a bit more important, so it comes on a good day.   But it's fine.   I don't have any issues with it.   I know how much it meant to Per and to Volvo, so it's the right thing to do. 

Q.   You enjoyed your day?
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Absolutely.
