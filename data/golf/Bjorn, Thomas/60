 Q.   Your thoughts on a round of 71 today?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It was tough today.   It was tough conditions from the start really.   It was just a day of trying to grind something out and didn't play particularly well, so it was decent for the way I played.   It was a tough day.   
It got really, really windy there around lunch time, and it was a battle all the way around for everybody in the afternoon, so it's one of those things that happens.   We've been a bit unfortunate on this side of the draw this week, but you win some and you lose some.   
I felt like I could use a better number than I did, but those last five holes were tough.  
   
 Q.   That's the nature of your game at the moment that you can grind it out and stay solid, isn't it?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, there's a lot of confidence to get a decent score out of not playing very well, and that's what you need.   I've not made any big damage today.   I obviously would like to be a little bit closer than I am, but no big damage and we'll go out and see if we can produce something this weekend.  
   
 Q.   Elaborate on that, because that is a fine position just off the leaders?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, I'm four shots off the lead.   Tomorrow is a big day, and you've got to get yourself in position, but I've got to play a bit better than I did today, and that's the most‑‑ the key to get out tomorrow and feel comfortable in the round and just try to get it to the end.   
So it's a good day ahead tomorrow, and just want to get out there and try and produce a number.  
   
 Q.   Any fun playing in front of a crowd like this with the home fates?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, it's brilliant.   Every time you come to Ireland, it's fantastic.   The crowds are brilliant.   They come out in big numbers every time we play golf in Ireland, and that's what you want to see.
