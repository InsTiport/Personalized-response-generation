Q.  Talk about your round?
 
THOMAS BJORN:   It was a bit  -- played well early on and missed a few short putts, and then in the middle I played poorly, but the thing about this golf course is that you know 17 and 18  -- if you can keep yourself going and maybe finish off with a couple of birdies, you can always get the round in.  I finished off 4, 3 and that just goes from being a mediocre round to being a decent round.  That's Wentworth.  I think that's normally why the scores are pretty good here because everybody knows coming down the last two or three holes, they know they can pick them up again.  So if you drop a few shots, people keep going, and I know that around here.  I've played here enough times to know that's the case, so I just kept going. 
 
Q.  Nice start under your belt, though? 
 
THOMAS BJORN:   Yeah, it was a good start.  It's a good start.  I mean, there's some really good scoring out there, which amazes me a little bit, because it's actually not that easy to get it close.  So it amazes me, because it's a good start and you just keep going.  
 
Q.  What was the second shot on 18? 
 
THOMAS BJORN:   I just hit a driver and a 5-wood to about three feet.  
 
Q.  5-wood how far? 
 
THOMAS BJORN:   215 metres to the pin.
