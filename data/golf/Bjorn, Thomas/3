THOMAS BJÃRN: It didn't fly the way I wanted it to fly, but interesting.  But nice to get back out there walking around.  It was a nice day out there, to be honest.
Q. What's the reaction, obviously, putting yourself out there amongst the golfing public in the wake of what happened in France?
THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah, it was nice.  Yeah, it becomes a little bit like that.  That's obviously nice.  But the three of us walking around and getting -- people having a good time watching it.  It's nice to make people happy, so yeah, we took that in stride today.  It's always good fun.  But in the end, we're out there to try and play golf.
Q. But that must be a very gratifying thing, mustn't it, getting that sense of what it's meant to an awful lot of people?
THOMAS BJÃRN: Yeah.  You know that the Ryder Cup means a lot to a lot of people, but you stick your head down when you're there and trying to do the job, but yeah, you get the sensation that most people felt like this was a pretty good one.  Yeah, it was great to be out there.
Q. How long do you think it'll take you to be back as Thomas BjÃ¶rn, Mr. Golfer, rather than Mr. Winning Captain?
THOMAS BJÃRN: It'll be a while before I probably get through all of that.  But that's okay.  That's a good place to be, so we'll -- I need to spend these next couple of months kind of figuring out what's in store for me and how I see it going forward.  You know, in terms of the way I play and I way I hit it, there's a lot of work that needs to be done if I want to be a golfer again.  So am I willing to do that?  I have to make up my mind if I want to go through that six months of really hard grind to get back to being able to hit it the way I need to hit it to be able to compete with these guys.  But I'll take these next six, eight weeks to figure that out.
