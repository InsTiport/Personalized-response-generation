  Q.  What's your feelings?   
 THOMAS BJÖRN:  At the 12th I felt like I lost a bit of energy, I got a bit tired and I hit a couple of loose shots on 14 and on 17.  And also when you feel a bit tired, and also 18 doesn't feel like that good of a hole to come up to.  I holed a good putt for par and that was nice.   
 Get some rest and get ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  You're in a good position heading into the final day.   
 THOMAS BJÖRN:  Yeah, in a good position with everybody else.   
 You know, there's a day tomorrow to go and be played and that's what we've got to do.  When he's like this -- he hit some incredible shots, there's not many players in the field that can hit those shots.  We all know when he's at his best, he's very difficult.   
  
  Q.  What do you think made you tired?   
 THOMAS BJÖRN:  I've been here -- I actually came in Saturday.  It's been a long week for me.  So, you know, I probably worked a little bit too hard and not reserved enough energy for tournament golf.  And I also had four weeks off coming into this tournament, so I need to get into the beat of things again.   
 That's pretty much where I am.  You know, I'm quite happy with what I've done this week, considering that I've just had four weeks off.  So, you know, this is a good build for Augusta, and that's the important thing right now.
