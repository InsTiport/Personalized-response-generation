 Q.   Thomas, better today, what was the difference?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I got a better start today more than anything.   Yesterday, after five weeks after, it was just very rusty and couldn't find the pace on anything.   So it was better today.   It wasn't much better, but it was better.  
   
 Q.   You've been well used to the cut and thrust of match play over the years, but there's something to be enjoyed and you go or you don't, but this idea that you get a second chance, how do you like that?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   When you go out and play well the first day‑‑ not that I did yesterday, but you can go out and play well and lose; in normal match play, you would be out.   That's tough.   Might be a good way of doing it, you just get that second chance just to get in.   
You know, it's a golf tournament and we are used to golf tournaments lasting four days, and it's tough when they only last one.  
   
 Q.   How did your match go today?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   It was a bit scruffy I think from both sides.   It wasn't really‑‑ we gave each other a few holes here and there but there were some big putts being made on that back nine.   I made a big putt on 13 and that's probably why I got my tail up a bit and Branden felt like it was going against him a little bit.   
Match play is all about getting your tail up, and there comes a point in the match where it changes from friendly down to work, and it normally changes there around 11 or 12, and I got things going my way there and he struggled a little bit.   
   
 Q.   So you're done playing for the day; what do you do now?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I go and practise.   I feel that I still need to do a lot of work, and if I do get in tomorrow and play tomorrow, well, then I need to play better than I have today.   Because then you start playing guys that are actually playing well; so I need to get some work done, and we have a big week coming up next week, so get some work done for that, as well.   
   
 Q.   And maybe a couple hours to consider the Liverpool manager's position?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I don't know about that.   I don't think they want me, but hopefully we'll get a good one this time.
