 Q.   What's your verdict on the week?  
THOMAS BJÃRN:   I played well, got off to the start I needed today and got right there in front.   The thing that's been great this week is the driver and let me down on the back nine.   
The bogey on 11 didn't come at a good time and obviously the one on 13, but I fought all the way to the end, and you know, he hit two very classy shots on the last.   When you go up against Ernie, you've got to take it 18 holes to the end and I didn't quite do it today.   
I'm on a good run of form.   
   
 Q.   Good in itself to go up against Ernie on the final day, isn't it?   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, I've played a lot of golf with him over the years, not really too bothered about who I play with or who I play against, but he did all his stuff on Thursday with a 63 and he just hung in there from there and some solid rounds from there.   You know, you need that low round around here, and I didn't quite get it low enough yesterday, and today wasn't enough.   
   
 Q.   Might not be a consolation, but it went to the wire, even that wonderful approach at the last.   
THOMAS BJÃRN:   Yeah, you get to the point when I hit the second shot, I knew I had to try and make sure I finished second at least and I hit a good shot and proud of that.   
I wanted to try and get myself in the Top‑20 in The Race to Dubai and Top‑5 for The Open, and I'm keeping closer to that and that's my goal over the next couple of weeks.   The qualifier takes a lot out of you, and I'm going to Ireland on a golf course I won on and I'll keep carrying on and fighting hard until I win a golf tournament.
