 Q. 1-under today, pleased with that?
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Pleased but I had a hiccup in the middle there but pleased overall. Finished my birdie.

 Q. What was the hiccup?
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Par 3,4th. My tee shot was in the bunker and a fried egg lie, plugged big time and didn't get out the first time and ended up having a double-bogey. 
 But just managed to keep my head and made a good par save on the next hole and just played okay on the way in.

 Q. Nice to finish with a birdie. 
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Yeah, really good, tap-in, which was nice.

 Q. How did you feel after that double? 
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Just tried to let it go, because it was bad luck off the tee. So just take the good breaks with the bad. 

 Q. Where do you feel this places you now and where would you hoping to from here?
 PAMELA FEGGANS: First time in Dubai, first time playing this tournament, so just happy to be here and going to enjoy every second.

 Q. Is that the first time you made it into the field then?
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Yeah, last year, I would have made. I was reserve but I was back in Scotland and didn't make it. This year I got in just at the closing date. 
 I'm excited to be here. My putting has been so much better this week. I struggle a lot with my putting but today, 26 putts and it was good. 

 Q. Have you been working on it? 
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Been working a lot on my stroke, at home on the carpet. Because it hard when it's winter greens. And I came out a week early here so I've been doing a lot of drills.

 Q. At Emirates Golf Club?
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Yeah, at Emirates. They let us practise here early, so came out and practise and got the swing going.

 Q. So the ultimate goal, coming out here, what were you looking to do? 
 PAMELA FEGGANS: Top-10 would be great. Just kind of play it one hole at a time and see where that leaves me.
