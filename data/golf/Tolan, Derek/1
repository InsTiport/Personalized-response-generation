DEREK TOLAN:  There's a couple of things that I need to get used to, but overall, I didn't think it affected the way I played, I just didn't play very good.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DEREK TOLAN:  I really didn't think about that all day.  I really didn't -- I thought about it when I saw the pairs a while ago, but it didn't -- I didn't think about it during the play. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DEREK TOLAN:  I didn't think I was going to be all that nervous, but you could just watch the tapes, I was walking funny.  I was so nervous, I forget how to breathe.  Yeah, I was real nervous.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DEREK TOLAN:  I think after I hit my tee shot on 3, the par 3, after that, I started settling down, getting in a little comfort zone.

Q.  Have you set a goal for yourself?
DEREK TOLAN:  It was just not to make any doubles, basically.  If you get into trouble, just get out the next shot.  That's all you can do.  And I made one out there, but I saved a couple of bogies.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DEREK TOLAN:  It did.  That helped out a lot.  I didn't think it foreshadowed anything in the round.  But it helped me a lot to relax.  You don't want to start off bad.

Q.  Were you surprised at the crowd's reaction?
DEREK TOLAN:  Yeah, I just enjoyed it a ton.  It helped me out a lot.  It made me concentrate a lot more, too.  Overall, the crowd support was awesome, and it helped me out a ton.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DEREK TOLAN:  Actually starting to get kind of close where we live.  Yeah, it's right in the neighboring cities.  It actually came into our county.  All my family is here right now, lucky for that.  But it is sort of concerning now, but not much I can do from here.
