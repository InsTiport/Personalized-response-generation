STEVEN TILEY:  I'll take a lot from this week.  I'm
playing well.  I'm playing nicely.  I knew that coming into it.
I've had a good year so far.  And this is just pushing on really
from now.  It's good.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEVEN TILEY:  Not bad, yeah.  This is my fourth one now.
And I think this is my top finish by quite a bit.  I finished tied
for 68th at St. Andrews.  So hopefully maybe sneak into the top
25.  We'll see.  It's only getting harder out there.  It's not
getting any easier, that's for sure.  There's a couple of tough
pins coming in.  15 is a really tough pin.  If anyone gets close
there today, that's some shot there.  And 16 is tough, as well.
If you miss that just slightly right, you're pretty much dead
there.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEVEN TILEY:  In terms of financial?  Yeah.  Obviously
it's nice.  That's just the icing on the cake, as it were.  We
play a sport that we love.  And lucky enough to get paid for it at
the end of the week.
But it would be a nice reward and let's hope I can push
on.  And I just wish it counted towards the Tour, to be honest.
I'll be leapfrogging some people, if it did.  But unfortunately
I've got to go back next week and put my head down and get on with
