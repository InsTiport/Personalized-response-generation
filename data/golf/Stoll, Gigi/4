  GIGI STOLL: I just learned a lot playing with Brooke. She's a great player. She's, I think, tied for the lead or something. It was just fun to watch her. I think she's fully dedicated, and once I get to college, I'll be able to do the same. 

Q. Do you feel like it's going to turn out to be a good thing that you were paired with her?
GIGI STOLL: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Just to see a young player like that take over and play really well was really fun. 

Q. You played better today. What did you do a little bit better than you did yesterday?
GIGI STOLL: I hit the ball a little bit better today. That was pretty much the big thing. I hit a couple more fairways, a couple more greens, but it was still okay. It wasn't my best, but it was better.

Q. Were you okay, able to focus completely with all the other stuff‑‑
GIGI STOLL: Once I'm on the golf course, it's all about the golf, but it is in the back of my head, just pretty much all about the whole thing right now. But once I'm on the course, it's mainly golf.

Q. So now you've got more time to pack?
GIGI STOLL: I guess, more time to say goodbye to some people and pack up.
