Q.   Folks would like to know what are your thoughts on today's opening round.
EDWARD FIGUEROA:   I was playing really well in the beginning, and then I got a little frustrated on some short putts, and then just got I think too quick and started losing some drives out right and started losing it mentally and just had a stretch of three bogeys in a row and just couldn't really get it back mentally. 
I was playing well, just putted BAD, and I think just mentally I just lost it.

Q.   4‑over after 18, 18 more to go.   Nice putt to finish.   Probably give you a good feeling towards tomorrow.   You play in the morning.   You need a good round in order to keep going in this tournament.   What do you expect tomorrow?
EDWARD FIGUEROA:   I'm hoping to putt well and just try to kind of slow down my thoughts and keep everything slower.   And hopefully I'll shoot like a 3, 4‑under round and make the cut.   That would be great.
