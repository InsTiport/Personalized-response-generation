Q. Want to offer best case and worse case scenarios?
JOE HALVORSON: Sure.  Best case scenario tomorrow, the heaviest rainfalls, intensity that is, holds off until noon, 1:00.  Then as you get past 3:00 or so, then the rainfall rates could increase.  I think that's your best case scenario, that's lighter in the morning, we get done and then it breaks loose after that.
Q. Worse case scenario.
JOE HALVORSON: Worse case scenario, we come in to moderate to heavy rain right in the morning at 6:00 a.m., talking about tenth of an inch per hour and then with that rainfall rate increasing as we go into the late morning, early afternoon, maybe on the order of tenth to two-tenths of an inch by the noon hour.
Q. Are you worried there's going to be a lot of rain tonight, we heard that also?
JOE HALVORSON: Not as worried about the rainfall tonight.  I think overnight conservatively I'm seeing about a quarter inch but my gut thinks it's going to be less than a tenth.  Yes, much less than last night.  The impulse that affected us is to the east, southeast of us now so likely not going to get any activity from that.
Q. What about Monday?
JOE HALVORSON: Monday I do see a clear window potentially from 8 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  The slug of moisture that's going to be impacting us tomorrow, that drifts north of us after about 8:00 a.m.  We may see a window where it's just more scattered lighter showers before thunderstorms become possible in the afternoon.  Right now I'm thinking after 2:00 p.m. storms will become likely on Monday.
Q. What about Tuesday?
JOE HALVORSON: Yes.  So behind the front on Tuesday, I think we just get scattered rains and they would be on the lighter side.  So, likely, no instability as well.  Just rain.
Q. Wednesday looks good.
JOE HALVORSON: Wednesday looks pretty good.
