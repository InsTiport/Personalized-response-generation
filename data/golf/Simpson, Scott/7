 Q. U.S. Open Champions can play U.S. Open courses no matter where; right?
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Well, yeah. I played well today. This is a little different than a normal U.S. Open course.

 Q. I would agree. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: But, I mean, yeah, not a huge Pete Dye fan, but you have to play well. (No microphone.) I had a good day, and I played solid.

 Q. What did you do particularly well? Break down your game. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Just played real steady. Drove it good. Hit a lot of good irons. Got a lot of fairways. Then made some putts.
 You know, putting hasn't been my strong point so far, but I putted better last week and putted better today.

 Q. Has it been easier or harder to get your form back after the injury than you thought?
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Probably a little harder. Yeah I was hoping it would come back quicker. But, you know, the part about just a little thing to get off and playing under the gun when you haven't done it very much. Takes you awhile to get use to it. Amazing, like Greg Norman who plays so little and still plays well. 

 Q. That's why he is Norman. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Yeah.

 Q. And Watson doesn't play a lot, too. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Yeah.

 Q. And Jack. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: I know Jack can only play 18 a year and plays great. I don't know how they do it. I need to play more.

 Q. You and (No microphone.) Were both around 4- or 5-under. Were you pushing each other at all?
 SCOTT SIMPSON: You know, it doesn't matter really to me what my playing partners are doing. I mean, it's nice when they're playing well, too. It's fun.

 Q. How were the crowds out there?
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Great. Really great. This is the U.S. Senior Open, the top major of the year and the crowds are fantastic. Watson was just ahead of us. Of course, if I was buying a ticket, I'd watch Tom Watson too.

 Q. What do you mean? You beat him. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: That's right. I did beat him once. But he is still one of my favorite golfers.

 Q. He is fun to watch. 
 SCOTT SIMPSON: There's so many good players, and look at how the guys played. It really shows that boy there's a lot of the older guys that can still play well. With Watson almost winning and achieving (No microphone.) In Milwaukee five out of six 50-year-olds achieved the cut and played well. Loren is playing great.

 Q. Do you expect to see a little harder golf course tomorrow the way it's set up?
 SCOTT SIMPSON: I don't think so. No. I think, you know, there's chances out there if you are playing well you can make birdie. 
 The greens are pretty receptive. It's in great shape. If you are playing well you can make some birdies as long as you avoid some of the disasters. 
 It will be under par.
