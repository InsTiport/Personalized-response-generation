 Q.   41 putts on Tuesday, then 28 the last two days, what's been working well with you and the putter?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Thursday we had a scorer who didn't keep it right.   That wasn't right.   
   
 Q.   Oh, okay.   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   I don't even know what I had.   I probably had like 30 putts or something.   But, no, I'm rolling the ball well, I'm hitting it okay, and I'm chipping good.   Chipping and putting well.  
   
 Q.   Did the greens have a very different feel from coming off of this round?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   They were a little softer today with the rain.   But they're still tough to putt.  
   
 Q.   Can you compare them to any other greens that you played in recent years?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Well, we played a course in Korea that Nicklaus did that was real similar to this.   As far as other greens, you know, Prairie Dunes, one of my favorite courses, has a little bit of this in the greens.   These are a little severe maybe, but I can't think of too many courses with greens like this.
