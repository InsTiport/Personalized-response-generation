 Q.   So what are your thoughts on your round today?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   I played well.   Yeah.   It's a good ‑‑ I mean it's a tough course.   You got to keep it in play off the tee and hit a lot of good iron shots.   I could have maybe putted better, but that's okay.   But, yeah, it was good.  
   
 Q.   How is the course playing?   How are the conditions out there?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Great.   Yeah, it's in great shape.   The course is ‑‑ the greens are just really tough.   They like to make it hard on us.   
   
 Q.   So what are you thinking you need to do tomorrow to put yourself with a good chance to win here on Sunday?  
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Play pretty much the same, maybe make a few more putts and just keep playing the same.   
A couple shots here and there to work on and, yeah, just keep ‑‑ if I can shoot in the 60s again I would be pretty happy.
