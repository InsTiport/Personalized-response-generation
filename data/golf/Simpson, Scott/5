  Q. Birdie, birdie on 15 and 16. Can you just describe those two holes?  
 SCOTT SIMPSON: I hit good drives both times. And 15 just hit it to the left with my iron shot and then made a really good putt actually, about a 30-footer.   
 Then 16, hit a driver, 2-iron to the front edge and made a long 2-putt, but I 2-putted.   
  
  Q. Overall your round as a whole, how do you feel?  
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Overall pretty good. Under par in the afternoon is a good score. I had three 3-putts, so I'm not happy about that, but I made some good putts too.   
 So I mean 1-under is a good score, I would have taken that in the afternoon, for sure.  
  
  Q. Do you feel just the wind and the altitude, having to make adjustments with the ball, how are you able to do that?  
 SCOTT SIMPSON: The wind is biggest problem. And the altitude isn't that bad. You get used to that. But the wind's tough. It makes it a guessing game sometimes.   
  
  Q. Do you feel good heading into round two?  
 SCOTT SIMPSON: Yeah. Yeah. I feel good. You never know, it's golf, but overall pretty good.
