 Q.   I'm here with Scott Simpson.   Can you talk about the shots that Tom Kite was hitting on the front?   If you weren't aware, it's the lowest nine holes we've had in a USGA Open Championship of all time.   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Well, I can't imagine too many 27s.   It would be pretty low, wouldn't it?  
   
 Q.   It was 28.   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   He shot 28?  
   
 Q.   Yes.   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   To beat that would be pretty low.   Well, actually, he parred 1, but then he just hit a lot of good shots.   He holed one out of the rough.   That was probably a little bit lucky.   But other than that, he just hit a lot of good shots, drove it good, hit good shots, and he made every putt.  
   
 Q.   I mean, you've seen the course now that you've played 18 holes.   Did you see a 28 out there on the front nine?   Obviously, you did just see a 28.   Before the championship, would you have expected that?   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   No.   I mean, the greens are holding better early.   So they were holding pretty well.   So if you were driving it really well, which he was, you could fire at the pins, which he did.   Of course, he putted really good.   
Obviously, you have to do everything good to shoot 28.  
   
 Q.   Do you expect it to be a little firmer for these guys in afternoon?   
SCOTT SIMPSON:   Yeah, I think it will get firmer in the afternoon.   It was already getting firmer on our back nine.   So it will firm up.   It will probably be about the same tomorrow.   A little bit soft early but then firm up as the day goes on.   
But it's just one of those nights.   He just played great.  
   
 Q.   He absolutely did.   Thank you very much.
