 Q.  Can you just tell me about your overall emotion about this week.  
AMY ALCOTT: Well, it was very emotional seeing the USGA sign, because I've had such a long history, since my teens, playing in USGA championships.   
I thought the week just came off beautifully.  The USGA did a great job.  It was just so classy how everything was done, this inaugural event and how was it presented.   
I wish I would've played a little bit better, but did I hit 18, which is a par-5, I hit it four days in a row in two, so I have a few good things to take from that.  I think you got two superstars that are still actively playing quite a bit, still right there, so it should be a great finish.   
I think the Chicagoland area loved it.  I'm sure that we'll have a great event at Pine Needles.   
 Q.  I was about to ask you.  Joanne said she's going to be playing out there when she's 80 next year.  Have you thought that far ahead?  
AMY ALCOTT: I'm sure she is.  I'm going to play forever.  As long as I can walk, I'll be in this tournament.
