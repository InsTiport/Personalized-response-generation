 Q.  Tell us about your round today. 
 GARY ROBISON:  Feel real good, except for the last couple holes.  I bogeyed the second hole, I kind of missed my yardage and I had it right up against the hazard, so I made bogey there.  But I played real good all wait around. 
 17, I missed about a three foot putt there. 
 And drove it in the bunker and made bogey on the last hole.  But besides that it was real good.  I'm pleased with it. 

 Q.  You're one of nine PGA club professionals who made the cut here.  Do you feel like that is, do you feel any responsibility to represent the association or when you come out here is this golf, the nature of it, is it an individual thing or do you look around and see how the others are doing? 
 GARY ROBISON:  I know most of the club pros, so I'm rooting for all those guys too.  But when you get out there you're on your own and I'm just trying to do the best I can and just play one shot at a time, one hole at a time and I really don't worry about anybody or anything else that's going on, just trying to get in your own little deal and see if we can make some birdies. 

 Q.  As far as your expectations for the weekend, and with today's round, how do you feel about tomorrow?  Does that set you up where you want to be? 
 GARY ROBISON:  Well, obviously, I'm not very close to the leaders, but I played all right today.  I was a little disappointed to finish that way, like it is all the time.  But there's just a lot of traps out there and holes that you can fall in and that.  So it's tough to go around there at not stumble somewhere along the line.  So but I feel good about it.
