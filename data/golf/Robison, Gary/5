 Q. Just an opening comment about how you feel you played today. 
 GARY ROBISON: I started out pretty good and I got ahead of the ball game a little bit. I shot 1-under on the back. Which was my front side. 
 I still only made one birdie, which is just, it's hard to hit it close, but I mean, the back side, I just didn't hit very many good irons. I hit it in the rough on the second hole and made bogey. And then just missed the green on 3 and made bogey. 
 My last few holes coming in I missed the green with a 7-iron and 3-putted or had it on the edge on 7 there and 3-putted. So I gave a couple back coming in. 
 But overall it was good. It's just hard. If you don't put it in the fairway you can't play. 

 Q. How do you feel today versus yesterday?
 GARY ROBISON: I don't know. I think I played about the same, really. Short game's been pretty good so far and which you got to have around here. You can't finish if you don't. 
 But I don't know. It's, you put it in the fairway you have a chance and if you don't, you don't. 

 Q. How would it feel to make the cut today at this event?
 GARY ROBISON: It feels good. Yeah, I think it's the fourth time I have. Yeah. So at least I think I'm all right. I didn't look to see where we're at, but it feels good. And being up north and playing on this kind of grass may be a little advantage to the guys up north. But it feels good. I'm looking forward to the next couple days, especially when it warms up.
