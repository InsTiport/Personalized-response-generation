Q.  How did practice go for you today?
GARY ROBISON:  Fine.  The wind was a little bit different today than it has been.  But it was a little less wind, so it makes it a little more playable.
Q.  Okay.  Feeling confident about the tournament tomorrow?
GARY ROBISON:  I don't know.  Until the flag comes up I'm not real sure.

It's a real hard golf course and I guess if you drive it fairly well, you can maybe hopefully play halfway decent.  But if you don't, it's going to be a long round.
