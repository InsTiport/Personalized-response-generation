 Q. How did the course and the conditions affect your play today?
 GARY ROBISON: I'm not sure. I just didn't putt it very good today. I didn't play too bad, I just -- it played about the same. 
 As a matter of fact, I thought the greens were a little slower and I thought they were harder, firmness-wise so I don't know. I just didn't putt very good and so that's how I ended up.

 Q. What are you expecting to do tomorrow?
 GARY ROBISON: Well, just do the best we can. Try to put it in the fairway and which I did most of the time today, really, and I just didn't hit very many good irons and then I didn't putt it very well and didn't chip it very well. So I just wasn't very good. But that's why I shoot what I shoot.
