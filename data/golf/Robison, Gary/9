Q.  How was the tournament out there today?
GARY ROBISON:  Good.  It was hot.  It played pretty much like it had in the practice round, I guess.  The wind was pretty much the same.
Q.  Were there any standout shots?
GARY ROBISON:  Yeah, I hit quite a few good shots.  It's just I just had one bad hole.  I made 8 on the third hole.  The par 5 I hit it out of bounds and besides that, I played pretty good.  So I'm pleased with everything but one shot.
Q.  What are your expectations for the rest of the week?
GARY ROBISON:  Just try to play as good as we can tomorrow and hopefully make a cut and start moving up.
