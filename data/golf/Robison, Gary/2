 Q. You parred 16. Now that's a tough hole. 
 GARY ROBISON: Yeah. Yeah. Good par-5.

 Q. How did you handle that?
 GARY ROBISON: I hit a good drive and good 3-wood and had about 65 to the hole and hit it about 15 foot and made that.

 Q. You're a northeast Ohio guy, have you played the course a number of times before?
 GARY ROBISON: A few, not a lot. But probably a half a dozen times before this. 

 Q. How did the greens play today?
 GARY ROBISON: They were fine. The golf course is absolutely perfect, so if you hit it where you're looking, you got a chance. 

 Q. The fourth was a challenge today. 
 GARY ROBISON: Yeah, it was. I just, you know, I didn't hit a good drive and I hit a bad chip and hit it in the bunker and didn't get it up-and-down from the bunker and just a bad hole. 

 Q. What was the best club in your bag today?
 GARY ROBISON: I'm not sure any of them were real good. I don't know, I hit a lot of good shots, I just never made any birdies. And it's hard to when you're not making any birdies, you can't score. So just a lot of 2-putts, so.
