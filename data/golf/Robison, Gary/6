  Q. Give me a quick rundown of how it went today.   
 GARY ROBISON: It was difficult. I don't know, I hit a lot of good putts. Obviously got up-and-down quite a few times. I didn't make any birdies, I just made five bogeys and that was it.   
 But I felt pretty good about it. It's hard as it is, as difficult as it is, I haven't even seen the scores, so I don't even know what the scores are, but you definitely have to just take your medicine if you hit in the rough and then just try to make par.   
 It's a good half shot penalty if you hit it in the rough. But I don't know, hopefully the wind dies down a little bit tomorrow and it will be a little easier. It swirls around here a lot and that makes it really difficult.  
  
  Q. How does that affect your round? The swirling winds?  
 GARY ROBISON: I think it affects it a lot. It just seems like you're crosswind and then when you hit it then you say it's downwind and then it's just swirling from hole to hole and it's just hard to be real confident on your shots when you're doing that.   
  
  Q. What do you have to do tomorrow?  
 GARY ROBISON: Oh, I'm just going to go out and play. That's it.
