 Q. You started playing a little bit better today and than you did yesterday, did you change your strategy or anything?
 GARY ROBISON: No, I played as good yesterday as I did today. I just didn't make any putts at all yesterday. And today I made a couple, so. 

 Q. How are you feeling about the cut?
 GARY ROBISON: Probably a little short. 

 Q. Okay. Is that all?
 GARY ROBISON: That's about it. 

 Q. Okay. What were your overall feelings about the course? Did you like the course?
 GARY ROBISON: Yeah, it's good. You can make some birdies, but you got to hit good shots or you can make a bogey or double bogey pretty quick.
