 Q.  Tell us about the conditions out there? 
 GARY ROBISON:  They were a little bit milder than yesterday.  But it's still blowing pretty good.  You have to hit a lot of different shots.  And pretty much play defense is what I've been playing.  Obviously I only made one birdie in 36 holes.  So, but it's a matter of where you miss it and hopefully you make some putts.  But it's pretty tough.  Tough to hit it close, tough it to make birdies. 

 Q.  Do you feel that today you used some of the things you learned from yesterday? 
 GARY ROBISON:  I think the more you play it, you know, I'm not saying you're going to ever get comfortable with this place, but you get a little better feel for it and just really it's kind of where you don't want to go as much as where you're trying to go. 

 Q.  It's a very difficult golf course, but how much can you actually enjoy the experience being out there playing? 
 GARY ROBISON:  Well, it's a great experience regardless.  But it's a different game.  It's, you know, it's not your typical throw it in there high and let her sit down.  You're playing a lot of different shots and unless you keep the ball down a little bit it's really hard to judge your distances.  So I think that the guys that keep it down, they got a better chance.
