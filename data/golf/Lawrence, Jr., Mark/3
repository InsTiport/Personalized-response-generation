Q. First of all, that was a crazy roller coaster match.  How did you survive your emotions in that one?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: Yeah, I mean, I kind of got off to an early lead, but he started playing really well in the middle; he made four or five birdies.
I just had to try to stick with it.  Then just kind of went my way the last couple holes.  Hit a good shot in there on 18, which helps a lot.
Q. What did you hit there?  What was your yardage there on 18?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: 170; I hit a 9-iron.
Q. How did you collect yourself to come back?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: I have a great caddie, and just I've been playing well so I believed that I could get it back.
Q. How do you know your caddie?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: We've played golf together since I was probably eight or nine years old.
Q. Did he play college golf?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: He did.  He played for JMU.
Q. James Madison?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: Yes.
Q. What's his name?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: Chris Kapsak.
Q. What were you doing well at the beginning?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: I mean, I made a long putt on 2 from just off the green.  I won a few holes with pars just getting the ball in the right spots.
I just didn't make many mistakes in the beginning.  I did make some mistakes after that, which I got...  (Wind interference.)
Q. (Wind interference.)
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: Yeah, a little bit.  But I knew that there were still three holes left, so if I could just get a couple good swings in I could get it back to even and maybe win.
Q. Had you ever been up in a match that big and lost it?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: I probably been 3-up before and lost a match.  I don't know.  I honestly try to forget about stuff like that.
Q. How did you win 17 with the par?  Was it pretty much straightforward hole for you?
MARK LAWRENCE JR.: Yeah, I mean, I hit a good drive and went for the green in two and I clipped the branch in the tree and ended up just short.
I was actually in a really good shot and then just didn't hit a great pitch shot and 2-putted for par.
He was in about the same spot from me because he laid up and it was in a bunker and then hit it to - his third shot - to where I was after two.  He hit it to about six feet and missed it.
