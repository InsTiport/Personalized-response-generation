Q. Just walk me through your reaction to the first 18 holes.
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: This first 18 holes were really tough.  We both played really good golf.  I'm really excited.  I mean, we got to the finals, so I was expecting a low score, and we made some birdies.  The second 18s were really good, I think, for both of us.
It's going to be a good match.  I mean, we're having a lot of fun on the course.  It's a fair match, and it's -- we are showing a lot of sportsmanship on the course, and this is what you really want to have on a final.
Q. Are you talking to each other?  What's the atmosphere like between the both of you?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, we are talking.  We are actually trying to translate words from English to Italian or Korean and like trying to give us advice on the words so I know how to say hi in Korean.  It's like annyeong, something like that.  Annyeong is like hi.
Q. What do you change, if anything, heading into the second 18?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: You know, I'm not going to change anything.  I'm just going to keep doing my game.  I know she's a great player, and it's fun -- it's fun to play a final like this.  We'll see how that goes.
Q. What do you need to do to take her down?  Knowing her game, what do you need to do?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Make some more putts.  I haven't made a lot of putts.  On the front nine I had a lot of good chances.  On the par-5, 7, I had a good chance.  I was pretty close.  And again in the second nine, on the 13th I was pretty close again, and I just couldn't make those.  And 17 again.  So I just need to roll some putts in.  I think that would be the key.
