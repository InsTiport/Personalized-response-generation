 Q.  Virginia, a great match, a great week, as well.  I just wanted to ask, when did you start feeling a little bit dizzy throughout the match?  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: I think on the second nine around 11 or something like that.  I was not feeling that good, and it kept kind of going -- my coach was telling me to call medicals, and I was like, no, I can do it, I can do it, but then I couldn't do it anymore.   
 Q.  It seemed like you got a little bit of energy there about 16.  Did it kind of come back to you a little bit?  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, a little bit, and I was feeling a little bit better.  Still like going down and trying to mark the ball was hard, but it's all right.   
 Q.  And you were part of such an exciting match.  Talk about the putt on 17.  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, I don't know.  I decided, okay, either I make it or it's over, so I gave like my best to make that putt, and it went in.  I think it's the only putt that I made today, but it's okay.  It was a tough match.   
You know, when you're not able to play your best because you're not feeling great, it's okay.
