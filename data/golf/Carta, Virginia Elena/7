Q. Nice playing out there.  You're the first player we've had a chance to speak with.  Tell us about your day and tell us about the golf course.
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: The golf course is so tough.  I think it's one of the toughest golf courses that I've ever played, but I'm really excited for today.  I played really well this morning.  The morning match was so hard, and my opponent was really good.  This afternoon was the same.  I made some more putts, a few more putts, and I kept my game going, and I'm really excited.  I saw a lot of sportsmanship, and that's always nice to see, people that are like really good players but also that are sportsmen, and that's amazing.
Q. What makes this golf course so difficult in your opinion?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: I think just the length of the golf course.  I think it's pretty long to be a golf course, and the par-3s play really long.  I had to hit like 3-wood, and I usually don't hit 3-wood on par-3s.  So that's part of it, and then the greens.  The greens are really, really fast and really hilly and slopy.  So that's hard.  But I know that like a physical therapist yesterday told me that that's the name of the golf course, Rolling Greens, so it makes sense.
Q. It's appropriate, right?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah.
Q. It's been a long day for you so far.  What does tonight hold?  Are you going to rest, practice?  What do you do now?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: No practice.  I'm going to rest and get ready for tomorrow, probably dinner at an Italian place that's really good.
Q. Do you know where you're going?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yes.
Q. Where is it?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: It's close to our hotel, and it's called Il Granio or something like that.  It's an Italian place, really good.
Q. Coming from you, it must be very good.
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Exactly.
