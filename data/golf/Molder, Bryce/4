 Q.  14 birdies in two days.  How is all that coming together for you, and especially today where you were rolling it very well, 7 birdies on this round?  
BRYCE MOLDER: Yeah.  It was a lot with the putter.  I didn't hit a lot of great shots.  My good shots ended up good which does not always happen, but it happened this time and I made them.   
So, I got a little bit of work on the range before.  I felt great heading into the weekend.  When I'm putting that well, you know, I should be all right.   
 Q.  Couple of specific putts that kept it going for you today?  
BRYCE MOLDER: You know what, it was -- I really only missed one short one.  I missed one short one yesterday.  Other than that, it was just one on top of another.   
So, I can't remember -- I can't think back to exactly which one may have gotten everything going but really the 2nd Round I started -- I figured out a little something swing-wise, I started feeling more comfortable, started hitting a lot more fairways and greens and having some good looks.  I've been saying I've been looking forward to bent grass greens for months now and we finally get to them and the hole looks big.   
 Q.  Tied for 22nd last year.  How are you feeling about the weekend now?  
BRYCE MOLDER: I feel good.  Yeah, I feel really good.  It's going to be -- with these conditions, it's probably going to be a little bunched.  Going to be some good scores I'm sure this afternoon. Still going to have to -- I don't think the winds are going to pick up dramatically over the weekend.  I have to make some birdies, but I like how I stand.
