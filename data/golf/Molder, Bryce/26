   BRYCE MOLDER: It was great for about 16 and a half, 17 holes. No, it was good. I played solidly. I got to watch a lot of tennis today. Took a nap. It was a strange day, but that's part of it. 

 Q. Seems like it's been the thing. BO talked about taking a nap. A lot of guys taking naps today. 
 BRYCE MOLDER: You know, it's funny. You've got guys in locker rooms, laid back. You're tripping over guys. 
 I was over in the caddie tent. That's where they had the tennis on. Everybody was over there. I was watching that and fell asleep for a while and somebody else was on the couch, you know, asleep next to me. 
 You know, it's just kind of -- you know, I'm still trying to get used to this time zone after coming from Phoenix, so it was an early wake up call. So I was looking for an afternoon nap anyway.

 Q. How about these long delays? Is it bad, tough, easy?
 BRYCE MOLDER: I think for the golf part once you're out there, you're out there. You know, we're kind of used to starting and stopping a little bit.
 It's just annoying, and you know, it's not fun for anyone. It's not fun for you guys. It's not fun for us. It's not fun for the volunteers. It's too bad, but we play outside. There's not much we can do about it.

 Q. Beautiful. Thanks.
