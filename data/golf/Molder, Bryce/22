  Q. 65?   
 BRYCE MOLDER: It was. I would say opportunistic. It's been that way all week. I'll play just okay, and then all of a sudden I'll hit it just inside of ten feet a couple of times and make it. It's a fun way to play. It's good. I don't know what's coming in, but certainly nothing to complain about.  
  
  Q. 25 putts in your third round?  
 BRYCE MOLDER: Yeah, I had -- gosh, I had five chips that I -- a couple of them were easy and a couple of them weren't. I chipped up all of them within about three feet. I was scrambling a little bit, but the putts were pretty short for par. I'll tighten that up a little bit for tomorrow, but maybe we can make less putts tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Frustrating that you weren't able to pick up birdies at 17 or 18 or is that just part of the flow of the round?   
 BRYCE MOLDER: It is. It's part of the flow. I didn't hit a great tee shot on 17, missed it in the right spot.   
 And then on 18, I didn't -- actually hit two really good shots. I had a full sand wedge and it spun a lot more than I thought it would and I almost made that.   
 I birdied 14 going up the hill with a 3-iron and made a 20-footer on 15. So sometimes that's just the way it goes.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts going into the final round?   
 BRYCE MOLDER: I'd just like to be as free as I can and go play. If I play well, great, I'll have a chance to do something special. If not, it's still a nice day.
