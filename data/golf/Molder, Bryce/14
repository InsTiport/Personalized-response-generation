 Q.   This is your ninth event of the year.   You've finished in the top 30 in eight events this year.   Can you just talk a little bit about that?   
BRYCE MOLDER:   Yeah, it's been steady for the year, nothing fantastic.   Steady is always good; that means you're close.   When you're finishing 30th, you're one shot from the Top 10 and two shots a day from winning.   So it's not far off, so it's a good start to the year.   I'm excited.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little bit about your round today and what went on out there?   
BRYCE MOLDER:   Yeah, it was funny.   I scored extremely well.   I could certainly hit the ball better and do some better things.   But I don't know that I could score any better.   Days like this on a course like this, scoring is the most important part.   So for me, it starts with the putter, and if I make a few putts, it seems like the fairways get bigger and the greens get bigger, and my chips are getting closer.   So you know, I made some putts on the front nine that kind of got me at least feeling like I was capable of doing some stuff.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, you're going to play tomorrow morning.   How do you carry momentum from this round into tomorrow morning?   
BRYCE MOLDER:   Every round is a different round, but when you've already seen some putts go in, it's nice.   When you've already seen some good tee shots, especially into the wind, it's nice to at least have something that is working.   Whether can you duplicate it again, who knows.   But it's certainly easier to feed off a good round, especially when you go in the afternoon and then turn around and play in the morning.
