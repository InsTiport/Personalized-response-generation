  Q. Obviously a tough way to finish, but, you know, being in contention, I guess you can call it a learning experience again and, I mean, just looked like you had everything going?  
 BRYCE MOLDER: Yeah. My goal was very clear for the day, that was to focus on me and the process and just try to commit and hit some shots. As far as that goes, I succeeded a hundred percent.   
 I'm certainly disappointed right now, and it may take a couple hours, but eventually I'll kind of look at it for what it is, and I gave myself a chance to play really well today.   
 The truth was I had some birdie putts early on. I think if just one or two of those falls early, I think it's a completely different day. I know my putter gets streaky hot, but I need to see a couple go in, and then the back-9 just got a little windy, kind tough to come back.
