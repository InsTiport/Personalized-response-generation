   BRYCE MOLDER: I hit a lot of greens. I probably made three or four putts over 20 feet, which you're going to have a lot of those putts. That's what you've got to do out here because you're not going to get it close a lot. 

 Q. Talk about that putt from 54 feet. Did you know as soon as you hit it that it was on line?
 BRYCE MOLDER: Well, it's one of those if I get it four feet past the hole it might go off the edge of the world. From what I saw it had some speed, and I thought, if the hole gets in the way. But I knew it was pretty good, and then from six, eight, ten feet out it looked pretty good. 
 It's one of those where I drove it right in the middle of a divot on that shot, and I was scared to tug it left, so I left it out to the right, and whatever, that's the way the world works.

 Q. Kind of funny how that works out. You put it in a divot off the tee and I'm sure you're saying some stuff under your breath, and now you go, I love the 7th hole. 
 BRYCE MOLDER: Yeah, exactly, I love that break. It's better than hitting it right down the middle, getting a good lie, hitting it ten feet and missing it.

 Q. Tell me about the rest of the golf course. Has it really gotten a lot firmer compared to round one?
 BRYCE MOLDER: You know, I think it's -- since we played in the afternoon yesterday and then the morning today, I would say it's probably right on track for how it was, just like it's -- it was almost the exact same yesterday afternoon as it was on Wednesday afternoon for the pro-am, so I think they've got it down to where they probably put a little bit of water on it overnight and they know exactly how much stress it's going to get, and with this dry air it's going to dry out, but it's playing perfect.
