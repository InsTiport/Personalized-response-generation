  BRYCE MOLDER: It still stayed soft and it was going to stay soft because it was raining, so it played longer when it was a little sloppy, but you hit your shots and you can still make some birdies.  I was kind of grinding it out, and the rain lifted a little bit, and I made a good up-and-down on 11 and then got on a run of birdies and turned a decent couple days into a good couple days.Q. With the amount of rain on the greens, was it difficult to adjust your speed?BRYCE MOLDER: You know, not much.  There was one point in there where it looked like water was starting to collect in some low spots, and that's when we stopped.  But after that, you know, it's not bad.  Usually when the rain is -- usually when they're wet, they break a little less, they kind of hold their line a little bit more, and they don't run out quite as much.  But I would say that they were the perfect speed for making putts.
