  Q. How is the golf course playing today?  
 BRYCE MOLDER: It's playing really good, I think. It's playing fast, so it's not playing really, really long, but yet the greens are just firming up. You can get it close, but you have to know what you're doing.  
  
  Q. As you went through your round today, what really did you excel at out there?  
 BRYCE MOLDER: I've driven the ball well the last two days, and my irons are getting more and more sharp. I'm getting a lot of chances. I actually missed a few pretty easy ones and made a few that you don't expect to make, so it kind of balances out. But overall just hitting it in the right spots, and if I can just take care of the par-5s it'll be just great.  
  
  Q. You live out here in Scottsdale. Is that an advantage to you?  
 BRYCE MOLDER: You know, I'm sleeping in my own bed, which is really nice. I think we get used to playing so many different golf courses, I think the weather and the grass and everything, that I don't think there's much of an advantage as far as that goes. But living here and getting to sleep in my own bed, that's awfully nice.
