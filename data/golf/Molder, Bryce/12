 Q.   Second day without any bogeys.   Just some comments.   
BRYCE MOLDER:   Yeah, no, hit a lot of fairways, quite a few greens.   The few times I missed or make par, I've done it.   
Really, if you keep the ball in front of you out here, you can get a lot of looks.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to today's round, other than that?  
BRYCE MOLDER:   Same as yesterday:   I hit a lot of fairways.   So I just got a lot of, you know, mid‑ to short‑irons where I could be aggressive.   
Same thing, par 5s, a couple of them are not long with the thin air.   Really just kind of keeping it to where I can be aggressive almost all day has really been the key.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts for the weekend?   
BRYCE MOLDER:   If I can do the same thing, make a few putts here and there, have some fun.
