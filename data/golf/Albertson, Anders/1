(In progress.)   
ANDERS ALBERTSON: Thanks.  Yeah, seemed to get better as the week went on.  Yeah, it was a really good I guess last two days.  I think we were at 5 yesterday and 6 today; a lot of birdies.   
No, it was really cool.  I knew we were close on the last couple.  We had a chance on 17 for pretty good birdie.  Just slid by.  Hit a little wayward tee shot on 18; made it difficult.   
No, it was a lot of fun today.  Really excited for the next couple coming up.   
 Q.  On the Web you were a birdie machine.  Scoring average was like 68.15.  That's pretty impressive.  What's the difference?  The birdies out there on the PGA?  
ANDERS ALBERTSON: You know, there are a lot of guys who are a little bit older than me who have really given me some good advice and given me some encouragement that if you can play well out there you can play well out here.  I think the results show from last couple years with so many winners coming from the Web graduate class.   
So, yeah, I think Web prepared me as best as it possibly could.  I'm thankful that I have three more events left in the year.   
 Q.  You got some valuable FedExCup points with this finish today.  Going to play the rest of the fall?  
ANDERS ALBERTSON: Yeah, you know, I don't know the breakdown of points, but obviously a good finish here really puts you ahead of the game for the FedExCup.  Eastlake is the goal this year.  It was our -- my home course and (indiscernible) home course for school, so it will be great to go back.   
Yeah, I don't know what we'll finish, but it should be top 10.  Give us a good boost for the rest of the year.
