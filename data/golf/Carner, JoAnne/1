JOANNE CARNER: You figure out something, and then it's always back and you're ready to go.  But I just get too stiff out there.  The extra hour and a half practice doesn't add to keeping me limber for the next day.
Q. How is it getting around this golf course compared to Chicago Golf Club last year?
JOANNE CARNER: That was easy.  This one is hillier, and I have a little COPD, so I wheeze a little going up these hills.  You know, just takes a little something out of you.
Q. When do you think you'll want to figure out whether you want to come back?  Is that a decision for down the road?
JOANNE CARNER: Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's always so much fun to play.  And you know, I don't have the putting yips, even though I missed some today.  You know, as long as you don't have the yips, you don't have to worry about playing, you know.
