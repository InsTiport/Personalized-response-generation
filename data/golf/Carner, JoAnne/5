Q. There's obviously been a lot of anticipation to today.  How did your day play out with all the expectations everywhere?
JOANNE CARNER: Well, you know, I hit some good shots, but I hit some awful shots, really.  You know, I had some 6- and 7-irons into the greens and just really hit awful shots.  One went in the water.  I made double, and that's a birdie hole.  I was fighting it all the way.
Q. Well, you've been saying your goal is to shoot your age, so how does it feel to accomplish that?
JOANNE CARNER: Yeah, that was good to get 1-under.  But anyway...
Q. And can you walk me through your emotions of hitting the first ball and all of that this morning?
JOANNE CARNER: Well, I wasn't as nervous as I thought I would be.  I think over here listening to the great National Anthem sort of inspired everybody, so I got up and hit a good one.
Q. What are your plans for the rest of the day?  Are you going to try and catch some of the action?
JOANNE CARNER: That's the funniest.
