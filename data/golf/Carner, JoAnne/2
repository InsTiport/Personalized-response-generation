 Q.  Tough day.  The greens are supposedly really rocket fast.  
JOANNE CARNER: Well, I mean, the greens are fast in it certain spots, but you have to hit your iron to a set area.  If you miss it just a little, it goes -- it almost goes in the hole and then keeps going and down and off the green.  Makes for a very difficult recovery shot, so...   
 Q.  How did you play?  
JOANNE CARNER: Like a dog.  (Laughter.)  I had a triple and a couple doubles on that backside.  Yeah, just chewed me right up.   
 Q.  Did you kind of feel ready to play today or just...  
JOANNE CARNER: No.  I been very stiff and can't really attack the ball like I want.  Hit some terrible shots really.  Every so often play okay, and then all of a sudden out of blue hit a terrible shot.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're like the ambassador of this championship in certain ways?  
JOANNE CARNER: Well, I don't know about that.  I know a lot of players.  I've played so many years out here that it's fun to see them, and then to see some of the young ones coming up.   
The nice thing about this is they invite a lot of the amateurs, so I get to see some of the 50-year-old amateurs from U.S. Amateur to Mid-Am and all the tournaments that the USGA runs.   
 Q.  How was the group of people following you today?  Pretty good group?  What did you think about it?  
JOANNE CARNER: Oh, it was kind of fun, and then when I finally did knock in a birdie putt I got a nice big roar.  That was refreshing.
