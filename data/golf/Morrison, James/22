Q.   Give us your thoughts on the day, obviously disappointing?
JAMES MORRISON:   Very disappointing, yeah.   Very disappointing.   But felt like I played really well under the situation.   Played great.   It's a matter of getting used to playing in these conditions. 
At the end of the day, playing so tough out there today.   I mean, the wind, firmness, everything.   It was brutal.   But at the same time, it's a learning curve and got to go on from there really.
Felt great.   Hit a couple of bad shots, but that wind is so tough out there, it makes it worse. 

Q.   You must be proud the way you battled back.   It was a good back nine. 
JAMES MORRISON:   Yeah, to shoot level par, I was happy with myself, happy that I stuck to it.
