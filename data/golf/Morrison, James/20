  JAMES MORRISON:   If you drove it good on the fairway you could really‑‑ I'm not surprised there's 5‑, 6‑unders out there.   If you drove it straight and the greens are perfect, you could really attack the golf course.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JAMES MORRISON:   Just hit 3‑wood, aimed down the right, tried to hit a little draw and just hit a little block.   And it was going down the right.   I got a little unlucky.   If my ball was a foot left I could hack it down and make 5 at the worst case.   I was under the bush, a tiny tree, and I had to take a drop up from the rough.   And then I made a double.   Obviously that was a little frustrating.   But pleased with how I battled back after that.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JAMES MORRISON:   Not really.   It was just, you know, I just go to the range and just try and tighten up a little bit.   As I said, it's not like I'm missing greens with a bad shot.   The one on 18 is probably one of the worst iron shots I hit all day.   Instead of hitting them on line, I'm hitting them five to ten yards off line, so I've got 20, 30 feet on holes when I'm standing in the fairway with an 8‑iron hoping to have 10 feet.   It was one of those rounds.   
But no, didn't hit it bad, it was just not spot on.   I'm not worried about that.   I'm sure a little bit on the range will tighten it up.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JAMES MORRISON:   Yeah, there's not many people in there right now, but it was still a nice cheer and we were saying that it would be nice to have that coming down the stretch on Sunday, having a large cheer.   Hopefully I get a chance to do something like that.
