Q. What do you reckon, 4-under to start?
JAMES MORRISON: Very happy.  Wind is blowing now but it was cold this morning and I played really well.
Q. Is this one of those tournaments you're determined to do well at?
JAMES MORRISON: I guess so, yeah, because I put a really average performance last year at Woburn.  Nice to be playing at home in front of semi-home crowds and always nice to play well in the UK.  A great week would be good.
Q. Not just around the corner for you but it's not that far from our own home?
JAMES MORRISON: Yeah, in my own bed this week, which is nice.  It's 35 minutes so it's not too, too far away.  Great to play in front of the English fans.  Hope to do more of it.
Q. Sounds like you're not entirely at your best health-wise?
JAMES MORRISON: No, had a bit of a cold last week, but raging toothache this week, dentist Wednesday.  But that's life, that's the game, you've got to deal with it and it is what it is.
Q. I was going to use the phrase grit your teeth, but is it one of those where you have to get on with it?
JAMES MORRISON: (Laughing) it's one of those, where you get on with it, it's life as golf.  We're away for 32 weeks roughly and you're going to be ill at some point.  Have to man up and get on with it suppose.  Just get through it and hopefully the antibiotics kick in pretty soon.  But other than that, I'm healthy.
