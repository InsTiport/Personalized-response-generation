 Q.   67, bogey‑free, didn't get the victory but you must be incredibly proud of what you've achieved today.   
JAMES MORRISON:   Exactly.   After last week, it was pretty hard to take.   Came here and back to business and did that, and my game is improving every day.   I'm doing all the right things.   
Bernd played too perfect today.   He won the golf tournament today, simple as that.   He played fantastic.  
   
 Q.   Three behind with three to play, straight at the flag at 16; you were not just playing for second place in an Open.   
JAMES MORRISON:   Definitely.   We had a number to get to double figures, really, and it's not an easy shot but for me it's a nice‑hold up into the wind.   It was a perfect 7‑iron executed and rolled the putt in.   
Hit a great shot on 17, took a firm bounce.   The last, very happy.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts going into The Open in this sort of form?  
JAMES MORRISON:   Haven't thought about it but again, if I stick to my process and do what I'm doing, who knows.   Golf is a silly game.
