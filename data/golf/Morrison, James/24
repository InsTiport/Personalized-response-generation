  Q. How are you playing?  
 JAMES MORRISON: Yeah, good. It's a nice start. Been pretty windy. It's tough, the scoring is good and you know it's going to be good no matter how hard it blows. Out here, it's a good score.  
  
  Q. Of the three courses, is this possibly the one that's easiest to score?   
 JAMES MORRISON: If there's any bad weather anywhere else -- here there are more chances to make birdies. Playing Carnoustie tomorrow so hopefully doesn't blow too hard around there.   
 Played all right at the start and then got held on middle of the round and finished strongly. Holed a few putts at the end.
