 Q.  The first three rounds, you used through fairly easy, big leads in the matches.  Today you were level through 11 holes.  What were you thinking at that stage?  
JAMES MORRISON: Not a lot really because I was sitting in my bed last night thinking, how do I approach this morning.  I was kind of expecting myself to play badly, in a positive way, because obviously I've not missed a shot for three days, and you can't keep going in that vein.   
So I was expecting something a little bit tougher than it was the first three days and it kind of was that.  He's a great player, Alejandro.  He's a great putter, so you know you've got to be on your game all day.  We were all square, and then kind of went away from there.   
 Q.  Did you feel there was a crucial moment?  
JAMES MORRISON: There was a few crucial moments, yeah.  On the 6th, the par 5, I've hit it in the long stuff left.  He's hit it a good drive.  I've duffed it two feet into the rough.  He's hit it up a tree, chipped it out.  End up making five in the end at one point, too.  It was a real match play, key moment there, where if I had lost that, I would have been a couple down.   
Shot on 10, hit it pretty close, made birdie.   
11, hit it left, in a little hoof print of some sort in the trees and made a good four from 130 yards.  Those were the kind of key moments really.  And then I kind of started swinging really well and made some good birdies coming in.
