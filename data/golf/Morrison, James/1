Q. 67, how was it?
JAMES MORRISON: It was good.  Played very steady.  Had a few good par saves around the middle par of the round.  Hit in the hazard off 18 tee and made a good five in the end.  When I got out of play, I scrapped it well, and when I hit it close, I took advantage, so very happy.
Q. How is the course condition-wise?
JAMES MORRISON: It's hot, firming up.  Greens are firming up a little bit.  Still a bit soft.  The course is playing fair, a bit of wind and it's hot.  So the course is playing very fair.  You play well, you can shoot a good score.
Q. Not a single bogey, so you must be happy with that.
JAMES MORRISON: Yeah, steady golf.  When I got out of play, I got up-and-down and holed some good putts.  Yeah, very, very pleased.
