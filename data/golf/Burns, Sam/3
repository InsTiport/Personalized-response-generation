Q. I know the finish was definitely not what you wanted but early on you were really playing well. What was working so well for you out there early on?
SAM BURNS: I think the golf course is playing tough, especially with the wind starting to get up there. Really, we had a good game plan coming in, and I think we stuck to it all day. I mean, on 18 there, just, we were playing the right shot, it just kind of squirted out to the right. So, yeah, I think going forward we'll probably stick to the same game plan and just keep trying to get the ball in the fairway and on the right spots on the greens.
Q. More takeaway how you played, maybe the first like 15 holes compared to the last -- or first 16 holes compared to the last two?
SAM BURNS: Yeah, for sure. I hit a great shot on 17. That green's pretty much impossible to hit downwind from that back tee. So, yeah, I mean, I played great all day. Even on 18 I hit a really good shot in there after I dropped, so definitely take away all the positives.
Q. What can the players that are going to go off in the afternoon kind of maybe expect to see, especially with the wind expected to kick up?
SAM BURNS: Yeah, I mean the greens are firming up. Obviously with the sunshine and the wind on them they're just going to keep getting firmer. So I think anything under par this afternoon's a good score.
