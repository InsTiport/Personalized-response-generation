Q. Sam, 3-under par, 68 today.  Just get some comments on your round.
SAM BURNS:   Yeah, I think overall it was solid.  I think I didn't quite drive it well enough to give myself enough looks.
Other than that, I think overall it was solid.  Managed the golf course well.  Yeah, I think just drive it a little bit better, give myself some more opportunities tomorrow.
Q. Take us through the eagle on No. 3.
SAM BURNS:   Yeah, hit a good tee shot there kind of down the right side, and then pretty good hybrid in there.  Jut needed a couple more to carry the right edge, but got up on the front and I was able to make a long putt.
Q. Bit of a topsy-turvy back nine.  Comment on that if you can.
SAM BURNS:   Yeah.  Like I said, I just didn't drive it well enough.  Bunker on 10, desert on 11, made two bogeys.  Need to put it in the fairway.
Q. Just two shots back.  Talk a little bit about your excitement level going into the weekend in contention here.
SAM BURNS:   Yeah, I think we're in a good position.  Continue to play the golf course as we have planned out.  See what happens.
