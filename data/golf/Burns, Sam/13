 Q.  You worked your way back into the mix today; steady round?  
SAM BURNS: Yeah, it was pretty steady.  Obviously yesterday in the afternoon Riviera was pretty tough just kind of hanging in there shooting 2-over.   
I knew I had a chance today this morning.  Played pretty well today.  Excited for match play to start.   
 Q.  Is there a sense of relief right now because you know you're solidly in match play?  
SAM BURNS: I think definitely is a little bit.  Obviously coming into the week you know that the cut is top 64.  Once you get into match play kind of anything can happen.   
I think knowing that and knowing that you're in is a good feeling.   
 Q.  Does your mindset change now that you're playing against an opponent rather than the course?  
SAM BURNS: Yeah, I think it does for sure.  Obviously a little bit of a different mindset in match play depending on what your opponent does and stuff like that.   
For me it's just keep playing aggressive and just play my game.   
 Q.  Tell me about your rounded today, those three birdies.  First you birdied 5.  
SAM BURNS: Uh-huh.  Kind of got an unfortunate break on 1.  I was up against like -- I don't know even know what it was, like the lip of a rough cut.  Yeah, made a good birdie on 5.   
Hit good shot in there, on the par-3.   
 Q.  What did you hit into there?  
SAM BURNS: I think I hit 9-iron, and then I birdied the par-5.  Just pretty steady.  Just trying to give myself chances all day.  I knew that if I could shoot 2 or 3-under it would be just fine.   
 Q.  Was there any pars that you thought that's keeping the rounds going today?  
SAM BURNS: Yeah, made a good par on 16.  Hit just left of the green.  Left my putt a little short, about eight feet, and made it coming down the hill, so that was nice.
