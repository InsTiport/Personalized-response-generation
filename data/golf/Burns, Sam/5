 Q.  9 out of 14 fairways and you're 22 years old.  Talk about today's round and the morning round at Bethpage Black in general.  
SAM BURNS: Yeah, I think for starters, this golf course is very challenging.  Off the tee especially, if you get into some of that rough in certain areas, it's hard to advance it even to the green.  So yeah, I think I drove it pretty well besides a couple holes, but that's part of it.  And then from there, just trying to hit it in good spots on the green.  If you can just get yourself good looks, you kind of roll in a few putts, and that's what I did.  So overall a good start.   
 Q.  Talk a little about the Web.com.  I know how important it was to you and how you learned how to win out there and how you feel like that's going to bode well, especially for this year.  
SAM BURNS: Yeah, I think it prepared me really well.  There's a lot of really good players at that level on the Web.com, and so playing against those guys and just giving myself an opportunity to win in Savannah and getting it done I think gave me a lot of confidence knowing that I can win at the Web.com level, and hopefully we'll one day win on this level, as well.   
 Q.  You've got a lot of time left this afternoon.  I know rest and recovery plays a big part in majors.  What does your afternoon look like?  
SAM BURNS: Probably go get some lunch here in a minute.  Probably won't practice too much, maybe an hour, hour and a half, get a little workout in, and chill the rest of the day.
