Q. Sam, nice 68; right now looking like tied for third, and that's a career best.  You've got to be pretty satisfied right now?
SAM BURNS: Yeah, it was.  Kind of didn't really have anything early; struggling a little bit.
Started finding a little bit on the back nine there and made a few coming in, which is nice.
Q. Your impressions of this tournament?  People come out for it, it's a great golf course.  Do you feel like it suited your game this week?
SAM BURNS: Yeah, I love this place.  Ever since the PGA TOUR switched it here, you know, living two and a half, three and a half hours away I've come over here a decent bit and got to play this golf course.
They did an incredible job this week.  These are some of the best greens we play all year, and so to have this weather on the weekend was really nice.
