Q. How strong is 4-under par to get this tournament started for you today?
KEVIN KISNER: I played nicely, I probably didn't strike it as solidly as I have the last couple weeks but I got away with the misses.  And really didn't hole that many putts, I hit it close four or five times and then birdied the par-5s.  So it was a solid day overall.
Q. Give us an idea of the conditions, because it appeared that the wind would lay almost completely down and then start to really kick up and a little bit of chill in that breeze too?
KEVIN KISNER: There is a little chill in it.  It was almost no wind for the first eight or nine holes and then, shoot, on 18 I just hit 5-iron in there.  So it's definitely going to kick up and I hope it blows about 40 this afternoon.
Q. Can you talk about the performance there from Luke today in terms of he hasn't played in a couple months and clearly you both were playing well.
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I played with him, I think the last time he played I think I was paired with him.  He looked like the same old Luke from the old days.  He's driving a little better and his short game and putting is always really sharp.  So he's a good guy to have out here and obviously he's looking to get back to playing well.
Q. Do you feel like your game's heading in the right direction right now?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I've been playing solid all year, man, I just hadn't done anything special yet.  I just need to have one of those days that everything goes in or one of those weekends for good things happen.
