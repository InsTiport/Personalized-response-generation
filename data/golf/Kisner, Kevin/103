Q. What's it like to know you've made it to the season finale?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I thought I was pretty much guaranteed coming into the week, so I probably didn't get as motivated for this week as I needed to and just didn't play well this week, but excited to get a good round today so I can be into next week and hopefully play well.
Q. What do you know about East Lake and what are you most excited about for the course?
KEVIN KISNER: I have never played it, so I've been there on a recruiting visit when I went to Georgia Tech on a recruiting visit, but that is the only time I've ever been there.  I'm excited to get on Bermuda greens.  That's what I grew up playing, so I look forward to that, and hopefully we'll have good weather and have a lot of people there watching, close to Athens.  A lot of Dawgs coming out, and hopefully I'll give them something to watch.
Q. So you went to a recruiting visit but you didn't play it?
KEVIN KISNER: No, I just went out there and looked around.
Q. What has been the key to you reaching Atlanta this year?
KEVIN KISNER: I've played well all year.  I drove the ball a lot better.  There's three areas I wanted to get better at, ball-striking and driving the golf ball and make my bunker play better, which I have, and I've just been in contention a lot more this year.  That breeds confidence, and that's what helped propel me to have a good year.
