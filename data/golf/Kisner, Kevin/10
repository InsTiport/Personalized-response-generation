Q. Can you talk about your round, how you would assess your round today?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I have drove it well in the fairway, which I have to do with the longer golf course, and on the harder holes, you have to be in the fairway and I was able to do that.  It's a weird mix of holes, probably a handful of birdie holes or seven birdie holes and there's seven or eight holes you feel like you have to make par.  I was able to play aggressive on the easier holes and play my way around for par on the harder ones.
Q. Did the rain change your plan at all from yesterday to today?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I hit more 3-irons in than I wanted to.  The conditions are soft and guys are going to tear it up.  With the greens being that soft and that pure, you can fly it right at the hole and make a lot of putts.  So you've got to be aggressive and shoot low.
Q. How excited are you to have 15 million on the line to win the FedExCup?
KEVIN KISNER: You play the whole year to get into the FedExCup Playoffs.  It's a different format for us this year with only three events, so puts more emphasis on THE NORTHERN TRUST and over in Chicago at the BMW.  We are all striving to play well in these first two and set ourselves up for a big Atlanta.
