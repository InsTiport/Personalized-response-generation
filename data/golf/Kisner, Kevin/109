Q. You handled yourself very well, considering it's the second playoff you've been in in three weeks.  How did it feel?KEVIN KISNER: It was cool.  I was calm all day.  I felt awesome out there playing.  I've been in that situation just a few weeks ago, so I probably relied on that a lot, coming down the stretch. But I hit every shot like I wanted to.  I thought I made it in regulation, I really did.  I thought that was over right then.  My hat's off to Rickie, he played great.  Two great birdies on 17, just came up short.  I'll get mine.Q. Sometimes when you play and you're playing against great players like that, they're going to make birdies, just got to match it and do what you can?KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, absolutely.  You don't expect out here for anybody to hand it to you.  These guys are all good and everybody's going to step up when the time's needed. And if you're in that position, you're playing well, so you have confidence.  And everybody, you know, this playoff was really good and the way guys closed it out, everybody made birdies coming in down the stretch to get to the playoff. So, it was a cool way to finish and I'm looking forward to getting to Charlotte and playing again.Q. Two putts on 18, one in regulation and, I mean, obviously, you felt like you made both of those.KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I thought that the second one in the playoff was short when it was rolling.  But it got a little further than I thought as it rolled down there and it looked like it could have gone in there at the end. But 27 feet or whatever I was, give it a chance, that's all I was looking to do. Like I said, I thought I won in regulation, I hit a great putt like I wanted to, and just didn't happen.  But I'll have more chances.Q. The first step that you took after that putt was left, was the look of a guy who thought the ball was going in.KEVIN KISNER: In regulation?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I watched Chris Kirk right before me on the same line, his putt snapped and it was like right edge with two feet to go breaking left.  I don't know how it missed.  But somehow it did and we'll get back after it next week and try to win again.Q. Are you playing next week?KEVIN KISNER: I am, yeah.
