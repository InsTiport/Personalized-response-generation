KEVIN KISNER: I've never seen so many putts left short for me today.  I had a chance on the front to shoot three or four under, but never got it going.   
 Q.  What's next for you?  
KEVIN KISNER: A week off and then a team event.   
 Q.  You're working on what?  
KEVIN KISNER: Just keep grinding on things I've been working on and trying to hole some more putts.   
 Q.  Was it just miserable out here?  
KEVIN KISNER: It wasn't that bad.  It was just difficult to get it close.  They put al the Sunday pins that are already difficult and then you add 29 mile an hour wind, it's hard to get it close.  The greens are firming up.  The last three or four are not easy as you can see, the leaders are backing up.
