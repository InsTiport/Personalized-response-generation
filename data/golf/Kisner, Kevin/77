 Q.  7-under today, South Carolina native.  What's the biggest difference today?  
KEVIN KISNER: I had a lot of three-putts yesterday so I was pretty frustrated with my game when I finished.  I worked on it for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon and felt more confident today.  Started knocking in some of those putts in here.   
 Q.  What is the biggest difference between this golf course and anywhere else?  
KEVIN KISNER: I just feel like it's a great shot maker's course.  You can be in the fairway and have to carve shots into the pin.  It kind of suits my game.  I love to see the picture and try to hit the shots.   
 Q.  Seven birdies, no bogeys, you took it low today, how did you do it out there?  
KEVIN KISNER: I struck the ball just as well as I did yesterday.  But I started holing putts.  Yesterday I had a lot of three-putts.  Kind of worked on that yesterday.  Worked on my setup.  And the putts started going in.  And this is one of my favorite places on Tour.  So I love playing on the weekend here.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you about the great crowd support, walking up 18, you get a huge ovation.  Aiken, South Carolina, this is your turf, man, right?  
KEVIN KISNER: Absolutely.  These are my people, as I say.  So I love it.  Love it here.  One of my favorite weeks of the year.  I look forward to it every year.   
 Q.  Prospects for the weekend now?  You're right there.  Right in the fight for the tournament championship.  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I think with the weather it's going to probably take at least ten or 12 more, so I'm going to have to get after it again the next two days.
