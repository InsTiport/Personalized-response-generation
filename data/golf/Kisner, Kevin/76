Q. How do you feel walking off?
KEVIN KISNER: Well not happy, I had it right there in the palm of my hand to win and I didn't get it done.  2-over on the back nine is not good enough.  So I got to get better and I'll work on that.
Q. Obviously conditions were a little different today than when you played yesterday.
KEVIN KISNER: It was weird.  I hit a couple shots there on 15 and 17 I thought were perfect and the ball just wouldn't stay on the grown.  The greens just got a little too firm, not too firm, but it got firmer.  But I hit some good shots, I just didn't hole any putts on the back nine.
Q. You mentioned the things that you need to work on, what does it feel like you need to get better at?
KEVIN KISNER: Obviously I just need to keep putting myself in that position and keep knocking on the door.  But I was pretty comfortable out there, I hit a lot of shots like I wanted to, but the putts just didn't go in on the back nine like I needed them to.
Q. Was there a key turning point in the round for you?
KEVIN KISNER: There on 15 and 16 I thought I hit two great shots and neither one of them on the green.  Both ended up pretty dead.  That's just the nature of the beast on Sunday on the PGA TOUR, the golf course turns and gets very difficult and you got to be in the right position and I was not in the right position on either hole.
