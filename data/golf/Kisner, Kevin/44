Q. Came down to the final hole.  A lot of options off the tee here, and you decided to layup.
KEVIN KISNER: I was not sure where it was going to end up based off the kick off the drive.  I knew I could hit a wedge and take my chances from there.
Q. You said yesterday there would be a lot of needling between you and Kuchar in this match, was there?
KEVIN KISNER: I think the needles were with the birdies.  Every hole was a birdie.  We played well.  It was a fun match.  We spent a lot of time together.  We had fun out there.
