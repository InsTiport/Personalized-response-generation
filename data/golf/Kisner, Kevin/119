 Q.   Does it feel great playing here at Harbour Town?   
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, it's good.   Having a lot of fun.   A lot of local people out watching me, so enjoying that.   Just looking forward to the weekend.   I'm in the right position to have a good weekend and hopefully can keep it going.  
   
 Q.   Looks like the birdies are coming.   You had six today, another great round.   
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I did.   I hit the ball close a lot, which you should be able to make some putts out here, if you get it on the green, because the greens are so small.  
Made some birdies.   Just need to eliminate some bogeys.   And obviously I'm going to have to put the pedal down the way these guys are shooting the grass off it today.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about the weekend, incorporating in the great support you're going to get as a South Carolina native?  
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I want to see how many tickets I've got to go get now for the weekend.   
No, it's always fun.   I only have two tournaments that people can drive to, here and Charlotte.   So I welcome them all, and hopefully I can keep performing.
