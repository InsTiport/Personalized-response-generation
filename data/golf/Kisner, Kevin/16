 Q.  Given the conditions, how much do you take from a day like today?  
KEVIN KISNER: We played four seasons in one day it looked like.  Just amazing how short the ball can be in the wind and rain and how far it can go when it's sunny and downwind.  It's totally drastic.  I don't know if it's any technical work, it's just trying to hit the shots.   
 Q.  You talked about what happened to Dewey and how JC did.  
KEVIN KISNER: JC was good.  We had a good time.  It's just so different.  The routine is different and trying to figure out -- me doing my own yardages for the first time in a long time, not really paying any attention to it early in the week because Dewey always caddied early in the week.   
So it was a little different but I think in the end it could probably help me.  So he can see it live in the flesh right beside me and see what happens in certain situations.   
 Q.  What happened to Dewey?  
KEVIN KISNER: He did something to his calf muscle yesterday walking across the chipping green.  It was his right.  He obviously has massive calves.  Who knows.  He was going to try to get an image of it when we teed off, so I haven't heard anymore.   
 Q.  You're still in a good position?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, just all depends on what happens.  If the wind quits and it's sunny the rest of the afternoon I could be in 40th or if it blows 30 I could be in 10th, you never know around here.   
 Q.  How much do you enjoy this kind of golf?  
KEVIN KISNER: I think it's fun.  It's amazing when it's going great how much fun it is and how trying it is when it's not.  I found bunkers off the tee that I didn't know were out there.  I knew they were out there.  I didn't know they were in play in certain shots.   
It was just a grind.  That's all it is.  You kind of throw the mechanics out and just try and hit shots.   
 Q.  Seemingly everybody else loves this golf course.  
KEVIN KISNER: I think it's fantastic.  It's just awesome, really.  It's longer than most of the links we play, probably.  But the perfect placement of bunkers and hard holes into the wind today was hard, and the easier holes downwind.  I think it's a great mix of holes.   
 Q.  How was this different from the other Opens you played?  
KEVIN KISNER: I think there's not as much room off the tee.  It really pinches in on certain yardages.  You've got to be real strategic with your yard and your number because of how much it pinches in.  It's not just one wide fairway with bunkers.  There's different angles that are way more difficult.   
 Q.  Gets your attention that opening tee shot, I guess?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I was asking, why did they have to do that to us, those little stakes all the way down there.  With a crosswind you wanted to get it down there far enough because the second shot is tough.  It's not just like we're chipping 5-irons off the tee.  We've got to go out and hit it.
