Q. Kevin, this is the first time you are playing in this event.  When was the last time you played match play? How comfortable are you in this format?
KEVIN KISNER: I don't think I've played since I first turned professional.  In 2007, I played eGolf Tour down in Hilton Head, South Carolina and I was fortunate to win there.  That's what I'm kind of building off of, last time I played it.  Interesting playing against an opponent, didn't get to play the back nine there.  Kind of a grind there at the end.
Cool golf course.  Looking forward to the rest of the week.
Q. Tight match here with so much wind out there.  Anything can happen on any hole.  Well done.
KEVIN KISNER: It was difficult there.  You don't want to miss it in the wrong spots.  Got a little tighter than I wanted it to, but glad to get it done.
Q. First time in this tournament for you?
KEVIN KISNER: I haven't played it in over a year.  Just kind of get back to the grind.  Everything is good.
Q. You had the flu?
KEVIN KISNER: We all three got a little stomach virus.  I got it starting Sunday night.
