KEVIN KISNER: Very favorable for low scores, and what a good group we had.  Everybody was making birdies and having lot of fun, so it made it a lot easier.   
 Q.  What's it is key for you to play this golf course well?  
KEVIN KISNER: I have to keep it in the fairway, which is difficult with some of the winds and how fast the fairways were going, but today I was able to do that and hopefully keep doing it through the weekend.   
 Q.  The greens, obviously, most guys talk about the greens here.  How were they for you?  
KEVIN KISNER: I love these greens.  They were a little less grainy than last week and more like what I grew up on, so I feel very comfortable with them.   
 Q.  7-under par opening round on a course that you told Steve Sands doesn't fit your eye.  How do you explain today's success?  
KEVIN KISNER: I must have gotten better since the last few times I played here.  I've always struggled at this course, coming over, being a little rusty from the East Coast and cold weather and trying to adjust.  But this year I got to go to Maui and get kind of the rust off and the game feels good.   
 Q.  How much did the pairing that you had today, the group factor into your round?  All of you play at the same pace, very fast and you're making birdies left and right.  How much did that affect you?  
KEVIN KISNER: It was awesome.  Have those guys, they're good buddies and good guys, and we just had a good chat, and then when the balls started going in, they started going in for everybody and everybody was having fun, and kind of keeps you going.
