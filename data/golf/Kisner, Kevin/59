 Q.  How did you end up with Phil?  
KEVIN KISNER: What, did we throw you a curveball?   
 Q.  It looked like it, yeah.  
KEVIN KISNER: Phil and I play a lot of golf together, and we have a good relationship on the trash-talking.  So we thought we would be a good match-up with that.  I love the way he always grinds it out and gets it together, and he lives for these moments, so that brings out the best in him.   
 Q.  How important is it for you, going out in your first match, that you've got a guy that's played in every one of him?  
KEVIN KISNER: Oh, I'll be relying on him heavy.  I've already been telling him that all day.  I'm like, you have to got to tell me what the hell to do. I don't have a clue what I'm doing out here.  I just want to hit it straight.  I told him every time he has to hit it from the fairway, he'll probably be uncomfortable.  But other than that, we'll be good to go.   
 Q.  Coming up against the Aussies?  
KEVIN KISNER: Oh, for sure, they are good friends, good guys, play with them a ton on TOUR and we'll have a lot of fun and I'm sure it will be a fun, exciting match.   
 Q.  Expecting a sledging, the trash talking?  
KEVIN KISNER: Oh, for sure.  Me and J-Day will go at it all day, too.  Leisch too laid back for that.   
 Q.  Who is your pod captain this week?  
KEVIN KISNER: Davis.   
 Q.  What's your first memory of watching any of those assistants on TV?  Was it watching Tiger on TV?  
KEVIN KISNER: Man, I'm not a very good golf guy to ask that.  I don't watch a lot of golf.  They know; they ask me that all the time.  I always remember Tiger dominating, any time you watched golf on Sunday, he was winning, wearing red.  But now I've played with these other guys so much except Freddie.  I didn't meet Freddie until this week.  We've had a lot of fun getting to know each other.   
 Q.  Playing with Phil Mickelson --  
KEVIN KISNER: Doesn't get any better than that, does it.   
 Q.  Do you make sure that you're level --  
KEVIN KISNER: No, I think he probably wants me to be as hyped up as I can be.  He's fired up.  He's grabbing me every five minutes and telling me something that I don't understand, and then we go on.  So looking forward to that.   
I I'm just looking forward to having chances to win holes for him and he lives for that stuff, man.  We played a great match today, and you should have seen him when the back was against the wall, the best came out.   
 Q.  You're not teeing off until 1:53.  Do you have any fear of what you're going to do killing all that time, being so amped up?  
KEVIN KISNER: I have a three-year-old and a two-week old with me, so I have plenty of stuff to do in the morning.  I'll be changing diapers and watching the three-year-old terrorize everybody else on the team.   
 Q.  Can you talk about Leisch and Jason's games, what kind of threat they pose to you and thrill?  
KEVIN KISNER: Well, they are probably, if not the two strongest on the team right now.  Jason has been playing great for them and Leisch has obviously been playing unbelievable.  We've got a tall task ahead of us.   
 Q.  What was the math today?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, Phil and I played DJ and Kuch.  We played the front nine best-ball, on the back nine, alternate-shot.  We were losing badly and Phil started knocking it stiff and making putts, and the chirping was alive and well.   
 Q.  Earlier this week, Phil said he didn't want to hit the first shot --  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, because he blocks at everything.  I don't mind it now.  I just didn't know it.  I didn't know the hole.  Every time y'all showed me a picture, I'm like how do you hit that fairway.  It will go down off the right and I'll be able to sling it off the right a little bit.   
 Q.  Did you win?  
KEVIN KISNER: We lost.  DJ is playing unbelievable.   
 Q.  Do you know what ball you're playing?  
KEVIN KISNER: Phil is playing my ball.   
 Q.  Things we've heard mentioned from veterans about the new guys is don't feel the need to apologize.  Has Phil talked to you about that, like if you get him in a bad spot?  
KEVIN KISNER: That's funny, because he said sorry a couple times today, and I said, "There's no sorry in this game."    But we all know how hard it is.  I don't expect say sorry from anyone.  I know he's trying his best.  He's doing whatever we can to win.  I'll do whatever I can and hopefully we'll come out on top.   
 Q.  What's been the highlight of your week?  
KEVIN KISNER: Just hanging out, man.  It's so much fun to hang out with these guys.  You get to see the full side of them get to really know each other.  Obviously we spend all day every day with each other, and have a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Do you work on your handshake or your high-five?  Phil and Zach had a very elaborate?  
KEVIN KISNER: We might have something for you tomorrow, I don't know.  I'm sure we'll have something.  You'll just have to wait and see.  Hopefully I'll make that putt on the first hole.   
I think it's going to be live by the seat of my pants, whatever happens.  I'm grinding so hard out there, it's hard for me to show a lot of emotion, but I'm sure things like that happen, I'm sure you'll see a little electricity.   
 Q.  You put out a Tweet of, anybody got a helicopter?  
KEVIN KISNER: To get me from not having to ride the boat?  I'm sure we can fly one over.  We've been trying to get Mr. Fireman to let us use his boat out there.  I don't mind the boat.   
 Q.  Pretty easy?  
KEVIN KISNER: Absolutely.  Probably take just as long in a helicopter.   
 Q.  Have you played here before this week?  
KEVIN KISNER: No, first time.   
 Q.  What do you think of the setting?  
KEVIN KISNER: It's cool, man.  Especially that back nine.   
 Q.  What's the story of the chip?  
KEVIN KISNER: They gave it to us to give out to people.  If we don't have time to sign autographs or something, we hand them out.
