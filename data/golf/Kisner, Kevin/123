  THE MODERATOR:   You were 2â€‘back, wind was high, can you talk about your round? 
KEVIN KISNER:   Played solid, no bogeys and that wind is always good.   I felt the course was set up very fair, with how much the wind was going to blow.   They gave you opportunities to make birdies, they could have made it very difficult. 
I was pleased with no bogeys, didn't take advantage of the par 5s as much as I would like, but it was a solid round. 

Q.   You made two cuts on the west coast.   How would you describe your year? 
KEVIN KISNER:   It's been up and down.   It's been solid, more than last year, but I haven't finished high, missed a cut by 1 once and 2 another time, so I've been close but never shot the low round that you need to propel yourself up into the top ten. 

Q.   The media is talking about the wind.   Do you consider yourself a good wind player? 
KEVIN KISNER:   I think you just try to manufacture shots and get yourself around the green, and that's what I try to do a lot, and it plays to my hand that way.   And if it's blowin' hard, you're going to have stuff come up and it's not going to be easy.   You just try to stay patient and stay in the game.
