 Q.  The match you had today with Patrick Reed, I believe Patrick kept making some incredible up-and-downs.  
KEVIN KISNER: After yesterday, I played Brooks, he made everything, so I was kind of accustomed to it.  It seems like everybody was making everything against me this week.  I hung in there to get a win.   
 Q.  You played beautifully last week at the Arnold Palmer.  Did you feel good coming into this event?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I was probably drained earlier in the week.  Quick turnaround so I had to get it going again.  Yesterday I didn't play well, so today I played much better.  I didn't make a lot of birdies, but it was windy and tough.  I just hung in there all day.   
 Q.  Talk about the conditions out there.  Sometimes it's even hard to maintain any kind of balance.  
KEVIN KISNER: The putting for me is the hardest.  I don't feel like I can stay stable over it.  I guess I need to put on some pounds.   
 Q.  You had to win today against Patrick Reed.  Obviously his match play record speaks for itself.  How did you get it done?  
KEVIN KISNER: I just played my game and didn't pay much attention to what he was doing.  I made a lot of birdies on the front.  Got off to a good start, so that was good.  It's a battle coming in along that water and the wind is howling.  It's tough to make putts, and that's what it came down to is neither one of us made anything coming in here at the end.   
 Q.  What's your mindset coming into these final days?  You are praying for results to go your way.  How does that affect the mind?  
KEVIN KISNER: I'll be a big Patrick Reed fan tomorrow.  I've got a tough match in Duf.  We'll have a good time.  I've got to handle my deal and see what happens.   
 Q.  One of the most anticipated matches of the day, you and Patrick Reed.  A couple of bulldogs going at each other.  What was it like out there?  
KEVIN KISNER: He's tough.  I like to think we both have the same mindset when it comes to golf.  It was a great match.  We played well.  The conditions are brutal.  I was lucky to get out of there with a win.   
 Q.  You are one of those guys that has that tough exterior.  When you are playing someone similar to you, does it give you more juice inside?  
KEVIN KISNER: He keeps coming back at you and making putts, so you have got to keep grinding.  That is how the match played out today.  We both kind of putted on top of each other.  It was fun.  It was a fun match and the golf course was fun to play in match play.  We had a good time.
