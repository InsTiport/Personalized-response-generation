Q. Kevin, five days, seven matches, how difficult is it to win this event?
KEVIN KISNER: I was thinking out there it might be the hardest one just because you have the physical aspect more than any other week.  It was grueling, definitely with the winds, the temperature today.  Overall it was a long week, but I prevailed and World Golf champion.
Q. You had a tough time last year in the final against Bubba Watson.  You told us yesterday you were going to treat today differently, how so?
KEVIN KISNER: Well, I just learned a lot.  I learned about preparation.  I learned not to get too amped up for that final.  You still have to come out and play golf.  I don't think either one of us played our best golf.  But I drove it great all week with my Callaway driver, and love my good week.
