 Q.  Is it easy to sort of reprocess when you get in a situation after one match, then head back out against someone else?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, it's not hard.  You're kind of in that mindset already.  I was trying to close out Keith and went straight into trying to beat Poulter.  It doesn't matter who you're playing, you know you have to make birdies to win.   
 Q.  How close were you guys to teeing off (inaudible).  
KEVIN KISNER: I don't think he would have.  I would have in a heartbeat.  What are they going to do, penalize us?  We'd both be on the same stroke, anyway.   
 Q.  You've played a lot of golf already this year.  Anything different (inaudible)?  
KEVIN KISNER: I think if I get through I'll bring some clothes and shower and try to reset in between rounds, if I keep getting through, is kind of what I told myself instead of just hanging out hitting balls.  I'll try to take it more like starting a whole new day.   
 Q.  How do you compared where you are right now with your game at this point last year?  
KEVIN KISNER: Way different.  I was still trying to make some changes that John Tillery and I were working on and now I feel way more comfortable with them.  Of all things I'm putting way worse.  So I'm trying to get that going.  I just felt horrible over the putter the last three weeks.  And finally made a few there late against Keith and made that one against Poulter.  Finally hitting some good putts.  I've just been hitting some horrible looking putts and that's just not normal for me.
