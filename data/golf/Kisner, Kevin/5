Q. Did you enjoy the test?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yes, a lot of fun.
Q. Do you mean that seriously?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, it was fun.
Q. What is your aim for the week?
KEVIN KISNER:   I think even par wins the golf tournament.
Q. Are you locked in, do you think, for next week?  Has anyone told you?
KEVIN KISNER:   I'm not smart enough to figure that out.
Q. What do you think about the weekend in terms of where you are and what it's taken to get here so far?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I mean, you've got to hit really quality golf shots and get lucky.  That's basically the tune to it.  You've got to try to hit your number and then hope it does what you're praying it does when it hits the ground.
Q. Is it fair?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah.  I mean, it's not long because it's playing so fast.
Q. What I'm asking is if you need luck, how is it fair if you need luck?
KEVIN KISNER:   Because there's swirling winds and the greens are rock hard and the fairways are rock hard and you've got to play all bounces.  Is fair how the ball bounces?  I don't know.  Is the British Open fair?  Yeah?  Here is fair.
Q. Is it more like a British or a U.S.?
KEVIN KISNER:   It's a mixture of both.
Q. How so?
KEVIN KISNER:   So firm.  I hit just a 370-yard 3-wood on 17.
Q. Is that unusual for you?
KEVIN KISNER:   Very.  I still made bogey, though.
Q. I didn't know you finished bogey-bogey.  I don't know how many guys are under par right now.  Unless we get any rain --
KEVIN KISNER:   I don't know if any rain will matter, really.  There's no grass, so it's not going to hold anything.  I think even par wins the golf tournament.
