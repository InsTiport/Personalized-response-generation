Q. Were you satisfied with the way you played?
KEVIN KISNER: It was pretty poor.  I made zero putts coming in.  Back-9 was a struggle.  The speed.  I don't know if it's from last week, little slower from last week.  Never hit anything close.  Got to get the 8, 9, wedges dialed in.
Q. Mentally, emotionally, did you have everything in your tank today coming off everything you went through at Quail Hollow?
KEVIN KISNER: I felt good out there.  Just hot.  Beating me up with the temperature.  Other than that, it was good day.  Golf course is in good shape.  I need to get rolling tomorrow.
Q. As much as you love this golf course, how much are you looking forward to the 2nd Round?
KEVIN KISNER: I hope the greens will be rolling a little better in the morning.  Look forward to making some putts.  That's where I live.  If I'm not making putts, I'm going to struggle to contend.  Hopefully they go in tomorrow.
