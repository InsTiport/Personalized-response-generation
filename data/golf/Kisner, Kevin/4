  Q. It's been awhile since you've defended your title a couple of years ago.  COVID, the pandemic, not able to play last year.  What is it about this format that you like so much?
 KEVIN KISNER:   I just love the grind, man.  I love competing one-on-one, I love playing strategy against my opponent and not just playing over four days.
 Q. There's a lot of ways to go about your business on this golf course, two years ago you didn't get off to the greatest of starts, you ended up going all the way to Sunday and winning, so how key is it to actually get a victory on a Wednesday here?
 KEVIN KISNER:   It's nice to get off to a good start, but there's still a lot of work to be done.  You got to go out and win a couple other matches or at least get a halve or a win to get through, so tomorrow is a big day.
