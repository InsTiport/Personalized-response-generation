Q.   Just kind of sum up the week and thoughts.
KEVIN KISNER:   It was a good week.   I just didn't play well there at the end.   But it was cool to get to come down and play and see the golf course and learn it and hopefully many more years playing here.

Q.   Your thoughts on today and you had it kind of going early.
KEVIN KISNER:   Played tough there at the end.   Greens got firm.   I was missing my numbers by a little bit and not making any putts.   That was basically the gist of it.

Q.   Did you get caught up on sleep?
KEVIN KISNER:   I'm all good now.   I'm going to go home and hang out for the family.

Q.   Head to San Antonio?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah.
