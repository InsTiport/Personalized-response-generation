Q. First time you've stepped your foot in the water here.  I assume this is the type of thing you don't want to miss going forward?
KEVIN KISNER: Matt Kuchar has always told me, if you make one, you don't want to miss another one, and I got that same feeling today.  What a lot of fun the last week was hanging out with these guys and competing as a team and pulling for all those putts to go in.
Q. You're an adrenaline junkie; this really fits to your persona as it relates to competition.
KEVIN KISNER: You couldn't get a bigger rush than to pair up with Phil and hitting the first tee shot on alternate-shot day.  That's about as much as I could take there, and that was a lot of fun.
Q. That dance with Mickelson how long did it take to choreograph that?
KEVIN KISNER: I think we ran through it about twice, laughed our head off, and then he said walking off the tee, "When I make this putt, we're doing it."
