  Q. How would you assess your first match win?
 KEVIN KISNER:   It was a solid day.  I played solid.  I didn't make a lot of putts.  Neither one of us did.  Got a little work to do to continue to play well throughout the week with the flat stick.
 Q. Did it kind of get better on the back nine to make that comeback?
 KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I hit two great shots on both par-5s.  Obviously making eagle on 12 with that hole location is a beautiful shot.
 And then that wedge shot on 16 was big because he was probably a little bit ahead and in advantage on that hole being closer, but I knew if I could stick one in there and get it tight, things would go well.  But lucky enough to get a win there.
 Q. Just continue to relish match play and the mano-a-mano?
 KEVIN KISNER:   I love that atmosphere, man, I love being able to just play one-on-one and know what I have to do all 18 holes, I think that's a lot of fun.
 Q. Do you kind of change your mentality about the format?  Do you still feel that pressure on Wednesday to win that first match or do you know like, hey, I can get through without a win on Wednesday?
 KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I think it's brutal all three days, not knowing -- you've got to kind of rely on other people if you don't win all three, and I think it's very difficult to win all three.  Who knows what tomorrow and Friday hold, but hopefully I know if I win the next two, I'm through.
 Q. Is it putting kind of the one thing you need to improve on for tomorrow?
 KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I need to drive it a little bit better and continue to hit solid iron shots, but the putter has got to get warm to beat most of these guys out here.
