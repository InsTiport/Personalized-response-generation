Q. How long have you guys been working on that move?
KEVIN KISNER: I think he panicked, I panicked and it just kind of happened.  I'm not sure what happened, but it was a lot of fun.
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm clearly the worst selfie taker.  Who takes a selfie and crops himself out?  I'm the worst Three Amigos dancer but I can putt.
Q. Let's talk about the difference between yesterday and today.  Yesterday you had a lead, and you got a half point.  Today, you're behind.  You weren't even up in this match, or even in this match until the 15th hole.  How satisfying is that?
PHIL MICKELSON: It only matters how the match stands at the end of the day after 18.  We had to fight hard.  They birdied the first four holes on us.  We were fighting to stay in it all the way through.  This guy made three birdies the first eight holes to keep us in it, and it feels incredible to finish this match like this.
Q. I know how much making this team meant to you and how much you have been looking forward to this.  Has it been difficult to keep your emotions in check?
KEVIN KISNER: I feel pretty good out there.  He's been fantastic keeping me in line.  We've been chatting it up a lot.  Figured out our new concept:  Whenever I really need him, I dump it in the water and he takes care of the rest.
It's been fantastic.  I love team events.  I love being Phil's partner.  I love being out here in front of these crowds and having all these people cheering for us.
Q. 23 straight years playing on American teams, what is the perspective on that for you? Does it ever get old?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm getting chills as we speak, as you can see.  Every event, I just cherish.  Playing with guys like this; this team is a special team.  We have some incredible talent, and not only that, we have incredible energy and camaraderie amongst these guys.  This is really laying a good foundation for the United States teams this year and years to come.
Q. What's it like playing with the great man here?  He has so many points in these events.  What's it like?
KEVIN KISNER: I told him from the first tee shot yesterday, I was going to rely heavily on him throughout the two days, and nothing bigger than that putt on the last hole.  He's a phenomenal player.  He's got the record that speaks for itself and I'm going to ride him as long as they let me.
Q. You've got a commanding lead.  How do you get the boys in there and go, this is not done yet?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, we'll have to let it calm down.  Right now we've got this wave of momentum, adrenaline, excitement, and it's going to carry on for a little while longer.  But Captain Stricker will grab all of us together tonight and let everything kind of calm down and refocus for tomorrow, because we understand how great the players are on the International Team, what quality golf they are able to play, how close these matches have been, and how much work we have left to do.
