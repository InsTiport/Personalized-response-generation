 Q. Kevin, a solid 4-under par 66 in the first round. You're a rookie. That's got to feel good to bury the first round that way. 
 KEVIN KISNER: It is. It's always tough to get off to a good start. You can't win it on Thursday but you can sure lose it. Gave myself a good shot at it. Look forward to getting it back going tomorrow.

 Q. What's been the biggest adjustment for you as a rookie?
 KEVIN KISNER: I think trying to learn the courses. The courses are much more difficult than the Nationwide. You really have to know where you're going to miss it and places to be. It's all just part of learning. It's why they call you a rookie.

 Q. Have there been any players out here that have influenced you over the years even maybe before you got out here and met them as do how you play?
 KEVIN KISNER: Not really. I've always watched golf and been a fan and tried to learn from anyone I've played with. 
 I don't think one individual that really taught me much about this, you know, experience; that I had a friend that played on Tour in the late '90s when I was probably 12, I got the PGA experience then. A lot has changed since then. Bigger stage now.

 Q. What are you working on this time of the year? Are there any changes to be made? Because sometimes you see rookies start chasing a good swing. You have to stick with the one that got you here.
 KEVIN KISNER: Absolutely. I didn't hit the ball very good at the start of the year, but I knew at some point it was going to come back. I just kept grinding and found it, and my short game was really good today which I've been working a lot on. I think if you can drive the ball in the fairway and putt out here, you can play.

 Q. Good start. Keep it up this week.
