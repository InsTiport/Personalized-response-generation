 Q.  4-under.  Your first competitive go this course.  Talk about your round a little bit.  
KEVIN KISNER: I got off to a hot start and holed some nice putts.  But a little rust showed up there coming in around the turn, 7, 8, 9, 10.  But I kind of righted the ship and started hitting some better shots coming in and nice to birdie the last hole.   
 Q.  What did you learn in your days coming up to this event that helped you in this, for this golf course?  
KEVIN KISNER: It was weird because it was firm the first couple days and then after that rain yesterday, it's kind of changed.  It's not as short as I remember seeing it on TV.  I was thinking it was going to be a lot shorter and easier to shoot a lot under.  But it's still a great golf course, it's really cool views and what a good walk it is around here.   
 Q.  A little bit warmer today.  The wind changed.  The course was a little wetter.  Did it play a little differently with the warmer temperatures?  
KEVIN KISNER: The ball was going with the irons a little more than it has in the week.  I don't know if that was adrenaline from actually playing in a tournament and having to count your score for the first time in a while or not.  But the warmth got the ball going, but it's just not tumbling in the fairways like we have seen early in the week.  But hopefully by the end of the week we'll get it going again.
