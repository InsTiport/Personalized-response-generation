 Q. Overall, second Masters appearance, what's your take on how you played?  
KEVIN KISNER: I didn't get it done. I just didn't have it this week. It's one of those weeks that, if it was any other week, none of ya'll would say a word, but it's the Masters.   
I hit the ball great, I'm really confident with the ball striking, so if I clean up the mistakes, I'm looking forward to the rest of the year.   
   
 Q. What is the take away for you from this week?  
KEVIN KISNER: Just I continue to learn out here every time I play it. It's one of those places, when everything's going your way, you love it, and when they're not working out, you want to take your ball and go home.  
   
 Q. Do you take any solace from the fact that you made the cut your first two Masters?  
KEVIN KISNER: I'm not out here to make cuts. If I'm going to finish 40th, I might as well stay at home, you know? So I'm going to keep working and hopefully be back next year to contend.   
   
 Q. You had a couple birdies on the back nine there. What was working on those holes?  
KEVIN KISNER: Well, the back nine is playing so easy, they're almost giving away a few of them. 6â€‘iron into 15, which I've never done in my life.   
So I would look for somebody to shoot in the 20s on that back nine today.
