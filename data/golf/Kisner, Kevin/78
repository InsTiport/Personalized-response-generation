Q. Great opening round.  That's a lot of birdies on a day like today.  It's playing tough out there, most guys are saying it.  Do you feel confident making that many out there?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, it was a good day for me.  You got to attack the par-5s here.  It's not often we get four par-5s.  So handled a couple of those and hit a few other good shots.  Golf course is hard, but it's in perfect shape.
Q. When you missed today you got up-and-down.  You're perfect from the bunker and six of eight total in scrambling.  Is that something you think is going to be a bit of a theme through the weekend, if you miss here you better have some shots?
KEVIN KISNER: If you're in the rough you have no chance really to get on the green.  So you got -- I worked hard on my short game this week, because I knew it was going to be a big, big deal to be able to get up-and-down.  But the golf course is so good, you're in perfect lies every time you miss a green.  As long as you're in the fairway, it's good to go.
Q. Before we let you go, in the practice rounds players were talking about the softness of greens.  Now we're hearing maybe there's a bounce in them.  Are they firming up?
KEVIN KISNER: I thought they were super firm yesterday in all that wind and early on I didn't think they were as firm.  But here at the end they're starting to firm up, so the boys should have fun this afternoon.
