 Q.  63, Kevin.  Nice way to finish up another good week here at the Wyndham.  
KEVIN KISNER: Yup.  Played solid.  Played really well today.  Had a lot of chances all week to make putts and today they started going in.  Obviously I wish I wouldn't have finished it off this way.  Good week, nice after two weeks off to get that going for the Playoffs.   
 Q.  I was going to say, projected to move into the Top-10 so you're set-up for a really good stretch run here.  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah.  I was trying to go ahead and get where I was already in the Tour Championship would be huge for these Playoffs with each event, kind of free-wheel it and try to focus on a chance of winning the big deal.
