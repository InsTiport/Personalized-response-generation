Q. Just comment a little bit on the round today and on the finish.
KEVIN KISNER: Just got off to a slow start.  The other three days I got off and going and under par early, and that kind of can change your outlook, and got behind the eight ball and never got into a rhythm of making birdies and I never hit really good shots.
Got hot there for a minute making the turn, but just wasn't enough to get up there in the hunt.  I had a chance on 15 to make that putt and have a chance.  Just didn't make the putts coming down the stretch that I needed to make.
Q. But still, another great week for you overall?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah.  It's still early in the year and I haven't been able to work on the things I need to work on.  So I'm going to take these two weeks I have off and really work on the things that motivates me to get better and hopefully be ready to go in Phoenix.
