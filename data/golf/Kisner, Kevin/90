Q. Not able to get any real momentum going?
KEVIN KISNER: I hit the ball fine.  I hit one bad shot on the third hole and just didn't make anything today.  Struggled on the short putts, which are normally one of my best parts.  I don't know, just greens or me.  I'm going to go work on that this afternoon.
Q. So disappointed, because you hit it so well and just couldn't score.
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, just didn't score, man.  He got off to a great start and then I had a chance to get back in it and just couldn't make anything.  And then he obviously finished great.  So hat's off to him.
