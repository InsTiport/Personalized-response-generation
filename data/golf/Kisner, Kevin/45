Q. Did it feel like a long three days?
KEVIN KISNER: Not too bad.  I feel like I'm finally playing good again for the first time in a while.
Q. Why?
KEVIN KISNER: I don't know.  Because my ball is going straight.  If I hit it like that right there, I can play.
Q. On Wednesday, how did that match end?
KEVIN KISNER: I 3-putted 17 from ten feet.  I thought it was going to bite me.  It was a hard situation for me.  Ten feet downhill to win.  Knocked it five feet by.
Q. Did you think that was going to come back and bite you in the pool play?
KEVIN KISNER: Yes.  I mean, after I won today, I was like that's what I deserve is another playoff.
Q. Thoughts on playing Matt tomorrow.
KEVIN KISNER: We'll have a good time needling each other out there.  I just hope he makes a lot of bogeys.
