 Q. Kind of a tough luck there on that last putt there, but overall how do you feel about today?  
KEVIN KISNER: Oh, man, it was a weird day. I made a lot of putts, I shot even par, you would think you would shoot a little better than that after the way I putted. Just wasn't very good around the greens chipping the ball, getting it close enough to clean up some of these bogeys that I made. Hit the ball nice the last 12 or 14 holes, but making a double on 4 was pretty bad and then a couple bogeys in there that you got clean up if you want to win the Tournament.   
   
 Q. Overall do you feel like this was the best you've played out here?  
KEVIN KISNER: I played nice, yeah. I mean, I don't know what my best is, I mean obviously I think I shot better than even par. But I played nice, I'm putting nice, I feel comfortable, the golf course is hard and fast and just beats you up if you put it in the wrong place and that's what's so difficult about it.  
   
 Q. Amen Corner was good to you today.   
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, it was. I made bogey on 11, but I hit two great shots. And that's just what Augusta National does, is you just get off a little bit it's so difficult to make a 4 or a par. And yeah, I got hot there for a minute. 18's playing hard with that back pin, but really would have liked to have finished it off at 1‑under.  
   
 Q. And what will be the approach going into tomorrow?  
KEVIN KISNER: Well I need to get 3‑ or 4‑ under tomorrow to get into position for the weekend. So get off to a better start and the key to around here is to be even or 1‑under after six holes in my opinion and then you can kind of take off from there and I was 1‑over today and the goal was to get to 1‑under through 6 tomorrow.
