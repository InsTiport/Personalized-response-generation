 Q. Well, it wasn't your best day, there was just, was it just the driver, the putter, just didn't get anything to fall all of the above?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I didn't make any putts. I think I hit 16 greens and shot even par. So just didn't have the straight putts, I had a lot of the breaking, fast big swingers that's all speed and didn't make any of them early.   
And then just made a terrible double on 10.  
   
 Q. Were you right in the bunker on 10?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I had a huge mud ball in the right rough and it went way right and was buried in the pine straw. So if it was in the grass it probably would have been an easier four, instead I walk away with six.  
   
 Q. How difficult was the read on that putt on 5?  
KEVIN KISNER: Oh, that's brutal, I hit that in practice and it went way left and tried to play for it today, but if you get it too far right it goes right.   
So it's a new hole location with the new green and I just hit it in the wrong spot, we were trying to hit it past that hole and just a little right of it. I just didn't hit a very good shot.  
   
 Q. Talk about Duane and playing through a broken toe and all what does it mean to you and all?  
KEVIN KISNER: He's a wuss. No, he's out there, he's struggling, this isn't the easiest place in the world to walk, but he's not going to miss it. So he says it's getting better every day and I think he was struggling a little bit today.   
   
 Q. I noticed that too. Like on 9. Do you change your game plan for tomorrow or do you look at the weather and say, okay, we got to do this or how do you approach it?  
KEVIN KISNER: I'm just going to go to try and shoot a low one and try and move up the board, that's the only thing I can do.
