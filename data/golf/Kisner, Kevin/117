Q.   Kevin, bogey‑free 65, great way to end the tournament.   If you can comment on the day.
KEVIN KISNER:   It was a great day.   I played solid from the first tee on.   I gave myself a lot of looks, and I needed a special day, like a make‑it‑from‑everywhere 62 or 1 to have a chance, and I didn't do that, but I made plenty and made a nice par on 18, so it was a good way to finish it off.

Q.   Got better every round this week.   Just comment on the positives from this week and carrying it forward.
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah.   My coach gave me a good little help last night on the range with my driver.   I've been struggling with it the first three days, and today I just bombed it all day, and if you can drive it around here, you can attack the pins.
And that was awesome and helped me improve today, and if I'd have made the putts like I normally do, I would have a good shot at it.

Q.   Thank you, sir.
KEVIN KISNER:   Thank you.
