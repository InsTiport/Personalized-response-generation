  Q. Kevin, how would you assess your round?
 KEVIN KISNER:   Just really hoping somebody makes some bogeys so I don't have to play with Bubba tomorrow.  Just kidding.
 I played solid all day.  Hit really a lot of good quality golf shots and made some nice putts, some big breakers coming in.  It's just brutal.  I see somebody got to 1-under, but I called even par yesterday as winning and I'm looking pretty smart.
 Q. You said even par yesterday, you're 2-over.  If you shoot 2-under tomorrow you're pretty happy --
 KEVIN KISNER:   There's so many guys with a chance.  There's 30 guys within four shots.  Anybody can go out -- the golf course is obviously softer earlier.  You see all the 60s teed off well before 10:00.  It firms up throughout the day as the wind and the sun keeps going.  You've got to watch out for somebody shooting something low early, 66, 67 and then I think we'll all be scrambling trying to post that.
 Q. Biggest key for you tomorrow?
 KEVIN KISNER:   Keeping it in the fairway.  I just need to hole a few more putts.  There's so many big breakers that it's hard to make them.  But made a few coming in.  If I can keep that momentum going tomorrow I might have a shot.
