Q.   What worked so well out there for you on the first round?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I drove it great.   I hit a lot of fairways, I think I only missed one.   If you can do that out here, you can attack it because the greens are not firming up.   Hopefully they stay this week.   Hit it on the fairway, you can make birdies.

Q.   Has that been the key to you on this run you've been having is your ball‑striking?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, I've just driven it so much better this year than prior years on the PGA Tour.   It makes the game seem a lot easier when you're playing from the short stuff.   So hopefully we do that in the morning, because I know that rough will be wet and thick in the morning, so hitting on the fairway is going to be the big key tomorrow.

Q.   Anything to attribute to the better driving of the golf ball this year?
KEVIN KISNER:   Just the work I've been doing with my teacher.   He's helped me a ton.   And just confidence.   You start seeing that ball where you're looking, you think you can drive it anywhere.   When it goes a little off, you don't know where it's going and it scares you to death out here.   Been a real confidence thing and I've really improved this year.

Q.   5‑under, 67, in the first round.   Are these the best scoring conditions you've seen all year?
KEVIN KISNER:   It's pretty incredible out here, no wind and perfect golf course.   This place is so pure.   It's always fun to play in these conditions.

Q.   Terrific up‑and‑down on the last hole, talk about it. 
KEVIN KISNER:   A little 9‑iron out in the middle of the fairway.   Wasn't my best, but it was good to finish off.   Make bogey there you wouldn't sleep as good.   Good way to finish off and get ready for tomorrow.

Q.   When conditions are this good, does it put pressure on you the next round to play just as well?
KEVIN KISNER:   You don't know what tomorrow is going to hold.   So if it gets windy around here, it gets really tricky, all these trees and hills.   We'll see what happens tomorrow, but keep making birdies and see what's happening. 

Q.   You're playing a lot of good golf lately and your schedule is fitted to it?
KEVIN KISNER:   Yeah, this is my stretch where I have to play well.   Starting at Hilton Head, I have to make all my hay through the middle of the summer.   So I'm doing it this year, and hopefully keep doing it for years to come.
