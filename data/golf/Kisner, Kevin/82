KEVIN KISNER: That's all you can do out here.  You keep it in the fairway, you can attack.  The course is receptive enough, you can make a lot of birdies.
Q. You had five bogeys and you are still 5-under today.  Tell us about the round.
KEVIN KISNER: I only made two bogeys today.  Five bogeys maybe for the tournament.  I missed a bunch of 15 footers from 10 to 14.  It was a solid day and glad to get up there in the mix.
Q. (No microphone)?
KEVIN KISNER: It all depends on what those guys do.  If they get to 12, 13-under, that's going to be a tall task.  I need the wind to stay up and the lead to not get too far away.
Q. (No microphone)?
KEVIN KISNER: I like 17 and 18, finally get to -- they played long today.  17 was back into the wind and played super long.  If I can get a 8 or 9 wedge in my hand, I feel pretty comfortable.
Q. (No microphone)?
KEVIN KISNER: I don't think so today with the wind blowing now.  Earlier I would have thought so.  Somebody gets hot, you never know.  You've got to be hitting your 7, 8-irons in there close to make birdies because there's no par-5s.
Q. (No microphone)?
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, well, 20 under won the last major.  I think you better attack it every time you get a chance on the PGA Tour.
Q. (No microphone)?
KEVIN KISNER: I'm pretty sure I can't get to 20.  Hopefully I can get to 10 or 11 and have a shot tomorrow.
