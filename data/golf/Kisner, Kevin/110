 Q.  Tough finish there, terrible lie there on the shot.  KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I thought it was good in the air.  Same club I hit in regulation short, and it went over the green this time.  Probably just a little pumped up.  But I'm glad to be in that position.   Q.  Another close call, but you're going to knock the door down at some time.  KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I keep knocking on it, I'll be there soon enough.  I keep playing well, I'll win one of them.   Q.  Just talk about your week as a whole.  KEVIN KISNER: Oh, it's just a good week to have the family here.  We got to do so many activities and hang out and enjoy each other, so good week.   Q.  You battled your way to get into the playoff today, came up a little bit short, but really an exceptional week for you.  KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, it was a good week.  You know, just to have a chance to win here, not having much success in previous years was a great opportunity.  I played well and thought 14 was the number the whole day.  It was, and a long shot, but I'm just happy I way I'm playing.
