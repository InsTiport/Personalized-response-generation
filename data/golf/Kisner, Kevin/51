 Q.  What was the difference for you today, all those birdies you played?  
KEVIN KISNER: I played more solid today.  It was tricky getting the right clubs.  Yesterday we hit the wrong club probably four or five times and today it worked out.  Built some confidence and try to win again tomorrow.   
 Q.  And tomorrow you control your own fate here.  That point and a half, you are in control, aren't you?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, looking forward to it.  We grew up together and played a lot of golf together.  So we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  So there could be a little something extra, dinner on the line?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe I need to pay him to win, right?
