 Q.  Back-to-back 68s.  You have to be really pleased with your position.  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, I feel good.  I've played solid both days.  Yesterday was obviously a little more difficult with the conditions.  Today I felt like I had a low one out there that I could have gotten in and just didn't quite finish it off.  But the golf course is in good shape, and it's going to be a whole new golf tournament starting tomorrow with the different conditions.   
 Q.  You haven't missed a cut this year, but the game has sort of been rounding into form.  I would imagine getting into a place like this and the demands that it has sets up well for you.  
KEVIN KISNER: I do.  Obviously I like to hit the driver in the fairway.  That's kind of my specialty.  It's a big key around here, and I'm able to hit driver on holes that other guys aren't.  Obviously I love the East Coast to get back on the right kind of grass and seeing the ball go in the hole.   
 Q.  That shot on 16 had to look pretty good to your eye.  
KEVIN KISNER: I'm still trying to figure out how that ended up there.  I couldn't get there, so I thought keeping it left was the play, and obviously that wasn't the play.  Anywhere over there would have been fine of that pin except where it ended up.   
 Q.  You talked about the conditions changing.  Given the way you played your first two rounds, is that a good thing for you or a bad thing, or how do you look at it?  
KEVIN KISNER: I think it's just going to even more prove to the guys that are hitting the ball the best.  Any time we get a north wind in the 15 to 20 miles an hour range and colder temperatures, your ball-striking has to be more precise, so I think that's going to be the biggest key is hitting the ball solid and hitting your shot shapes that you're trying to hit.   
 Q.  Why do you think this course suits you?  
KEVIN KISNER: Well, it's only suited me once really, twice now.  I like it.  It's one of those deals, if I'm driving it really well and feeling confident with the driver, I like it because I can attack more than some places where I'm pounding driver and still hitting 6-iron.  Like 10 is a great example, I can go ahead and hit driver down there and have sand wedge in compared to guys hitting hybrids or irons off that tee.  I feel good about that, and obviously I like the greens.  I don't know if I like them as much with a little bit of overseed on them, but I see the lines so much better on this type of grass.   
 Q.  What did playing so well here a few years back do for you?  
KEVIN KISNER: Just put a lot of money in my checking account.  Other than that, not much.  I mean, obviously it built confidence and I knew I could play well with these guys, but that was a year of a lot of playoffs and a lot of seconds.  I was happy at the end of that year to finally get a win, and that's all we're out here to do is to win trophies.   
 Q.  Did any one of those runner up finishes you had that year give you more confidence than the other or was it more of a building process?  
KEVIN KISNER: This one probably the most, this one is the most demanding the last three holes as far as shots you've got to hit.  Obviously standing up on 17 knowing you've got to make birdie to that pin is probably the most difficult of any of those, and being able to do that twice, that builds confidence.  I don't care if you win or lose.   
I would say here, obviously, not Greenbrier, I made about a 12 on that hole in the playoff.   
 Q.  You seem to be getting attention in the majors and big events like this more frequently.  
KEVIN KISNER: Well, I think it kind of goes hand in hand with your schedule.  When I first started getting into majors you didn't know if you were in or not.  Now you're in them all and you can start the year and your practice and preparation for that.  You always hear the bigger names talk about that and you can start trending your game and trying to hit certain shots for these types of golf courses.   
 Q.  When you came so close in '13 did that change the way you felt about this place?  
KEVIN KISNER: I believe that was my first year, so I didn't really even know about the place.  I mean, obviously I'd come down here in the winter with friends, but it was nothing like it was in May.  It's closer to that now than it was that year.  No real change.   
 Q.  When you first came did you think that this was a place you would play well at, or did that change --  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, obviously I was very familiar with the grass, which is always helpful, and it's not overly long.  I'm not hitting 4-irons into all these par-4s into these sections.  That seems to be the new trend on the PGA TOUR.  I'm hitting -- you drive it well, you can hit a lot of 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-irons into these holes, which I feel way more comfortable with.
