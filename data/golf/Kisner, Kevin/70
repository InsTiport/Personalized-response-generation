 Q.  Nice to finish with a birdie.  Just talk a little bit about your round.  
KEVIN KISNER: You know, didn't get off to a great start, but then I hit a lot of great shots coming in.   
It's just so brutal getting the clubs right, and we just never got it really to close any putts.   
 Q.  Other players are talking about the heat.  What impact did that have on you today?  
KEVIN KISNER: Didn't bother me.  I'm fine with it.  I love it.
