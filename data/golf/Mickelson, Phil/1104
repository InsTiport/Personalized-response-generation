Q.
Do they need to move this thing over to the Island Course?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know what to say.  It's a tough course for me to play well on, mainly because I don't read the greens very well.

But it's a wonderful event.  I'm just sorry I didn't play better.
Q.  Care to make a prediction for the weekend?  You're pretty good at those.
PHIL MICKELSON:  A prediction?  That's tough.  I have no idea who's going to win.  But I think it's going to be interesting because we've got so many guys fighting to keep their card and make it a certain way up on the Money List, so it'll be an interesting weekend.
Q.  What is it about the greens that are giving you trouble?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I just don't read them well.  I don't know what to say.  I've never read Bermuda that well.

When I won the NCAA at the Island Course they were a reasonable speed, but now they're so fast you have to read them perfectly to get them to go in, and I'm just not seeing it.
Q.  Are you going to keep this tournament on your schedule next year?
PHIL MICKELSON:  That's hard to say.  I'm looking at how I want my schedule to go.  I've noticed in the past few years after the PGA I really haven't played well.  I seems like I play hard in a lot of events up until the PGA, and then after that I just don't seem to play that well, so I might have to look at doing something different next year.
Q.  Some suggest that golf is too long a season.  I know you're independent contractors and you can see it, but after the PGA you can even see it in galleries.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, after the fourth major the season does wear on a little bit, and I think a lot of guys are tired.  But because so many guys are fighting to keep their card, I don't know if anything will change, not that I would want it to, but it just seems like after the PGA the year kind of ends.
