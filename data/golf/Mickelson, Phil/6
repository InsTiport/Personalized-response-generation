Q:   I know youre disappointed in what happened here at Winged Foot. Was it more your game or just battling Winged Foot?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I enjoyed the week and I enjoyed the challenge that this golf course provides. I think its always one of the hardest tests that we play but one of the most fun challenges because of the gosh, the character of the course all throughout, from shot-making to putting and short game. I think its a terrific place to play golf and Im appreciative of the opportunity to have been able compete here and Im disappointed I didnt play better.
Q:   What is your plan moving forward now, Phil?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Im going to head home and take a few weeks off and go from there.
Q:   Will you maybe play some more Champions Tour events?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I dont know yet.
Q:   Did it kind of spiral on you yesterday, getting on a bad track with the bogeys that you made?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I find that Ive been playing very well at home, and I get out here where the penalty for a mis-hit is severe, and I find myself getting a little tight and a little steer-y, and playing some of my worst golf. And thats something Ive got to work on and fix. When I go back home, I dont have the stress and I seem to play just fine, but Ive got to be able to bring it out here under these conditions.
Q:   Were you at all more free today with it?
PHIL MICKELSON:   So-so. I played OK for a while and then let it go.
Q:   How important was it for you to come back here and compete, 14 years on from 2006? What are your feelings about this return?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Its fun for me to return, its fun for me to come back here. I love the people here and Im sorry they werent able to come out to the tournament. But I think its one of the best golf courses that we play and play majors on and it was fun for me to have to play and compete here one more time.
Q:   Have you given any thought to whether this might be your final U.S. Open?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I dont know.
