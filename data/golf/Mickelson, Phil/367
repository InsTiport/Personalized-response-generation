Q.   Chance to stay the weekend? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, no.   It will be‑‑ even has a chance but could go to 1‑under.   No, I won't make the cut. 

Q.   Did you feel on that last chip that you needed to hole it? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   You know, I gave it a try.   I knew I had to make it.   I had a good chance on 8 from about eight, ten feet and missed it.   I had a hard time making birdies today.   I don't know what it was.   When I hit a reasonable shot, I missed the putt, and I don't know, I just had a hard time making birdies. 
Golf course is in great shape though and it's a great tournament. 

Q.   Take anything out of the two days? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I drove the ball well.   I mean, I hit 75 percent of my fairways.   That's a good thing for me.   I'm starting to drive the ball well.   What I normally do well on my iron play was distance control was off, it just wasn't sharp, and I didn't putt as well as I had expected.   I made‑‑ I didn't put bad but I didn't putt great. 

Q.   But you're playing Monday‑‑
PHIL MICKELSON:   Planning on it, yeah. 

Q.   How does it change what you do the next couple days, obviously not playing here?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm not sure.   I just got done so I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
