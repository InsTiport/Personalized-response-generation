  PHIL MICKELSON:   I shot even par.   It could have been better but it could have been a lot worse, and I'll certainly take it. 

Q.   Any idea just from yesterday to today what exactly changed in your swing. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was just a fraction off, because I hit the ball pretty solid yesterday.   I felt like I was on the right track, and when I came out this morning, it was a little bit off.   I was hitting some pull looks, I was hitting some block cuts, and so I put myself in some not great spots off the tee. 
Had to fight to make pars, and pretty fortunate I think to shoot even par.   Now, I let a few shots go there that probably could have got me to 2‑ or 3‑under, but I didn't have a round where I could have gone really low.   Fighting to keep the round par. 

Q.   What adjustments are you looking to make? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's just a fraction off.   I started the last seven or eight holes to hit it pretty good.   I had a slight movement off the ball, which put me in a bad position at the top of my swing, and I wasn't able to recover. 
I hit a lot of bad shots early on but the last seven or eight holes, I looked liked I was hitting it pretty good.   If I can do that tomorrow and if I can hit it like I did the last seven or eight, I should hopefully be able to run and make some birdies and play more aggressive.

Q.   What changed off 10 today? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I hit driver and that was actually my best drive because it was exactly where I was trying to hit it which is as far left as you can possibly go to pin‑high, and the reason is, the further left you go, the more you have a softer handle to that pin.   If you get it too close to the green, if you're a little bit short or a little bit long, you don't really have an angle to get to the pin.   Hit a good shot, a good chip up to eight feet and made it.
It was freezing cold at seven in the morning and the only way to play the hole is to get it past pin‑high, the green is so first and has pitched so much and has shrunk over the years that trying to hit a wedge there is very unrealistic.   It hits on the downslope and it goes in the bunker.   So you know, even if you flew an 80‑yard shot exactly where you wanted to, getting it to stay on the green‑‑

Q.   Would 10 be any better, if they worked with it more, could it be a better hole than it already is? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I think it was ten years ago, but over time, greens are going to shrink, kikuyu is going to keep in.   As we have got firmer greens, it's become a hole that you used to try to make a three on and you're pretty happy today to make a four.
I got lucky today in the sense that I hit a perfect chip shot and made a great putt but this hole is going to play over par.   It's very difficult to make threes there right now. 

Q.   On 11, you turned and watched Westwood play his shot; is that one hole you can sit and watch out of curiosity how guys play and what they do?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I always enjoy watching him chip around the greens, too, though.
