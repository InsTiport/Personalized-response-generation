 Q.  Looks like you're going to come up a little short.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Unfortunate.  I didn't score the best today.  I had a little rough front-9.  But had that chip on 18 gone in it would have been enough.  I missed by a shot.   
It's disappointing but I like the fact that I'm starting to play well.  I look forward to staying sharp this week for the Presidents Cup.  I'll play the following week in Napa.  Looks like I'm probably going to go to China, too.  I feel like I'm playing well --   
 Q.  How would you assess this season overall?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It's been interesting, yeah, probably just interesting.  I had a very consistent solid year until I got to the British and but yet I didn't have very high finishes.   
I feel like I'm finally starting to play well enough to get in contention and do well.  I want to add a few events.   
 Q.  Your hand?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Just like tape for some inflammation.  It's fine.   
 Q.  You saw Sergio's ball there in the stream.  Knowing your mentality, I think almost maybe you go up there and try to hit, probably want to hit that shot off the rocks.  
 What were you thinking in terms of him?   
PHIL MICKELSON: I was thinking this is what my playing partners go through most of the time.  I was just on other end of it.  I've been on his side of it a lot.   
 Q.  Was it hard to wait that long and play?  
PHIL MICKELSON: No.  I needed that extra 38 minutes to read that putt (laughter).
