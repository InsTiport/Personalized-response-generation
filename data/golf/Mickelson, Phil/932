  Q. Obvious disappointment for you but your thoughts?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Greg played very solid golf and I played very erratic golf. I made birdies and bogeys and he just played steady with solid pars and ultimately that won out in the play-off because he was just much more consistent. I really struggled off the tee and the back nine was a fight for me.   
  
  Q. Did your struggles on the tee come into your mind as you stood on the 18th tee for the play-off?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I just tried to make a good swing and blocked it left. I hit a good shot out off the swamp to have a chance but I hit the third shot way too hard. But, again, when Greg plays solid like that and hits fairways and greens - not only does he deserve to win but he makes himself very tough to beat.   
  
  Q. Overall it has been a great tournament?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I really enjoyed playing this tournament. It's such a well run event and the golf course is wonderful and Barclays is a great sponsor and I really enjoyed my stay here.   
  
  Q. The confidence is up for next week now?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I am looking forward to playing the British Open. I enjoy playing in Scotland and after spending a few days in Carnoustie and seeing that it is setup wonderfully I am really looking forward to playing there.
