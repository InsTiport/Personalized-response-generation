 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I thought they were perfect.   I thought it was a great day for the guys that are playing well to separate themselves.   There were under par scores, there was, you could get into the 60s, if you played well.   Although this wind was difficult, you could still ‑‑ the greens were receptive, if you hit a good shot and judged the wind well, you would be rewarded with a good birdie opportunity.   I thought that it was a perfect day for the guys that are playing well to separate themselves and it looks like they are.   
   
 Q.   Go low on the weekend you can still be right in there.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I think so.   You're never out on this tournament.   You just never know what's going to happen.   
I've got a little bit of work to do, it doesn't feel far off.   My putter is very close.   I've hit a lot of good putts that have not gone in that have come very close the first two days.   If I can get a couple to fall and hit a few more good shots, I think that I have something in the mid 60s, which I will need tomorrow to get back in it.  
   
 Q.   You said at 9 that it kind of shook you what happened at 9.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah.   I don't know, I don't know what the deal was.   That hole, I have really struggled on in the past with a wedge in there.   I had a gap wedge, I drove it down to the bottom of the hill there, gap wedge to that back pin.   And I hit just an awful shot in the bunker.   And then I had a pretty easy bunker shot.   It was on an upslope, good lie, and I caught it half spin, 15, 18 feet long.   
So I don't know what happened there, but it threw me and it carried over to the next shot, because I hit an awful shot at 10.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the club at 12.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it was a bad swing.   Certainly the wind came up, but it was a terrible swing.   If I drove that in the middle of the green it would have been fine.   
   
 Q.   What was the club?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Nine.  
   
 Q.   When you say you were shook by that, do you lose a little focus on the next shot, is that what we're talking about?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know.   Maybe.   That hole's frustrated me because it shows where I've hit poor iron shots in after good drives and I'm thinking birdie and I walk away with bogey.  
   
 Q.   Somebody said that the hole locations seemed a little angry.   Were they particularly hard?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I didn't find that to be the case, because I felt like the low pin on 2 gave us a birdie chance.   
Low pin on 4 gave us a birdie chance.   
I thought that that right pin on 7 was, you're going to have 15, 18 feet if you just hit a halfway decent shot.   
That pin on 8, that back right pin has been softened a couple years ago and so you can make birdie there.   
13's pretty easy birdie pin.   
But 18's a birdie pin.   
But it's kind of the usual.   Six birdie pins, six par pins, and six that you can, but you got to hit really good shots.  
   
 Q.   After 12 did you, like on 9, were you a little disheartened?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I was disappointed.   After I doubled 12, I came back with a birdie, I was within ‑‑ I think I was only 1‑over for the Tournament at the time.   So I could have gotten right back to even or 1‑under coming in.   And I had a good drive on 14, I hit a gap wedge again short and made double or I made bogey.   
I made a lot of mistakes today.   I made a lot of poor mistakes that I just can't do around here.   
   
 Q.   Sounds like you drove the ball well, so you like the combination on the two whatever you want to call them?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I'm not disappointed with that, I've given myself good chances.   But it doesn't feel far off.   I've got to shoot something really low.
