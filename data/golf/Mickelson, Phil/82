Q. You must be disappointed, missing the cut for the weekend.
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I would have liked to have made the cut.  I think that Gullane is such a great way to get ready for next week at Carnoustie.  The course is firm and fast, just like Carnoustie is.  I think it's a great opportunity to get your game sharp in links-style golf.
I would have liked to have played two more days.  Just didn't make some putts there on the back nine.  I had some chances and just didn't get it going.  I'll head over to Carnoustie and try to make it a positive and have a few extra rounds over there.
Q. How is your head now going into Carnoustie next week after a difficult month for you?
PHIL MICKELSON: You know, I had a really good first three or four months to the year.  I was playing really well.  I'm a little bit off, so I have a little bit of work to do.
Q. You head to Carnoustie and just do some practise?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'll head over sometime tomorrow.  I may practise a little bit here or head over there, I'm not quite sure but I'll be there for the weekend.
Q. What conditions are you looking for at Carnoustie next week?
PHIL MICKELSON: I had a pretty good idea of how it's going to play when I spent time there on Tuesday and Wednesday, and I expect it to be very firm and fast.  There's just a little chance of rain and that means that there's going to be a lot of long irons off the tees.  There won't be too many drivers, but there are some opportunities to hit driver, so we'll see.
Q. I think the wind is set to pick up Wednesday, Thursday, Friday next week.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I would actually enjoy that because I've kind of spent time getting the ball on the ground -- really working on getting the ball on the ground quicker and it would be helpful if it got really windy and a little bit more difficult.
