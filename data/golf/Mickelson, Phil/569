   PHIL MICKELSON: It was a beautiful day. It was a beautiful day here in Atlanta and we had some great weather and I played well, but need to go a little bit lower tomorrow. 

 Q. What was working for you today that maybe hasn't been the past couple days? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, the past couple days, I shot a couple under, right around par. I just haven't really lit it up yet. But I feel like it's right there. I mean, I feel like if I can just get a couple of putts on the greens -- and the greens are just beautiful, they're spectacular, if I can get a few to go, I can make a run at the lead tomorrow. 

 Q. Things seemed to be coming together toward the end of the round today. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: You know, I shot a few under and I played well. Toward the end I made a couple of 6-, 8-footers that were helpful, but I left a few out there on the greens the first eight holes for sure. I at least made a bit of a comeback there at the end.

 Q. Butch and I were sitting watching the frustration on your face. How hard is it to bear when you feel as if you've got everything right and it doesn't work?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's kind of worn on me because the last -- for some time now, I feel like I've been striking the ball well, just haven't been getting the scores out of it. 
 The last 11 holes I made a couple of putts and ended up shooting under par to at least get myself in position where if I can turn it around tomorrow and get a few of those putts to go, I can make a run at the leaders.

 Q. You went really low when you won here the last time. Is that on your mind?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Absolutely, yeah. I feel like the first three rounds I had three possibilities of 63, 64, that I turned into 68, 69. If I can just not do that and keep it where I feel the round should be, I think I can make a run tomorrow.

 Q. We've noticed here that every single player and especially yourself, there's a long lin of fans up there every day and you spend a lot of time with them. How important is that part of the game to you?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I think that as a player we want to come out and compete and not have distractions, so to not sign before the round or during the round is probably the best way to go, but you have to set aside 10, 15, 20 minutes, whatever it was, after the round, because it's these people here that allow us to play golf for a living, and we need to show that appreciation.
