 Q.  On his round today. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  Even after I made triple on No. 1 I felt like if I could get back to even by the turn I had a chance.  When it's playing hard and fast like this, it sets up perfectly for guys like that (Zach Johnson, David Toms, Jerry Kelly.) 

 I didn't feel like I played that well, or certainly not like I wanted.  I'll take a couple of weeks off and get ready for the TPC and for the U.S. Open.
