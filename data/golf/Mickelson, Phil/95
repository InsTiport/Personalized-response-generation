Q. Today seemed to be a little better than yesterday?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was better but it's never easy to be out here knowing what you're missing out on with that back nine here Sunday at the Masters and not having a chance, it's difficult because you know what you're missing out on and you know what special things happen on that back nine, how fun it is to be a part of it, be in the mix. But I went out and had a great day playing with Chez. We had fun, I hit some good shots and it was an okay way to finish. 

Q. What was the difference in the just the striking ability today?
PHIL MICKELSON: I hit one good shot this whole week, it was the 7‑iron on 17, which went exactly as I had wanted to. So I was just a little bit off and I'll take a week or two off and I'll regroup and get back it. But I've been very consistent this year, especially off the tee, and then last week and this week I've hit some really big misses, which I haven't been doing this year, I haven't had big numbers this year, and then these last two weeks I've had a lot of big numbers. So I'll have to get that worked out.

Q. Talk about the birdie streak early. 
PHIL MICKELSON: I basically just made some putts. It wasn't like I hit it close, I got up‑and‑down out of the front bunker on 2 making a 10‑footer and I made a kind of a curling 12‑footer on 3 and a 30‑footer on 4. So it's not like I was knocking down the stick, it's just tough to birdie those holes, but there are a lot of birdie opportunities and the ones that we, you can birdie, like 7 and 8, with those pins, I didn't, I actually bogeyed 8. But there are a lot of opportunities on the back nine and the course is soft, like the greens are, with the rain, I think it's a little bit softer so you can get after it. I think we're going to see some low scores today, especially if the wind kind of calms down like it's supposed to.

Q. Looking ahead what does Shinnecock bring up in your mind and your memory and your hope?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well the difficult thing for me is I continue to put, I put a little bit too much pressure on myself in the Majors now because I know that I don't have a ton of time to win them, especially U.S. Opens, but these next two U.S. Opens, Shinnecock and Pebble Beach give me two really good opportunities. So I need to keep my game, get my game sharp, but I really need to be on those weeks and in the past I've been on at Shinnecock and I'm hopeful to do it again.

Q. Have you been back there since the 2004 Open at all?
PHIL MICKELSON: No, they keep changing it up, I heard they widened the fairways, tightened the fairways, I'll let it kind of settle in and I'll go in a few weeks beforehand. I have pretty extensive notes on the greens from years pass, but it's going to be a very interesting week because historically the USGA hasn't done their best on setting that thing up in the past and I hope that they let the superintendent there do his thing and not interfere, because he knows what he's doing.

Q. We haven't had a career Grand Slam completed for awhile. We could have three this year. Potentially Rory tonight obviously. Does that make a difference for your bid or is that just a strange coincidence that we could have three this year?
PHIL MICKELSON: I think that it would be really cool if we were able ‑‑ any of us or all ‑‑ were able to do it. I think that it's one of those career milestones that set you apart from all players, that shows that you're a complete me player, and if Rory or Jordan were able to do it ‑‑ and they will eventually, if it's this year or not, they will do it, they have got a lot of time. They won their Majors very early in their career. I didn't start until I was 33 and they're not even close to that. So they will get it done. But I need to get it done soon.
