  PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a challenging test.   I thought the great thing was how great the greens were.   They were in fabulous shape.   They putted very true.   And I know that there were some question marks when they were being redone, but they really turned out fabulous and putted extremely well for all the players throughout the week.   
   
 Q.   Did the change in weather for the last day‑‑ it's been unseasonably worm the first three days, and to turn colder.   How much of a difference did that make in the way the course played?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Surprisingly, it didn't really change it too much because it was firm regardless, whether there was moisture or not, you were still bouncing balls up.   So it really didn't, I think, affect the play the way other variables did, such as pin placements, tee boxes, things like that.  
   
 Q.   Were you able to balance trying to get in a good position versus what the course was giving you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I wasn't, because I didn't play well.   But I thought it was‑‑ if you played anything less than perfect golf it was extremely penalizing, and I played far from perfect.  
   
 Q.   You didn't get hurt or anything out there today, did you?   Somebody brought that up earlier.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, I'm fine.   I'm fine.
