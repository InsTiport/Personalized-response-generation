 Q. How were the weather conditions out there?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, they were tough until it got called here, until it got suspended. 

 Q. How did it affect your round?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, with winds this strong, you know, your putts from three feet are greatly affected, not to mention trying to make 8-, 10- or 12-footers from crosswinds. It's very difficult. The balls are blowing a little bit, and you can't play the ball in the air. It's got to be along the ground because once it gets in the air, it just keeps going off line. It's very difficult. Every hole is tough par, I think, in these conditions.

 Q. Do you think if it had been called earlier --
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know what it's like out there now. It didn't move on the green for us. I've played in the past where it has. I played one round in '03 in Sandwich, it moved six times on me on the putting green as I was addressing it. Twice I had actually put the club behind it and was penalized both times. I have seen it where it's been unplayable, and it very well may be now. It's okay when we played, just hard.

 Q. Considering the conditions that you had yesterday and today, how do you feel about where you're at? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm frustrated, because I love this golf course and this tournament, and I felt I was playing well coming in. I didn't play well the first two days, but I felt I was playing well after some good practise sessions. And I didn't play well the first two days, and I've gotten kind of an unfortunate draw, but if I could have played like Retief or -- 5-, 6-under par, be right there, I think a lot can happen on the weekend. But for me now I've got to go out and shoot a low round tomorrow, and I don't know if the conditions will be conducive to that, but hopefully they will be. 

 Q. You said on TV yesterday that you kind of let the bad draw get to you a little bit, affect you. Given all your experience and everything you've been through, was that something that you maybe should have tried to overcome, or is that easier said than done when it's like this?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, what I meant by that is a good round in the morning was probably 6-under par, and when we teed off, a good round was probably 2- or 3-under par, and I was still trying to think 6-under par, and I had to adjust to what a good round was under the conditions I was facing, and I just kept trying to kind of press the issue.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: I've had a few. I've had a few that probably could have gone but didn't.

 Q. Was that a line-of-sight thing on 12?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it was a line-of-sight for the shot I was going to hit, which was going to be up on the other green, I think it was 6. I was going to try to hit it on 6 green, and it was in my way of that shot. 

 Q. Tomorrow do you basically throw caution to the wind or still try to --
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I mean, it just depends on the condition. I'm going to be going off early, so hopefully it'll be calm. 

 Q. There wasn't a point during your round where you thought play should have been suspended?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I just thought it was hard. 

 Q. What positive thoughts do you have going into tomorrow? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, hopefully I'll make the cut. Right now I plan on -- right now I'm inside the cut line. But if the winds calm down and they get back out and play or they don't play again until tomorrow, there's a good chance it may not make it. There will be a lot more birdies out there.

 Q. With regard to the bad draw, is what just happened here almost like strike 3?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm happy for those guys. That's great. (Laughter.)
