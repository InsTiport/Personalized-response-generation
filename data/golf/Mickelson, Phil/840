  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, talk about my round. It's not a fun topic of conversation. But it was tough for everybody. When I was 6-over through six, I didn't think it was that bad a start relative to what the field would do. I thought most guys would be about 2-, 3-, 4-over through six holes.  
 As I look up now, the back nine played a lot easier for me without the rain. The wind came, softened a little bit, so the back wasn't nearly as tough as the front. I think that when I was playing, I thought anything in the 70s would be a pretty good score, and I was able to do that. But I don't think it's going to hold up as well as I thought.  
  
  Q. Just how brutal was it out there?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know how to describe it. You try to go play in it and you get an idea, but it was very difficult.  
  
  Q. Ten years ago on that Friday, can you compare it to that at all?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't recall how strong the winds were. I know they were touching 50 so it was a tough day. But for whatever reason the rain made it play so much more difficult, whether it was grips or the way it affected the ball more. I'm not sure. But when the rain stopped it played a lot easier.  
  
  Q. On your triple you just couldn't find the ball?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Lost it, yeah. I lost my second shot. But that's -- with the wind and the rain, it grabs it and takes it more off-line.  
  
  Q. You said you don't think this is going to stand up as well as you previously thought. Where do you think it's going to end up?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I don't think anybody will shoot even. If that's the case, if the scores hold up, I'm only eight shots back with three rounds to go, so just a good solid round will get me right back in it. I really thought that would be right around the middle of the field, now it's going to be in the bottom third.  
  
  Q. Puts pressure on you, doesn't it?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Obviously when you shoot 79 you're going to have to come back with something pretty cool to get back in it.
