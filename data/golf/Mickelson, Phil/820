  Q. Phil, 2-under, just get some comments on the day if we can.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: The greens were just perfect. You just felt like you could really make a lot of putts. And with them being soft, we were able to get the ball close, so you saw a lot of low scores. It was hard to go really low because of the length of the course, but it was in beautiful shape, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow's 36-hole day.  
  
  Q. You've got to feel good getting it back going the right direction after last week.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's good to get off to a good start, and I felt like it could have been a really low round, but I'll take 2-under and look forward to getting in a good rhythm tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What is the key on a 36-hole day?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Just finding a good rhythm for the day. There's going to be a lot of good shots, a lot of bad shots throughout the day, but just try to find a good pace, good rhythm.
