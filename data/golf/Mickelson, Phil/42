 Q.  I know you addressed this yesterday, but can you talk about what they did about the golf course this week.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's perfect.  It's a perfect hard test.  When you struggle a little bit or if you pull shots like I did it's very penalizing.  And the guys that are playing well it gives them a chance to separate and make some birdies and reward great shots.  It was perfectly done and I'm just so excited to see -- to go watch our national championship.   
 Q.  You played with the people's champ out there with all the singing.  Does that take a little of edge off not taking home the trophy?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Dealing with losing in this game is a huge thing because even the best -- the greatest winners win such a small percentage of the time.  But I have had so many special moments here at Pebble Beach that I can't help but play here and not be thankful and appreciative and grateful for all the gifts that I've been given and to be able to play and compete in this event.  This was my first event as a pro, 1992, here.  Even though I didn't play my best this week it is a special place and so fun to be a part of it.   
 Q.  How many birthday songs did you get?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Decent amount.  It's pretty cool.  The people here have been so nice to me and I'm very thankful.   
 Q.  From Pebble Beach to Portrush in Northern Ireland.  How much are you looking forward to getting there and what memories do you have of playing the course with your father?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I played Portrush one time with my dad and it was a special, fun golf course.  It's been a while so I don't remember a lot of the details and subtleties of it.  It's a beautiful place.  Ireland is just a beautiful place.  And I'm looking forward to getting back and participating and being a part of it.   
 Q.  Is there a level of disappointment, I think you said at Memorial you only feel like you've got a couple more cracks at this?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I don't know what else to say.  It's not like I'm going to stop trying.  I enjoy the challenge.  But I thought this was a really good chance for me.  I just didn't -- I didn't putt my best, I didn't chip my best.  I actually played okay tee to green.  I hit a lot of good shots.  And my short game was not what it usually is and hasn't been this year.  So I'm going to work on that a little bit.  I feel like my game has been coming around and I want to finish off this summer.
