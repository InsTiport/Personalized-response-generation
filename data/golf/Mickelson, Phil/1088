PHIL MICKELSON:  Certainly any miss that I had today was magnified by David's round of 7 under par.  But again, I don't know exactly where I was, 3 , 4 , 5 under, and in stroke play it would be okay.  The first couple of rounds, played pretty good, and I'll be right there.  But the way this one is, you run into a guy like David Toms, if you don't have all your best game, you're going to get beat, and that's what happened.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
PHIL MICKELSON:  I told him I love playing with him, a lot more than I like playing against him.  I like teaming up with him in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was.  I three putted 18, knew it was quick, knew the pin was on the sidehill and it was going to be tough to stop it, and I still couldn't get it to stop within five feet.  I three putted 12.  He birdied 10 and 11.

You're going to have that stuff.  If I was only 2 down it would have been    that's two holes right there, if I don't three putt 9 and 12, I'm still in the match, only 1 down with a couple to go.  Those mistakes certainly made the difference.
Q.  You can shoot well in match play but still
PHIL MICKELSON:  That's the beauty of it as well as the negative of it.  It makes it tough.  As I've said before, my two wins at AT&T and Phoenix the last couple of weeks would not have been wins in this format because I had two rounds of 73.  I would have been knocked out twice.  It's interesting.  It makes it fun, though.
Q.  Did you look at the fact that some of the top seeds have lost, Tiger lost and Vijay lost?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No.
