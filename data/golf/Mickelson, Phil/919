 Q.  Can you comment on your round today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I shot 1-under today.  I needed to go a little bit lower but maybe a good round tomorrow will give me a chance on Sunday.  That's the goal, just to get in position for Sunday. 

 Q.  Interesting 10th hole you had today, can you just take us through that? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, just trying to drive it in front of the bunkers there and pulled it.  Had a tough shot through the trees and hopped it through the rough just perfectly on the green about 15 feet and I thought I made the putt. 

 Q.  Did you hear about what happened off the 11th -- (missing the green). 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, that's kind of the place to miss it.  You don't want to go left over there.  A lot of balls go over there. 

 Q.  (About putting today.) 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I didn't putt the best but have a good chance hopefully tomorrow to get it going. 

 Q.  (Do you spend much time practicing shots like that from out of the rough)? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Just playing, you come up with shots like that.  We've practiced it a number of times but it's mostly on the golf course, it's not like you do it on the range. 

 Q.  How do you like where you stand going into the weekend? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I would have liked to have been more under par because when K.J. gets it going, he's got the ability to keep going so he's going to be tough to catch. 
 But a good round tomorrow, maybe I'll have a chance on Sunday. 

 Q.  Did you hear about the grips he uses on his putter he ordered from an informercial two years ago? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No. 

 Q.  Have you ever heard of anyone doing that? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's a little rare but it seems to be working. 

 Q.  (What will you need to do for the weekend)? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, the lower the scores, the better, that's kind of all you need to know. 

 Q.  So what's your sense of how this golf course is playing, is this just a reflection of the rain or is the course just so short -- 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't feel like it's playing that short really.  The ball is not running very much in the fairway so it's not like it's playing very short. 

 Q.  But do you think the lower scores so far, are they a reflection of it being soft? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I wouldn't say that -- we're okay out here.  It's not that bad.  I think it being soft has made it tougher because the pins are always on high spots.  It seems like balls are being pulled away from the hole on every single green.  So I think that's kept the scores from being really low, and I just think that the guys out here are decent. 
 But what's happened is the governing bodies have kind of embarrassed us throughout the year with all of the tournaments and the way they have set it up.  So it looks as though when we reach double digits under par, it's an oddity. 

 Q.  Another day out here with these New York fans; what did you think of it today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I love it out here, I really do.  I enjoy playing out here.  I think it's fun.  I always hear some funny comments.  It keeps me chuckling throughout the round.  It's been fun coming here. 

 Q.  What was the funniest one today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably a couple I shouldn't repeat, but they are very creative.
