Q.   I saw a lot of good shots out there from you today.   I guess you also want a little bit more consistency. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I'm piecing it together.   My irons are really good.   I feel really good with my irons.   I've got good distance control, control with my misses.   They're about as good as they've been and about as good as I can expect, and my putting was much better.   My short game needs some work.   I've been spending so much time on long game, my short game needs some work.   I didn't get up‑and‑down any of the times I missed the green. 
And obviously my driver.   I've got to spend some time now with my driver and 3‑wood getting it in play because that was horrific. 

Q.   Tell me about the new putter. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   This is something that we've been working on at Odyssey.   It's a takeoff on the No.9, but it's got a low‑profile heel and a raised toe that gives it kind of a hook roll.   I probably should have gone to it yesterday because it just rolls off the face like magic, and it has this great track.   I was making a lot more 15‑ to 30‑footers because it was holding such a tight roll.   But I just didn't want to change from my blade because that's kind of been my identity, but I feel really good with this thing, and I'll probably go back and forth.   This is something we've been working on for a while, and it just is fabulous.

Q.   We've seen you do this before, put one putter in for one round and then go back.   Is the new one in for Saturday? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it just has a really good flow to it where it squares up.   It releases.   It closes, so I don't have the fear of blocking it, and I just kind of give it like a hook roll.   I've been really excited about it.
