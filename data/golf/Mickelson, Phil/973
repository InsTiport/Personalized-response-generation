Q.  How excited are you to be going out tomorrow?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'm excited to play with Chris DiMarco.  We played well together and really enjoyed being paired together.  We have a very difficult match tomorrow, not just because Lee and Darren are such incredibly talented players, but because of the emotions that will be involved in the match, as well.
