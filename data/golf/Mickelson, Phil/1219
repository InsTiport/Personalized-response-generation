Q.  The incident at 16 could you walk us through that, please?

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, on 16, I hit the ball in the left trees and the ball didn't have my usual markings.  I had gotten a new ball and it just wasn't marked.  So when I went to identify it, I was not able to do so.  And fortunately, television was there, and was able to help out.  Unfortunately, when I marked it to identify it, I did not  -- I vocalized my intentions, but I didn't vocalize them towards Jim, my playing partner, to observe me lifting.  So  I got another penalty; so I ended up with 7 there as it is.  So it turned out the same. 

Q.  Did you know what number the ball was? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, yeah.  I only have 1's this week, so it's got to be a Titleist 1. 

Q.  Now that you find yourself about six shots off the pace, you've said that this course is one that you find it easy to be patient on.  Is your patience going to be tested tomorrow?

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I've got to shoot low.  I've got to shoot 7- , 8- , 9-under par to have a chance.  It's doable.  I didn't score very well today.  I'm going to have a tough time.  I'm going to have to fix it tonight or tomorrow morning and try to turn it around for tomorrow. 

Q.  Rain is in the forecast.  Will softer greens help you shoot a low number tomorrow? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know if it will matter either way.
