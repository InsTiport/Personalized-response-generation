  Q. Talk about your round today.  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I've been driving it really well. I've been very happy with that.   
 Today my swing got just a little long and loose. I didn't leave myself in good positions often enough. I wanted to work on it on the range, have it in my head overnight so I knew what to work on first thing tomorrow.   
 13 was a good break, but as often happens, the ball is playable over there, might not look like it over there, but it is.   
 I went with one driver today, because I thought the wind would be into us on 4 and I needed 3-iron. On 15, I needed 3-iron.   
 I'm not really sure which drivers I'll be using, depends day by day.   
 I made a good birdie on 14, carved a 3-iron 175 yards on 14, worked out pretty nicely.
