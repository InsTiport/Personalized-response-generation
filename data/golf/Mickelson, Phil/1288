Q.  Can you talk about the tournament and how it's impacted you with Player-of-the-Year and all?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I needed to finish third or higher for the money lead, to stay on top of the money list.  And I didn't do it, so it was a little disappointing, because I was first or second pretty much all year, turned up second.  It was a little disappointing, but Tom played great this week.  He ran away with the tournament and he deserves it, he's had a great year. 
 

Q.  Who do you feel should be Player-of-the-Year, who is your front runner?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I think if I try -- in an unbiased way I think three people have a good shot with really good years.  I feel like I've had a good year.  I was very pleased with the four wins. I feel Tom Lehman had a good year, he's going to end up on top of the money list and on top of the scoring average and he also won a major.  And Mark Brooks had a phenomenal year, winning three tournaments and one of them was a major.  I think he finished third on the money list.  So I think the top three there have -- I think it's going to be close.  I really couldn't tell you who's going to do it. 
 

Q.  Quick question about the off season.  A lot of guys have plans for either rehab or things like that, and you've got special things coming up?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm taking the next two months off from the game to do a lot of other things.  I'm really excited about getting married, we're going to do that here in a few weeks.  And we just purchased a house that should be completed about the same time, so we'll be moving in as well.  I've got three weeks set aside where I'm going to get my instrument rating for my pilot's license, so hopefully I'll be able to fly to a few more tournaments.
