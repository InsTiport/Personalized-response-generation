Q.   Yesterday you said the timing was a little off.   How about today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Today I hit the ball really well.   I hit a lot of good shots, and although I shot 5‑under and I'm pleased with the round and so forth, I left probably five, six, seven shots on the greens that could have gone.   As good as these greens are, you expect to make a lot of these 8‑ and 12‑footers and I left some out there.
I made one on the last, so I have a good taste heading into the weekend, and see if I can get it all together because I feel like I'm really close to a really hot round.

Q.   You're right there heading into Saturday, don't you think?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, yeah, no question.   I'm five, six back.   I'm not sure what's leading right now.   I put myself in a good position for a good, hot round.   That good, hot round could have been today very easily, and hopefully I'll get it all together for tomorrow. 

Q.   And lastly, the putting stroke, especially on the short putts, looks fantastic.   You've got to feel good about that. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it really is.   I have a lot less stress.   The ball starts on line and a lot softer.   The face is square throughout the entire stroke.   There's no opening or closing, so consequently I hit them a lot on line.   I'll have to get a little bit better touch.   I had a good one on the last hole, but I'll have to get a little better touch from 8 to 15 feet because that's where you can really get them going on these greens.   They're just perfect.
