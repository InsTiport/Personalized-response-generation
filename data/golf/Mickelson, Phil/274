 Q.   You always talk about momentum.   Seven birdies out there today but I think there were three par saves that were key for you at 4, 13 and then, of course, the one at 18.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   They are key because bogies really take away -- stop the momentum quick and I made a couple of good saves after bunker shots that were less than stellar.   
I made the putts coming back on 4, talking about that one, five feet behind the hole.   13 was another good putt from about 6, 7 feet short of the hole and the one on 18 was certainly a nice way to end the day.  
   
 Q.   You talked about your putting.   Your stroke seemed so smooth.   What have you worked on to get yourself in that position?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I had a great hour or so with Stockton at the Masters and we just talked about just -- kind of in my mind have like a painter, just painting canvass and it just gets me out of the methodical science part of putting and more into the artistic mood.  
   
 Q.   Well played, good luck this weekend.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   You joked you turned a 71 into a 66.   What happened today?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, today was a good day.   Finally nice to finally that score that I felt like I was playing to.   I had been throwing away so much, so many shots, I was turning those 66s into 71s.   I've been doing it for a little while.   It was a good, solid day, made some great putts and saves and finishing with a nice par save on the last hole felt good.  
   
 Q.   What specifically was the difference?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was more of a focus thing, of missing the ball in the right spot, not getting too greedy, not trying to get at a pin that I couldn't get to and missing it in the wrong spot where I was going to make bogey.   
No. 2 was a great example of yesterday trying to get to the back pin, miss it to the right and don't have a chance of getting up and down.   I missed it in the right spots today and hit really good shots on the holes I could get out and putted well.  
   
 Q.   What kind score is it going to take this weekend with the first two rounds?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's hard to predict the scores it's going to take this weekend because we don't know what the weather conditions and pin placements as well as the firmness of the greens will be a big factor.   As long as the greens are receptive, there are some 65s, 66s, 67s.  
   
 Q.   Can you speak about the following you had here and how much fun they're making this tournament for you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I really enjoy coming here to Charlotte.   The tournament is supported by the community as well as any tournament we have out here.   What's amazing what Johnny Harris has done over the last decade or so starting the tournament from scratch and making it one of the premiere stops on the PGA TOUR.   It's impressive and fun for us coming back every year.  
   
 Q.   You struggled on 18 historically.   How much momentum does it mean to get that kind of par?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I love parring 18.   It's a great golf hole.   I hate playing it.   It doesn't fit well to my eye.   It's a tough way to finish the round and walk away with par feels terrific, especially after a double yesterday.   
Just a hard hole for me even though I think it's a great golf hole it sits -- all the shots sit opposite of a left hand shot dispersion.   I never feel comfortable on it.   If it worked opposite I would love it.  
   
 Q.   What's the biggest difference between this week and your play last week?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   The scores, the scores are lower this week than last week.   The difference for me, TPC Sawgrass you can't recover from missed shots.   So you really have to be perfect.   You miss the green and on these ridiculous slopes and rough you can't recover very well.   You have to play kind of U.S. Open strategy.   
Here you can play more the way I like to play, which is aggressive and as long as you miss it in the right spot, you can still salvage pars and walk away with a good score which is why I said earlier how shocked I was that I've actually won at TPC Sawgrass and I haven't won here.   That's irony but I'll have a good shot this weekend.   Hopefully I can finally break through.
