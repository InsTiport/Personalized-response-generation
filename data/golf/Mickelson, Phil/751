 Q. A very eventful round for you, a lot of up-and-downs. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'll tell you why I think this is a great course to hold this event is because the hard holes here are ridiculously hard. And the easy holes are pretty easy, and because of that, we are going to see lots of birdies and bogeys, which is exactly what happened in my round. I didn't hit great shots on the hard holes and I made bogeys and I hit some pretty good shots on the easy holes and I made birdies. And I think it's going to be exciting. That's why we have rounds of 66 and 76, 78. It's the way the course is set up. I think that's going to make for exciting finishes on the weekend. 

 Q. (Inaudible).
 PHIL MICKELSON: I got that from Tommy Roy years ago, TV wants to have birdies and bogeys, they want to have excitement, that's why the tees at Doral would be moved up, and we were hitting driver and wedges, 9-irons on there, on a short par 4 and it made perfect sense. Since then, I've been singing his tune. He's the one that really articulated it well. 

 Q. Seemed like you sized up 18 in a hurry. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's key to know where you can and can't hit it on certain holes because the greens are -- although they are not massive slopes, they are severe. They are so quick that the contours really get running. 

 Q. Did you tweak your left elbow on the fairway shot?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I stung my elbow, it hurt for a few holes on 9. I had to hit a shot hard out of the rough and the rough is pretty thick and heavy. I jarred my elbow. It feels a little bit better but I don't think that will be an issue but it did happen.

 Q. They moved the tees up on 18. Was that a good way to go?
 PHIL MICKELSON: When I play here, I don't play the tees we are playing from. I didn't know we had tees that far back on holes like 9. Holes like 10 is always a par 5 and 12 I'm always on the other side of the street, that's a drivable par 4. 5, I would never dream of going back there, nor do I on 8. These are tee boxes I've never seen or played from because it's such a tight golf course, having to play from those yardages is very difficult. 
 But you know, everybody has got to do it this week. I just don't do it when I have a choice.

 Q. What do you think about where you are right now? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I like where I'm at, not necessarily score-wise. I had a great day with my putter. I didn't make anything outside really ten feet but I made everything inside of seven en, eight feet. That's critical for me. I feel good with it and I'm starting them online and I feel like I'm going to make some more putts as the week goes on. I feel like I'm back on track with that. My short game is coming around. I went and saw Butch on Monday with him and worked with him ball-striking-wise and I feel much better about the direction I'm heading. Although I hit some swirly shots today, I feel like I know what I'm trying to do.

 Q. Do you have clarity about next week or beyond? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm committed to next week. I'm planning on playing. I'm going to fly home Sunday night. It doesn't start until Friday so I don't have to leave until Wednesday night for the Pro-Am and that will give me a few days at home. So I'm definitely going to play next week. 

 Q. The fans in New York --
 PHIL MICKELSON: I love playing here, but I love going by the Statue of Liberty every night. That's cool. Every morning we cruise right by it on the ferry and same thing going back. It makes me appreciate where we live. We live in the greatest place.
