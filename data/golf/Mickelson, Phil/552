  PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a cool way to finish off.   Obviously I didn't play the way I wanted to today, but I had a fun week here.   I couldn't believe the crowds yesterday, just spectacular.   The tournament has turned out to be a really exciting finish.   I think it's going to be very interesting the last few holes.

Q.   How were you feeling today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I felt good.   I just couldn't quite get it going.   I had a couple chances on 2 and 3 to make birdie and eagle and didn't make those, and when I gave one back on 5, it took some momentum away and I ended up making more bogeys.   I felt like it was a day if I could get a hot hand, you just never know.

Q.   But no fatigue or anything setting in?
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, just didn't quite get it going.
