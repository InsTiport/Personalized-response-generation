 Q.  Phil, you feel like you kind of left yourself some work to do now today, right, after --  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm only two back of 4th place so just a solid round tomorrow will be fine.   
But I had a really good start and didn't take advantage of the birdie holes and it was a little disappointing.  Played well and hit a lot of good shots.   
I'm feeling good with the putter.  Let a few shots slide on the birdie holes, unfortunately.  I got a good round in me.  Playing too well not to go out and shoot a number and get in the Top-10 to make it to next week.   
 Q.  Is there an importance to making East Lake or more of a bonus for you?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I'd like to stay sharp heading into the Presidents Cup.  I'd like to compete.   
I'm also playing well enough to get in contention and win again and I want to get in that field because I think, if I do, I think I'll have a really good shot of it.   
 Q.  Will you be doing any scoreboard watching tomorrow?  
PHIL MICKELSON: No.  I just kind of set a number.  I know I got to probably shoot 4, 5-under par.  Like I said, I'm playing well enough to do that with ease.  I let a lot of shots slide today.   
I'm driving the ball well, hitting -- playing well.  I'm going to go out tomorrow and shoot a good number.  It will be plenty.   
 Q.  The way the tournament has gone, it's obviously you got to make a lot of birdies, right, I mean is it okay with you or --  
PHIL MICKELSON: It's great.  It was a lot tougher today, the pins were in tough spots and the greens got a lot firmer.  It was a little bit more difficult.  If you hit good, quality shots you make birdies.
