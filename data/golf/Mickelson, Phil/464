Q.   Sitting on the cut line, two days left on the course.   What is the anticipation like? 
    PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm not really worried either way.   I've got some work to do on the weekend, and if I'm doing it out here at Torrey Pines, great.   If not, I'll be practicing trying to get ready for next week. 
    It's just a fraction off.   I just don't quite feel great.   I've thrown a lot of shots away on the greens, and my iron play hasn't been as good as it has been heading into the start of the year.   So it's just a fraction off.   I've got a few tournaments coming up now.   I'll be playing the next three after this as well.   So I want to see if I can get it turned around and get it going.

Q.   You said the 17, how confident were you about making the cut and going in making a couple birdies instead of bogeys? 
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Obviously, the cut was the last thing on my mind.   I was trying to make one or two birdies to get within striking distance if I shot a low round tomorrow.   So making bogey the last two holes kind of hurt and brought me back to where the cut line is a factor.

Q.   Talk about the gloves.   Was it that slick out there (Indiscernible)?
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, it's all the water.   Yeah, it's tough to get a good grip on the grip and get a good traction.   But these all‑weather gloves gave me much better control of the club, but it still wasn't easy.   It was still sliding a little bit.

Q.   It seemed like it was playing a little extra and long than it normally does out there with the rain?
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, this is probably the longest golf course we play on TOUR, overall yardage, as well as the fact that it's at sea level.   So you throw in rain and heavy air and it's a long golf course.

Q.   How different was your club selection going in with the 4‑iron as opposed to a 6‑iron?   I mean, how often‑‑ how much yardage were you losing on that? 
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Quite a bit.   It was 4‑irons into most every hole.   It's a long golf course.   But when that happens, you just have to play for par.   You play for the middle of the green, try to make par.   And, unfortunately, I made a couple bogeys coming in.

Q.   Your second shot on 17, obviously, you don't do that very often.   What did happen? 
    PHIL MICKELSON:   It's just a little tough to keep control of the club, and the club just slipped over in my hand.   Nobody out here is going to hit a shot that crazy sideways from the fairway.   The club just turned.
