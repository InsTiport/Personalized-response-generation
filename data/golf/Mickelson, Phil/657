 Q. Talk about your round a little bit, please. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it was a frustrating back nine for me. I got off to a poor start tripling 10. I enjoyed the tournament, I enjoyed the chance I had heading into today, and it was a fun go there. I had some opportunities the front nine that could have got the round lower. I shot 1-under on the front and was going to try to make a move on the back, but it wouldn't have mattered; Charley played some great golf. I had some good positives come out of this week that I'll probably carry over into next.

 Q. What are some of the positives?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I started to drive the ball a lot better, I started to feel much better on the greens with the putter, and the game is slowly coming around. 

 Q. Was it the lack of your ability to practice this week that had anything to do with any inconsistency?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I just haven't been getting into the flow of the round. I got a lot closer this week. It came around a lot better. 

 Q. Talk about your search for No. 1. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm just trying to get my game right now, and today I took some positives -- not from the day but from the week.

 Q. What's it like playing in Boston, the way the galleries treat you?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Pretty cool place here. There's a lot of amazing sports fans here in this town. This is a town that just loves sports, and there's no better feel than going to Fenway Park when those Red Sox are in the playoff hunt, and for us to have our Playoffs here in Boston, it's a great fit.
