Q.   Why don't you start off with the excitement at No.9.   You found the ball.   That was a terrific third shot you hit. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I got lucky.   After a great drive, coiled one left of the corporate tent and was lucky it wasn't out of bounds.   Then my drop left me a pretty unobstructed shot and I hit a good shot to two feet and made birdie.   I got lucky there at the end to finish with a birdie. 

Q.   Talk about the way you played.   I thought your iron shot at 17 might have been your best of the day. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I hit a good one at 17 to make a birdie.   My timing was a little off today.   My rhythm just wasn't quite the way it's been the last few rounds where the club just hasn't been going through impact as smoothly, but it's just a fraction off, and I've been hitting it so good that I'm not too worried about it.   I'll work on it in the morning and it should just settle in.   But I didn't shoot myself out of it.   It wasn't the round I wanted, but shooting 3‑under there on the back and finishing at 3‑under, if I can go out tomorrow and get a hot round of 6‑, 7‑, 8‑under par, which is out there, it'll just move right up the leaderboard heading into the weekend, which is the goal.
