   PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought it was a really fair test.  It was a little windier but it wasn't unplayable.  There were under-par scores out there.  I just didn't putt well enough to have one of them. 

 Q.  How disappointed are you about today's round? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought I was playing a lot better than this.  I was starting to play some pretty good golf last week.  I don't know why I have putted these greens so poorly.  They're very good grains, they're a very good texture.  I've seen a lot of guys, like I said, make putts. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I thought par would probably make the cut, I just hit a drive in the water and made double. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was an imbedded ball and this is the only week that it is not through the green.  It's got to be in the closely mown area.  So both the referee and I were off a little bit.  51 weeks out of the year it includes the whole golf course and this week it's got to be just closely mown areas.  It was an accurate ruling, but we're just not used to it because it's just this week. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, no, it was accurate. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I said it's imbedded and should I take a drop?  And he said absolutely.  And we proceeded under the normal imbedded ball rule.  But over here, this one week, it's got to be only in a closely mown area.  So it wasn't, so we went back and I had to put it back in the imbedded mark and then I could either play it or take an unplayable lie, which I took an unplayable lie.  It was an accurate ruling.  I had no problems with it. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was stationary -- the rule is it has to be stationary five seconds, which it was.  And then after a minute or so, you just play it where it lies, unless I addressed it, which I never did, because I felt like it might roll. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Oh, I don't know, I don't know.  It's fair for everybody, no problems with it. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought 4-over would be the cut line, but you never know, you never know. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't look.  I just figured it would probably be about 3 or 4 over. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  That's a good question.  I was just never on the line.  I didn't start on line at the right speed.  They're rolling great.  You can make putts on them.  The golf course is terrific.  I really am impressed. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know, it's hard to say.  I've missed a lot of cuts lately.  I missed U.S. Open, Congressional, most likely here.  So this is -- I don't know, it's -- I better get better.  I think my next tournament doesn't have a cut, that will be nice (laughter). 

 Q.  Do you think you'll hang around for the weekend and watch what's going on and follow the groups? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably not (laughter).
