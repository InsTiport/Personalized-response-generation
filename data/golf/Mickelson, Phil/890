  Q.  Kind of a roller coaster for you today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't get off to a great start today, bogeying two par-5s on the back.  That's really where you've got to score.  Fortunately I was able to turn it around.  I made a birdie on 17 and had a good stretch on 1, 2 and 3 where I went birdie, birdie, eagle, and that was the round right there.  I tried to get a couple more coming in, missed some good opportunities, but I'll take it because where I was at, it didn't look good.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  You know, it's 15, 20 feet.  You've got to hit a good putt and read it right.  I had a couple of good chances coming in.  I'll certainly take 3-under because after the start, it was looking like I could shoot myself right out of it, and now at least if I have a good round tomorrow I can get right back up on top of the leaderboard.   
  
  Q.  Did the cold affect you at all?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  You know, it was cold but it shouldn't have made a difference in the scoring like the way I played.  It wasn't that bad.  I just hit a couple of poor shots.  But fortunately got it turned around.   
  
  Q.  Kenny Perry said some of the greens were kind of frozen this morning.  It obviously must have had an effect somewhere along the line early?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, the balls were taking big bounces early on, but as it warmed up, that turned to moisture and the ball started stopping and we were able to make some birdies.   
  
  Q.  Given last year, how important was it just to get off to a good start in round one here this year?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was unrelated to last year.  I just wanted to play well today.  I felt like I was playing well coming from San Diego, but I still had a few things I needed to work on that were not where I wanted it.  But I felt like I got it turned around in the middle of the round.   
  
  Q.  How has your health been?  How are you feeling?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Good, I feel good.   
  
  Q.  You sound a lot better than you did yesterday.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Thanks, yeah, it's coming.   
  
  Q.  The par-5s, were those just errant shots early?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I drove it in the water on 13, and that was a penalty shot.  And then 15, I laid up and hit a poor shot in the bunker and didn't get up-and-down, just a poor swing.   
  
  Q.  But you were able to come back on the back nine.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  There's a lot of golf, and you just can't worry about one or two putts once you're there.  Fortunately I was able to get it going in the middle part of the round.   
  
  Q.  How was the crowd on 16 today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, it's pretty good.  We were out there early.  We teed off on the back and it was early, so it wasn't like it normally is, but it's a fun hole.
