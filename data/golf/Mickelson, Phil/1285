Q.  6?

PHIL MICKELSON:  6 was 8-iron, 12 feet.  7 was 2-iron, tee.  8-iron four feet.  Made it.  9 was 3-wood in the left rough.  8-iron back fringe, 18 feet.  Made.  10 was 2-iron in the left rough, wedge front right and 3-putt.


Q.  Birdied 13?

PHIL MICKELSON:  Hit driver 2-iron, pin-high left just off the green, got up-and-down.  I bogeyed 15.  I drove it in the left bunker.  Hit 4-iron short or hit 4-iron left of the green, chipped up 8 feet and missed it.  And 17 I hit 3-wood sand wedge to 15 feet.  And made it.


Q.  I guess just a couple of thoughts about your round.  The front 9 was a good start.  You gained confidence so far when you go out here in the first round like this?

PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I think it was important for me to get off to a good start because so much rides on this tournament.  I didn't want to get too far behind early.  So it was important for me to get off to a good start.  And three times in the first five holes I had it within 6 feet for birdie and wasn't able to capitalize.


Q.  Where were those?

PHIL MICKELSON:  On 2, I had it 6 feet.  On 4 I had it 8 feet.  On 5 I had it 4 feet.  Although they were difficult putts, I didn't get off to the best start early, but I was patient throughout the day, and it turned around.  And I made a 12-footer for par on 8.  So I had a stretch there of making a lot.


Q.  Patient throughout the day?

PHIL MICKELSON:  That was kind of the key to playing.


Q.  Did you sense the course is going to get tougher?

PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, if it rains it's going to get easier, and if it stays like this it will progressively get more difficult. As the greens firm up it will be harder and harder to get the ball closer to the fairway, and also to get the ball up-and-down on these greens.


Q.  Pretty good up-and-downs when you had them?

PHIL MICKELSON:  You know, I got up-and-down out of the sand today four times.  I was four for four out of bunkers.  And that was a big key, because they weren't really that easy of bunker shots.


Q.  Because that seems to be the big key to this course?

PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes.


Q.  Is getting up-and-down, when you miss those greens.

PHIL MICKELSON:  That's true.
