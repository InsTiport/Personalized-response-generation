Q.   What's the most difficult part of a disjointed round like this? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't mind it.   I think that if you get into a good rhythm for the day, you get extra holes to play, and I think that guys that have a hot hand, instead of playing 18, they have a chance to play 27, 31 or 32.   I think it could be a real benefit if you're playing well.

Q.   Your putting has come, around beautifully and this would appear to be sort of difficult conditions to find your putting stroke.   How do you explain that? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I have not been worried about my putting even though I had problems the first few weeks of the year.   That's not been the issue for me.   It has not been an area of concern, especially in the off‑season. 
It's such a small stroke that it's just not a hard fix.   It seemed pretty easy to get it back.   You get greens like this that are just perfect condition and very soft movement around the holes and you're going to make a lot of putts.   It just builds confidence. 

Q.   How do you feel about the rest of your game? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I didn't hit it as well as I've been hitting it.   So I feel like there's some room for improvement. 
It felt really good yesterday.   Today my rhythm was a little bit off this morning.   So I'll get to the range and I'll have a couple‑of‑hour break to be able to get the rhythm back. 
But I was a little bit quick and out of sync and hit some shots that didn't feel very solid but was able to get the ball in the hole.

Q.   Does this take a toll, stop, start over two days, are you tired? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't mind it.   It's kind of part of the deal.   Like I was saying, if you get into a good rhythm, you get more holes to play in that one day and I think that it could be a benefit, especially if you get a good feel. 

Q.   This second round was really good for you.   I thought that was pretty solid.   You have to be pleased?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I am.   It was a good round.   You know, 3‑under par got me back into position where I could make a move on the third round and that's kind of the goal.   I'll see if I can get a little bit better rhythm and get‑‑ I feel good on the greens, so give myself some more opportunities.

Q.   How are the conditions out there now compared to earlier in the week? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   They are not as difficult as we may be making them look because the greens are soft and receptive.   So when you hit solid shots, they will hold the greens.   That's a big thing, when you get the wind blowing, especially sideways, because once it hits the green, if the greens are firm, it just takes it right off, but they are soft and receptive so we are able to get at the pins.
