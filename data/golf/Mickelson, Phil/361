Q.   Not as much of a round as you'd like?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I felt like I putted really well.   I felt really good with the putter.   The ball striking that was there the first two days kind of fell out and I had a tougher time putting them all together.   Doesn't feel far off.   I don't know if I'll have a good round tomorrow or not.   But it's close.   Lot closer than it's been.

Q.   Does the Monday finish ruin your preparation?
PHIL MICKELSON:   No.   I usually take Mondays off.   I have nothing scheduled.   I've actually done preparations for the Masters.   I know how I'm going to play it.   Monday is going to be a day off.   If I end up playing the final round here, it's fine.

Q.   Given where you're sitting, just how would your approach, kind of -- like kind of be based on the weather?
PHIL MICKELSON:   For me, I just try to put it together.   I'm trying to get all the parts put together on the same day, and I've had trouble doing that.   The putter felt great today the ball striking was off.   The first two days I struck it great.   So going into the final round rather than worrying about winning or I'm trying to put them all together and shoot a really good round.   Get a little bit of momentum next week.   You never know if you shoot a really low one, you never know what happens.
