 Q.   Phil, I was a little scared for you today, you walked into snake country a couple of times after some wayward drives?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, my ball‑striking was a touch off today.   I hit a few drives in some bad spots.  
Yesterday I kept it in check and didn't really have too many big misses.   I had a bunch of big misses today.   I was able to shoot even par with it.   I putted well and hit some good iron shots but I'll have to work on it tomorrow.   My driving actually felt really good heading into here.   I played Augusta the last few days before, and I was driving it great.  
But I haven't hit it the way I feel I've been hitting it.   Hopefully this weekend I'll get it back.   
   
 Q.   I thought that you stayed mentally engaged throughout the round, too.   You were mentally focused the entire way through, something you said you wanted to work on?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I did do a good job of staying focused.   I was disappointed on one hole where I made a double on 6.   I tried to stay really sharp and just leave it a bogey.   A lot of times when I got in trouble and I didn't hit great shots I was able to salvage them with good up‑and‑downs and maintain a pretty good focus on the greens, made some good saving putts.  
So it was a good first two days and I'm looking forward to hopefully improving on it on the weekend.
