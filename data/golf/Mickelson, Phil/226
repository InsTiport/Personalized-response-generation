A flash interview with:
PHIL MICKELSON
Q. Just comment on the round.  You got off to a good start there.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah.  I got off to a good start.  I hit a lot of good shots today.  Again, I had trouble finishing it off, making the putts.
I couldn't quite get it close enough and I didn't quite make the 12- to 30-footers.  But I hit a lot of good shots and then I unfortunately bogeyed 14 and 15.  That kind of let the round get away.
I didn't score as low as I'd like or I feel I'm playing.  I'm looking forward to having another shot at this golf course tomorrow.
Q. Going into the weekend, what's the plan?
PHIL MICKELSON: If I can play the way I played these first two rounds and just capitalize on a few opportunities, I think I can shoot 6-, 7-, 8-under par and get back in it for Sunday.
