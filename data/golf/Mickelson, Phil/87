Q. Phil, it's a simple question.  What happened at 13?
PHIL MICKELSON: Look, I don't mean disrespect to anybody.  I know it's a two-shot penalty.  At that time, I just didn't feel like going back and forth and hitting the same shot over.  I took the two-shot penalty and moved on.  It's my understanding of the rules.  I've had multiple times where I've wanted to do that.  I just finally did.
Q. Did you think the ball was going to roll off the green when you hit it?
PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, no question.  It was going to go down in the same spot behind the bunker.  I wasn't going to have a shot.  I don't know if I was able to save a shot or not.  I know it's a two-shot penalty hitting a moving ball.  I tried to hit it as close as I could on the next one, and you take the two shots and move on.
Q. Does it show disrespect to the Championship?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's certainly not meant that way.  It's meant to take advantage of the rules as best as you can.  In that situation, I was just going back and forth.  I would gladly take the two shots over continuing that display.
Q. You're really admired around this golfing world, especially at the U.S. Open.  What do you say to the people who love you so much, follow you?  Do you regret what you've done?
PHIL MICKELSON: I've had an awesome day.  It's been incredible.  Singing happy birthdays, wishing happy birthdays.  The people have made coming here over the decades an awesome experience.  It's a fun birthday.
I don't mean it in any disrespect.  And if that's the way people took it, I apologize to them, but that's not the way it was taken.  I took the two-shot penalty, moved on, and there's not much more to say.
