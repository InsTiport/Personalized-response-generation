 Q. That second nine that didn't get off to too good of a start with a mud ball on 10, electrifyingly turned around on 13 when you made your eagle and you went on an eagle, eagle, birdie stretch. Tell me about those three holes. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, the bounces seemed to pay off or even out, I guess. I had an unfortunate break on 10 where you cannot go right and there was mud on the ball left which is going to shoot it right and it went there. 
 But you don't plan on balls like on 14 going in the hole. It just kind of evens out over the course of 72 holes. 

 Q. You seemed to be in full command of your game today, the best I've seen all year; your rhythm, your pace, your golf swing looked to be under control. How does that bode for you going into tomorrow in the final round?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I haven't played this well in a long time and I feel like my game's as good as it's been and I'm looking forward to it. 
 I love this tournament more than any other, I love Sunday being in contention. Today was a good day, I've been playing well and shot a good number that got me right in it and I'm excited about Sunday.

 Q. As well as loving this place I know how much your family means to you. And with all that you've gone through, how special would this be tomorrow to be able to bring it home for them for Amy, for your mom, for everybody, with all that you've gone through over the past years?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well it would be cool. This is the first week that they have traveled with me since THE PLAYERS last year and it's fun having them there. It's fun just being together and so it's been a fun week.
