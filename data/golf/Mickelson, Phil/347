Q.   Better today, or how would you‑‑
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I played well yesterday and I played well today.   I didn't finish the round yesterday, obviously, and played the last three and five over and played well today again. 
And my game is feeling good.   It actually is feeling good.   I just have some challenges.   And I'm glad I'm playing this weekend.   It will give me two more rounds on a good golf course to see if I can have something to build on.

Q.   Sort of what you were looking for, right, coming in, is to have something to build on?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes.   There's two things that I'm doing really well this week so far:   I'm shaping my iron shots.   I'm getting a lot of iron shots close.   And the second thing is I'm putting much more aggressively.   I've had some three‑putts, and that's going to happen, but I'm trying to run every putt by and putt aggressively.   I've ended up making more putts too.

Q.   You talked yesterday or on Wednesday about making sure you're chipping your short game sharp?   Where's that right now, chipping short game?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I haven't missed too many greens and haven't relied on it too much.   But it's been okay. 
The two areas that have been good are my iron play has been good.   I've been able to shape shots both ways, get a lot of shots close.   And I feel like I've putted fairly aggressively.   It feels good to see the ball run through the hole rather than limp up there.

Q.   Phil, is getting into contention something that you need to do too or that you feel like you want to have?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It would be nice.   I mean, it would be nice.   But baby steps here.   I've had a little rough go.   Although my game feels good, I still have some challenges mentally and finishing the round yesterday, that's a great example there. 
If I finish that round off, I'm up there top two or three.   So it's little things like that that are making the big difference between where I'm at, 30th, and top 5.

Q.   Do you put that off yesterday to not physical errors but you made the wrong decisions?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know exactly.   I just got tired.   I didn't stay focused the entire round and let a lot of shots slide in the end, and you can't afford to do that.

Q.   Are you comfortable turning it over as you are, holding off a shot?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I am.   But I do like hitting more cut drivers off the tee in an effort to hit more fairways.   And I don't mind drawing iron shots.   That's easier.   But I don't try to hit too many draws with the driver here because the fairways are running and I don't want the ball running that much because it just seems to run into bad places, not good.
