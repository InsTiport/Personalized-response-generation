Q. 2-under.  How would you assess round three here in tough conditions?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I actually thought it was a successful round.  It was difficult out there, especially around the turn there, 9, 10 -- 8, 9, 10, and that was really the only point where I had a couple of bogeys and it was very difficult, but I was able to come back with a few birdies when it cleared up.  And I thought anything in the 60s was going to be a heck of a round, and I was one shy.  And but I got a good chance going into tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it.
Q. How critical was that turnaround at 13 and 14 to get back in it?
PHIL MICKELSON: Again, I was 1-over.  If I could have just gotten under par.  And I ended up making a birdie there on 13.  And 14 was very reachable with the way the wind was.  And certainly fortunate to make eagle, but a birdie was much, very much a reality and anything under par, I thought was a good round.
Q. Why have you had so much success here?
PHIL MICKELSON: I just enjoy it here and I think the challenging conditions oftentimes comes into play.  I think the grass and the little half shots to get back to some of these pins, a lot of guys struggle with and it's been a strength of my game, so I've been able to make a few more birdies on some of these holes.
Q. Three back heading into Sunday.  What are some of the keys to get another win here at Pebble?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I just have to play solid, a good solid round and make a move.  Usually the winner comes from groups in front of the last group, so it will be a challenge for us to keep pace.  And obviously Paul's playing some great golf, so he's going to be tough to catch no matter what.  But I just need to shoot a good solid round in the 60s.
Q. How much does your success here in the past come into play tomorrow under these circumstances, do you think?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm not sure that it will be much of a factor.  But the fact that I've had good rounds here, especially on the final round, gives me some confidence going into tomorrow, but it doesn't really help today.  You still have to go out tomorrow morning and execute.
Q. Specific conditions that you're rooting for tomorrow that's best for you?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't mind if it gets really rough.  But I also love it if it's a beautiful sunny day walking around Pebble, so there's nothing better than that.  But I think for me to have my best chance it would, the weather would have to come in.
Q. Was there any adjustment from Waste Management to here in terms of what you worked on, or was Waste Management just an anomaly?
PHIL MICKELSON: I took a chance, I thought.  I had been working on getting a different driver in play, and I took a chance thinking I had figured something out at Waste Management, and I ended up driving it awful into the water.  And I went back to the driver I played well with in Palm Springs and I'll stay with that all the way through Augusta.  But I thought I was going to go get a little bit of extra yardage and it didn't quite work out.  I ended up hitting it a little more crooked than normal.  Not that I'm straight, but it was a little worse than normal.  And so back to driving the ball pretty well.
Q. You went at it pretty hard on those two shots at 14.  Was that at about a hundred percent there?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, the drive on 14 was a hellacious bomb.  That thing was way out there.  I can barely reach that hole ever and I had 4-iron in.  So that thing was pretty nasty.  And I went after it pretty good.
