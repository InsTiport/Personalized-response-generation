 Q.  2-under, looked like a hard day's work? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was.  It got very difficult the last nine.  The wind picked up and it became very difficult. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I wouldn't say it tests a lot of imagination.  I just think you have to know where the big slopes are and avoid them because there's spots that you just can't go and be able to get up-and-down. 

 Q.  How much tougher did it get as the round wore on? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Quite a bit.  It was where par was a good score.  The front nine you felt like you should make a lot of birdies and every hole was a birdie hole, and then the back nine with the wind you were just trying to make pars every hole. 

 Q.  How tough is it to drive the golf ball out here with the shape of the fairways? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's not tough to drive it, it's just tough to drive it in the fairway, yeah (laughter).  But that's the case every week for me, so I don't know if it's just this week or what. 

 Q.  How are your changes?  Do you see progress? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Today was a tough day of ball-striking.  It wasn't just the driver, it was the irons, it was the 3-woods off the tee.  I didn't strike it as well as I wanted to.  I didn't get in the rhythm.  I hit it good the first seven or eight holes, and then after that I hit some squirrelly shots, but I was able to get up-and-down and shoot under par the back side. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I made a lot of putts the back nine and missed a lot the front. 

 Q.  How does this compare to Muirfield in terms of setup or imagination?  You said you don't need a lot here.  Do you need a lot there? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think that there's a lot of shot-making around the greens at Muirfield, where here, there's a lot of swales and hollows that the ball goes in and you only have one shot you can hit.  You don't have a variety like you might at Muirfield. 

 Q.  Will you talk to Butch now about how you did today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I'll give him a call tonight because it wasn't quite setting in the way I wanted it to, the rhythm of it and so forth. 

 Q.  That's common now that you're working with him, you talk once or twice at every tournament? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  We talk a reasonable amount.
