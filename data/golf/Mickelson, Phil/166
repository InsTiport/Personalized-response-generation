Q. We heard from you after the match.  Now that the Ryder Cup has been clinched, curious of a couple of things with your thoughts.  You were adamant in the last couple of years that change needed to be made for the United States to succeed in the Ryder Cup.  Do you think the difference in strategy affected the outcome this week?
PHIL MICKELSON: I have been a part of ten successful Presidents Cups, and eight losing Ryder Cups, and it's very easy to see what the difference is.  And these guys are some incredibly talented players.  When put in the right environment, the U.S. team brought out some of their most amazing golf.  We're bringing home the Ryder Cup because of it.
I'm so proud to be part of the team, I'm so proud to know these guys, to experience this together, to share these emotions, to celebrate tonight.  And I've known that these guys have had this level of performance in them for sometime.  It's just amazing to watch.  I think we all who are watching just really enjoyed this week and some of the shots that everybody hit.
