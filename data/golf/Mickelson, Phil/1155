PHIL MICKELSON:  There's not much more I can do.  I had to birdie the last few holes to have a shot at it.  Hopefully I'll play well tomorrow, if not I'll come back and play well at Match Play.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

PHIL MICKELSON:   I didn't play very well today.  I didn't hit a fairway the first 11 drives, although they landed in the fairway and kicked out.  They were close.  I just didn't play very well.  Fortunately, I birdied the last two holes to have a shot at making the cut.  I'd like to play tomorrow.  I think I could have a good round if I had an opportunity.


Q.  (Fourth straight week)?

PHIL MICKELSON:   It's not difficult to play four in a row.  I like playing tournaments.  I feel very ready to play.  I'm in a good competitive frame of mind.  But I will take next week off to get ready for Match Play and the Ford Championship at Doral and then get geared up for the Masters.


Q.  Are you surprised Vijay is out?

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I think we're all a little surprised.  He finished Top 10, 12 straight weeks.  You don't expect him to miss the cut.  I think he had such a great run for such a long time, it's bound to come to an end sometime.  We're surprised it happened here.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

PHIL MICKELSON:   It doesn't hurt, knowing I played well the first three weeks.  If I had a poor performance yesterday and today, I would play it off as a fluke rather than the trend.  I feel like I have been playing well, if I have a chance tomorrow, I should be able to turn things around and have a good day.  I feel I could turn it around tomorrow.  I don't feel it's that far off.
