Q. Just talk about today's round.
PHIL MICKELSON: It was the most challenging I've seen this golf course play, especially given that the greens were very receptive.  The wind made it play very difficult and there were some challenging pin positions.
But I played pretty good golf today.  I had two bogeys, and they were both three-putts.  I hit a lot of good shots and I hit a few bad ones but they weren't too bad.  And it was an okay start.  I've got to get it going, but it was an okay start.
