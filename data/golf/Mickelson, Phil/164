Q. Ten birdies and it wasn't enough.  Ever seen a match like that under these circumstances?
PHIL MICKELSON: Probably not.  At least that I've been involved in.  This was a hard fought battle today and a lot of emotion.  I thought that we both played really well and probably fitting end to have it a tie.
Q. Some day when your career is over, you will have some phenomenal memories.  Where will this one stand?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, we've got to finish this off first.  It looks very positive.  But these guys have played some incredible golf.  If we finish this off, we've got a memory and life experience that we'll cherish forever.
