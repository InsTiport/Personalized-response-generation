 Q.  Just a thought on the round, 4-under, pretty good start. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I really enjoy the golf course.  It's a fun challenge and it's in incredible shape.  I hit some good shots to get off to a good start and I was 3-under through four and just played steady there after.  Hit some good shots, didn't quite make as many birdies, but played a good, solid round for a good start. 
 Niclas Fasth played a wonderful round of golf to shoot 8-under par, and it shows that there's a very low score out there.  But, it's still difficult to do and I was very pleased with my round. 

 Q.  Presumably it's still golf, although it's your first competitive round in China, were there any differences you saw out there in it's still very assumably the same in many ways? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's a very similar golf course to what we play in the States with the bermudarough and bentgreens, and the bunkers are wonderful.  I thought it was a good, fair test of golf.  I played well to shoot 4-under. 

 Q.  You obviously know Paul (Casey) quite well. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah. 

 Q.  But first look at Liang Wen-chong, the young Chinese player. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I was very pleased with Liang, he's a wonderful player.  He hit a lot of good shots, great iron shots, too, and made some good putts.  I think he's a very talented player and I think he'll continue to have -- he's had good success on The European Tour.  I think he's got some great things to come. 

 Q.  You're obviously feeling a bit better; you look a bit better than did you in Singapore. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I feel a lot better, thank you.
