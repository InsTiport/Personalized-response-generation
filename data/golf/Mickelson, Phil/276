  PHIL MICKELSON:   I had a really good start to the round.   I turned a 66 into 71 today but I played 11 holes really well.   I played 7 holes very poorly.   I'll have to improve on that tomorrow but game doesn't feel far off.   
I hit a few poor shots.   What I'm pleased with, I am still making a number of birdies and that gives me hope because it's much easier to eliminate mistakes than it is to make birdies.  
   
 Q.   So you played 7 poorly.   Was there a common theme?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I made the middle of the round, turn 18, 1 and 2 played 4-over.   I didn't birdie the easy holes like 14, 15 or 7 and 8.   Those are the holes you really got to take advantage of and I didn't do it.   I made birdies on a lot of tough holes and fortunately though I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament.   I just got to come out and put -- get the 66, 65 that I could have very well had today.   I got to do that tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Have I or could I?  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I think the beauty of Quail Hollow is in the simplicity of the course.   I think it's one of the best courses we have tee to green. It forces you to maneuver the ball both ways.   It's very demanding into the greens.   I think in the past the greens have -- were so overdone it took away from some of its beauty and greatness.   Since the changes it's really added something to it because they've softened some of the areas that made it -- just made it simpler and better.
