  Q. What was the thinking in playing here again this year?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I try to play here every year that I can - the only times that I haven't come has been to do with scheduling more than anything. But this year it's perfect with Carnoustie being The Open site next week and this being so close I was able to come into town and play some practice rounds at Carnoustie and still get over here for the tournament.   
  
  Q. How does that tally in terms of the fact that it's a different form of golf next week?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think it's that different. The courses look and play different but the shots ar similar. It's windy here, you want to keep the ball below the tree line to keep in it out of the win - just like Carnoustie. Both are very good tests.   
  
  Q. How did you find Carnoustie?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't realise what a wonderful golf course it is. It's terrific.   
  
  Q. Is that some repressed memories?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes!   
  
  Q. How's the wrist?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's doing okay. It's not quite 100 per cent but it's fine and I don't think it'll affect my shots.   
  
  Q. do you have treatment every day?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes.   
  
  Q. Does it affect the amount you can practice?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It did, but not any more.   
  
  Q. If you had an inkling that the rough was going to be as it was at Carnoustie in 1999 would you have had second thoughts about playing?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't think that would happen. Ever since Peter Dawson has taken over the set-ups at The Open have been as good as they could possibly be. He is wonderful for the R&A and I didn't have any doubts because the last six or seven years. I was excited to see how Carnoustie would be set up. It's very challenging but there are a lot of opportunities to separate themselves through good play.   
  
  Q. Does it suit your game?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I have still not played as well in The British open as I would have like so I stil have to perfect some of the shot-making over here. But, with that being said, I love it. I think links golf is tremendous.   
  
  Q. Do you have a theory as to why you don't do as well in THE Open as the other Majors?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I just haven't shot the lowest score yet. I am still working on it. I think that the wind affects the ball very much but I have been working on that and over the last couple of months I have been hitting some shots that would really help me next week.   
  
  Q. Coming off the back of Wimbeldon and the Federer / Nadal match - what do you think a sustained Woods / Mickelson rivalry would do for golf?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know but he is one of the two best golfers to have ever played and I think every player loves the chance to compete against him and try to win because when you are able to win with him in the field it gives your victory more credibility.   
  
  Q. If you were to play well here this week and win, would that be good for you in terms of next week or would it take a bit too much out of you?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think that it could go either way. I remember Vijay Singh won the PGA in 2004 after missing the cut the previous week, so it doesn't have an effect either way. If you miss the cut you have extra practice days and if you win you are obviously playing well. But if you win it might take some emotional energy out. I was fortunate enough to win the Masters after winning the week before and because of that I hope to do well here.
