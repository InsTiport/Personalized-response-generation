   PHIL MICKELSON: I felt like I wasn't far off after yesterday's round, even though the score didn't reflect it. I had a good conversation with Butch and Dave Stockton last night, and I think it settled in today. I was able to make the last adjustment and it felt great. I hit the ball much better and putted much better.

 Q. Did you have to take any chances or did the birdies just come naturally?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't have to do too much, but it was a difficult day. It was playing long, and it was important to hit some good drives. I hit some decent tee shots and was able to play aggressive from there.

 Q. That's a heck of a move from 83rd yesterday to 9th right now. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: We, we still have the afternoon rounds, and it'll probably end up 15th to 20th after two rounds, but I'm in a position where a good round tomorrow and I can get in contention for Sunday, so that's where I wanted to get myself.

 Q. Will you approach things the same tomorrow?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I've got to go low tomorrow, I know that, but it's out there if you play well.
