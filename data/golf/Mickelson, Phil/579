  Q. Give us the analysis of the long putter in the maiden voyage.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I got off to a great start with it, making about a ten-footer on the first hole for birdie and then an eight-footer on the second for birdie. I thought it went well. I feel that I'm probably putting better with that putter than I would be the short putter, so I'll end up using it for the rest of the tournament I would anticipate. But I don't know if it's a short-term or a long-term thing, but it feels good.  
  
  Q. I thought the stroke was good.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I feel pretty good with it. I thought that I was starting them on line, and I've got to get comfortable with the speed and so forth. That's a little different. But like I say, I don't know if it's short-term or long-term, but right now it feels pretty good.  
  
  Q. Is there any particular nuance of it that helps your stroke?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I honestly don't know. I haven't spent enough time with it. The guys that have used it for a long time, Brendan Steele, Keegan Bradley, Martin Laird, Webb Simpson, those guys really know a lot more about it and the intricacies of it, but it felt good today. I enjoyed it. I had fun today.   
  
  Q. Can you forward press when you putt? Can you do the same thing with the long putter?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, you can't forward press with it, no.  
  
  Q. Do you compensate for it in some way?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, it just passes through better. It passes my hands, so it's a different stroke. That's probably why it's a little bit more awkward at first for me because I'm used to keep my hands ahead, and this time the club is passing my hands.  
  
  Q. What kind of comments did the Red Sox fans give you about your Yankee pinstriped pants?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, obviously I was on the Red Sox last night and lost a wager with a friend and had to wear these today. What can you say? I've got to suck it up and bear it.
