 Q.  About his round today. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  I fought hard with that 5-over.  Tough day with the wind picking up in the afternoon.  Have fought both rounds to hang in there.  I think the wind's going to blow tomorrow which means over par is going to win.  I'll only have to shoot under par and I'll right back in it.  You have got to execute. 

 Felt great teeing off.  Felt good with my putter.  Didn't get any momentum.  Hung in there.  Felt differently from yesterday. 

 On 11, hit it in trees.  Thought I might have to pack my bags and go home.  But came out with a five and made two birdies coming in.  Made a couple of great putts the last nine holes.  If you made the cut, I think you have a chance to win it. 

 Q.  In reference to the grind. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a tough fight.  Came out at 8:30, it was calm.  At about 2:30 the wind picked up.  Tough on 11, 12 and 13.  The flag was blowing in different ways. 

 I drove it in the left trees.  I tried to go through a gap and came to a rest on a man-made obstruction.  I got relief and got it out 100 yards and hit it to six feet and made putt for bogey.  It was a good bogey. 

 I've got to hit more fairways. 

 First day, I drove horrible.  Putted horrible.  Second day, just drove it horrible and putted better.  So I should be okay.
