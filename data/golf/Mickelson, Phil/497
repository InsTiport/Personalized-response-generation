 Q.   First bogey‑free round since Sunday at AT&T.   That's a good thing.   Talk about how you're rolling the rock right now.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I feel really good.   I feel really good on the short ones, and the only two I missed I actually hit right where I wanted to, good speed and just misread it a touch, but I made a lot of them to keep the round going.   Those are the ones I've been giving back and have been taking away some momentum.   I've been playing well and giving too many shots around the greens back, and I feel really good with how I'm rolling it.   And tomorrow with some pure greens and hopefully calmer conditions, we'll be able to really get it going.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a nickname for the grip?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't have a name for it.   It's just a couple of friends of mine have been using it for 10, 12 years and they putt phenomenal with it.   On fast greens it's even better because the touch and the sensitivity is there.   The key for me was the putter I have, the PT‑18, has adjustable weights, and I was able to make it a lot heavier, put in a lot heavier grams, so 40 grams instead of 20, so it's a ton heavier, and that way the sensitivity is there and the head stays very stable.   I think with a light putter it would be difficult to do.
