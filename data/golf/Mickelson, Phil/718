  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Shot a couple under and looking forward to the weekend. It wasn't as windy or as strong a wind today as it was yesterday. Would have been nice to finish earlier, but we just missed it.   
  
  Q. Where were you, on what hole?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: 18.   
  
  Q. Not the delay. The wind when it changed directions.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I was on 10, second shot on 10.   
  
  Q. How did it change things for you? Did you have a club in hand already?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It made some holes harder, some holes easier. I mean, 12 was no longer reachable, but 16 you could drive it down by the green. It didn't really matter.   
  
  Q. Circling back with you on the grooves thing that you were pretty passionate about earlier, were you happier with the way things were resolved? Looks like they are going to be more transparent, to use your words?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's good. I hope some positive things come from it and it's not just lip service, but I believe that it will be a good thing.  
  
  Q. People at Callaway happy that it's a step that way, if you've talked to them?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I haven't talked to anybody about it, no. It just happened, what, two it days ago; no, I haven't talked to anybody.
