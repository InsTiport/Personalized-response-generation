   PHIL MICKELSON: We had some great anchor play, Ben Curtis and Chad Campbell are playing great, just in case our guys didn't close it out early. It's been an awesome week. 

 Q. Seems like you've always been tense on the course and you talked about fun; how important an ingredient was that?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm sure it's a big element but you always have fun when you play better, too, so it goes hand in hand. 
 We played some great golf early on and yesterday the Europeans threw some great golf to us and I know Robert Karlsson birdied seven out of the first ten holes -- and even though the Europeans threw all they had at us like yesterday, they were only able to get one of the three points and I think that gave us a lot of momentum going into singles to know that we were going to get this done. 

 Q. As one of the leaders of this country's team, how does it feel to have you stand back with the victory? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It feels great to win this event. We've had a great week here in Kentucky. We've had fun playing well, playing well together, hanging together, and obviously we have had fun in the past even though we haven't won, but we certainly have had a lot more fun this week when we have been playing well and ultimately winning. 

 Q. Talk about Azinger. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think Zinger has been an awesome captain. It's all been fun and I've always enjoyed playing practice rounds with him and hanging with him because of his personality. He has a lot of energy and he's funny. He rips on us and builds us up. He's been very enjoyable to be around this week. We've been excited about this event for months. We've been talking about this actually over almost a year now, but with the points shaping out last three or four months, we have had a lot of conversation that it's been great to see that. 
 He's made some great choices with the picks. We've had some incredible play out of our picks. J.B. Holmes to birdie 16 and 17 ultimately winning the Cup and when we needed one more point knowing it looked like Furyk was going to close out his match, that was great.
