PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it wasn't the greatest round today.  I got off to a poor start bogeying those four holes in a row.  I hung in there, had some chances to make birdies, birdied two par 5s on the back.  I struggled on the greens, never really had any putts go in and was unable to get it back to even.

I've got two more rounds, and these next two rounds I'll use as a chance to kind of get my game sharp hopefully for the British because this is my last two competitive rounds until I tee off Thursday at the British.
Q.  How low do you think you'll have to shoot tomorrow?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably 7  or 8 under par, I think.  The greens are firming up so the scores won't be as low.  They were pretty firm today, and it was hard to get the ball close on a lot of the holes, even though we had short irons in.  Very tough to get it close.  I think if I can shoot 7  or 8 under par tomorrow, I'll probably be within four or five of the lead.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, because there's a lot of holes left.  You don't want to let a few holes affect the rest of the round.  I was able to hit    I just tried to make some pars, get a couple of pars and then try to make some birdies in.  9, 10, those were two holes, 9, 10, 11, those are the holes you need to take advantage of.  Those are the three birdie holes, and I only birdied 11.  I had chances on 9 and 10 and I didn't, and that could have gotten the round turned around, but it just didn't happen.

I'll get off tomorrow early unfortunately, but early with some good greens and see if I can make some birdies.
Q.  Talk about how you played 14.
PHIL MICKELSON:  That's a tricky hole.  I've been going a little bit shorter off the tee there if I'm not able to reach it, lay up kind of short left and have that nice chip right up the green and unfortunately didn't get it up and down there the last couple times.
Q.  What was going wrong today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Nothing in particular, just three putt one green and drove it in the hazard next hole and missed a six footer for par on the following.  Things kind of didn't go my way at all.
Q.  What was it like playing with Stewart today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it certainly made my round look a lot worse than it was.  The guy shot 29 on the front nine.  I'm happy to see him playing well because we need Stewart Cink on our Ryder Cup team.  He's one of our best players.  He needs to have a good week for not just himself but for the team because we really want him on that team.
Q.  Did you find it frustrating out there?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't find it frustrating.  I enjoyed playing here.  We had great weather, great golf course.  I just didn't play the way I wanted to, but again, we've got two more rounds.
