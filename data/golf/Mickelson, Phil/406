 Q.   Another of those that had a marathon day on Friday, how would you assess your performance?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was not as easy as some of the guys made it look, I didn't think.   I thought with the wind up, it was playing fairly tough and the greens were quick, but they were perfect.   If you get hot point would you teller, you can make from a long distance, because they were rolling so true.  
But with the wind up today, I thought it was fairly difficult.   The hard holes played really hard.   Although there's some birdie holes, it's not‑‑ I didn't think it was that easy, but the scores were quite low.  
   
 Q.   Liberty National, hosting a PGA TOUR event for the second time, how much did the familiarity, or lack of, affect your approach?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I think more than familiarity, it's how much you like the golf course.   I love this golf course.   I think it's very well done, and without the rough, it plays‑‑ I would equate it to like Augusta National.   
If Augusta had rough and 24‑yard wide fairways, I don't think it would be a very fun or great golf course, and you have the same criticism you have here in '09.   Now with the rough and a first cut, I think the subtleties and nuances of the golf course are coming out and it's spectacular.  
   
 Q.   Work to do on the weekend, what's the state of your game to make that charge?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's close.   I've gotten better each day.   I was not playing well coming in here and kind of keyed in on something in the practice rounds, and it's slowly gotten better.     
I'm hitting a lot more good shots and fewer bad shots, but I'm still not quite dialed in and the putter has been just a little bit off, the speed, especially.   But I just haven't quite felt great with it, because if you feel good on these greens, you're going to make a lot of putts.   
   
 Q.   How do you handle the mental exhaustion of playing all these holes today?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I like playing a lot of holes like this, because if you got hot, if you get in a good rhythm, if you start feeling good about your game, you're able to take advantage of     that and have more holes to do it but if you don't, you fight it a little bit throughout the day.   
So if you get hot, you can get nice momentum.   I struggled, I was in and out.   I felt good for a while.   I was in and out of my game and ended up just being a couple under.  
   
 Q.   Just curious about the hour in between, was that difficult?   Did you cool down at all or stay loose?   How did you handle that?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, because we were playing off of 10, you have to plan on a 15‑minute ride out, so we only had about 40, 45 minutes.   So you just kind of grab something quick to eat, work a few things on the range of putting green that you want before the next round.
