 Q.   Is that best described as an up‑and‑down round?   
    PHIL MICKELSON:   I played a very good front nine, and a little sloppy on the back, but it's okay.   I'm in position where a good round tomorrow will give me a good chance on Sunday.   
    It's disappointing finishing with double, but I played pretty well for the most part throughout the first 12, 13 holes.   I just played a little sloppy coming in.  
   
 Q.   31 out with two eagles, you must have been thinking this could have been really, really low?  
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it's a course, you hit some good shots, you can make some birdies, and the par 5s were certainly doable.   I let two birdies slide on the back on the par 5s.   I didn't capitalise there.   Gave a few back.   
    But I played pretty well today with the exception of a few loose swings here and there coming in.   
   
 Q.   So you're clearly happy with your game and feel you have every chance going into the weekend?   
    PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I do feel pretty good about my game.   I feel like I've been hitting some good shots.   
    I'll have to come out tomorrow and play aggressive.   I'll have to get a hot round.   Oosthuizen is playing quite good and there's a number of guys right there.   It's out there.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel there's a low score to be made?  
    PHIL MICKELSON:   There really is.   I think there's something in the low 60s that should be out there and I'll have two good chances to try and get it.
