THE MODERATOR:  Questions.
Q.  Phil, can you describe the round.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I bogeyed my 1st hole, but thereafter I had five birdies, and it was a pretty good day.  I still felt like there were a number of holes I left some shots out there, hit some poor shots.  I was able to get up and down.  I made a lot of good par saves.  Kept the round at 4 under.

I need to go low this weekend, but at least I gave myself a chance.
Q.  How much are you enjoying this course out here?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, we love playing this golf course.  It's terrific.  We love coming to the DC area.  My family loves it, too.  There's so many great things to go see.

So we're having a fun week.  I just need to play a little bit better.
Q.  Could you have ever imagined the cut line at Congressional par or 1 under?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't think we thought it was going to ply like this, have even or 1 under be the cut.  It's playing as easy as it can because the softness of the greens and guys have been able to attack the pins.  But this still is such a treat to be able to play such a great golf course.
Q.  How much is a course that has hosted a US Open in the past help you prepare for a US Open week?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it certainly is going to be helpful to play such a challenging test of golf.  But I think the great thing about this is the more rounds we get out here at Congressional before the 2011 US Open, we'll still remember some shots, some putts we hit on these greens that will carry over into the performance in 2011.
Q.  You mentioned it's important to go low.  How important is it to remember to be patient around this kind of a course?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Being patient is a good point.  It is a golf course that if you're not patient will come up and bite you pretty quick.  And I was fortunate that even though I felt I may have left a few out there, I was patient throughout the day, ended up birdieing two of the last three to close out at 4 under.  You can see you can shoot a good score out here if you are patient.
Q.  Were the morning greens rolling more to your liking?
PHIL MICKELSON:  They were rolling very true.  I was able to make a number of putts for par saves as well as a couple of birdies.
Q.  Good to get back in contention?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it was a good round for me to get back in it.  But I still will need a 6 , 7 , 8 under par round heading into the weekend.  I thought I had a good chance of having that today, let a few shots slide.  I was able to shoot low enough where if I could get that hot round, that hot 6 , 7 under par round, I'll be able to get back up on top of the leaderboard.
