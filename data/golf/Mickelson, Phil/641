  Second Round 71 (-4) 140 Total.

 Q. Conditions today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: There was a little wind earlier, so maybe it was a little more difficult. 
 But there was still a lot of birdies out there; that if you hit some good shots you could make birdies and if you didn't hit good shots, you were going to make some bogeys.

 Q. How did you find it today?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Very enjoyable. I thought the golf course was very enjoyable. I let a few shots go coming down the stretch. I probably turned a 67 or 68 into a 71. But it wasn't -- it wasn't a bad day by any means.
