 Q. Just one of those days, a little frustrating, couldn't get anything going early. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was a tough day for me scoring. I kind off to a poor start. Kind of turned around with birdies on 7 and 8, I thought I could really get a good round going, and 10 killed me. I had 5-iron in there, and if I just missed it left of the pin I should make 4. Instead I hit it in the bunker and make 7. That was where the turning point was. I felt like I tripled a hole and just didn't get it going from there.

 Q. Thoughts going into tomorrow now?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm not really in contention to win, but I'm going to try to get out tomorrow and play a good round and carry a little bit of momentum for next week. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's disappointing to play that round. I was playing much better than that. Again, I just got off to a poor start. I missed birdie putts on 1, 2 and 5 that were very makable. Bogeyed 4 after hitting the pin on my third, and I just didn't get it going. I thought with birdies on 7 and 8 I'd get it turned around. My back nine I could go shoot 2-, 3-, 4-under, get right back in the mix, and 10 was the one that killed me.
