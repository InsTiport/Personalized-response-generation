  PHIL MICKELSON:   I played really well today.   So it was one of those days where I probably didn't get the score out of it that I should have, but I played really well, and have a lot of confidence heading into tomorrow that when we see a little bit different course, a little bit more receptive greens, I think that I'll be able to turn that 1‑under into something quite a bit lower. 

Q.   It can get away from you out here if you're not paying attention?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, every shot requires full attention because the penalty for a miss is quite severe.   The greens are very firm; this afternoon they were.   There's no place to land it short, so you've got to just bring it in high and soft, and they are very challenging.   But yet the scores were low.   So it's out there.   There's some low scoring out there. 

Q.   Can you talk about the importance of the local knowledge aspect here, what it means to you or to what you've been able to impart, and J.J. Killeen, playing practice rounds with him?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I'm not sure how much local knowledge is required here or whatnot.   You have to just execute.   There's really not a way to miss your way around this course, like, say, Augusta, where you can miss in the right spot and still salvage pars.
Here if you miss shots, even if you're in the right spot, you're most likely not going to salvage par. 

Q.   Some of the morning guys said it is a golf course that if you are hitting it well, you really can separate yourself?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Sure.   You can separate yourself.   We won't know where everybody stacks up until after tomorrow's round because it's such a different course in the afternoon than it is in the morning.   When you get both waves, it will be interesting to see how it all settles in. 

Q.   Rory's second shot on the 8th‑‑
PHIL MICKELSON:   That was a good shot he hit there.   He hit an even better one on 12 that was exceptional.   I didn't know if that was possible to get up‑and‑down.   He hit a phenomenal shot to about seven feet and made it.   He has a tremendous short game.   I mean, you can't play and score as well as he does without having a great short game, and he does.
