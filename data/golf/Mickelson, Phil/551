Q.   Phil, 2â€‘under par, 70 today.   Can we just get comments on your round? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a beautiful day.   I don't know if I've ever seen such a more perfect day than we had today for these golf courses.   It was spectacular to play this.   This is the best condition I've ever seen the golf course and best weather we've ever had.   It was fabulous.

Q.   Talk about you and Skip, how you played out there? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   We had a good time.   Made a few birdies and let a few go.   There were a lot of good scores out there because there was no wind.   We hung for a while. 
We're a few under par.   We have a good chance to win if we get hot tomorrow.

Q.   It looked like it was a good round, but it could have been really good.   You had, 2, 3, 4, 17, 18.   There were a lot of chances out there today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, there were a lot I let go.   The greens were perfect.   They rolled so good, and that's why it was disappointing to let some of those go.   I've been putting really well lately, and I expected to make some of those.   Shot a couple under par round, but it could have been a lot better.
