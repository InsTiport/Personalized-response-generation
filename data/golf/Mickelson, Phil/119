 Q.  This match had a lot of ebb and flow.  How would you describe it?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It was interesting.  We played some good golf.  We were 4-under through ten in some difficult conditions and we were only 1-up.  They had a stretch there where they won four holes and it was just back and forth.  It's too bad we both bogeyed the last hole because we had some good going today.   
 Q.  You said yesterday, playing with Phil, when the chips get down, he's such a great grinder.  Do you feel like that was seen by him today, and did you have that, as well, that mentality?  
KEVIN KISNER: Yeah, he was my partner in my first Presidents Cup match, something I'll always remember.  He was the epitome of class and partner, and I just can't thank him enough.  He carried me around all day.   
 Q.  On the first tee, you took a selfie with the Presidents.  Was that an impulse decision or did you have that planned?  
PHIL MICKELSON: How can you not do that when you have three of our Presidents?  And their presence really means a lot to this event.  That's what it's about.  It's the Presidents Cup.  And for those three to come here and be a part of it was very special, and I just took advantage of the opportunity.   
 Q.  Will it be in a frame?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm so bad at selfies, I didn't get myself in the selfie.
