 Q.   How did you keep your emotions in check?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   We were just so ready to get on the first tee and you could see in the morning he went off 2 1/2 hours, he was just really fired up.   
He played some of the best golf and to be his partner was an awesome experience.   I love, love playing with this man.   He's just so fun, loves the game and plays with such excitement and man, can he roll the rock.
