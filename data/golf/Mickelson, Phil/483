Q.   Thoughts being paired with Keegan? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm really excited to play with Keegan.   We have been wanting to play together for a while. 
We have a very difficult match against Luke and Sergio.   Luke has I don't think ever lost in foursomes and we are hopefully going to change that.   But we are really excited about the matchup tomorrow and we are excited to get the matches started.

Q.   Do you see any similarities being paired with Keegan like you were with Anthony Kim, the rookie/veteran deal? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, his energy gets me excited and helps me stay focused on the next shot and get up for the match.

Q.   How important are Chicago fans going to be? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Chicago fans are going to be a big part of our success if we are going to come out on top and regain the Cup, because we need their momentum.   We need their energy to get us to play our best golf and we need to play our best golf to beat a very tough European Team. 

Q.   Did you guys practice in this format in the practice rounds? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, we have practiced foursomes in the practice rounds, and have a pretty good game plan of how we are going to play the course.
