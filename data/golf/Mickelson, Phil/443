Q.   What did you get out of round today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I had a lot of fun today because I got off the a quick start, and after 4 holes I felt the pressure of having an opportunity to win.   It was a fun feeling.   I love playing well here.   Unfortunately, I didn't do much after that, after that start on the first four holes.
I knew it was going to be a shoot-out and I was going to have to keep going and I couldn't keep pace.   I hit a lot of good shots today.   I had numerous putts that came off the edge.   Even though I didn't make a lot of putts today, I felt good with the putter, was rolling off the face nice, had the right speed.   It was on the right line that I wanted, but I didn't read them all correctly.   I didn't get it to go in.   But, I really had a fun day today.   I had a fun week in Houston.   As the week went on, I felt like my game got better.

Q.   What clicked on first four holes?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I just hit it really close.   Two feet on the first, hopefully.   Made a good putt on 3 from 25 feet.   I hit it 3 feet and missed a 15-foot eagle putt on 4.   I just hit it really close.

Q.   Phil, your putting grip changed.   It seems to be working.
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'll go back and forth because again the claw grip, what it does is gets me in a better address position where I get rid of too much forward press.   I want a little bit but not as much as I've been getting.   As long as I can stay in that same address position with the regular grip, I would prefer to do that, but I'll have to go back and forth as my tendency is to continue to get a little too much forward press.   With the claw grip, my hands stay a little bit higher.
