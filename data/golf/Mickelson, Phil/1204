Q.  Can you talk about your round today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't play as well as I'd like.  I had trouble making birdies.  I only had two.  I felt like I did a good job keeping it around par because I did not hit very many greens today.  Justin played very well, and after a rocky start for him the first two holes, he really turned it on with three birdies in a row early and played an excellent round to shoot 5-under. 

The greens were so firm that it was very difficult to get the ball close to the hole, and it's going to be imperative tomorrow to make a lot of 15 foot putts.  So the goal for me is to get off to a quick start and make a couple of putts and keep the momentum going throughout the round.  But the first 4, 5, 6 holes are going to be the most critical.

Q.  Kind of a bunch deal, it's not necessarily going to be you and Justin?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, there's a lot of guys in there.  Justin has pulled away pretty good to give himself a three-shot lead.  There are about five or six guys within striking distance, but if Justin plays a solid round it's going to take a very good round to go catch him.
