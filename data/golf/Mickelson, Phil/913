  Q.  How would you evaluate how you played this week?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Oh, not so great.   
  
  Q.  Can you put your finger on why?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Not really.   
  
  Q.  If you had to give your year a grade, what would it be?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's hard for me to grade my year because I've had such highs and such lows.  I had a great performance in Boston, THE PLAYERS Championship and AT & T, those three wins.  I game close at two other events, at the Scottish and LA, but then I had a bunch of other missed cuts and erratic play.  But it was an inconsistent year and it's something I'm going to address in the offseason, is try to get back to be a little more consistent and having opportunities to win.   
  
  Q.  Schedule after The Presidents Cup?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm scheduled to play over in Singapore and China for the first time, so I'm looking forward to going overseas, and then I'll have about two and a half, three months off after that.   
  
  Q.  Now that the Cup is done, at least the first one, what are your impressions of how it worked out?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  That's interesting.  I think I'll have to be fair and give it three or four years because we certainly need some adjustments here or there, and over time I'm curious to see how it irons out.  But for the most part, it was a successful first year and I think it'll continue to get better.   
  
  Q.  Did you keep an eye on where Stricker was today at all?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, not really.
