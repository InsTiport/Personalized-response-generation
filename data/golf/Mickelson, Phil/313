Q. Phil, nice finish.  I know it's been a long week this week.  But you're playing in Denver.  I don't think you're going to have the humidity.  It's going to be drier, it should be a lot of fun.PHIL MICKELSON: It should.  I've been looking forward to going back to Denver for some time since the International stopped up at Castle Pines.  I had some success there.  And I've always loved playing at that altitude and playing the golf course there. In 1990 I won the U.S. Amateur at Cherry Hills.  I haven't had a chance to really go back.  I stopped there one day, didn't get to play.  I love that golf course.  It's like one of my favorites.  I have a picture of every hole painted in my mind from 24 years ago.  And I'm so excited to go back there.Q. What great memories.  Go out there and have fun.  I don't want to keep you.  I know you want to get back to the family.PHIL MICKELSON: Yes.  I'm in no rush, since we're done so early.  But next week I'll be working on maybe a little bit later tee time.
