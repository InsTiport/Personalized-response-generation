Q.   Phil, before we get your thoughts on your play, give us your perspective on just how difficult it was out there today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was tough.   It was fun to have those conditions.   It was fun to turn back those Back 9 holes playing into the wind.   It was a real challenge.
It was tough.   It was fun.   You have to hit different kinds of shots, and I actually played pretty well.   I thought I made a couple loose swings and it cost me four shots.   I hit three poor tee shots.   It cost me four, but I fought hard all day to keep it around here.

Q.   How taxing is it mentally when any lapse in concentration is going to get punished?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, that's why it's such a good test is that it really forces you to focus on each shot, because one bad slipup, and it'll cost you one or two shots like it did me.
It is very mentally draining playing out there, because it's such a tough test, and I'm a little concerned that it's taken up a little bit more energy than I would like for next week. 
But it's also a good opportunity to focus on some of the difficult shots that we'll have next week, so it kind of goes both ways.

Q.   Just chatting to Padraig and he said the wind was affecting the ball on the greens.   Did you find that?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, undoubtedly.   I had a putt on‑‑ after I lost a ball on 16.   When you get a downhill putt that's with a direct cross wind, those are the hardest because you just don't know how much it's going to blow.   It could be‑‑ I was looking at either two inches outside, up to 14 inches outside, just depending on how strong the wind was going to affect it, and you just don't know how hard or easy you're going to hit it.   Direct cross winds are the hardest by far.

Q.   How do you feel about your position now in the championship going into the weekend?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I'm excited to have two more rounds and be within striking distance of the lead.   I really think the lead will be about 6‑under by the end of the day, and if that's the case I'm five back, and a good hot round can get me in it for Sunday and that's really the goal.
