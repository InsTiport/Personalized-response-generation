 Q. Phil, with the rain this morning, soft greens, thought people would be able to put up big numbers. You didn't have that kind of day, how come?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't drive it very well today and that's going to be my whole key. If I hit it reasonably straight I can attack a lot of holes and I hit some poor ones. I drove it in the rough on 8 and bogeyed on a hole I should be making birdie. I should have had a midâ€‘iron in there. But I just have to drive it a little bit better. If I drive like I did yesterday I'm going to have a good week.   
   
 Q. Coming into the tournament if somebody said at this point after entering the weekend you're three back, your reaction would be?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Okay. I think that I expected to be a little bit better, to be honest, but there's nothing better than having a chance going into the weekend at the Masters. And that's what I want to focus on.
