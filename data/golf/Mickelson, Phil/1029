Q.  Are you disappointed?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Sure, I'm disappointed.  I had a great chance to win the tournament.  I was right up there on top of the leaderboard after 13 holes, and the way I've been putting the last couple weeks, it kind of crept in and struggled there.

But I've been playing okay and I feel like hopefully it'll turn by next week.
Q.  What positive things do you take away from it?
PHIL MICKELSON:  The way I look at it is I had a bunch of three putts which I haven't been doing over the last couple years and made a lot of mistakes, felt pretty good with the driver and yet I lost by two.  So I look at that as a positive.  If I can just improve a little bit, I should have a chance in Phoenix.
Q.  Have you taken a penalty shot this week?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Not that I can think of.  That's a positive.
Q.  There's so many guys tied for the lead.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's an exciting tournament.  I remember when Daly won the tournament tied with Luke Donald and Chris Riley, there were four or five other guys with a chance.  It's a neat tournament to have that.
Q.  It felt like 14 was a hole that kind of stuck you a little bit.  You had 143 in.  Were you expecting more wind there?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I hit a good shot.  I missed it by 2 percent, 143 percent, missed it by three yards.  It was just a tough pin, thought I'd take a chance, and it hopped in really thick rough.  I hit a good shot to about four feet and missed it.  I don't know what to say about that.  I thought I hit a good putt, it just kind of wiggled left.  Same thing on 15 and 16.
Q.  Did that kind of carry over a little bit because you had a good shot in there?  Did that carry over into 15 and 16?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know what to say.  I thought it didn't carry over.  I thought I hit good putts, just didn't go in.
