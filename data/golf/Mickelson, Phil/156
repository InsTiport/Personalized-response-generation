Q. Your takeaway from the week?  General thoughts?
PHIL MICKELSON: I love playing here, and, you know, I played the first 63 holes really well.  I was excited, going to the back side having an opportunity to win the golf tournament with a good back 9.
Unfortunately after hitting good drives on 10, 11, I made bogeys on both of those holes.  It just killed my momentum.  I had a hard time picking it back up.
Shot 4-over the back.  It was a disappointing way to finish it, but it's very encouraging with the way I have been playing.  And the way I got myself into contention there with 9 holes to go was fun.
