Q.  Run through it real quick.
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  What would you like to know?  You've got three minutes. 
 
Q.  How was it overall, what were your --
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Today was a very easy day for the way the golf course played.  There wasn't a breath of wind, after the rain last night the greens were much softer.  The more holes you had a chance to play the luckier you were.  Unfortunately for me I didn't strike it the way I wanted to or the way I did the first day, so it played very difficult, and I was fortunate to shoot 1-under par. 
 
Q.  When you make a hole-in-one, does it make you feel like it's my time?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's a good omen. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  For what?  To win.  There is -- well, I don't know, I don't know how to answer that. 
 
Q.  Did you feel like you wanted to go to the driving range to work something out after your round was over?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, that's why I was late here.  I did not strike the ball the way I wanted to.  I've been hitting the ball well this week, and it was just a little off, and I just wanted to get it straightened away on the range. 
 
Q.  Talk about your ace.
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was 174 to the hole, I hit an 8-iron and it landed about a yard short and one or two bounced into the hole.  It was hard for me to see, though, because I was hidden by the bunker, I didn't actually see it go in. 
 
Q.  Do you think you need to be more consistent on the weekend to win than today.  Today was wildly up-and-down, wasn't it?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was more -- again, as I said earlier, I didn't strike the ball the way I wanted to. 
 
Q.  The young man you gave the ball to after your ace, how did you pick him out of the crowd?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  I was just looking for a little guy, and -- I just like to give balls away during the round, and mainly to kids.  And he was the first one that I saw.
