   PHIL MICKELSON: Played okay. Played okay this week. Just not good enough to get up and make a run. Didn't make enough birdies. But played okay.   
  
  Q. What did you do on 18?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: 5-iron off the tee again, great hole. 4-iron into the green and 2-putted.   
  
  Q. Did you feel at any time this week you were in contention?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I felt like I was one good round away, 4- or 5-under par the first three days of getting in it, but just wasn't able to do it. I just really struggled making birdies here.   
 It's very difficult to it get the ball close to a lot of the pins, other than the par 5s and I just didn't make enough 30-, 40-footers.   
  
  Q. You made the turn at 2-under; did you feel --  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, yeah. I thought if I could shoot 3-, 4-, 5-under on the back, with those tough finishing holes, you just never know what will happen.   
 Unfortunately I bogeyed 10 and it kind of derailed me and then I didn't birdie 12. I was thinking eagle on 12 and didn't get it done.   
 But I thought -- I certainly thought there was an opportunity there. It doesn't look like now it's going to matter because the scores are low, but at the time I was thinking it might.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about your game coming out of this thing?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought that I had a lot of good signs this week.
