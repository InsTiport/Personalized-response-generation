Q. Nice to finish up with a couple of birdies at the end of the round.  Just wanted to have a look at this tee shot at 18.
PHIL MICKELSON: This is just a little cut 9-iron that I think the yardage is 161, and I hit just a little bit of cut, just barely made it over, and got to about three and a half, four feet.
Q. You've got Tim fresh on the bag this week.  You guys have talked about how much fun you've been having.  What strengths has he offered as a caddie on the bag this week?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, all today I got updates on Jon Rahm's success throughout the day and how great a win he had.  Congratulations to Jon.  Tim, as you know, in addition to being my caddie, is also his manager, and so he was very keen on knowing how he was doing throughout the day.  So we were both really happy for his success.  That was a nice plus.  But he's just a fun guy to be around.  I just love being around him.  We had a great first week, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with him.
Q. You mentioned about heading over to Birkdale.  How excited are you about the Open and how much does it change the mindset heading over there having had a great round like this?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's nice to get a little bit of momentum and to finally shoot a number that I feel like I've been playing well enough to shoot, but I'm going to head over there later this week and get a few extra days in at Birkdale.  It's my first Open Championship I ever played in 1991 at Birkdale, so I have a real affinity for the golf course.  I just have a special place in my heart for it, and I'm looking forward to playing there this year.
Q. Still unfinished business with that Claret Jug for you, isn't it?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it is, however, at least I've won the event now.  For a number of years, decades even, I always wanted to win, always believed I would win, but never really broke through, so that win at Muirfield really meant a lot to me.
Q. If we can just get you to wrap up your week for us.
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it was really an impressive week from the standpoint of getting this golf course ready in less than a year, and the way the community pulled together to pull this event off.  Just really impressive, and to see what everybody here at the Greenbrier was able to do, great leadership with Governor Justice, too, it was just a special week, and it was nice for me to get a little bit of momentum here on the last day and shoot a good round.
Q. It's a number that you've been looking for for a while, that 64, giving you the momentum you spoke of going overseas?
PHIL MICKELSON: It is.  It will help.  But more than that, I came in here early, went to the Sporting Club and spent time getting my distance controls dialed in with each iron.
