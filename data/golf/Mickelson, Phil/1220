PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I scored well today.  I shot 4-under and did not make a bogey.  I was very pleased with the way I scored.  I didn't feel as though I hit it very close.  I didn't hit the best shots.  But kept it in play decent off the tee.  Had it get away from me a few holes, but I felt like I scored well.  Got in the hole.  Got up-and-down when I needed to.

Q.  You play well at this golf course.  Do you feel comfortable here?  What is it about this place? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I certainly do enjoy this golf course.  I do feel comfortable on this course.  I do feel as though I can score well here.  It's a course where it's very easy for me to be patient on because there are not any give-me birdie holes No. 2 maybe, but I have not birdied that yet this week.  There are holes that make it very difficult for the leaders to get away or to pull away, and so I feel that I can be patient and that I can make birdies throughout the 18 holes and stay with the leaders, as opposed to having to make birdies to keep pace.

Q.  Through last week your goal was still to be Player of the Year.  Now that probably is by the boards, what goal do you have now?  Money title? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I don't agree with your premise there, so  -- yeah, I think that  -- I certainly felt that way last week.  Looking at it, if I can have a good finish this week and get to No. 1 on the Money List, I think that I would have a shot. 

Q.  You're not going to play much here on out, though?

PHIL MICKELSON:   I'll play St.  Louis. 

Q.  Any scoreboard watching throughout the day?

PHIL MICKELSON:   Briefly. 

Q.  How do you feel you putted? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   I thought I putted really well today.  I made a ton of putts; that really kept me in it. 

Q.  Do you have to win here, win St.  Louis to have a chance at Player of the Year? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I don't think so.  I just  -- I think it's going to be pretty close this year.  I don't know who played better, I really don't.  I know that there's one player that's one more tournaments, but I don't know who has played better throughout the year. 

Q.  Obviously, yesterday a report came out about Fred Couples planning to design a course for men only in Arizona.  Just your comment on that? 

PHIL MICKELSON:   It's news to me.  I know nothing about it.
