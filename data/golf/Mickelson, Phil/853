  Q. Shots that weren't that bad turned out real bad for some guys for some reason?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought it played fine. I think that -- I knew today was going to be the tough day for me because I didn't have a great three days heading in. I was kind of tired and didn't get a chance to rest and get ready.   
 Now I've got an opportunity this afternoon to work on my game, tomorrow to work on my game and be ready for the last three rounds. So I was just going into this round just trying to fit and hang in there. And I hit a lot of sloppy shots, but I also hit some good ones and shot par. But I thought the course was playing very well.   
  
  Q. That was a nice group you had today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: We had a good group and we had -- again, I think everybody in our group had some up-and-downs. You know, Mike Weir started out very rough and was I think was 3-over at one point and ended up shooting under par. And Sergio and I had a chance throughout the round to get some things going. Then we made some mistakes. It was just kind of a weird day.   
 Again, there's three rounds left and I think that tomorrow will be a good day.  
  
  Q. What was 10 like first thing in the morning teeing off?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hit a good drive and a 7-iron. I think that Sergio hit about the same thing, hit drive and about a 7-iron. And it wasn't anything ridiculous.   
  
  Q. Talk about the speed of these greens.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: The speed's quick. The speed of the greens are very quick, obviously. Some putts are very tough.
