 Q.  First off, take us through what happened there on 7 today?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, I just -- I wasn't really thinking.  I just had a few bonehead moves today.  But you can move stuff on the tee box, but I've been working on this really low shot for the next two weeks, and there was some fescue in front that was low, and I stepped on it.  Right when I did, I thought, oh, my goodness, that might be a penalty.  I told my partner, and we asked Robbie the rules official, and sure enough it was.   
It was just one of those things that I wasn't really paying attention or thinking.  If we were on the tee box, no problem.  But it was just a foot in front, and it's just one of those things.  So you take your penalty and you move on.  It's happened before, not just at The Open, but a number of times.  A lot of times guys just inadvertently do things, and I just wasn't thinking.   
 Q.  Essentially you realized right away on that?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I paused before I hit, and I said that may be a penalty, we'll have to check.  Sure enough it was.  But if it were on the tee box, it would have been no problem, but it was right in front of it.   
 Q.  Speaking of different situations, was there any thought on 18 for hitting that shot, perhaps, from the other side of the grandstands?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Not really.  I don't even know what to say.  I wasn't really having my best day focus-wise.  I hit a terrible shot off the tee.   
 Q.  Overall, biggest takeaway from the week as you move ahead to the next two overseas?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I've been working on a few things you may have seen throughout the round today.  This low shot, get it on the ground quick, and that's something I'll be needing the next two weeks over there in the U.K. for the links golf.  I actually started to feel really comfortable with it.  I hit a lot of good ones, so I'm looking forward to getting over there.  I've got to get my short game a little sharper.  My iron play wasn't great, but I'm looking forward to heading over.   
 Q.  Give us an idea what your schedule's going to be like when you get to Scotland?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm going to go to Paris and play the Ryder Cup course, I'll go to Gullane and play a practice round there and Carnoustie in the next three days.  So I'll play three different courses, three different practice rounds and try to get ready for these upcoming huge events.   
 Q.  How was it playing with Lanto today, he's a rookie out here trying to find his way?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he played really well.  He's a heck of a player, he's got a lot of club head speed and played a nice round today.
