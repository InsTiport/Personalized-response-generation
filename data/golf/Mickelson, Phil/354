 Q.   I'm sure it's disappointing.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know what to say.   I don't feel bad about the game, but mentally I'm just really soft right now.   I'm having a hard time focusing on the shot.   I'm having a hard time seeing the ball go in the hole.   But the physical game doesn't feel bad.   I don't feel bad about the way I'm hitting it.   I don't feel like the misses are bad.   I haven't driven the ball this well ever, for how I feel anyways, but getting the ball to the hole, getting the shots close, getting the putts to go, I just haven't been able to do it.   So I feel like it's more of a mental issue and I'll go home and see if I can work on it.  
   
 Q.   Is the putter still a source of frustration?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't feel like I'm hitting them off line.   I don't feel like I'm hitting them with bad speed.   I'm having a hard time seeing the ball track into the hole.   I'm seeing the ball miss, and I'm missing it.   
   
 Q.   You say you're going to go home and work on the mental issue.   What can you do to do that?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Really, Alex?   
   
 Q.   Yeah, really.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   You work on focusing, you work on seeing the shot, visualizing, holding that picture while you hit the shot, seeing the ball track, trying to roll it down that track without worrying about mechanics.   It's all a mental thing.  
   
 Q.   Do you have some drills that you are set up to do exactly that?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, yeah.   
   
 Q.   I wasn't trying to be difficult, I just‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   You've been out here a long time.   You know how to visualize, how to stand behind the ball and see the shot and picture how you want it to shape, how to create the feel for that shot and then how to hold that feel throughout the shot, all those things.   You know that that's what we're doing on every shot.   It's nothing that you're not aware of, it's just that I haven't been doing it effectively.   
   
 Q.   Can you just answer when you feel like the last time you were doing it effectively?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's been a little while.   I'm not sure.   It's been a little while.  
   
 Q.   Did you anticipate keeping the schedule you talked about the other day?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, yeah, that won't change.   I'll play Memorial, Memphis, U.S. Open.   I'll have these next two weeks off.  
   
 Q.   No mechanics issues at all?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I just don't know what I would change.
