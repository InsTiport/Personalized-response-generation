 Q.  Phil, 3-under.  Just get some comments on your opening day.  
PHIL MICKELSON: You know, it was a good started.  I didn't hurt myself any, but I made a few mistakes out there that I have to clean up tomorrow.  I feel like the round should have been three or four lower.  If I can do that tomorrow I'll be right in it for the weekend.   
 Q.  The rain was coming down there for a little while.  How difficult was that?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It was wasn't really affecting the shots any because we were able to lift, clean, and place it.  We were able to move it around in the fairway, which I thought was a really good call.  As much mud as we got on te ball, the rules officials really did a good job.  And they did a good job of putting the pins in slightly high location so that we didn't have too much collection of water.   
I thought it was a really good day given the conditions.   
 Q.  First time back since 2003.  Feel good to be back?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I really like this golf course.  I love the birdie opportunities.  I love the chances to get aggressive.  I love the greens.  I putt them very well.  They have very soft movement so you feel like you can make a lot of putts.  I had a good day putting, and I think I have a really low one in me.  Hopefully it'll be tomorrow.   
 Q.  The drives at 10 and 14...  (indiscernible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: So the drive on 10 was not a bad drive.  I carried that tree; drove it down there; had a short iron in.  It just plugged and we couldn't find it of.   
The drive on 14 was atrocious and should've been out of bounds, and hit a tree and cam back and saved me probably at least one, maybe two shots.
