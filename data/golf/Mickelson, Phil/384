Q.   Talk about the last couple days. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Today despite the score was the best I hit it and the best the swing felt.   I actually feel like I have some direction heading into next week's HSBC Champions in Shanghai, and I'm looking forward to playing it.   It got progressively better.   Unfortunately the score today didn't reflect the fact that I played a lot better than the first three rounds, but I have something to build on now for next week.

Q.   Do you have any plans for the off‑season in terms of working on the swing?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes.

Q.   Ideas of what you want to do?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't do anything different anymore.   My swing is my swing, but it's just a little bit off right now, and I'll just try to get it back to where it was.

Q.   You played two rounds with Kiradech.   Are you impressed with how he's holding up under the pressure of playing on such a big stage?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I've had a chance to play with him a few times.   He's really a good player, and he hits the ball a long ways, and he's got‑‑ I think the greatest strength of his game is his hands, his ability to hit wedges and shots around the greens.   I think that's certainly a strong point, and so it doesn't surprise me seeing him play well.
