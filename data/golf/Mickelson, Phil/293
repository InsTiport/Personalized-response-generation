 Q.   Thoughts on the round?   Obviously not what you were looking for?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a good week for me.   You have to look at it in baby steps here.   I haven't played well in quite some time, so getting to 5‑under and getting in contention was a fun start to the final round, and it was a good week for me, so now I need to use this as a steppingstone to go into Doral.  
But after two missed cuts I needed to get a good, solid tournament, which I did.   I would have liked a better final round but it didn't feel like it was that bad.   In fact, it was probably the best ball‑striking round of the week for me.   
   
 Q.   Was it tough to come out and start with that 10‑foot for par?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I wanted to start in the morning.   I wanted to have a break, let the greens get nice.   I hit a terrible putt, too, which was too bad.   But I didn't mind starting with that.  
   
 Q.   What was the difference between today and yesterday?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I struck the ball probably the best in the final round but I didn't get the putts to fall.   A lot of them got up to the hole, and I thought were going to go in and didn't and then it started to add a little bit of doubt into my reads.   
But like I say, it was a good tournament for me.   It was a good start, good first step.   I'll go down to Doral and see if I can build on it.  
   
 Q.   Will you play Augusta tomorrow?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, I cancelled that.  
   
 Q.   Because of this?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, just tired.   
   
 Q.   After Doral last year, what were the significant changes would you say on that course and why is it so much harder?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I thought as far as Doral was concerned, I haven't been there yet since last year but I thought they did a good job with the re‑design as far as about 90 percent of it was exactly how they wanted it.   There were a few holes that didn't quite play the way they wanted to, so I'm hopeful that they made those little tweaks.   But I think Gil Hanse is a terrific architect and knows what he's doing, and did for the most part a really good job.  
   
 Q.   Any particular hole you remember looking at that's really different (regarding Doral).   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't think 8 played the way they wanted it to play.   I didn't think the first green played the way they wanted it to play.   But like I say, for the most part, 90, 95 percent of it, was right on.  
   
 Q.   Will you still play Seminole this afternoon?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You were concerned I think a little bit about your short game on the West Coast.   Do you feel like that's going in the right direction and what do you feel like you did going into this to work right?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Chipping was much better.   Just practice, just practice it.   The chipping was much better, and the bunkers were difficult this week because they were very fluffy and I kept coming up short.   But for the most part my short game was much better and kept me in it.
