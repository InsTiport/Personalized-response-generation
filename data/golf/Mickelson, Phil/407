  PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know.   I didn't play very well the last twoweeks.   I'm not going to worry about it.   I'm going to go home and take a few weeks off, get my short game sharp and start back up in four or fivedays for the FedExCup.   I'm not going to worry too much about it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   You know, it's a great place to host the tournament.   It's a wonderful golf course.   I have kind of an emotional bond here at Oak Hill because of the fact I played my first Ryder Cup here.   So I'll always have kind of a tie here, but I thought the community really hosted the tournament well, too.  
   
 Q.   Jim Furyk, at 43, he feels like he's reaching his prime, you said the same thing when you won the Open Championship.   You can kind of relate to that, can't you?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I see it‑‑ I've played with Jim now the last few years and I've seen some really good golf from him and I know that last year was close to being an incredible year and he didn't finish off the way he has finished tournaments all throughout his career.   He's always been a tough closer.   
I kind of expect him to play some of his best golf today.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any thoughts on Conway Farms as we get closer to BMW Championship?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Not yet, no.   I've never been there.  
   
 Q.   Why has Furyk be so good for so long?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Mentally he's really tough player, I think.   He doesn't make mistakes and he's a great putter and always has been.   He has great control of his golf swing.   He hasn't tried to change his swing to fit the mold.   He understands his swing and knows how to hit draws, fades, and control his misses.   And he's a great wedge player.   So he has a lot of strengths.   
   
 Q.   What are you going to do next?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm going to be in the air soon.   I'm going to go just work on my short game at my home, just chip and putt, and then wait four or fivedays before I start hitting balls again because I want to just kind of forget these couple of weeks where I really haven't struck it the way I had for a few months.   
I'll look at some film from those events I played well and just try to do the same thing that I was doing.  
   
 Q.   Barclays is a much different golf course.   Do you plan on hitting the driver there?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I do.   I'll have the driver in the bag the next few weeks.
