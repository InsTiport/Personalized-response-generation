 Q. When you look at your game right now obviously not where you want to be. Talk about the round a little bit. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm actually pretty pleased with a lot of areas that I feel like I've been doing well, but the one area that I'm identifying I'll spend a little time now on is putting. My speed has been off, and so my reads consequently haven't been great because I haven't matched them up. So I'll get out on the greens and spend a little bit more time for tomorrow's round as well as for the U.S. Open.

 Q. Can you take us through 18?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I hit a pretty good drive there, had 15 to the front and just chipped up there close.
