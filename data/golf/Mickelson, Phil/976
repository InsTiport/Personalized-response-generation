PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a very fun day but a very difficult day.  This afternoon we had a match we could have very well won and had to birdie the last hole to do that, but we ended up even.  The U.S. Team is excited about the way we're fighting hard and bringing it to the 18th hole.  If we can get a putt or two here or there, we can hopefully get up the board.
Q.  People are really excited about it, you're definitely in it and it's a great team you've got.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's early on obviously in the matches and the whole team is playing hard and fighting hard and bringing the matches to the 18th and doing well on the 18th hole.  Zach Johnson birdied the last three today in the afternoon to get even after being 2 down, so guys are fighting hard.  And it's a whole different attitude on this U.S. Team.
Q.  How do you think the atmosphere was out there with the crowd?  Did it help your game or not hurt your game but
PHIL MICKELSON:  We certainly can tell the difference in the applause.  We can tell what happened basically in the applause.
Q.  But it doesn't affect your game at all?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, no, no, the people have been great.
