  Q.  Entertaining in many ways out there today.  How would you describe it?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought it was a fun day.  I think obviously none of us played or scored the way we wanted to score.  But I think tomorrow we're going to have a good day.  There were a number of putts that we had that would come up to the hole and wiggle off at the end, and I think tomorrow getting off early, those will probably go in.  I think we're going to have a good day tomorrow.  It was a fun day, we just didn't score or get out of it what we wanted.   
  
  Q.  Was it disappointing starting as strong as you did?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  3-under, yeah.  I certainly made a big mistake on 9.  I mean, I hit my one real bad drive, and it was just a sloppy swing.  I felt like there was so much fairway out there, I just didn't give it the attention it needed, and I hit just a terrible shot and ended up making triple.   
 I felt like I played really well, and if I can play like that tomorrow, I think I can shoot a pretty low round and get back in it.   
  
  Q.  When you say it was fun today, in terms of the trio?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  When I say fun, I mean, we had great weather, we had great crowds.  The people here are very supportive and funny.  They had some great funny lines.  I just thought it was very entertaining and an enjoyable day.   
  
  Q.  What did you think of the marriage proposal on 18, the guy that yelled out?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm taken (laughter).   
  
  Q.  Can you talk us through your thought process on the third shot at 9?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Third shot after --   
  
  Q.  What were your options over there in the rocks or whatever it was?  We couldn't really see where you were.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought that I could just hit it along the tree line and just cut it right up by the green and have a chance to salvage a 5.  But I didn't see it -- I didn't see how it came out.  I was kind of blinded by the tree, so I don't know exactly what happened, but it didn't come out exactly the way I planned.   
  
  Q.  Vijay seemed troubled by this whole thing.  What was the deal with calling in the rules official?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I played a provisional ball for a lost ball, which you can do even if there's a hazard over there.  And there was concern a few years ago, I think Greg Norman got in trouble when he played his provisional ball when the ball was down in the hazard.  So I think he had the rule just misunderstood a little bit as though you couldn't play a provisional.  But I went ahead and played a provisional.  Once I found the ball, that was that, but they just wanted to call an official over to make sure.  I think they were just a little confused from past occurrences.   
  
  Q.  Can you tell us about the 4th hole?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  4th hole I hit a 3-wood into the bunker.  It was a tough bunker shot as far as getting it close because it was probably going to run about six to ten feet by.  But I hit a really good shot, caught the pin and went in.  It was a fun way to get the round started.   
  
  Q.  Do you think people were expecting three 65s out of you guys?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Possibly, but I think over the course of the next three rounds, I think all three of us will get that round.  It's certainly out there.  We had a lot of low scores today, and I thought that we hit enough good shots to have done that.  But we didn't quite get anything out of it today.  I think tomorrow is going to be a good day.  I think we're going to have a good day tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Did you have fun playing with Tiger and Vijay?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I enjoy playing with both of them.  Both of them are very intense and tough competitors, so it's not like it was a lot of conversation, but it was a fun day.
