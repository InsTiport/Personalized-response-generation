Q.   Obviously, this is foreign territory for you.   What went wrong? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm not sure.   I went in and had a good weekend, good final few rounds at the Hope.   I had some good days of practice and I was ready to play.   I don't know what happened, I just wasn't able to focus. 
Obviously, I made some bad swings just in the wrong spots and so forth.   But I felt like my game was ready heading in, and I don't know what to say about the score because it was pathetic.

Q.   When you say you had difficulty focusing, any idea why? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, I just wasn't‑‑ I just didn't put the ball where I wanted to and see it clearly.   I ended up making a lot of swings where I missed the ball in the wrong spot.

Q.   (Indiscernible) have you even thought about not going into the weekend? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I mean, there is an opportunity tomorrow to go really low over on the North if you play well.   I birdied 17.   I thought I had a birdie on 18, so I missed that little one there.   That would have gotten me to a point where I thought if I could have shot 6‑ or 7‑under par on the North, I'd at least get here for the weekend and build some momentum. 
But it's a little disappointing that the first round here and the first round last week has been so poor, because I felt really ready and sharper than I have in a long time starting the year.   So to shoot those numbers, I don't get it.
