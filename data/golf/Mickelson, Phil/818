  Q. Your overall thoughts opening up the event and your philosophy going in, are you looking at a chance to set the tone, or is that looking too deep; are you just trying to play?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: The whole team is ready, anxious to play. Anthony and myself have been talking about this for some time, playing together. I love that we are able to get off in the first group and get out and hit the first shots, because again, we've been wanting this day to come.   
 And so the entire team is anxious to get out and I'm glad that Anthony and are able to get out together and do it.  
  
  Q. Any experience you've been able to impart on the experience thus far and tomorrow how do you plan to do that with Anthony, or do you?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think that Captain Azinger has done a great job this year in taking away the biggest obstacle for players to play in The Ryder Cup for the first time, which is not knowing what to expect.   
 He's informed and made everybody know what to expect, who they are going to play with, and I think that the guys, whether they have played in this event or not feel very comfortable in this competition, and I think that they are ready to go.   
  
  Q. This course, talking to some players, a course that lends to aggressive play, got to score birdies in terms of the match-play format; is that the type of philosophy you're looking at, low scores?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: We set it up, or Captain Azinger set it up to force players to make a lot of birdies, and that was the goal. It wasn't going to be a course where you won a lot of holes with par, and it's worked out perfectly. We can all play aggressive. We have a very aggressive team, and so does the Europeans, and it fits both sides.  
 But you're right, you're going to have to win holes with birdies.   
  
  Q. Having a chance to meet Ali today, I don't know if you met him before or not; I've asked all the players.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's special having Muhammad Ali be here. We went to his Center Monday night and it was cool to see some of the great things he has done in his career and also for society.
