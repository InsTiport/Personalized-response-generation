  Q.  I really admire the way you brought your round back together after stumbling a little bit out of the gate.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Thank you.  It was not the start I was hoping for.  The golf course had a lot of birdies out there and we saw some low scoring, and to be 3-over through five, six holes wasn't where I wanted to be.  But I'm pleased to get it to under par, and I'm in a position where if I can get a good second round I can have a good chance on the weekend.   
  
  Q.  I remember the FBR in five, you started out of the gate a little slow with a bad drive with a fairway metal, and you went on to have a great tournament, and in fact you won.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'm glad that we can look back on that and recall that because I certainly hit a very poor tee shot yesterday that led to a bogey, and the tournament -- the round started to come back, and I'm looking forward to the second round.  I'm starting to hit it a little bit better.
