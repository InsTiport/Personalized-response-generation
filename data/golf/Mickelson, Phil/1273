Q.  General comments about your round?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I was pretty pleased that I got off to a good start and put myself in contention.  Made some quick birdies.  Five out of the first seven, and felt like I had a good shot at winning the golf tournament after that.  And I turned in 5-under, and felt like a good back side could do it.  And birdieding 11 was a good start.  I think that although I was pleased that I gave myself good opportunities today, I'm certainly disappointed with the way a finished up on.  16 is a birdie hole, and I needed to putt my lay up shot in the fairway, and I didn't do it.  And I had a poor lie and was lucky to get over the water.  A little disappointed with 6, though.  And 18, I needed to hit that fairway also, and hit the left rough and had a poor lie and was unable to advances it too far. 
 

Q.  Can you talk a little bit about that chip on 18?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  I felt like the only chance I would have to is to make par and hope that Tiger bogeys.  And I was trying to chip it in only, and it ran by the left edge.  It had a good shot.  It just ran by the left edge.  6, 2-iron. 
 

Q.  So overall, you're pleased with the week, way you were coming in, the way?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm pleased with the front nine and the fact that I had a shot at winning the tournament today when it looked like Tiger may have already run away with it.  But I'm certainly disappointed with the way I've finished.  That's happened a couple times this year, and I need to get a little tougher on the last few holes.  I'm disappointed with the way I've finished tournaments this year. 
 

Q.  One last comment.  I believe in the last five times you've been here you've finished no worse than 4th.  Can you talk about how this course suits you?
 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, this golf course has certainly been good to me.  I like it a lot.  I think it's one of the most straightforward tests of golf that we play on TOUR.  And I like the fact that it's difficult to go really low here, and that the lead tends to stay right around -- the guys tends to stay pretty bunched.  Because of that, I feel like I don't need to really go low to have a shot at winning.  Now, obviously today was different with Tiger  shooting really low yesterday.  But I think it's a little bit easier for me to just stay around the pack because I can make a bunch of pars.
