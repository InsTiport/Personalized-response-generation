  Q. Obviously you got off to a great start.
 PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah.  I don't know what to say.  It's a disappointing day.
 Q. Something that was not right as you went along in the round?
 PHIL MICKELSON:   I drove it poorly and I putted poorly.  The course couldn't be set up any better.  It's a spectacular golf course, great design, awesome setup, and I thought it was a good opportunity to score low today.  I just played terrible.
 Q. Is there anything that you can do right now to get back in a better groove for tomorrow?
 PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm 9-over.  I'll play as hard as I can tomorrow and enjoy the round.
