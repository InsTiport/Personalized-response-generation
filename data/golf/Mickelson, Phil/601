 Q. Well, you had it going there for a little bit, what happened? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, this is a frustrating finish for me because I played pretty well, and I felt like I left five or six shots out there. So it was a frustrating score. I'm going to try to regroup tonight and see if I can get out tomorrow morning and get the score that I was hoping for.

 Q. Can you explain the shot on 13, I think it was, on the par-3. What club did you use to get up to the green where it rolled off in the water? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I hit an 8-iron, middle of the green. I don't know what to say. I don't know if it's the set-up or the design, but I just don't agree with that.

 Q. The shot, when you hit it and put it in place, was that where you were trying to put it? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought the question was would it stay up on top and be by the hole or was it going to roll down in the low area? I didn't know it could possibly go in the water. I think when I design golf courses, I try not to screw the player like that. I try to keep it a little bit fair. But those things happen. 
 I don't know what I could have done differently. I was just trying to play for par there in the center of the green. I don't know what I should have done differently there, but unfortunately things happen. I've got to get it turned around tomorrow and make some birdies tomorrow.

 Q. Going out in the morning, will the calm conditions be better?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, there were some low scores out there this afternoon today, and I felt like I should have been one of them. But I'll get out here tomorrow morning and see if I can put it together. I've made some dumb mistakes too with the putter, so I'll see if I can eliminate those.

 Q. What did you hit on 4 today? Do you like that hole in general? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: What did I hit on 4? 

 Q. Yeah, how did you play today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I tried to hit driver a little further down there, and hit L-wedge just past the hole on the fringe there about 18 feet. Just ran the putter just on the high side. What do I think of it? I think it's fine.

 Q. You see 2, 7, 8s and 9s there, it's an interesting mix. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think you have that on a lot of the holes here. I think that's why it turns out to be a pretty good site to host a big event because you have such a huge discrepancy in scores there. Not just on 4, but on a lot of holes. 17 from birdie to 7, eagles on 16, there are just a lot of opportunities to make up a ton of ground on this golf course.

 Q. When you say dumb mistakes with the putter, what do you mean by that? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I came up and out of a putt on 8 from three and a half feet. I three-putted 10 running it eight feet by, which I knew the putt was quick. I eased into the putt for that four-footer on 16. I eased into that. That's three shots there. 
 I knew the chip on 2 was straight downhill down grain and I hit it too hard. It went 15 feet by. That should have been an easy up-and-down. That's four shots right there, not to mention the 2 on 13. 
 I'm disappointed with myself and my focus throughout the round today. I can do better than that.
