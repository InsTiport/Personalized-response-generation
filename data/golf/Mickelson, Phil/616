   PHIL MICKELSON: You know, yeah, I mean, it certainly helps. I missed it in spots where I could get up-and-down in spots that I knew the chip, I had a good angle, and that's why I was disappointed on 18. I tried to miss it left, I'm shooting right up the pin and it was a pretty easy shot and I didn't get it up-and-down. But I scrambled well today to stay in, but I also let four or five good birdie opportunities slide. I'm going to have to capitalize on those opportunities tomorrow if I'm going to go low.  
  
  Q. You talked earlier in the week about two drivers, but when you came out I believe you only had one driver in the bag. Why?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought I was going to need 3-iron on hole 4 and possibly 15 because the wind was in. I also was driving it really well last week and didn't want to overthink it or mess with it. So I ended up on the range this morning and just decided to go with that one.  
  
  Q. A 70, how do you assess it given these scoring conditions today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's okay, just okay. I didn't shoot myself out of it but I didn't make up ground on the field the way I wanted to, so I've got to go do it tomorrow.
