 Q.   2‑over today.   What's been wrong with your game lately?   (Laughter.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, you know, I had a good practice session.   I've been hitting the ball really well, and today I had a hard time focusing.   Mentally I wasn't sharp.   I could tell I was a little bit tired or I just wasn't able to see the shot clearly.   I wasn't able to see the putt roll clearly.   I had trouble seeing the shot chipping, and I just had a hard time mentally visualizing and seeing the shot today.   
But I'm not concerned.   I mean, my swing and game still feels very sharp.   I just need to get a little bit of rest tonight and see if I can come out tomorrow a little bit more focused and start to see a little bit clearer what I'm trying to do.  
   
 Q.   Were you tired today?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I wouldn't say that physically I was tired.   I took yesterday off, but I could tell that mentally, you know, again, it was very difficult for me to see what it was I was trying to do and see the shot clearly and be able to feel the shot and get into the nuances of striking the ball and what have you.   
Like I said, I'm not overly concerned.   I'm disappointed in the round.   I certainly didn't want to shoot over par and leave myself this far back after the first day.   But my game feels sharp.   I feel like I'm rolling the ball well.   I know I'm swinging the ball well, and tomorrow if I can just mentally see it a little clearer, I should have a good day.   
   
 Q.   6 and 7 kind of set you back.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, there again, I hit them well, I rolled them well, right on my line, but the speed was bad.   I hit the putt on 15 right through the break, too, and I just didn't quite get into the feel of the putt to be able to make it.   I had that theme throughout the day on just about every shot.   
Tonight I'll get a little bit more rest and try not to do too much and see if I can come out tomorrow a little bit more focused.  
   
 Q.   Have you found in your career that can happen in the aftermath of big wins, that it's natural to‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It does.   I am aware of it and all of‑‑ I'll try to make sure I'm a little bit more rested and sharp heading into the weekend.   But it does happen.   It's a good problem to have.   
   
 Q.   Can I get your reaction to what Inbee Park has done this year and what she might accomplish this week?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it's pretty incredible.   It's hard enough just to win one major, as I've found out throughout my career, and to win three in a row like that is just amazing.   If she's able to do it, what a great place to do it, at the home of golf at St. Andrews, if she's able to get that fourth.   
I still think the greatest feat in golf was Tiger holding all four major championships at the same time.   That's just very difficult to comprehend.   That's so strong.   And for her to do it in the same calendar year is amazing.
