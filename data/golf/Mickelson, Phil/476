 Q.   66 and a nice way to finish?  
    PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a good way to finish.   I played well today.   There were some low rounds out there as we saw with Westwood and Snedeker, there were a lot of birdies out there.   I played well and left a few out there but I made some coming in.   That birdie on 18 felt good, and looking forward to tomorrow.   There are some good players that are ahead of me but I'm within striking distance and I feel like I'm playing well enough to where I should be able to catch them hopefully.  
    I feel like I'm hitting my irons extremely well but more than that I'm driving the ball very well and putting the ball in play so I can be aggressive into the greens and I'm looking at trying to birdie‑‑ I feel aggressive on every hole where I'm trying to make birdie on every hole, and been putting myself in position to do that.   
    Tomorrow, I'll have to capitalise more and make more birdies to catch these guys, because they are pretty good.   But I feel like I'm playing well enough to do it.   
    Today, just wanted to go play a solid round and try to shoot something low to mid 60s to get myself in position for tomorrow, because Louis did not run away; where there's a number of guys that have good chance if they can have a hot round tomorrow, myself included.
