 Q. You didn't get any putts to drop. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's been a little frustrating on the greens. I putted so well last week at Houston, I expected to come out this week and kind of light it up. And I have struggled getting the right reads, I struggled getting the right speed which historically I've been able to read these greens very well. And I feel like I know the breaks on most of the putts, but I just have struggled getting it going this week. 

 Q. How fine a line is it between being on the run you were last weekend and this week?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I felt like it was right there today. I felt like there was an opportunity to do it today. But I didn't capitalize on some of the crucial holes. 
 I 3-putted 13 and didn't get it going there. 
 I hit a drive that landed a foot from carrying that bunker on 8 that would have allowed me an iron into the green and instead I'm having to wedge out. 
 And it was very close. It was there for the taking. I think guys are out there having a chance to shoot a low back nine. 
 The greens are more receptive than they have ever been. And the pin placements have been altered six to 10 feet away from the trouble more than they have in the past to where you can be more aggressive into the greens and you can get up-and-down at a much higher percentage because you have more green to work with. 

 Q. With the way the course is playing, it doesn't seem like the leaders are going to come back, how difficult a deficit is it for you tomorrow?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well I'm going to be quite a few back, but on Sunday a lot can happen. I'm not going to count myself out. I'm going to go tonight and do whatever work I need to give myself the best round, a hot round tomorrow. I've shot low scores here before, I believe I can do it again and I'm going to give myself every opportunity tomorrow to do that. 

 Q. You got those two birdies pretty quickly today on 2 and 3, was it?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah. 

 Q. And did you just feel like you were going to go forward and what happened on the score?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I felt like I needed to be patient. There was some pin placements on the front that I thought were tough. I felt the pin placement on 4, 5 and 6 were tough. I thought if I could get through those holes and then I could try to take advantage of 7, 8, and 9. 
 And I ended up bogeying 4, but still I was under par through 6, which was a good goal I thought. And then I needed to take advantage of some of the birdie holes. And I just didn't do it. 
 I made some mistakes on the back, I had an opportunity to shoot 3, 4, 5-under on the back that would have put me right there within probably five or six going into tomorrow. 
 I didn't get up-and-down on 11 from a very easy chip and 3-putted 13 which kind of took momentum away and I had sand wedge and L wedge into 14 and 17 and didn't make birdie. Those were costly. 

 Q. Score withstanding, is it still as much fun as the first time you saw it?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I love it. I loved every minute today even though the round wasn't going the way I wanted to I loved every minute of the walk. 
 And it really is a great feeling to cruise around Augusta knowing that I've won on this golf course. I mean that's just a terrific feeling having already accomplished the feat. It kind of takes some of the stress away because it's a tournament that I've dreamt about winning as a kid and to be able to know that I've done it, I think that relieves some of the pressure of wanting to win it so bad to be a part of this history. 

 Q. Was it nice to have Amy back out here?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well it's great to have Amy back and we were talking about it yesterday that this was really a big step for us because as we look back day-to-day you don't notice the progress that you make. And here we are a year and a half almost two years in and we're getting back to doing the things we normally do, which is really a good sign. So it's, it was a nice stepping stone for us.
