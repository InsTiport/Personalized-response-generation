Q.
Tell us about the day and the conditions, the wind?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I think that the staff did a really good job of making this fair with tough conditions.  I thought the pin placements were fair.  I thought having the greens be receptive made it fair, and yet it's still one of the hardest tests of golf that we have.  To get around here in under par or around par is    any player would be very pleased with it, I think.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, obviously, selfishly, I'm hoping I get in contention for tomorrow without even playing anymore, that would be great.  But I felt like I played a very good round today which was exciting for me, because I hadn't played in two weeks.  I wanted to get some momentum and start working to play well in two more weeks from now and I also wanted to give myself a chance to win here.  This is a tournament we value and I wanted to have an opportunity tomorrow.

I'm pleased with how I played in tough conditions.
Q.  The putt on 14, did you just hit it too hard or did you missead how fast that green was going to be?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably a little bit of both.  The speed on long putts wasn't as great as I would have liked today.  I hit a lot of putts like that that were four or five feet long; that one was closer to 8 or 10.  But I was able to make most of them coming back.  And that was the one that got away from me.

I had a lot of long putts today, and I think most players will.  It's tough to get close to a lot of pins.  And little mistakes like that happen.  I was fortunate, where my other mistake was the tee shot on 17, to walk away with bogey.  I'll take a bogey there, especially after just hitting in the water.  Even guys that hit the green are going to have a tough time with par to hit that slope.

It was a poor shot.  It wasn't playing ridiculously hard.  The greens are receptive.  A good solid shot will hold the green, no problem.  But that was a poor swing.  Kind of steer it, you get to that hole and you steer it a little bit.
Q.  There was mention that the green at 17 was very fast and they said you could possibly see it cutting off if you're in the wrong position?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't think you'll go in the water.  My playing partner today, Brian Davis hit one that was going a pretty good pace and it stayed up pretty good.  I don't think it will go in the water, it's hard to get it close to that hole, because of the water.
Q.  A lot of good players out there, and somebody surely will probably shoot 69 or 70.  How hard is a score like that going to be if this    if the wind keeps up?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Very.  It's going to be very tough.  Now, it's deceptive, because you watch guys on 1 and 2 make birdies, and you think they're going to get it going.  Those are two of the five easiest holes on the course right now.  The pin placement on 1 was low and right so you could get to it and make some birdies.  And 2 it was back left, which is by far the easiest pin on No. 2.

When you hit 3 through 8, that's going to be a real test and we'll get a better barometer of how the score is going to be.
