Q. Talk about the round.
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't have it. It's frustrating being out there. But it's still Augusta. I'm trying to make due. But it's just frustrating because I could be out there playing when you know you don't have a chance.

Q. How do you approach tomorrow because of that?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'll play as hard as I can, and just not worry about the results. But it's always Augusta, you always learn some things. I was taking some notes, there were some new pins there. So I'm kind of doing preparation for next year, I guess. But fortunately the weather held off. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't miserable by any means, but that start was pretty rough. I'm just hitting some pretty bad shots. I'm hitting some good ones, but hitting a lot of really bad ones.

Q. How hard is it going to be for the leaders this afternoon?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's hard to tell. The course is receptive. And I think having the wet ryegrass, it makes it easier chipping, because the ball skips through it, as opposed to when it's dry and sticky. I think the scoring will be okay. I don't think it will be too bad. 

Q. Talk about the second shot on 1, what you were dealing with under the tree?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I hit the trunk on the down swing and just whipped it. And punched out and made triple. I've made a lot of triples lately. 

Q. (No microphone.) 
PHIL MICKELSON: It was a good one. Every now and then I'll hit a shot like that and it makes it fun. The nice thing is I'll get some crystal out of it. It wasn't a total loss.

Q. What do you do with it?
PHIL MICKELSON: I keep it. 

Q. Don't you have a lot of crystal?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, but you can never have enough crystal.

Q. Do you have a big cabinet that you keep them in?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah.
