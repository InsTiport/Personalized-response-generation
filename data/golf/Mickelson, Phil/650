 Q. After three rounds now, how do you assess the course? How tough is it?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's a challenging test, but if you play well, if you play some good golf, you can score low on this course. Even though the fairways are tight and the greens are firm, the balls track very well on the greens. You can make some putts. The ball sits up on this zoysia grass probably better than any grass we play on TOUR. You get beautiful lies in the fairway and it's an enjoyable test. 
 But if you don't hit it well, and I haven't hit the greatest of shots, the penalty is very difficult to recover and salvage pars on a lot of holes because the firmness of the greens won't receive shots from the rough. A lot of holes you're not able to bounce it up, and so the penalty for a mis-hit is quite severe. 
 But I think the best players rise to the top under these conditions.

 Q. Kind of a productive Saturday, but you're not quite right up there. What is it you're lacking?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I haven't hit very many fairways, so right from the tee I'm struggling for par most of the holes, and I've been able to salvage them with some good up-and-downs here and there, but you can't attack the course unless you're hitting the fairways. 
 You saw a low score out there, you saw Nick Watney shot 63, 28 on the back, but you've got to play almost flawless golf.

 Q. I know you love college football. What's caught your eye today?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, the big game is going to be the Alabama-Arkansas game. I think both teams are very solid. I think it's going to be exciting to watch.

 Q. Are you working on anything in particular right now?
 PHIL MICKELSON: A little bit, but it doesn't feel far off. I mean, a lot of the drives I've hit have actually been pretty good. They'd be in the fairways on a lot of courses we play on TOUR, just not out here.
