  PHIL MICKELSON: This has been a great Ryder Cup in the sense that people here in Scotland have treated us very well.  People here are so nice.  I've loved playing golf here.  It's really been a pleasure to be here.Q. You must have been raring to go today?PHIL MICKELSON: Well, we were -- Keegan and I were certainly disappointed we had to sit.  We made sure that in the morning we addressed that we had to, because we were a little bit off on Friday.  Fortunately, on Friday, even when we were off, we were able to split and get a point. Saturday morning we were both on and ready to go.  Unfortunately, we didn't have that chance. Today we were hopefully putting it to good use.Q. You become cheerleader now.  There's is still hope?PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, we're never going to give up.  We have to got to get some of these matches to come around our way.  We have to win the last, I think, six matches or so.  But we've got some guys that can do it..
