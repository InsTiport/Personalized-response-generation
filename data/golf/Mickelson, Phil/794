   PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't play very well today. This is the first time I'm in contention heading into the weekend and excited about it. Obviously I've got to get things turned around. I didn't hit it very well today and hopefully I'll have a chance to hook up with Butch and see if we can get it ironed out.   
  
  Q. What was the difference today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I drove it poorly. I didn't hit very good iron shots, and I actually putted very well today. I didn't make a lot. A lot of them caught the lip, but I started them on the line I wanted with the speed. I just didn't get many to go in. So I didn't feel bad about the putting but I have some work to do on the full swing.   
  
  Q. (No mic).  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, that's fair. I didn't hit enough fairways to be able to attack the pins, and the biggest thing was my iron play, though. I hit it -- I didn't hit it good.   
  
  Q. So what's your thought, how much different do you feel at this point?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't feel bad. I just felt like it was close. I just couldn't quite get it to click. But we've got two more days.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts on Tiger coming back?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's great. And what a great event to do it, too.
