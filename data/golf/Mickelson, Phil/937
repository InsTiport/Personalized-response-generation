  Q.  Can you just talk about the past few days?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  This has been a fun few days for our family.  I obviously wish I had played better.  I didn't expect to not be here on the weekend, but we had a great couple of days.  We had a chance to spend the Fourth of July at the White House with a number of wonderful and amazing people who have done so much for the country.  And so we were very appreciative to be able to come here.   
 I love the fact that we have a golf tournament here that is being hosted by Tiger and is making a huge impact on the community here, huge impact on the military, and I just love being a part of it.   
  
  Q.  You said your wrist feels okay, but what has been the problem the last few days?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't putt very well the first day and gave a lot of shots back on the greens, and today I felt like I hit some decent shots.  But coming down the stretch, I let it go there in the end and that was too bad of a finish for me.   
 I knew I would be a little rusty heading into this week.  I knew I wasn't quite sharp.   
 It was important that I get in some competitive rounds.  I was hoping to get two more.  I'll head over and play the Scottish Open and try to get in a good competitive frame of mind for the British.   
  
  Q.  Will you beat yourself up over this or will you just go on from here?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It happens.  Guys have won majors after missing the cut.  This year I missed the cut and ended up winning AT&T the next week.  You can find it overnight.   
 But I knew coming in here I was a little rusty.  The penalty for a miss-hit shot is severe, which is great.  It's just that I wasn't really sharp and I was missing more fairways and more shots than probably the other guys.   
  
  Q.  The last three holes --   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  What do you mean?   
  
  Q.  Like when you were on 16 -- going for the flag --   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Oh, I had to make a birdie.  I had to make a birdie coming in -- well, I had to make a birdie, so you have to fire at a pin on two tough holes.   
 My big mistake, I was telling Mike Ritz, was this morning before I teed off, I had been working on this 2-iron club, and I thought it would be a good club for Carnoustie.  I thought, well, let's get a good competitive round in with it and maybe I'll use it off a few tees today.   
 I used off the fourth hole today and hit it in the rough and made my first bogey of the day.  And I had a perfect hybrid, the club that I took out into 9, and I didn't have it and I ended up not birdieing the hole.   
 Then it was a perfect hybrid for 16 and I tried to hit the 2-iron and ended up making double.  So that 2-iron is not going to make the lineup for Carnoustie.  It's out.   
  
  Q.  Looked like you had a very nice conversation with Condoleezza Rice.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'm a big fan of Secretary Rice.  I just think that she does so much for this country.  It was an incredible honor for me and my wife to have met her and to say hello today.  I met her two days ago on the 4th, and it's exciting for me because I just think that she's an incredible person.
