PHIL MICKELSON: This was a nice match today.  We had really good conditions this morning, so we were able to play the course much more aggressive.  I ended up making some birdies early on.  Marc is playing some really great golf right now.  He just won Bay Hill.  And I knew it was going to be a tough match.  Fortunately I played some of my best golf this week this match.   
 Q.  You certainly surprise us every time you play with moments of genius.  And this is probably another one of those.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, I had a little downhill lie, so I just bumped it into the hill and had just enough check there to stop it.  And was able to get that.  Marc actually gave that to me.  It was a good shot.   
 Q.  Looking forward now, how hard is it not to project in match play?  You think do this and do that?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think that's a formula for trouble.  You start jumping the gun.  You don't want to do that.  You want to stay more in the present.  I know that I'll play the winner of Kevin Ha and Bill Haas, but I don't know, nor do I even want to look at, how tomorrow would come up, because there is no tomorrow unless I play good this afternoon.   
But I've been playing good golf this afternoon, and as great of players as Kevin and Bill are, I feel like I'm playing at a level that if I can continue that it should be good.   
 Q.  The problem is always the mind?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, confidence is building as I continue to play well.
