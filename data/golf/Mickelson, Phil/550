Q.   Talk about your day.
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was an interesting day.   We had perfect weather.   Then the back nine when the weather came in, I don't know what happened, but I started to play a lot better and make some birdies. 
In the perfect conditions, I struggled.   But to play these golf courses in such great conditions either way has been a lot of fun.
