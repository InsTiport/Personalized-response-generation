 Q.  2-under today, if we can get some comments on your round.  
PHIL MICKELSON: It was an okay start.  I let a good round go.  But I'm playing much better.  I feel a lot better about my game, and it's an okay start.   
 Q.  Before you get to the round, off topic, could you describe Tiger Woods as a vice captain and as a captain?  
PHIL MICKELSON: He's a great leader because he's so meticulous and detail oriented, and guys look up to him with such respect that any time he says something, that message really resonates with them.   
 Q.  Would golf be better or worse with a shot clock?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know.   
 Q.  What's it like to be back at Medinah?  Does it seem like seven years since the Ryder Cup already?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It doesn't seem like it's been that long, but it is nice to be back.
