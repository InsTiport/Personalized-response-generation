 Q.  Just talk about the round today.  PHIL MICKELSON: It was a difficult round I thought for everyone out there with the weather and the rain.  But if you hit the ball in the fairway, you know, you could get onto the greens and take advantage of some of the other birdie holes. I saw some good rounds out there, but my short game was off today.  I let a lot of shots slide around the greens, and I've got to fix that.  That happened last week, as well.  My chipping was off, and it was certainly off this week, too.   Q.  What's your plans?  Are you heading home?  Getting ready for Farmers next week?  PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I'll go back to San Diego.  I wasn't planning to go to the Super Bowl, anyway.  I will go back to San Diego and watch.  I will maybe get even a little extra practice round in or two over at Torrey and get ready for the upcoming event.  See if I can get my short game sharp.   Q.  Obviously Tiger struggled today.  You struggling this week.  Any thoughts on...  PHIL MICKELSON: Well, next week is a course that we have both played well in the past, and hopefully we will be able to get it turned around for next week. I was very optimistic heading into this week.  I'm a little more surprised that I had such a struggle today, because I felt after yesterday's round I was going to really come out today and do something special. So this is disappointing, but I'll take this time on the weekend and see if I can get my game ready for next week.
