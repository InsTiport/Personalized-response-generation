   PHIL MICKELSON:  I scored terribly.  I scored 2-over on a course with soft greens that wasn't playing very hard.  I didn't feel like I was playing that bad.  I hit a couple of poor shots obviously.  It was more just a fact of scoring.  I missed it where I was trying to miss it and got around okay, but just every time I made a birdie, I followed it with a bogey.   
  
  Q.  There was so much talk about the course changes, the rough is up; you just hit it on the head, very receptive greens, does that sort of allow for the scores we're seeing out there today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  That's the biggest thing.  With the greens being receptive, you can attack and try to fire just about every hole.  Because the greens are all blocked in front, because there's no place to run a shot up, you have to have it like that, because otherwise you can't hold the green having to fly it on where they were firm the last few years.   
  
  Q.  Anything particular, the driver, the putter?  You sort of said you got the least out of this round you could.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, that was probably the best way to say it.  I didn't putt very well.  I didn't make very many putts.  Even though I started them on line, I didn't read them right.  I didn't get the right speed.  I just didn't make them.   
  
  Q.  What do you try to do between now and tomorrow, quick turnaround, do you go to the range?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, it doesn't feel far off.  I think I'll come out tomorrow morning and hopefully if I can get just a couple of putts to fall in, get a little momentum and have a good round tomorrow.
