   PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it's not the start that I want to the year.  I'm going to go work on it this weekend and see if I can get the putter working.  I saw improvement, I drove the ball well and hit some good iron shots, but what I didn't do well is putt.  I felt awful stroking it. 
 I'll spend the next four or five days working on putting because it doesn't get any easier over at Pebble.  The greens here are very good.  You can make a lot of putts, I just didn't do it. 

 Q.  It looked like you were having trouble with your short putts? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't feel comfortable.  I've got to get a little work done on it. 

 Q.  What exactly do you plan on working on? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Putting.  I'll spend most all my time on the greens now. 

 Q.  The rest of your game is okay? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, pretty good.  I felt like I was driving it well, had good control over it, hit some good iron shots that were the right distance over the last couple weeks and just struggled on the greens, so I'll see if I can get that straightened out for next week.
