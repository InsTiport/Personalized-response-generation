  PHIL MICKELSON:   It wasn't anywhere near as strong of winds as we've played, and I thought it was out there. 

Q.   The 18th hole has given you some grief over the first three days?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I hit two of my best shots of the day on that hole.   I just unfortunately 3‑putted it.   But, oh, well. 

Q.   You said yesterday your concern might be using a little bit too much energy ahead of next week.   Another round in the bag; how do you feel now? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know where‑‑ the two parts of that question, but I feel like each day my game has gotten a little bit better and I've hit more and more good shots and fewer bad shots, and that's a good sign. 

Q.   You're in the mix, that's really important, isn't it, going into the last day. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I need a really low round tomorrow.   It's going to have to be 8‑ or 9‑under par.   But I think it's out there and I'll be off early enough to maybe make some noise. 
But I've got to play a great front nine.   I've let some of the holes on the front nine slide by and I've got to get off to a hot start.

Q.   This is such a beast of a course that it can throw up so many surprises, can't it. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, it's certainly a challenging course.   It's surprising that a course this old is still testing the best players a couple hundred years later.
