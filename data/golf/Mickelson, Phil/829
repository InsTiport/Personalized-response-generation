  Q. How does this compare today to a U.S. Open?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's similar, very similar to what we see at Opens, normally. I thought this year's open was set up great. Even though I didn't play great, it was a terrific setup where around the greens, you were able to hit shots and still control the ball somewhat around the greens and get up-and-down.   
  
  Q. And here?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Not so much, yeah, not so much. I think that the raking of the grain of the grass away from the grain has made it very difficult. And given the fact that the greens are firm and fast, and you can't control it, you can't control your spin, it is difficult to get up-and-down. I have really struggled around the greens.  
  
  Q. When a given hole yields one birdie to the field prior to the cut, how fair is that?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, if you want me to go into, you know -- look, I've got two more rounds to go. So I've got to play this thing two more times and I don't really want to go into whether or not it's fair or what have you. Everybody's got to play it. Everybody's got to play this course.   
 I think that it gets more difficult in the afternoon, so the leaders are going to have a harder time tomorrow. As the greens get firmer or crustier and bumpier and the ball doesn't check and you can't hit it firm enough, all of the guys who are in the lead and the top half of the field will have a tougher course tomorrow afternoon.  
  
  Q. What kind of number then?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I just don't know. If they water the greens and change the pins, you know, you can shoot under par. But right now I would guess that over par would be kind of the target and I just don't know how many.   
  
  Q. Talk about the mental grind on the back nine. You had the birdie I think on 12 and then the three bogeys.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought I had made putts on 11 and 12 to get it back to even for the tournament, even for the round. Finally made one on 13, the par 3. Hit a good shot in there about six or seven feet and finally made one.   
 And then I just turned around and gave it right back on 14 and 15 with two bogeys.   
 Within four going into the weekend, there's a lot of golf left out here, and the golf course is very difficult; so I think that it won't be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground.   
  
  Q. You talked about working on the short game last time when you finished, but it seems like on the back nine there were some chips that you had some opportunities on. Can you explain some of the chips there?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I had a chance on 17. I let one go there. I should have at least had a 4- or 5-footer, I should have at least had a cut at it. I had a pretty good lie on 14, and should have at least had a little bit better look at it.  
 But the first bounce is kicking it so fast forward, that it not slowing the chip down, and it's just throwing me off a little bit and I have had a tough time getting it close.   
  
  Q. You have a high expectation I'm sure of having a stellar short game; has it not been there this week short game-wise?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's hard to say. It's hard to say. If my technique or feel is bad, or if just the shot is tough; it's hard to tell.
