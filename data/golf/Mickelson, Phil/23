Q. 68 in the more difficult afternoon conditions. Give us your assessment of that one.
PHIL MICKELSON: I thought I played really well, I probably let -- there were probably just a couple of shots that I would have liked to have gotten up-and-down from just off the edge of the green, but I fought hard, made a lot of good par putts. And with this wind it was very difficult, I had a hard time getting close to the pins, they were right there on the edges, I just had a hard time getting after them and I just didn't make a lot of birdies. But I fought hard to make some good pars and felt like I scored well and played a good round.
Q. You were saying yesterday that you feel you're playing well and you need to be patient, you need to let it come to you and not force it. How well did you do that today?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, so this was a really good day for me because I drove the ball really well and I made a lot of good putts to keep the round going and I thought it was a really good day in the two areas which I really focus on, which is driving and putting. I thought there were a lot of good things to take from it and hopefully I'll come out tomorrow and see if I can be a little bit more aggressive. I hope the course will give us a little bit more opportunities tomorrow because I feel like I'm playing well enough to do it, but in this wind I just didn't, wasn't able to make enough birdies.
Q. Pin positions out there today. Some of the guys were saying the back nine ones were really difficult?
PHIL MICKELSON: So they're just a few edges from bogey and if you misjudge it and miss your line by a yard or two it seems like you're going from birdie to bogey. So you really have to play protective on most of the holes. But coming down, like 17 and 18, yeah, you can birdie those holes, obviously. But for the most part I played what I thought was smart golf, but I wasn't playing the way I like to play, which is making a lot of birdies like on Thursday.
Q. How much better though is the game feeling this year than it was in the second half of last year?
PHIL MICKELSON: So I felt really good coming into this year, unfortunately I didn't get off to a great start my first two events in the States I ended up missing the cut, but I knew that I was playing well, but it was more of a focus and visualization and some mental things that I needed to strengthen and get stronger. And this has been a good week for me because I started off a little bit weak, did the same thing, hit a few bad shots, had some poor thought control and it got better throughout the week. So it's been a good week for me to take and build on.
