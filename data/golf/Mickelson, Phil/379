  PHIL MICKELSON:   I had a much better today, and you know, my game is very rusty, and I had a very good practice session and hit my irons a lot better today, but my short game wasn't as sharp as it was, I didn't quite putt well, so I had a couple under today.   I'm really glad I made the cut and I have a chance on these next two days, because I kind of keyed in on something, the swing started to feel much better and I really need these two days to get my game sharp to start the year.

Q.   Where does rustiness normally manifest itself in your game?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, see, I haven't played for eight weeks, so it's going to be rusty.   I practised last week in an effort to get ready, but it didn'tcome along as nicely as I would like.   And today was a good day for me in that I hit a lot of crisp, solid iron shots, and I actually think I have a good couple of rounds in me, which I didn't feel starting the day yesterday.   I was really fighting it. 
If I get a little bit hot with the putter, which I didn't have a great two days putting; but if I can get hot with the putter, I think I have a good, low round in me tomorrow.   But more than that, I need these two days of work and I need to get back out there.

Q.   How many drivers in the bag? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   That actually felt better later in the day.   Starting in the round I was afraid I was going to hook some and I just held onto it.   The back nine, I hit much better drives.   17, 18, I hit some good tee shots, and hit some good 3‑wood tee shots.   So it started to feel much better but more than that, the irons were good. 

Q.   How impressive was Rory's round? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, he played the back nine‑‑ the back nine was what was really impressive.   He played just a beautiful nine holes of golf.   But he's really striking the ball well, and his game looks extremely sharp.   His irons were better today than they were yesterday, but his driving was impeccable the first two days, and I expect him to have a good weekend.
