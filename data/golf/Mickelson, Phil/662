 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Winning a major makes the year special. I was trying to do something here. I was trying to get a little greedy and see if I could get a second one. 
 Unfortunately, it didn't play good enough golf. Had a fun week though. I really enjoyed my time here in Wisconsin. Whistling Straits is a wonderful course and I guess we're going to have some more big championship venues here and I think that's great. I think that's great.

 Q. Seems like you made a lot of news this week as well. Just kind of a wild week just in general for you?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It has been. Yeah, it has been. But I had a good day today and take a little bit of momentum from it and I'm looking forward to starting our FedExCup, our playoffs with the Barclays in a week and hopefully I'll have my game sharp and ready to play.

 Q. The medications helping you today?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I feel great. After just over two weeks of treatment I feel great. I don't feel like there's anything wrong right now. I've been fortunate so far, I just hope that it -- I still react as well as I have to the meds.

 Q. The Top-8 will be set forth end of the day. Nick and Dustin both have a real strong chance of making it there. Talk about the makeup of the team with the new guys?
 PHIL MICKELSON: We're going to have a lot of new blood on this team because I expect Watney to be on the team and Dustin to be on the team and with Jeff Overton already there and we have got other young players with Hunter Mahan and Anthony Kim even though they have some experience already, we're going to have a very young yet a young team and with Kuchar being on as well. And there's some other players that are young that I think would be very good picks too. I think Ricky Fowler would be a great pick for us. Because he's just got such a solid game that to get him in the mix right away would be great for American golf. 
 But I don't know with so much youth if that's what Pavin wants to do, I don't know. I'm not trying to lobby, I'm just saying we have a lot of good young players in America that are going to add a lot of value to the team. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, that's hopefully aways away, yeah. But let me get my game ready for some golf here: I'll think about that later. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well that was before Akron. That was before Akron because I wasn't able to really move. But after I started treatment not only have I been able to play as much golf as I want in the last ten days but I've also been able to work out and get my strength back and flexibility and so I feel terrific. I've responded quickly. The doctor said it would take two to eight weeks to get a response and it's been just over two weeks and I feel a hundred percent. I feel great. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like nothing's wrong right now. I feel normal. It's gone, I don't want to say it's gone away but all the symptoms have gone away and I feel great.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I don't know where that came from. My manager is, yeah. I'll go to China in end of October and play the WGC Shanghai and I've got some courses that I'm building over there and I'm going to do some site visits. One of them is going to open, one of them is going to break ground, so I got to be there. So that's it. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: What do you mean huge like this? 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know. I don't think so. I think the PGA's done a great job of mixing up their venues. We have had some great historic classic golf courses, Oak Hill was in 2003 and we have played Medinah a few times and they have gone to some classic golf courses as well as modern day courses, so I think that they have mixed it up quite well. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: We have got great mixture on the TOUR, I think. We have some fun courses like harbor courses that are shorter and tighter and then we have good classic courses like we played last week at Akron and long, brutal modern-day courses like the redesigned Torrey Pines and we seem to have a great mixture. Look at next week at I guess in a week at a couple weeks in Boston, TPC Boston? That's really a fun golf course to play. It doesn't just beat you up in length, but it's got a lot of fun, a drivable par-4, reachable par-5s and some fun holes. I think the TOUR has a good mixture so that it doesn't favor any one particular style of player. 

 Q. Did the questions about the No. 1 ranking do they get old at some point and then the chase for the No. 1 ranking?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, if I just can get start playing well, yeah, I think that I can get that thing done. But it just wasn't to be this week.

 Q. This round, you had a couple of great stretches there, did you start thinking about maybe delaying your flight if you had gotten to nine or ten but did you think about anything else moving to that the No. 1 ranking if you didn't quite get there because there was some scenarios that might have worked out?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't think about that, no. I told Bones on the 18th hole we said hey, let's give yourself room to the right, you don't want to be here, I said look, I'm not thinking consequences of a bad shot, I was trying to make a three, because I felt like eight might have an outside chance. So that was the last thing I was thinking about was anything other than trying to win a tournament. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: The only thing I think it has nothing to do with the golf course, I would like to see the walkways for the spectators be easier. Because I think it's the most difficult course to walk. You got great hills and mounds but there's a lot of little holes that prevent people from seeing and it could probably be better viewing and seeing that we're going to have more championships here it would be great to have better spectator viewing. I think it's terrific because it's got great risk reward, it's got, I thought the setup was great, the way they played No. 6 where they moved the tee up twice and moved the pin to the left and then moved it, I thought it was very well done. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was good to get just to play a good solid round. Because I felt like I've been playing and just letting shots slide here and there and I played a good solid round, I made a few putts, hit some solid shots in the wind and it gives me some momentum and confidence heading into upcoming events. I wish I had put together all four round here though.
