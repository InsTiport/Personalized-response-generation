  Q. Is this the breakout round you before waiting for in 2010?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: That's hard to say. It's the first round of a tournament. It was a good day. I felt like I played well and the putts that didn't go in were catching lips and I had some that did go in and it made for a good day.  
  
  Q. Talk about the three birdies in a row on 13, 14 and 15?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hit a 6-iron into 13 and actually made a 35-footer for eagle. It was a great way to kind of get the round started there. After I just caught the lip there on 11 and 12 to make that long one on 13 felt good.   
 I hit a gap wedge into 14, really didn't hit that great a shot. Hit the swale and it pulled away 40 feet but I ended up making the putt which was fun.   
 And then I 2-putted from 25 feet there on 15. So it was a little three hole stretch that made the whole round.
