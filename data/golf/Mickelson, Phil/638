 Q. Yesterday a little disappointed with your comments on the greens; did I spot a new putter? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I tried something knew. I needed to some something different to look at. I made a couple on the back but I'm still leaving a lot of shots out there. The greens are in perfect shape and they are really rolling nice and there are a number of guys that are making quite a few putts. I'm just leaving a few out there. But today on the back nine, I made three or four of them and it felt good. 

 Q. How well do you feel you're swinging? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm hitting some pretty good shots, so I'm not displeased. I'm encouraged. These are the first two rounds of the year, and I feel like I've been hitting the ball fairly well. And I just need to get a low score, because the only thing that matters is shooting a low number.

 Q. First time in the Middle East, what's your impression? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm enjoying my time. It's a very interesting place and this is really a clean, beautiful city and you feel very safe here and we have enjoyed our time.

 Q. How would you spend your afternoon? Work with Mr. Harmon or chilling out?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Because it's the start of the year I'm going to spend a little time working.
 But there's a place right across the street here, Ferrari World, I keep hearing about, so I'm going to try to stop by and see if it's open.

 Q. Will you ride the ridiculous roller coaster? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hear it's the fastest in the world. I'd like to try it.
