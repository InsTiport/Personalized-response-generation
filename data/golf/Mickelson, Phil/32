Q. Phil, welcome back to Las Vegas. Get some comments on being here this week.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, nice to be back. I really enjoy the golf course. It's fun. It's in great shape. This is a fun town. It's been a special place, so nice to finally get back.
Q. Are you at the weight you want to be at or are you going to keep losing?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm going to continue to make it a lifestyle change. I'm going to continue to eat better, eat less, work out more, just stay committed to it. It won't be as drastic or quick, but I would anticipate over the next one to two years I would continue to tick down a little bit.
Q. Have you lost any power at all?
PHIL MICKELSON: So when I first lost 25, 30 pounds I ended up not being as strong, but I've been in the gym now for the last quite a few weeks. The amount that I lift is now significantly more than it was before.
So, no. The answer is no.
Q. Is it a diet others can or should do?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know. I think that eating and working out and life-styles are very personal and everybody needs to find what's works for them. It's taken me a little while. Ultimately we all need to be accountable for our own health, and I haven't done a great job of that throughout my career. I wish I had done better. It's not too late. I'm getting after it now.
Q. What's it like to have all the major champions on a fall tournament like this? Tickets are up 60% here. A lot of big names on the course.
PHIL MICKELSON: I think having a bit of a break between the playoffs and the start of the season, having those three weeks, gets guys motivated and excited to get back playing. I think it's been a really beneficial thing for the field here in Las Vegas. It was last week in Napa as well.
Q. Did you get in some good work since Napa?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah. So obviously I missed the cut by two. It was a lot closer than it looked. I played the 8 par-5s in 4-over; usually I play them 4- or 5-under. If I do that, I'm in third place after two rounds.
It's not as big a fix. Most of the areas were okay. Just a little subtle thing here or there.
Q. After this week what will your schedule look like?
PHIL MICKELSON: Take next week off. Not going to play Houston because I'm going to Korea. Go play over there. Good chance I'm going to play China as well.
Q. From a local angle, this is a big deal this week. Also, the city's hockey team starts tonight. Do you any anything about the Golden Knights?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I know that you went to the Stanley Cup finals your first year and the town became hockey crazed. I find that a great story, so I've enjoyed pulling for the team. I'm not very hockey knowledgeable, but I do enjoy watching the playoffs and saw them do very well their first year.
Q. Have you had discussion with Tiger about Melbourne, if not in a playing capacity, going down in a different capacity?
PHIL MICKELSON: You know, we've been in contact, especially over the last few years, but nothing that I care to share.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like a chick in that regard. I don't like to share.
Q. Can I ask you one more about the fresh crop of faces, Collin Morikawa, Matthew Wolff. Who of all the young guys impresses you the most?
PHIL MICKELSON: I played with Collin Morikawa last week and he was very aggressive. Played very well and he's got a lot of game.
I think Matt Wolff is a very compelling individual. He has a lot of charisma, a unique swing. I think it's very efficient and I love it. I love the way he plays, too.
So I find him to be a player that a lot of people are going to be drawn to watch.
