   PHIL MICKELSON: I'm playing well. I got off to a good start, made three birdies. Looked like it was going to be a great round. And then it just kind of went away.

 Q. Do you care to comment on the idiot on 6 that they had to remove?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I'll let Bones and security handle that. That stuff happens.

 Q. Your misses off the tee, were they all on the right or were they sort of both sides?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't recall. I'm sure it was both sides, though. 

 Q. Will you go out and pound it out on the range?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, because I know I'm playing well. I'm playing well, even though the score doesn't show it. When I get that dialed in I hit some good shots, like the shot on 18. I'm not too worried. I just need to get in a good frame of mind and put together a good round.

 Q. Why did you practice this morning?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Why, because I wasn't going to be able to practice before Friday's round, so that was my practice session for two rounds. I wanted to get some short game work in. I hadn't spend time on this grass, which is very tight lies, so I went and spent some time there. I went and spent time on the greens because they were quick, trying to get the speed down, so I felt like it was necessary. I didn't want to do it Wednesday, I wanted to get away and just planned on having a good practice session this morning.

 Q. Did you wind up playing with Tebow yesterday?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I did, yeah. He's got a lot of club head speed, hits the ball pretty good. Not a bad player at all, and we had a good day.

 Q. Did he really shoot 80?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was probably around that. I didn't really keep score, but it was not bad. He got off to a good start, he made a bunch of pars, made a few birdies throughout the round, and his bad shots were not that bad.

 Q. The football throwing contest, who won that?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, you heard about that? Yeah, he beat me by two yards. He was on his knee, though (laughter). 

 Q. Does he play righty or lefty?
 PHIL MICKELSON: He's lefty.

 Q. He's a real lefty?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah. I let him hit my driver, and every time I use it now I remember that he used my driver because there's a big mark on the top of it, so I have a memento of the day. He's really a nice person, though, pretty good golfer. I was very impressed, actually, with his skills on the course. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he must have. 

 Q. Bones was a little jealous. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he's a big Gator fan. Bones is a big Gator fan. 
 He's a class individual, so it was a fun day.
