Q.   Just talk about your round in general. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   We had a beautiful day to play golf, and I was just a little bit off today on all little areas.   It's not the performance I would have liked, but my game doesn't feel far off.   I will come out tomorrow and try to play a good, solid round and see if I can get some momentum. 
It's so fun being in contention coming down the stretch here those last five, six holes with an opportunity to win, so it's disappointing not to play well and put myself in a good position heading into tomorrow's round, but I still always love coming here. 
The game actually feels pretty good.   You know, there are a few things I need to work on, but it doesn't feel far off and looking forward to the rest of the West Coast and rest of the year.

Q.   Your football skills, you have a very nice spiral. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   My brother, who is the ASU golf coach, brought out some ASU footballs that I signed and threw out there.   I think it's the last time I'm going to do that, because mentally I was thinking about throwing it a couple holes prior. 
You know, it took me out of my element.   I hit the worst shot imaginable on that 16th hole, and then I followed with four other terrible ones.   It was just some of the worst shots imaginable.   I just lost focus, and I think a lot of it was due to the fact that I have never done something like that on the 16th hole.   I thought it was going to be fun, and it kind of took away my focus.

Q.   Was that a sand wedge you hit at 16?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a gap wedge.   It was pathetic.   I don't even know what to say.   I don't remember ever hitting a shot like that even in practice. 
It happens, I guess (smiling).
