 Q.   So what was it about today that was most difficult?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I really enjoy playing Pebble Beach in these conditions.   I think it's really fun and it provided an opportunity for guys like myself, and some others to maybe make a move if you play well.   
I hit the ball very well today.   I hit it well all week and I'm excited about my ball striking.   This is the worst putting week I've had in a year and a half.   And I'll get that fixed, because I've been putting just terrific for the last year and a half.   
But, this was a horrific performance on the greens.   But, I'm very pleased with the way I'm driving the ball, I'm pleased with my iron play.   This has been a great week or two for me, in that I ‑‑ the parts are all there, but I haven't quite put them all together in one week.   And starting when the TOUR goes to the West Coast or goes to the East Coast, goes to Florida, that's really the run to Augusta, in my mind.   That's where you start thinking about Augusta, you start preparing for it, getting ready to head down there.   
So, it's nice to know heading into that stretch in a couple weeks, that the parts are there, I just have to put them all together.
