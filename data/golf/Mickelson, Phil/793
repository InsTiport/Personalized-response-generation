 Q. If we can just start out, how would you assess your round?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Not what I was hoping for. I thought a good round would get me back in it, and I didn't get off to the best start, but it was playing tough today, and I just didn't quite put it together. I fought hard to make a few birdies coming in to keep it at 1-over.

 Q. How did this weather affect your game?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It affected everybody the same. It was not as bad as we thought it was going to be. We thought there was going to be more wind and more rain, and it held off for the most part. We've actually had reasonable scoring conditions. 

 Q. Anything you look for tomorrow for yourself?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I'm going to go try to play a good, solid round and see if I can shoot something in the mid-60s and get some momentum heading into next week's tournament. Obviously my game has been a little rusty. I played poorly last week, and I'm playing better this week but not where I expect. I'm hoping to get one good, solid round in over 18 holes and try to take that into next week. 

 Q. Do you think you're pretty close? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It doesn't feel far off. It feels like I'm missing fairways by three or four yards here, three or four yards there. It feels like I'm just missing some putts, and it doesn't feel far off, but the score isn't what I expect. So I think hopefully one good round tomorrow can give me a little bit of confidence.
