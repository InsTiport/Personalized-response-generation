Q.   Can you just talk about the course set‑up in general? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I thought that the course set‑up was just perfect to identify the guys that are playing good and the guys who aren't   because, as difficult as this course is, the greens were receptive.   They're putting very true even though they're very fast. 
The rough was on the edge of you can get it on the green sometimes and sometimes you can't, and you've got to take some risks.   So there is a real premium to hit it in the fairway, but not a wedge out always in the rough.   I thought it was a really good set‑up.   And it identified the guys playing well. 
There is a huge discrepancy between the low scores and the high scores.   Obviously, I played terrible, and I deserved to shoot a score like this, but I felt like if I hit good shots, I could make birdies.   I didn't feel like‑‑ I thought the set‑up was great.

Q.   It's hard to ask about a four‑putt.   But can you just give us a synopsis of what happened there? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, fortunately, they didn't count the first one out on the fringe.
