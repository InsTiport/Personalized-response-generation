  Q. Phil, can you just talk about what this week meant to you.  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's a great place here. This is a wonderful tournament. The St. Jude Hospital is an incredible organization. To bring the kids out is pretty cool. The golf course is in great shape and gave me a chance to really get ready for next week's Open.   
 We have three weeks until we start our treatment schedule, and I'll have a chance to play the Open next week. We'll go on a family vacation the week after and get started.   
  
  Q. Can you elaborate on what you think you need to work on?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought my putting was pretty weak this week. It wasn't very good, and so I'll have to spend some time on that.  
  
  Q. What positive do you take from this?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought I hit the ball very well, kept it in play pretty good and hit a lot of good tee shots and iron shots. I felt tee to green, it was pretty good, but getting the ball to the hole was a difficult task. Didn't putt very well. My short game wasn't as sharp as it usually is, so I'll work on that the next few days.  
  
  Q. How is it with the kids out here?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's good to see the kids out here. What St. Jude has been doing with their scientific breakthroughs to give so many kids an opportunity at a long life is pretty neat.  
  
  Q. You mentioned mentally you weren't sure how you would react. Getting the week now under your belt as you head into next week.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I needed to get a little bit of play in, see where my game was at and get back on the golf course in a competitive frame of mind if I was going to have a chance next week. I'm looking forward to next week's U.S. Open.
