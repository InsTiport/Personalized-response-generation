 Q. You come in, what, I imagine a little late last night and you get out on the course and appeared to have it all going today. Talk about the late arrival and get-go out on the course and doing well. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, with it being an early start, I had some stuff to do back home and was able to get a good practice session in. I love playing here in Tucson, it's a special place for my heart. And I was able to make some adjustments with how far the ball was going and hit some good iron shots. But the key for me winning this match was driving it. I drove the ball well and kept it in play and didn't give any holes away. 
 My opponent is a heck of a player, but he hit two or three into the desert and ended up giving me a few holes, which ultimately was the difference. 

 Q. All in all this has been a long stretch for you. Talk about this stretch of golf and where you're at fatigue-wise or where the game is at right now. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it feels pretty good. And I'm very pleased with how I'm striking the ball and chipping and putting and so forth. But you -- but because I stayed at home two of those weeks, it doesn't feel like it's been this many. And I feel like I'm fairly rested and excited to play.

 Q. Talk about the course a little bit. This is a course as far as good second shots into the greens and good chipping and short game. And these seems to be things you practice and work hard on, talk about how that fits for your game. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: The great thing about this golf course, the greens tend to be quite ridiculous. Because of that you have to have a variety of shots around the greens. Nothing is straightforward. You have to be able to go through the air, you have to be able to spin it, run it. My short game gave me a few holes, able to chip it close.

 Q. Have fun?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's very helpful.
