  Q. First time back in a long time, just some thoughts on the week overall?
 PHIL MICKELSON:   I was really impressed with the golf course and the setup was terrific, it was a challenge and fair in every way and I enjoyed coming back.  And I saw a lot of progress this week too.
 Q. What were you most impressed with as far as your game that you felt best about?
 PHIL MICKELSON:   I would just say that, look, I made a lot of progress, in that there was a lot of difficult shots here with a lot of water and I made a lot of committed swings, and that was a plus.  I also made a lot of birdies, and that's a plus.  I obviously had a few, couple of big numbers and I'll have to clean some things up, but I'm seeing glimpses of playing the way I feel I'm capable of.
