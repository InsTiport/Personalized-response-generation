PHIL MICKELSON: THE NORTHERN TRUST, they have treated me phenomenal over the years and it's just fun to come up here.  There are some great golf courses and great architecture up here and we have a great chance to play some of these courses but the people are terrific.
Q. Excited for the weekend?
PHIL MICKELSON: I am.  I think it's going to get better as the week goes on and as I get more and more confident because I've been striking the ball well and my touch on the greens has been coming back.  I've been making some putts.  It's one of those things where I feel like as the week goes on it just gets better.
Q. I don't know the answer to this question:  Are you encouraged by the way you hit your driver today or discouraged by the bogey, bogey finish?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's disappointing to finish any round like that because you want to finish it off strong, but I drove it today the way I've been driving it.
The last few holes I missed, but nine of the first ten fairways allows me to be aggressive into the greens.  If I drive it like that, I'm going to have a great weekends and I feel like my game is getting better as each day goes on.
Q. How did the golf course change in the second round overnight?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think it changed too much, but from the afternoon, around yesterday, this morning, the greens were in a lot better shape and we were able to make a lot more putts.  I thought it played very similarly but the greens were a lot better.
Q. For you to get off to that start had to do wonders for your confidence.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was a great start.  The back nine is where you were going to make birdies.  The front nine, you had two converted par 4s, very difficult holes, and those first ten -- after that is where you can score.
