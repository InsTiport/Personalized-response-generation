Q.   Phil, obviously not what you were looking for today.   How are you assessing it?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I didn't play very well today.   Obviously disappointed bogeying the last three holes.   I would have been in striking distance.   The last three bogies hurt.   I fought hard all day without really playing well to keep it at even par and then the last three got me.
But I'll come out tomorrow and I've got to go into attack mode, see if I can get a hot hand.

Q.   Something that just wasn't clicking for you today that was yesterday a little bit or what was --
PHIL MICKELSON:   Wasn't quite on.   I didn't hit it great, didn't putt great, and, like I said, I had to fight hard to keep it around even par.
