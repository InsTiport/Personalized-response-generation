  Q. (On Rory McIlroy:)  
PHIL MICKELSON: He's striking it flawlessly and putted great on the greens. His first two rounds were very impressive.  
  
  Q. Talk about fighting back yourself today a little bit to get yourself in the mix.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was a disappointing finish with that double, but I'm still struggling. Even though I was able to shoot under par today, I was still struggling with it. Rather than go work on it, I think I'm going to try to figure out what it is I need to work on first and then get back to the range.
