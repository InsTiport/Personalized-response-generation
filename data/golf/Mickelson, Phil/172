 Q.  You just said this is why you play this game.  When you have pressure on you after playing the way you played this morning, what is going through your mind to get yourself ready for an afternoon match with Matt?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It's the best.  He is so funny, cracking jokes and telling me stories and one-liners.  He got me laughing all throughout the day.  We got in a nice flow on the back side.  It was really treat to play with him.   
 Q.  You were just saying to us the same thing, how much of a treat it was to play with him.  One of icons of the game.  The two of you get a big point for the United States.  What was it like playing with Phil today?  
MATT KUCHAR: This is like playing with my big brother.  It was such a thrill.  I have seen it do it so much from the other side as a competitor, as a friend, but seeing him just go after it.  To watch him down the stretch to go after it, he hit great shot after great shot, and I was so proud to be alongside of him.
