PHIL MICKELSON: It feels close.  I'm looking forward to the weekend and there are some low -- if you play well there are some low rounds out there.  We're seeing it, 4-, 5-under par rounds and hopefully I need to go get one of those.   
 Q.  You talk about the greens being very subtle, can you over read some of them?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It is true, but the great thing about this course is that as demanding as it is tee-to-green, when you get on the greens, it a very fair test.  They are fast.  You can easily run it by but you're not playing seven feet of break all the time trying to curl in an inside door.  You can make some putts here.  I think we're seeing that.  They are just in exceptional shape.   
 Q.  Were you thinking you would go low?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I needed to get through the back nine, and I had that double on 11.  So for me to turn at 1-over was okay, but that took a lot of momentum away.  If I could have shot par or better or under on that back side, the front nine was totally different.  You could really get on those nine holes.  You saw Rory do it, a lot of guys do it.   
 Q.  Knowing the course as well as you do, how much effect do you think the rain will have?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it should smooth things out a little bit, but sometimes it can be a little difficult swinging when the grips get wet and slippery.  I don't think this is going to make much difference, but if it starts coming down, it could be challenging.   
 Q.  How much different is it now with the rule changes that you can tap down?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Huge difference, I think.  I think with greens as fast as these are, any type of imperfection or bump or whatever is really brought out, and to be able to smooth them out and fix those, I think makes a big difference, especially inside four or five feet.  You don't really do much outside of 20 feet because you can't see them all, but I think it's really helped with the short putts and I think it's made for the afternoon rounds to have a much better or less disadvantage.
