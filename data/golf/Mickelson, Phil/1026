Q.
This was obviously the end of a frustrating day for you.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It wasn't a frustrating day.  I played great.  I was 7 under through 12 holes and I really had it going.  To finish at 5 is really disappointing.  I was thinking I could get to 9 or 10.  Instead I made some bogeys and finished with a double on the last hole, which hurt.  But I felt like I played really well and had a good day.  But I just didn't finish with the score I had hoped.
Q.  You predicted, and so did everybody else, that there would be a low score today.  You're chasing him now, and I know you've been in this situation before.  How do you approach it?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I have to shoot low tomorrow.  I have to shoot 7 or 8 under par tomorrow to have a chance on Sunday.  Again, it's out there.  It certainly was out there today.  I was 7 under going into the last hole.  But I've just got to finish it off tomorrow.
Q.  Explain your drive on No. 5.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I was lucky on 5 that my drive didn't go out of bounds, and it stayed in bounds.  I was under a tree, though, and was able to get a shot back into the rough, knocked it on the green and made bogey.
Q.  Any difference in this course from day one to day two?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, pretty comparable.  We didn't have much wind so we were able to make some birdies.  I thought the setup was very fair.  We saw a lot of guys go low, but we also saw some over par scores, too.  It's not the easiest golf course.
Q.  From 14 under, and then the cut line is at minus 1, that's a big variety of people in there.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, there really is.  If you strike it well, you can make some birdies, but it's a very penalizing course if you don't.  A lot of water.  And so we see on the back side a lot of birdies and we see a lot of bogeys.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I was trying to match his score today.  And when I had six holes left, I only needed three more birdies.  I thought I could do it.  A bogey and a double kind of derailed me there at the end.  Still, it was a good day.  I felt I played well and hit a lot of good shots.  So I'm not disappointed with that.  I just wish I had gotten a score out of it.  Doubling the last hole really hurt.
Q.  Any difference between yesterday and today for you?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I hit it a lot better today, a lot better.
