Q.   Just some thoughts on being back here. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I always enjoy coming back to Phoenix.   I lived here for 12 years.   It's where I met Amy.   It's where I've won a couple times, and the crowd and the people here create an environment that we don't see in any other golf tournament.   It's a very exciting‑‑ feels kind of like an NFL/NBA/baseball kind of crowd, and we don't get that a lot in golf.   It's a unique experience, and it's fun from a player's point of view.

Q.   Talk about the course.   How did the course play for you today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   The thing I love about TPC Scottsdale is it's risk‑reward.   You have so many opportunities to go for it, try to make birdies or eagles, but with great penalty if you don't pull the shot off because there's so much water, especially the last six, seven holes of the golf course.   It's a great course because of those opportunities to create or save shots, get shots on the lead, but also there's a lot of risk and you see guys fall back, too, and it's just a fun, exciting venue. 

Q.   TR mentioned a new driver in the bag that you apparently like. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, this RAZR Fit Xtreme is one of the hottest driver I've seen as far as keeping the spin down, easy to hit, and I just gave it a try here the other day, and I hit it significantly better than what I've been hitting.   I'm excited about having it this week, just driving the ball better.
