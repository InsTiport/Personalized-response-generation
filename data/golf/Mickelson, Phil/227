 Q.  4-under par 68 at Spy, never a bad round.  Struggled a little bit with the driver.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, like an idiot I switched drivers and today, first -- I hit a few shots that I haven't hit.  I have that Callaway's XR driver and it has some weight ports, I can slower the spin rate and I thought gosh in Phoenix, I wasn't getting as much run as I wanted, so I moved the CG a little bit more forward, and I hit some shots I didn't care for today.  So I'll go back to my other driver.   
But it's the same kind, I just had it set up a little bit differently and had been driving it so well, the best I've driven it for a long time.  And then I just made -- I made a bit of a mistake probably trying it, but if you don't have the guts to try something, how are you going to learn, how are you going to find out if it's right long-term.  But, anyway, I'm looking forward to the next couple rounds.   
 Q.  I know you didn't make a bunch of putts last week, but it seemed like you were hitting your lines awful well.  Was it better today or still the same path?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I'm not worried about putting.  I feel good with the putter.  I feel relaxed over each putt.  I feel like I'm just matching up the line and the speed, and I'm making some.  And last week was a bit of a weird anomaly where I felt like I was hitting my line with the right speed, and they weren't quite going in, they were catching lips.  But that's the game, it happens.  And sometimes they just all fall in.  So, just wasn't my week last week.  But I feel like I'm still hitting it well, playing well, putting well, and next two days hopefully will be good.   
 Q.  Four weeks in a row, are you ahead of the curve of where you expected to be or about where you thought you would be?  
PHIL MICKELSON: We'll see kind of how this week goes.  Because if I continue to get better like I think I have been, I should have a good result here.  So we'll see how these next few rounds go.   
 Q.  Did you miss this place after not playing here?  
PHIL MICKELSON: A ton.  I missed it a lot.  Especially when we get such great weather.  But even in bad weather it's great.  There's so many people here I enjoy hanging with and spending time with.  I went to dinner and had some drinks with friends that I really missed last year.  We've made it kind of a tradition every year of getting together.  So, it's more than just the golf at this tournament, it's special, and I really missed it last year.   
 Q.  Are you marking your ball differently?  Have you changed the way you mark your ball?  
PHIL MICKELSON: No, but it's got a big ugly mark on it.  Is that what you're talking about?  It's kind of a weird deal, but we had to make an oblong shape to mark something out.  We had mismarked it, and you can't have like a line, because it's a directional aid.  USGA won't allow.  So we had to make kind of a weird mark.  So this will be the last week that I have that.
