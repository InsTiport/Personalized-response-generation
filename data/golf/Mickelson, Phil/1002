PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I hit it better than I did at New Orleans.  This golf course is a lot more penalizing, though, than New Orleans.  You miss fairways, the rough is up and the greens are very difficult.
Q.  A lot of missed opportunities out there for you today, but they said there were numbers to be made in the morning today.
PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't feel like there were a lot of opportunities.  I made six birdies.  I think there were holes that I let a shot slide, but the golf course is just tough.  It's just some of the hardest greens, and when there's this much speed with this much contour, they're difficult, but everybody has got to play them, and I think that any round under par was a good round today.
Q.  How many drivers did you play today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Just one.
Q.  You didn't think you needed it for this setup?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Right.
Q.  Are you happy to walk away with the score that you are?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I'm not disappointed with 1 under par.  Even though the course is playing as easy as it can play with no wind and perfect weather, it's a tough course.  The rough is tough, the fairways are hard and balls just bounce into it, and the greens are some of the toughest we play.  I think this plays very similar to a major, very similar to the way the PGA gets set up at the end of the year, and I think anything under par is a good score.
Q.  Talk about the trouble you had on 9 with the sign.
PHIL MICKELSON:  I was trying to make it a movable obstruction.  You're supposed to be able to move that, but we had trouble doing that.
Q.  Got to work on your karate skills a little bit?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, they're okay.
Q.  Was it a sign that was just hard to get out?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I was trying to kick it to loosen it, and then the top broke.
