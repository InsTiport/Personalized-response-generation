  Q. How was it today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: The golf course is in great shape. It was a great chance for guys to work on their games. I felt like I got something done but certainly not what I wanted to do.  
  
  Q. As of right now, you look at the leaderboard, what is your approach in the last round before the Masters?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: To try to shoot a low score and get the momentum heading into next week and starting to be aggressive with some of my short irons and see if I can make a birdie.  
  
  Q. How is your confidence?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm looking forward to next week. I'm starting -- my game is totally coming around and starting to drive the ball well. I just got to put together that last bit with the putter.   
  
  Q. Phil how was the day?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was a great day, low scores out there and exciting golf. I didn't play as well as I wanted to, but it was a fun day.  
  
  Q. On 12, is that kind of how it went for you today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I haven't felt good on the greens. The greens are immaculate. They roll so good. I haven't gotten it down.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you can shoot a magical number tomorrow and make it happen?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm going to try to get a good solid round tomorrow and see if I can make some birdies and get momentum for next week's Masters.
