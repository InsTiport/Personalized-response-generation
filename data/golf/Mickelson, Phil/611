  Q. What do you think about the golf course and how it's going to play?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: This golf course is so perfectly manicured, it's really one of the best that we play. It's in great shape. I love the setup, the way the rough is. It allows for a recovery shot, and I think one of the great challenges of this golf course is the trees and the fact that it's a very tight course, and so if you hit it in the trees, the recovery shot is possible because the rough is a height that you can still hit a shot. To me I think that's the most exciting shot in golf, and I think this course will see some exciting shots because of that, and I think it's set up perfectly.   
 The greens were in great shape. Last year I was a little frustrated that I couldn't putt at some of the pins when I hit the green. I probably shouldn't have said anything, but they're really in terrific shape, and I think it's going to be a wonderful week.  
  
  Q. Talk about Arnie out here playing and just the extra vibe that that adds.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, Arnie is the king, and what he's done for the game of golf we're benefiting from now. Here we are 50 years later when he was dominating in the '60s that we're able to capitalize on what he really brought the sport to and certainly what Tiger has done for us in the last 15 years, too. But to have him out here, it means a lot, because we still look up to him as the epitome of what a golf professional should be.  
  
  Q. After the Masters, did you put it away for a little while or still working on your game hard?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I took about 14 days from not playing because I needed a little bit of a break after playing quite a bit early this year. But I'm excited about getting back into it and playing again. I love this tournament. I mean, this tournament is one of my favorites. I've played well over the years, although I haven't won it, and then we've got another big one next week.  
 A few years ago when THE PLAYERS moved back from a couple weeks before the Masters to the slot in May, it really gave the schedule a great setup for five months. We've got a big event once every four weeks or so, so it's exciting and it's fun from a player's point of view to really get our game sharp.  
  
  Q. You've got the course record for top 10 finishes here.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I came very close. It was hard to overcome McIlroy's 62 last year. That was a heck of a round in the final round. But I'm going to be trying because I've knocked on the door a few times. I really like the golf course. I've played well here. Tee to green it's one of the best that we have on TOUR. It's just beautiful the way it requires shots left to right, right to left, all around the trees. I've enjoyed playing here the last almost seven years now.   
  
  Q. You talked about all the golf you played leading into the Masters. Did you peak too early this time maybe?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm not sure. I didn't putt well at Augusta, and usually I putt those greens pretty well. I was playing well, hit a lot of good shots that week, especially after Thursday. The last two rounds I played tee to green very well. I didn't get it done on the greens. So I spent a little extra time. I saw Stockton again and spent some time with Pelz really trying to get that sharp because that's the area that I feel needs to be at its best here heading into these next four months.   
  
  Q. How is your health?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's been good. It's been good. I've been able to do all my normal activities, back working out, getting in the gym and trying to get a little bit more stamina, a little bit more strength, trying to keep up the swing speed and ball speed with some of these young guys. It's not easy, but I've been fortunate to be able to do it so far.
