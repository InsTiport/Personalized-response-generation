 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I hope so.  I think it's such the right call.  There's so much element of luck involved in you don't do that because of the amount of mud that will get on the ball as well as the inability to finish the round because of not being able to take full relief from the fairway.  There were some spots where the only relief would end up being in the rough.   
I think it was a great call.  I know it's not one that is ideal.  But unfortunately that's been the case this week because on the weekend this golf course was setup to be perfect for a major championship.  And unfortunately the rains came and just softened the course exponentially.  We're still seeing some great golf and I think playing it up provides a chance to take the luck out of deciding the champion and also provides a possibility to really go low.   
 Q.  If there is a 62 (no microphone)?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm sure that it would probably look that way, but I don't know if that would be a fair assessment.  Somebody has got to go do it first.  I really think it's out there.  Maybe I'm missing something but the greens are really rolling well.  Even as soft as they are they are, they are nothing like we get at Pebble Beach for the AT&T where you can get those soft, bumpy greens.  They are rolling perfectly.  I don't know how they did it.  It's been in immaculate shape.   
 Q.  What is your practice versus rest playing for the next three weeks?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I have not had three weeks in the summer for over two decades, and I'll take these three weeks off and be fresh and ready heading into the FedExCup.  I'll take probably the first week off and then really start to get ready.  That's a good stretch of golf of those four playoff events and the Ryder Cup.  I'm looking forward to those five events.  This is the first time where I'm excited to play all four FedExCup events.  Usually I only play three.  I'll be fresh and excited to go out in the Ryder Cup, too.   
 Q.  You haven't won since Murfield (no microphone)?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Certainly the play this year at the British tells me that I'm able to play at a high level.  I'm starting to see my game come back.  I'm starting to hit the shots again, what I'm visualizing, what I'm seeing and doing it with ease now.  I get to the first tee and I just kind of tighten up and start to force the issue and don't just go out and play.   
I have to work on that for these coming FedExCup events.  I'm excited about where my game is.   
 Q.  What about a major for Phil going forward, do you feel you can still compete?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think that Bernhard Langer at 56 or 7 was in the final group at the Masters.  That would be the one that would be probably the was most difficult because length being such a big factor, yet he's doing it in his mid-50s.  I don't know what would hold me back.  I'm starting to play some really good golf again.   
Physically I don't have any issues to worry about right now.  A lot of that is a golf swing.  A lot of that is my trainer Sean Cochran has done a good job of keeping my body in balance and preventing injury.   
We'll probably in the off season assess it a little more to try to gain a little bit more strength and speed, but for the most part I've been able to really practice and work as hard I need to to play at a high level.  I don't know what would hold me back.  It seems as though my love for the game and desire is as strong as it's ever been.  I think that this year is -- it's taken me a year to get my game back after two and a half years of really struggling.  The only thing that's missing is the final result, but it's been very close.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PHIL MICKELSON: At times.  At times.  It's been very frustrating for me when I arrive to the course and shots aren't coming off.  Trying to hit fades and it's drawing.  Ball is not starting down my intended line.  All those things have been very frustrating, but that has not been the case this year.  The ball is starting down my line.  The feel and touch is starting to come back.  I'm starting to shoot some good scores.  So I'm excited about where it's going.   
 Q.  Given that you are happy with the way you are playing, talk about your role on the Ryder Cup.  You've also got all this experience.  You may have also have guys like Stricker and Furyk maybe playing, but you are in a safe position to play?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm the third in qualifying points.  I think that I'm going to have to play some really good golf the week of the Ryder Cup if we're going to do well.  My play is what's going to be my biggest asset is that that I need to shoot some good scores and win some matches.   
 Q.  Can winning a tournament this season (no microphone)?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I wouldn't say the lack of a win this year would be a failure, but it wouldn't be a successful as I want or expect.  However, I just -- I'm optimistic heading into these next few events because I'm starting to hit shots.
