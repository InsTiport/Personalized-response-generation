 Q. Obviously you played great the whole week, a little disappointed to be where you are now?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It wasn't a good finish for me, but I played really well today. 14 holes I hit a lot of good shots, a lot of good putts. But you know, I'm turning 63s and 4s into 70s, and that's kind of what happened today. I couldn't get any putts to go in, and then in the end I made some bogeys.

 Q. Can you just kind of tell us, walk us through that, what was going on as you went along?
 PHIL MICKELSON: You know, I was disappointed I didn't birdie 14, hit a great three shots there and didn't go in. And then I was in between clubs on 15, and I hit a good -- tried to take something off a 4-iron and it went in the bunker. Tough bunker shot up the hill, and then it goes away at the hole. I almost made the putt. I thought the putt was in the middle of the hole and it got up to the lip and wavered off.
 Played 16 great. I hit a good drive, a good layup shot, a good iron shot, it spun back to six, seven feet, and that ball was tracking right in the hole and got up to the lip and it veered off and stayed on the lip. 
 And then I bogeyed 17 and 18, just bogeyed them.

 Q. Did you think you had to birdie 18 coming down the way?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought I had to birdie 17 or 18. I had to birdie one of the last two, I figured. The last three were playing, I don't want to say easy, but were birdiable, and I thought I needed to get to 11 most likely. But I knew that bogey on 17 was going to hurt. 

 Q. What was your conversation with Bones in the bunker there in the fairway on 17?
 PHIL MICKELSON: On 17? Oh, long is bad, just be careful not to take too much club and go long. I hit a sand wedge and it could have easily, if I caught it thinner, it could have easily flown well over the green, but instead it came up short of the bunker. It just wasn't that easy of a shot.

 Q. Can you talk about your decision to use driver on 17 and 18? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: What do you mean, what decision? I've hit it every day there. I mean, it would have been a poor decision to change.

 Q. Do you take positives out?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I played great, I really played well. I played great today. Again, I felt like I should have shot 63 or 64, had countless birdie opportunities from 6 to 15 feet, and then I make three bogeys on the last four holes and turn a 64 to 70. So I feel like I'm playing well, I just need to get that final piece of scoring down. 

 Q. You came in saying that you thought short game was an issue for you. Do you still feel as much of that now? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought my short game was really good, so I don't have -- I feel much better about it. I got up-and-down a bunch today and hit a lot of good wedge shots throughout the week. Again, I putted very well today, but just couldn't get them to go in.
