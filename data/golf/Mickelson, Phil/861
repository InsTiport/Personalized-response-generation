  Q. Tell us about your day today out there.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was an interesting day today. It was tough because of the wind, but I thought it was out there. There was a low round out there, and I let it slide there in the end. Unfortunately I'll have a lot of work to do on the weekend.  
  
  Q. You looked like you started to hit the ball really well on the back nine, started hitting fairways and whatnot.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hit some good shots, but the last four or five holes I made a few mistakes that lost me. I've got some work to do on the weekend, but if I can get a good low round tomorrow I should have a chance on Sunday.  
  
  Q. You've got to feel good about this golf course. This is one of those courses where even at 2-under par you feel like you can play a good round and put yourself back in contention.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think that's a good point. It's hard to pull away here. There isn't a real low round out there, but if you can get hot and shoot 6-, 7-under, you can march right up the leaderboard, and that's kind of the goal for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Were they situational mistakes, or was it just trying to do too much with a shot?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Just sloppy shots. I hit a sloppy tee shot. I tried to hit a 3-wood off 15 to just get down there so I would be able to reach it, and I hit it in the trees left. And I had a wedge in on 18, and it was an easy shot, I just hit a poor shot. I don't really have a great reason. It was a bad shot.  
  
  Q. How daunting are the finishing holes here when you need to make something happen?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, they're tough. I mean, they're tough, but it's not as though they can't be had. 18 being downwind, we were hitting wedges in, although it was a tough pin to get to. But there were still some birdies out there. I thought 16 was a birdie hole. Where they moved the tee up, you can get down there, and I had a good shot in there, but it came up a little short.   
 16 was the tough one. That's just a tough hole. I'm sorry, I meant 17.  
  
  Q. You seem extremely fit, and I know that you made some changes to your body. Have you completely adjusted, do you think, short game-wise, to your body?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think that short game has been affected. I'm hoping for a little more stamina, but the way I finished today, I don't know if I'm getting it. I'm going to have to get back in the gym.
