 Q. Are you happy with the way things went out there?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I played well to shoot 5-under par.  I thought that I played pretty good, but the course is very receptive to birdies.  We're seeing a lot of guys shooting 6-, 7- , 8-under par and I think we'll have a late charge this afternoon. 
I certainly had an opportunity to go low.  I was 6-under at the turn and played the last nine 1 over unfortunately, but I'm pleased with the way I'm playing.  I haven't really been playing well and I've hit more good shots the last few days than I have in a while.

Q.  (Inaudible). 
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it played very similar to (inaudible) and then the late wait yesterday, it really calmed down after the rain. 
The greens got softer, the wind died down and a lot of birdies were made, but the wind stayed up today so nobody really lit it up and went too low today.

Q.  You talked about you haven't really been able to get it going.  Why is that?  Do you think you're close?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I haven't played well this year, but again, I hit more good shots in these last two days.  Even though I hit a lot of wayward shots, I hit more good shots than I have in a while.

Q.  (Inaudible). 
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's okay.

Q.  Better than Olympia Fields?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't hit as many here, but it's okay.

Q.  How far was 17?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I was 38 to the front edge.
