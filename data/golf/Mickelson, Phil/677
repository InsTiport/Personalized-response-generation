  Q. A fighting performance coming home but the damage was done, you've had your fair share of problems in the past at 18, tell us about your troubles today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was you could say a couple of poor swings, but I had a little bit of -- club felt like it slipped a little bit on the first one. The second one felt a little bit better, so I just had to take a 3-wood out and aim to the right on the third.  
 Unfortunately it wasn't too bad of a day play-wise except for those two swings, those four-stroke penalties -- those four penalty strokes hurt the round quite a bit.  
  
  Q. This is a good taste of the good, old Scottish summertime at its absolute worst. How problematic and tricky was it to swing the club, and indeed, keep hold of it today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was surprisingly more difficult than today's round even though it was a lot windier yesterday, I thought it played long, the course did and it was in very good shape. If you hit good shots, the ball was stopping on the greens so you could get the ball reasonably close. There were some birdies out there.   
  
  Q. You had always planned to go to St. Andrews for a practise round, but the way things stand, will you take your suitcase with you?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm come back. I'll possible stay here through the weekend but I will drive over there. If I don't make the cut -- I wouldn't rule it out but it doesn't look good, but if it doesn't work out silent spend Saturday and Sunday over there for sure.  
  
  Q. What positives can you take from your performance?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I started to putt a little bit better today. I made some good putts and rolled the ball pretty good. I need a little work with the driver. To me I think the driver was the one club that wasn't the best, and some of my short irons can be improved, my distance control wasn't as good as I like.  
  
  Q. We heard the second drive on 18 turned out to be playable.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it was plugged in the hazard. I probably could have wedged it out a few yards and played it from there. But I was signalled that the ball was in the water so I didn't really want to walk 300 yards up and 300 yards back.  
  
  Q. So you couldn't play because you had not taken provision?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it wouldn't have mattered. The ball was in the hazard so there was nothing to take provisional for. Once I struck it, it was decided that that ball was in play.  
  
  Q. If you don't make the weekend, can you see it as a blessing in disguise?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: You always look at the positives but I wanted to play and get a couple more competitive rounds. But the plus side would be I'll have a couple extra rounds on St. Andrews.  
 I've played well weeks after missing the cut and I've played poorly. It just is what it is.   
  
  Q. Do you think with all of the world No. 1 stuff that maybe the press is a little bit off?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Maybe, I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. I'm trying to get ready for the British Open and get ready for St. Andrews, get my game sharpened and this first two days gave me the opportunity to see where it needs some work the next few days.
