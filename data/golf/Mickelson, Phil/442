 Q.   I have a quick question on 7.   On your tee shot did you just not‑‑ you didn't plan obviously on being right but you almost hit the caddies.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   What?   That's the first I've heard about it.  
   
 Q.   Because when you came up you kind of went like that to them.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   On 8?   
   
 Q.   Guan and Sandy's caddies?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Honestly I don't know what you're talking about.   On 7, they were up by the green when we hit off the tee.   
   
 Q.   Isn't that where the 8th is this way‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Are you talking about 8 and 9?   I went and said hi to those guys between 8 and 9 because my ball was in their fairway.   I just said hello.   But I didn't hit into them.   They had already finished.   The caddie in the fairway had cleared the way.   They had already been walking back to the tee box.   No, we were just saying hello.  
   
 Q.   Hypothetically, if you had signed an incorrect card‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Don't even go there.   No.   
   
 Q.   It's unusual to see you not get below 70 out here all four rounds.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I just had an off year.   I don't know what to tell you.   I played poorly.   Today was the first time that Butch and I‑‑ we had some good direction and I'll have something to work on these next two weeks before I play at Charlotte and THE PLAYERS.   But this was disappointing for me in that this is my favorite place in the world to play.   This is my favorite place to be, my favorite tournament, and one I look forward to the day after it ends.   And to perform like this is disappointing.   I'm disappointed in myself because I expect a lot more of myself, out of my game and so forth this week.  
   
 Q.   What will you work on?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I had some technical issues or fundamental issues with my swing, and I've had it the last couple months, but I believe I have the direction now to work on it, so I'll spend some time in two weekends and see if I can get it ironed out for a good run at Charlotte and THE PLAYERS?   
   
 Q.   Will you keep the Frankenwood and the jumbo grip in your bag for a while?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Most likely, yeah, most likely, but honestly it could change in a day.   Who knows.  
   
 Q.   Will you play the week before majors from now on?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I would like to.   I've got to look at that because the things I did this week to get ready I just wasn't as mentally sharp as I need to be, and I've got to find another way to get ready for big events if I'm not able to compete the week before.  
   
 Q.   13 is usually one of your favorite holes.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it is.  
   
 Q.   You ended up in the water this year?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It wasn't just 13 that I spent too much time in the water.   It was 12, it was some of the others, too.   It was just not a good performance by me this week.   It doesn't mean that this isn't my favorite place, because it is, I just played poorly.  
   
 Q.   Was the setup today one where somebody could make a run‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Unreal, yeah, somebody is going to go low today.  
   
 Q.   Why do you say that?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, the pins are in low spots, and the course is still receptive.   And the greens are still at greens you can be more aggressive at with your putter, and I think there are going to be a lot of birdies from the leaders, guys that are playing well.   You've got to hit good shots and play well, but I thought out of the four days, I thought this was actually playing the easiest.   
   
 Q.   You talked about your iron play yesterday.   Is that something you focused on this morning?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, my iron play has been off.   And like I say, I mean, I think I have the right direction to go, and hopefully these next couple of weeks I'll be able to get it ironed out.   No pun.
