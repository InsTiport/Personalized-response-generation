Q. A few lipsout I gather which might have made things a little different?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, I suppose. It was a very calm day and a great day to go low but I just didn't do it but I have two more rounds and hopefully I can get it going tomorrow. I have got to shoot low tomorrow but there is a seven or an eight under par round out there.
Q. Are you enjoying this typical Scottish weather?
PHIL MICKELSON:  You know, I come over here and people keep saying to me that the weather is not great but I've gotta tell you, it is as good as anywhere in the world.
Q. Are you hoping it is as still as this next week?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I think it doesn't matter, either way you are going to have to play very well but I wouldn't mind it blowing 25 or 30 knots but it just doesn't seem that the weather is less than perfect here in Scotland, it is always perfect, so I don't expect it to blow at all.
Q. Not quite on your game at the start?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know, it was just one of those rounds that I didn't quite get it going but there are two more rounds on Saturday and Sunday and hopefully I can get it going then?
Q. Was it just a day the golfing gods were not smiling on you?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a beautiful day and a great day for guys to go low but I just didn't do it but like I said, we have two more rounds and I am ahead of last year's pace.
Q. Golf has been turned down for the Olympics, where were you in that argument?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I wasn't really aware of what was going on, I hadn't really stayed up to date. I know that for golf to be accepted that another sport was going to have to be taken away and I'd hate to see that.
Q. Two have been dropped and not been replaced, baseball is one of them?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I haven't stayed on top of it.
