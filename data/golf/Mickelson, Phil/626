  Q. A few comments on the round today? Not done yet obviously?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: We had a beautiful day to play golf. When the storm went away, the weather cleared up and we just had beautiful weather.   
 There were some low scores. We had a fun day. We didn't play our best but we didn't play terrible to where we are, you know, shot ourselves in the foot. We are in good position tomorrow to come back out, finish the round strong and play our second round.
