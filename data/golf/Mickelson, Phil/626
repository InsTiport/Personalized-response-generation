   PHIL MICKELSON: I got off to a good start. I was a couple under, thought it was going to be a great day but gave a lot of shots back, made too many bogeys. Even par. I'll have a good chance tomorrow morning to get out and try to go low. 
 This afternoon it was tough to make some putts. Even though there were some low scores, I struggled getting the ball to go in. And I'm looking forward to tomorrow's early round. 

 Q. What do you have to do now? You can commute back and forth, but time pressure and weather and so forth --
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think so. I think I got lucky on the tee times because it's supposed to be okay in the morning and not get too bad until later so I should be fine on my commute and just need to get a few birdies there in the morning.

 Q. How do you think the course was affected by the weather today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know. We had a beautiful day. We didn't have any rain. It was nice out there. In the afternoon the wind kind of died down, it was calm, and I thought that it was a beautiful evening to play. 

 Q. With the forecast for the next few days do you think differently on a day like this, try to be more aggressive, try to make more birdies?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Not really, because we do all we can now to get 72 holes in, so if we go until Monday it's no big deal. I think we'll be able to get 72 holes.
