PHIL MICKELSON:  This is a special feeling, and reminds me of where it started for me, because the next day is when our child was born.
Q.  How closely.

Let me ask you about Annika's potential to complete the women's slam.  How closely will you be following that?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I have the week off next week, so I'll be watching it pretty intently.  I've become a big fan of hers, especially since we are now on the same team at Callaway, and we're using the same driver and the way she's been playing, I'm trying to emulate and I've had a chance to get to know her a little better, since we have been on the same team, so I'm certainly pulling for her.
Q.  Do you think this week will identify the best player?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, any week, as long as everybody plays the same golf course.  The best player for the week will certainly stand out.
Q.  I also would like to ask you about Retief Goosen's respect level.  He's a quiet guy, he doesn't get the respect he deserves, maybe.  Where do you think he should be in the game, his status?
PHIL MICKELSON:  He's one of the best players in the game, end of story.  He hits the ball a long ways, has great control.  Whether or not he wins or loses today, he is one of the best players we have in the game.  He's a two time Open champion, maybe a three time.  And from the player's point of view, we have the utmost respect for him.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  The biggest problem?  I just didn't score that well.  I had a bad nine hole stretch that kind of took me out of it.
