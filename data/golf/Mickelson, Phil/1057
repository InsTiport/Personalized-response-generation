PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I struggled there a little bit. I didn't hit it the best, even although I made seven birdies today. I managed to get it into the hole when I did have a birdie opportunity. I kept it in play okay with one or two exceptions and I was able to make a couple coming in, which was nice.

My game felt really good coming into these couple of weeks. I have Rick Smith with me and Dave Pelz. It felt sharp. We went over to  St. Andrews and had a couple of good practice rounds and a couple of good practice rounds here. I feel like it's sharp. I didn't hit it as well as I did in practice and hopefully I will improve on that in the next couple of days.

Q. What did you make of St Andrews and the changes?
PHIL MICKELSON: I thought it was incredible. I thought it was much more challenging than it's been in the past. A lot of the bunkers that had been out of play are now back in play, specifically The Beardies on 14. Those are right in the landing area now and come into play.
Q. That is next week. How important is this weekend?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's getting into contention and getting comfortable in contention. The feeling of being in contention in a Major Championship is much greater and I want to have a such to win on Sunday and I don't want it to feel foreign if and when I get into contention.
