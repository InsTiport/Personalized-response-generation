 Q.  Well played match. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, we fought hard today and unfortunately we came up a little shy.  We fought hard to stay in the match and made some eagles and birdies to keep us in the match.  It looked like on 16 and 17 we were going to take the lead but it just didn't happen.  Retief made a couple of shots there on us and 18, we didn't follow their birdie and Retief was right there if he didn't make his putt.  We came up one hole short but it was a fun, difficult, challenging match. 
 It should be an exciting weekend. 
 Unfortunately we were one hole short.  We fought hard and it looked like on 16 and 17 we might get ahead going into 18 and it just didn't happen.  Obviously we lost 18. 

 Q.  Obviously Hunter is in a different position, he's never had this experience before and yesterday, it just goes pretty fast when you're playing foursomes.  What was it like playing with him and what do you think of him as a partner? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  We had a lot of fun.  We enjoy playing with each other.  We had a good chemistry going.  He was able to hit some good shots when I wasn't, and when he hit a few that were uncharacteristic, I was able to keep us in.  We worked well together as a team. 

 Q.  Kind of like ham and egged it in San Diego, too? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I guess you're able to say that.  We were able to hang tough, even though we were not making a ton of birdies, we made enough to keep us in it. 

 Q.  There were a lot of spectacular shots today, eagles and birdies and everything like that, was the course just perfect for it today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think the setup at the golf course is terrific, because the rough is playable.  The greens are fast and rolling true, but the pin placements are not tricked up and trying to do some of the majors have done.  We can go out and make birdies and put out a fun display of golf.
