 Q.  First round, what were your impressions? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it's fun to get started.  I thought the golf course was playing pretty tough because of the temperature being cold and the wind was up, but I'll take under par to get it started.  I probably didn't play as well as I would have liked, but I was able to get up-and-down and salvage some pars. 

 Q.  Was the bronchitis a factor at all? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't think so, no.  I felt a lot better.  I've felt better than I have in a long time, so the last two days have been good. 

 Q.  You're going to be trailing by about two shots heading into the second round.  Are you aware that Tiger is at 6-under? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, there weren't any leaderboards on the North Course that I saw, so I haven't seen any scores yet. 

 Q.  Do you play more aggressive now that you're trailing by four shots potentially? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Not really, no. 

 Q.  How were the conditions out there today and how did they affect your game? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought it was tough to score just because it was cold and a little windy and the pins were tough to get close to because the greens were spongy.  But there were a lot of low scores.  A lot of guys shot under par, so it's not like it was unplayable by any means. 

 Q.  How strong was the wind today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably a club, club and a half. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, the North had some new tee boxes out, so it's not the North that we remember years ago.  It's got a lot of difficult holes on it right now. 

 Q.  Would you say it's as difficult as the South? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, the South is going to be the toughest, sure. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't think so, no.  Like I said, I've been feeling better the last couple days.  It should be all right.
