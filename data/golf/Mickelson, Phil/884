 Q.  Phil, you've played here a lot of years.  How was 16 today compared to years past? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it's fun.  16 is great when you hit a good shot, and I hit a terrible shot.  So they were just as hard on me as they would be anybody else, and rightfully so.  It's a hole that -- gosh, it's a lot of fun when you hit good shots. 

 Q.  You got that out of your system in a hurry, though, for the next one? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I followed it up with a birdie on the next hole, which was important.  But I've got to eliminate a couple of those mistakes.  I made two bogeys on the par 3s on the back nine today, and that pulled me back a couple of shots.  But fortunately, I'm still in position where a good round tomorrow might do it. 

 Q.  How was it going up-and-down 13 to 17?  I think it was birdie, par, birdie, bogey, birdie.  Did it feel like down one, up, down, just an odd stretch? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a little inconsistent, but I'm glad that there were more birdies than bogeys.  But I do need to eliminate those bogeys. 

 Q.  Could you tell the crowd was bigger than it's ever been today?  Did you actually get a sense of that? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think it was evident that the crowd was the largest today that it's ever been because every hole had countless people on it, and in the past it was just two or three.  I felt like the entire golf course had people everywhere.  It's so special for this tournament and for the game of golf to have something like this. 

 Q.  It's a very crowded leaderboard heading into tomorrow. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, it'll be a shootout.  I think the leaders obviously have an advantage because they have a couple of shots on the field.  But I think if the guys at 10-under, and there's a lot of them, can get off to a good start and make some birdies, it's always harder when you have to birdie to keep pace.  And I think that's the goal, is to put pressure on the leaders by making some birdies early. 

 Q.  Talk about the second shot on 16. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Just came up a little short.  Just didn't hit it solid.  Fortunately, it stayed up.  It could have come back down. 

 Q.  Feeling good going into Sunday on a course that you know this well? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Pretty good.  I feel pretty good.  I mean, I've played well at stretches, but I've also hit some horrendous shots, too.  I'm a little uncertain.  I feel like I know I can go out and shoot 3-, 4-under, but to win, I'm going to have to shoot closer to 7 or 8, and that's going to be a challenge.
