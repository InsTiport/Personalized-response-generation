   PHIL MICKELSON: You know, it was a tough day for everybody. I thought Ben Curtis played a great round of golf. It was fun to watch and fun to pull for. I was fighting hard, and in the middle of the round it kind of got me. On 10, 11, 12, I was 2-over at the turn, and I felt like if I could keep it around there I'd be okay, but those three bogeys hurt.  
 Ben's round was incredible. He hit a lot of great shots, a lot of great putts. Shot even par in this weather. It's one of the better rounds I've seen.  
  
  Q. Can you be creative out there?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think creativity is going to help you. I just kind of think you need to keep it in play and get it by the hole and try to make as many pars as you can. You need a few good breaks, and certainly Ben got one on 3 when it went in the hole. I mean, you don't expect that. It's more than just -- you have to play well, but you also need a break here or there.   
  
  Q. Is this worse than day one?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I didn't think so. I thought that Thursday morning was a lot more challenging, but this is still very tough.   
  
  Q. You spoke the other day about David Duval and his comeback. Ben has had a difficult time himself since he won the Open. Can you talk about that?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know if that's true. He's won a few times. He came back and had a two-win season just a year or two ago, maybe '06, so he's played some pretty good golf since then.  
  
  Q. They moved three tees and they only shaved the greens once. Is that enough?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: That's not for me to say whether it's right or wrong. I've always like to make the hard holes harder and the easier holes easier because I think that gives better players a chance to separate themselves and it gives the fans more birdies and bogeys. I thought that those were the three hardest holes that were made a lot easier. That kind of goes against the philosophy that I would prefer. But there's no real right or wrong answer.
