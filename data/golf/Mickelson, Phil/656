 Q. Talk a little bit about your round. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was kind of an up-and-down day. Got off to a good start. Finished at 1-over. Thought I played okay.

 Q. You didn't play here yesterday. Did you get a practice day in somewhere yesterday?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I went over to Butler, and that's in great shape. The greens there were just pristine, and I had a nice, relaxing day and was able to get my game sharp.

 Q. What's your take on this golf course?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's interesting.

 Q. Is it harder for you to play well on a course that you don't have a lot of affection for? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes. 

 Q. Is it any different from what you remember the last year? Is it any worse? Are the greens --
 PHIL MICKELSON: Everybody has got to play it. I didn't play it as effectively as I would have liked, but I got off to a good start and had some opportunities for birdies. I think finishing with a bogey there on the par-5 9th kind of left a bad taste in my mouth just because I played pretty well all day and didn't like shooting over par.

 Q. On 15 it looked like you hit two good shots to the middle of the green and then hit a flop on the green?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, that was the only chance I had I thought to keep it within eight or ten feet, and if I used the slope, it would have just gone racing by 20 feet. I could have played away from the pin to the left and maybe left about an eight- or ten-footer. That was kind of my best option. But I chose to try to get it a little closer.
