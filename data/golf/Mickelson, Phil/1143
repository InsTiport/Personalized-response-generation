Q.  Talk about your birdie on 18.
PHIL MICKELSON:   That was a big birdie for me because I struggled throughout the course of the round and birdieing the last got me within two shots of the lead, which is much better than trying to come from three or four back.  That got me back in the tournament somewhat.

I felt it was a lot more difficult playing the front nine when I saw everybody go 4  or 5 under par out ahead of me and I felt like I was losing a little bit.  I'm hoping to do the same thing tomorrow that they did to me.
Q.  With no wind, is that why everybody was going so low?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Exactly.  The wind is the real defense here at the Blue Monster.  When it doesn't blow, there's a lot of birdies, like we saw today.
Q.  Do you think 18 will be a factor tomorrow, with so many people near the lead?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's such a grouping that 18 will be a big factor.  The winner will have to make par on the last hole.

I need to get off to a good start.  I need to play a g front nine, get 3 , 4 , 5 under par and put a little pressure on the leaders and force them to make birdies just to keep up, rather than to go ahead, and it's a lot more difficult to do that.
