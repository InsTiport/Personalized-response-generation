  Q. Another great putting round for you. What do you feel is working so far for you this week?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: The ball has just been going in, and the greens are tracking beautifully. The ones that I missed today, my speed was off a little bit, but I've had pretty good speed, and it's given those putts a good chance to go in.  
  
  Q. On Sunday that's where you want to be, isn't it?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's fun to be in the last group. I'm looking forward to it. I know it's going to be difficult. I'm spotting Sergio three shots.   
 I know how well he's been playing, so it'll be a difficult round for me to get it done. But I'm in a good position at least after the first three days.  
  
  Q. How important would it be for you to cap off the year with a win?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think if I were to be able to come out on top tomorrow it would change the way I look at the year. I think a lot of good things would come of it if I were able to get it done, so it's an important round tomorrow.  
  
  Q. When you won here you were in the second to last group with Tiger.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I know I was the second to last group. I don't know how many back I was of the lead. But it should be a good round. You know, this is my final round of the year here in the U.S., and I'm going to try to put everything I can into it.   
  
  Q. Are you going to go to the Georgia game tonight?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I am going to go to the game. I think it'll be interesting, two of the best teams in college football going at it.  
  
  Q. And you're wearing black already.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I just wear black for other reasons (laughter).
