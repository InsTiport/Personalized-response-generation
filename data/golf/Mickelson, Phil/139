Q. You played the first three par-5s in 4-under par.
PHIL MICKELSON: It was a good day.  I played well and made a lot of birdies and it was a fun day.  It's also a course though that it is going to, you're going to make a lot of bogeys and doubles, unfortunately I did that today, too, but the way the changes have come out, it is -- first of all, I really like it, but second, it's faster and firmer and the misses are magnified and it's very difficult to get up-and-down around the greens.  So we're going to see a lot more bogeys and doubles and I certainly did a lot of that.
Q. Did you have to take different lines today off tees?
PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like each hole provides multiple opportunities of how to play the hole and multiple clubs off the tees.  So I thought that, I think a lot of it is just how you feel at the time, what kind of shot you feel like, how the wind is, and there's probably two or three clubs you could hit off of every single hole.  Strategically, you just have to go with what feels more comfortable.
Q. Take me through the 16th hole.
PHIL MICKELSON: I hit kind of what I call like an Augusta 13 drive, kind of a rounded slice.  It doesn't go very far, but it fits right into that fairway.  If I hit it 15 yards longer, the right side rolls off into the rough.  So I'm hitting to a little bit fatter fairway.  I've got 204 front, 205 hole and it was 211 to get past all the carry on the right.  And I hit a little cut 5-iron, it was too much club by the numbers, because it was down wind, but I opened the face and hit a little cut off of a tight lie and it comes kind of a little bit lower when you catch it lower on the face, it spins more.  It carried right in the center of the green.  Checked up, I had six or seven feet and made a good putt.
