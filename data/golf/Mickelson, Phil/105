Q. (No Microphone.)
PHIL MICKELSON: It was a nice way to finish after not getting off to a great start.  It can be a difficult golf course, but it's also a course you play well, you'll make some birdies.  Unfortunately, I saw both ends of it today.  But the back nine I was able to get back in it.
Q. Did you find something or just golf?
PHIL MICKELSON: I just kind of settled in.  I don't really know what the difference was.  I played the two par-5s in 2-over the front nine and if I played them 2-under it's a whole different round.
Q. Sometimes I walk around this golf course and it's still a wonder that you shot 62 here.
PHIL MICKELSON: I do too.
(Laughter.)
Q. You've been coming here for 20 plus years, long days out there and sometimes guys don't like it, what keeps bringing you back?
PHIL MICKELSON: I really enjoy this event and it's a great opportunity to use the strength of the game of golf, which is the ability to play and compete with fans of the game and to be able to interact with many of the people that support and sponsor the game of golf.  This is a big tournament for us, so having that personal relationship really adds to the PGA TOUR and its partnerships.  But more than that, I love the golf courses and I love coming up here and playing on days like this that make it just spectacular.  Even the bad weather days you come to enjoy and appreciate the challenge of this place, but I just love everything about it.
Q. What did you think of Rory's play out there?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he played good, solid golf.  He shot a nice opening round and he's fun to be around.  I really enjoy he and his dad and we had a good time.
Q. What was that like between the two of them?
PHIL MICKELSON: Very respectful.  I mean they have got a great relationship.  It's very respectful and fun to be around.
Q. Do you see something different in Rory this year compared to the last couple years, just in terms of intensity, fire?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's first day with him this year so it's hard to tell, but his game sure looks sharp.
