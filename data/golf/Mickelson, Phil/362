Q.   Phil, you made it really interesting on 11 and came back with a couple of birdies here to really make a really good round.   How do you feel about it?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Scott, the first 29 holes of that tournament I've putted terrible.   It just clicked on 12 and every putt from there on in started on line and it feels good.   I made one on 12, made one on 13, and the ones coming in there after I had right on line.   Made a good 4-footer on the last hole.   It feels much better.   Small little adjustment in the set-up and all of a sudden it's starting to click. 
I'm excited about the weekend because first of all I haven't had many opportunities this year.   I haven't been here in contention and I can feel my game start to get sharp.

Q.   You went 63, 65 here when you won.   Obviously you're in a decent position here again.   Does that give you some enthusiasm about the weekend?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It does.   When you get hot, you can make a lot of birdies here.   When you're playing well, every hole seems like it's a potential birdie hole.   I don't know what scores are going to be necessary to win and come out on top this weekend because we just don't know what the conditions are going to be like. 
It was a lot more difficult today with this wind than it was the first day.   And the scores you saw quite a bit higher.   But either way I feel like I felt better than I have in a long time with my game, and when the putter started turning there the last seven holes, I'm excited about the weekend. 

Q.   How is your health?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Feels good.   It's weird how -- I guess I'm just getting older, but all these little aches and pains, but I feel -- I'm surprised.   I was really worried last Saturday.   I was really worried about not only playing here but next week, and now it feels great.
