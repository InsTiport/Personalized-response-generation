  Q. You have Kyung-tae Kim and Y.E. Yang this afternoon in the four-ball competition; you need to make some putts and you need to make some birdies in that. What are your thoughts about turning it around with the putter?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: We have to keep doing what we are doing. We are hitting the ball well and we are seeing the lines good, too. Just have to get it going in the hole. Like you said, it's three different speeds so it's tough. No different need to go work on the speed.   
 It's tough to get these speeds down when you play three days and three different speeds. But we are both playing really well so we are looking forward to this afternoon.   
  
  Q. 3-0 this week, did not look like that was going to be the outcome, but you got it going.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: We turned it around. We got off to a poor start on the greens and we just turned it around. We fought hard and stayed in the match and we ended up having a nice run on the back nine. We were 2-down and we ended up winning 3 & 1.   
  
  Q. I noticed you had a little talk with your partner after the second shot at 9, kind of get him going again; was there anything specifically that you can share about that conversation?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I felt like just because they hit a really great shot, we might have tried to press to make three there, and that pin, it was almost impossible to get to. I thought we just need to play our game. We didn't need to try and play and do something exceptional based on their great play.   
 We know how good Jason Day and Aaron Baddeley are, they are great players. They are going to hit great shots like that but we can't take it out of our element. There's holes like 11 we are going to make birdie, and a couple other opportunities, which we did. I just didn't want to force things when we didn't need to.  
  
  Q. You will have a new partner this afternoon in Nick Watney in the anchor match. Any regrets? Any thoughts?   
 JIM FURYK: I enjoyed my time with Phil. We had a good time. He's going to sit this afternoon and I have to get my legs ready and let the young guy carry me. I'm anxious to watch Nick drive the ball. He hits it long and straight, and try to feed off some of that.   
  
  Q. This is the first time you are going to sit in some of these matches; are you surprised and what did Fred Couples just share with you about that decision?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, we talked about it. I wanted to take the afternoon off if it was possible. I thought and Fred thought that everybody was playing well and we had some good pairings they wanted to send out.   
 This gives me a chance to get ready for my singles match and also follow some of the matches and maybe just show some support. I really enjoy that part of The Ryder Cup where we have four guys sitting. We don't have the opportunity much in The Presidents Cup, because only two guys sit.   
 I like being out there, supporting the guys. I just think it's fun and this has been a really fun week.   
  
  Q. Any chance you might practice a little ping-pong and get ready for that match this afternoon, too?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I wouldn't rule that out. Matty Kuch has my number. I can't sneak by him. He's been so fun to have on the team though. He has my number on the pong table as well as off. He gives me more a bigger hard time than anybody and he's so funny, he does is it such a funny light; I enjoy being around him.
