  Q. Great comeback out there on the golf course today. Looked like it started on No. 7.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, thanks. I ended up getting off to a poor start, a couple over through six holes. I did get a birdie on 7 and was able to match one on 10 and 11, but really, the eagle on 14 and the birdie on 15 was the round. That was where I was able to make up some ground and give myself at least a reasonable chance where if I can go low tomorrow I might have a chance to catch the guys in front of me.  
  
  Q. I've got to ask you about that eagle on 14. Did you really mean to start it that far left over the water?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: You know, maybe not quite that far (laughing), but I was trying to draw it because I wanted it drawing with the wind to miss it to the right, and then I was going to just chip back. I thought the back right bunker was a good spot to be. I started it a little further left. It still drew and landed on.   
  
  Q. Good putt.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, that was a big one. It was going a little fast, too. It might have gone six, eight feet by. It was a good thing it hit the hole.  
  
  Q. Tell me about the playing going into tomorrow, because it looks like with the way the wind is blowing, no one is going to run away with this thing.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm hoping to be within striking distance. I hope I'll be in a spot where a low round tomorrow will be able to make up some ground, but there's so many guys ahead of me that it will be difficult to catch the leaders without going low. They're not all going to come back, so I'll have to go out and play a low round, but at least I have a chance.   
 When I was back at even par for the tournament, not looking very good. At least I put myself to where I have a chance for a low round.
