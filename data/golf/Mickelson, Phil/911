 Q.  Phil, two very solid rounds for you, 2-under, 4-under.  If you use that mathematical progression through the weekend, you're in for a heck of a Saturday and Sunday. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'm going to need to play some good golf here on this weekend.  I've felt like I've been playing fairly solid but I have not gotten the ball as close to the hole or made as many putts as I would like.  On this course there's a lot of birdies out there, so I have got to get aggressive tomorrow.  Hopefully some putts will fall and I'll be able to make a run where I have a chance on Sunday. 

 Q.  You've played well here so many times.  In some ways does that work against you because your memory is engrained of the course the way it has been playing in the past and it's a little bit softer this year? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I don't think so.  I think it's fun for us to play a course where we can be aggressive like this.  So many times this year we've just been beaten up with penalizing, brutal rough and fast, hard greens and ridiculous wins that it's fun for us to have a chance to make birdies. 

 Q.  You may have a couple 63s in the bag this weekend. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm going to need them.  Thank you.
