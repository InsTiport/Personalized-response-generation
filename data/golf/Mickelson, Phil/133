 Q.  How did it go today?  
PHIL MICKELSON: You know, I hit it really well, but this has been probably the two worst putting days I've had this year.  (Indiscernible) relative to how I've been playing.   
But there's no excuse.  The greens are perfect.  I just haven't been able to putt well.   
 Q.  Couple birdies there on the back and front coming in and then two late stumbles.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I hit it close and made a couple birdies, and then on 7 I had a good chance for birdie and ended up 3-putting it, which is terrible.  Put it in a bad spot on 8 and made bogey there.   
But, looks like it's the first time I'm going to make the cut here, so baby steps.   
 Q.  Speaking of that, with Sebastian is so far out there you can't even look...  
PHIL MICKELSON: No, not yet.  Like I say, I struggled here in the past.  Haven't made the cut.  This year looks like I'm at least going to make the cut.   
I'll come out tomorrow early -- and I hit the ball really well today -- and see if I can get this putter fixed.  Putting has been really a strength for me last couple years, but today and yesterday we've really struggled.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: Little bit of everything.  The greens are perfect.  There is no excuse to not make putts.   
I just haven't started them on the right line and had the right speed.  Just haven't putted them well.   
 Q.  Second day with your brother as caddie.  
PHIL MICKELSON: He's been doing a great job.  We're having fun.  Like I say, I'm looking forward to the weekend.  We're having a good time together, so it's been good.   
 Q.  How important was it to you to make the cut?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's a big thing for me.  I mean, I have made every cut this year so far so I had a good feeling going in that I was going to do it.  I cut it a little close with those late bogeys.
