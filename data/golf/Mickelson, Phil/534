 Q.   When you look back on where you are right now, is it about the charge today or surviving on Thursday?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it's Thursday, because at some point on this golf course I'm going to get hot and make some birdies and maybe an eagle here or there, but I've got to be in a position where it moves me up the leaderboard and not just gets me to the weekend.   And the way I fought back on Thursday, keeping me in it, allowed me to make a run to shoot up the leaderboard.  
   
 Q.   You had some great moments out there, the eagle putt at 13.   Tell me about that.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I've hit that putt so many times over the years and just knew that that ball was going to curl in sideways, and I knew it was slow up that hill, and the ball just crept over the lip.   It was a great feeling to see that one go.   That was a big momentum change right there.  
   
 Q.   Your putting has been outstanding all year long.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's been so good, it's been the best I've had in my career probably, putting.   I really worked hard in the off‑season and made a real commitment to what I was doing.   All year it's been great, but this week on these greens where I know the breaks and they roll so true, it's been really good.  
   
 Q.   Just quickly tell me about the wedge shot at 15.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   There was some risk in that one.   I do not like missing long on that hole with that pin.   It's just such a hard shot, and I got lucky because the pin placement was slightly forward than where it sometimes is.   It sometimes is a yard or two further back, and I had a great lie, and that's where‑‑ that shot right there is where that 64‑degree wedge has really helped me around this golf course, being able to slide it underneath on tight lies like that.   The ball popped up nice and soft.
