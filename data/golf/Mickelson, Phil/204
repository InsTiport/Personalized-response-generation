Q. Tough conditions, obviously, out there today, how disappointed are you in that round?
PHIL MICKELSON: I thought it was very fair test. I thought there was opportunities out there. I thought that the greens were receptive, the pins were fine. I don't know how to explain it, I just threw away a lot of shots, I just made a lot of poor shots in the wrong spot. This is worst I've managed myself around this golf course. I don't know what to say. It's disappointing. I love this tournament so much, and I've been playing so well, to come in and make some of those mistakes and the doubles and stuff that I made today is very disappointing. So, that's about it. 

Q. Phil is it mental out there more than mechanical would you say?
PHIL MICKELSON: I had a couple of little, just a couple of little things. I mean, on 7 is where it started. I had 119, I'm trying get to the pin and I hit a good shot and then the wind stopped and I came up short and instead of just making sure I get out, I left it in the bunker. I mean, just stupid things. 
Missed a 3‑footer on 8 and ended up 3‑putting from there. 
Water on 15, water on 16. 
Just a lot of mistakes. This was the worst I've managed myself around this golf course. It's a very ‑‑ it was very playable today, with difficult conditions, and there was some opportunities to make birdies, and I just made a lot of mistakes. I hit it in the wrong spots a lot. 

Q. It's one thing to watch it on TV and see the wind and see how you guys deal with it, but how is it really out there with the wind today?
PHIL MICKELSON: I know it was tough, but it wasn't as tough as I made it look. It was very playable. I mean, if you hit good shots, I thought you could score. I thought it was very fair. I just, I hit the shot in the wrong spot. 

Q. No excuses press conference right here, right?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, if it weren't the case, I would say it. But I thought the greens were receptive and I didn't think the pins were bad, by any means. They were very ‑‑ I thought they were susceptible to some birdies. 
If you look at the pin on 3 back there, there's plenty of room to get to it. 
5 was a good uphill putt ‑‑ I just thought it was set up very, very well. The guys that played well got rewarded and the guys who did dumb stuff like I did shot a big number. So it happens.

Q. When you see what, how Jordan came back, does it make anymore frustrating? I mean, basically, you were right there for a time. 
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, when I look back on my round and see, you know, I could pull 10 shots that were just, I should be right in the tournament. And I'm not because you just can't play golf at this level making those mistakes. But, again, I'll learn from it and I love the ‑‑ I just love this tournament. I love the opportunity that I had today. I feel like I was really given a good opportunity to get myself right in the tournament. With the weather, with the way the course was set up, and the way I was playing. 
Because I had a great practice session starting out. Got off to a good start. Made some birdies early and I really thought this was going to be a good day. And, unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. 

Q. The last time you missed the cut you stood here and told us how you would go home and watch it on weekend because you love this tournament so much. Are you going to do the same?
PHIL MICKELSON: Probably. I mean, I'm not sure what my plans are right now, but probably. I love everything about the event and I just wish I was a part of it.
