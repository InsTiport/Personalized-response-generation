Q.   You were hitting the ball nicely. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I putted very poorly.   The greens were fine though.   They're never easy, but they're as good as I've seen them and I'm just not putting very well. 

Q.   Seems you've gone from conventional to claw in the middle of a round.   What are you trying to gain out of it?   Just find something?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It depends.   It's been three or four different things over the years. 

Q.   I saw you stretching your back on 18, was that because of the cold or is it bothering you?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'll try to stretch all body parts, calves, shoulders, elbow, when it gets cold.   It's not anything to do with just the back.   I hope you guys do too, when it gets cold.

Q.   Even if you were frustrated with the putting, in these conditions to be close to par, are you satisfied to any extent with the score today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Tee to green I'm playing very well, but I haven't putted this poorly in a year.   I've been putting very well for quite some time and it's just been off.   And for the way I'm hitting it, it's a little disappointing, because I should have a really good opportunity.   And I'll have to turn it around.   It's in the too late, but I got to get it turned around here. 

Q.   Given the forecast tomorrow, is it kind of nice to be done with Pebble with the wind and rain keeping up?
PHIL MICKELSON:   What's the forecast tomorrow? 

Q.   Bad?
PHIL MICKELSON:   More of this?   Cool.   I mean ‑‑
(Laughter.)   We have had great run of weather probably the last six, seven years.   We have had some terrific weather.   So we certainly can't complain. 
In fact, it's sometimes a fun challenge to play out here and as the reigning Scottish and British Open champion, I don't really mind the elements, but I do have to get this putter worked out.

Q.   Was it a fun challenge today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I thought it was, yeah.   It was challenging.

Q.   How hard was it to read that putt on 18, the speed of it?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, it was just, I couldn't get myself to stay stable.   I mean the putter was moving back and forth at address.   I had a hard time just getting it stable.   And that's part of the challenge.   That's part of the challenge in putting in wind.   But that was, I've got to get this thing worked out.

Q.   Peyton had a tough day at work last Sunday and he turned to golf.   And if you have a tough day, I know you like football and you throw it around, will you turn to football?
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, I'm going to go work on my putter.   I think that if I can get this putter worked out, I think there's enough time to make a move. 

Q.   Can you appreciate though what he's going through and wanting to go do something relaxing?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I love that he's out here.   He's a huge asset to this tournament.   He really brings a lot to this event.   And it's what this tournament is about. 
It's what it's ‑‑ he helps bring the game of golf to other people that wouldn't be exposed to the game.   And that's, we're lucky to have him here.

Q.   You said you're going to work on your putting, but usually you would be outside working, are you going to go somewhere or go somewhere else and go inside and work?
PHIL MICKELSON:   We'll see how the weather pans out here the next couple of hours.   If it clears up a little bit, I'll spend a little time on the greens.   I'm putting very poorly.   Greens are fine though.   They're never easy, but they're as good as I've seen them and I'm just not putting tremendous very well.
