 Q.  Tell us about the round today, how did it go?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought I played pretty well until I looked up and saw that Davis was 9-under.  I played well to shoot 6-under.  The wind was pretty calm this morning.  The greens were rolling perfect, as usual.  The golf course is in great shape and I hit some good shots, made some good shots and shot 6-under. 

Q.  What do you think were your strengths out there today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I kept the ball in play very well.  And driving on this golf course is critical.  When I did miss a shot or two it stayed pretty much in play where I could recover.  I was able to salvage some pars when I did miss a green or two, and made some good birdie putts. 

Q.  What was it like shooting a great round and still looking up at the board and three behind?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it's interesting to play well and see somebody go really well.  But you try not to worry about it, because there are three rounds left.  And hopefully over the next 54 holes maybe I can make some good birdies there and catch him.
