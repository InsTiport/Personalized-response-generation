Q. 3-under start.  Just get some comments on your opening round.
PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't probably play my best, I didn't really putt great and didn't drive it great.  But I shot 3-under and it's an okay start.  And to birdie the last feels good too, so it was a good way to finish.  But all in all I didn't feel like I played great but I didn't shoot myself out of it so that's a positive.
Q. The fans out here love you.  How does that help keep you in the game?
PHIL MICKELSON: It really does help.  It helps keep me up when I don't have my best stuff and I thought it was a factor today where I didn't quite have my best stuff but it kept me focused there to finish the round off and make a couple of birdies coming in, which I did.  So it was a key factor.
Q. I could hear the roar from the crowd, I was like, oh, Phil must have done something.  What's it like to finish up strong there, especially in the first round?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's nice to play an okay, solid start.  Tomorrow we'll have a chance with an early morning tee time to hopefully get a hot round going, but I didn't play as well as I wanted to, but I didn't shoot myself out of it, so I'll see if I can go low tomorrow.
Q. 30th year for you.  Does it ever get old hat or is this one always something special?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, this is a special place, this just never gets old.
