PHIL MICKELSON:  I am not ecstatic.  It wasn't a very good round.  It was a struggle. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know if the golf course played much easier than it had yesterday especially, and it was susceptible to low scores, if you played well.  I saw a couple of guys go pretty low.  It was there to be had.  
I thought the greens were very fair.  They were still pretty soft and you can fly shots and get it stopped.  So it was a very fair test and I just didn't play well. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know what to say.  Those things have happened before in the past and I don't know what else to say. 

Q.   Did it mentally beat up on you (inaudible)--
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I just didn't hit very many good shots.  I didn't feel like I played atrocious, but certainly with what happened -- I didn't feel like I played atrocious, but certainly what happened on 10 hurt score-wise  didn't really affect my play coming in. I felt like I held it together, but throwing away that many shots at one hole certainly hurt.

Q.   (Inaudible)
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know if it was that.  I don't know what to say.  It wasn't any different than other pins.  It was  -- I don't know what to tell you. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
PHIL MICKELSON:  I was actually trying to make birdies.  I felt like with eight holes left I can get 3 back and even par for the day.  I thought that would be a successful round.  I didn't birdie 11 and I hit a very poor bunker shot there and that was a hole that I needed to get.  16 I needed to get the ball in the fairway to make birdie there.  And didn't do it.  Then I just needed one more birdie here or there.  So I wasn't able to do that.  I made a bunch of pars even though I was trying to make birdie, but it just wasn't happening?

Q.   What goes through your mind (inaudible)  --
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Actually when I went over the next tee I just had to laugh about it.  It is not like I could do anything about it and it's  -- it was just a fluke deal.  I don't know what else to tell you.  I tried to laugh it off and play hard the last eight holes.

Q.   (Inaudible)
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I am quite aways back now.  I am going to try to get off to a quick start see if I can shoot 4-, 5-, 6-under par the front side to make a run at it.  The key for me is to get off to a quick start tomorrow.  That's really all I am focusing on because if I want to have any chance or really just have a good tournament or good round tomorrow I need to get off to a quick start.

Q.   (Inaudible)
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's really not. I felt like I made a lot of good putts.  I had that 3-putt on 17, but I made a good par-putt on 13.  I feel like I made a great putt on 9 just before that; made good putts on 3 for birdie and good par save on 4.  I feel like I am rolling the ball well, and I don't know what else to say. It is not as though my confidence wasn't there. I made a good putt on 18 to finish the day. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It seems to happen here every year, so no, I am really not.  It's happened here a bunch with guys who have not won tournaments, have tried to make this their first win, and I have known about Craig Perks and Carl Paulson for a while.  They are players that maybe not everybody is familiar with, but those out on Tour are and know that they are very talented and a lot of players on Tour expect them to win soon and tomorrow is probably a very good chance for them.
