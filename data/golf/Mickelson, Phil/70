Q. They made a lot of birdies.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, they played some great golf.  They were 4-under on the front nine in some very difficult conditions.  I thought if we could shoot around par, it would be a heck of a day.  We played poorly the front but they shot 4-under.  It was just some very impressive golf, and we just didn't keep up.
Q. What are you working with on your game right now, or what are you lacking?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, even if we had played really well, it would have been tough to hang with them.  They played incredibly well the front.  But we've just got to regroup and come out sharp.  There's a lot of golf left, a lot of matches and we've just got to come out and bring our best stuff.
Q. What did Jim say about playing in this format?
PHIL MICKELSON: We thought that this would be a good format for the tee shots, hitting a bunch of irons off the tees.  The challenge was -- well we just didn't play our best.  I don't know what to say.  They played phenomenal golf and I'm not trying to take it away from them.  We just weren't at our best either.
Q. You have been on the end of these Euro runs before and still had success.  What will it be like tonight in the team room?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, we've got to come out and bring our best stuff.  We know these matches are going to be close.  We know it's going to be a fight till the end, and we've got a lot of points left.  We've only played eight points so far, and we just need to bring our best stuff and we will.
