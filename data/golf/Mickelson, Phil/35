PHIL MICKELSON: It doesn't feel anywhere near as bad as it did a couple months ago.  Feel like I'm a lot closer.  This was a disappointing day for me.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, you know, it happened at Memorial, too.  I was in contention after the first round, had a good first round, and first shot hits the cart path on 10 at Memorial and goes out of bounds.  Same thing here.
I didn't really right the ship very well.  But, again, I feel like I've had a couple good breakthroughs and my ball striking game is much closer than it's been.  I'm want to keep playing now because I feel like it's closer.  Today was just not what I expected.
Q. (Regarding playing after majors and energy levels.)
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think that was the case.  I was really excited to play and came out yesterday with a lot of energy and hit a lot of good shots and was ready to get up in it.
I also had the week off before the Open so I wasn't too tired.  I don't know.  I just had a fluke nine holes.
Q. (Regarding rain.)
PHIL MICKELSON: I thought -- I mean, you could say that, but I thought the course was very gettable.  I thought it was in great shape.  It handled the rain really well.
Guys that played well and played smart, strategic golf could still shoot something in the mid-60s and have a good day.  You say Jason Day do it.
It's a little disappointing because I really felt like my game was coming around.  This is a good golf course for my game, too.  Just unfortunately didn't put it together.  Had a really rough nine there.
Q. Going to play before the British?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, in Minnesota.  Take next week off and go to Minnesota.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
PHIL MICKELSON: I think so.  I really like the course, and given the way the schedule is with it being difficult for me to play the weeks before majors, there is a good chance I'll start playing weeks after.
