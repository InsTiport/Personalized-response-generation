Q.   Enjoyable opening round? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I played well.   I thought it was tough conditions.   I was surprised to see some of those low scores out there because it didn't seem like it was playing easy and the wind was pretty strong and the fairways were tight. 
But I felt like I played well, and had a good putting day and it was a good day.

Q.   And it's dry.   You must be disappointed given you wanted wind. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, it would have been fun, but this has been fun, too.   It was a good first round.

Q.   How big a change and challenge is this from Castle Stuart?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a different style of links golf course.   Castle Stuart is more on a modern day scale as far as the distance and bunker placement and you're hitting longer shots, whereas here, it's a lot older golf course and the maneuvering around bunkers requires more iron play. 

Q.   After the start you've had today, how do you feel it sets you up for the next three days?   You must be in a pretty positive frame of mind. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a good first day.   It was tough conditions and I think you're going to see some low scores but you'll see some high scores, too, because it's playing tough. 
It was a good start. 

Q.   You haven't played since the U.S. Open, some time off, and working on your short game and putting, is there anything that pleased you, having not played for a little bit? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I putted well.   I had a really good putting day.   Outside of the last hole, I had a great 17 holes of putting, and you know, the challenge‑‑ it's very challenging in these conditions putting in crosswinds and trying to judge the break and factor in the wind, and I had a good day.   I putted really well today.
