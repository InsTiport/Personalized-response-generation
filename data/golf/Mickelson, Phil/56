PHIL MICKELSON: I'm going to go there now.  I'm going to go there tonight and spend the next three or four days there and I'm looking forward to it.  It's the greatest week of the year.  It's the best week.  Best tournament.  Excited to get there and spend time.   
 Q.  Is that sort of like the silver lining to not making it to the weekend here, get there early?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah.  I think that's why I've enjoyed this match play is if things don't go well -- I always go the Monday, Tuesday the week before, so it works out, I get an extra day or two there.   
 Q.  Is there anything you're going to specifically concentrate on?  
PHIL MICKELSON: This has been a good week to find out what I'm doing well, what I need to work on.  Andrew and I were talking about it last night.  I now have 10 days, 11 days to work on it.  That's the good thing that comes of these matches.  Plus you have the intensity of the final round every time you tee off.  It's not like it's a third day in a regular tournament, oh, well, whatever.  You've got to play well to win, so you can really find out what areas you need work.   
 Q.  Does it matter you were 1-2 instead of 0-3?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Not really, no.  Jason and I had a fun day.  We've played a lot against each other in President Cups and stuff and we enjoy competing with each other, but it doesn't matter either way.   
 Q.  What does happen to you when you go down Magnolia Lane for the first time every year?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It's just an exciting feeling.  We all love the game of golf and what it's done for us.  So going down that special place, you just are appreciative of that opportunity, because very few people get to do it.   
 Q.  Have you fallen off from the Pebble Beach level?  Is there something you need to get back?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It's a different style of golf.  You can't hit high drives there like at AT&T.  And come here you're trying to hit these low scooters, to keep it out of the wind.  So it's a different style of play.  And I tried to put another driver in and driving iron in to kind of manage my way around here, but none of it was really -- it's very different than the way AT&T plays.  As a player, you have to be able to adjust to that, but I haven't done that yet.   
 Q.  Is that something to be concerned about?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I'm not.  I certainly would have liked to have some better finishes and go in there with some momentum, but the fact is I've been playing well for the most part this year.  I had some good things this week come about and started to putt well again.  I haven't putted to the level that I've been the last few years, and so that's starting to turn.  And my speed is up.  I'll go have a good workweek, really maximize my speed and see if I can hit it long and far at Augusta and hopefully straight.   
 Q.  Do you remember a team that was quite this strong heading into the Presidents Cup?  
PHIL MICKELSON: What team?   
 Q.  United States.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was last year at the Ryder Cup.  It didn't work out that well for us, so it's hard to say.   
 Q.  Do you ever remember a time where there was this many people in their 20s, 30s and 40s all battling like this?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, there's a lot of good players playing well.  So it will be interesting to see how it plays out.   
 Q.  What do you think it would be like playing for Tiger potentially?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think it would be awesome.  I would love it.
