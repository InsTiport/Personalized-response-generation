   PHIL MICKELSON:  We were both 6-, 8-under par, so it was a good match, but unfortunately I just didn't shoot low enough. 

 Q.  What would you consider the difference in the match? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, we were even, and he birdied three of the last four holes that we played.  And I thought 17 I needed to make a 4 to extend the match.  I felt like I hit the shot where I wanted to, just it ended up not where I wanted it and I had a tough time making 4.  I wanted a chance on 18, but unfortunately I didn't get it.
