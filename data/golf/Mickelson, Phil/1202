Q.   Talk about how things went. Talk about the conditions.

PHIL MICKELSON: The conditions were difficult, but I was playing well today, but I scored 5 or 6 shots than the way I played and that was the challenge. I played very well the front and had a chance to go really low to shoot 4-, 5-, 6-under par and missed every one of my putts.  But were reasonable length.  I think I missed four putts inside eight feet, that hurt, but tomorrow it is going to be difficult being six back of Shigeki, especially as well as he had been playing.  The wind was very difficult and downwind because the greens were receptive was the choice of winds.  When the greens are hard you almost would rather be into the wind.  The last three holes played straight into the wind, so it is a tough finish.  16  is no longer the easy birdie hole where it is a reachable par 5.  It was a three-shotter and  a tough pin position and 17 is always a tough pin position and 18 is just a tough hole into the wind.  So it is a tough finish into the wind and you need to make your birdies earlier in the round.  You need to make them more on the front side where you have the par 5 that is straight downwind like 7.  Then you have  some shorter holes that are playing more downwind.  Backside is playing a lot harder with 14, 15 being also into the wind, so you have got five holes coming down the stretch that are very difficult you try to just hold on or salvage your round there because it can easily slide away; as it did with mine making a double and a bogey.  It's a tough finish.  You need to get off to a good start, and make your birdies in the first half of the round.
