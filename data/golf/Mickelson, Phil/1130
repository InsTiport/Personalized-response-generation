Q.
I'm actually looking forward to Colonial and you're scheduled to play there.  Once you get past this, you've got to be excited about the different types of shots that that golf course offers you.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's a wonderful course, it's a wonderful tournament and hopefully I'll play well.  We'll see how it goes.
Q.  What's your schedule for the rest of the year after the Open?  Are you going to play a lot?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'm going to play the week before the Open and then I'm debating on maybe taking a couple weeks off.

I could tell I wasn't as mentally fresh and ready to play this week as I have been, so maybe I'll take the next few weeks off getting ready to play the Open.  We'll see how I feel.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it just wasn't a very good round today.  I don't know what to say.  It was not playing easy starting out, but it wasn't playing overly difficult, either.  You could have shot a pretty good round if you played well, and I just didn't.

I think that I wasn't entering these last two rounds with the same focus or mental freshness and I've had this year and I think maybe I'm a little tired.  I might take a couple of weeks off.  We'll see how it goes.
Q.  Is that the one negative to winning The Masters, winning your first major?  Does it take up much of your time?
PHIL MICKELSON:  There's not too many negatives that I can think of from winning The Masters.  It's been a lot of fun and I've had a great time with it and I've really enjoyed playing golf this year.  It's been fun.
Q.  Does being this far back from the lead, does this course allow you to come back and regain some of those shots over the weekend?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, no, since I didn't make the weekend, that won't be possible.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  The wind early on was very difficult.  The back nine it wasn't that bad.  You could really shoot some good low scores the back nine.  The front nine I was 3-over pretty quick and had a hard time getting things turned around.  You have those rounds.  I don't know what else to say.  It wasn't fun today, but I've had a lot of fun this year, so I'm not going to complain.
