 Q.  Can you talk about today's round? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I shot 1-over.  It wasn't a very good round.  I made a number of bogeys and made some good birdies, but just didn't get it under par.  There were a lot of low rounds out there.  Even though the weather wasn't the best, there were still a lot of birdies to be made.  I just made too many mistakes.  Hopefully I'll come back tomorrow with a good round. 

 Q.  How is the course playing? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think the course is very fair.  It's playing longer because it's colder and the ball is not traveling as far, but the greens are receptive and you can get to some pins, so there's a lot of birdies out there. 

 Q.  Have you had a crazy round like that lately? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Up-and-down?  Yeah, I just made too many mistakes, a couple 3-putts, just a couple of poor bogeys that negated all the good holes I had, so tomorrow I need to eliminate those and keep firing at the pins. 

 Q.  What's your driver situation this week?  Somebody told us last week you used three different drivers. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Last week I was experimenting a little with the one I was going to use at Augusta, and I think I found that.  It's going to be one of the FTIs, that square-headed driver. 
 And this week is the FT-5 that I've been playing in the off-season and have anticipated playing this year.  I'll use this club a lot. 

 Q.  After a day like today, what do you do to prepare for tomorrow? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I'll have -- I'll take the afternoon off, and then tomorrow morning I'll go up to Whisper Rock and get a three-, four-hour practice session in before I play and see if I can get my irons straightened out and the putter.  Even though I made some decent putts, I didn't feel comfortable on the greens. 

 Q.  Was that the biggest problem today was the driver? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I missed three fairways.  I drove it great.  The two fairways that I missed I made bogeys.  I had some tough spots.  I thought I drove it very well today.  I didn't feel good on the greens and just didn't get the ball close enough. 

 Q.  How does the crowd help you here? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I love playing here.  The people here are just the best.  It's like no other event.  We don't ever get this many people at any golf tournament, so I think the players really enjoy coming here. 

 Q.  It's not the fastest start.  What do you need to get going to crank your game up? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, a good low round in the 60s would be nice.  I remember in '05 I started out 2-over the first day and came back with a 60 the second day.  Now, I might be pushing it to try to shoot that again, but I think I can get 5-, 6-, 7-under par and get back in it for the weekend. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Kind of up-and-down like it was today?  What do you mean?  Oh, no, I took three, four months after.  I knew my game would be a little rusty, and it has been.  I just haven't been able to put it all together.  It's getting closer, though.  I feel like it's coming around a little bit.  But I need to have it speed up. 

 Q.  How is your confidence level then, okay? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's okay.  I just need to get a little more comfortable on the greens and hit the ball a little closer and I'll start feeling better. 

 Q.  Are you using the one putter or are you switching around using different putters, too? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No, I have the same two putters.  I've used the same two putters for five or six years, and I just kind of go back and forth.
