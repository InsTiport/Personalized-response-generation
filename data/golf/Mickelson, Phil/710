  Q. Phil, this is going to be a frustrating game. It was certainly frustrating today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it was.  
  
  Q. Did you notice any improvement out there? Because I thought your stroke looked good at times and really was one bad swing that started off a chain of events at the 10th.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: That's true, but what was frustrating was not making the 12-footer there or not making the 20-footer the next hole, not making the 10-footer the next hole or 3-putting from 12 feet on the following hole. That kind of wore on me.   
  
  Q. You found enough to find the fairway at the 18th and hit a quality shot in and walk away with your par and qualify for weekend play.  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah. That's not much consolation, though. I had a chance there with a solid back-9. I hadn't made any bogies the front-9. A solid back-9 I'm going to be within one or two of the lead. To be back on the cut line is a frustrating feeling.  
  
  Q. When was the last time you hit a right-handed shot?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Probably the last tournament. I seem to be doing that a lot lately.
