 Q.  Do you feel like you worked today? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I had to work today, yes.  I didn't put myself in the best places off the tee.  I'm going to see if I can get that worked out and straightened out for the weekend.  If you hit some good tee shots and hit some fairways, you can make some birdies. 

 Q.  You were saying the other day that you really think a straight hitter has the best advantage out here, but it looked like you were managing a lot of bad lies in the rough. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I got up-and-down a lot to kind of salvage the round, but certainly you can't play all four days like that.  You might be able to hang in there and keep it around par, which is what I did today, so that if you do turn and if you do start to hit the ball well, you can make some birdies and move up the leaderboard. 

 Q.  The way Vijay, Tiger, Harrington, some of those guys are playing right now, all 6-under par, do you feel like you have to go low for tomorrow or Sunday? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I think that lead will be lower than 6-under because the greens are starting to soften up with the rain, and I think guys will be able to shoot under par in the afternoon.  So I anticipate being five or six shots back and then I'll have to go out tomorrow and shoot a good round to get in it for Sunday. 

 Q.  Talk about the conditions and how it's changed now over this week, how it's slowly cooling off and now we have rain.  Is it harder, is it easier? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Wind is what makes a golf course hardest, and firm greens, and so with the rain coming and the lack of wind, I think the course is playing a lot easier and we'll be able to have a few low rounds out there. 

 Q.  What was the deciding factor to go with the putter on the back edge of the 18th green? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought that if I tried to lob it over the hills, I may go off the front of the green and down the fairway 10, 12 yards, and then I'd be looking at six.  So I just accepted five. 
 You know, that's the third or fourth time that's happened, where I hit a pretty good shot and I've got to play 15, 20 feet away from the hole, so you just have to be in the right spots on these greens because they're very difficult. 

 Q.  Everybody is coming in saying the same thing, about just understanding these greens right now is maybe the hardest thing. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, it is.  Yeah, that's a nice way of putting it.  Thanks.
