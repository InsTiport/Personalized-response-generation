PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm sorry for all the fans that come out and support us like the way they have. I mean, this has been kind of a crazy scenario. Although I'm not necessarily worried for my own health, I don't want to get it and infect anybody else. I don't want to infect anybody that wouldn't be able to fight it off. I'm trying all I can to not touch people, to clean my hands with Purell or soap and water, whatever, so that I don't get it to get anybody else sick. I'm not worried about myself per se, but I don't want to infect anybody.   
 Q.  What was the vibe like out there today?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Different. There's not as many people as normal. I've never played a TOUR event like we were going to play tomorrow with no fans. It will be a very weird experience, and I feel bad for the people here that have supported this tournament for so many decades to not be able to come on out. But this is a pretty serious thing that we need to do all we can to make sure that people don't lose lives over it that we can prevent.   
 Q.  Are you surprised that the TOUR is going to play even without fans because of the travel that's involved?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm not surprised necessarily because it's not an enclosed environment, so it's a little bit different than say an arena. But I don't know. I'm not really that knowledgeable enough on the whole thing. I just am taking it very seriously because of the reports that I've read.   
 Q.  Could you envision Augusta without fans?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know. I don't know that far. Hopefully it'll get contained. But I just don't know.
