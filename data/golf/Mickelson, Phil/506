Q.   Give us your thoughts on the start?
PHIL MICKELSON:   We had a nice day today.   It was just a little bit of wind.   It was just a beautiful day to play, and we all got off to a good start.   But Paul and I kind of let the round go a little bit, but Martin finished up strong.

Q.   How much of a factor is it that you arrived late last night and didn't play a practise round?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I've been over in Europe here last few days, so I'm on the time schedule.   I don't think that had anything to do with it. 
I think that the last two months, I've played very poorly and I added this week because I need to play a little bit more.   And I'm hoping to get a good round tomorrow so that I can play on the weekend, because I think this course is a great course to play links golf and get ready for the British Open.   It's a wonderful test, and it's a fun course to play. 

Q.   Different from last year?
PHIL MICKELSON:   There was some different tee boxes on a few holes but for the most part, very same golf course. 

Q.   You had not originally included this tournament in your schedule, what was your thinking of playing here?
PHIL MICKELSON:   We were on a family vacation here this week in Europe, and I thought that I would go over to Lytham on the weekend and spend Saturday, Sunday there and just spend a few extra days there. 
After playing poorly last week, I felt like I needed to get into a competition, and I need to get out and try to score, because I'm not just throwing one or two shots away on the golf course; I'm throwing away four, five or six, and I've got to try to get that resolved.

Q.   What's the problem?   How do you fix it? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's just one of those things, where I just make a couple of sloppy swings here and there, poor decisions, or what have you. 
I think the more I play, the better I get in the good mind‑set of focusing on each shot, which is why I added this week and I'm appreciative of the Tournament Committee, I'm glad that they had one more exemption. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
PHIL MICKELSON:   We all go through them throughout our career, and the last‑‑ it's only been three tournaments, but I've only played three events in the last six or eight weeks.   So when I have played, I haven't been in a very good tournament, competitive frame of mind and that's what I'm working on now.

Q.   Is this how you've come through previously?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I've got to go play more, got to go play more and try to shoot a score, because it doesn't feel like any one part of the game is off.   It just feels like I'm not putting it together on the golf course.   So the more I play, the better it seems to get. 

Q.   And what happened on 12?
PHIL MICKELSON:   They moved that tee box, it's a very awkward shot for me, I shouldn't have hit driver and I did.   I probably should have hit iron or 3‑wood and just try to get it in play, but went through in the hazard, and ended up dropping it in a poor lie. 

Q.   Tell us about the holiday. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   We were over in Italy, my oldest daughter is very big into Greek and Roman history, and so we have been over in Rome the last few days and they were at the Vatican today.   I was suspect posed to stay with them through Friday but I needed to get a little more play time in.
I've got the greatest wife I could ever ask for, very supportive.   In fact, she and I both had the same idea at the same time. 

Q.   Given what you said about your game, and a second last year, is it confidence or‑‑
PHIL MICKELSON:   I really have come to enjoy links golf, and I've come to play better and better at it throughout my career but I have to start executing hitting shots, because it doesn't matter how well you may know a golf course or how comfortable you may feel on a course.   Unless you're executing and hitting the shots, it doesn't matter. 

Q.   With less than a week, can you find your game?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm working on it.   That's why I'm here.   I got out here at nine o'clock to get a three‑ or four‑hour practise session in, and I'll be doing that the next few days to see if I can get it dialed in. 
I think the best way for me to get through this is to play more. 

Q.   Are you frustrated that you can't go to the Vatican?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I've been there a number of times.   Wanted to see her face, I wanted to see my daughter's face, because she's studied the history of the Vatican and Rome and so forth, but I was there when we saw a bunch of other things. 

Q.   Were you not tempted to seek some divine help maybe? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   You know, I've never been a big fan of that.   I just think that everybody is looked on equally, and so you've got to make your own destiny.
