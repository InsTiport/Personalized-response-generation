  Q.  On his play.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I got off to a poor start and I was 5 over after seven.  I thought if I could just stay close.  I had missed a couple of short putts.   
 I don't feel I've driven myself out of it as even par is going to be in the hunt tomorrow.   
 If I get out and shoot a 68, I'll be right back in it.   
 My goal was to shoot under par after being 5-over after seven.  So I made a mini-goal from that point.  There are birdies out there today.   
 I didn't drive it as well as I wanted to, but I got it done in the end.  I'm more worried about the short putts I missed.   
 Tomorrow's goal is to shoot in the 60s and I can get right back in it.   
  
  Q.  Regarding Amy (his wife) giving him a hug on number 7.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was great seeing Amy out there.  A little morale boost to keep me fighting was nice.
