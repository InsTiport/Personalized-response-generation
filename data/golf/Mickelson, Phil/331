 Q.  How many money games have you had with those guys?  PHIL MICKELSON: We had fun.  We had fun.  But all three of us were frustrated.  We had beautiful scoring conditions.  First group off and, you know, if we could have shot 7, 8, 9-under par, it probably was out there.  It was as easy as I've seen the course play.  We could have made some noise. But, you know, we're just kind of in there, just made a few birdies.  Keegan had a nice round, 3-under.  But it could have been a lot lower, and I let a lot of shots slide.   Q.  What did you think of the split tees?  PHIL MICKELSON: You know, I guess it's a weekly thing for us, so it's not like it's a big deal.  We do it every week.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he understands how each person swings and delivers the club into the ball and works with that, as opposed to trying to mold them to one idea.  And I think that's why he's able to work with guys so quickly and have them perform so well.   Q.  Were you not disappointed in the fact that this was supposed to be a tournament all about weather and the draw can determine a lot of things, and now they've made it a WGC event (inaudible.)  PHIL MICKELSON: What do you mean a WGC event?   Q.  Like Doral and Bridgestone.  They do two tees, because they want it to be as fair as possible.  This tournament isn't about fair.  PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know all that.  I'm frustrated because I've thrown so many shots away each round.  I feel like I'm playing a lot better than what I'm scoring, and that's frustrating me.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  PHIL MICKELSON: Sure, it will ease a lot of things.  Just having success in this tournament means a lot to me in the past.  But I'd like to -- getting a taste of it last year, I just want it more.  It makes me work harder, make me want to come here and play harder even more.   Q.  What do you see as the difference between Rickie this year and last year?  He seems so much more consistent this year, do you see any reason why?  PHIL MICKELSON: He's hitting the ball longer than I've ever seen him hit it.  And he's hitting more iron shots to gimme length ever every time I play with him.   Q.  Can you focus just on majors and be successful out here?  PHIL MICKELSON: Probably.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  The other events, are they just lead-ups to majors or is it something else?  PHIL MICKELSON: No, there's a lot of big events, though.  You take the four majors and you throw THE PLAYERS, that's five.  And you've got three or four WGC's, that's eight, maybe nine.  And you've got FedExCup, now you're at 13.  How many events are you going to play a year, maybe 20?  So there's not a lot of -- we have so many big events. And I think it's a great thing that you bring the top players together a lot more often.  I think if you're a viewer, that's kind of what you want.  You want to see the best players play against each other.  So it's kind of a good thing.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, my goodness.  I threw countless shots away -- not shots, opportunities away, all throughout the day.  And it's just frustrating.  But I know that it's not far off, but it's got to click.  It just hasn't yet.
