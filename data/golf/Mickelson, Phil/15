 Q.  How would you assess how the day went out there?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I was a little off today, but I'm having a lot of fun. I mean, this has really been a lot of fun. I haven't played great this year. I've missed a lot of cuts, and the next thing I know my game is starting to come back and I can sense it, and then I play two great rounds, and this is really a lot of fun.   
I'm going to come out tomorrow and give it my best to go low. I know I'm playing well enough to do that. But more than that, I'm having a lot of fun. I think I'm going to continue to start playing better and better as I continue to work on a few things.   
 Q.  Does that help when you're having fun to be able to say, okay, I know I can go low tomorrow?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It really does. We all have days where we're just a fraction off, where you think you hit a good shot and it doesn't quite work out, and I felt like I had one of those days, and then usually the next day you come back out and you put it all together. So it's not far off; I've been playing well and I'm excited and having fun to play golf.   
 Q.  If there's one thing in your game that you need to hope clicks a little better tomorrow, what would that be?  
PHIL MICKELSON: My wedge play today did not give me as many birdies opportunities as I have had the first couple of days. I've got to hit my wedges closer and then I've got to make the putts. I wasn't very connected today with the putter. My speed was way off and I didn't really take advantage of good chances.
