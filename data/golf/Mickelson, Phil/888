 Q. Totally different course out there today than we saw the rest of these rounds. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a difficult course today with the wind, and the pins were tough because they were all tucked and tough to get close because distance control was difficult with the wind. 
 But if you could take advantage of the par-5s and salvage pars on a lot of the holes, could you shoot under par or right around par and that was going to be good enough to move up the leaderboard. 

 Q.  You've got the first tournament in the books under your belt for the year.  Tell me how you feel. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I feel like I'm where I wanted to be starting the week.  I'm a week behind on my game just because I haven't been able to practice, but as the week wore on I started to play better, I started to feel better, and these two rounds under par on the weekend gives me a little bit of momentum heading into the Phoenix Open next week. 

 Q.  This morning warming up, ready for the rain, the rain never comes, then it gets warm, now it's cold and overcast.  Is that hard to play in when you're not feeling 100 percent? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't care what the weather was going to be because I just wanted a chance to play.  I was outside the Top 10.  I felt like if I could get one more round to get a little bit of momentum I could move up on the leaderboard as well as get some momentum for the weeks ahead, and now I'm really looking forward to Phoenix.  I feel like my game is starting to get sharp.  I've got a few subtle adjustments I'll work on the next few days, but I think that next week could be a good week.
