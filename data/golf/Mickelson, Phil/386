  PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm playing well but I'm making a lot of mistakes.   Yesterday that 9 on my 17th hole really hurt.   But I fought back today to get back in it, and the good news for me is that I'm playing well, making a lot of birdies, and if I can eliminate some mistakes, I should have a chance on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   You said you were frustrated last week by your golf swing but you kind of found something yesterday.   Just watching on TV to the naked eye, it looked like you played as good as you have in a while.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, I made some adjustments on my swing and I'm hitting the ball as well as I have in a long time.   It's amazing how one week can make a difference.   But I implemented some changes and have been striking the ball very solidly.   I'm also putting well and consequently I'm making a lot of birdies.   But I've had too many mistakes.   I'm going to continue to play aggressively out here, because I have to make birdies to catch the lead.   And hopefully I'll eliminate a few mistakes here or there.   
   
 Q.   When you think about it, a 71 yesterday, just looking at the score is pretty good, considering you had a 9; what's the best you've ever done along those lines?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know the history of it but the last time I made a quadruple bogey, I won the tournament, TOUR Championship, 14th hole at East Lake in 2009.   So it's an omen.
