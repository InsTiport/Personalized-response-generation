  Q. Phil, I don't know if you played bad. Rickie played awfully well out there today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, he really did. He hit a lot of great shots. And we only played 4 holes on the backside. He played them in 5-under. He was a tough opponent for me to have today. You can't help but pull for him. He's a nice guy, really is a quality individual, means a lot to American golf. And he was a real credit to the Ryder Cup team a few months ago.  
  
  Q. Speaking of that, I know you've really lobbied for him to be on that team. What was it like to be playing against him, when you had been paired with him there?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it's actually a fun challenge, you know. It's a fun challenge to take on guys that are also your teammates in the Ryder Cup, but guys you compete with week in and week out.   
 It was just one of those days. Certainly I got outplayed, that's obvious. He played some good golf. He's a talented player. I really like the guy and again, I pull for him, he's a fun guy to pull for.
