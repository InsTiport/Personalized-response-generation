PHIL MICKELSON: I just doubled 16.  I hit a bad shot and doubled.  Otherwise, I played pretty well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't think it's going to be much difference.  There's different ways to play it.  The rain may have you play it one of four ways it's been playing.  I don't think it's going to make too much of a difference.   
 Q.  Did your play today affect at all how you play tomorrow?  
PHIL MICKELSON: The hole is kind of -- it depends what hole, how you're playing, how you feel with certain shots.  There's always two or three clubs on each tee, and it comes down to how the wind is going and how it feels the best.  It really depends on the condition of the course.  I don't know what else to say.  There's no real set game plan.  There's different ways to play every hole.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think 2 or 3.   
 Q.  Anything that surprised you out there?  Did it run out fast or something like that?  
PHIL MICKELSON: No, the pins were where I thought they'd be.  The course played the way I thought it would.  It's a very fun, fair, and hard test.  It's good.  Really good.
