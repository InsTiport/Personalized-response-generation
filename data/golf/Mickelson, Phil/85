Q. We start with the most obvious news.  There is a rumor that you and Tiger might be going head-to-head in a winner-take-all $10 million match?  What are the details on that?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know what else to add to that.  The report was accurate, but I don't know what else to say.
Q. Is there any anticipation of when that date might come?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm sure as soon as we know more, we'll fill you in.  But, right now, I don't have much more to add to it.
Q. Was it your idea, his idea, or a combination of both?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know where -- I don't really have anything else to say about it, other than the stuff is accurate.
Q. Okay, how about playing this course today.  Even par on the day, how comfortable do you feel about your round out there?
PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't play great today, to be honest, but I hit a lot of good shots, but I didn't score great.  I'm getting better as the week goes on, and I'm building some momentum for my two-week stretch over in the U.K., and I'm looking forward to getting over there.  But I'd like to finish it off with a good round tomorrow.
Q. Practicing with Andrew in a pre-round routine, what is the focus usually?  Is it more mental, is it more physical that you're trying to accomplish?
PHIL MICKELSON: We've been working on some things now for about three years, and on getting my swing back on plain, the driver and the longer stuff is much easier to hit stretch, and misses are better and so forth, and that's what we've been working on.  Just making sure that I'm still on top of it.  So each day before the round we're making sure that posture, set-up, all the basics are correct.
