Q.
Just talk about these three closing holes that are getting a lot of people today.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a tough course today with the wind.  It played very difficult.  The last three holes are very tough, too.  I didn't finish the best, but hanging in there at even.
Q.  At 17, what --
PHIL MICKELSON:  I knocked it in the water, made double.  It can happen.
Q.  A lot of the guys were saying this is such an up-and-down day with the swirls.  How hard is it to stay steady on a day like today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It wasn't too hard to stay steady, you just couldn't make too many birdies other than maybe the par 5s and there were two short par 4s.  Otherwise you're fighting for par the whole day, and it was a tough challenge.

But there were some low scores out there, too; Jeff Sluman in the group in front of me played pretty well, and Sergio, the leader, he played under par.  So it was out there.
Q.  Most of the guys have been thinking putting has been the hardest with the way the greens are and where the pin placements are because of the wind.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, the greens were probably the most difficult part of the golf course I would say.
Q.  Did you put a good 6-iron on 17?
PHIL MICKELSON:  The first shot that I hit in the water, no, it wasn't that great a swing.  Jonathan Kaye hit a good shot right in the middle of the green, landed on the front third and still went in the water, so go figure.
Q.  When you have a tough day like that, is it ever hard to still keep up all the smiling and nodding with the fans calling out your name?
PHIL MICKELSON:  That stuff happens.  You're going to hit some bad shots.  It doesn't -- it's not going to upset my day, no.
Q.  When you have that many people calling out your name, do you ever get used to it?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's fun.  It's very flattering.
