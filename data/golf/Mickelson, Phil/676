 Q. I've been describing that round for about four hours, could you describe it for me?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think that I just fought hard today. I didn't play well. The golf course is very fair, very playable. We obviously saw some scores out there, and if you struck it well you could do that, you could make some birdies. 
 I didn't hit it as well as I did yesterday. So I had to fight pretty hard to get some up-and-downs. Some ridiculous up-and-downs, to keep it where I was at. To keep it within striking distance. 
 1-over in an Open is not a great spot, not a bad spot to be. I'm quite few shots back, probably more shots back than I thought I would be, but Dustin and Graeme played some great golf. But anything can happen on Sunday and if you make a move you can make up a lot of ground.
