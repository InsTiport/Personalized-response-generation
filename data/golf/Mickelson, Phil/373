Q.   I have a very important question to ask you:   Broncos or Seahawks? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I like the Seahawks today.   I think that good defense usually beats good offense, and I think that the man‑to‑man coverage that the Seahawks provide is going to make it difficult for that quick release of Manning.   I think the Seahawks are going to win.

Q.   Kind of a whirlwind of a week, going to Atlanta and back, getting your back in good shape.   How do you feel about the effort throughout the week?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I love playing this tournament.   The golf course was in impeccable shape.   It was set up as well as I've ever seen it.   The greens were rolling spectacular. 
It gave guys that played well a chance to make birdies and move up the leaderboard and guys that didn't do great things like myself struggle a bit.   I think that's what you want in a golf course setup to really reward the best players that week. 
This field and tournament and committee, the Thunderbirds, did a perfect job of setting this golf course up to allow the best players to win.
My game is not far off, even though the score says that it is.   It was just a fraction off.   My irons were what I struggled with this week, but I drove the ball well, short game wasn't bad, putting wasn't bad.   I have to go back to work on my iron play. 
Back feels great.   I'm looking forward to going to Monterey next week.

Q.   What do you take out of a week like this? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I couldn't really identify it after last week how my game stood, because I wasn't feeling like I could swing it the way I wanted to, but this week I felt like I could.   I drove the ball well, and I hit some very poor iron shots.
I'm going to go back and work on my iron play in these next couple of days and getting ready for Monterey, because I have been able to identify this week now where my strength is, where my weakness is.

Q.   Are you going to play a little football right now or never going to toss a football again?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm going to go watch some football.   There is a big game on, I don't know if you know that, in a couple of hours (laughter).

Q.   What's your schedule after Pebble?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I have two weeks off.   My kids are out of school.   They're both at different schools, so that's two different spring breaks the week of LA and Match Play.   Because I am missing LA and I like to play that week, I am going to add Honda which I normally have not played in quite a few years, but I'm excited to get back there and play this year.
