Q. Talk about what's the rest of the golf course, you haven't seen it all week long.  Talk about the beginning.  You said you were 6-under par through ten holes, if the putts would have gone as opposed to giving them.  How well are you playing compared to the last three days?
PHIL MICKELSON: We had very soft conditions this morning.  And there was no wind when we teed off.  It certainly picked up a little bit here this afternoon, but in the morning it was pristine.  You had perfect greens, a little bit of moisture.  So you had ideal scoring conditions.  And I ended up playing for a few holes under par, got off to a good start.
Q. So those good starts all throughout the week mean you're pretty much ending things from here and backwards.  Is there a little bit of a disadvantage not playing the whole golf course as you make your way through this entire process?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm certainly a little bit worried, because I know there's going to be a key match that's going to go down to the last few holes.  And I'm not as comfortable on those holes as I'd like to be.
But I love the fact that I'm able to be rested and ready to play, because I think it's helping me get off to a good start.
Q. On the scoreboard and on the comprehensive win, 4 & 3.  Talk about your start and how impressive you're playing.
PHIL MICKELSON: It was perfect conditions starting this morning.  And in the first few matches where you have such strong winds and firm greens, you're thinking about just making some pars, because birdies were -- they were very difficult.
But this morning we had perfect conditions and we knew we were going to have to make birdies to win the holes.  I was able to birdie some early holes to get off to a lead and that was a nice way to start because it got a little more difficult here in the afternoon.
Q. You've not seen 16 through 18 this week, are you actually going to go play a few before the next round or going as you are?
PHIL MICKELSON: No, I don't want to press my luck.  Certainly I'm concerned that there's going to be a critical match that comes down to those last few holes.  But I also think that the fact that I've had this extra time and be rested has helped me get off to a good start.
