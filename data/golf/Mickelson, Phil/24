 Q.  Great finish. Obviously makes the round that much better, but how would you assess your play today?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It was a good finish. I let a lot of shots slide throughout the middle of the round. My speed was a little bit off. I was very tentative with my pace because the greens were pretty quick and I just wasn't quite aggressive enough on the greens. I let a lot of opportunities slide. But I shot a 4-under par round and it's not going to hurt me. If I go out tomorrow and play well at Monterey Peninsula, I can get a hot round going and move right up the leaderboard, so that finish was very helpful.   
 Q.  Did you feel like Spyglass was, possibly this is one of the more gettable days out here?  
PHIL MICKELSON: So I drove it like a stallion and hit almost every fairway and when you're doing that you can get aggressive and get after it. And the fact that I didn't take advantage of those opportunities was disappointing, but I feel like I'll be able to continue driving it like that and if I do, I'll get my iron play fixed and roll in some more birdies.
