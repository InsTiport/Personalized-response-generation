 Q. Any issue from being in there for that period of time?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No. 

 Q. What did you struggle with off the tee today?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Off the tee didn't feel too bad. I don't feel like it cost me -- when I hit a bad drive it was playable. And the key holes, the par 5s, I hit good drives, was able to take advantage of those holes for the most part. Where I struggled -- I had a terrible day putting, just terrible. I haven't putted this bad in a long time. You cannot win golf tournaments putting like that. I'm going to do something I haven't done in a long time which is go to the practice green after a round and spend some time. I've got to get this figured out before tomorrow.

 Q. Does this have to do with what I read that they're wanting you to release the putter as opposed to hold it?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I've been working on getting the putter more to square up to release more as opposed to dragging it through. I just gotta get used to it.

 Q. What happened on 9 and 10, being there on 11 to get a birdie and pars after that?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like I'm throwing five, ,six seven shots away on the greens. It's just been difficult scoring-wise. I don't feel like I'm playing as bad as I've been scoring. So I'll go try to get that figured out, but on the greens, I missed a lot of ones that you don't even think about missing. I missed three or four of those. So I'll have to get that turned around.

 Q. 14 and 15, Phil, there's a chance to make something happen on those two holes after that birdie at No. 11. I'm sure you're not thrilled with the way you came through those two holes?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No. Especially after the drive on 15, because if I just hit a good 3-wood I could fly it well into the green. And the ball just shot left on me and ended up not getting that up-and-down.
 But that was the hole that after, again, a very good drive that I should have been able to capitalize a stroke there.

 Q. Talk about that second shot on 18, what you used and what you saw there through the trees. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Hit a 9-iron and had 167. It was not that hard a shot. Wide open gap. The tree that was in front of me was not in front of the way of the normal 9-iron. It wasn't that difficult of a shot.

 Q. Do you feel like a 66 or something like that is not that far away if you can just turn the putting around?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I felt it should have been close to that, somewhere in the mid to high 60s today if I don't throw away those little three footers here and there. I'm a few under par. Didn't make any 15-footers. Those were the key there. I had five, six, good looks at it and didn't make any of those. 
 So again on the greens is where I'll have to get it going, because the greens are great. They're in great shape. 
 David Toms, my playing partner, made a lot of putts. They're out there. I just wasn't one of the guys doing it.

 Q. Swing feel okay?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it doesn't feel bad. I feel like I hit decent shots and the bad ones weren't horrendous. So I wasn't overly disappointed. But when you miss putts it's hard to get momentum in the round. 
 And so I'll sometimes hit shots that I didn't want to hit. A lot of that can deal with just the way the momentum is going.
