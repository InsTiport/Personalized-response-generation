 Q. What was par out there today?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's hard to say. It's a tough golf course. It's a very penalizing golf course, and it's long and I think if it didn't have any rough, I think it would be awesome. If it was like Augusta, because the greens are similar to Augusta, in that they are fast and undulating; there's lots of area around the green to chip from and hit shots. 
 But because it's so long, there's not much area, and if the rough were first cut, I think this place would be impeccable.

 Q. Did you see the weather forecast before you put the white pin-striped trousers on this morning?
 PHIL MICKELSON: You know, it's always beautiful weather here in New York. This is just a rarity today and so I have to plan on it being good weather. 

 Q. How do you assess your game right now? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like I'm in the right direction. I feel like I know what I'm trying to do with the golf swing and with the short game and putting especially. I'm not scoring the way I want to. But I'm not displeased. I think that it's getting better and better, and I expect to get improved performances throughout the Playoffs. 

 Q. How do you compare today to yesterday, difficulty-wise?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's more difficult today. It's hard to say how much. But there's some holes that are very difficult.
