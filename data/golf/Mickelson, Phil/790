  Q. (On his win at Riviera:)   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Given that the first three weeks I didn't play very well, to be able to play well and end up coming out on top and playing well on the last three holes and making some birdies when I needed it, it feels great to be able to put a performance up like that when I really didn't play my best throughout the day, but when I needed to I was able to make a few birdies coming in.   
  
  Q. Obviously nice to get a win under your belt in the first round?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's nice to win the first match. I played against a very tough competitor in Angel. He probably didn't start the front nine the best, but the back nine he sure hit a lot of good golf shots and won four holes in a row there in the end. I was fortunate to win in sudden death, but I'll gladly take it.  
  
  Q. Given your form, a bit erratic the last couple of weeks, those last four or five holes being 4-up with four or five to go, did you obviously expect that or not?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, one or two of them I may have given to him, but he made three birdies, and I give him a lot of credit for really gutting it out. He made a great 10-footer on the last hole for par to extend it into sudden death, and he played some great golf. Again, I was fortunate to come out on top with somebody that was really getting hot there at the end.
