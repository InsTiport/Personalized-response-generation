  First Round 69 (-3)

 Q. Talk about how it felt playing today; nice weather.
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was fun to get back into competition. I haven't played in a month, since The Ryder Cup. It's on a golf course I enjoy very much. Could have played better, but I'll certainly take a 69 the first round and I'm looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow and trying to make more birdies.

 Q. Did you leave any shots out there? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think everybody feels like they left some shots out there. I had a couple of 3-putts that I wasn't too pleased with, but other than that, I played pretty well.

 Q. And your birdies, any of them makeable? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I started out with a birdie on 10, which is nice. But gave it back with a couple of bogeys. Turned at 1-under, though. 
 Made one good putt, about a 30-footer on 5 for birdie. That was a long putt there.

 Q. And how did you find the course?
 PHIL MICKELSON: The course is in great shape as always. It's in wonderful shape and I think the players are really enjoying it. I know I am. 

 Q. Is it good to be back?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It is.
