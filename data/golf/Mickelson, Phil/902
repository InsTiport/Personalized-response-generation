   PHIL MICKELSON:  I knew that I needed to play well, and I'm fortunate that I got off to enough of a lead that we could wrap this up early. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts after this week, getting the first American point? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It's been such a fun week for us.  I think the people in Canada treated us so well.  It's been such a fun week.  Obviously we've played well and it's been a great week camaraderie-wise.  We've all had so much fun together, a lot of good ping-pong players on this team.  We've been up late every night playing and it's really been a fun, special week. 
 I got off to a pretty good start on the front nine with some birdies and carried it over to the back which was nice because we were losing momentum there for a while.  Although we had a big lead, it was important that we kept the momentum going. 

 Q.  You had an opportunity for eagle. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I did.  I hit a good shot, hybrid in there about 20, 25 feet.  Had a chance to win the hole with an eagle and I got lucky that Vijay missed his 15-footer for birdie and still won the hole so, it didn't matter. 

 Q.  To say that you dominated would be a little bit of an understatement, you were 0-3-3 coming in.  Congratulations on the first one. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  What do you mean? 

 Q.  In singles you were 0-3-3 in the Presidents Cup.  And you dominated today. 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't know that was the record, but it is nice to get a win.  I was excited to have a chance to play against Vijay.  I got off to a pretty good start.  Even though I lost the first hole I made some birdies after that.  It was a fun match and I feel like I played well and had control for quite a long time. 

 Q.  You had five birdies on the day today and you were only through 14 holes.  How good you feeling about how good you are hitting it? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I hit some good shots today and that was a fun match.  It was a fun match because even though we had a big lead on the board, there was a lot of blue and we needed to get a little bit of momentum so it was fun to finish this match early. 

 Q.  Now are you going to shut it down for a while? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Looking forward to that, absolutely.  Looking forward to some off-time. 

 Q.  (About spikes. ) 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I started practicing in soft spikes and started playing in soft spikes in my practice round and didn't switch -- what I found was it felt better on my back.  It just felt a little bit easier after walking on soft spikes than metal. 
 Now, I still plan on using metal a bunch next year, but I just thought this is a chance for me, I'm playing 36, playing five matches over the Presidents Cup, I thought it would just be long-term a better idea to play soft spikes.  I only had one shot this week where I slipped, and so that's encouraging. 
 When I swing harder at it, I've been all over the place in the past and now I'm able to maintain better balance.
