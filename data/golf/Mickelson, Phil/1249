PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a weird round.  Up and down all day.  All in all, it evened out and I'll take a 72. It got better at the end of the day.  We got a break on the tee times.  It was much easier when we got out there.  It started to back down on the back nine.  On 12, I was trying to make one birdie to get a streak going.  I hit an L-wedge from 68 yards and then made two birdies after that.  That all fell apart on 16.  I hit a 2-iron into the water.  I thought it would get to the green.  It didn't come out as well.  It wasn't a bad lie, even though it was in the water.  Finishing on 18, there's a mental block in being over par after the round.  Getting to even par makes me feel better about my day.  At the start, even par would have been a disappointment, but I'll take it considering how the round went.


Q.  How long were your birdie putts on 13 and 14?

PHIL MICKELSON:  Birdie putt at 13 was 12 feet and on 14 it was 20 feet.
