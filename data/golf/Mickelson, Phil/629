 Q. 69, are you pleased? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought that the round could have been a lot better, but towards the ends I birdied three of the last five holes coming in. So I probably got as much out of the round there towards the end as I could have. 
 But throughout the course of the day, I had many opportunities to go low and I didn't take advantage of them. I've got to go really low tomorrow to give myself a chance. 

 Q. The way the course is playing, hard and fast, is that a possibility?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think that it is. You'll have to make a lot of putts and you'll have to play some good golf. But I remember that it's been done in the past and if myself or somebody out in front of the lead can get a hot round going, it will be tough. 

 Q. The shot on 16?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It wasn't having to go around the tree, it was just trying to get the ball to curve to the right that was a challenge.
