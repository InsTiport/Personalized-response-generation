Q.
You had seven, eight holes left?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm on the 1st hole and had a 20 footer for birdie.
Q.  Six shots back, but you made up a couple of strokes before the third round?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I shot a couple under on the backside there with a couple of mistakes, but I was able to keep it 2 under.  And the goal tomorrow is to try to get as low as I can on the front, see if I can get three or four birdies and get myself back in the tournament heading into the second half.
Q.  As far as the golf course, playing obviously a little longer and a little softer?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, and I think the softness has led to the lower scores, because we're able to get to a lot of the pins.  The greens don't have the normal speed that roll the ball six, eight feet by, and it plays much more aggressive.
