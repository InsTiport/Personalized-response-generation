 Q.  Just an overall assessment of this week.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Interesting.  It's been an interesting week.  I don't know what it is about this golf course, too, I just -- it's pristine shape, it's wonderful setup, it's terrific, and I just don't play well.  I don't know what to say.   
 Q.  Is there any concern as you go, as you're heading towards Magnolia Lane about where your form is right now?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Sure, I missed two cuts in a row so that's not very encouraging.  But I've got next week off.  I'll go home, get a little rest and work a few things out.  But for me the biggest thing has been putting, I just haven't been putting anywhere near like I did last year and I just got to get that back.  If I do I'll be in good shape and I got plenty of time to turn it around.   
 Q.  Have you decided on Match Play?  
PHIL MICKELSON: So it be will either Match Play or Valero.  And most likely Match Play, but I haven't decided yet.  I'll make that decision this week.   
 Q.  What's happened since Pebble?  I mean, you obviously had such a good tournament there and even before that, a couple of good events.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I don't know what to say.  I mean I don't know what to say.  I haven't played well the last three events, so I don't know.  I don't feel like it's far off.  I actually felt like I hit a lot of good shots this week, but I'm having some trouble with the putter and I'll have to work that out.   
 Q.  Anything about what happened yesterday bother you out on the golf course at all?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, it's, you know, I'm used to taking hits, but it hurts when you have your kids being questioned over doing nothing but working hard and studying hard, so, but we're going to be okay.
