Q. That seemed kind of fun?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was great. It was a lot of fun. And it's fun to finish off the round. It's fun to make a good par save on 17 and birdie the last. It's fun to finish a good round off rather than leak one here or there coming in. So it was a good day. 

Q. After 11, Phil, you went to even there, dropped a stroke. 
PHIL MICKELSON: It looked like after bogeying 10 and 11 that that's not‑‑ that would kill some momentum. It was the other way around, because I made two great bogeys that should have and could have been doubles. After going in the water at 11 to hit that close and have an easy bogey and then to make a 6‑footer for bogey on 10 after a terrible drive, those were almost momentum maintainers, if you will, that kept me in it. And then when I got to the holes that I could birdie I took advantage of it with some good shots.

Q. Did you feel early on that 67 was out there?
PHIL MICKELSON: I was just hoping to shoot in the 60s. I thought‑‑ yeah, I thought there were some 66s out there. Look, the greens are softer than they've ever been, and they're not as fast as they normally are. So today was a day to take advantage of it. I'm sure they'll get firmer and faster as the week goes on. But you could get after the pins and you could putt aggressively.

Q. What did you hit into 18 there?
PHIL MICKELSON: Wedge. 

Q. To finish with a birdie like that, how much momentum did that get you? It looked like you were really strutting when you came off that green?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I wanted to finish the round off. I hit a poor drive just left on 17 and ended up getting up and down, making about a seven or eight footer for par. And that was a great momentum builder for me to finish off the round. You have a good round going you hate to let one leak here or there coming in and I didn't do that today. I finished it off.
