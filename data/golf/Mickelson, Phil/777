  Q. Was today what it could have been?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'll tell you, I wasn't really even thinking about winning starting out. The course is playing very difficult. The wind is picking up and it's very challenging. I had some of the best shots of the day the last three, four holes and still was not able to make birdies. It's a very challenging test with the wind, the firm greens.   
 Again, I never really thought about winning until the last four or five holes.  
  
  Q. Besides the lay out, though, definitely anything can happen the latter part of the day?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think so. There's certainly birdies out there. You can birdie 10 and 13 and 14. There are some tough holes, though. That's 12th hole with that pin is going to be very difficult. And 17 is very difficult. 18 is a challenge. I think the finish is -- the guys are going to come back. You're going to have to make your birdies through the first 15 holes.   
  
  Q. What will you do now?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm going to head back to the hotel and pack up, get ready to go when my wife and kids get here, and I'll come back here and probably watch the last hour or so.  
  
  Q. What kind of shot was 14 for you today? What did you play there?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: The drivable par-4? The wind is left to right, and you can reach it, you certainly can reach it. With 3-wood, driver, the challenge is the pin is right by a little swale on the right. So if you go right, it's very difficult to get it close; to get it within 12, 15 feet you have to hit a remarkable shot. And that's the challenge.   
 You can't really take on the left side of the green because of the water, so although that's a birdie hole, you're going to have to hit a remarkable second shot or an incredible tee shot to actually get it on the surface to make birdie there. But it's doable.  
  
  Q. Does the tee make the hole there or the hole location?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, the hole location is what's challenging there, not because of the water. There's a swale short right that's deflecting balls from getting close on these firm greens and you can't fly it to the hole because the greens are firm.  
  
  Q. Finishing up today the way you did, how much of a springboard is it for you for next week?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's good momentum to go into next week. I knew I was playing well. Yesterday's round was disappointing. I wish I was out there playing in some of the latter groups with a chance to win. But I enjoyed playing today with Jeff Maggert, I enjoyed getting a good round and hitting some good shots, making some key putts, feeling the pressure. You know, the last hole I had a four-footer and I had pressure on that. That's cool. I haven't been in a tournament the last couple weeks, and it was fun to feel that.
