Q.   Was there any disappointment?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I wanted to make a run and just didn't.  I tried to.  I was 1 under, went for the green on 8, put it in the water, put it in the water on 9.  So it was a disappointing round.

But I had a good time this week.  I'm starting to play this golf course a little bit better.  I played it well last year and played it okay this year.

I'm looking forward to coming back here for the World Golf Championships.
Q.  When you start the day four back, do you play any differently, do you feel that you have to press it a little bit?
PHIL MICKELSON:  You try not to.  You have to make birdies.  I just had a hard time doing that today.
Q.  Can you put in perspective what Tiger has been able to do with the lead?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, he's a tough guy to overcome when he's got the lead, absolutely.
Q.  When you've done that before, do you actually play differently with the lead?
PHIL MICKELSON:  You try not to.  You try to play the same way that got you into the lead.  That's kind of the main thing.
Q.  When you came up 18 and finished out, the crowd was obviously in your favor.  Do you notice from a South Florida standpoint that this place really loves you?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I thought the people here were tremendous.  The way they responded to Tiger, the way they responded to Villegas, the way they responded to a lot of the players really makes us feel welcome.  I enjoy coming here.  It's been a fun tournament and I'm really happy that there's a World Golf Championships that is brought here, as sad as I am that Ford is leaving.
