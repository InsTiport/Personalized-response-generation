PHIL MICKELSON:  It obviously wasn't the results I wanted today.  I felt like I played well for four days and was pleased with that and hopefully will have a good tournament next week in Atlanta and get momentum for Atlanta.

The golf course was set up challenging today and we certainly tried to make a run, but it was tough to do it.
Q.  You went to Augusta early last year and got acquainted with it.  Are you going to do the same thing this week?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, I'm off to Augusta tonight and spend Monday and Tuesday on the course and getting prepared for The Masters and then I'll head to Atlanta for the Pro Am Wednesday.
Q.  What has been your experience here as compared to years past?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I enjoy coming here; we had wonderful accommodations.  And it's been a wonderful town to host the event.
Q.  How did the course play today compared to Augusta?
PHIL MICKELSON:  They're the same grass, they're the same contours and comparable speed.  Maybe not quite as fast, but pretty close.  That challenge of getting the ball to the lag putt, and hitting the ball close and up and downs, very similar shots to what we play in Augusta.
