 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I was playing well and hit a lot of greens, but it was frustrating because I was over par.   
The golf course was, there's a lot of birdies out there.   It's soft, there's just a lot of birdies out there.   And to ‑‑ yeah, it's a little disappointing and frustrating.   
   
 Q.   Any explanation?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know.   I don't know.   I don't feel like any parts of the game are bad, I just have a hard time seeing the ball go in the hole and getting it to go in the hole.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I'm not really sure.   I don't know if it's just the greens or what, but I'm not really sure what it is yet.   
   
 Q.   What was it that caused you to take that drop there?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was buried under the lip.   
   
 Q.   What's the mentality going into tomorrow?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Come out and try to play as hard as I can and see how low I can shoot.   But I'm not real worried about it, it's just not quite clicking right now.
