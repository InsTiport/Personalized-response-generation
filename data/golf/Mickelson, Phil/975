Q.  Is it just a hard game to try to push it because you have just a small margin for error?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know what to say about that, but it was a fun week here at Medinah.  It's a great golf course.  And everybody had a lot of fun.

I like the way it was set up where it was very fair.  You could make some birdies.  Hit some bad shots, you're going to make some bogeys.  I thought there was some great play out there amongst a lot of guys, and obviously Tiger played some great golf.
Q.  Just couldn't get it going today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I struggled with the putter all week and had a hard time making some birdies.  I just didn't make very many putts.

But again, you know, I had a good time this week.  I fought hard the first couple of rounds when I didn't have it and hung in there heading into the weekend.  Just Tiger's play, I wasn't able to catch that obviously.
Q.  Can you put into perspective, 12 majors and he's 30 years old and about to, not quite celebrated his 10th anniversary out here.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's pretty good.
Q.  His current stretch now since the U.S. Open, does that remind you or is it comparable to his big stretch in 2000 2001?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know if I could really compare but both of them are very impressive.
Q.  Were there tougher conditions out there today?  Did that have anything to do with how you played?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I didn't think conditions were any tougher.  Maybe there was a little more wind but that wasn't really affecting.  I didn't think it was going to affect play too much.  Just didn't play that well.
