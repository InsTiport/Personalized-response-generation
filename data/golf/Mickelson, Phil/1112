Q. Maybe not what you had in mind?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I knew I was rusty.  I knew that I wasn't playing well.  The first round was the round that concerned me.  I've got Rick Smith coming in tonight.  We are going to work all day tomorrow but that was pre planned.

I was worried about the first round because the little things I wasn't doing well.  Like the couple 3-putts I had, a couple of fluffed chips, little things like that that you need to do well to score.  So I'll spend a day working with Rick to see if we can get some of the short game in line and some of the ball-striking.
Q.  New equipment a factor?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I really love it.  I was impressed with the way the ball reacted in the wind.  I'm really excited about it.  I just wish I had worked into the irons maybe a little bit sooner, maybe the putter, too, because I didn't hit a lot of iron shots very crisply, and the putter certainly hurt.
Q.  Do you have to play defensively because of the wind?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it was tough.  It was a tough day today.  I don't know what else to say other than if you played well, you could score well.  But again, I just didn't really putt well and I did hit some very crisp shots into greens.
Q.  Can you get it back that quickly, with Rick coming in?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, obviously, I'm way off of the lead.  But there's no reason why I couldn't shoot four or five, 6-under par and forget about the lead for the time being, just get back to playing well.  I think that the next round to be a pretty good round because it doesn't feel too far off.
Q.  Chances are you may not get that whole round in tomorrow.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Oh, no, no.  We'll get seven, eight, nine holes in tomorrow and then we'll come back Saturday morning and finish up.
Q.  Tough to build momentum?
PHIL MICKELSON:  No, it's actually a plus for me.  It gives me all day to spend with Rick and just get a little bit more time practicing.
