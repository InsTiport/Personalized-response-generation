  PHIL MICKELSON:   I love Pebble Beach, I've played well there and I'm only one good round away.   If I can shoot something in the mid 60s I'll be right there for Sunday's round which is what I care about.

Q.   You're only six back now. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   That's it.   And I'm one of the first groups off so I should have the best green conditions that I've had this week.   If I play a good round tomorrow, and I feel like I'm not far off, I will hopefully put myself in position where a good round on Sunday can get the job done. 
I had a good round going here at Spyglass and I turned a 66 into a 71.   Tomorrow, I've got to finish it off.   I've got to finish off the round and see if I can put something in the mid 60s and get in it for Sunday.   Gosh, it's so much fun having a chance to win here on Sunday. 

Q.   Bogeys on three out of the four holes, what happened on those? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Nothing huge.   I just hit a poor wedge to the left on 2 and didn't get up‑and‑down.   Missed a 4‑footer. 
4 always gives me problems off the tee there.   Just hit my second shot short, didn't get that up‑and‑down and hit in the front bunker on 5 and didn't get up‑and‑down. 
So I let a few shots slide there. 
For the third, I had a hillside right behind my ball and I could barely get contact, so rather than blow it over the green, I didn't realize that it was not shaved, the left side of the green, like it has been years past and got up‑and‑down just short and made 5.   I didn't really have a chance to make 4 there. 
And yet, today was the best I rolled it.   I hit some of the best putts I've hit all week.   I hit them solid and I hit them on my line and they went over the lip and didn't go in.   I didn't feel bad.   I wasn't limping them up there.   I was aggressive.   They all had chances.   They all had good pace and they all were online but didn't quite get them in.

Q.   With the rain last night did that change much? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was softer but it was hard to compare because I didn't see Spy before.   It was in good shape.   The greens were the best I've seen them and the course was in great shape.

Q.   The air seems to be heavier‑‑
PHIL MICKELSON:   It usually is.   These courses play the longest that we play on TOUR, because of the thick, heavy air; it's cold, ball doesn't go far.   But it doesn't take long to adjust to it.   The guys out here know how to adjust to it pretty quickly but we are hitting a lot more club. 
The key is going to be taking advantage of holes you should make birdie on, the long par 5s, short par 4s.   You have to birdie those holes to get it close and make some of those short putts. 
But, you know, I've played Pebble Beach well in the past and there are some low scores out there.   There's no reason why I shouldn't shoot one tomorrow, and it's nice that I have the next two rounds at Pebble.
