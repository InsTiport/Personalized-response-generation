  Q.  Talk a little bit about the conditions today and how it played.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  With the rain and the softer greens, guys were able to make a lot of birdies and we saw some low scores today, plus there was no wind, so it was much easier conditions and a lot of guys went low.   
  
  Q.  What are you going to have to do tomorrow to get yourself back in the golf tournament?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I'd have to shoot a very low round, probably 8- or 9-under par.
