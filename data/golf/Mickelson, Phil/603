  Q. Eagle 16, birdie 17, looked like it was going in on 17. Just your thoughts on the round and how you're feeling going into tomorrow?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I had a good finish until that bogey on 18. That eagle on 16 and birdie on 17 got me into position where I thought you never know what might happen on Sunday.   
 So I've got to go low. I've got to shoot 8 or 9-under. But I'm going to try to make a run. It will be tough, but I'm going to give it a shot.  
  
  Q. The golf course after the rain today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Played a lot easier because it was so much softer. But there was some wind, so it played a lot longer as well. So it was harder to reach the par-5s, but easier to get the irons stopped close.
