Q.
Good round today.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Thank you.
Q.  A little bit of everything going.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, it was a good round.  I was very pleased.  I think the thing I was most pleased with was that when I made a mistake like I did let's say on the first hole, I was able to let it go and come back and make a couple of birdies.  So I thought that I was able to let go of some of the bad shots and capitalize on some of the good ones.  It was a fun day.
Q.  Did you feel like when you gave up ground and made it back, would you charge back with another birdie?
PHIL MICKELSON:  The way I see it is everybody is going to make mistakes on this golf course.  It's a tough test, and if you don't hit it just perfect, you're going to make mistakes.  I think the thing I was most pleased with was when I did make a mistake, I was able to let it go.
Q.  Coming off 18 obviously with the eagle and getting it to 8 at the turn, how high were you at that point?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I thought if I could shoot even par the front nine, that would be a good way to finish up the round.  Those first seven holes are some of the toughest we have.  You've got to make your move on the back nine.  I was able to do that, and I thought if I could shoot some good solid shots I'd be okay.  I didn't start off the best, which makes shooting even par that much better.
Q.  A lot of guys don't admit that they put a lot of emphasis on majors, but you do admit that.  Given that, going into the weekend with the lead, something you've had in the PGA before, what's your mindset now?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It makes no difference if I'm leading or if I'm behind.  I think that right now the biggest thing for me is that I've gained a lot of confidence in the three weeks leading up to this tournament.  I've certainly gained confidence this week as the first two rounds have been played, and I love the golf course, feel comfortable on it.

So whether I'm ahead or behind, I feel like I should be able to play the course effectively.  If the pins are in a low spot and the greens are soft, maybe I can attack and make some birdies.  Or if the course firms up or plays tougher, maybe I'll have to play more conservative and play for par.  I don't know what score it's going to take, I know I feel more confident heading into the weekend.
Q.  Would you be describe the galleries?  They seemed to be massive around you today.
PHIL MICKELSON:  This is a great place to hold major championships.  The people here support this event just tremendously, and I had one of the greatest experiences that I've had in '02 at Bethpage, and I just love playing in front of the galleries here.  The people here are tremendous.
