 Q.   How do you assess this week?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I really enjoyed my time here.   I had a great week where the course was wonderful.  
And I really enjoyed my stay here, right here on the premises, what a development Mission Hills is.   Having a chance to go into Hong Kong, a city I've been wanting to go to for some time now and had a chance to go in there after Friday's round, really enjoyed my time here.   
I think it's just a wonderful tournament.   I'm happy that next year it's going to be part of our FedExCup.   
   
 Q.   I presume you felt the excitement, the energy, the buzz in the final round having the opportunity.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's been really cool.   I've been starting to play some good golf since the PGA Championship, and it was good for me to come back after having not played since The Ryder Cup in the last month to pick up where I left off.   
I'll go down to Singapore tonight and participate in the Barclays Singapore Open next week and see if I can improve one spot here.   
   
 Q.   How aware were you of what Ian Poulter was doing?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I saw what he was doing.   I was aware.   I knew I needed to make some birdies.   The pins are very tough to get close to with the greens not holding that well.   
So I tried to carve a few shots in to some of the pins and wasn't able to get close enough to them to make birdies to catch him.   But he played really well, and I felt like these four days, I played some good golf and I'll hopefully improve on it next week.   
   
 Q.   You're not going to beat yourself up over 17, are you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   No.   It was just the worst swing of the week, actually, was that 8â€‘iron but it was a very tough pin to get to that I felt like I needed to make birdie.   At the time I was two back and trying to make a two.
