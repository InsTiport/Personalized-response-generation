 Q.   Phil, 4-under par, 68.   Just comment on your final round and the week as I whole if you can.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a fun week.   This is really a premiere stop for us on Tour.   It's so well run and supported by the community that the number of people that come out here is astounding and we sure enjoy our time here in Charlotte and are appreciative of what Johnny Harris created here.  
   
 Q.   You said on Wednesday you felt pretty good about your game.   How do you feel about it?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I had a good week as far as building momentum and improving the areas that I needed to work on.   I really worked hard on my short putts and putted those phenomenal.   I really hit them solid and made a lot of them.   
Started to drive it better but more than that get my iron shots close to the hole, work it into those pins, making -- I made a lot of birdies this week.   That's important.   
Now, the last step for me is to eliminate some mistakes.   I had a lot of reckless bogies and loose bogies and darn last hole has my number.   It was a good week.  
   
 Q.   How much do you keep yourself on that hole --  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a very difficult hole for me.   If I take it to the left I have to hit driver to carry the water and then if I don't I go in the water.   If I pull it like I did today I go in the bunker up against the lip.   I have to wedge out.   If I try to play short the fairway runs off into the rough.   
For me, I don't know -- I don't know how to play it.   Everybody else has to, too.   It just has my number.  
   
 Q.   You've been here a lot of times.   What do you think about what Rory McIlroy is doing to this course?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's impressive.
