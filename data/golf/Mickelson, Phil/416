Q.   You have waited an awfully long time for your first victory in the Home of Golf, and I just wonder what it means to you. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it's very special for me to have some success over here.   It's been the biggest challenge of my career, adapting to links‑style golf, and this was a great challenge for me this final round in some difficult conditions on firm ground to play some good golf, although spotty golf.   I played some good golf to come out on top, and this is really fulfilling and special.

Q.   You've done the hard part, found yourself four shots hype after the double bogey at the first and we thought you were going to tie it all up at the 72nd and then you take us into the GrÃ©gory Havret country six years ago; were memories of that playoff flooding into your mind at that point?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Hazel, nobody likes a movie that's predictable.   You always want to have a little bit of suspense.   I don't know what happened on the last hole.   I just lost a little bit of focus and ran that first putt by.   Thought I hit a decent putt but just misjudged it.   To come out and refocus and get ready for the playoff and make a four on a very difficult hole, I feel good.

Q.   After the heartbreaking runner‑up at Merion a few weeks ago, I wonder how satisfying it is to bounce back like this. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it feels really good.   But I knew that I had been playing well and that my game felt really good, and it feels as prepared as possible on these difficult conditions, and I hit a lot of good shots that I'm pleased on but also hit some shots that I've got to work on heading into next week.

Q.   I know in 2006 you won the week before you went on to win the Green Jacket at the Masters, is another back‑to‑back possible do you think?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I certainly hope so.   It's been‑‑ I don't think there's a better way to get ready for a Major Championship or an Open Championship than playing the week before, playing well the week before and getting into contention, and coming out on top just gives me more confidence. 
But there's a lot that's involved in the British Open.   You need some luck; you need some luck with your tee times, and you need to play well and have some good bounces.
