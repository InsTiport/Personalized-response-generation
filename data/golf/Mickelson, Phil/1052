Q.  After the first six holes, what are you telling yourself, keeping your composure?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it was a tough start, and I was not off to the best start there with three bogeys.  Guys were making birdies and I thought that I played very well and kind of gutted it out to stay in the lead.  I ended up playing the last 11 holes bogey free with one birdie and I had a chance on 17 and 18 to get the round back to even par which would have been nice.  I felt like I fought hard to stay in the lead.
Q.  Considering where you ended up and how hard you grinded, how do you assess the play and looking forward to tomorrow?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it's going to be a fun day tomorrow.  There's going to be a lot of guys right there who have a good chance, and it's going to take a good round and I'll be pulling up the rear there and hopefully playing well doing it.
Q.  Are you pleased that, because you do still share the lead after a round like this?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Absolutely, it's a boost to still be in the lead after I got off to a poor start, guys were attacking and making birdies.

Thomas BjÃ ¶rn shot 7 under I saw Davis in front of me making birdies.  To still be in the lead is a big bonus.
Q.  You had 12 birdies the first couple of days, what kept you from being able to attack and make those today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  That's a good question.  Some putts just didn't fall like they did.  Some putts came really close, and I missed a couple of short ones, not too short.  They were tough but still could have made them on 17 and 18, that would have brought it back to even.  Otherwise, I felt like it was a struggle a little bit, but I fought hard to stay in the lead.
Q.  What does the lead give you psychologically, what edge, if any?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably the biggest thing is just playing in the last group knowing what guys are doing in front of me, what I have to do, and hopefully doing it.
