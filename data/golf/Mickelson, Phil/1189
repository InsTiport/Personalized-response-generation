Q.   Just some comments on your play today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  We played well enough to win but so did Niclas and Padraig.  They both played well enough to win as well.  It was a wonderfully fought match.  David Toms, my partner had a number of wonderful shots starting at the first two holes to give us a two-up lead but we didn't relinquish throughout the day and given that our teammates stuggled ahead of us, it was a point that we knew we needed and I'm sorry that it had to go to 18 and be that close.  But we're fortunate to walk away with the point.

Q.   Just some quick comments on the crowd, the gallery.
PHIL MICKELSON:  The people have been wonderful.  Very fair.  They've been wonderful.

Q.   Birdieing the first two holes really helped?
DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, it settled the nerves a little bit.  And then -- I thought we teamed well together.  The theme for the day was that he told me to make birdie and he was going to make another one to catch up with me on the next hole.  He said keep making them and I'll keep topping you so we just wanted to try to make birdies.  That's the mindset we got into and that helped us because I think we shot 9 under par and   
only won 1-up.  So we had to play well to win.  And we why able to do that.

Q.   How about the play of (inaudible).
DAVID TOMS:  You know, Padraig wasn't quite as consistent as he normally is but Niclas Fasth was right there and made some great putts and really kept them in the match the first 12 or 13 holes or so and then Padraig came on at the end and started making birdies and they were tough.  They were a great team.

Q.   And finally just some thoughts about your first Ryder Cup match?
DAVID TOMS:  Well, I said to Phil on numerous occasions out there how much fun I was having.  It was a great experience and I just want to continue to play well.
