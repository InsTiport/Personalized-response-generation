   PHIL MICKELSON: It was a great day to score. The course couldn't be playing any better, and I got off to a poor start, 4-over. So I had to fight to get back just to make the cut.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about making the cut? Do you think you will make the cut?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it will most likely be 2, possibly 3, but that should be it for sure.  
  
  Q. What did you do to bring the round back specifically?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Stopped hitting bad shots, started hitting good ones. Yeah, that was the biggest key, I think. There was no real magic. I just got off to a poor start and just kind of hung in there and ended up making some birdies to turn it around. But the course is playing perfect, and we saw some good low scores, and it's really a fun golf course to play.   
  
  Q. Are you going to the Red Sox game tonight?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm planning on it, yes.
