 Q. So what do you think of the position that you put yourself in? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I would like to be in better shape. Obviously I would like to be closer to the lead. But I'm in 22nd spot, and a good round tomorrow can get me back in it for Sunday, which is the goal.

 Q. They are going to probably make the greens even faster and try to make it tougher for you, I would think. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: The course will probably get a little tougher. But there are a lot of birdie holes out there. I just need to eliminate the mistakes. 
 I'm making plenty of birdies to score low. I just have to eliminate some mistakes.

 Q. Has your lack of familiarity with the course been a factor? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't feel like it has been. I just feel like I've hit some poor shots around the greens and so forth. I think the golf course is in wonderful shape and the players are really enjoying it. 

 Q. Do you think being familiar with the course now will help you shape your shots better going into the weekend? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It will. It's a course where some pin placements can be tough to get to or tough holes can be birdie holes when they are in the right spots. I'll try to go out tomorrow and try to make a lot of birdies and get back in it for Sunday.

 Q. Surprised the way Harrington played? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, a little bit. He's such a good player; for him to have an off-day is awkward to see. He'll come back next week and play well. He probably just needs a couple of down days to get rested and get his game back.
