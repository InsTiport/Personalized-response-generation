 Q.   How was your round?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   You know what, I putted poorly today and I drove it horrific and the chipping was below average.  
   
 Q.   Other than that?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   And so I shot 3‑over.   You know, this is a very playable course with the soft conditions and the soft greens and so forth.   And if you keep the ball in the fairway, you can make birdies.   And I hit it terribly.   I hit it in the rough.   And the rough is not very playable.   And you've got to keep it into the fairway, end of story.   I hit some bad long irons and I've got‑‑ in fact, I'm going to go work on it.   
Very rare I hit golf balls after the round.   I've got to hit golf balls after the round.   Butch saw something, and hopefully we'll get it figured out for tomorrow.   If you get the ball in the fairway off the tee you can shoot a low score here.   If I can get it in play off the tee, I can get a low round going tomorrow, but that was just terrible.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.   And I was off to a good start.   I was hitting some good shots early.   And had a few rough holes when I got it in the rough.   And it was just a tough day for me when I was not hitting the ball in the fairway off the tee.  
   
 Q.   How bizarre was that circumstance (inaudible)?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, in fact I was actually looking four inches from it for three minutes, and I couldn't find it.   But that's the way the rough is here, and you just can't go in it.   And I kept going in it.  
   
 Q.   How do you assess the conditions as you continued on?   Did they seem to get a little bit worse?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I still thought even with the soft greens and so forth, it's just a much easier golf course with the soft conditions.   The ball doesn't run out into the fairways and go into the bunkers.   The greens you can get aggressive with and make some birdies.   But you've got to be in the fairway to do it and I just wasn't.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's what I do in the bad weather when it's rainy, because I don't lose traction, it also keeps my hands warm.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You said Butch spotted something.   What did it feel like to you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It just felt a touch off.   When I'd hit one solid, it was a pull‑hook.   And we're going to go work on it and see if we can get it fixed.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I laid up with a 9‑iron.   I missed the fairway by four yards and I had a very difficult situation and ended up making 7.   You just can't afford to do that.   Even with a 9‑iron you've got to be able to keep it in the short grass.  
   
 Q.   Does it feel like a little tweak here and there and then you'll be ready?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Hopefully.   Hopefully.   But I have not played well for a while, so I'm not sure if this is a long‑term thing or short‑term or what, so we'll see.   At least I have a little bit of a‑‑ I feel like I might have some direction for tomorrow.
