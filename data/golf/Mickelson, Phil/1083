Q.
Can you just describe what it's like, particularly the last several holes when the wind is like this?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's a tough day today obviously, and it's going to be an exciting finish.  I haven't seen the lead, but with those last three holes there, there's going to be some lead changes.
Q.  Are you going to play this week?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Most likely, yes.  Now that we got it in today, I'll go to Augusta, play tomorrow, and should make it to Atlanta in time for Wednesday.
Q.  How would you describe the conditions out there today, Phil, as tough as you've ever seen at this tournament?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's difficult, but I thought with being able to get the mud off the ball in the fairway and give yourself a good lie and the greens were receptive, I didn't think it was unfair.  I had a couple of times where I replaced the golf ball and the ball rolled 15 feet away because it caught a gust of wind, but that's kind of to be expected when you have greens this fast.

So that was maybe the only thing.  I didn't think it was unfair, though, in any way.
Q.  Can you get any preparation in for Augusta when you're playing such a disjointed week like this has been?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Probably not too much, no.
Q.  You said most likely, that means you're definitely not playing Bell South?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm most likely going to play, I'm planning on it.  Now that we finished today it should be no problem.
Q.  After this weekend is there any one thing you're going to be focused on going into Augusta, these next couple weeks?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, this course is obviously a lot different than Augusta, and around the greens here we're hacking out of thick rough.  At Augusta we're going to be able to be playing it from tight lies.  I didn't get any chance to hit any putts from off the greens here, which is the shot of choice for me in two weeks at Augusta.  So I haven't had a chance to practice that, and I intend to do that a lot this week.

In Atlanta, too, we're able to do that.  I'll probably practice it there.
Q.  Was there any part of your game this week that you're more bummed out about than any other?  Seemed like your driving wasn't where you wanted it to be.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Not overly.  I played pretty decent, I thought, with the exception of 17, where I was 6 over today, otherwise I'm reasonable under par.
Q.  You and Tiger, Vijay, Ernie, the so-called Big Four, Retief, maybe five, you look at the records and you guys haven't had an overwhelming amount of success on this course and this tournament.  Any reason why?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't know.  I don't know why, no.
Q.  17, was this a better hole in this wind?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It requires an element of luck to have the wind right, but everybody has got to play it, and absolutely, it's fair.

Thanks, guys.
