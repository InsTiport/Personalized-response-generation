Q. Very well played.  What a good win in the end.  You just got the momentum near the end?PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it was one of the better matches that we've played in that until the 17th, until Stephen bogeyed the 17th, we didn't have a bogey.  We had a number of birdies.  I thought we both played some really good golf. I was just fortunate to have a great break on 15.  That was a shot to get close was, I thought, impossible and yet it got the perfect bounce and I was able to make birdie.Q. Was it a matter of your experience?PHIL MICKELSON: No, it was just that I made an extra birdie or two coming down the stretch.  That birdie on 15 and 16 is what ultimately did it for me. The birdies that Stephen made on 11 and 12 -- I'm sorry, 10 and 11 were extraordinary, and I had a hard time kind of stabilising the match and was fortunate to keep it at even until I made those birdies.Q. It's an important, another point for the USA?PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, it's a good point.  And again, we're fighting an uphill battle heading into today, but you never know.
