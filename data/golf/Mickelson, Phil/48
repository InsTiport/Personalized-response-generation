PHIL MICKELSON: The first eight holes I let a few shots slide, and then the last ten I picked up quite a few shots.  All in all, it was a good day.   
 Q.  What kind of changes did you make as you kind of turned to the back nine?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I just wasn't putting well the first eight holes, and Tim, my brother, noticed that I was kind up and out of it a little bit, so made a slight adjustment, and I made four really good putts on 9, 10, 11 and 12.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts when before you went out you saw 7-under on the board?  
PHIL MICKELSON: That was a heck of a round.  I mean, it was a heck of a round, but you just can't get caught up in that because it's such a difficult test that if you don't stay in the moment, you'll make a big number.   
 Q.  What's your mentality going out tomorrow morning?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Going out tomorrow, I feel like I'm playing well.  I feel good about my game, and I feel like I'm playing well enough to shoot a low round out there.  I feel like I can shoot something in the mid 60s, whether it's tomorrow or the weekend.  You know, I feel like I can do it.   
 Q.  It looked like there on 18 you might have had a painful moment.  Can you explain what happened, and is there anything lingering effect?  
PHIL MICKELSON: No, it feels fine now.  I kind of jarred it on the -- my right elbow, yeah.  It feels fine now.  Just jarred it out of the rough.  That happens with stuff that thick, but hopefully it just goes away, which it kind of did.   
 Q.  What's your reaction when you get out here and you haven't hit a shot and you're already staring up and seeing 7-under?  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's difficult, but you just have to stay in the present because if you start chasing a score like that, it won't come to you, and you'll end up making big mistakes.   
 Q.  What is it about this course that you always kind of seem to be in the mix at majors?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  It's a very fair -- I feel like I can make some pars out of the rough.  I feel like I don't have to be too perfect, but I feel like I can salvage a couple of pars with just a few bad tee shots, and if I keep it in check, I should be able to shoot an under-par round.   
 Q.  What's the funniest, most clever thing you heard out there today?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't recall.  I wasn't really paying too much attention.  But a lot of guys showing me their calves.  I don't know how I feel about that.  It's a little awkward.  But it was interesting.
