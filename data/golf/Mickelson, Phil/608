 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it was out there -- it's out there. The greens are receptive, the pins are in spots you can get to, and not much wind. So it was out there. 
 But I struggled with the blade again today and it was a frustrating week, really, putting. I love these greens, I usually putt them very well, but I struggled this week. 

 Q. What are you taking away from this at the end of the day?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I just, I just love playing here. I'm excited about playing golf and finishing the year right. I feel like my game has been coming around and I'm looking forward to getting back out and competing. 
 I'll have a few weeks off and we have got a couple family trips here lined up these next couple of weeks and then get back at it for Charlotte and the PLAYERS. And see if I can get some momentum too heading into the Majors. 

 Q. Coming into the 18 today did you think you might have some kind of a chance if you --
 PHIL MICKELSON: I never, I never feel like it, like you're out of it here. I felt like if I could shoot something in the low 60s, 63 or 64, you just never know what might happen. And as we're seeing, it's very hard to sleep on the lead, it's hard to come out and play aggressively when guys are chasing after you and you've got the lead. 
 We have seen guys do it over and over in history, throughout history at this tournament, guys want this thing so bad that sometimes it's hard to perform at the highest level. I felt like if I could get off a hot round or somebody 5-under or 6-under, just felt like that anybody had a chance. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't feel it. I really enjoyed the warm weather. I felt that it had the golf ball flying far and the back and body felt loose and limber and I felt really good, I just didn't put it together. 

 Q. Is wanting it worse here than it is at other places?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I think so. It is for me. It might be different for every player based on where they grew up or what their dreams were as a kid, but for me this is the one I wanted the most. 

 Q. We all talk a lot about the importance of short game and putting, but it seems like especially in your three wins you were never worse than third in greens in regulation. Does that get overlooked sometimes, even if you're just on the green, to be able to have some 2-putts and easy pars if there are any. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: You know, this course usually is all about angles. It's usually about putting the ball in the right spot so that you had a chance for an up-and-down. The greens were so soft, the pins were not tucked, that you could really miss it in spots you historically can't and still get up-and-down. 
 So I don't think, I didn't think greens in regulation were quite as important. I thought that you could get up-and-down from different spots and I thought you could be very aggressive this week. 
 It was great. I tried, I loved the way it was setup, but I didn't take advantage of it. 

 Q. Are you off until the PLAYERS? Is that the next one?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'll play Charlotte for sure. 

 Q. Are you going to take a couple weeks off, did you say?
 PHIL MICKELSON: We have a couple family trips lined up.
