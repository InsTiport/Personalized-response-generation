  PHIL MICKELSON:   I was able to stay focused for the most part over 72 holes, maybe 63 of them I did pretty well.   It was a good stepping-stone, and I would have liked to have been a little closer to the lead going into the final round, but it was a good tournament for me.  
   
 Q.   Coming out of here thinking of next week, where would you like to see improvement and what you experienced this week?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   A couple areas I'll focus in on.   I didn't strike the ball quite as solid the last two days.   Some areas of chipping I'll need to work on after the first two days, where the short game was really sharp.   It wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.   I'll see if I can fine-tune these next couple of days.  
   
 Q.   Phil, did you get what you wanted to out of these four days?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I wanted to come away with a victory but certainly more of an opportunity in today's final round.   I was in contention at the start of the weekend.   I felt good and got some momentum.   Good foundation on what to work on over the next three days to get sharp for Thursday.  
   
 Q.   What do you need to work on?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   My putting feels as good as it's been.   The ball striking the first couple days was really solid.   Hopefully didn't fall too far off, even though I didn't strike it the way I would like to the last couple of days.   My short irons distance control is really close to being sharp.   I need a slight adjustment.  
   
 Q.   How often have you finished your round with only one shoe on?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   That's rare, but unfortunately, it's not the first time it's happened.
