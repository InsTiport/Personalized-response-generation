 Q.  Talk about your round.  
PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't strike it maybe as well as I had been the first couple of rounds, but I was able to get a lot of it and get up-and-down and make a lot of pars.  It was a lot harder golf course with the firm greens.  It was hard to hit the greens.  It was a more challenging test.   
 Q.  No bogeys.  Impressive.  
PHIL MICKELSON: When I missed the green, I missed in the right spots.  I'll have Andrew come in and fine tune my swing for the final round, make sure the swing is on plane.  I didn't strike it as well as I have been.   
 Q.  Your thoughts about going for a fifth title here.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Sure, it would be nice.  I haven't thought about it.  It would mean a lot to play a good, solid round of golf, being in the last group.  I'd love to play a good, solid round.   
 Q.  Talk about the bunker shot on 3 that Nick Faldo suggested was a shank.  
PHIL MICKELSON: I didn't have a chance to hit the green.  I chipped it short and to the left.  I didn't want to go in the bunker, and if I had gone at the green, I would have been in the bunker.  So I just chipped it to the left and tried to get par.   
 Q.  Does it help being in the hunt twice this year at the Hope and in Phoenix?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think having been somewhat in contention in Palm Springs and last week in Phoenix will be very helpful for me heading into the final round.  I know I've been playing well.  Those events have given me some final round experience.   
 Q.  Talk about your experience playing with Iwata.  
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I don't think we have played together.
