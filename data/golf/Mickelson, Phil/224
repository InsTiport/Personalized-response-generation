A flash interview with:
PHIL MICKELSON
Q. Always a pleasure to get yourself in the last couple of groups here in Phoenix.  Can you still take some positives from this week?
PHIL MICKELSON: I played really well this week, and I will get a lot of momentum from this week.  I tried the front 9 to get to some of these pins, and I kept short-sighting myself and played the front 9 1-over and realized you just can't force it out here.  The golf course is not the way it used to be, where it's set up for birdies and to make a run, and I just played the back 9 patient, shot 1-under, and I had a good tournament.
Q. You talked earlier in the week about some of the swing changes and getting used to those.  Being in contention, how much does that help just an extra step forward?
PHIL MICKELSON: I don't understand.
Q. Well, I mean, you putting new changes in your golf swing.
PHIL MICKELSON: So, you know, striking ball very well.  I hit a lot of good shots.  I didn't shoot the number this week probably that I felt I could or should, but I feel like my game is right where I want it.  I will continue working on it.
I'm excited to go next week to AT&T and Pebble and play up there where I have had success.  I'm having more fun right now playing than I have had in years because I have control of the golf ball.  I feel like the game is starting to feel easy again.
I look forward to each shot and each event.  I can't wait to get to Pebble.
