 Q. Can you remember a day that was that tough under these conditions in?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, this is crazy, because when you get wind like this on greens that are 14-plus on the Stimpmeter it's hard to imagine that because you never see it at the local club. I don't see it -- maybe Augusta in the 90s. This was a case where we are trying to read the wind on the putts, and apparently we did a good job because Jimmy made a bunch of good, solid 4- or 5-footers today. It was really fun playing with him.

 Q. You struggled with the 4- or 5-footers; was the wind enough to affect a putt that short? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, it could definitely affect it. I hit a couple of good putts early on that didn't go in and kind of affected my confidence, and then I hit some bad ones there on. 

 Q. You came up with an interesting philosophy about this sort of match because you had not hit a green since the 10th; you've got to hit greens to make birdies, or just have birdie putts? 
 JIM FURYK: I definitely was a little loose with some iron shots today on the back nine, but it's easy to understand. I don't feel like I made a lot of bad swings. But the wind was very difficult. It was manipulating our ball and it was hard to use the wind out there. Made some good swings that didn't turn out well and like on 16, tried to get a little too cute and made some bad swings. Glad I had a partner and we ham-and-egged it pretty well today and came up with key shots when we had to.
