 Q.   Can you maybe just give us a little synopsis of where you think you're at right now?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's hard to say.   I played okay this week, and it's hard to say.   I'll take a couple weeks off and then come back and try to gear up for Augusta.   But for me to really have a good chance at Augusta, I've got to get in contention weeks prior.   
   
 Q.   Is it the putting that seems to be the problem?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   No.   I putted well.   I've been putting well the last couple weeks.  
   
 Q.   What was the problem this week?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I played pretty good actually.   I thought I played all right.   
   
 Q.   Is this the kind of golf course where it's hard to put numbers together with the weather and everything else?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a really tough course, you know, and I made a lot of things‑‑ like I had a good round going and I doubled 18.   Things like that have been happening, and I'm throwing away shots here or there that I just can't do if I want to get in contention.   But I feel like the game's fine, but the scoring isn't there yet.  
   
 Q.   Is that mental?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Probably.   Anyway.   
   
 Q.   Getting in contention, you sort of did last week, but is that not enough of a taste of it?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   No, I mean, I didn't play very good first round.   I was just fighting to get close.   I didn't really get in the thick of it.   You know, that's kind of the next step.   
   
 Q.   Tim Finchem said today that he probably whiffed it when he was notified about the changes to The Ryder Cup points system and didn't step up and say he should have taken a better look at how they handled the fall.   Your thoughts on that?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I think that we have been trying, kind of openly, with the last two years, on having like a wraparound schedule, and I'm not really a big fan of it.   I think that it's very hard for spectators to understand it.   I can't understand it.   And after playing eight out of ten or eight out of 11 weeks, you know, the guys are going to take time off.   And from The Ryder Cup standpoint, it doesn't make sense to have points assessed on those events when none of the top players are playing or very few, and maybe the FedExCup ought to start looking at that, as well, as maybe that's not the best place to start it out.   Maybe we should start it in January like we used to.  
   
 Q.   Do you realize that that might effectively, if that happened, effectively kill those events?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, The Ryder Cup isn't about accommodating everybody.   The Ryder Cup is trying to be competitive and get the best players in the field, and so when you're trying to identify the best, you can't really accommodate everybody, make everybody happy.   
   
 Q.   Are you playing both events in Texas prior to the Masters?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes.   I'll be there.   
   
 Q.   So you'll take the next two weeks off to get things lined up and then try to do it there?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Exactly.
