 Q.   Phil, 10 birdies, one off the course record, 62.   Your week is ending up a whole lot better than when it started.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, but you could really see it coming after that solid 71, 73 start.   
I don't know what to say.   It just kind of came out of nowhere.   I've been saying I'm close, I'm close, and then the first two rounds here threw me for a loop.   
What I've really been struggling with was my short irons, getting them close and making birdies.   Today it was right on.   It was right on distance control and spin and everything.   I made a lot of birdies.   It was nice.  
   
 Q.   I can't imagine how frustrating this year has been for you because, at various points, you've had certain parts of your game, I mean, just brilliant.   You drove it great one week, didn't putt.   Putted great one week, didn't hit your mid irons, whatever the case may be.   But now it looks like things may be starting to fall into place, and going into Valhalla next week, that's got to be a good sign.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It is, and Valhalla's a golf course you can make a lot of birdies at if you bring the ball in high and soft and get to those tough pins, there's some par 5s you can reach.   
I feel like the fairways are very generous there too.   I should be able to have a good week.   I had two good PGAs in '96 and 2000, and the '08 Ryder Cup was fun.   I love the golf course.   
Today was a big day for me, though, because it really gives me a lot of confidence and momentum heading into next week.   I feel like, instead of trying to search and find it on Thursday, I feel like it kind of clicked today, and if I can carry that momentum into the round, if I play well next week, I'll look back to Sunday's round, today's round, as being kind of the key.
