  Q. A gust of wind came up on your first shot of the week on 10. Any indication it was kind of a bad feeling from the start this week?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: No. I mean, that stuff happens. I thought the course was set up great. I thought that the soft conditions obviously made it a little bit easier than everybody had hoped. But the setup was wonderful. I thought it was a well-run event. The people came out and really supported the tournament, and I just didn't play how I had hoped.   
  
  Q. You've been around the golf course now and seen the Sunday setup. Talk about Rory's chances.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I think his chances are great now not because of the course setup or anything, just because of how he's playing. He's playing some terrific golf. He's hitting the ball well and rolling it well, so he's going to make some birdies today. There are birdie holes out there, and he's going to end up making some, so it'll make it even more difficult for guys to catch him.  
  
  Q. Considering what happened at Augusta, how impressive is it for him to come right back?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's pretty cool. You can tell that Rory has had this type of talent in him for some time now, and to see him putting it together is pretty neat to see.   
  
  Q. We're going to see a winning score, might be 17-, 18-under or something. Do you think this golf course is worthy of hosting the U.S. Open?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Oh, yeah, and I think the great thing about this tournament, the course and the setup, is that the best player this week is going to win.   
  
  Q. Earlier in the week you said that you think you've got a lot more chances to win majors. Does sort of a down week like this do anything to change your mind?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Not really. It just gets me more geared up to look forward to the British. We have some big tournaments, the British and the PGA, coming up as well as the FedExCup, so I'll have the next two weeks to try and get my game ready and head over to Europe.  
  
  Q. You started in the water at 18 and --  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, it's a tough hole. Those things happen. I was trying to carve a 5-iron into the green and just pulled it, didn't cut, and that bunker is not an easy spot to be today, and I hit a poor shot on top of it.   
  
  Q. What was missing this week, and what's going to be your takeaway?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm not sure yet if I have a great answer for you right now.  
  
  Q. Is it important for golf to have a dominant player?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know. I don't know. I think there's probably arguments both ways for that.
