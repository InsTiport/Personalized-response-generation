  Q. A rough start but you got some mojo working towards the end.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I had a rough round today in that the ball just didn't seem to want to go in the hole. I didn't feel bad with the putter. My speed was off a little bit early. I was a little tentative with my feet.   
 As I started to hit some good putts, they just weren't quite going in. Quite a difference from yesterday where they were all dropping, but it doesn't feel too different. It doesn't feel like I'm far off and it didn't feel dramatically different. When I looked up, the ball was online, which was important.  
  
  Q. Your impressions of your playing partner today; looks like he's pretty solid, one of the two Italian brother playing in the Masters, a big story in Europe.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, Edoardo hit the ball very well. He hits the ball solid, very penetrating flight through the wind. I thought he was very impressive on the greens. Really rolled the ball well and made some tough, tricky 5-, 6-footers to keep the ground going.   
 He won the U.S. Amateur, and I think that's a very challenging tournament to win where you have to play consistently over six rounds, and it shows that he's got a very solid, consistent game.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us why you always go out of your way to spend time with the fans and sign autographs after your rounds?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm appreciative of the fact that we are able to play golf for a living. I love what we are able to do, and it's because of the people that support us and support the game, and I'm appreciative.
