Q.  A lot of guys put some pretty good numbers up there today.  How come you didn't?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Great question.  Just didn't play well.  I'm just playing poorly, and I think I might just need a little break and try to get refreshed before the U.S. Open.
Q.  Next year this tournament is the week before THE PLAYERS Championship.  Sometimes it's a tricky spot to be in front of a big event.  Do you think this will be affected next year?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't think this tournament will be affected.  I think this is considered our favorite Tour event outside of the big ones and the majors.  I think it's going to make for a great stretch.  I think guys will come over.  We'll get overseas players who will want to come and play a two  or three week stretch and want to play in the Wachovia Championship.  I think it could be a benefit, but I don't see the field being detracted at all.
Q.  Are you just mentally tired?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I think so.  Just making a lot of poor mistakes.  The golf course is playing just perfect.  The greens are immaculate, and yet I can't make a putt.  No one to blame but myself.  The golf course couldn't be any better, the weather couldn't be any better, great setup, just not playing well.
