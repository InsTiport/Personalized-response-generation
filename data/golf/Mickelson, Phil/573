 Q. Pretty confident after this week?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was fun to get off to a good start, make some birdies. I knew that the course was going to be fairly difficult today because of the wind. But it didn't really enter my mind about winning until I was going to get to 12- or 13-under. That's kind of my number where I thought I could take a peek. But I never quite got there. 

 Q. Will you compare today's ball-striking round compared to yesterday?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was okay. It wasn't as good. It wasn't as good as yesterday. I hit it really well yesterday. I had a lot of tap-ins, which was great. But it was a good weekend for me because I had been struggling a little bit and played well on the weekend to get a little bit of confidence heading into this bye week. 

 Q. Do you think you'll continue with the belly putter?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I thought that the last couple of days especially, but throughout the whole week, from six feet on in, I felt very good with it. I made a lot of good ones. Because of that, I think I'm going to practice with it a little bit more from the 10- to 25-foot area where I need to make some of those, and I really didn't make one this week. If I can do that, if I can get effective with that, I think I'll try to stay with it. But I'd like to -- I think it had some merit, and I'm going to practice with it a little more and see if I can get a better feel, a better touch with it.

 Q. Is it trickier on the longer putts?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, there's no reason why it should not be every bit as good or better on lag putts, but because of the weight and because of my lack of practice with it on lag putting, I haven't had a chance to develop a touch with it.
