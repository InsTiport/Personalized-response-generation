 Q.   Comments about your first round?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   The golf course is just in great shape but the rough is very thick, and I missed a few too many fairways today, but had an okay start.   Even par isn't what I wanted but it was still a nice day on the golf course.   I can't get over what great shape the greens are in.   They are just spectacular.  
   
 Q.   Rough worse than Valhalla?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was very comparable.   It was actually much thicker, heavier and the grain was kind of going from the green to the tee, which makes it more difficult hitting into the grain than hitting down.   The ball just kind of buried in them.   But, the fairways are very fair.   They are fair width.   You should be able to hit them and it was only some poor swings that I made that missed them.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about what the mental approach is at an event like this where the points matter and even if maybe even par is‑‑ do you know what I'm saying‑‑ it's not about winning, it's about keeping yourself in contention.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I know that's what a lot of people may view it as.   I don't see it that way.   I think you're here to try to win a golf tournament and if you play well, you can't worry about points, you can't worry about what other guys are doing.   You just have to go out and shoot low scores and try to win the golf tournament.   If you do that and get in contention, you're going to keep moving forward and so forth.  
You just don't want to get off to too bad a start on Thursday.   I didn't play great.   I had a rough front nine and kept it at even par which is a good thing, because if I get it turned around and shoot a low one tomorrow, I can get right back in it.  
   
 Q.   Rory is a couple over par and you've been in that post‑major winning schedule, things get a little crazy.   Can you imagine what that's like?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I think after you win the British and the PGA I think it's going to be hard to get up mentally for any more golf.   That's made the year right there.   Anything after that is irrelevant I think, and I think it's difficult for him to get up.  
Now, he's such a good player, he'll end up coming back tomorrow would low round I anticipate.   But there's nothing he can do that is going to equal what he's already done this year.   
   
 Q.   Did you find that last year after the British a little?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   A little bit, yeah.
