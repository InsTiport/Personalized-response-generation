 Q.  I know you don't advance, but still good work this week with two wins.  Just comment on the week and the match today.  
PHIL MICKELSON: It feels good to come back and win these last two matches, even though I'm not advancing.  But it goes back to the first day.  You need to be ready to play from Day 1, because the opportunity to be eliminated is there.   
I played well today and made a lot of good birdies on the back nine.  Rafa and I had a good match.   
 Q.  The state of your game is good going into Houston and then the following week?  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think so.  I'm looking forward to getting there.  I'm going to go up and see Augusta before and spend a couple of days, as well.  And I'm looking forward to this next two weeks' stretch.  I would have liked to move on, though.
