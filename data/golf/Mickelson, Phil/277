 Q.   This is such an important event to you.   Why are you here again?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I enjoy the tournament.   I think the years that it's come about it's only been in the last decade really it went from no tournament to one of the better ones we have on Tour and Johnny Harris has really been great for the game of golf, great for this community and to bring Major championship here now, coming here's, it's exciting.   I'm excited to be here.   I love playing here.   I love what they've done to the golf course, softening some of the contouring.   The beauty of Quail Hollow is in its simplicity.   Tee to green one of the best layouts we have.   It's really one of our best courses we have.  
   
 Q.   After playing 18, where do you feel like your game is right now?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   We'll see tomorrow because I thought it was pretty good last week.   I thought I was ready to play and I played terrible.   I don't feel far off.   
I feel like my game feels pretty good.   We'll see.   This is a course I played well in the past and it's a course I like and feel comfortable on.   Also recovery shots are doable.   You can get away with a bad shot if you can -- hit a good recovery.   
Last week there are really few, very few recovery shots allowed and so any mistake I had was magnified.   I feel like I don't have to be perfect here to still score well.  
   
 Q.   Did you work on anything back home the last few days?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Not really other than just practicing, trying to get sharper.   I played pretty well the last few days.   Until you get in competition you just don't know exactly.  
   
 Q.   How much has this season tried your patience?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   No more than last season.   I feel like my game is really pretty sharp even though the scores haven't quite been there and I feel like it's close to turning around.   
I felt like Augusta was going to be a good jump start for the rest of the year and I'm hoping that it still is and that I'm able to play the way I did at Augusta here in Charlotte.  
   
 Q.   Phil, you've always played well here.   You're the leading money winner at this tournament yet you've never won the trophy.   How important would it be to win?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a course, again, that I feel like I should play well on.   The irony of the situation, I've actually won at Sawgrass last year -- last week's event which is just unbelievable.   
I haven't won here where I really have -- it's such a perfectly suited golf course for me that here at Quail Hollow that that's kind of the irony of the situation.   I'm looking to try to fix that.   I think that it's going to be a good week.   I do feel like I'm playing well enough to score low.  
   
 Q.   What did you make of Rickie's win?   You've been a good mentor to him and all these 20-somethings that are on the rise.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I think you saw from a lot of the professionals out here, a lot of support and happiness for his success because he's such a great guy.   You really like being around him.   He's a great player and really an asset to the PGA TOUR if he can play well and win.   
Last week's win at The Players is a big win for him and a big win for the Tour because he's able to kind of transcend just the game of golf and really reach out to a lot of young kids that are kind of on the fence about the game.   He has that ability to get outside of golf.   He just has that charisma and it's exciting that he's playing well.  
   
 Q.   You struggled last week a little bit.   Seems like you're enjoying yourself.   Do you find yourself enjoying it more as you get older?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I certainly play my best when I'm having fun.   I try to make that effort rather than to make it work where you're grinding all the time.   I enjoy playing golf for a living.   I think it's the greatest thing you could possibly do.  
It's certainly difficult in that it's a very, very intense kind of competitive environment where nothing is guaranteed.   You've got to come out and perform.   But I've always loved that challenge.  
   
 Q.   Phil, in a perfect world how would you like to prepare for the U.S. Open, do something to allow you guys access maybe months in advance?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   They're closing it down probably a month before, three weeks before.   I think that's plenty.   Gives the course a chance to get in tournament shape and be in good condition for the Open and gives us a chance to go play some practice rounds close enough to the Open where it will be some good as well as doing it in an environment without the public on the golf course.   I think that's fine.   They close it May 27th.   I'll plan on going there sometime after that.
