Q.   You played pretty solidly, a couple of missed shots you didn't get away with, but you hit lot of good ones and haven't converted. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes, but after a rough start today being 3‑over I played the last 13 in 6‑under, I played much better and I'm excited about how I was playing heading into this tournament, but I'm, I had a bit of a slap in the face with my first two scores. 
I'll try tomorrow to go out and play a good round, hopefully make the cut, but get a little bit of momentum heading into next week's event in San Diego.

Q.   Did you put the new driver in play today?   I thought you drove it a little better. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I did.   I had been driving this year Razr Fit driver, I got dialed in in the off season, but I felt like I didn't want to start the year with any changes in my bag.   And the first day, of course, I hit two out of bounds and I kind of bagged that idea. 
So this driver I hit much straighter and I ended up hitting it a lot better today.

Q.   It doesn't really matter in the scheme of things, you would love to play a great round of golf, but as the year goes its more or less just assessing everything. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It is and this has been a good week for me to identify some of the weaknesses.   I had a good conversation with Butch and also a good practice session after the round yesterday to try to work it out.   I think that having great weather on these golf courses with great practice facilities here in the Palm Springs area gives us a good foundation to start the year.   And so I'll go back this afternoon and practice for a couple hours and get dialed in and see if I can put it together for tomorrow's round and I'll carry that momentum into next week. 

Q.   It has to be really fun coming to a golf course that you had so much success on and the weather is perfect and that's what you mean by getting that opportunity to really figure out what's going on. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Exactly.   When you get into windy conditions and challenging conditions, it's more about just keeping the ball low and on the ground, you're not really able to work on things in your golf swing, work on hitting higher shots, and this perfect weather allows us to do that.
