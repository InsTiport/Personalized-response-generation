  PHIL MICKELSON:   I played really well today.   I needed a good, solid round.   I felt like I've been playing well.   I've been turning 66s into 71s like yesterday.   Today it was nice to shoot such a good score.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON:   This was a really good putt, one of the best putts of the day.   It doesn't -- you can't see from that angle.   The hole was downhill and extremely fast and broke a lot.   I played that two and a half feet, about two feet outside the hole and ended up making it.   It was a nice putt.  
   
 Q.   Go to 12.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   This putt is as straight as it can be.   If it was inch right or left you can maybe see from this angle just kind of work a little right and straightened up there.   
In the past that green worked a lot more towards the back and it would break a lot and it's like different putt this year than it has been in years past.  
   
 Q.   16, 17, 18.   How big was this for you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Nice way to finish the round.   Uphill, turned a few inches there at the end.   18 is a wonderful golf hole.   I just don't like playing it.   I -- it doesn't hit fit my eye.   I doubled it yesterday.   It's a very difficult hole for me.   Even though it's a great hole, just it's a hard one for me.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yes.   If you miss it in the right spot it's a lot like Augusta National where you have good -- the angle is more important than the distance from the hole.   If you play the golf course right there's half of the course you can play from and get up and down and salvage pars if you put it in the right spot.   Tee to green it's just spectacular.   It moves both ways amongst the trees.   It forces you to work the ball, create shots.   The greens have nice, soft movement working all different ways.  
Of course, you need to hit it in the right spots into the green to get the ball close.   That's why it's such a great challenge, great golf course.   You don't have to overdo it.   The greens were so severely pitched that it took away from its charm in the past.   Now that they've softened it on the greens, it really brings out its greatness.  
   
 Q.   How is your position?   You had a great round of golf today.  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I'm excited about the weekend.   I'm excited that I finally put together a good round.   Excited that I'm hitting the ball well and putting well.   So, I don't want to get ahead of myself.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow's round.  
   
 Q.   Once again, Phil Mickelson, headed into the weekend in contention.   You said yesterday you turned a 66 into a 71.   Today you posted a 66.   Was your play today reflective of that number?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I feel like it is.   I hit a lot of good shots.   I made some good putts today and was able to salvage par on difficult holes.   Right now nobody is turning 66s into 71s better than me and it's nice to finally shoot that 66 and get the score that reflects the way I feel I'm playing.  
   
 Q.   You talked earlier in the week about this golf course that you love, that you don't play fantastic.   How does this golf course with your ability allow you to make that statement?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Half the golf course is playable.   If you miss it in the right spot you can play it and still have a chance to salvage a par.   That's what I really enjoy about it.   If you go into the rough, if you're in the rough you have a shot underneath the trees, around the trees to get up by the green, in front of the green, still salvage par.   
I don't have to play perfect.   I feel like I can recover so long as I miss it in the correct spot.  
   
 Q.   Last year you shot 63 in this Championship.   Do you feel like there's a number there for you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   This was a pretty low number so it's going to be hard to get much lower as the greens start to firm up and get quicker.   However, you never know.   There's a lot of birdie holes out there but you got to birdie the ones that you're supposed to and get through the tough ones.
