 Q.   Talk about the round out there.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   The course is in great shape and had a good round going there for a while, just the last three holes were sick.   But it was a good day.   I was playing well, but the last three holes just threw away a good round.  
   
 Q.   Was there anything in particular that changed in those three holes?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know.   I just made a couple of doubles.   And the 16th hole is a hard hole for me.   It's just not a good hole for me.   I go in the water there a lot.   And I thought making a 4 was pretty good.   I'll take a 4 all four days on that hole.   
I didn't think it was a big deal, but 17 threw me for a loop.   Just made double.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like maybe you kept the momentum going when you made that hard 13?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I let a really good, hot round go with not birdieing 11, missing a good birdie putt on 12, not birdieing 14 from seven feet.   I let some good birdie opportunities go.   But I birdied 15 and thought if I could finish this round strong shooting in the 60s, and I was looking at‑‑ I was trying to get one more coming in, but, boy, threw away 5.   So I've got some work to do tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What is it about 16 that doesn't look good to you?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, it's opposite of my shot dispersion.   So if I miss it at all left, it's going to go shorter and not carry and go in the water.   If I pull it, it just goes hot up that hillside on the downslope and then I've water again.   
It's a feast or famine hole for me.   It doesn't set up well for a left‑handed shot dispersion.   It has to be a perfectly struck shot.   And I just go in the water there most of the time, because I don't want to pull it way to the right.   
   
 Q.   Is that one where you've ever thought about purposely missing the green in a good spot or is there a good spot for you to miss it?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't know where to do that.   It's just a hard hole for me.   It's not a big deal.   You've got to play it.   But that's a hole where I'm going to play it 3 or 4 over for the week.   Where I gave it back is on 17 and 18 because those aren't‑‑ I shouldn't make double on those.  
   
 Q.   Just the wrong club on 17 or did you just‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Gosh, the wind changed.   I was looking at‑‑ it was only 161.   It was downwind.   Got 9‑iron and it's too much, it might go over.   And by the time I hit it, when it was my turn to hit, the wind came straight back in my face.   I had to go to an 8‑iron.   And then I came up way short, and just a bit of a wind change through there.   But still I didn't have that hard of an up‑and‑down.   Uphill lie.   Should have been able to flip one up on the green, have a good run at par.   But instead I fluff it, make 6.  
   
 Q.   What can a kid like Jordan learn from you?   Seems a strange question after those last three‑‑  
PHIL MICKELSON:   Not much today.
