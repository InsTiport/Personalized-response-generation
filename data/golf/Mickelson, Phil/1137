Q.
Talk about your round today under difficult conditions.
PHIL MICKELSON:  It was a tough day to play well and shoot low, because the greens were so tough.

What a great round Padraig Harrington had, and Adam Scott played exceptional.  What a great exciting finish this tournament was.
Q.  Some of the gentlemen have compared the greens here to what you're going to see at Augusta National.  Do you feel the same way?
PHIL MICKELSON:  The greens as far as the firmness and speed are very similar to what we'll see at Augusta.  Augusta greens are going to be bigger, a little larger undulations, but the firmness and speeds are going to be the same.
Q.  What are your preparations going heading into Augusta?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'll be playing next week in Atlanta, and the course setup is very similar at TPC Sugarloaf as it is at Augusta.
Q.  This close today, a couple of your putts were short?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I played well, I shot 1-under par on a tough golf course, but I didn't take advantage of a few opportunities I had to get it going.

I needed to have a good back nine, and I ended up missing a six-footer on 11 that was a tough putt.  I hit it a little too hard, and didn't birdie on 12.  And those were the holes you had to birdie because the pins coming in were tough to get to, with the exception of 16.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  13 I made an unusual bogey, I hit it in the water, and hit the next one pretty good, a tap-in bogey.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  I think the big thing for me this week was playing four solid rounds of under par and minimizing my mistakes, only making bogey, not having any doubles.  That certainly helped me get in contention and tie for third.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  I'm pretty pleased with how I played over the four days, and I think Atlanta will be a test for me to get ready for Augusta.
