 Q.  Talk about your round today. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  A tough day.  One of the most difficult.  I've seen some difficult ones in the past.  Only one person under par. 

 Q.  The conditions. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  Tough as I've seen.  It wasn't as hard as it could have been because they put water on the greens.  Think it's not impossible.  I will try to gather a game plan tonight.  It's tough to be aggressive at all with these conditions.  You have to be patient.  It was a fair challenge. 

 As tough as it is, I didn't think it was unfair by any means.  It's a challenge to make pars.  You have to fight on every hole to make par here. 

 I don't feel like it's unrealistic, I've seen people come from seven shots back.  It was a very good round for me.  I played pretty well and fought hard to make a lot of pars.  Obviously I needed to shoot under par to really put myself in contention.  I fought hard enough to where at least I have a chance.  I was looking at the leaderboard to get a game plan and what I have to do tomorrow.  Only two people are under par.  Tomorrow, I feel like I have to shoot in the 60s to have a chance.  I think I have to make 14 pars and four birdies.  That's kind of the game plan. 

 There are four birdie holes, but you are limited on those birdie chances.  Certainly I need to get closer to even, but over par will win the tournament. 

 Q.  Game plan tomorrow. 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  It will be the same, but to execute better and I have to make more birdies on the par-5s.  Had good chances on 8, 13 and 15.  Didn't capitalize on those. 

 Q.  No square driver? 

 PHIL MICKELSON:  With it be being windy, I hit the other driver to hit low shots.  I used it exclusively today. 

 Historically in this tournament the winner has come from the final pairing for however many years. 

 There's a good chance that somebody that goes off early and posts a good number can possibly take the title this year.
