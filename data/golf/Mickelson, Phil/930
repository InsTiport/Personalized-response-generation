 Q. Welcome to the British summer! 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  This is great! This is really rare because it has been rare here but we can deal with it for a day - I am sure it will be nice this weekend. 

 Q. One off the lead after a 68, you must fancy your chances? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I am looking forward to the weekend and having a chance to win, it's going to be a lot of fun. I didn't feel all that great on the course today, I was fighting it a little bit. Fighting it on the tee and fighting it with the putter but I was able to get away with a couple of bad shots that stayed in play and allowed me to keep going with a few pars and then made a couple of birdies coming in. I was very fortunate to have shot a couple under today, even though there was low scores out there because there wasn't any wind - the players could shoot some low scores - but I wasn't really able to take advantage of it today because I wasn't hitting it where I wanted to. 

 Q. And you said yesterday how pleased you were with the driver - it's almost like a curse, isn't it? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I know. Did you curse me?! No, that's the way the game of golf goes. You think you have it dialed in - I mean I still hit a number of fairways and my misses where somewhat controlled but there were a few shots in the back nine where I let in slide and I got away with it. 

 Q. And a great birdie on the last to finish? 
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah and hopefully we can get it turned around for the weekend and get in with a chance.
