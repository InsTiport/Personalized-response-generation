PHIL MICKELSON:  I don't play well playing conservative. And there were a number of low pins today, meaning the pins were in low spots and you could get to them.  I felt today was the day to go low.  Tomorrow they're going to be high spots, and it's going to be difficult to make birdies.  I made three bogeys, I'm not overly disappointed with that.  I'm going to make some bogeys on this golf course, you just can't hit every fairway and every green here. Nobody is in fallible.  I made a number of birdies to offset that. I shot 2-under par on a Saturday which is difficult at the U.S. Open, and I, by no means, am disappointed.
