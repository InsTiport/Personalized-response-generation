 Q. Your thoughts, not bad, not good, where was that round?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I got off to a good start, but I shot 3-under, I didn't hurt myself any, but I didn't -- I had an opportunity to shoot a really good round and just didn't do it. So I'll need to come out tomorrow and shoot something in the mid 60s and get myself right back in it.

 Q. Thoughts on the course, you've played the last couple of years?
 PHIL MICKELSON: The course is in great shape. It's really a wonderful track. It's in great stand and there's some birdies to be had. 

 Q. Enthusiastic supporters as always?
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's been fun, yes.
