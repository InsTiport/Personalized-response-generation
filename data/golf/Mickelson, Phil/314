 Q.  Obviously a fun match for you guys tomorrow?  PHIL MICKELSON: It's going to be a difficult match against what we perceive as the strongest team that Europe has and I know what a great player Rory McIlroy is and I've played with Sergio for a number of years and know what a great player he is. We have our work cut out for us, but we're on top of our games as well, and hopefully we'll have a good match.   Q.  In terms of having a couple of weeks off and having three days of practice so far this week, what kind of things have you worked particularly?  PHIL MICKELSON: We're all just trying to pace ourselves with all the practise rounds and make sure that we peak and get our game ready for tomorrow
