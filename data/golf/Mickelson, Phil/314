Q.   What happened on the shot from the grandstand?
PHIL MICKELSON:   I hit a crappy drive, hit the cart path and went into the grandstands and my drop was going to be in hay.   I had a clear lie on nice ground there and played it.   I hit it a little too hard, went over the green, hit a bunker shot to 20 feet and made bogey. 

Q.   Is that a first from the grandstand? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   No.   If you hit it off‑line enough, you're going to see those spots.   Just hit the shot a little bit too far.   I hit it clean.   Just hit it too hard.

Q.   The difficulty of that shot‑‑ even for you? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It wasn't hard to make contact.   It was hard to hit it on that skinny little green and get it to stop.   That was it.   Just a bad tee shot.   It's a great hole.   It's the only hole you can reach it under regulation here.   The par 5s are not reachable.   So you get really excited to get to that hole.   I hit it great yesterday on the green.   Had a great chance for eagle and then today hit a terrible shot. 

Q.   Do you sort of relish hitting a shot like that? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   I don't mind it.   Yeah, I don't mind it.   It's fun. 

Q.   Easier than the cart path shot? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Same.   Similar, yeah.   Doesn't scrap up your club as much. 

Q.   You're right on the number right now?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   Was that a 7‑footer on the last? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   About.   So I've got to get some rest because I've got an early tee time; or, maybe not, depends.   It's right on the edge of maybe or maybe not.
