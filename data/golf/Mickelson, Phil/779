   PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know what it was; I wasn't quite into the round. I had a couple of mistakes and didn't take advantage of birdie holes. Like #1, the pin is in a birdie spot and I hit it in the trees and was fighting for par. If you hit it off the tee to a reasonable spot you are going to have a little wedge to a pin that the ball funnels to. I just didn't take advantage of the birdie holes. But I'll take 1 under. I feel like I'm in it for the weekend and I feel like I've been playing well. So, I'm looking forward to it.  
 There are some pins that are very challenging that are on slopes. That 10th hole, I hit a decent putt and it rolled 12 or 15 feet by. So, 17 was not a surprise to me. They are not bad pins. They are great pins, they are just challenging.  
 I'll have to spend a little time this afternoon on the greens to get my lag putting down. I think that's going to be a key here with these greens as fast as they are shaping up to be for the weekend. Having 40, 50 or 60-foot putts is going to be common because it's going to hard to get the ball close on some of the pins. You are going to have a lot of 5 and 6-footers. But those putts are very makeable because the greens are perfect. There are no bumps and they are tracking beautifully. If you hit a good putt, you are going to make it.  
 My round was a bit more exciting than I wanted it to be. But the course is playing awesome. It's not easy, with the wind and the greens being so firm. I had a couple of mistakes out there, but the greens are very difficult to putt. A lot of guys played well though, but I struggled in judging some of the wind and my speed on the greens.
