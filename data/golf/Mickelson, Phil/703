   PHIL MICKELSON: I feel like I can miss shots and still recover. I know the greens, and so I have confidence in the reads and how they're going to break. Even though they're tricky, I've played them now for so many years that I have a pretty good idea of exactly what it's going to do, and it relaxes me when I go down Magnolia Lane.

 Q. You haven't played your best this year obviously. Are you tinkering around or are you struggling a little bit?
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, I haven't been tinkering too much, it just hasn't quite clicked. Like I've been saying for a while, it doesn't feel far off, but I've been either driving it great or the putter hasn't been quite there, but the putter feels terrific right now. All the putts that didn't go in were catching lips, and to me that's a sign that I'm tracking the ball on-line and giving it a good roll. I made a couple out there today, I made a lot of short ones, as well, so the putter and the short game feels really good. Given that I drove the ball well and the fairways are a little more open here, I can free it up. I feel pretty comfortable on this course.
