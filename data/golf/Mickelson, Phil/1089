Q.
Talk a little bit about your match.
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, Angel is a very tough competitor, and he didn't play his best today.  I was fortunate to get him on an off day and was able to get a couple of birdies early in the match to build a lead and played a little more conservative on the back.
Q.  Both Tiger and Vijay    Tiger looks like he may lose and Vijay goes down.  Anything happens in match play; is that how it works?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, regarding match play, I look at my wins at Phoenix Open and AT&T, and I would have been knocked out first round 50 percent of the time at Phoenix, never even had a chance to shoot 60.  And at AT&T I would have been knocked out the last round.

So you just don't have those four rounds to make up the difference.  It's such a coin toss as far as who is going to win.
Q.  You seem to have it going really well.  Are you ready to get right back out on the course and do it again?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's fun to be able to keep playing and to win some matches.  I love this tournament and love match play.  To keep going is fine.
