 Q.   How would you best describe the way it was out there for you today?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was a day that I thought you could get‑‑ you could get under.   And the fact that I was 2‑over early, I had to be really patient not to force the issue and fight for a lot of pars out there.   And take advantage of a few birdie opportunities.   
I thought that I played better again than the score dictated, but this is a really fun challenge.   It is a hard challenge, but it is a lot of fun.   Every shot requires such great focus because the penalty can come up and bite you so quickly here.   It's just a very penalizing golf course.   But there are birdie holes out here.  
   
 Q.   You have the lead.   You're the only man under par.   18 holes to go to win a U.S. Open.   What do you think it's going to be like for you tomorrow with Hunter in the final group?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   A lot of fun.   Let's go.   I can't wait to get back out playing.   I feel really good ball striking, I feel good on the greens, and I think that it's going take an under par round tomorrow.
