   PHIL MICKELSON:  It was pretty cold and windy this morning but it's actually pretty nice, the back nine.  I don't know the temperature gauge.   
  
  Q.  Do you have an opinion on the grooves issue?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I do, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Would you like to give it?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No.   
  
  Q.  And have you thought about playing with a square driver?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yeah, I'll be doing that at Augusta for sure, and I may put it in the bag in a couple of rounds next week.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I've been working on it for a while.  It's ready.  I just haven't had the right course to put it in play yet.   
  
  Q.  Does it feel different than the other club?  I talked to a couple of people and they say it feels a little different.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It goes a lot straighter, a lot straighter with that club, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Can you just generalize how you played today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I shot 2-over.  I don't really know where to go with that.  You know, I just  --  I'm not getting putts to go in, and that seems to be what's giving me the biggest problem right now.   
  
  Q.  Mentioned it was cold and windy when it teed off, how do you think course conditions factored into the early round?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It made it challenging the front nine.  I played a pretty good front nine at 1-under and when it got nice, I played poorly on the back.  I don't know, the temperatures and the wind got much easier the back nine.  I just didn't play as well.   
  
  Q.  You haven't been here for a couple of years.  Score aside, are you enjoying being back here?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I like it here, yeah.  I've always liked the tournament.  It's just been tough scheduling the last few years.   
  
  Q.  Your opinion, is the course playing tougher today rather than on Thursday and Friday?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Yes, it was a lot tougher.   
  
  Q.  Are you looking any further than the Masters in terms of schedule?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  No.  I'm just working on up to the Masters, yeah.   
  
  Q.  You said it's playing tougher today; in what way?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it was windier and the air was cooler, so the ball gets affected by the wind much more and the greens were a little faster.  It's just harder.
