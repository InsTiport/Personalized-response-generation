  Q. Talk about Robert Karlsson on the back nine.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: He was good. He's a darned good player. I haven't seen much of him, but he's really good. It was a great match.   
  
  Q. Have you ever felt any more pressure than you felt on the last putt?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: I don't know, there's so much going on. You want to make it so bad and then you don't want to force it. I don't know, I just tried to hit a good putt, I just didn't hit it quite firm enough. But I got the 4 and made them at least get a 4.  
  
  Q. Phil, you had a putt to take a 1-up lead going into 17. A misread there?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I kept reading more and more break as I got over it. I didn't want to jam it in, and I just overplayed the break. It wasn't that hard, but it was about four or five inches, about three or four inches out, and I overplayed it just a touch. But I thought we hung tough. Robert Karlsson made six birdies on the back nine, so we withstood that for a halve; I think that's a good sign of the way we kind of clutched up at times.   
 It was a good birdie on 15, good birdie on 18, kept us right in there. I was fortunate to get a couple, and I thought we played very well as a team, and we're looking forward to singles tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Phil, it's been a long day, but what a match.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was a great match. Hunter and I played some good golf. We hung tough. Karlsson birdied six holes on the back nine, made it very difficult, and we were able to kind of with stand that and hang in there. I think when you get a half point against somebody playing that well, you're very fortunate. So we're looking forward to singles tomorrow.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: I was expecting that. Those two guys were playing good, and we knew that. It was tough. I mean, they played great coming down the stretch there. Luckily we kept making them with the last few holes to go. Phil was huge today.   
  
  Q. That was just so much fun to watch. You were focused on your own match, but you could feel it out there, it was just a special day.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was a very emotional and up-and-down day. Hunter and I played some good golf, and we were able to withstand Robert Karlsson birdieing six of the last nine holes. I mean, he just played some great golf, and we were fortunate that we were able to make enough birdies to halve the match.   
  
  Q. Starting this morning you guys had that big lead alongside Anthony. I'm sure that one when you look back, that one hurts a little bit?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: It certainly does. When we were 4-up we had some momentum, we were going, and unfortunately a couple bad shots by us, and we ended up squandering a lead.   
 We still fought hard. It looked like we were going to bring that thing down to the end until that long putt on 17 by Oliver Wilson that sealed it.   
 But we fought hard all day, and Hunter and I hung in there, and obviously we wanted to win, we had opportunities for that. But as well as Karlsson played, as many birdies as he made, a half point isn't bad. We walked out of the afternoon, I believe, tied 2-2, so they threw some good golf at us today, we still have a lead, we're looking forward to tomorrow's singles.  
  
  Q. Just give us an idea as to how intense it is, what kind of pressure you guys are under?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, it's a well challenge, it's a fun obstacle. It feels like five rounds as final rounds of a major. There's one round of golf for each match, and it's just like a Sunday at a major, yet you have five of those all capped into three days.  
  
  Q. But these crowds are even probably louder than what you get at a major, aren't they?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes. Yes, they are.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like even the noose is tightening? Every shot they were crawling closer and closer.   
 PHIL MICKELSON: No, not like that. They played some good golf, but they only got one point from us today, and we're looking forward to singles.
