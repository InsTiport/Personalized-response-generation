   PHIL MICKELSON: There's a big event, a major championship or THE PLAYERS once every month, so it gives us a good stretch for five months and reason to work hard on our game and keep it sharp. I'm excited about this week. Wells Fargo and Quail Hollow have been wonderful sites, one of the best tournaments if not the best event outside of the majors that we have, and I enjoy playing here every year.   
  
  Q. What were the problems with the greens here last year? It did come out that you didn't like some of the shape of the greens. Did you get that settled?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I was frustrated when I wasn't able to go at the pin for the third time in the round after hitting a green. I shouldn't have said anything, but I was frustrated.   
  
  Q. Are you okay with them now?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I mean, they know for the major that there will have to be modifications. These greens were designed to roll about 9 on the stimpmeter and they're rolling 13, 14. But for the PGA they'll be fine.  
  
  Q. Do you like the way it's set up?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I do. I think it's just terrific the way the golf course is set up. It's perfectly manicured. I love the first cut. It's very much like Augusta, and there's so many trees here, it really is exciting because it gives you an opportunity to try a recovery shot. There's a lot of penalties with as many trees as are here, that they have here, but I think it is the most exciting shot in golf, and it gives you an opportunity given the first cut to do that.  
  
  Q. You can reach the trees then?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, always, always reach.
