 Q. Thoughts on the day? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was a good round today. I played well to shoot 6-under. I had a couple of chip-ins, which was nice and kept the ball in play all throughout the day, and then made a couple of birdies at the end. 

 Q. Where did you chip in?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I chipped in on No. 7, and I chipped in on 15, for those two birdies, and birdied 16 and 18, as well, coming in. 

 Q. What did you do on 16? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hit a hybrid into the right bunker, the fairway bunker, and I hit one of the best shots I hit all day was a pitching wedge out of that bunker to 12 feet. It stayed on the upslope and was kind of half-submerged and I ended up hitting a really good shot to make birdie there. 

 Q. Last time you finished in third place in the HSBC; do you hope to do better?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I hope so. I like this tournament a lot and I like this golf course a lot and I've played well here in the past. So I'm hoping to play well on the weekend, but I'm very pleased with where I have put myself after two rounds. 

 Q. And you are designing a golf course here in China?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm designing two projects, one project in Tian Jin called the World, is an amazing project, where many different cities of the world are being built on this project. And I designed the golf course with Joe Obringer and Rick Smith, 18 holes throughout the world. They are not copies of holes, but they belong on 18 different golf courses. And that was very exciting for me to do and challenging.
 I'm doing a course with the same developer in Kunming, and the project in Kunming will have three golf courses but what's unique about this project is one of the courses is a par 3 course, and we are hoping to get many children and families out on the par 3 course to learn the game of golf. 

 Q. Did you get a chance to go and see them?
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes, I was there a week and a half ago. 

 Q. Could you talk about the enthusiasm of the Chinese fans here, because there's a unique atmosphere to this tournament, isn't there?
 PHIL MICKELSON: There is, and it's exciting to see that so many people are starting to understand the game of golf and get excited about the game of golf. It's really gained in popularity. This is my third year here, and I've seen a great increase in the number of people that have come out to watch, as well as the excitement level. 
 Obviously Tiger Woods coming here plays a big part of that, but he also came here three or four years ago, and this is at a whole different level this year. It's been neat to see.  
 Q. And you're excited with the move you've made today, as well?
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm pleased with where I put myself after two rounds. I put myself in a good position heading in the weekend. There's a lot of guys there and I'll need to play very well on the weekend, but I'm in good position.
