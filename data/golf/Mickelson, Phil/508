Q.   First of all, great birthday serenade on 18.   Is it fun to hear that?
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, it's a long, difficult day, even though it's my birthday.   And it was very flattering of the fans, thank you. 

Q.   As far as the course setup today, how did you feel the course was set up today?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was fine. 

Q.   Compared to the last couple of days, do they play about the same, any differences you played the first couple of days, either the way you played or the way you felt it was prepared?
PHIL MICKELSON:   It was similar to what was expected, I think.
