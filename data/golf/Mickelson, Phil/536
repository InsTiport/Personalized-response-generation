 Q.   What kind of conditions do you want for Sunday?  
PHIL MICKELSON:   This was a really fun day, and it gave me‑‑ it gives me an opportunity to make something special happen tomorrow.   As great and as fun a round as this was, it just makes it possible to have something really special tomorrow.   I still have to go out tomorrow and do it.   I still have to play some great golf on a tough golf course with some tough pin placements.   
But having that opportunity to be in the final group here at the Masters on Sunday, it's the greatest feeling in professional golf.   
   
 Q.   Did you imagine you had a back nine like that coming?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I think as I look back on this tournament I go back to Thursday because I felt like at some point I would get hot, kind of like the back nine today.   But instead of being just enough to make the cut, I wanted it to be something where it could move me up the leaderboard, so I had to really fight on Thursday when I was letting the round slip away, 4‑over through 10.   Getting a couple of shots back on Thursday evening is what put me in a position to shoot a low round and move up the leaderboard, and I think I'll go back to Thursday and the way I fought hard those last eight holes to stay in it as being the critical eight holes to give me a chance on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Peter Hanson said that a one‑shot lead over you going into Sunday isn't that much of a lead.   What have you seen from his play in the last couple days?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, he's playing great golf.   I played with him the first two days.   He's a really nice guy and a wonderful player, and I saw today firsthand from the group behind him just how good he can play because he was hitting shots right on the pin and he was making a lot of putts, and I had to make something happen just to hang close to him.
