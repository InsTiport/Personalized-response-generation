PHIL MICKELSON: You know, it's just one of those things where if it starts going bad in these conditions, it's just going to go bad.  It's not that big a deal.  Unfortunately it's the first cut I've missed this year and I missed it with flair.  I was surprised because I really thought -- I thought Thursday I was prepared.  I felt like I was ready.  I thought I had a good game plan.  I thought my game was sharp.  But obviously it wasn't.  I've got this week off and I'll see if I can get it sharp for Akron and the PGA.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: What Tim did was kept it fun.  And we made the best of it.  We all go through days like this.  And it's part of the game.  I don't want to put too much stock in it, because I've really been hitting the ball well and playing well.  So rather than dwell on two rough days here, I'll go back home and get ready for these upcoming events.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: I think that -- yeah, I think that was a big factor for me.  I didn't adjust quickly to how far the ball was going.  I didn't adjust to the ground, how far the ball was running.  The shorter pins are deceptive to your eye.  They look further away and they take some getting used to.  And I think playing a week before at the Scottish is very helpful, and it may have made a difference.  It's hard to say.  But this further proves that when I don't play the week before a major, I oftentimes am not as sharp and ready to play as I need to be.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: It just takes a little while to get used to.  When you play a few rounds competitively in tournament conditions, like the Scottish Open provides, it gets you ready.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PHIL MICKELSON: I haven't noticed it.  What's unusual about Birkdale is it doesn't go out and come back, so you have a lot of movement throughout the round.  And so you tend to get all different kinds of winds, unlike some of the links courses that we play.  So it's unique in that regard.
