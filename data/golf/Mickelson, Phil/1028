Q.
Was it what you expected?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It's very fair and it's what I expected.  There's going to be some low rounds out there because it's just a very fair setup.  I had a chance to go low and didn't quite do it, but there's three more days, so we'll see.
Q.  What happened on the par 5s?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I knocked two balls in hazards on 3 and 15 and ended up making bogey.  I was fortunate enough to birdie the other two.
Q.  Will 18 be a challenging hole today?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, if you're smart enough to play a little right of that pin, you'll have a nice birdie putt.  But there aren't too many idiots like myself who go at the pin and hit that slope and kick down.  It was a stupid play.  I had a little sand wedge in and I should have had a nice eight foot birdie putt, but I made a mistake.
Q.  Vijay played right in front of you.
PHIL MICKELSON:  He made birdie, though, so it's okay.
Q.  Did you feel like you were grinding today a little bit?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Maybe.  You know, the front side is kind of a tale of two different nines.  I didn't hit a fairway on the front nine and I struggled and shot 1 over, and on the back side I hit every fairway but one and shot 3 under.  I started to drive it a little bit better, and that's what I need to do if I'm going to play well here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  There shouldn't be, but it might take a round or two.  I kind of let the last couple weeks slide by without really getting it going, even though I've had a couple of chances.  I'd like to try to put it together tomorrow for the weekend because I love playing the weekend in contention here.  It's just a really fun thing to do.
Q.  I know it's only day one, but are the galleries out in full force?
PHIL MICKELSON:  I just think that this tournament get more supports than any other tournament out there.  As a player, it's a very special, very unique feel to be out here.  We really enjoy it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, it was great.  We started off so early, it wasn't too crowded.  But the back nine we had a terrific following.  The people here have been terrific.  They've really treated us well.
Q.  Does this course have a special memory for you?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I know that I've had a 60 on it.  I think that there are some low rounds.  We'll see guys shoot a 9 or 10 under par round.  I see that happening this week at a place like this.  Again, it's a very fair setup, but if you miss a few shots, you're going to make some bogeys.
