  Q. How would you rate your round today?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I'm disappointed in myself because I let a good round slide. I let a good opportunity to get back into the tournament somewhat to where a good round tomorrow could maybe get it done, and I let it go and I'm disappointed in myself.  
  
  Q. Especially 16 and 17?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Yes. Going out, I missed two or three opportunities that I probably should have made on the greens, but coming in, I made everything. I putted great, and then I made those bad 5-iron swings on 16 and 17 and played those holes in 3-over, and it was just -- I'm frustrated with myself, because again, if I could have picked one up, finished 5 or 6, you just never know what'll happen tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Strategic decisions at those points hurt you?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: I don't know strategically if 5-iron off the tee and hooking it out of bounds was the issue. It was just a bad swing. I was trying to hit a low hook, and I hit it a little too quick. I'm frustrated, but today to me was just a great day on St. Andrews, because the wind was challenging but fair. The pins were challenging but fair. And there was some good scoring out there. There were some birdies out there, and also there's some bogeys. I thought that this was a fun day to play this championship under these conditions.   
  
  Q. Did you feel it when you got to 4?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: I felt like teeing off I was hitting the ball well. I started to drive it really well. I drove it great today all day until that one on 16. But with the driver I hit it very well. And so I was able to play the course aggressively, and I thought that it was going to be a good day. I gave myself great opportunities there on the front nine, let a few slide, but then I started making them coming in.  
  
  Q. How about some of the positive thoughts you can take into tomorrow?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, you never know what's going to happen out here. You never know what the weather is going to do. I'm going to get off quite a bit before the leaders, and you go out and shoot 7-, 8-, 9-under par, do what Rory did, you just never know. You never want to count yourself out because you don't know what the conditions will be.  
  
  Q. Could you imagine what Louis may have been feeling this morning and do you remember when you were in that position for the first time?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's a pretty good feeling. That's what we all want is a five-shot lead no matter where it is in the tournament, preferably towards the end. It is nerve wracking because you're teeing off at 4:00 and you've got the whole day to think about it. You don't normally go out at home and play at 4:00. That's not your normal tee time. It's 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, late afternoon is 1:00 or 2:00. It's awkward to adjust to that. I remember that at Augusta where 3:00 is the tee time, and it takes a little bit of time.  
 I've played with Louis. He is a good ball striker. He can really play. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if he were to play a good solid week and win.  
  
  Q. Are you good of within the next couple hours saying, okay, let's move on to the next thing?  
 PHIL MICKELSON: Well, I'm frustrated with myself, not only today's round, the first couple. I love this tournament, and just am disappointed in myself for the way I've performed this week.
