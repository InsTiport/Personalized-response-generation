  Q.  Done for the night, but a good way to finish on the last hole.  Talk about how you feel going into tomorrow.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, I've got four good holes coming in here that you can make some birdies, but there's good risk-reward here, and I think if I can get a couple -- two birdies coming in, I should be in good position for the last two rounds.   
  
  Q.  How did you feel today out there?  It seemed like you were kind of struggling to get it going a little bit and then you had a little hiccup there on 9 and then maybe came back.   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  I felt like I had been hitting the ball well, driving it well and hitting some good iron shots.  What I haven't felt comfortable with was the putter.  I didn't feel comfortable last week but I was able to make some.  I've been able to make some here but I haven't felt comfortable, and I've blocked some putts.   
 Maybe I'll think about it tonight and give it a little time to think about it and come out tomorrow and maybe turn it around.   
  
  Q.  You've played well here in the past.  Is it nice knowing that you can go low here on the weekend and probably stay in contention?   
 PHIL MICKELSON:  It is, and it's nice being, again, with it only four shots, getting those last two birdies was nice because of the way I gave it away on 9.  But if I can just get a couple birdies coming in here, I should be in good position for the final two rounds, which is a goal.
