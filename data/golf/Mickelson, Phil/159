Q. Looked like a pretty clean scorecard.
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I did make a bogey, but I didn't make any birdies on the back and take advantage of some opportunities.  I didn't drive it the last six holes very well, and that really hurt me from having birdie opportunities on the two par-5s.
I missed a number of short birdies from 15 feet and less on the front, but then I made two long ones on 8 and 9.  So it was a very unusual round.
I'll take 3-under.  I've got to get it a little bit better off the tee tomorrow.  My iron play has been pretty good, so I should be able to make some birdies if I get the ball in play.
Q. How are you feeling, this being your third week in a row?
PHIL MICKELSON: Healthy-wise I feel pretty good now.  I feel pretty much 100% health-wise.
I have been able to work out at a more normal right.  I feel pretty good.
Q. What are you looking to improve upon tomorrow?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah, I've got to drive it a little bit better.  I also need to make that critical area of about 10 to 20 feet, those birdie opportunities I need to capitalize on.  I missed a number of those today, and those are the ones that can really propel the round.
