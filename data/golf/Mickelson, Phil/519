 Q.   Plenty of Mickelson magic in this round but at the end of the day‑‑ how do you feel about the net take‑away?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   God, I hit it terrible today; there was no other way around it.   I was getting a lot out of the ground, and I just got some mechanical issues where I was not striking the ball very solid.   I was able to hit decent shots on the backside to make birdies and make a run but that last hole stunk.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the mechanical issues are fixable in the short‑term?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, I've been hitting the ball well the last three weeks, and I haven't been able to get much out of the round, so it was kind of nice to be hitting kind of sloppy and getting the most of it.   
But it's not far off, I should be able to dial it in.  
   
 Q.   Is this course success susceptible to the low round you're going to need.   Is everybody that made the cut here still in contention?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It is, they're out there, even with wind.   You're going to have to make 15 to 25‑footers, and the greens are slowing up where you can be aggressive and make some of those putts.   It's hard to get it at 6 feet because of the contouring of the greens, it doesn't really help you very much, but it's pretty easy to get it to 15 and 25.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your day.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I hit it terrible.   I was getting so much out of round.   I was 3‑under on 17 and then had a double.   I have been striking it well the last few weeks and not getting a lot out of it, and today was some of the worst ball striking I've had in a while, and hopefully I will be able to get it fixed before tomorrow's round.   
   
 Q.   If it's any consolation, you are still very much in it.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, there will be a bunching on the leaderboard.   I'll go out tomorrow, and if I could shoot something in the mid‑60s, I'll have a good chance on Sunday.   It's certainly out there.   I mean, the way I hit it today, still could have shot 3‑under, and I didn't hit it very well.   If I give myself some more chances tomorrow, I'm starting to feel a little bit better with the putter, and I should be able to make some.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned doing everything you could on 9.   Take us through 9.   
PHIL MICKELSON:   Well, I started trying to address it with a 5‑iron, and I couldn't get that 5 to feel like it would cut enough, so I tried a 4‑iron, and I couldn't get that to feel like it would cut enough, so I went with a 5‑wood where I felt like I could get it to cut.   I was more making sure the ball would cut so it wouldn't go in the water than trying to get it close, and fortunately it rolled up there well.   
   
 Q.   Phil, do you have a sense of what you need to do to try and strike it better, or do you need to go back to the range?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I've been hitting it really well going into the week, and I don't know what happened today.   It just was fractionally off.   It feels like I'm off the address position a little bit, because I don't feel quite as comfortable as I have.   But I don't think it will take much.   I've been hitting my irons well today, just a little off.   
   
 Q.   Is the wind tricky?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   I would not say it's tricky, because it's not a swirling wind, it's just a consistent, steady, brisk wind.   It's easier to play with when you know what it's going to do.   What is harder is where you get a swirling wind; it's a harder scenario.   You can play well on this golf course if you strike it well.   
   
 Q.   How would you rate that shot in terms of difficulty?   
PHIL MICKELSON:   It wasn't that hard.   It was hard to get it 15‑feet from the hole, sure, but I wasn't more worried about that, I was worried about cutting it enough so it wouldn't go in the water and getting it up there and on the green so it would go in the hole, and fortunately I got a chance to make birdie.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Phil.
