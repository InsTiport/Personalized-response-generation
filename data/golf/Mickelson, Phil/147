Q. You had to come back to beat Bill Haas.  You were in that position of having to come from behind all match?
PHIL MICKELSON: Well, he played really well.  He made seven birdies today and that's going to be enough to do it.  I had a number of chances to keep pace and match him on the front nine.  I struggled making the putts that I have been making all week.  That seemed to me to be the difference.  I had a six-footer to tie him on 3 that I didn't make.  I had some opportunities on 5 and 6 to make some birdies and didn't do it.  Those are the holes or the putts that I look back on.  That eagle on 16, I just didn't get the putts to go in when I needed it.  I had a great chance on 13.  I thought I made that one, didn't quite go.
He played great.  He made seven birdies.  He's a terrific player and I wasn't able to keep pace today.
Q. You played beautifully all week.  I know you love this time of year.  Given the way your game is and the shape it is, obviously your short game, how much confidence do you have going to Augusta National in a couple weeks?
PHIL MICKELSON: I'm certainly looking forward to going there.  I do have the Houston Open beforehand, and I feel as though the way I'm playing I'd like to get myself in contention.  I'd like to give myself an opportunity to win and compete because I think that's the best way for me to be my sharpest and be at my best for the Masters.
