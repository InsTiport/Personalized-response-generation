Q.  How difficult was it to come back and finish the round?
PHIL MICKELSON:  It wasn't difficult to come back.  We had great weather, beautiful day and saw some birdies out there and some bogeys.
Q.  And you had the chance for eagle on 13?
PHIL MICKELSON:  You could look at it that way.  I thought that any time you make a birdie, it's not going to be disappointing.  But I look at it quite a bit, yeah.  I don't know if I would have said that because, I don't know if I was in the mix ever, but, you know, I still have a long ways to go before I would even say that.
Q.  How difficult is it or is it difficult to turn back around and play the final round?
PHIL MICKELSON:  Well, we have a four-and-a-half-hour break, so it's not a big deal.

We'll go home and relax a little bit and come back.
Q.  How is it playing?
PHIL MICKELSON:  As soft as I've ever seen it and as long as I've ever seen it.  Granted we can get at some pins and make some birdies.  I hit 4-iron or 5-iron into 17 and 18.  I may have hit maybe a 9 or an 8, but it's playing very long.
