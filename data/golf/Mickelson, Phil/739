 Q. If you can, describe what this day has been like for you. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It's been a long, hard-fought battle. We had a good match today. Tim Clark played some incredible golf. Both Tim and Vijay played great but Tim on his own ball was quite a few under par. I haven't added it up, but it's low 60s. For Sean and I to hang in there, we really partnered well together today, and we fought hard to stay in this match. I think both sides would have liked to have finished with a birdie and see if we could have won, but it was a fun match and a fun day. 

 Q. I know it's disappointing to play your heart out for more than four hours and walk away all square, but from a spectator standpoint, that was a beautifully-played match. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: It was a fun match, Tim and Vijay played great golf. Tim on his own ball was low 60s and for Sean and I to hang in there and get this match back to even after being a couple down, and fight hard to stay in it; and really have a good chance on 18. Both sides would have liked to have made a four there, but we had a long, hard-fought day and we are certainly not disappointed with the push; but we would have liked the win, though. 

 Q. Talk about your putt. 
 PHIL MICKELSON: Tim hit his third gimmie in there to a foot and a half that he didn't have to putt. We had a 20- and 40-foot look at it. To get it to go in, we were chuckling saying it's time to roll one in and I'll be darned if that didn't roll right in the cup. 
 It was a lot of fun to be part of that match. I thought Tim and Vijay played some great golf. We really fought hard and made a lot of birdies the back nine to stay in that match or get back in that match. Both sides would have loved to have birdied 18, but we fought hard all day and I thought that we paired very well together. 
 I certainly enjoyed my partnership with Sean today, we had a good morning and we fought hard this afternoon against some very strong players. 

 Q. What were you thinking when you stood over that putt? 
 PHIL MICKELSON: I was going to try to take a little bit of the break out and track it up the middle. It wasn't breaking much either way, it was going to move a little to my left but didn't get quite started out high enough.
