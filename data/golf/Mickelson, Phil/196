Q. Phil, 68 today.  Before we get into your around, just a situation on 18.  The chip.  Did you think of ever taking a wedge?  Was the fringe smooth enough to go with putter?  Would you hit the same shot again?
PHIL MICKELSON: It's very difficult to chip around here because the balls sit down so low and the only time I'll clip is down-grain and that shot that I had, the ball was sitting down, into the grain.
It's impossible to get the leading edge of a 63-degree wedge underneath the ball without playing a flop slot.  I didn't want to play a flop shot there because the fringes are being cut so low, it's much easier to putt.
I just didn't commit to the shot because it was so strong into the grain.  Chipping it and landing it short of the green would have been a terrible idea, too, because you saw the way my ball was bouncing up in the air.  That will grab the ball chipping.
I have to fly it on the green.  On the green it was going straight downhill.  I didn't see how it was even a possibility to chip that ball.
Q. Today a lot of burnt edges on the back-9.
You're still rolling the ball so well in great position for the weekend.  Just some thoughts on today and maybe what has to happen to grab that win, Championship Sunday.
PHIL MICKELSON: I need to strike it like I did last week.  I'm going to hit a few more balls.  It's very close.  Rhythm has been a little bit quick, the transition has been quick.  I've managed it so far and I've been putting really well.  Just a few good iron shots like I hit on 8 today, giving myself a few 6 to 10 footers I should be able to capitalize on those the way I've been putting.
I like the fact I'm going to be a group or two in front of the leaders.  I think that's always an advantageous spot if you can get off to a good day.  It's much more difficult to follow birdies than it is to lead by them.
Q. Fun to watch today.  Thank you and good luck tomorrow.
PHIL MICKELSON: I appreciate it.
Q. Did you feel like you found something on the range yesterday?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yeah.  I know that I was swinging a little quick.  My transition is a little quick.  It's causing the club to get steep again which has been the problem I've had the last couple of years.
Last week it was really on.  Like last week my ball-striking was where I wanted it and the rhythm has been a little bit quick.  I'll work on it.  It's not far away.  We've put a lot of work in the last year, I guess six months or so and it's not far away.
Q. Confident that you're not hitting it better and still in contention?
PHIL MICKELSON: It is because I know it's about to click.  I feel like last week I found the ball-striking the way I wanted it.  Hopefully I'll find it for tomorrow's round because it's only going to take a few more fairways hit and a few more birdie opportunities the way I'm putting to try to get this done.
Q. Andrew was going to be in all this week with you?
PHIL MICKELSON: Yes.
Q. The last putt, nice to see that one go down.
PHIL MICKELSON: That was good because I had bogeyed 17.  You can make a bogey out here.  It's a tough golf course.  There weren't a ton of under par rounds today.  You don't want to follow bogey with bogey.  You always want to come back with a birdie or par.  It was a good way to finish the round.
