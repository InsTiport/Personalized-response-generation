 Q.  Solid opening 68 for you?  
MAGNUS CARLSSON: I'm really happy with the way I played.  Just stayed calm and tried to hit really good shots all the way around.   
 Q.  What's been the biggest test for you around here today?  
MAGNUS CARLSSON: The wind and the greens, I struggled a bit, so I'll have to work on that.   
 Q.  In terms of links golf in general, how do you enjoy playing this kind of golf course?  
MAGNUS CARLSSON: I think it's really nice.  It's a perfect way of playing golf I think.  The challenge in the wind and all the mounds, just beautiful.   
 Q.  And obviously after a run of missed cuts, it must be nice to get off to a good start here and maybe feel that the game is finally going in the right direction?  
MAGNUS CARLSSON: I've been playing good but the results haven't been great.  But keep working hard, and hopefully it will go the other way.   
 Q.  Is the mental game a little bit more tested around this kind of course?  
MAGNUS CARLSSON: Yeah, you'll get a few bad lies here and there, but it's a challenge.
