   NOH SEUNG-YUL: I am so happy. I have come here as an invite and I want to play as well as I can. It is a top class event. It is a very big event for me. I won the Malaysian Open and that has given me a lot of confidence. I want to follow KJ Choi and have done well this season. I have had a lot of good finishes this year and that gives me confidence to do well. This is a very tough course though.
