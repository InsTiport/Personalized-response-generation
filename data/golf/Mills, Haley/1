Q.   Just talk about your first tour event, what it was like overall, you know, when you qualified and what you expected and was it the same as what you expected?
HALEY MILLS:   It was incredible.   I mean I never thought I'd have the opportunity to play in an LPGA event whenever I was 18, and I thought about playing on the tour, but this was ten times better than I thought it would be and it was so incredible, and I feel honored to be out here.
I never felt out of place, and that was really cool.   I kept up with the competition, and it was pretty awesome.

Q.   Does it may be confirm how you feel about what you want to do in the future?
HALEY MILLS:   For sure.   It definitely motivated me to work harder so I can get here sooner.

Q.   And you're going to Kentucky? 
HALEY MILLS:   University of Kentucky. 

Q.   And you start in the fall?
HALEY MILLS:   I start this August.

Q.   Okay.   And so you should stay in school.   I'm just kidding.   Do what you want?
