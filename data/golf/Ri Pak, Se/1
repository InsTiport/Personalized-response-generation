Q. Just talk about your feelings being involved in what you see with this event in its first year?
SE RI PAK: Actually, was very excited.  Probably this event will be worldwide, it's going to be incredible for all the kids, the interest in golf.  It's really great.
First tee, I walked in, everybody talked about we are old-time, like last hole we played together as a tournament as a pro, that's a great time.  And at the same time, I can see so many galleries here supporting the women's golf, that was really great and excited.  I really love to see it happening.
Q. Did you ever think for how cool it would have been to have this opportunity for you when you were growing up as an amateur?
SE RI PAK: I dreamed about it, definitely, but you know, Augusta National women were never allowed to play.  All the kids watching, they grow up, dreams of golf, but woman can't possibly play these events but now it's happening.  As I said, that's probably make it a lot more bigger dream for the kids.  That's really lovely.
Q. How important do you think this event is to the growth of the game and speak to what you've seen in the growth of the game, since what you're referring to as an amateur?
SE RI PAK: I'm pretty sure this is going to be a really huge thing worldwide, not only in America, but globally.  And everybody, the kids watching on TV, they grow up the way they are seeing it, so this is going to give a huge impact and motivation for the kids being future golfers.
Q. When Gary and Jack come up here, they are very competitive.  Were you guys like that?  Did you get a little competitive juices flowing and in the back of your mind, worry about who is going to hit it further?
SE RI PAK: Went to the back range and hit a couple shots.  Nancy said, she's the only one of us, she's shortest, so she's trying to whack it.  Pretty sure everybody the same way.
