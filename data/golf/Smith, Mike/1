Q.  How was the course today?
MIKE SMITH:  It was hot.  Brutally hot.  The course was great though.  It's in perfect shape and there wasn't as much wind as there has been in the practice rounds, so it didn't seem to play as hard as it did in the practice rounds.
Q.  You did really well, were there any standout shots from your day?
MIKE SMITH:  Oh, I played good.  I did everything fairly good.  I missed a short putt there on the last hole that I wish I would have made.

But I'm happy with 70 today.
Q.  What are your expectations for the rest of the week?
MIKE SMITH:  Oh, just to keep on doing what I'm doing right now and trying to stay as cool as possible and not exert too much energy, save a little bit for the weekend.
