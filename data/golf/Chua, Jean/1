JEAN CHUA: The course treated me really well today.  I had fun today.  Ai was great.  I actually even told her when I first started playing golf, she was one of my role models, like following her, so she was awesome to play with.  She was really nice.  She cheered on every time I made a putt or something.  So I had fun today.  Yeah, it was good.
Q. So far you're our best Malaysian, your own performance today, happy with that?
JEAN CHUA: Yeah, I'm really happy.  I started pretty well.  I think that was the key.  I started 2-under after I think 12 holes, and I kind of dropped two shots on 14 and 15.
But I kind of made two good save pars on 16 and 17 and I saved par, so I think that was really good.  Because I think after the two bogeys, I was a little bit shaky, but coming in with three pars was good.  But yeah, I started off well, so I was happy with that, yeah.
Q. You arrived yesterday?
JEAN CHUA: I did.  I arrived Wednesday morning at 2.00am.  So I haven't really seen the course.  We were a little slow getting all the yardages but I think it was because the course was still fresh in my mind, I don't have any memories of bad shots, good shots.  It was just whatever I hit today, it was the shot.
Q. Particularly happy with any part of your game today?
JEAN CHUA: My irons was good.  My driver towards the end warmed up a little bit, was good.  So I was really happy with my irons.  Putting saved me quite a bit on the back nine, yeah.
Q. So your game plan for tomorrow?
JEAN CHUA: Probably go out there and do the same thing, have fun.  Maybe make a couple birdies and climb up that leaderboard.  That would be good.
Q. Is this the best start in your four or five appearances?
JEAN CHUA: No, I think my first year was my best start.  I think my very first year I was coming in 2- or 3-under on the final day, too.  So I think that was my best start.
