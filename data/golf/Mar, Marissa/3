 Q.  Real quick, had to show some fight again to win.  
MARISSA MAR: Yeah.   
 Q.  Where did that all come from again?  
MARISSA MAR: I mean, she was playing fantastic.  She made me really pull out some good shots out there at the end.   
I mean, I just didn't have my best stuff today.  I think I was fighting a lot of fatigue this morning, and I really had to focus down the stretch knowing I was tired.   
I had to concentrate a little bit more over some shots, and I just didn't have my best stuff.  Had to dig deep.   
 Q.  What did you hit into 18?  
MARISSA MAR: 18 I hit a 7-iron, solid 7.  I had about almost 140 to the pin.  Just right when it came off the club face I knew it was good.   
 Q.  Birdied 13 also.  
MARISSA MAR: Yeah, 13, that was just, you know, three solid shots into the green and then a good putt right into the hole.   
 Q.  How long was that one?  
MARISSA MAR: I had about 80, 85 yards into the pin for my approach, so I laid up, which was the plan all along.
