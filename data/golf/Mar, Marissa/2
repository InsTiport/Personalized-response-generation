 Q.  Obviously it's hard to talk about the week as a whole yet.  
MARISSA MAR: Yeah.   
 Q.  Can you tell me a little bit about how this week has been for you.  
MARISSA MAR: I mean, exceeded all expectations that I didn't even have.  I didn't have any expectations coming into this week.  But it was an awesome week.  I think Champions did an amazing job putting this event together, and same with the USGA.  It was just under four weeks that they had to put this championship together, which is amazing.   
Yeah, no, completely exceeded all my expectations.   
 Q.  That's fabulous.  About the afternoon match, you got down a little bit, and that's kind of been your M.O., right?  You've been the comeback kid, as we say.  Tell me how you got the deficit.  
MARISSA MAR: Yeah, I mean, she was just an amazing putter.  She made some key birdies and I was just playing steady.  I was just making pars.  I did have a couple bogeys on the front, which she took advantage of and just made pars.   
So, yeah, I mean, she was just so steady.
