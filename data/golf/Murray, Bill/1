 Q.  How was it out there?  
BILL MURRAY: It's a beautiful day.  The greens are perfect.  The rough is much harder than it looks from outer space, and the crowds were relatively well-behaved.   
 Q.  Can you talk about being inducted into the Caddies' Hall of Fame tonight?  
BILL MURRAY: Well, I'll believe it when I see it.  Last time somebody told me something like that it was a caddie, and I ended up being the victim of a practical joke, so we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  Your birdie on the last hole made you some money to get a dollar off Charley Hoffman?  
BILL MURRAY: Actually I did get a dollar off Charley Hoffman.  Here it is.  I got 40 off of each of my playing partners.  I'm going to get myself a new BMW.   
 Q.  Will that go with your John Deere tractor from that pro-am earlier this summer?  
BILL MURRAY: I didn't play as well at John Deere.  I didn't get any vehicles at all.  I didn't get a Gator.  It was hard playing over there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)

 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BILL MURRAY: Well, I thought about him a lot because there were a lot of people handing me things, "Ghost Busters" things today for autographs, so all day long they were just in front of me.  You know, with Brian here and all the talk about "Caddyshack" -- we had an extraordinary run of (inaudible), and we made some really good movies.  We made "Caddyshack" and "Meatballs" and "Ghost Busters".  I'll put those up against anybody.   
 Q.  Are you going to be there, supposed to be at the game?  
BILL MURRAY: I may start, I may relieve, I don't know.  But I'm working on the knuckler.
