Q.   Could you talk a little bit about your round today. 
DON BERRY:   Started pretty good and then I got a little rain delay and didn't play very good coming out of that. 
So kind of held in there for a little while and then made a pretty bad bogey on 18. 
But it was fun.   Played with Steve Pate.   And he played great.   I got to watch that.   So that was worth it. 

Q.   What effect did the rain have on the golf course?
DON BERRY:   I think the greens were a little slower after the ‑‑ certainly a little softer ‑‑ but nothing serious, it was pretty much the same.

Q.   And how are you feeling heading into the final round tomorrow?
DON BERRY:   I got to hit it better than I did today.   So I'm looking forward to one more day of that and hopefully I play a little better.
