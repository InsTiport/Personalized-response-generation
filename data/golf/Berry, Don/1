Q.   So, your round seemed pretty good today.   What are your thoughts about it?
DON BERRY:   Well, I played better.   I putted better.   I just putted so not good the first two days and I putted better today.   I didn't really hit it much better, but I putted better.   That's made for a better score.

Q.   Seemed like the back nine you did pretty good.   Couple birdies there. 
DON BERRY:   Yeah, I bogeyed 9, which was a terrible bogey.   A par‑5.   I 3‑putted. 
Then I played better on the last nine.   So that made me feel better.

Q.   Do you think, was the pin placements, were they easier today than the other days?
DON BERRY:   No, they were very fair.   I wouldn't say they were ‑‑ they seemed not not hard, but pretty good.   I think they were nice to us. 

Q.   So right now you're pretty close to being the top club pro, what are your thoughts about that?
DON BERRY:   Oh, I don't know, I never think about that.   I'm just going to play good tomorrow, I hope, and I hope that I play well and someone plays better and beats me.   It would be good for them.
