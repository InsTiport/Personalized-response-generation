Q.   Get your overall thoughts on your round today. 
DON BERRY:   I just played real poorly, hit it bad, putted worse. 

Q.   Looks like you're right on the line right now, what are your thoughts about having the opportunity to play over the weekend?
DON BERRY:   Well, I don't know, it would be fun to, I know that.   But I don't think I'll make the cut, so I think it will be a moot point. 
But I would sure like to play.

Q.   You got some people back home rooting for you?
DON BERRY:   Oh, yeah, I suppose.   I don't know.
