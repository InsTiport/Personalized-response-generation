 Q.   Talk about your round and I know you had birdies on 8 and 16.   
DON BERRY:   Yeah, I hit it a little better today.   I made a, actually on 8 I hit it right next to the green in two and kind of flubbed a chip and then chipped it in.   
16, I made about a 40â€‘footer, but otherwise I missed a lot of putts.   I missed four in a row from inside four feet on the front nine and kind of struggled with the putter But I hit it better and I've got good feelings about the day.   
   
 Q.   This was your first PGA, Senior PGA as a club pro, kind of maybe recap how your week was, what you'll take away, what you'll remember from this week?  
DON BERRY:   Just a great golf course and getting a chance to play with all these great players.   Shoot, on Monday I came out and played a practice round with Tom Kite and Andy North.   I never played with two U.S. Open champions before.   So just seeing these guys and watching them how they play and stuff, that was really fun for me.   
   
 Q.   Any general final thoughts on Bellerive?  
DON BERRY:   I loved it.   What a great golf course.   Great fans.   It was just fantastic.
