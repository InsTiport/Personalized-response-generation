 Q.  Two straight days 68. When you can stay consistent like that, it's got to be a good thing to start this marathon off.  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yeah, well, that's the thing. I think the thing that I'm concentrating on most is my attitude. As you said, it's a marathon, so trying not get too high, not to get too low, and just try to stay even keel.   
So that's something I've really been working on and trying to do leading up to this week as well. I knew that was going to have to be key.   
 Q.  You weren't here last year.  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Uh-uh.   
 Q.  Medical?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  So that was from, what, 2017?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: My rookie year was 2018, yeah.   
 Q.  So medical at the end the 2018?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: I played eight tournaments on the LPGA and took medical for the rest of year.   
 Q.  And came back this year?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  When was your first event this year?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Australia.   
 Q.  Oh, so you've played a full year.  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yeah, uh-huh.   
 Q.  So just being here, what did you hear going into it?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: I heard that it was really cold last year, so I was prepared for that. Kind of. But I know that these -- I mean, we're at Pinehurst so the name speaks for itself. It's going to be a pretty difficult week.   
And just with the temperatures and the course is playing kind of long and since we've had a lot rain, so it's definitely is difficult -- it's a test for sure.   
 Q.  Have you ever played here before, any of the courses?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: I have not.   
 Q.  So when you first came here, was it he the first time you stepped foot in Pinehurst?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yep. Yes. Well, I played like U.S. Junior Girls in maybe 2010, and it was not in Pinehurst but it was like...   
 Q.  Pine Needles?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yes, it was that. I think it was that.   
 Q.  So when you first got here, first wandered into town, was there any wide-eyed moment at all, like this is Pinehurst, this is the golf mecca?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yeah, I mean, it's just cool to be here and be playing such a big tournament like this here. I think it's really good for our tours.   
So, yeah, it's really exciting to be here. It's a really nice place.   
 Q.  Goals? Obviously six more rounds; a long way to go. When you can plod along even par, one, two, three, is that as good as it gets really out here?  
LINDSEY WEAVER: I'm not sure. You know, you never know how they're going to set it up on the weekends, so we'll see.   
But I think the course plays different every day. Just kind of depends on weather. Yeah, so if I can just keep doing what I'm doing, I think it'll be good. Just going to try to keep the same mentality going into the weekend.
