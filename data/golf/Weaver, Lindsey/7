Q. So I got to say, you are I think one of the only players so far to be par or better every single round so far. How has that kind of transcribed into your game itself? How confident are you feeling in your game?
LINDSEY WEAVER: I kind of just try to stay steady and just level headed. I've just really been working on my mental approach this week. I know this is like exactly -- like they keep calling it a marathon. That's exactly what it is. I feel like I've been here forever.
So I just try to stay as consistent a possible and not get too down when I make a bogey or two. So just kind of keeping that mentality, and going into the weekend I think that should help me as well to stay steady.
Q. This is, like you said, a marathon. What was it like just kind of thinking about this and then having to reset for a brand new course on No. 9?
LINDSEY WEAVER: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. Two different courses, you never know what could happen. Just because you have a good week last week doesn't mean you're going have a good week this week and vice versa.
You never know what's going to happen, so you can't get too big in your britches here. If you have a good couple rounds, there is still a lot of golf left to play. Yeah, just taking it one shot at a time.
Q. What are some things you've learned about your game or maybe your mentality and how you're able to focus or get through this grind?
LINDSEY WEAVER: I wish I would've kind of had this mentality throughout the rest of my year before this, but at least I'm starting somewhere. But, yeah, it's definitely a grind, and it's nice to play with people I'm familiar with and people that I know as well.
But, yeah, it's just kind of take it as it comes and just try to stay as positive as you can.
