  Q. 1-under.
 LINDSEY WEAVER:   Yeah.
 Q. How did you feel out there?
 LINDSEY WEAVER:   Well, I hit it out of bounds on my second shot today, so wasn't feeling great after that.  I kind of just hung in there.  Mentally I knew there was a lot of golf left.  You can't really get too down or yourself with this golf course or it kind of eats you alive.
 Just tried to hang in there, and other than that, made three birdies after that and 1-under.  Not bad.
 Q. Cool.  Describe those birdies for us.
 LINDSEY WEAVER:   Yeah, so I chipped in on the par-3.  4, and then I made birdie on 17, kind of a long 30-footer.
 And then I made a good birdie on 6, which is kind of like a longer par-4.  Just made like a 10-footer.
 And that was it, yeah.
