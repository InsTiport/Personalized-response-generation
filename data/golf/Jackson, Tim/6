 Q. (No microphone.)
 TIM JACKSON: I think I could have gone to school on 8. Sat there three days before it was due, and I had so much going on in my life from a business standpoint. 
 And Austin's 15, 16 years old and he's playin' and I just don't want to miss any of that. 

 Q. What's it like playing with Michael Reid and Don Pooley on this course? 
 TIM JACKSON: He hit it 9 miles, and I said, Hey, I heard you were a "short" player, and he said "I don't know what happened" I'm going to check the ball! 

 Q. Thanks?
 TIM JACKSON: Thanks, guys.
