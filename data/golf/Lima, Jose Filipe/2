 Q. Give us your verdict on the day? 
 JOSÉ-FILIPE LIMA: Niclas played very well, very solid and my game was not very good on the front nine, it was not really the stress because I felt pretty good this morning. But I actually felt I had a mistake in my grip on the front nine and on the tenth my caddie said to me he didn't think my grip looked quite right and I changed it a little and my back nine was perfect. It was just a small mistake but I will make sure I don't do it the next time. 

 Q. Good to finish with a birdie? 
 JOSÉ-FILIPE LIMA: It was satisfying to finish that way, yes, but it was not quite so satisfying because the eagle putt before it wasn't that long. But it was a  good birdie and my up and down for par on the 16th before that was difficult and I am very happy to have holed that. I am happy overall because my season has been pretty difficult up to now but with this result I can be a little bit more relaxed. 

 Q. Considering the problems you have had with your back and your grip etc, second place must be marvelous? 
 JOSÉ-FILIPE LIMA:  It is beautiful. Really I am very happy for me and for my wife and for my caddie and my coach and everybody who is with me for my preparation. I am so happy, really.
