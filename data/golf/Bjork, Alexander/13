Q. You must have feared the worst when you got up this morning but you shot another under par round.  How pleased are you?
ALEX BJÃRK: Yeah, when I got up here, it was really raining a lot and I was warming up in the rain.  It only cleared up like 30 minutes before our tee time but then started to be a little bit windy, so it was tough out there.  So I'm happy, happy with the way I played and the way I fought with the start and I came back in the end.
Q. What's the most pleasing aspect of the game today?
ALEX BJÃRK: I think the mental game actually.  I got a bad start.  I was 2-over after nine and didn't feel too good and then making three birdies the final nine holes, that's the thing I'm most pleased with today.
Q. There have only been three birdies on 17 and 18 all day.  I think that just shows you how tough the final stretch is here.
ALEX BJÃRK: It is, yeah.  Especially today when 18 is also playing into the wind, which makes that a tough hole and 17 is long, even with the wind.  So two long holes, which makes it tough to make birdie and also tricky pin positions, both on 17 and 18.
Q. And going into the second Rolex event of the season, in the final group tomorrow.  That must be pretty exciting.
ALEX BJÃRK: Yeah, should be a lot of fun.  Really looking forward to tomorrow, yeah.
