 Q.  Third in the second Rolex Series event of the year, sum up the week for us?  
ALEX BJÃRK: It's been a great week here.  I'm playing really good.  Final round, I was trying to get out there and really, really play aggressive and try and win a spot.  I was a little unlucky with the putter today, but I made one at the last.  I'm really happy with my third place.   
 Q.  Obviously Tommy Fleetwood shot a 66.  I'm sure you're aware he was quite well ahead at one point.  Do you have to control yourself in terms of trying to chase him down?  
ALEX BJÃRK: Yeah, I saw he was going strong in the beginning there.  At one point I think I was only one back, so I was trying to focus more on catching them than trying to think what's going on below me on the leaderboard.  That was a good thing to try to catch him instead of thinking about the other guys.   
 Q.  Having just come up from The Challenge Tour, what was the main aim for you at the start of the year playing on The European Tour?  
ALEX BJÃRK: Well, I mean, I have a goal which is to play The Race to Dubai final end of the season.  Also, I want to win my first European Tour event.  So those are two things I'm trying to work for this year.   
 Q.  And you've got yourself a place in The Open Championship due to your performance here.  How exciting is that?  
ALEX BJÃRK: I heard, that was the last spot in the British Open.  Yeah, I'm really excited to play there.  It's been like a dream since I was a little kid to play The Open, so I'm really looking forward to that.
