 Q.  A 67 today and you're nicely in contention now going into the final day here.  
ALEXANDER BJORK: Yeah, it was a very good round today.  I felt I was playing actually really good.  Made a few bad bogeys the first nine holes, as well.   
Was only level par the first nine but I felt like I was playing a lot better than that.  It was nice to roll in some putts in the end, then I had a few more that just stayed outside the last two holes.  It was a very good round.   
 Q.  What do you feel has been the strongest part of your game so far this week?  
ALEXANDER BJORK: I will still stick to the iron play but today I was really solid off the tee hitting pretty much every fairway, which helps a lot around here.  So today I was really happy with my long game.  Yeah, overall, a very steady round today.   
 Q.  You're 43 in The Race to Dubai coming into this week.  When you got on to The European Tour, did you set yourself any targets, any expectations?  
ALEXANDER BJORK: I did set myself the target to be here this week, to finish within the Top 60.  So I've done that, but now I look up, so if I have a really good finish tomorrow, maybe I can squeeze into the Top-50 and maybe play some WGCs.   
So tomorrow, play positive and try to finish as high up as possible this week.   
 Q.  If you're two or three shots within the lead, will you go out with a different strategy or just carry on playing the way you have been?  
ALEXANDER BJORK: I will carry on playing the way I played today if I can choose.  I was really happy with the way I played today.  Try to hit good tee shots off the tee, stick with my strategy and hopefully hole even a little bit more putts.  Yeah, that's probably the plan.  Just stick to what I was doing today.
