 Q.  Even with the delay, you managed to get out there and get finished, and another good round.  
ALEX BJÃRK: Yeah, thank you.  I'm happy we finished today because it's so much nicer to have a little sleep-in tomorrow instead of getting up early.  That was good.   
 Q.  Everybody talks about the back nine being good but you haven't dropped a shot on the back nine and you've played it at 4-under par, so where is the difficulty?  
ALEX BJÃRK: There are a lot of tough holes.  I've been playing the back nine really good.  I guess that's why I haven't dropped a shot there so far, yeah.   
 Q.  For someone at the stage of your career now in a Rolex Series event going into the weekend just one shot off the lead, you must be delighted with the position you're?  
ALEX BJÃRK: Yeah, it's a good position.  I think I'm one behind, so I will try to stay positive and aggressive going into the weekend.  Yeah, hopefully I can be there up high in the top when we go into the final nine holes on Sunday.   
 Q.  Is this the kind of golf course you can chase a score on if you need to over the weekend?  
ALEX BJÃRK: I think so, yeah.  I mean, if you hit good shots, you get good birdie chances, and if you hit bad shots, you get a lot of tough lies.  So if you play well, yeah, you can shoot a low round.
