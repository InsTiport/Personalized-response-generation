 Q.  Your thoughts on a 65, especially in your debut here in Dubai?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  A little rough start the first nine holes.  Felt like every after every birdie came a bogey, but then turned around on 9 and 10.  I made a birdie, eagle on the last nine holes, so very pleased.   
 Q.  What particularly pleased you about your play?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: I would say a little bit of everything.  I was much better off the tee than last week.  Good irons and good putting.  Overall, very good round.   
 Q.  Your first look at the golf course this week.  What are your thoughts?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: It's very nice.  It's only, yeah, my third round here.  I played a few practise rounds and really, really liked it.  It's a little shorter than some of the other courses we play, but it suits me quite well and a lot of fun holes.  I like it.   
 Q.  You didn't play so well last week but what does it do for momentum starting with a good round today?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Yeah, very much.  I was a little rusty last week, the first tournament in a while and felt like I was struggling a bit and it's very nice to come out and shoot a low round the first round today.  Yeah, moved forward from that and hopefully can have a good one tomorrow, as well.
