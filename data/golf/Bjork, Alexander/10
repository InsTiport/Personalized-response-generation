Q. Thoughts on a second round 69.
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Not as good as yesterday.  A little up-and-down.  Played subpoena good holes and some not so good holes.  Okay to shoot minus 2-over all.  It was a little tougher.  Some of the greens are in the sun which makes them a lot quicker than the ones in the shadow.
So I struggled a little bit with pace on the greens and also, it's a small wind, so if you don't feel it, it's tough to get the right distance on the approach.  So a little tough for me today.
Q. You're still in contention for this tournament.  What was missing today?
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Well, it's tough to say, because I thought my play was like yesterday.  I don't know, a little bit of everything.  A little wide from the tee sometimes and I hit a little less fairways than yesterday.  Missed a few more greens.  Was a little longer from the pin.  Putted worse.
So yeah, everything was not as good as yesterday.
Q. What positives do you taking just four off the lead?
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Yeah, it's a good position.  I'm Top-10 going into the weekend, just four off the lead.  Yeah, I have every chance in the world to climb up close to the lead tomorrow, Sunday.  So I will take a positive feeling going into the weekend.
Q. What's the plan now for the rest of the afternoon and obviously a long morning tomorrow before you tee off?
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: I think a little bit of practice now.  Not too much, but a little bit, and then have a nice sleep-in tomorrow morning and hopefully come back fresh tomorrow.
