 Q.  2-under today, valiant effort.  Give us your summary of how today went?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: I mean, it was a decent day I would say, but good.  Came out really strong with two straight birdies the first two holes, and then played quite good the first nine holes.  Didn't really hole the putts.  Had a few on the lip.   
Then final nine holes was a bit up-and-down, a few really good ones and a few not-so-good ones.  In the end it was quite a good score.   
It was a little frustrating, just hitting the bunker on 18, and I kind of wanted to give that one a chance to go for two and then maybe compete on the first place.  But still quite a good day.   
 Q.  A couple short, it looks like it's going to be.  But overall, positives to take from the week?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Absolutely.  I was quite frustrated the final three rounds last week.  I was playing good and then started on the same track this week.  I was 2-over the first round and then I was 4-over after I think like two holes the second day, so it was kind of almost going home.   
But then I turned that one back to minus one and then on the Saturday, the same.  Was 3-over after ten, and then six birdies the final eight holes and it was a good turn of events, so I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  You seem to be getting closer and closer over your European Tour career.  What's it going to take to win a tournament?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: I mean, it's the small things.  A few more putts, and, yeah, birdie chance on 18.  I'm only two back at the moment, and I can easily see five shots going better.   
So I mean, just need the margins on your side, but it's tough.  Everyone wants to win and everyone has those things.  Everyone has putts on the edge and other things.  Just keep trying and be positive about it, and it will come soon I think.
