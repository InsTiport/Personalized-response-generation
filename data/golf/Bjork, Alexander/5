 Q.  You dropped a couple shots early on but overall a very good round across 18 holes?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Yeah, it was a good round.  Like you said, a couple bad shots in the beginning.  But I struggled through it and tried to stay positive.  Worked out in the end.  Overall happy with the round.   
 Q.  How much different was it on the front nine with the wind having switched?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: I mean, the entire course played totally different than it did yesterday.  Yesterday was pretty much no wind, so played really easy.  Today with the opposite wind, it played really tough.  So it was a totally different course and it was fun to actually play it.  I think this is the way it's normally played, what I've heard.  It was nice.   
 Q.  Obviously got your first win of the year early on this year.  How excited are you going into contention on in a Rolex Series Event on Sunday?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Absolutely.  You want to be in the position I am and you want to be close to the lead or in the lead.  You want to be in the mix and that's where I am now, so I look forward to tomorrow and hopefully I can be up there.
