Q.   How would you describe your play today?
MATT EVERY:   It was pretty scrappy.

Q.   Yes, it was.
MATT EVERY:   Yeah.   But, you know, I hung in there.   1-over is not really that bad out here today especially if you're not hitting it well.   I didn't hit it very good today. 
But, maybe, that's my bad round and I get it out of the way without checking myself out of the tournament:   Missed a few putts here and there but, overall, not bad.   I have a chance to win.

Q.   You're in great shape.   I thought you showed a lot of moxie there in 18.   Up and down from a tough spot.
MATT EVERY:   Yeah, it was.   I was probably better off in the bunker.   You get on wrong side of some of the humps, you've got no chance.   That was probably the longest putt of the day I made right there.   I made a ton of putts on Thursday, probably took them all for the week.

Q.   You did, but tomorrow now is a new day. They're saying the wind will be more normal tomorrow.   What do you think now about tomorrow?
MATT EVERY:   Every time I play here the wind is blowing like this except for Thursday, so I don't know what normal means.   Normal direction?

Q.   Normal direction.
MATT EVERY:   South more?

Q.   Yeah. 
MATT EVERY:   As long as it blows all day and half the field doesn't get the day off like yesterday.   It's Mother Nature, so, you can't really help it.
