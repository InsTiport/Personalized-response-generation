 Q.   Give us an idea of how the day went out there with the tough conditions, weather conditions out there.  
MATT EVERY:   I'm happy with it, right there going into tomorrow and feels good.  
   
 Q.   As you look back on the round, what are the shots that kept it going for you in the 3rd Round because it was certainly tough out there with the conditions?  
MATT EVERY:   Yeah.   On 2, they put a really poor pin out.   Probably heard about that already.   I putted it off the green and then I got the next one up and down and that was huge because I could have made double there, really would have pissed me off.   Bogey not so bad.   Kept going.   I'm playing well so I know that bogey here and this isn't the end of the world.  
   
 Q.   You like the position for Sunday now what you've been able to accomplish over the first three days?  
MATT EVERY:   I'm hitting it better every day.   Thursday, I kind of scraped it around, made everything.   Friday, I played better.   Today, I -- my irons were amazing.   Hopefully it all comes together.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to Sunday.   
 Thanks, Matt.
