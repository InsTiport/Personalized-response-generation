An Interview With:
MATT EVERY
Q. Matt, that back nine played pretty strong, couple of birdies and a great save for par here at 18 out of the sand.
MATT EVERY: Yeah.  Couldn't get into a rhythm on the back.  I actually was kind of bouncing all over the place.  We waited every hole.  With a drivable hole and a reachable par-5, tough to stay in a rhythm.  But yeah, kept it together and I'm playing pretty good right now.
Q. I wanted to ask you about that because you've put together some exceptional rounds over the last few tournaments, and here again you followed up with a solid first round at the Travelers Championship.
MATT EVERY: Yeah.  I'm just driving it way better.  I'm not reaching.
Q. It's always good.
MATT EVERY: Yeah.  So that's really the only difference is giving myself more opportunities.  And then makes the rest of my game -- puts a lot less stress on the rest of my game, and the fairway.
