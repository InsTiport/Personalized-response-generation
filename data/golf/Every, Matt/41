  Q. Good round. What's going on?   
 MATT EVERY: I appreciate it. I don't know what's going on.   
  
  Q. It's one of those things, it's good, I don't want to mess with it?   
 MATT EVERY: Yeah, I've been hitting it pretty good the last couple weeks. Last week I hit it pretty good, literally did not make a putt, something to do with the desert. I did it at Q-school, too, didn't make a thing last time I played Q-school there, so I'm kind of glad to get out of there.  
  
  Q. You know East Coast guys, we need some humidity to play well.   
 MATT EVERY: Yeah, we do.  
  
  Q. You started out the day with no wind but got a little bit late in the afternoon.   
 MATT EVERY: Yeah, wasn't too much. I didn't see the front nine. I didn't play the front nine this week, so I was just kind of glad to get through that. The back nine was pretty easy. The back pins were tough to get to because the ball was spinning a lot. But other than that, I played pretty solid.  
  
  Q. Talk about the greens. Were they a little bumpy?  
 MATT EVERY: They were better than I thought they would be. Maybe it was because I was rolling it good. But I was happy with them.
