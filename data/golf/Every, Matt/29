Q.   Talk about this final day.   What's going through your mind right now?
MATT EVERY:   Oh, man, a little bummed out.   You know, kind of a pillow fight there for awhile between the three of us.   John got it late.   I missed a few short ones.   I was really nervous probably, why I missed one.   I hit some good shots. 
Played great today except for the last hole.   Overall, I mean tied for 2nd place, wraps up my card for the year.   I don't have to worry about playing that much anymore which is great and, really, first time I played with Ben. 
He's one of the best out here, really solid guy.   So, I was happy he won.   I wished it could have been me but good deal.

Q.   What do you learn from the back-9 because you gave yourself opportunities especially at 16?   That was a good look from four and a half feet or so.   You're fighting nerves and that sort of thing.   This is obviously a big learning experience for you.
MATT EVERY:   Yeah, another learning experience.   Been hearing that for about 15 years.   But I don't know, man.   I mean they got to go in sometimes and it didn't today but it will one day.   Saving for something bigger, maybe.

Q.   Keep plugging way away.   I saw some brilliance in your game today?
MATT EVERY:   Four Top-10s this year.   Really turning my career around.   I'm pumped.

Q. Keep it going.   Thanks.
