  MATT EVERY:   Very good week.   Good way to end the year.   Wish I could have had a couple more strokes come my way.  
   
 Q.   You played 18 aggressively.   Looking at the scoreboard anything can happen with Charlie playing 17.   You were left right in the door there.   
MATT EVERY:   I heard he hit that in the middle.   That's the last real shot you can make a big number on.   I think I'm tied right now with Garrigus.   So maybe he'll make a bogey.   He's got enough money already.   (Laughs).  
   
 Q.   Talk about your year.   It really has been a solid year.   You gotta be excited about next year?  
MATT EVERY:   I am.   I think I have like four or five top 5s.   Trying to get a win next year.   I had my son born this year.   Really has just been a rough couple of years.   The last couple have been rough for my family and I, so it's great to end the year like this and go into next year on a good note.  
   
 Q.   When are we going to see you again?  
MATT EVERY:   Probably Sony.  
   
 Q.   Take some time off?  
MATT EVERY:   Oh, yeah.   Couple weeks.
