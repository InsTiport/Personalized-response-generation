 Q.   Matt Every, 5â€‘under par 67.   Are you happy with that starting off the tournament today?  
MATT EVERY:   Yeah.   It was a good round.   A little cold this morning, but I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   The conditions were a little blustery.   Are you happy you played the easier of the two courses today?  
MATT EVERY:   Probably.   When I saw my time this morning, or on Tuesday when I saw I was going at 6:55 I was like, good.   I play the Palm instead of Magnolia.   
So it was nice to get that out of the way.   Got a good break.  
   
 Q.   What was working for you out there today?  
MATT EVERY:   It really wasn't anything special.   I just didn't make any big mistakes.   Made a couple of eight footers to keep a little momentum going and then drove it good.  
   
 Q.   Were any of your partners a distraction?  
MATT EVERY:   No.   They were fine.   No.
