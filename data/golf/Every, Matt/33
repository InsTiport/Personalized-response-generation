 Q.   Just talk about the round today, disappointed with the outcome but overall for the week, you have to be pretty happy with how you played?  
MATT EVERY:   Yeah, for sure.   Really bummed about my start, because I wasn't that nervous, and I actually felt really good.   I had a great warmup, and, you know, just missed a few putts early and it snowballed.   
   
 Q.   Looked like in the middle of the round you were battling back.   
MATT EVERY:   I hit it really good on the back, missed a few putts, I just burned the edge, and you know, they didn't go in.   
And then 17 and 18‑‑ oh, I birdied 18.   But like 17 and 18, if you don't draw the ball, you've got no chance, and I fade it and I just couldn't get to that pin on 17.   
18, I made a good birdie.   So it could have been a lot worse today with the start.  
   
 Q.   Just another learning experience, I would imagine.   
MATT EVERY:   I've had a ton of them.   
   
 Q.   What's your next event, Torrey probably?   
MATT EVERY:   Probably Torrey, yeah.   I don't think I'm getting in next week.   Probably better that I don't, anyway.
