Q. Matt, after obviously a long day, finally getting 9 holes in out there.  The lead rests on your shoulders.  What did you feel out there, 9 holes?
MATT EVERY: I mean it was like a normal round of golf for me.  Felt like it was playing super easy so it wasn't like I had time to be nervous about anything.  I just needed to keep making birdies.
But I got into a rhythm.  Didn't have to wait on the group in front of us once, I think, which was kind of nice.
Q. You mentioned not feeling any pressure.  Two consecutive days of 65.  Currently sitting at 6-under through the 3rd Round.  What's given you confidence in your game right now?
MATT EVERY: Well, it's not really my game.  I'm a little happier right now than I have been in the past.  Just life is a little better than it has been.
Q. Anything change for you then going into tomorrow as we look forward to the final round?
THE WITNESS: Not much, man.  No.
Q. No pressure, nothing?
MATT EVERY: For sure I'll feel pressure but I don't know when, but I'm sure it will happen but I'll be all right.
Q. Matt, take us through you No. 1, the great start, obviously.
MATT EVERY: I kind of slipped on my tee shot a little bit.  Just kind of scraped one up there and I caught it a little -- the ground was pretty tight by the green and I caught it a little thin.  I didn't see it go in because the pin was over the hill.  That was really nice to get off to a start like that.
Q. You're a PGA Tour winner out here.  Drawing anything from those experiences as you get into --
MATT EVERY: I got to keep my head down and keep going.  Once you start looking over your shoulder out here, it's not going to work.  So, especially -- especially on a course like this where the guys are shooting the grass off of it.  Play my hardest tomorrow and add them up and see where I stand.
