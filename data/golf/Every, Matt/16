 Q.   Another red number for the defending champion, 69.   Are you satisfied with that number today?  
MATT EVERY:   Some were a little tough but other than that, I couldn't have hit it much better.   I just didn't -- wasn't feeling great over my putts.   Didn't make many.  
   
 Q.   Are you working with some stuff tonight to get ready for tomorrow?  
MATT EVERY:   I have to.   I'm not putting it good enough.  
   
 Q.   Finally, memory serves me right you came from behind last year.   How much optimism do you have going into tomorrow?  
MATT EVERY:   If I can make some putts anything can happen.   Right now my ball striking I feel like it's probably the best in the field.   I haven't seen Henrik -- I know he's hitting it good.   I got to make some putts and be right there.
