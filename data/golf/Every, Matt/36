 Q. (Indiscernible.) I know you wanted 62 probably real bad. 
 MATT EVERY: Oh, yeah, well, the greens on the last nine I played were getting pretty rough, spiked up, and it was tough to make any putts. I made a lot of my putts early, so... 
 Made one on the become side, but other than that, I mean, I'll take it.

 Q. Do you think it'll benefit you tomorrow teeing off earlier in the day?
 MATT EVERY: Yeah, definitely. Probably.

 Q. Why is that?
 MATT EVERY: Just there's less traffic on the greens, so, you know, less footprints.

 Q. You shot 7-under and tomorrow you could do better? (Laughter.) 
 MATT EVERY: Well, I mean, stretching it. But, yeah.

 Q. How about tee to green today? I mean, when you get to... 
 MATT EVERY: I drove it really good. Yeah, I drove it great and then made some putts. My irons were pretty standard, but I drove it -- it was in play every hole. So it was nice.

 Q. The way you were playing, did the rain delay do anything to...
 MATT EVERY: No, not really. No. 

 Q. You birdied 16, 17, and 18, playing the back first. I think one other guy on the leaderboard did that. That's where you score, isn't it?
 MATT EVERY: Yeah, well, we got 16, I had that tee shot downwind and then it switched, so it was good to get that shot out of the way downwind.
 And then 17 I had a good birdie. 
 18 I hit it right over the pin and made a nice putt. Yeah, it was nice to pick those right there, but you take 'em wherever you can get 'em out here.
