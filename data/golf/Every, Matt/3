 Q.  Here with Matt Every.  A big birdie for you there on 16.  What was going on for you there coming back from, you know, that delay that we had yesterday and had to be a little weird to restart.  
MATT EVERY: It was.  I got off to a nice start this morning the first few holes and we got to 12, a couple groups on the tee.  Basically started over with a 3-iron.  That just was -- wasn't really good off the bat.   
Then on 16 that was nice, I needed that one to go kind of up a little bit feeling right now.  Lot of golf left.   
 Q.  Yeah, lot of golf left but obviously in contention.  You got off to a really hot start yesterday, turned in 30 yesterday.  What are you going to do to kind of replicate something like that today?  
MATT EVERY: If I knew you that answer, I'd be really rich.  I'm just going to go play as good as I can.  I mean it's all I can do.  I'm going to not try too hard.  That's easy to do.  But, yeah, just be myself, let it come to me.   
 Q.  That's been working for you this week.  What specifically has been working for you?  
MATT EVERY: I don't know.  My attitude has probably been a little better.  I mean I've had my moments out there this week but, for the most part, I'm in a pretty good spot up here so it's good.   
 Q.  That is good.  Good luck for this afternoon out here.  
MATT EVERY: Thanks.
