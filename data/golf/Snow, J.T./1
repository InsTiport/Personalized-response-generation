 Q.   Your thoughts on having this against the 49ers today.   
J.T. SNOW:   The first thing is, it's great because it's for charity and we get up to a hundred thousand dollars for it.   And I had the pleasure last year to play with Ryan Vogelsong, and we ended up winning on a chip off on 18, because it's an all tie carry over.   
So, we won $60,000 on the last hole for a women's shelter here in Monterey.   So, it's fun.   We're all going to hit some good shots, some bad shots and have some laughs.   But, it's all about raising money for the different charities.   So it's good.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a designated charity this year?  
J.T. SNOW:   I think they have a bunch here in Monterey that we're playing for.   And then I think that some of the money goes to the 49ers Community Fund, and then some goes to the Giants and the rest goes to one of the charities here in Monterey.   So, we're not sure what they are.   We get to meet them on the 18th green after it's over, so it's fun.   
   
 Q.   You played this last year?  
J.T. SNOW:   Yeah, last year was my first year.
