 Q.  Talk about your round today. 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  Well, I think it was the certainly the worst of my three rounds so far.  The golf course didn't play as hard as I think it did early in the week.  I let a few get away.  So I'm pretty unhappy with my round. 

 Q.  You came here as one of nine PGA club professionals to make the cut.  Did that enter into your thinking at all? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  No. 

 Q.  What about the special presentation they do for the club professionals? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  That's a nice touch and hopefully it's me, but we'll just have to wait and see.  But that's nice for them to do that. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  No, I don't think so.  I've been playing pretty well most of the week and today it was definitely my worst round. 
 I didn't make a few eight, ten footers that I needed to make to try to keep the round going. 
 I missed a short one on 16 to kind of let things get away a little bit. 
 But it's a hard golf course and, but it can be beat.  I think that with a good round tomorrow I can makeup for some of the mistakes today.
