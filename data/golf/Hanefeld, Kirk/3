 Q. Just a quick overview of your game today. Start to finish. 
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, teeing it up at 7:30 this morning trying to finish the second round, that was tough. I did not finish very well this morning. 
 I got off to a decent start this afternoon and finished poorly again. So overall not very good today. Played okay the first day, but these last two days not very well.

 Q. Course conditions?
 KIRK HANEFELD: The course was okay. It really hasn't changed much since the first day, it's a little dryer, playing about the same difficulty, but I just didn't make any putts and I hit a few iron shots that were a little loose.
