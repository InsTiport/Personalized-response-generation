 Q. What was the difference between today and yesterday? Just ball striking a little more consistent?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, I got off to such a poor start yesterday, I just had just one of those nightmare front nines and it just kind of got away from me. And I shot 43 my first nine and then I played 2-under the last 27 holes. 
 And today I hit it pretty good, I putted decent. I'm happy with 70, just to be able to play the weekend.

 Q. Sure. As I say, you've now played in this event four times and made all four cuts, did you lean on some of that experience, knowing what you had to do today?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Yeah, I kind of knew the number in my mind. I was thinking it was probably going to be 46 or 47 was going to be the number. And I was kind of on that number most of the day. 
 So it was a tough day to play because I knew what it was. And I made a good birdie on 16 to get me to five, so I had a little bit of breathing room anyway. 
 But 17 and 18 of course are bears, and so lucky to make two pars. 

 Q. Sure. Now, you played today knowing you had to shoot a score. Now you go into the weekend, can you relax a little?
 KIRK HANEFELD: I think so. The golf course is just playing difficult. And you got to drive the ball in the fairway and you got to keep it under the hole. 
 So you can't relax, because if you do the course is going to come and bite you. But it's nice to play the weekend and hopefully I can keep hitting it good and maybe make some birdies.
