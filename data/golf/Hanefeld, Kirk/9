 Q. Thoughts on your first day?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, it was an interesting day. I got off to such a bad start and I shot 7 over par on my first nine holes and I brought it in a couple under coming in. But just to get myself to a point where I hopefully can make the cut. I don't know what the scores are like. But I just kind of threw everything away early on, just some bad breaks and some bad shots and it just added up to a horrendous score and I hung in there to just kind of make it so so. 

 Q. The sun drys out the greens and the winds kind of get higher, the scores have gone up in the afternoon, how can you transfer that into tomorrow?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Tomorrow I need to shoot under par tomorrow. Which I know I can do, I just have to do it. And, but if I hadn't shot a good second nine today, it wouldn't really make much difference. But now I have a chance.
