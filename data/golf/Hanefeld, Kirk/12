   KIRK HANEFELD: When we started this morning the wind was coming from the complete opposite direction so everything was a little bit of a guess. It was very tough going out which are some of the easiest holes on the golf course, but because of the wind direction, they played difficult. I got through the first nine holes at 1-under then we had all those holes downwind coming in but I didn't take advantage of a couple of opportunities. Overall, I'm very pleased how I played though.
 The winds are a little bit down now (at end of his round) from when we started, but it was blowing a bit all day and it made club selection more difficult than in any of the practice rounds. I think it's going to be a different golf course every day.
 This is my third Senior British Open and I've played pretty well in both of the others. You get up in the morning and see what you've got with the weather and do the best you can and keep trying.
