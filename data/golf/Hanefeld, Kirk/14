 Q. Kind of give me a run down on today's round. 
 KIRK HANEFELD: Yesterday's round was very solid, except for the last hole. And today if you hit the ball in the rough you just struggle all day. Doesn't make any difference who you are. 
 And I had to hit it out to the fairway way too many times. It was way too much work today. I had a few good holes. But half the holes I had it in the rough and it was a struggle the whole day. 

 Q. Just having trouble driving the ball?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, I won't say trouble, you don't have to miss it by much to miss these fairways. But when the ball went in the rough, then everybody's got the same story, it's just a grind. So I need to drive it better the next couple of days to have a chance to compete. 

 Q. Talk about your birdie on the par-3. 7. 
 KIRK HANEFELD: 7? No, I birdied 10 and 11. On 11. Yeah, that was a long putt and of course you don't expect to make that. But it was probably a 30-footer, whatever, and I made a probably a nice 12-footer on 10. 
 I started out with a birdie on 1 from about 12 feet. 
 I stiffed it on 2 to about six feet and missed it. 
 Then I ran, ran into some problems by hitting it in the rough. And couple of good strokes here and there, but just way too many mistakes. 

 Q. This is the third year you've made the cut at this event?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Third year I played in it. 

 Q. Is your goal to make the cut?
 KIRK HANEFELD: No. No. My goal is to compete. I don't even know what the cut's going to be. So I made the cut by a lot, but, no, I'm here to try to do some damage.
