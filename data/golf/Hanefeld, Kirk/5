 Q. How did round two go for you today?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Worst round in probably 20 years. So that pretty much sums it up. I shot 82. It was a tough day right from the very beginning and I'm kind of glad I'm done. 

 Q. Was the altitude a factor for you?
 KIRK HANEFELD: No excuses, the weather was tough and the golf course was great, conditions were great, I just played poorly.
