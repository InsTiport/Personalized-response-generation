 Q. Some thoughts on your round today?
 KIRK HANEFELD: The golf course definitely played significantly harder today. When I got here this morning the wind looked like it was blowing from the same direction and it didn't look too bad, but by the time we stepped to the first tee, it was howling and it never stopped the entire day. It was tough out there. It was at least a couple shots harder than yesterday.
 I only had one hiccup today. I made a double bogey on the third hole when I hit it in a fairway bunker and made a six. Other than that, I played pretty solid most of the day. Even par on this golf course under the conditions...I'm pretty happy.

 Q. What was the biggest difference between yesterday and today? 
 KIRK HANEFELD: Just the strength of the wind. Almost every single hole on the front nine we were hitting four or five clubs more than we did yesterday and having to hit drivers on holes where yesterday we were hitting fairway woods and hybrids. Very, very difficult tee to green. It's a grind and a test out there for everybody. The guys that are under right now are going to be busy the rest of the day and have their hands full.
