 Q.  How did you play today? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  I shot 73, struggled a little bit.  Missed a lot of greens on the front nine.  Got it up-and-down a bunch of times and made a couple mistakes on the back and not too much excitement today. 

 Q.  The overall experience? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  Oh, yeah. 

 Q.  Respectable for being a club pro in comparison, how has that been? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  It's been terrific.  I mean, any time a club pro has an opportunity to play in a senior Major like this it's a special thing. 

 Q.  Any special highlights of who you played with or shots you hit? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  Certainly not any shots I hit.  But I played with a great bunch of guys every day.  Everybody was terrific. 

 Q.  When will we see you next on the TOUR? 
 KIRK HANEFELD:  I'm taking next week off for my son's high school graduation.  But I have U.S. Open qualifying coming up the week after and I'll be in Des Moines in a couple weeks.
