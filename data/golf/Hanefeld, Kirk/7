  Q. Tell us about your round today. How you felt about it.   
 KIRK HANEFELD: Not real good. I was pretty sloppy early on. I made the turn in 3-over. Didn't make any birdies. I made a couple of just kind of stupid bogeys.   
 And I made a double on No. 11 to go 5-over for the day and I really was going in the wrong direction. And I made three birdies coming in to salvage a 73. So it was not a good round, but it wasn't a disastrous round either.  
  
  Q. What were your expectations coming into the week and then making the cut and playing here on the weekend and how have your expectations not only for the weekend but now going into tomorrow?  
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, I have to have a good round tomorrow. I haven't broken par yet. And I know I can. I know it's possible. So I hope to be able to break par tomorrow and move up the leaderboard a little bit and have a respectable finish.   
  
  Q. And as you know there's a special presentation for the low club professional in the field. Does that enter your thoughts at all?  
 KIRK HANEFELD: No, Chris Starkjohann is playing so well this week he has pretty much a handle on that. So, no, it's not really a consideration.
