Q.   First I want to wish you a happy 56th birthday. 
KIRK HANEFELD:   Thank you.

Q.   I hope it was all the best and it was a good day for you. 
KIRK HANEFELD:   It was a good birthday, but I didn't play well today.

Q.   How did you like the course conditions compared to the practice rounds?
KIRK HANEFELD:   I didn't putt today and the wind blew hard and the greens got trickier than they already are and so it made it difficult for scoring. 
I played okay for a while and then I finished very poorly.   I shot 80 today.
