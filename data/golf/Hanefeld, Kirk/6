 Q. This is the fourth time in the Senior PGA Championship. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience this week?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, very positive overall. I played reasonably well my last 63 holes. I think I was 1-over for the last 63. I just got off to such a bad start on Thursday, I was trying to play catch up all week. But overall not too bad. 

 Q. Was there anything that stood out this week any certain hole or something that you'll take back?
 KIRK HANEFELD: No, I mean having had a chance to play with Greg and Ian today was really a thrill for me. I had a chance to play with Greg last year at this same event at Oak Hill. But no, it was a lot of fun to be able to play with a player like that.

 Q. What do you think that you'll be able to take away from this experience?
 KIRK HANEFELD: I think I handled being in that kind of an atmosphere a little bit better than I did last year. Hopefully I can build on that and it serves me better in the future.

 Q. Do you have any future plans for any tournaments this summer or later in the year?
 KIRK HANEFELD: Yeah, I go to Des Moines tonight to try to get in a Champions Tour event there. I got to qualify on Tuesday, so hopefully I get to play next week.
