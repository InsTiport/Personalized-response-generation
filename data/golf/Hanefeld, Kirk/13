  Q. Talk about your round today?  
 KIRK HANEFELD: Not very good. Just played pretty good, I just got nothing out of it. It's the kind of golf course where you almost have to hit perfect shots to be rewarded. And I hit a lot of good shots that just didn't really turn out to be all that great.   
 But it's just a lot of beginning. I felt like my game was pretty ready, but it was about hitting perfect shots this week and I hit a few, but -- and a lot of good shots that just didn't end up being pretty good.  
  
  Q. What do you take away from playing in a Major Championship like this on such a prestigious course?  
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well it was a lot of fun. The golf course is terrific. The tournament was run very well. The PGA of America should be proud of the job that they did here.   
 I played in 12 Majors over the last three years and this is the hardest golf course I think I've played in any of the Majors over the last three years. But very fair. It was very hard, but it was very fair.
