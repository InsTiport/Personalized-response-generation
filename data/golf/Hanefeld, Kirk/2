 Q. Talk about your day, first of all. 
 KIRK HANEFELD: Well, it was another tough day. The wind was blowing pretty good. The golf course was set up pretty hard. It played long. I got off to a bad start, made double bogey on my first hole. And then tried to kind of keep it respectable for most of the day and ended up shooting 76, so a few good shots here and there but just not enough.

 Q. Talk about your week overall. 
 KIRK HANEFELD: Overall, very positive, probably the longest week playing golf, with the starts and stops and the golf course being so wet and the tough walking conditions. 
 I don't think I've been more physically tired at the end of 72 holes than this week. But overall it's been a great week, the PGA did a great job with the whole tournament.
