Q.  3 under par today, tell me a little bit about that.  That's a heck of a score out there today.
KIRK HANEFELD:  I was very pleased with that.  I made a couple of hiccups during the course of the round, but for the most part pretty much as good as I could play.  It was tough conditions again today and the golf course was very hard.  And I was very happy with the final result.
Q.  Just overall, tell me a little bit about your four rounds that you've played here this week.
KIRK HANEFELD:  Well, I played really good today, I played pretty good the second round, so so the first round, and yesterday the 79, I just, I let it get away from me a little bit.  The wind was just really tough.  And 79 was a bad score, although I didn't really feel like I played anywheres near that bad.  I came back today with a good score.  So that was great.
Q.  What went well for you today?
KIRK HANEFELD:  Everything went well.  I made some putts like you're supposed to do.  But in conditions like this, I think it would have been a pretty good score on a calm day.  On a windy day like this, I think that was exceptional.
