Q. You shot 68 today, but quite a story that you have to tell.  You probably didn't think you would being playing golf today, did you?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: No.  When I woke up this morning I had some serious dizziness, and they had the physician on site come and see me.  I was not in good shape.
Eventually I was driven away in an ambulance to the hospital.  They filled me with two bags of fluids.  They said I had severe dehydration and vertigo.  I've never experienced that in my life.
I woke up and the room was spinning.  I thought, Oh, man, this is not good.
Q. Tell us how long it took you to get back to the golf course and how close to your tee time?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: As you know, if you go to the ER, nothing is quick.  I was trying to speed them along, telling them the situation.  They got me out of there, but I was still in the hospital bed an hour before my tee time.
Thank goodness there was a slight fog delay, and that gave me an extra, what, 20 minutes I think to get here, clothes on, try and get some food, and on the practice tee.
