Q. What are your initial thoughts when you get here to THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Well, the first thing you notice is the changes when you drive in.  The last time I was here was for the WEB.COM finals, so it's changed a lot since then and it's just beautiful driving in, it's a different look and it looks wonderful.
Q. Have you had any experience playing the Stadium Course before this visit?  Had you played it in the past?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: No, I played it in a pro-am a long time ago and with the new changes, everything looks fantastic.  The greens are, they're a different grass on the greens now and it just looks, it really looks like as good as we play all year.
Q. This field is 55 of the top 60 in the world, talk about the strength of the field and how difficult it likely is to win this tournament.  We haven't had too many first-time winners.
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Right.  This is probably your strongest field in golf.  That's including Majors.  So obviously there's not many first-time successes out there, but who knows, nobody knows, so I'm excited to play and anything can happen.
Q. Is there anything that maybe you didn't expect that surprised you about the tournament?  Maybe the locker room or just something that you noticed when you arrived?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Yeah, just the amount of people.  Just the fans on Tuesday coming out to watch all the players and just all the support from the spectators is just overwhelming.  And then also we had our own walking scorer yesterday for a practice round, which is unheard of, that never happens.  So that was pretty cool.
