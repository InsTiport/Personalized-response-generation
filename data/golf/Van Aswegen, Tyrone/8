Q. Can you just describe, it was a 9-iron from 150 yards on 16.  Just describe the reaction when you hit the shot and what happened.
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: So yeah, it was a 9-iron, and pin was front left.  And we couldn't actually see the bottom of the hole.  We could just see the flag.  I hit it really good, and it was just left of the flag.  And I said, "Come down," because I hit it really sweet.  It pitched, and the greens are real soft, and it pitched and spun back.  I couldn't see where it went and the people behind the green went crazy.
Q. Is this your first ace on the PGA TOUR?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: On the PGA TOUR, yeah.
Q. Have you had one elsewhere?
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: In competition I had one on the Web.com at the BMW Pro-Am.
Q. But no car.
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: No, I was just telling them the story now, I was disappointed, because there was a car on the back of the tee box when I made that hole-in-one.
Q. Quicken Loans, they have the sweepstakes; you've made a fan in Wisconsin mortgage-free for a year.  What do you think about that program, and you have to be pretty happy for that fan.
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Absolutely.  Any time we can help someone pay off their bills, that's great, and I think Quicken Loans has done such a great thing in the market with that.  Yeah, I'm real excited for whoever -- hopefully it was a really big house and a big payment.
Q. I know 17 is not an easy par 5, but then you have this 1, and then you card a 6.
TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: I made a complete mess, yeah.  I was obviously excited and I hit my drive just a little bit right, and the fairway bunker there, it's like a water hazard really.  You hit it in there and you're just hitting sand wedge.  So I hit sand wedge into another bunker.  Yeah, it was a mess.
