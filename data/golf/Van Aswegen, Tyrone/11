Q. Talk about today's 66.  What was the key for you today?TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: I definitely hit some really good iron shots.  I had a couple good bounces.  One chip in on par-3, and went straight in the hole, didn't bounce.  So kind of lucky.  But I've played solid from the fairway, and I'll go to the practice tee and work on my driver and 3-wood.  It was a little bit rusty.  Other than that, it was a good day.  I putted well, and I was pretty excited about the rest of the week.Q. The course is playing firm and fast.  Now the wind is kicking up, which is helping us on these par-5s.  But you've got to like the way the course is playing?TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Yeah, 16 and 18 are downwind and playing really firm.  If you just get your ball to land on the fairway, it's rolling 60 yards.  So now it's drying out this afternoon.  It's going to be playing even faster than that.  So, yeah, the course is in great shape, and it should be a good week.Q. Excited about the rest of the week?TYRONE VAN ASWEGEN: Definitely.  I'm excited to have a good tournament.
