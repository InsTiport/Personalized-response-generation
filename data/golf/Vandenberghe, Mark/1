  MARK VANDENBERGHE:   This is obviously their event and it's their job and it's my hobby.   So I was very conscious about that all the way around and it was really important to me that they didn't know that I was there.   Both the guys made me feel very comfortable. 
So actually I felt like I relaxed more quickly than would have done in a normal tournament event.   It was great.   Absolutely great. 

Q.   Colsaerts shot 9â€‘under par yesterday and he's going backwards.   Having played this monster, do you understand why they call it the toughest golf course in South Africa? 
MARK VANDENBERGHE:   Oh, yeah.   It's an awesome golf course.   To watch Lee shoot 65, it was just amazing to watch.   And it could have been better.   He missed a couple of putts.   He holed a lot of putts but missed a couple of short ones.   I would have loved to have seen him beat that course record of yesterday and then I could really go home and say, that was awesome.

Q.   You yourself, how many points did you add to the team?
MARK VANDENBERGHE:   I think I came in around five holes.   There was a couple of holes where I parred where I had a shot, and two or three bogeys where I managed to get a par.   It was great, really great.
