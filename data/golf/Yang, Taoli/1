 Q.  How does it feel to be in the lead after round one?  
TAOLI YANG: This year thus far there will be one day up on the leaderboard, and I'm very happy for this day.  I feel very good, especially on the back nine playing.   
So I still feel I was able to lead the way, and hopefully I want to stay there for a while.
