Q. How much does it mean to hear stuff like that from people watching, that you inspired all of them?
CHIA YEN WU: No, I didn't see anything.  I just focused on my golf.
Q. Tell me about today.  You played well again today.
CHIA YEN WU: Not very well.  I got one double.  Back nine I played better.  She played very good.  She got four birdies -- three or four birdies on the back nine.  On 18 she played really good.  Yeah.
Q. Were you really tired when you started this morning?
CHIA YEN WU: Not really.
Q. Because you just focused on your golf?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah.
Q. Tell me a little bit about just your game today and your putting.
CHIA YEN WU: Today first nine I think my muscles and my body feel tired, so my iron distance changed, yeah, so I can't make a birdie.
Q. So you didn't have as many good looks today as you did yesterday?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah.  I think, yeah, I'm a little tired.
Q. Did you feel more pressure when you were playing today or just excitement?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah, excitement.  Same yesterday.
Q. Did you get a lot of phone calls and text messages about the match yesterday?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah, but my mom told me don't care about that.  Just do yourself.
Q. Did you talk to your mom for a long time after?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah, like 20 minutes.
Q. Where is she now?
CHIA YEN WU: She's in Taiwan.  My dad in Taiwan.  They tell me, you're very good.  We think you can make it to the final round.  You're good.
Q. Did that help you coming into today?
CHIA YEN WU: Yeah.
Q. Is it tough playing without your parents here?
CHIA YEN WU: No.
Q. You're used to it?
CHIA YEN WU: Not really.  If I play golf, I will just focus on my golf.
Q. How would you wrap up your overall experience here in San Diego?  It's your first Women's Amateur.
CHIA YEN WU: Pretty good experience.  Like match play, if I lose like 2-down in 15, make birdie, and I can turn back like yesterday.  Yesterday I'm not make birdie, she got bogey.  So if I'm really nervous, I think, yeah, I'm good if I not make it.  It's okay.  So I'm not that nervous.
