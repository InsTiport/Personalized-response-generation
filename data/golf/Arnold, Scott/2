Q. What was it like today?SCOTT ARNOLD: It's playing pretty easy, to be honest.  It's not too much breeze around now.  The course is a bit soft from the rain this morning.  They've got a few pins out there that are tucked away, but all in all if you hole a few putts, you can really score.Q. How do you feel about your round?SCOTT ARNOLD: A little bit disappointed.  I played okay this morning, just didn't give myself enough chances really, and then played really well on the back nine and just didn't make any putts.  It's one of those things, one of those days, but you know, happy to be here for the weekend, I guess, and that's a positive thing.Q. (Inaudible.)SCOTT ARNOLD: Yeah, definitely, yeah.  I holed a few putts, which was nice.  I said to my caddie coming up 17, I said, I really only holed putts the first seven holes of my first round and the last seven holes from last night's round, so hopefully tomorrow we can hole a few more and see what happens.  I'm playing quite nicely.  I'm happy with how I'm hitting the ball, so this is the chance of knocking a few in.Q. Is this your first Open Championship?SCOTT ARNOLD: Yeah, first one.  It's great.  Obviously I don't think you get much of a buzz because you're teeing off first group and you miss all the crowds, but obviously very pleased to be here, and just going to enjoy the moment, really.Q. What do you need to work on?SCOTT ARNOLD: Well, I don't think I really need to work on much.  I feel like I'm putting on, I'm just hitting a few bad ones here and there.  All in all I feel like my stroke feels okay.  I've got to read the putts a little bit better and maybe get the pace a little bit better and see what happens tomorrow.
