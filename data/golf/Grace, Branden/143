  BRANDON GRACE:   You have to stick to it and keep going.  
   
 Q.   Which is the harder par‑3, 7 or 8?  
BRANDON GRACE:   Definitely 8.  
   
 Q.   Which is harder?  
BRANDON GRACE:   I think 8 and 7 is definitely the harder one in my books.   I hit a perfect drive down there on 7 and I was unlucky, it bounced left and instead of bouncing right it went in the bunker.   You're screwed, you can't do anything about it.  
I played really well.   Obviously I had a good start and that felt good.   I felt really confident and really positive out there.   Obviously you're going to make mistakes.   It's just keeping the damage small and things like that.   I was a little bit unlucky on the first hole.   I had a perfect second shot which I thought couldn't go long.   And just a bit unlucky.   It's one of those that I thought a Texas wedge would do the trick.   Everybody says that a bad putter is a lot better than a bad chip.   And then the bogey.   And it was a bad swing on the second, which cost me two shots there.  
I took the chances when I had them.   And obviously I made a lot of par putts and things that kept us through the round.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDON GRACE:   Obviously it's early stages.   It's one of those, on this course, I think 71 is a great score.   I'm definitely still in the running.   I know it's early in the week.   A couple more of those and we'll see where it ends.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit for eagle?  
BRANDON GRACE:   I pushed the drive‑‑ I'm not really comfortable on the tee shots and I spun out of a driver down the right.   And I had a pretty decent lie, actually it went exactly where the crowds are standing.   I thought a good lie in the rough.   I had 220 out to the pin at the back.   And I thought it's a perfect little punch 3‑iron with a little fade because there was a little bit of trees hanging over.   It just came out perfect.   I didn't think it was going to be as close as it was.   And the putt was good at the end.   
   
 Q.   When you had that little incident where things aren't going well, what do you do to right yourself?   What do you do when there's a problem?  
BRANDON GRACE:   I think what you want to do is step back, take your time and assess things and just stick to your routines and to your game plan.   Obviously on a course like this there is some demanding tee shots and you are going to make mistakes, it's just keeping the damage small and things like that.  
I knew this is going to happen sooner or later.   You are going to make mistakes out there, so it's just a matter of accepting and moving on.  
   
 Q.   Was it a matter of limiting the damage or making up for it as the round went on?  
BRANDON GRACE:   Definitely.   It's more of limiting your damage.   I had a shot which I went for, I didn't pull it off.   I felt‑‑ I had the option of going out to the right but I thought the lie and towards the outside was a lot tougher than the one I wanted to take on.   It's one of those.   But I'm happy with how I played and things like that.   Looking forward to the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   And the hole you were referring to just now?  
BRANDON GRACE:   The second hole.
