 Q.  You've just come off the course.  How is it looking this year?  
BRANDEN GRACE: It's good.  I must say it's in some of the best condition I've seen.  I know with the drought that's been going on, the guys, the greenskeepers around this place have done an amazing job so far and I think it's only going to get better as well.  It's firming out and the greens are getting quicker, and I'm really happy to be here.   
 Q.  You and Louis out there, what did you learn?  
BRANDEN GRACE: From him, I don't learn anything, but no, we were unlucky, we only had one hole.  Would have liked to play a couple more, but with the weather at this place, you never know.   
It's always nice to play with a fellow mate of mine here, a fellow South African, at a place like this and just go around and having a blast.   
 Q.  It's a very important part of the season.  Nice to get this one in the bag for the South Africans?  I think Trevor Immelman was the last to win around here.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, the foreigners need to go home a little bit.  We need a South African winner (laughing).   
I think it's been lacking for quite some while.  We've got a good couple of guys in this year and guys that have actually been playing well the last couple of weeks coming into this week.  Hopefully for South Africa's sake, it can be a South African winner.   
 Q.  You don't judge your season necessarily about money and points; it's about titles.  How would you judge your season?  
BRANDEN GRACE: It's been good.  Every year is different.  I had a good couple of years leading into this one but this year has been good.  Defending the title in Qatar was pretty special, and getting the win in the States was really good, as well.  Opened a lot of doors for myself.   
It's been a steady season, some good performances in the majors which have been nice, and that's where I want to keep knocking.  So it's been good.  A little bit slow towards the last couple of months, but I feel the game is coming along nicely.  I'm hoping for a big final push.   
 Q.  And which areas of the game are going to have to be on song to score well?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I think pretty much everything.  It's brutal out there, especially when the wind starts swirling a bit.  The wind, you think it's off the left and then it's off the right.  I said to the guys, it makes Amen Corner look like nothing.   
It's tough to hit the fairways, the rough is brutal and it's tough to hit the greens.  All aspects of your game have to be on and really the guy that's going to be playing the best golf is going to win at the end of the week.   
 Q.  Is it the type of course that helps if you know it well?  There are a few first timers.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  I think it's one of those, the more you play it, the more comfortable you get around this place but you still have to do it on the day.  You're going to get a guy that's going to go up there, first time here and he's going to shoot a score, and it depends on the weather.  You can come out early in the morning and shoot a number and you can go out in the afternoon and struggle.  It's about what the course has to offer.   
 Q.  Martin Kaymer commented on how low the scoring is.  Is that surprising given how tough the course is?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Last night they said, I think Ernie has got the record on 25-under.  I can't see that it.  It's definitely not going to happen this week, let me put it that way.  It is, it's a tough golf course.  The guys have been shooting a lot lower than guys are expecting.  But if you get it going, you can shoot a good number.  It just if you can manage it on all four days.   
 Q.  You play events all around the world.  Off the course, how does it compare?  
BRANDEN GRACE: There's nothing like it honestly.  It's a great week.  For me growing up as a South African, this is our African major.  This is what we dream of.  This is the tournament we want to play in.   
I was actually a little bit scared coming in this week, knowing that it's 64 guys.  We didn't know what to expect.  The guys have put on a great show so far.  I think it's only going to get better with the beach party tomorrow and the braai in the bush is going to be fun and it gives the first timers here, as well, gives them something else to see.   
 Q.  Makes concentrating on the golf a little more difficult.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's hard, especially with the casino here, as well.  You try to enjoy it a little bit more off the golf course, as well.  It's a fun week and great week to bring the family out here and enjoy the time and great to be back in South Africa in front of your home fans.
