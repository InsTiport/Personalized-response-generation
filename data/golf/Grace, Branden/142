 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it was tough.   I didn't really think I played too badly.   I think I was pretty good from tee‑to‑green the whole day.   And just unlucky with the finish there, I didn't really hit a bad drive on 17, just ran literally half a foot into the rough and got a bad lie, and I knew it was going to fly, and that's exactly what it did and ended up in a place you didn't want to be and made bogey.   There on 18, same story, I thought I hit a good drive down to the right.   I wanted to hit one of my low stingers down there.   It didn't fly 230, which I thought was a bit bizarre, but maybe there was some water on the ball as it started raining the last couple.   Other than that I thought I played good.   Just the putts didn't want to go in.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Definitely.   I actually thought it got ‑‑ I can't say easier, but I enjoyed it more when the wind came up.   I think the first couple of holes with no wind, everybody says you can play more attacking golf.   But it's a lot longer without that little bit of breeze from behind.   So I thought I played well through the first three.   If you're level par through the first three you've done fairly all right.  
Then I played really good from there, gave myself a lot of chances.   The putting was never there today.   I kept hitting good strokes but obviously not the lines, and it just didn't go.   Otherwise I would have really thought it was an unlucky day today.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, I hit all the tough drives, the tough shots out there I pulled off, so I was very happy about that.   I think 18 was the only one which I didn't pull off, which I still thought I hit a decent drive, it just didn't fly for some reason.   And that was it.   Otherwise I've hit pretty much all the fairways that I wanted to hit and things like that.   I really felt comfy out there.   I felt I was playing well.   3‑over is definitely not the score I could have played.   I could have played at least level or under par the way I was hitting the ball if a couple of putts went in.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, I'm happy.   Like I said, I'm still hitting the ball well.   It was just one of those days where nothing went my way.   For instance, I got on the 16th, waited for the green, hit a superb drive down there, it was a pot bunker, front edge.   And looking at it, the ball flight was left of the bunker, and I got there and it was in the bunker, and the ball literally pitched pin‑high to where my ball was and pitched sideways into the bunker, and there wasn't even a slope.   So it was just unlucky things like that.   Otherwise I was two‑putting or one‑putting for eagle or two‑putting for birdie, and then it's a whole different ballgame coming in.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Not really.   I think my speed was good, which was a positive out of today.   I kept giving myself the chances.   I didn't leave a lot of putts short.   In the beginning I did a little bit.   I think you're always going to be tentative on the first couple, but after a while I started hitting good putts.   
The speed was good.   I kept hitting it two, three feet past and things like that.   But like I said, I just didn't put the line and the speed together today.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Definitely.   You know, it would be superb if a South African could win this one.   I've got a feeling Ernie is going to pull it through.   He's been close.   I think he's very hungry.   He really wants it more than the last couple of years, and I think the way he's been playing up to this event, in the last couple and the last major, the U.S. Open, as well, you can see he's there and he wants to pull it off, and this is going to be one of those.
