 Q.  Three rounds of 69 but that must be the one that's pleased you most, bearing in mind the way conditions have changed today?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  The first days were a little bit iffy.  Got it off the tee well but just didn't get the irons going but took advantage of it.  Still scoring out there which has been great.   
Today the ball-striking was better and gave myself some chances on the back side and that's what you want, especially in conditions like this, and hitting the greens and just taking the stupid mistakes out of it, and I think I did that pretty well today.   
 Q.  Nice eagle on 12?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  Stayed pretty patient.  Maybe one or two mistakes but it was a good round, got to 12 a little between clubs.  Zach said he thinks it's a smooth 6 and I wanted to hit a soft 7, a big 7.  I went with a smooth 6 and managed to get it to three feet and really got it going, from being in a pretty much level par and kind of getting a little bit impatient out there to picking up two, and really getting straight back into the mix was pretty good.   
 Q.  You had a great year here last year and going into Sunday again in contention.  Anything you can take from last year that might help you tomorrow?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Last year I actually played really well.  I think I just made one stupid call on the par 5, 12, trying to hit it out of the burn there.  That was pretty much it.  I played some proper, solid golf, even in the final round.   
Obviously tomorrow, I don't know what the weather has got in store for us, maybe a little bit of rain, things like that.  Just play the same game and try to hit the same shots and just try to copy what I did the last couple days.
