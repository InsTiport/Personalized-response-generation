Q. 30th birthday.  Is there a better way to celebrate the big 30 then tying your career low round?
BRANDEN GRACE: No.  Good birthday present.  It was fun.  Obviously a great day.  Things didn't look too good at the start of the day, people playing out there and things like that.  Couple hours later it was good.
Q. Of course.  What about the similarities, what is it about a setup layout like this that you like?
BRANDEN GRACE: Little bit of imagination, little bit of luck here and there.  You get more luck on the links golf course than maybe on a normal golf course.
Breath of fresh air playing something different this week instead of the week-in, week out.  It was fun.  The tournament did a great job at the venue.  It will only get better with time.
Q. Congratulations, what a great day.  You eagle 14, three 3 birdies, shoot 9-under.  Your thoughts on how you played.
BRANDEN GRACE: It was good.  Obviously all pretty much start off with the bunker shot, birdie on the 1st.  Otherwise you're looking at maybe making a good par off of that start.
Then just played along.  Gave myself some good chances.  But I hit a lot of shots good today which was nice.  I never really had those big birdie putts, big momentum putts you had to make and things like that.  The eagle there, the bunker shot hole-out, it was pretty special.
Q. Your thoughts now four days on this golf course, how do you like it?
BRANDEN GRACE: I love it.  I think, like I just said, it feels like a breathe of fresh air coming to something different.  Really is nice.  I really enjoyed the golf course.  I enjoyed how it played.
Obviously I think we've got really lucky with the weather and that's why the scores were so low.  It can bite you if it settles in a little bit in the next couple years.
Q. 30 years old today, is that right?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yes.  Maybe go for a 60.  It was close enough.
