Q. After Top-10s in Akron and the United States Open, how much is your great play here just a continuation of your great play around the world?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's fun.  Obviously the last couple of events have been great, and coming back to links golf is something I like.  I like playing here and I like the type of golf you have to play around this place.  Got some fond memories here from the past, but hopefully I can go one better this time than the last time.
Q. You move into the Top-10 in the world for the first time in your career this week.  Do you look at yourself any differently because of that achievement?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, a little bit.  I'd like to think that now I don't have to kind of step back for the guys.  I kind of think that I'm getting myself in contention in the big ones and I'm playing some good golf.  I know that the day is going to come where I'm going to click in the majors and then I'm hopefully going to putt my hands on one.
Q. You mentioned going one better to 2013 here; what will it take this weekend to win the Scottish?
BRANDEN GRACE: Patience.  I got a little bit impatient towards the end of my round, just a little bit tired, you lose concentration so quickly.  Just stay patient.  You're going to get some bad bounces; you're going to get some good bounces, and when the birdies come your way, you're going to have to grab them.
