  Q. Nice start, plus 10.  Just a little highlight there at No. 8 with the eagle.  Can you talk us through that first?
 BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, well, it was actually just such a nice -- it set up so nice to my little fade there on that hole, and it's one of those where it's not really one that you have to bump.  If you can just hit it normally you can get it there or thereabouts, and I hit a good one straight at it, came up a little bit short, just in the rough, decent lie, a lot of green to work with.  Hit the perfect chip, came out nicely and managed to roll in, so that was a big bonus.  But other than that, I played really solid.
 Gave maybe two bogeys away there, short missed putt on 16, but otherwise it was very solid.  Just keep the mistakes off, and when it looked like I hit an errant tee shot, I kept the damage to a -1 instead of a -3.
 Q. This is your first trip to the Barracuda Championship.  Just your thoughts on this golf course and coming to this region.
 BRANDEN GRACE:   Oh, I love it so far.  It's just a pity it's always opposite the WGC.  It's such a great place.  I would love to bring my wife and my son out here one day.  It's just so phenomenal.  We like the mountains and things like that, and the golf course is great, I must say.  It's in magnificent condition, and I look forward to the next three days.
 Q. You mentioned it, opposite the WGC.  You're typically in those events.  Struggled a little bit lately and not able to get into that event.  I think you're the highest ranked official world golf ranked player here.  Obviously there's FedExCup points available, and that's the reason you're here I'm imagining?
 BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, a hundred percent.  Like you said, I've actually felt I've played a lot better than actually what the scores are reflecting, but it's one of those where you have to keep on coming, keep on grinding.  You want to see where you can finish at the end of the season, and I'm getting to do just that.  If I can come out here, you never know, play well, get the win or something like that, and then get into next week, which is a big week, and then take it from there.
