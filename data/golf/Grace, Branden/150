   BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was quite tough out there. Could have been a lot better. Made a couple of stupid mistakes. Definitely wasn't playing easy. At the end, the wind and rain came together, and the scores can prove itself for it.   
 I'm quite happy overall for the first two days. In there and in the hunt, so hopefully a good day over the weekend.  
  
  Q. We have been fearing the worst all week, but when you saw some of the scores of the later starters in the morning and the way they were finishing, you must have thought it would be hard work?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I'm surprised because there was a couple of good scores in the morning. Although the wind calmed down for us this afternoon, the golf course isn't that difficult; you can get around.  
 But definitely, it's a very good track out there and it's just so hard.   
  
  Q. Struggling a bit, anyway?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: I've really been hitting the ball well so far in the week, so just finishing off a bit and hopefully in for a good weekend.   
 Been struggling with the feet for the past two weeks, so no pain today and hopefully better for the next couple of weeks.  
  
  Q. How have you combatted the blisters?   
 BRANDEN GRACE: I've ordered the shoes and I received the shoes a couple of weeks back and been practising in Manchester and was not giving me any hassles, but last week in Beijing after the first day, I just became so sore and the blisters were just there.   
 But the physios were there and they have been helping me along for the past two weeks. So hopefully just stay better now, and it's been good for the past two days, so that's been good, touch wood.  
  
  Q. Is it one of those silly things when you have an ache or injury like that, a pain, you concentrate on that and let the game take care of itself?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely, a couple of people told me that this morning; keeps your mind off the game for a bit and concentrate on that for a while.   
 It has been helping, but also the pain is a bit unbearable; yesterday at the beginning of the round it was just unbearable. Fortunately they came out and sorted me out on the golf course and blisters were better from there.   
  
  Q. Blisters aside, are you enjoying life out on the Tour?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's been good. For a first season it's been awesome so far. The guys are great and all of the people around have just been spectacular, it's just been awesome.  
  
  Q. When you reflect on the results and the way things are going, how is that?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: I've had quite a good start to the season back home and all of that. And I took a couple of weeks off, a bit dicey in the beginning, but the form is coming back slowly but at least it's getting better so can't complain.  
  
  Q. Re-rank is the next thing?  
 BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, in my favour having a couple of good weeks coming in now, so hopefully one or two Top 10s should help.  
  
  Q. This is a step in the right direction, because that's a tidy position to be in for the weekend.   
 BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely, and last week also helped to get the confidence up there and lying there at the moment and just looking good for the weekend, so hopefully can get stuck in there.
