Q. Pretty decent day?
BRANDEN GRACE: It was all right.  Obviously I would have enjoyed to be a few better.  I thought I played a lot better than what the end result was.  Yesterday and today I left a few out there.  But probably going to finish outside the top-10 or top-15 or something.
I'm happy.  It's always nice to come back.  It's nice to see the way they do it and it was nice to be a defending champion on such a tournament as this.
Q. Looking like you're trending in the right direction for this season, as well?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  I felt the game was coming along a couple of weeks ago.  And last week was obviously progressing the right way.
And obviously this week I would have enjoyed to be better.  But I still feel there's a lot of positives.  It's one of those that if it just goes your way a couple of times out there, the scores instead of being 3-under it's going to be 6- or 7-under.  So I'm excited and look forward to when that happens.
