Q. Congratulations.  2 and 1 win over Julian Suri, and I thought that stretch, 7, 8, 9, kind of turned around this match?
BRANDEN GRACE: Definitely.
Q. The windy conditions today, how different was it from yesterday?
BRANDEN GRACE: I thought it was pretty similar.  A little bit more gusty today.  Standing on the tee box, like 17, I had to back off once.  But it is tough.  Like I said, it's a great match play golf course.  It's tough to get the balls on the green close.
Q. So tomorrow Julian is playing Bubba Watson.  Bubba won his match today.  I know you're a big Julian fan.
BRANDEN GRACE: I am, indeed.
Q. Talk about tomorrow playing Marc Leishman.
BRANDEN GRACE: I think today was important.  I really needed to get up on the board.  And anything can happen tomorrow.  Julian played some solid golf, but if Bubba does what he did to me yesterday he's going to be a tough one to meet.
But hopefully I can play well and give myself a chance to play well against Mark.
