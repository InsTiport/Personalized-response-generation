Q.   How exciting, excruciating, compelling was it for you inside the ropes?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it was good.   And obviously today I knew I had to win.   I had to pull out all the things out today and managed to get off to a good start and it was nice. 
A lot could have changed.   Zach could have lost and it would be a different story.
But it all worked out and I knew it was going to be a grind after I finished, when I knew the playoffs were going to happen.   You stick with it.   Try to stay with the same momentum, stay patient, and take the opportunities when they came.   And I managed to do so. 

Q.   Was it difficult for you not to look at the scoreboard around as you were playing your match today and seeing obvious scenarios develop as they did?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Big scoreboards out there, you can't really miss them.   So you try to stay away, but your eye just sneaks in there a couple of times. 
I thought it was a lot closer.   We saw Jason and them being all square through 12 holes we thought it was going to be a tight finish to the end.   Our game was really tight as well.   It could have gone either way, I'm fortunate that I made nice decisions towards the end and managed to pull it off.
