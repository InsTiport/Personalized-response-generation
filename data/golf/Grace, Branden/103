Q.   Happy with a round of 66 to start?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it was good.   I really got it going on the front nine.   I was a little bit ‑‑ it was weird, ThorbjÃ¸rn got out of the blocks birdie, birdie, birdie, and Danny and myself just looked at myself just looked at each other thinking, what the hell is going on here.   And then he got it going. 
But we managed to make a couple of nice, good iron shots and hit them close, not manage to make any long putts.   It was a good start and I'm happy with that.

Q.   Are you feeling the benefit of playing last week and obviously finishing 2014 in style?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Exactly.   Obviously it was a dream finish, 2014.   But last week I think was good, and to play out there, the course was really tough. 
This week, coming into this rough, you actually think this rough is pretty easy after last week and you hear the guys like Danny and them saying the rough is thick; if they were there last week, they would have seen thick.
The course is in great shape.   The changes they have made has been great and it gives us all chances with the rough being shorter than usual. 

Q.   You had tight fairways last week.   So you had to really plot your way around and stay out of the rough stuff.   Here you can be a bit more relaxed?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Exactly, if you hit your driver a little bit off‑line, you can still get away with it.   I was not really good off the tee today.   But I kept it in play and I had a lot of misses but the misses were still in the fairway and the ones that I did have in the rough, I managed to get on the green and managed to 2‑putt. 
It's always nice to start the week with a bogey‑free round, so especially in a place like this, that's a big bonus.

Q.   And a place like this is a nice to come to stat the start of the season. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It is.   There's a lot of history, celebrating ten years of great golf with HSBC.   It's great being close to the top of the leaderboard after day one.
