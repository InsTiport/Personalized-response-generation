Q.   What are your thoughts on this wonderful finish but not quite enough? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it was good. I thought I played some superb golf today.   I let a couple slip out there which was unfortunate but it was a good one.   If you told me my first event, start off with a second place, coming this close, I would have taken it.   So I'm very pleased.   Obviously like I said, the winner at the end of the week is going to be the true champion, and he played well, so he deserves it.

Q.   No comfort watching him finish. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was terrible watching it.   You'd rather just go and walk with the guy and see what they are doing coming in. 
It was good, I'm really pleased with the week, with the outcome, so I'll take it, and this is just going to push me in the right direction going forward now.   So it's a good week. 

Q.   I'm only joking but one of these days, you'll start this tournament well, as well as finish it nicely?
BRANDEN GRACE:   True.   It's cost me again this week.   But came a lot closer than I did.   Just unfortunate, it was a couple of ones out there that I let slip.   I had a decent short birdie chance on 12.   13, I let it slip.   14 I let it slip.   15, thought it was good. Now just have to learn through those and learn from your mistakes and things like that and take it on to the next couple.

Q.   And it does bode well when it is the first event of the season. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   This really gives you a push in the right direction, so I'm really stoked with this beginning.
