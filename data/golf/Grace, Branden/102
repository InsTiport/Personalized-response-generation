Q.   Very satisfying start.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was.   It was nice to start the way that I did today.   It was nice to get a couple birdies towards the end on both nines and 5‑under is a good start for the week but a little disappointed with the par 5, 1‑over for the par 5s today. 
The course was not the easiest of the par 5s.   You really have to shit many great shots.   I think maybe one out of the four is reachable, so you really have to be on top of your short stuff there and giving yourself chances.   I didn't manage to do so but the rest of the game was pretty sharp today.

Q.   Not quite as windy as what you sometimes find in Doha but still a challenge. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It is indeed.   I think we were lucky, two weeks in a row now.   Like you said, Monday and yesterday the wind was really blowing, but I think they said it's supposed to pick up this afternoon. 

Q.   Tend to thrive here, don't you. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It's something about the Middle East.   I like playing here.   I think the golf courses really suit me.     It's one of those where you can hit it long off the tee and pretty straight, you give yourself a lot of chances.   I just managed to roll a couple of putts in on these greens.   It's nice to come here and play well.

Q.   We've said this in other events, but you've got that consistency back, you're right at that top of the game almost like the year when you won all those tournaments?
BRANDEN GRACE:   It's feeling good.   Obviously last week was a little disappointing with the second round, but it's nice to get off to a good start again, and hopefully we can do a couple better this week.
