 Q.   9‑under for the tournament, what's your analysis on that performance?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was good, nice to start the way I did, 3‑under for the first nine holes were good and I really wanted to push on the back nine.   I got a little unlucky with a can you couple of putts, missed a 3‑footer on the 10th and I didn't really make anything after that.   Still close to the top and things like that, so still in a good position for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Conditions were pretty perfect, are you a little bit surprised maybe people didn't get to double figures?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, I really thought somebody is going to push.   You saw the guys from this morning, they were 6‑unders and 5‑unders and 7‑unders, and nobody really pushed towards the end of the day.   
You still have to make it.   I think the greens, it wasn't really as quick as I thought they were going to be.   They are still very good.   They didn't spike up at all, so it's a big surprise nobody really pushed on.   
   
 Q.   You're pretty much right where you want to be, top of the leaderboard, what are your thoughts going into the weekends?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, just try to do the same things, hit a bit more fairways would be nice and just make the odd putt, the same as the last few days.   I'm in good position, so just push on from there.   
   
 Q.   I take it there's huge satisfaction once again, isn't there?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it was good.   I got off to the start that I wanted to, got it, I think 3‑under through nine which was nice, and fell a little bit asleep on the back nine.   It was nice.   It's a good way to be at the middle half stage of the tournament, so I'll take it going tied in the lead with two rounds to go.   
   
 Q.   It's a good score come what may but presumably the way you started you thought it might even be lower?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Exactly, you just try to take advantage of some of the short holes on the back side.   If you look at the scores of some of the other guys, the back nine is the 9‑ to score, and I didn't do that today.   Missed a short one 10 and a little bit killed the momentum there.   
I got it going; 4‑under is a good score, and like I said, the top of the leaderboard with two rounds to go, and if I just keep doing the same stuff that I'm doing at the moment, then you never know by the end of the tournament.  
   
 Q.   We've said this throughout the day but these weather conditions are perfect, and yet the course is still challenging; you've still got to work to make a score?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Exactly, this is very odd for this place, even last week, you always get the wind blowing.   The course is in great shape.   It's actually a little bit different to the last couple of years.   Normally it's firm and quick and bouncy.   This year it's a lot different.   
You don't really get a lot of run on the fairways and the greens really sit quite a bit.   It's hard to get into your head saying, attack the flag, if you know that it should bounce.   But the scoring has been good, so I think we are in for a good weekend.  
   
 Q.   Is there any reason why South Africans do well here?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   I don't know, I think it's just we've got the good weather over the Christmas period of time.   We take a break and then we start grinding, and I think when we head into The Desert Swing we are pretty much prepared.   I think that's shown over the last couple years and it's shown again this week.   The guys are really performing.   We are playing well and let's see if we can get a South African winner.  
I'm not hitting the ball as good as I would like to, but I'm getting it around and I'm making a couple of putts which is nice.   Just get a couple more fairways and make a couple of putts and then I ll be happy.
