 Q.   You've had two very good days, a pair of 67s, compare them?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Solid, both of them.   Yesterday was good striking like today.   I missed a couple short ones yesterday but 5‑under I'll take every day.   It's a good start to the week.  
   
 Q.   Are you a guy that likes tournaments that are really low scoring or where par means more?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   I think a little bit of both.   If you can see that you can go low, it helps.   But if you know that you have to protect it and just make your par to go in, it's a different ballgame.   If you can do both, it's the best of both worlds but this golf course is in great shape.   It is low‑scoring and the guys are going deep out there and the weather is playing its part.   I think we are in store for a good weekend.  
   
 Q.   Do you see yourself as a streaky player or a consistent player?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   A little bit more streaky.   I've had a good start to the season but not so good from there.   I feel the form is coming back and if I can keep hitting the ball the way I am and just make a couple of putts, you never know.  
   
 Q.   How would two more 67s suit you?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   I'll take that.   I don't know if it will be good enough but I'm just happy to be in this position and fighting forward.
