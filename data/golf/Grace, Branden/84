Q. Is it a fair final round?  How do you feel?
BRANDEN GRACE: It was good.  Obviously got off to the dream start out there, 4-under through nine, which was needed on a day like today.
But a couple of silly mistakes around the corner.  Disappointing double bogey on the 10 that got me back, too far back, and then it was just a grind coming in.
But a solid third, it's still a great week, and there's still a lot of positives, again, to take out of it.  But it was a good time.  It was a good time this week.
Q. What does this do for you moving forward?
BRANDEN GRACE: Obviously I'm getting closer in the Majors, which I want to do.  I feel that the game is keeping up and the standard of golf that I'm playing is showing.  And I don't have to step down for these guys.
Jason was just a tough competitor this week.  He played some marvelous golf and I don't think anybody would have caught him this week.  But if those silly mistakes weren't in there, you never know what would have been the finish.  But it's still a great week.
Q. Has anything changed in particular in your Major Championship play and the way you approach those events, two Top-5s this year alone?
BRANDEN GRACE: I think you just kind of relax as you go into the weeks now.  I just told Zach as we were walking up 18, it's amazing how these weeks turn out.  My first two rounds of golf weren't spectacular at all and I just grinded away and look where I finished up?  It's still a good week and just grinding and staying patient.
Q. Do you look at maybe the way you start Majors and the way you sort of plan your approach to them, given the way things have panned out in the first three?
BRANDEN GRACE: I think in the past I really did a little bit better practice-wise coming into the Majors, I really played not too many practice rounds and things.  This year after Augusta, it's been a lot more quieter, I've been much more relaxed and I'm just taking it as it comes, really.  Play maybe one, maybe two practice days and just go with it.  And I think that's been a good key.
Q. Are you going to have a word with Charl and Louis after this?  You and George pretty much cleaned them up in the tournament?
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm sure.  They have been the front runners for a long time now after Ernie and it's nice for George and myself just to step it up and showing that this is where we want to play and give ourselves some chances.  So, it's going to be a tough grind now coming in with these guys and they're going to start pushing as well.
