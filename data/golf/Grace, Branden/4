Q. How was the start?
BRANDEN GRACE: It was good. Not the ideal way to start the round, 2-over through 2, and then fought back nicely. Played some solid golf after that and an ideal way to start the event. Especially after coming so close last year, it's nice to come out here and relive some of those moments and get off to a good start.
Q. Great conditions out here, right?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I tell you, listen, it's good now, it was freezing before we teed off, we were on the range warming up, but it's great. It's nice to come back, it's just such a special place, a unique place and the golf course is in immaculate condition, so it's one we all look forward to coming to play.
Q. Is there something that stands out about the conditions to you?
BRANDEN GRACE: It's just not really a lot of wind to go about, but the golf course is not easy, fairways are a little softer I think than last year, but the greens are really firm. So you really have to hit your spots, try to be clever about it out there and give yourself some chances. You can't go at all the pins out there, it's going to backfire eventually and bite you. But on a day like today it's really good, it's nice to get out there before the wind picks up maybe in the afternoon a little, but just take it as it comes, really. But it's nice to start the event the way I did.
Q. At what point do you start thinking about the 16th hole?
BRANDEN GRACE: I would say probably walking to the green on 15. When you get there you start hearing the crowd's going ballistic up there and things like that. And then when you go through the tunnel you know, okay, now it's time, it's time to suck it up and hit a good one. But what a place. You don't get to see this very often, last year was my first one, I really enjoyed it and it's not disappointing again.
