Q. The first question has to be how does it feel to win your first event on the PGA Tour?
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm stoked.  It was a decision to come out full-time at the end of last year.  I wasn't really thinking I'm playing that bad of golf leading up to this event.  The putter has been a little cold.  My first outing here last year was good.  I love this place.  I love the type of golf you need to play here and I managed to do it this week.
Q. Was the turning point on the back nine when you go back-to-back birdies on 12 and 13?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  I knew they were tough holes.  I needed to be aggressive on those two and try to give myself some good chances.  I think the furthest one was probably eight feet.  But made two good strokes, and two big putts for the momentum for the rest of the round.  And then it was just grinding it out the rest of the round.
Q. The way you've been playing did you feel that this breakthrough was just around the corner and potentially this week?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I mean I've been playing well.  I've missed a couple of cuts, but I've been playing great.  Just the putter hasn't been there.  But a week like this it's all about grinding.  There's some courses that suit your eye.  And I'm glad to pull it off this week.
Q. How do you feel about wearing the plaid jacket?
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm excited.  I don't know how it's going to look on me, but I'm excited.
Q. This may have been a little unlikely after Round 2 when you shot 74.  But you caught fire over the weekend.  What went well all weekend, and especially getting off to a hot start?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, just grinding.  This event, it's one of those weeks you have to grind it out.  I was fortunate enough that I stayed patient and took advantage of the opportunities when they came my way.
Q. You've been a top 10 player.  You go to 11th in the World Golf ranking after this victory, but it's your first on the PGA Tour.  What does that mean to you?
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm excited.  Obviously I'm stoked.  I'm very grateful for this opportunity.  I played some good golf.  And this is where I thought I could win out here.
Q. You had opportunities at big tournaments including the U.S. Open.  What does winning here do for you going forward?
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm excited.  This was the next hurdle, to try to get a win under the belt on the PGA Tour.  And now that I have, I know I can win out here.  I'm excited to get to the U.S. Open.
