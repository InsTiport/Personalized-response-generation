 Q.  Opening round 68 today and that equal's your best on this course.  You must be very pleased pleaded?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was good.  I didn't know that to be honest.  I had it going, 6-under through I think 12.  A little bit of slips coming in but it was tough.  The last six holes, the wind was really picking up into our faces there.  So maybe let one slip.  Maybe could have made one but 68 is still a great opening score especially around this place.  You are pretty much playing for the first time around now with the changes.  So happy with the start.   
 Q.  You finished fifth as a rookie in 2012.  Is there almost a rookie feel now because you're having to almost re-learn the greens particularly?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, you could do.  It's hard to predict what the scoring is going to be today.  We know the weather is great, so you would think some guy is going to shoot 8-under or something like that.  But the greens are firm, so you can't always go at every pin.  You have to really try to hit your spots on the green and try to give yourself some chances and actually make a couple of 20-footers.   
But it was tough.  The wind really got up in the afternoon.  So hopefully we can get it going tomorrow.   
 Q.  Only a couple of players have gone around bogey-free so far.  Is that a sign of how tricky this course can be, particularly on that back nine?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  There's some proper shots that you have to hit coming down the stretch.  Your misses can't be -- your misses can't be that big.  So you really have to hit your shots, stick to your routines and try to hit the shots that you want to hit.   
I think that's what I did wrong coming in a little bit.  I didn't commit to the type of shots I wanted to hit 100 per cent and it cost me two bogeys.   
 Q.  But a 68 gives you a good solid place going into tomorrow.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, that's where you want to start.  You want to start the week off well.  If I can get it going again tomorrow, hopefully can be in a good position going into the weekend.
