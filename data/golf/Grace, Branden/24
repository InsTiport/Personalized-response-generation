 Q.  How special is this, winning here at the Nedbank?  
BRANDEN GRACE: This is awesome.  This is the one event that as a South African you want to win.  It's Africa's Major for a reason and what a special place it is.  There's a lot of history and a lot of great winners on the trophy and I'm very glad to be able to put my name on the trophy, as well.   
 Q.  What was the mind-set on the first tee?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I told Zach, if I can get it bogey-free today, we're going to be in there with a chance.  Managed to do that.   
Hit the ball superb and gave myself some chances.  I didn't take all of them, but I did what I needed to do.  It was great to finish the way I did and bogey-free it was and it was great to be able to pull it off.   
 Q.  To shoot 66 on the final day and two great competitors in the final group, as well, must have been a particular challenge.  
BRANDEN GRACE: It was tough.  They played great.  They were quite a bit in front of me, two and three shots starting the day.  On the first, we both hit it to four or five feet and I thought, geez, these guys are keen to get it going.  I knew I needed to stay patient, and I managed to do that.   
 Q.  Latest winner in the Rolex Series, which is a pretty nice thing to have?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, that's awesome.  It's special to win here, firstly, and then special to win one of The Final Series events, as well.  I don't know where it's going to push me for next week, but hopefully I'm in for a shout.
