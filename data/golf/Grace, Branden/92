 Q.  It was a pretty good day?  BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was.  I got off to a flier, and the wind picked up a little bit and it got tougher out there.  But it was mostly concentration.  It got really slower on the back nine, a couple of groups held up there.  So I think that was the cause of two bogeys.  But it was a good, positive day.   Q.  I guess the eagle on 12 was a highlight?  BRANDEN GRACE: It was.  I thought the greens were going to be quicker -- I thought they were going to be quicker than what they were.  I didn't get off to the best of starts.  And I hit it from about 20 feet on the 12th hole.  I just kept hitting good shot after good shot and managed to make a couple of putts, which was nice.   Q.  A lot of people say it was quite linksy.  You feel quite comfortable on links courses, so it kind of plays into your hands, I guess?  BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, but it's a different kind of links.  If you play Carnoustie and those kind of courses, you have to keep the ball on the ground.  If the wind comes up, you have to really hit the flags, really playing your way around the golf course.  I think on this golf course, it gives you a little bit of both.  If you can bomb it off the tee, sometimes you don't have to hit it low, you can fly it 290, 280 off the tee.  You pretty much fly a lot of the trouble.  And most of those long holes, you can cut the corners.  If you do that, you manage to go into the holes with 8- or 9-iron instead of 4- or 3-irons.  It's a big difference.  Obviously putting yourself in position and then trying to make the most of it.
