BRANDEN GRACE: Obviously would have liked to be a lot closer to the top, but so it goes.  I actually played really solid today.  I thought today was one of the better ball-striking days in the week.  Just two bad wedge shots which cost me a couple of shots but so it goes.  You're not going to play on a golf course like this, bogey-free rounds every day but still good.  Still top five, so can't complain about that.   
 Q.  You had your moments, started well in what was a very disrupted week.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's been good.  SA Open was also disrupted but you just have to carry on and say it's golf.  You can't moan; like I said, with a top five you just have to keep grinding, keep believing and just try and move forward.  Obviously fond memories next week, so I'm looking forward to the challenge next week.   
 Q.  Am I right to assume belief is high at the moment because you're on a wonderful run of good finishes?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I've been playing nicely.  A lot of times, you're not playing the type of golf to get those finishes, but I'm just grinding it out and I think that's been the key so far.  But it's been working.  I can't complain.  The putter has been the big thing.  The ball-striking has gotten better every day as the week progressed on, so there's a lot of positives.   
 Q.  You mentioned Doha.  Fond return?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  Obviously lifting the Mother of Pearl last year was great and going back with fond memories and getting a couple of top 5s heading into the week is good.  Confidence there, just need to get over the last hurdle.
