 Q.  2 & 1 win over Julian Suri.  I thought that stretch of 7, 8 and 9, when you won those three holes, kind of turned the momentum in this match.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  I gave him a couple there before 7, which was tough.  It was so windy.  I was trying to keep holes, but it was tough.  It was hard to get birdies out there, as well.   
I think we had a great match.   
 Q.  The windy conditions today, how different was it from yesterday?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I thought it was pretty similar.  Yesterday was blowing.  A little more gusty today, especially standing on a tee box like 17 down there.  I had to back off once.  It's tough.   
Like I say, it's a great match play golf course.  It's tough to get the balls up very close.   
 Q.  You get a much needed point here.  Julian is going to play Bubba Watson.  Bubba won his match today.  I know you are a big Julian fan tomorrow.  
BRANDEN GRACE: I am indeed.   
 Q.  Talk about tomorrow.  You play Marc Leishman?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I think today was important.  I really needed to get the W today and try to put the point on the board.  Anything can happen tomorrow.  Julian played some solid golf.  And if Bubba does what he did to me yesterday, it's going to be a tough one to beat.  Hopefully Julian can go out there and play well and I can give myself a chance with playing against Marc.
