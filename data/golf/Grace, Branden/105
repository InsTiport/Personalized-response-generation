  BRANDEN GRACE:   A pity I fell a little bit asleep there on the back nine but it was a good round still.   I kept hitting the ball well.   The 17th hole was my only bogey today and was the only green I missed today.   
Otherwise I'm very happy and I know‑‑ I didn't know Colsaerts, I thought he was 10 or 11, and now coming in, he's 14.   So four back, so still two days to go.  
   
 Q.   You can still see low scores out there?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   They were very kind to us today with the pins‑‑ not the pins, and the tee boxes.   They moved a whole lot of the tee boxes forward which made it a lot easier for us.   
The tough par 3s they shortened for us which was nice and a couple of the long par 5s, they did it, as well.   With that being the case, then you really need to attack and you really need to try and make the birdies when you can.  
   
 Q.   Probably got lucky with the weather, as well, the rain eased and target golf, not stuff?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   It did.   When I got on to the 10th tee, it looked bad behind us and kept missing us.   Hopefully the sun comes out for the next two days and the course warms up and we can have a good weekend.  
   
 Q.   I've told you're seeing a woman who worked with Ernie?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, I just started working with Sherylle a couple weeks on the go and there's been a big improvement.   Everybody knows I've struggled with my putting a little bit and Ernie said maybe give it a go and see how it works, and I have and it's been good so far.   Just keeping your mind a little bit off the stroke and just doing the rest.  
   
 Q.   Don't want to trade secret but how does it actually work?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   I can't really tell you that much but it's good.   What we've been doing has been working and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far.   
   
 Q.   Excuse the pun, but it was an eye‑opener, wasn't it.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, exactly, it definitely was an eye‑opener.
