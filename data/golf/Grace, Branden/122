Q.   Your thoughts on taking it the distance and then edging through? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   You know, it was tight.   Obviously today wasn't the best ball‑striking day out there.   But you know, just made it easy for him a couple of holes, hitting a ball in the ocean.
But just fought back at the end.   It seemed that he had the 2‑up a couple of times in the round and then I got it back to square and let it slip again.   I thought through 16 coming down all‑square, I thought, you know, I just have to hang in there and a couple of good shots.   I hit one on 17 and you saw the reply there. 
18, unfortunate on his behalf but fortunate to sneak it in there the second time.

Q.   Are you aware of the permutations, knowing what happens if you just square this match and then you're through with the three points, that sort of thing?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, a little bit.   I was kind of in the same situation last year, lost my first game against Thomas BjÃ¶rn and beat the second one with Snedeker and lost in the playoff.   That was a little in the back of my mind but fortunately I started hitting the ball better in the back nine.   A little disappointed with the miss on 17 and managed to sneak one in on 18 that was worthwhile.

Q.   What was the difference today?   Were you just not quite at the races? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   I think you know playing Colsaerts and what kind of match‑play player he is, I have to really be on top of my game.   And today, you can't really say easier match but you have to imagine this is going to happen; and it was one of those things and it was a little wake‑up call when I was 2‑down and I had to work hard to get it back.

Q.   Does it matter who you play next? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   Not really.   Any player on a difficult day is going to be a difficult match.   But if you're on, you're on and take it through from there, but I actually don't even know who is next and things like that so I'll see soon.
