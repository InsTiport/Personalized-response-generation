 Q.   Another day, another win, 5‑up through nine holes, that really courtesy of four birdies in five from the fifth, what was the key?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Just hitting good shots.   I didn't really do anything wrong, same as the first day.   I was fortunate, I got off to a good start again.   Obviously he bogeyed the first, got me to 1‑up, and I had a nice little putt off the green on the second.   
I gave one away on the fourth where he actually drove it in the ocean and took a drop and made an excellent five from nowhere and just relaxed a little bit.   But just one good swing led to another and made a couple of putts.  
   
 Q.   How did the golf course play today?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   The wind was a big factor.   It was really blowing out there.   It was more of a case of just hitting the greens and trying to keep it in play.   When I got the lead going, Zack told me, listen, play from the middle of the greens and take your pars, and he'll obviously make a putt here and there but let him come towards you and make the mistakes and that's pretty much what happened.   The player that he is, you knew he was going to make a comeback, and he made four in a row to get the nerves going a little bit up.   
   
 Q.   Speaking to George Coetzee, he had a message from Gary Player who designed this golf course; did you get the same as the other South Africans?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, he sent me a message, as well, just saying, congratulations on getting here and good luck forward and enjoy the golf course.   I'll I've definitely been enjoying it so far.
