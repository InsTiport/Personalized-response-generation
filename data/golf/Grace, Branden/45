BRANDEN GRACE: I would have liked to be third alone.  Very disappointed with the 3-putt on 18.  But no, I actually hit such eight great tee shot just ended up in the rough and I couldn't even sniff going to the pin and it's a tough 2-putt from the bottom there.  A little bit unlucky, but I wanted to give it a go and try to hit it past the pin and unlucky that I didn't make the.   
Comeback but tied third is my best finish here yet, and hopefully next year I can come back and improve on that.   
 Q.  You're getting closer and closer here, this is the one South Africans want to win.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I am, I am.  Like I said, this is my first one so far.  So hopefully I can come back next year and pip it by a few.   
 Q.  Not quite done for the year, still got a lot of golf to be played.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I'm not just there, had.  I'm going to Dubai next week and then I'm getting married the week after which is nice.  We're very excited for that.  Going down to the Dunhill, as well.  So it's a nice couple of weeks in my life to look forward to.
