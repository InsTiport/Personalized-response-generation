  BRANDEN GRACE:   Got off to a slow start, and you had to be patient out there today.   The golf course was playing pretty nicely, but they've got a couple of pins tucked, especially with the angle of the trees on some of the greens. 
But it was a nice day.   I hit the ball nicely and made a couple of birdies on the back nine, which got me into the mix.

Q.   This course is known as one of the top 10 difficult courses on the PGA Tour.   Is it playing that difficult in your mind out there today?
BRANDEN GRACE:   You know what, I think if the weather changes a little bit and the wind conditions picks up, then it's really going to play tough.   You can see with these last couple of holes anything can happen.   And I think it's happened in the past, where you can have a good lead and you can come up and finish up short for the tournament. 
But we've been lucky so far this week.   But I hear there is some weather coming in for tomorrow.   So it should be an interesting day.   And we'll see how tough it will be.   This place can bite you.

Q.   You're going to be chasing the lead.   Just talk about how big the gap will be.   What's your attitude or mentality heading into tomorrow?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Well, I've been playing well.   Obviously last week I would like to have played better, but the ballâ€‘striking has been the same as this week.   I just managed to make a couple of putts.   I've been very patient the last couple of weeks.   If I can get that mindset for tomorrow, be patient and take the opportunities when they come your way, then we should be there or thereabout.
