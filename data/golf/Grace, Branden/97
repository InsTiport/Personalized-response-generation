 Q. In the win column, interesting matchâ€‘up early.   You had a couple of nice holes on the back nine to close him out?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was a tough game.   When I woke up this morning, I knew it was going to be a tough one.   Obviously he's won this last year, he's done it all.   He's a tough competitor.   I know Jason well from the Presidents Cup.   I know what he's capable of and I know what drives him.   
The main thing today, I got off to a great start.   Starting eagle, birdie is enough tojust scare somebody off a little bit.   Then I just grinded away.   
He made some nice putts towards the turn on 9 and 10, which got him going.   Then I just managed to stay patient and take the opportunities when they came to me.  
   
 Q.   You have got to pull for Charley Hoffman.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Going to be a nerve biting finish by the two of them, so we'll see what happens.
