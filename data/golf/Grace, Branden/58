Q. You played terrific and you putted excellent?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, yeah, it's been good.  I found something on the putting stroke on the first day.  Chris was just a little bit too good for me on the first day.  It was nice.  It's nice to get this golf course and three different kind of winds.
Today is beautiful out here.  It's a spectacular day.  It's nice to play some good golf on a day like this.
Q. You are probably rooting for David Lingmerth, but it looks like Chris is going to win this thing and you guys will be back out there later today.  What are your thoughts on that?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, that's just the way the cookie crumbles, I suppose.  Last year I was fortunate to do the first one and win the next couple and go through in the playoff.  Chris is playing some great golf, so it's going to be a tough one this afternoon.
Q. What do you do to kill the time until this afternoon?
BRANDEN GRACE: Probably have some lunch, do some stretching, start warming up again.  Treat it as another 18 holes.  I think we've got something like three hours to wait.  So we'll take it from there.
