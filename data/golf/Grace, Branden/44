 Q.  Fabulous start to your 2017 Match Play.  4 and 2 victory here, quite dominant.  When did you take advantage of the match?  
BRANDEN GRACE: It's a tough game.  Every game you get out here is going to be a tough one.  You just have to stay patient and keep the bogeys off the scorecard.  I think I did that pretty well.  I actually had a very good last couple of holes.  From 9 onwards, I played really solid.  I think I was 5-under from there on in.  Then you don't really give the other guy any chance to breathe or try to do anything.   
 Q.  Andy Sullivan was coming off his first Ryder Cup, but your Presidents Cup is something to behold.  You went undefeated in Korea.  You've done very nicely in this tournament.  What makes you such a good match player?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I'm a very positive guy in general.  I play an aggressive game of golf.  I hate playing safe and backing off.  I think that's what counts for me being in match play.  Like I say, I had some good things in the past at the Presidents Cup and I've also done reasonably well here.
