Q. What was going through your mind?
BRANDEN GRACE: I knew Pricey put me in the back for kind of a reason, and it was a great game.  I didn't really do anything wrong the first nine, which was good.  And unfortunately for Kuch, he didn't play so good the first nine.  But he stepped it up, I made a couple silly mistakes and really had to show that that one point was secure.  And that just lifts the guys a little bit.  Fortunate that I did enough.
Q. You were undefeated for the week.  How were you able to do that?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, firstly, we played great, myself and Louis.  We had a great couple of days, played some great shots, played some great games.  Just didn't make the mistakes that the other teams did.
Today, again, I knew it was going to be a tough game against Kuch.  He's always the chilled, relaxed guy, and he always comes back sooner or later, and he did that today again.
