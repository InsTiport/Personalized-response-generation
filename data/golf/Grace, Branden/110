 Q.   What's the verdict on round three?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   A little bit iffy at the start.   Came out of the box with two short missed putts, but I kept the ball in play, didn't really make a lot of putts today so definitely going to head over to the putting green soon.   But it was nice, I made one eagle and four birdies.  
   
 Q.   So regrouped nicely and essentially that's a score that puts you in a decent position?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, definitely.   I just kept in my mind the first day, tough conditions, started with bogey.   After my second, I was like, this is it, you can't afford to make anymore mistakes and I just kept missing in the right spots and I had one bad miss, as well, on 16, and I managed a good up‑and‑down to sneak away there.  
   
 Q.   Seems like a course where you have to concentrate all the way, there's no real chance to relax.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   It is.   You get those easy holes but they can bite you as well.   It's just tough because the fairways and stuff are so Bush‑lined.   You really have to trust yourself out there and trust the wind direction and trust the shots, and that's always a lot easier said than done.  
   
 Q.   Any indication of what's necessary?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   You know, a low one, let's put it that way.   I'm not sure, there's a couple of tough holes for the guys to finish at the back there, so you never know what's going to be the situation at the end of the day.   I'll probably be two or three back I suppose, but definitely a nice little 67 tomorrow will be up there.   
   
 Q.   I take it it's nice to have a chance in the first event of the year?   
BRANDEN GRACE:   It is.   It is.   That was the goal for this week.   I wanted to be up there, have the chance to be able to get the win, and that's what I've done.   So I'm just going to head down tomorrow and take it hole‑by‑hole.
