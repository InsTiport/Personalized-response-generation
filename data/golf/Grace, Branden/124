Q.   What went right today?
BRANDEN GRACE:   I think just a little bit more experience.   I learned from the mistakes yesterday, made a couple silly mistakes out there yesterday, but I corrected them today.   You don't have to hit it right at the hole here.   I hit it pretty good, and today that was a big difference.

Q.   Did Freddie give you a little bit of‑‑
BRANDEN GRACE:   He's just a great guy to play with, obviously.   You can see why the crowds love him.   Just what a gentleman, the way he plays golf.   No, he just said there's some shots like Dustin Johnson's where he said there's some ones you just have to take on the chin and go with it.   He tried to get very cute with it on 18.   It cost him‑‑ he could have probably made double at the end but it cost him a double, but it's things like that on this golf course, take it on the chin and move on.

Q.   What was it like playing Augusta for the first time?
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was awesome.   I wouldn't change it for anything.   Obviously I would like to make the weekend to get that little memory a little bit longer, but it was awesome.   The place is exactly what you think it's going to be and more. 

Q.   When did you first think that this could happen, playing at Augusta?
BRANDEN GRACE:   You know, last year after I had my second win.   I shot up the World Ranking and I thought, well, obviously you can't just set your goals on one specific thing, you still have to play and try to win, and that was the case.   If you just play well, it takes care of the rest.
