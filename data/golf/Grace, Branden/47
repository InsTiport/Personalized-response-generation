 Q.  Looked liked you had a decent round out there today?  
BRANDEN GRACE: It was.  It was tough out there again.  It's brutal.  Obviously Louis played some superb golf, getting in with 6-under I think it was.   
I had a solid day.  A couple of ones I left out there, but not a lot of mistakes, which is nice, especially in the wind out there.  Obviously you can get a couple of flyers out of the thick stuff out here but I'm pretty happy with the round.   
 Q.  Mentioned Louis's round.  Did you think a 66 was there?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I think this is a favourable wind, especially on the par 5s, most of the par 5s are downwind.  I think you only have the 10th which is in.  You should get a little bit in front on those holes.   
It's still tough.  You still have to do it.  You still have to hit good shots and finish it off.  The greens are good.  Obviously today, the day got longer with the weather delays, so they got a little bit bumpy towards the end but 6-under par is a great score.   
 Q.  As far as your round is concerned, how many times did you have to back off a shot and maybe re-assess, possibly pull a different club, or did you commit?  
BRANDEN GRACE: No, I committed.  Didn't always help I suppose.  Maybe I should take my time a little bit more tomorrow.   
You have to commit to the shot.  If you don't commit, you're going to hit some way off-line shots out there, and I didn't manage to do some of them today, and hopefully they can stay away over the weekend.
