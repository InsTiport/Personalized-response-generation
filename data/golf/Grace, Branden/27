Q. Thought on your match today, a halve.  What was that match like today for you?
BRANDEN GRACE: It was good. Always knew it was going to be a tough match, but yeah, just a grind, really.  He got off to a good start.  I think he was 3- or 4-under through five holes.  You know, I was on the back foot from the beginning.
But grinded it out towards the end.  Didn't think I hit that bad a shot on the last, but nice to get out with a draw.
Q. You played a guy that's got an unbeaten record in singles.
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, my main goal today was not to give him the 5-0.  That was what I thought, I'm the last one to do it, and I thought to myself, I'm going to try my hardest for him not to do it, and he fell short.
Q. The Internationals closed the gap a little bit today?
BRANDEN GRACE: I've noticed.  I've noticed.  I feel we just need to maybe get together a little bit more often and maybe try and do something that we can get ourselves closer going into the singles.
The last two Presidents Cups, especially in Korea, and this one, we've been so far back but we've picked up massive ground going into the singles.  I think if we can get that gap closer, then we'll be in it.
