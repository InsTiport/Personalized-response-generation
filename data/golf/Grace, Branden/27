 Q.  2-under par today, how would you sum that one up?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, tough.  The first couple holes were really tough and then there was still wind early on in the day.  You know, really started picking up, so you know, was just trying to get -- not making those mistakes out there.   
I actually played really well I thought from tee-to-green.  I had two 3-putts, and it's tough especially if these gusty conditions.  It's so easy to miss a putt or not hit a putt.  It was a good grind and I think I'm in there with a good score today.   
So obviously there's two more rounds to go before the cut and things like that, and hopefully come Sunday being in there with a chance.   
 Q.  Obviously quite unusual wind out there.  How did that change the characteristics?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, normally we have it the opposite way.  The last nine holes coming in is normally tough and then it can be brutal.  Today the back nine was mostly downwind so you can kind of take advantage of it.  But like I said, the pins were on tricky spots, so it was really tough to get it close.  The only way you really actually are going to make birdies is if you hole a 20- or 15-footer, and I just didn't do that today.  I had a few, but I would have been happy with 3-under.  Disappointed not to birdie the last but maybe there's a long one waiting out there.   
 Q.  How do you see the rest of the week?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Coming out here and shooting under par on a tough day like this, you know, gets your hopes up and things like that.  So definitely feel like I'm playing well.  Just try to give myself some chances coming in tomorrow and the next day.
