  Q. A round of 66 today, super score.  What was the secret to it?
 BRANDEN GRACE:   I think getting off the jet lag a little bit, to be honest.  Coming from Mexico it was a nine-hour difference, but I didn't really play well yesterday.  Yesterday the putter kept me in it and today freed it up a little bit, hit the ball better, gave myself some chances and made a few putts, as well.  And nice to finish off -- especially on a tough course like this, finishing three in a row, three of my last four, was key.
 Q. You have plenty of experience around this place.  Do you like that it's set up more challenging this time around?
 BRANDEN GRACE:   It is.  Listen, I thought yesterday the guys are having a few beers maybe before they go out in the morning when you see all these pins.  But it's been tough.  They've really tucked the pins the last couple of days, and almost felt yesterday and today felt like some of the pin placements out there are really tricky.  But the course is still soft so you can still go at some of them, and as you know, around this place, you kind of have to look what the grain does, be aggressive and things like that, so if you get the notes right in your book beforehand, you can take advantage of it.
