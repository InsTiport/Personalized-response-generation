Q. Your thoughts on a lovely position in the end?  I know it's not quite when you wanted but it's been a good week, hasn't it?
BRANDEN GRACE: It's been fun.  Today was good ball-striking.  I think the best so far the whole week.  Managed to make some nice putts.  It was a nice round to enjoy with Charl.  We had a laugh around the golf course and we played really solid.  It's a good round to finish the season, and I think the way it's going at the moment, I should finish third.  It's the best one so far.  So I can't be disappointed with that.
Q. And there were moments today which it really looked like it was going to take off.
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was.  It was close.  A couple of putts I thought I hit good putts but just stayed on the edges.  One putt on 18, I don't know how it went up the hill but just one of those.  I still played solid golf and it was nice to finish the season off like that.
Q. Having played this course over the four days, have you got an appreciation of what those two guys ahead of you are achieving?
BRANDEN GRACE: Definitely.  The type of golf they are playing today, they are just throwing birdies at each other.  But it's good.  The best player on the day is going to win, and I don't know who it's going to be at the moment.  The last two holes are playing tricky, so anything can happen.  I think we are all going to be glued in front of the TV.
Q. This bodes well for your weeks to come?  Doesn't it?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  It's been a good four weeks leading up to this one and now even it feels like I'm going home, two tournaments in South Africa.  But nice to go back and play in front of the home crowds and go to two places I've got fond memories of.  Should be a good two weeks.
