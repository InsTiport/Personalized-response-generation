  BRANDEN GRACE:   We were lucky with the weather, it picked up now a little bit but still fairly easy for links if you can say that but you still have to get it in the right spots and get it around.

Q.   You made it look easy. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It could have been a 59, I told Zach when I hit it stiff on 18, I said, geez, that was close for a 59.   I had some opportunities, but you know, I never really made anything long.   It was all you know, 12‑ to 15‑footers in, which was nice, and it's nice just to have a bogey‑free round on a links. 
I know this is‑‑ you can't really say the easy one out of the three, depending on the days, but it's nice to get in these conditions and you can take advantage of it. 

Q.   You've had some great round on The European Tour this year; where does that rank?
BRANDEN GRACE:   Has to be one of my best.   I won last year back home and the final round, the conditions were tough and it was playing long and I think it was good prep for this week. Unlike last week, the final round there, this was probably the best one of the year. 

Q.   You played here many times before this tournament?
BRANDEN GRACE:   I played here once.   I got invited the last couple‑‑ but I was on The Challenge Tour so I couldn't really get out of the schedule to come here.   I only played nine holes here on Monday, actually, so this is 2 1/2 rounds of full golf on this course, so it was nice. 

Q.   Obviously make a bit of a dip in the middle of the season, to be expected after the sensational start that you had?
BRANDEN GRACE:   I felt like I kept hitting the ball well.   I think I just got a little bit golfed out and like I said at the Bridgestone, it was nice that I came in fourth.   But it was nice, I took a month off now which was nice, went home and spent some time with family and friends and just got amped to play golf again. 
Just really looking forward to the end of the season obviously and getting in the Top‑50 after last week was a big boost, another goal that I can tick off and now new goals are set for the rest of the season.

Q.   Important to go home and recharge the batteries? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   I think so.   I've played a lot of golf this year.   I was one of the guys that played almost the most, I think 22‑ or 23‑odd events, pretty tough which especially with all of the traveling to the States, it got hectic.   That month off was a great thing for me.

Q.   Great to see Anton back?   What a round for him, as well. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   It is, definitely.   I know he's changed things around I've heard and I know he's been working‑‑ he's been working really hard on his golf and he's had a win in the States a couple of weeks ago, so nice to see him coming back and performing the way he is.

Q.   And he said what you've done this year has inspired him as well?   
BRANDEN GRACE:     We are good mates a couple of years ago when he achieved what he did, I was looking up to him so it was nice to return the favour.
