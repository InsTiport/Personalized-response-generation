  BRANDEN GRACE:   Well, definitely, I'm feeling good, feeling great, it's nice to play at Fancourt in front of a home crowd.   I'm hitting the ball well which is always good and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season. 
I didn't really give myself many long chances out there.   Missed a couple of short ones but I kept hitting the ball well and giving myself chances around the corner there. 

Q.   5‑under, did you expect to be four shots behind the leaders? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   Not really.   It will be nice to see how I can follow it up.   He's one of those guys that hits it a mile and comes off really close.   But you know the scoring is out there. 

Q.   You played with Ollie this morning, obviously you can hit it further than him, but do you sort of learn from anything playing with a legend of the game?
BRANDEN GRACE:   You know, I really enjoyed playing with him.   You can just see by the way he handles himself around the golf course and takes care of business.   I think that's the way to do it.   It was awesome playing with him. 

Q.   You hit good shots quite a few times‑‑
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, he kept saying‑‑ (Inaudible.) I think that's the way it should be and that's the way the game should be played.   It was nice to get off to a good start and to play with somebody like that. 

Q.   How have you been feeling coming off your best European Tour win last week?   Has it been a difficult week in terms of getting focused? 
BRANDEN GRACE:   (Inaudible.)   Thinking about the next couple of weeks ahead, but it's been great so far.   I think the concentration is still there, obviously tired after a long week but one of those things that you have to deal with.   I know there's a couple of long weeks ahead so just keep your head down and keep grinding and try to run where it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BRANDEN GRACE:   First hole I hit a rescue down the middle of the fairway.   I actually went a little bit further than I wanted to.   Managed to hit a gap wedge into about four feet and managed to roll that putt in. 
The eagle at the 9th, hit it straight down the fairway and left myself‑‑ going in, I think it was 277 yards and managed to hit a great 3‑wood.   One of those greens where you have to be on the right side of the hole and one of the hardest chips, but any chip that you hole is a good chip.   So managed to chip it in from there and that really kick started it from there. 
On 10, hit a driver down the middle of the fairway and got it down to 66 yards out and managed to hit a nice lob‑wedge and kicked it up there for about four feet and managed to roll that in again. 
On 11, I had 156 yards straight and I thought I'll just hit a full 9‑iron.   Hit a 9‑iron to about six‑foot just below left of the hole and managed to roll that in again. 
The birdie on the par5, I spun out a drive on the right and actually got lucky, got a leap off the path and managed to get a nice lie in the rough and hit it to just short of the green and managed to chip it pretty close from there, three‑foot, and tapped that in. 
It was a bit of a quiet streak from there.   18 is just one of those where you want to hit the fairway.   Managed to do that.   I was actually very good off the tee today, so I kept giving myself opportunities. 
And then I had‑‑ not sure about the distance, but I hit a good rescue.   I just missed it a section, which obviously didn't get all the way up there, so wasn't up to the front of the green and rolled down and I left it on a good spot but I managed to have quite a straightforward chip there which I actually almost holed and finished behind the pin so that was good.
