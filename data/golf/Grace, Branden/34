 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Not at all.  Still tough out there.  Being in the mix in a major is always tough.  It's never easy.  And the weather never made it that easy where it's going to be a birdie-fest out there.  Yesterday was calm conditions.  I took advantage of it today.  I thought a couple under was going to be a good shot.  And like Rory said, hopefully towards the end it gets tough where the guys in the lead come back towards us.   
Those guys are playing some great golf.  And they were never going to buckle under the pressure coming in or so far they haven't.   
I'm happy with the finish.  If you told me after making the cut, you're going to finish tied 6th I would have taken it.  But then again with being in the history books.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely, I thought if I can go out and get a quick start, maybe post a number of 4- or 5-under, 9-under is never going to be out of it really.  If you look at the guys now, the last time I looked they were both 8-under.  So that would have been in the mix.  If you post that number two or three groups before the leaders, then the nerves kick in a little bit.   
And I'm stoked.  Like I said, it's the best major finish I've had at an Open Championship.  So for me there's a lot of positives to take from this week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, yeah.  It's awesome.  I must say, my wife told me this morning, just -- the week's already been such a bonus.  Obviously being in the history books.  Now I can go out and enjoy today, whether it goes good or bad.   
Today was just a bonus day, really.  And I'm looking forward to the next one, really.  So now I know I've got that low one in me, especially in these big, big events and I'm looking forward to the PGA.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I love it.  I've had two years in a row I think top 4's, which has been great.  And I've not been to the venue this year.  I hear it's long, it's tough.  It might be a drawer's golf course.  But I think I'm the type of guy that I grind it away.  I can grind the score out there.  It showed again -- today went the best but I grinded it out.  I played a great clutch birdie on 17 when it was looking like bogey at least.   
But I'm excited.  I've had two top-5's in the last years, so I'm going in with good momentum.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I'll see that week.  We've got the Bridgestone in a couple of weeks.  But I haven't had time to head over beforehand.  I might maybe do next week.  But it's been a long couple of weeks, and I've got some sponsor obligations the next couple of days.  So I'll take it as it comes.   
It's never a bad thing pitching up there on the week and not over-preparing.  Sometimes you get to a golf course and you know a little less than what you should and that might help you, not knowing that there's a hazard or some danger around the corner.  So it might work out.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yes, I did, yeah.  He just said, hey, you broke my record (laughing).  I didn't at that stage know who it was.  But it was nice.  It's awesome.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: I've got no idea.  I've got no idea.  Yesterday was such a roller coaster.  I've been trying to put the phone down as much as I can.  But it's been pretty much impossible.  Now when I get on the plane tomorrow night or on Tuesday I'll pretty much have some time to read up a little bit more on the history and that type of stuff.  I have actually looked at the great names that shot 63 before, but obviously not on the course record.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDEN GRACE: I have, yeah.  -- I don't know, they were sitting there -- they were sitting watching the rugby and switched to the golf.  They were contemplating whether the putt was inside left or straight.  And you hear them on the video, when I made the putt they were all screaming.  It's nice to get a message from Louis and from Charl, and obviously like Louis said, that's something nobody can ever take away from you.
