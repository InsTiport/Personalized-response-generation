Q. You really had it swinging good.
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, swinging nicely.  Obviously a little bit disappointed.  I think there was one slip with the short putter where I should have gone 3-up.  But played really solid.  It's one of those days where you almost have to play the man.  It's windy, it's tricky.  You have to hit some good shots.  And sometimes a par is enough.  And I did that pretty well today.
Q. Do you like match play?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, I do.  I think it showed a little bit in the past.  But it also depends what you get on the day.  I actually was talking to my wife this morning, last year I lost in my first round.  Bubba was 7-under through nine holes and then you're running into a rock wall.  But you have to grind it out and play.  I grew up playing a lot of this match play format and things like that, and I really enjoy it.
Q. Branden, you played very, very well.  You played well in the Presidents Cup.  You love this format.  You told me earlier you grew up playing this.  What is it about this that gets your juices flowing?
BRANDEN GRACE: The Presidents Cup is a little bit different, because you have the whole team behind you.  There's nothing like it.  But it's all go.  You have to trust yourself.  You have to go after shots and things like that.  When it's tricky and like windy today, it kind of takes you away from playing the golf course.  You have to kind of play the man a little bit.  Because he can hit it in the water and you play a little bit on the safe side and things like that, where it kind of moves away from a normal game plan.
I enjoy it.  I think you just have to really back yourself and see how many holes you can win.
Q. In this format with the three-day pool play, that first win puts you in good position for tomorrow.  If you put your foot on the gas and win, you're really in great shape.  How does a win today affect how you go about business tomorrow?
BRANDEN GRACE: The same thing.  I mean, obviously tomorrow is going to be a tough match - I'm playing Dustin tomorrow.  It's going to be good.  You know, if I keep doing the same things that I've done today, ball-striking was a big key.  I'll head to the putting green.  I missed one or two little short ones.  So if I can get that under control, I'll be there.
