 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was good.  Obviously David is a tough competitor and is a great player in the wind.  I think no bogeys on the scorecard on my behalf was maybe key.  I think that was good especially around this track.  Different wind than we had the whole week.  Good ball striking and I'll take that.   
 Q.  It's no team event, but you are playing for your bracket.  You have a pretty good record in some of these team events.  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  It's fun.  I'm trying to live a little in those moments.  The guys behind you is pulling you along.  But so good, so far.  It all depends what happens behind me.  I'm still in there with a chance.   
 Q.  Have you been paying attention to your bracket and what's going on?  
BRANDEN GRACE: I have been a little bit.  Obviously it's touch and go at the moment.  Hopefully things go my way and I have a chance to do it tomorrow.
