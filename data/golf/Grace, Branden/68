BRANDEN GRACE: Got off to a nice start, obviously made some mistakes coming but that's just how it goes.  Had a couple longer chances which wasn't ideal.  You try to get them close or still give yourself a chance.  Two putts was a lot quicker than what I thought but didn't manage to do it.   
Played great and still had a good week and had a lot of positives heading into the next couple.   
 Q.  I take it you were very positive at the start of play today, as well, and when you made those birdies, everything was possible?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was.  Just the momentum turned there at I think it was the 12th, the par 3, just hit the wrong club and made bogey.  And that was it.  That was costly.  Got it back, missed a couple of short opportunities after that, I think at 13 and 14, and then just those two or 3-putts coming in.   
 Q.  Important to finish as you did?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  I told Zach, he said, you're going to be disappointed, it's been a good week, just finish with one good putt and I managed to do that.   
 Q.  Bigger picture is nice in terms of rankings.  
BRANDEN GRACE: There's a lot of positives.  Obviously it's not the W but it's right up there and still in good form heading into next week.  Hopefully can be similar.
