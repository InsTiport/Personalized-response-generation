Q. How did you get it done today?
BRANDEN GRACE: Just ball-striking was pretty much the big key.  I've always enjoyed playing in the wind.  Today was tough, man.  It's gusting out there at the moment.
Just trying to pick the spots and trying to hit the right shots, trying to give myself chances.  I didn't get greedy at all and when I had the chances, I took them but I left a few out there, which was surprising, but I'm happy.
Q. You received support from your drop on Thursday and also criticism from your drop.  Has that been motivating for you at all this week?
BRANDEN GRACE: To be quite honest, I don't think I did anything wrong.  I played within the rules.  The rules official is there for a reason, and it was a valid question and he gave me the drop.  I actually heard that Harrington was in the same scenario yesterday and he got relief, as well.
So you know, I think it is something that brought the attention to a lot of guys out there that maybe didn't know about that rule but now they know.  Like you say, some guys are going to love it and some guys are going to hate it.  That's always the game.  Like I said, I can only ask the question if he gave me relief, and he did.
Q. You've won four golf tournaments on The European Tour back in 2012 and really launched you on to the global stage.  Why is winning this golf tournament, therefore, so important to you?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, BMW has been kind to me in the past and they are a great sponsor to myself, as well, and to The European Tour down here.  It's just one of those events that I grew up watching.  There's some great names on the trophy and I would like to be part of that history.
Q. That was a bit of a battle on the front nine, but you managed to string a fantastic run together as you started the back nine?
BRANDEN GRACE: It was tough, man, I tell you, you just kind of are trying for pars.  I managed to make a few birdies but there was a couple of bogeys that creeped in.  When I got around the corner, it was good.  Ball-striking is pretty good the whole day.  Missed a few but I made a few nice ones there, as well.  Pretty much cancelled it out but it's tough, man.  It's just such a grind out there.
Q. Saturday is normally known as moving day and today was maybe a case of not going to the wrong direction?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it was pretty much try to stay alive out there.  It was fun.  It's a tough day and you really had to play well to shoot a decent or a good number out there today.  So I'm happy with the way I played, and I'm happy with being in there with a chance tomorrow.
Q. One shot off the lead and it promises to be a fantastic final day.  If the wind drops, there's some good scoring out there still?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, definitely.  Just depends obviously what they are going to do with the greens.  It is playing pretty firm at the moment.  I think they might have softened it a little bit because of the conditions.  But I've not looked at the forecast but if it's anything like today, I think it's going to play very similar, tough and hard.  The guy that wins at the end of the day is going to be the one that shot a number and grinded the best.
Q. If you were to win tomorrow, where would this rank for you?  It's a big event?
BRANDEN GRACE: Oh, yeah, one of my biggest ones I probably have won then.  Like I said, it's one of those events that as a junior and amateur, and even as a pro, this is one that you always watched as the main Flagship Event for us here in Europe, and it would be great to be part of that history.
