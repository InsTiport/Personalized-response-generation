  BRANDEN GRACE:   That was good.   That was probably the day I hit the ball the best.   Just didn't make a putt.   I had four 3‑putts today which was the downfall, and just wasn't really any hard putts to be honest.   Just 3‑ or 4‑footers, straightforward putts that didn't go in.   If those had went in, it would be a different story.  
   
 Q.   Frustrating or do you console yourself that you're still in the mix?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   It's going to be hard to catch Luke.   He played world class today.   He's putting‑‑ the way he putted today was remarkable.   Everything he looked at, he made it.   That's why he's No.2 in the world.  
The way he's playing, he's hard to beat but you can still have a good week and good finish.  
   
 Q.   He's gone a hundred holes without a bogey here.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   I know, that was the plan for me this week.   But only three or four putts the whole week and today, five 3‑putts for the week, so it's one of those things, but I'm still in with a good chance.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts, any kind of target in mind?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Just to go as low as possible.   I think the way they have put the course up and things like that, there is low scores out there, and I think the guys are slowing it.   It was just one of those days where if a couple of things don't go your way, you're not going to score low.   
Luke, it was 6‑under for him today.   You know, it's out there and he didn't really do anything special, he kept it, as always, simple and he made it.   
I think there's a low one out there, the same as the second round, but I just have to make a couple of putts.
