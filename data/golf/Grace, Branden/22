Q. Level par, 8-under today, what happened?
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, yesterday was a struggle off the tee really.  I found something a little bit in my swing I think through seven holes today and I thought I was standing a little bit too far away from the ball and just kept it in play.  I told Zach halfway through, if I can just get in the fairways I can be aggressive and that's what I did in the back nine.
Q. Coming into the event, so many players are debuting for their season and you played last week, second place.  How nice is it coming into The Desert Swing with tournament rounds under your belt?
BRANDEN GRACE: It's awesome.  For us it's nice to start back in South Africa and kind of almost feels easier with the home fans there as well and courses you're familiar with and things like that.  I enjoy starting that way, and then I feel when I come into the Middle East, I feel like I'm ready to go.
I've always played pretty decent this stretch on, so I'm really excited.  Yesterday was a little bit of an iffy round but played myself right back into it today and hopefully I can keep it going for the weekend.
