 Q.  Yesterday I asked you, how would you describe the way you guys played on day two; how would you do that on three?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: We played solid again.  There was a few holes where we made two bogeys around 5 and 6.  I had a few poor iron shots, but I putted well on the holes that I didn't hit the greens.   
Branden's always going to cheer you up and is always keeping you nice and positive.  It's been good.  We've been really a good team this week.   
 Q.  How would you measure your confidence right now?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's great.  I think it grows every day the better we play.  There was a couple of slips towards the middle there but we got it going.  We made a good birdie there on 9 again that was the key, and then we just keep going with it.   
Like Louis said, I'm a very positive guy, I like cheering him up.  I'll give him a smile every now and then.  Just try to get the mood up, and we've been playing nicely and hopefully we can have a good one this afternoon.
