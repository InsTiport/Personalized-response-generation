 Q.   Not a bad start for the team as a whole?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, I still thought we played good‑‑ we didn't play great.   Our putters let us down and they just killed us on the green today.   It's a good result for the team only being one point back.   3 1/2 ‑ 2 1/2 is not as good as we wanted but it's a good start.  
   
 Q.   After the rain delay, seems like you got a little momentum.   
BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, we did, but like I said, the putting just killed us today.   I missed a 4‑footer on 11 to halve, otherwise it would have been 2‑down and then we both missed three footers on 14.   Otherwise we would have been 2‑down with a couple to play and then it's game on, it's just one of those things.   There's always tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Greens a little slow?  
BRANDEN GRACE:   Just didn't lip in.   We hit a lot of putts that lipped‑out; they hit a lot of putts that lipped in.   It's just one of those things, one of those days, but that's how it goes.
