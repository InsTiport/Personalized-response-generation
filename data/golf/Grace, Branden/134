Q.   Great finish to another great day for you.
BRANDEN GRACE:   It was.   I didn't really play particularly well.   I got it around.   Loose shots here and there but this course mentally does it to you.   You expect to hit a couple of bad shots out there but I kept fighting. 
I was a little bit unlucky on 15 making that double‑bogey.   I told Zach, I pushed the ball forward which I shouldn't have.   I should have taken the five and run, and got a little bit clever with the putt there and raced it by and just hit a bad shot coming back.   Finishing the birdie like that in style on this hole was a great finish to the day.
I actually hit a soft little gap wedge in there‑‑ I was actually nervous playing that hole every day so far and just thinking about the hole makes me nervous.   Finishing on birdie is a bonus. 

Q.   They often say this is the toughest of the three courses but playing as well as you are, guess it doesn't really matter too much where you play?
BRANDEN GRACE:   The thing is, I think this course, it just hits you mentally.   Everybody knows the name, everybody calls it Carnasty.   The name says it all and things like that, and it is for me a lot tougher than all the rest.   But obviously when you are playing well and things like that, everything goes your way and you forget about those things that gets tough and you turn it around to something a little bit more easier.   
But you know, it still showed that you still have to hit good shots, and the one bad shot that I hit, the one that I missed into the fairway bunker, my only bunker of the week so far, I made a double which cost me.   So the errors, you need to keep the errors off the card.

Q.   Another run of birdies, three in a row. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   I actually made a good save on 10, which was a bonus.   When I made that save, I thought the putter just showed that it was there again.   And then I hit a good 2‑putt.   I hit a par putt about 20 foot.   I hit it long over the green and I was actually dead.   So I hit it to about 20‑foot and then made the good putt from there. 
Then on the par5s, just hit the green in two.   Managed to 2‑putt and then I hit a good shot on the par3 to about five, six feet and managed to roll that and in the same on the next par 5.   I hit the fairway, I hit a good 6‑iron to the middle of the green and managed to 2‑putt, so that was the three in a row. 

Q.   You made some good saves also on the front nine and at 16; you said it's also about making saves as well as birdies. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   Definitely.   I think my putter's definitely showed the better sides of myself lately.   I think the putter has definitely been hot this week and to make those come‑back putts is definitely something that gets the confidence going. 
It's been the same the last two days.   So hopefully it just stays the same tomorrow. 

Q.   You've shown you quite enjoy front‑running. 
BRANDEN GRACE:   I think the way I'm playing, you never know what's going to happen on the day.   I think if I keep hitting the ball like I am and make the putts like I am around the turn, then anything is possible and just hope for the best. 
ThorbjÃ¸rn is one hell of a player and he's shown in the past that he can play with the big names as well and he's not going to fall under pressure and things like that.   Everything depends on the weather.   If we have a great day tomorrow, it's going to be a low‑scoring round, and if the weather turns bad on us and the wind starts blowing, you'll never know what St. Andrews has got for us. 
I've dreamt of picking any trophy up on that bridge on the 18th, so maybe this time tomorrow, it happens.
