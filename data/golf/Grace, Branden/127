  BRANDEN GRACE:   The whole week, I've been struggling on the greens.   The score could have been better than what it is but I'm heading in the right direction, so I can't complain.   The ballâ€‘striking as the week has progressed has gotten better and that's a good positive.  
   
 Q.   And you're heading in the right direction a day earlier than you've done the last two tournaments.   
    BRANDEN GRACE:   That's true, it's all about tomorrow, you never know what's going to happen.   I think the guys up in front are pushing away a little bit.   But there's some tough holes coming up with this wind; but you never know, a good Sunday can mean a lot of things.   
   
 Q.   Presumably with Durban, Abu Dhabi and now here, the game is in a good place, isn't it?  
    BRANDEN GRACE:   Yeah, it is, it's feeling good.   I must say, I've got all new equipment in the bag from Durban onwards, new bag, driver, everything.   At first it's a little bit of getting used to, but at the moment I'm feeling very comfortable out there and I'm starting to hit shots that I'm seeing out there which is a good thing.   Hopefully the tomorrow the putter just warms up a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Clearly that was all the talk in Abu Dhabi about putting new equipment in the bag; how easy is it to get used to things?   
    BRANDEN GRACE:   These days, the guys out there, they do such a great job preparing the clubs for all the players.   I think if you do something, maybe in Rory's case, changing from Titleist to Nike, might be a big thing but for us, staying in the same equipment.   
    Callaway don't really change their things that much.   It just gets a little bit better, but still stays the same shapes and things like that, so that helps in a big way.
