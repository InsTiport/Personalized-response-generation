Q. So run me through the double eagle at the last?
RHEIN GIBSON: Well, I hadn't had a birdie all day and just leaking oil, hitting good shots, not doing anything.
I hit an unbelievable tee shot there, and had a wedge in from -- what were we -- 140?  175 yards.
Q. How far did the drive go?
RHEIN GIBSON: It went a long way.  But I hadn't done anything all day.  I thought if I could have a chance, maybe a five-pointer, try to hit a wedge in close, and landed good and the second letter disappeared.
Q. You saw it go in and everything?
RHEIN GIBSON: Saw it go in.  The crowd went pretty bonkers.  What a way to lift my spirits because it was a battle today.
Q. How many double eagles in your life?
RHEIN GIBSON: Second.  That's the first one in a tournament.
Q. When was the first one?
RHEIN GIBSON: Probably three years ago.
Q. How far was that?
RHEIN GIBSON: Driver 8-iron.
Q. What's it like to be able to give 100,000 to a charity in your name?
RHEIN GIBSON: That's pretty cool.  Obviously wasn't thinking that in the fairway.  But what a nice perk.  Thanks pretty cool.  Thanks to Barracuda for doing that.
