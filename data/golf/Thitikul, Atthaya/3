 Q.  Great round, four birdies and an eagle today.  Tell us about that.  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: My shot today, it's very good, and my feeling, it's very good.  Everything's there, it's so good.  I'm so happy on the golf course.   
 Q.  How was this whole experience from last week, winning the WAP, to this week, the HSBC Women's World Championship, how has the whole experience been for you?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Experience for last week, the hole locations, the slopes, the greens, everything, I have more confidence from last week.   
 Q.  What was it like playing among professionals this week?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Good.  So excited and everyone was good.  Everyone teached me a lot.   
 Q.  Have you made improvements across the various rounds?  I think you started the first day with double-bogey and second day a bogey.  Yesterday was bogey-free and four birdies and today, you even made eagle.  Was there any strategy or plan coming into this?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Keep smiling and have fun on the golf course, and focus on your games.  Don't worry about birdie.  Don't worry about the hole.  Focus on the game.  It's only the clubs and the ball and the golf course and you.   
 Q.  Can you give us one lesson you've learned this week from somebody?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Lesson, thinking of people.  Thinking of what are you thinking to hit, the area that's very safe for you.   
 Q.  I saw you on the tee box on hole No. 7, and while waiting to hit on the green, you are talking with your caddie and laughing.  Is she sharing another joke, as well?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Yeah, yeah, a lot.  It's not golf at all.   
 Q.  So does that help, laughing?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: It helps a lot, yeah.   
 Q.  You just looked so confident out there.  Were you feeling nervous inside?  Because you didn't look nervous at all.  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: No, just have fun and keep smiling on the golf course and not nervous at all.   
 Q.  When you played in the World Juniors, was that in Florida or in San Diego?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Yeah, San Diego.   
 Q.  So you're going to go back and play in a major, the ANA Inspiration, and the British Women's Open.  So how does this performance this week help you to play even better at the major?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Have more confidence in and every shot is better than last year and helps.  RICOH and ANA will be good, and will be better than last year.   
 Q.  I'm curious, what is the meaning of your name, actually, Atthaya.  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: It's smart, yeah.   
 Q.  So you're going to bring your caddie back to the major?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: No.  I don't think so.  A lot of money to bring there.   
 Q.  How did your experience playing on the Ladies European Tour help you last year help you with sort of just dealing with the pressure this week?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Experience there, it's a lot.  It teach me a lot and it's giving me more confidence, and lots of positive thinking to take from that.
