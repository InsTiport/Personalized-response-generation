 Q.  Well done today on your round.  So no bogeys, nothing.  Just four birdies, right?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Yeah, four birdies.   
 Q.  So what do you make of your round today?  How do you feel?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Pretty good start.  A lot of times made bogey but I can make par and it's really good, and my driving isn't good but other things are good and I'm happy with my results.   
 Q.  What was it like playing with Angela Stanford?  I looked at their scores and they had bogeys and all that.  How was it?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: It's not really bad for her, but she's a good person and her putter, it's still good.   
 Q.  So what do you learn?  Did you learn anything from the two of them?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Read the greens.  Read the greens, read the line and the putter, yeah.   
 Q.  Your caddie is kind of experienced and helped you to win the LET event last year.  But how could you find it?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: My sponsor, I saw him.   
 Q.  So you're not just expecting him to help you out?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Yeah, he helped me a lot.  He has a lot of experience for it.  He's carried for Nicolas Colsaerts and has a lot of experience for him.   
 Q.  I saw you on your first round, you out-drive even your playing partners.  What is your secret to have such power?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: I didn't have secrets.  I didn't have secret.   
 Q.  Seriously, practice a lot?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: No.  I think it's not really special talent.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, any expectations or anything?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: No, just same plans and keep going and keep smiling on the golf course and happy everything will happen.   
 Q.  I bet you're quite happy right now, 7-under and bogey-free?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Yeah.
