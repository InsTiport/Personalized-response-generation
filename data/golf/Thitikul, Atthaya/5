 Q.  1-under for today, so how was your round today?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: It's not really bad and it's not really good, also.  My driver, when I start, it's not really good, and my irons are good, but my putter is not really good.  But I came back for 1-over.   
 Q.  You played today with Moriya, your fellow Thai.  How was that like?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Moriya was good, a friendly girl.  My big sister always, she talks with me a lot and I think she's really good.   
 Q.  Did she give you any advice during the round itself?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: A bit but not much.  We talk together about everything that's not golf.  We talk about a lot of things but not golf.   
 Q.  So do you do your singing of songs?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: A bit.  She understands, but she didn't sing together.   
 Q.  What's your plan heading into the next final two rounds?  
ATTHAYA THITIKUL: Just same plans.  Hit fairways, greens in regulation and two-putt, and when you can make it, you need to make it.  All planned and happy with whatever happens on the golf course.
