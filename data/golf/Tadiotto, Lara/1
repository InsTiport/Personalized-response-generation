LARA TADIOTTO:  Well, the day was already long because I woke up at 3:00.  I couldn't sleep anymore.  I think it was jet lag from the flight from Europe.  I just arrived on Wednesday.

Q.  What would that mean to you and your career if you were to (indiscernible)?
LARA TADIOTTO:  It would mean a lot.  It's my dream since    11 years, I guess.  It's a part of playing golf.  I started late.

Q.  You said you sold your house.  Where did you sell your house?
LARA TADIOTTO:  In Belgium.
Q.  Will you go back?

But if I make it, then I can find a place in the States where the weather is good.  It all depends on this year where I'm going to live next year.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks very much.
LARA TADIOTTO:  Thank you.
