 Q.   You were even through five holes, and then talk about what happened after that.   
ANDRES ROMERO:   Well, I started to hit the ball bad.   The 1st and 2nd hole I was not feeling very good.   I thought my swing wasn't there, and after the second shot on 15, I found the water, and then from there I had troubles all the time.   I tried to do my best, but my swing wasn't there.  
   
 Q.   Was there something physically wrong with you?   
ANDRES ROMERO:   It was just a mental problem, not physical.   You know, my swing wasn't there, and I couldn't make any putts.   That's the reason, the main reason.   
   
 Q.   How frustrating is it playing so well yesterday and struggling the way you did today?   
ANDRES ROMERO:   I cannot find the reason.   It's a 20‑stroke difference between one day and the other, and I cannot find any response.   
   
 Q.   The 6th hole, can you talk about the 6th hole?   
ANDRES ROMERO:   On the 6th hole I hit 3‑wood to the middle of the fairway, and then I had 130 yards to the flag, and I hit the ball very bad.   Then all of a sudden‑‑  
   
 Q.   You went in the water twice?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   Twice, yeah.
