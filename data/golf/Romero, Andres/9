 Q.   By three shots, and you're somehow one off the lead.   It's kind of a funny day out there, but a spectacular round.  
ANDRES ROMERO:   Well, after New York I didn't play any tournament, and I was practicing a lot and working on my game.   And I was feeling very good this week.   My swing is there.   I was hitting the ball well, and I had a really good round today.  
I thought I was going to finish leader, but Henry did one more birdie.   But I'm feeling good.  
   
 Q.   You seem very loose out there.   You seem very comfortable.   At some point after 15 did you start thinking about what you could possibly shoot, even a lower number?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   Not really.   I was focused on my game and I was trying to do my job, and that's all.   I feel very good and focused on the game and every shot.   So I wasn't paying attention to the leaderboard and the other guys.  
   
 Q.   What do you take from this round into tomorrow?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   Everything.   (Laughs).   Tomorrow it's a different day, but I will try to do the same thing.   
   
 Q.   Great playing.
