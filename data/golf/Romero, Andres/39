Q. How do you feel about playing in the Open?
ANDRES ROMERO:  It's a dream come true.
Q. Were you thinking about winning today or the Open place?
ANDRES ROMERO:  I was trying to win this tournament. I went for the pin on 18 and came up short and made bogey. I would rather have won here because that would have got me into The Open but I am delighted to be in The Open.
Q. Do you have any expectations for next week?
ANDRES ROMERO: I am going there hoping to play all four rounds and enjoy it. It will be wonderful.
Q. Will you have to cancel a flight home now?
ANDRES ROMERO:  Yes - I was meant to go home but will be staying here for another two weeks.
Q. The last man to win The Open at Hoylake was an Argentinean - can you repeat that?
ANDRES ROMERO: Maybe. I am playing very well and I'm hoping to continue that - we will just have to wait and see.
