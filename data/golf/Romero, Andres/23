  Q. Talk about you seemed really nice and consistent there, especially in your front nine. Just talk about your play as a whole today.   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I hit great shots during the whole round. I think I hit all the greens, and that's important. And then I made some interesting putts.   
 I wasn't that sure with my game, but finally with those putters, we went in in the first nine, give me confidence.   
  
  Q. You had a good tournament three tournaments ago and missed a cut the last two. What went wrong the last two tournaments?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I don't know. I really have a lot of ups and downs. I would like to play really good this tournament because I want a good tournament again.   
 I would try to have more regularity in my game. I think it's just the first step.   
  
  Q. Talk about the putting and the greens. Were they fast at all that out there?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: Greens are fast, but I like it that way. I like fast greens. They are perfect.
