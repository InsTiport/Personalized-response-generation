 Q. You managed a 6-under 65. Just some general comments on the round. 
 ANDRES ROMERO: I played a great round, and it was almost a perfect round, only that I double bogeyed 9. But I practiced a lot these last two weeks, and today I can do what I've been practicing these two weeks.

 Q. If you could just talk about the hiccup at 9. What happened? 
 ANDRES ROMERO: I hit a 6-iron. My caddie was telling me to hit a 7-iron just to the front of the green, but I'm so stubborn I stayed with the 6, and it buried in the bunker, in the wall. 

 Q. Where would the 7-iron have gone? 
 ANDRES ROMERO: Short of the green. He told me to be short of the green, just to approach and putt. 

 Q. (Question in Spanish.)
 ANDRES ROMERO: This is a good week to start playing good golf. After the last year I had last year, I think it's a good course. It suits me and my golf, my game, and luckily I started well.
