   ANDRES ROMERO: I'm playing really well, despite two big mistakes on the first day. I think I'm playing really well. 3-under for the last round is a great position.  
  
  Q. Do you think guys can come back now? The guys still in the field, can they come back and still be in the last group?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I don't know. I'm going to be in the last group, the second to last, but it's going to be fun because I'm going to be close.   
 The leader will be 5 or 6-under, but I'm going to be close. It's exciting for me to be in the mix.
