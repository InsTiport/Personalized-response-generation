Q.   (On his hole in one): 
ANDRES ROMERO:   I don't remember, I think I had about 193, and I hit it with a 7â€‘iron.   I wasn't sure if it was going to get there, so I knew I wanted to hit it pretty well, hit it pretty hard with a draw over towards the right bunker, and when it came off the club face, I knew I had hit it perfectly, and as soon as it hit the green, I heard the crowd starting to applaud, and I knew it was on the right line, and it just followed that line and trickled in.
