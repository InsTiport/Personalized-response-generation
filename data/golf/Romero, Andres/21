  Q. Where were you yesterday and where did you have to come back this morning?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: The course was really different this morning than yesterday. It was different with the wind blowing yesterday and the conditions were perfect, but it was good to make one under today after finishing yesterday. I guess I was 5-under yesterday.   
 So two birdies and one bogey today is also a great start.  
  
  Q. Now, are you going to get your sleep, nap? What did you do last week?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I was at home and lucky there was a tournament of the Argentina tour, so I went to play there just to be in rhythm. Finished second, and it was great to be in the rhythm I am here and playing good.  
  
  Q. It's never fun sitting out a major, right?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: No, no. I'm getting used to that with the majors, but I'm working on trying to get better, and I think that hopefully sooner I will be playing again in a major.   
  
  Q. You've been on the cusp of playing really well, though, right? Quail Hollow played well. You had some good tournaments. You feeling --  
 ANDRES ROMERO: Yeah. I played well three weeks, New Orleans, Charlotte and TPC. Those three courses I love them. New Orleans I won, of course, but Charlotte for me is one of the best courses on the PGA TOUR. Well, when I like the courses, I am more positive player.   
 Then I play in Dallas, but I was a little bit tired after being in the hunt. I haven't been in the hunt for a while, so those three weeks were special, and after that, those two weeks in Dallas I was a little bit tired, so I needed to go home for three weeks. I think it was a good rest.
