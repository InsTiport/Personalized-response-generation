  Q. 13-under, that was a very fine day. Did you think that would be good enough?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I don't know if it will be enough, but I'm very, very happy for those two rounds on Saturday and Sunday. They were really great, and it made me very happy, these two rounds.  
  
  Q. It must have been a great help to you playing with James Driscoll today because he was playing so well and you were seeing a lot of good shots at the flags. Was that helpful?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: He played a great round today. He played a great round today. We shared two great rounds, and it was great because I could see some good shots.  
  
  Q. What was the strength of your game this week?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I think that one of the keys was my putter. I made an excellent putt on 15 on Friday; I was like 1-over par before that hole, and that was a key putt, and after that I had a lot of confidence.  
  
  Q. And finally, what's the plan for the next two hours?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I'm going to go to the players' lounge to eat something and just see some TV, so we'll just see what happens.   
 I don't know if I'm going to win, but I finished and that's the most important thing because the score is there and they have to match the score. I played great these last 36 holes. I made just one bogey in 36 holes, and it's not very common of me to make one bogey in two rounds. But that was the key to being here in contention at this tournament.  
  
  Q. What positive lessons have you taken from your British Open experience where you made an 8? How have you turned those to your advantage?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I learned a lot that week. It was really -- I was really sad after that. It was a matter of experience. The following week I won in Hamburg and it was great. That gave me a lot of experience that I can use here.
