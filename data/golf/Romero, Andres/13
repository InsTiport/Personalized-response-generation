 Q.   There was a long discussion at the scoring area following your third round.   What happened out there?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   Well, I made a bad drop on 11 after hitting it in water.   I dropped it within a two‑club length.   I rolled outside that two‑club length.   
That happened to me last year at the Honda Classic, and I dropped it again.   This time the discussion was where the ball hit the ground, where it rolled to.   It was within two clubs, but outside my relief area, so it was a two‑shot penalty.   But that's the way golf works.   
   
 Q.   Besides that you found several problems on the back nine.   What changed in your game today?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   I hit it bad off the tee on 12.   But I didn't do that bad on the next few holes.   On 13 I hit okay.   On 14 I failed on a bunker save, a save that should have been easy.   Then on 17 I hit it in the water and had bogey there, finished with another bogey on 18.   
So the good thing is that today is over.   You know, golf gives you a lot, but it takes a lot from you as well.   The good thing is that there is still one round to play, so I'm going to give it a shot tomorrow.
