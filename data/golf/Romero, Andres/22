  Q. I know not the finish you wanted with the bogey at 18, but talk about your day. You're at 11-under par going into the final round.   
 ANDRES ROMERO: Yeah, I didn't like that. I think I hit a bad iron there and made a bogey, but anyway, I'm very happy with my score. It's going to be great to be there in the hunt. I don't know what the score will be after the finish of this round, but I will be there.   
  
  Q. I know this is your fourth time here. Your previous three trips here you missed the cut. I think tied for 40th has been your best finish here. Why the success this time? Are you getting to know this golf course and where to hit the shots?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: It's not just the course, I think I found my swing. That's the most important thing. After struggling a lot with my swing, I found something, and I think any course that I finish in the top 10, any course I set up my game would be great. But as you say, it's my fourth time here, and I like a lot this course, and that helps, also.   
  
  Q. Tell us about your round. 5-under today, and you're one off the lead. That's incredible.   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I'm playing great. I have a lot of confidence, especially after my last week in New Orleans where I finished top 10. I hit really good shots, and my confidence is -- I have a lot of confidence now, so I think 11-under is a good score to start tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the eagle on 15?   
 ANDRES ROMERO: I hit a great drive and then I had 250 yards, I think. I hit a 5-wood, and I hit a perfect shot, and I made eagle for the second time. I made eagle yesterday there, also. Well, great shot, and really good to be there on the leaderboard.
