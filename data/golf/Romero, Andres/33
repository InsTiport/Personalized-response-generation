   RODDY WILLIAMS:  Great round today.  How does it feel to be on top of the leaderboard going into the final round?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  I'm very happy with the position that I am and enjoying it much, very much.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  It was a great round today; everything just seemed to fall into place.   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  I'm playing very well to the green, and then on the green I'm playing even better, so obviously that helps a lot, and confidence helps on that one.   
  
  Q.  Tomorrow is going to be one week after Carnoustie.  Did you expect to be in this position a week later?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  In reality, on Sunday I was talking to my manager, and I was thinking whether to go back to Argentina or to come here.  Then I decided to come here because it's a very good course; I enjoyed it last year.  I hope this is worth that I've done that because I'm going to be playing eight weeks in a row after this.  So I really hope it was worth coming here.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it's a course that can play very easy, and what do you think in comparison to Carnoustie?  What makes you play so very, very good over here?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Carnoustie was a very tough week for the course, which is tough, the Open Championship.  This week the greens are very wet, so you can always play to the hole, and probably that makes a very big difference compared to Carnoustie.   
  
  Q.  Some exciting golf from you tomorrow, or will you maybe try and protect your lead?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  I'm going to go and play as I did today, and I'll try to do as good as I can and hopefully going to be looking good for me.   
  
  Q.  What did you do those two rounds at Loch Lomond, 77, 80?  Can you say what happened there?  And also what you did to overcome that before the Open?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  I did practise a lot on Friday, and unfortunately I did hit the ball very, very bad.  I did play very bad on the greens, as well.   
 And then I went to Carnoustie on Monday and did practise again a lot.  I did practise four hours on Friday, and then I practiced again on Monday in Carnoustie a lot because I couldn't believe why I was hitting so badly the ball and played the shot on 18.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Let's go through your round.  The eagle on 3?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Driver and a 5-iron, and it was like seven metres far.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Birdie on 4?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Drive and a pitch and it was very close, so I holed that one.   
 Birdie on 6, drive and a 3-iron, a pitch of 60 yards, and it was like one metre away.   
 Birdie on 8, 3-iron, 52 as a second shot, and I put it eight metres and holed that one.   
 Birdie on 12, very good drive and 9-iron, and from the -- and then a chip after that and holed that one, holed the chip.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  About how far was the chip, nine metres?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Nine metres.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  And then eagle on 15?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Drive, 3-iron, one metre and a half, two metres away.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  And then the birdie on 17?   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Drive, 3-iron and went straight, 60 yards for the third, and it was like three metres away.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Very well played, and good luck tomorrow.
