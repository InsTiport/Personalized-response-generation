 Q.   We were just saying kind of an up and down day.   Six birdies, five bogeys.   Normally be just 1‑under par, but with the way it is today, 7 points.   
ANDRES ROMERO:   (Through translation.)   Well, that is the secret of this format.   Even though I shot 1‑under I made seven points and I'm one behind the leaders.   
Yeah, I like this format.  
   
 Q.   Biggest difference between yesterday's round and today's round?   Yesterday bogey‑free.   What happened out there?   Any particular part of your game that wasn't clicking today?   
ANDRES ROMERO:   (Through translation.)   I hit the ball very consistent, like yesterday.   The difference was that I lost the ball in one hole.   
Then the main difference was the green.   I had several three‑putts on the green.   That was the main difference, you know, on the green.  
   
 Q.   Which hole did you lose the ball?  
ANDRES ROMERO:   (Through translation.)   13.   
   
 Q.   Last question:   21 points for two days; leaders are at 22.   You have to be happy with where you are through two rounds.   
ANDRES ROMERO:   (Through translation.)   That's a good thing.   I'm real happy for it and I'm looking forward for the weekend.
