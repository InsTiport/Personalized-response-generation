   ANDRES ROMERO: I am very happy after a very good round to be one shot behind the leaders and it is a very good start to the PGA Championship.  
  
  Q. How tough did you find the course?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I had the advantage that I hit very good tee shots and didn't hit the rough very often. And when I hit from the rough I made a putt which was good. The rough was very tough and the greens are quick so you have to be patient and luckily I was.  
  
  Q. Were you ever able to reach the green from the rough?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: No.  
  
  Q. What happened on the 18th?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: I hit a four iron. It was a soft shot, bad shot.  
  
  Q. Was it difficult coming back this morning to finish?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: The hard thing was getting up.  
  
  Q. Is a lot of patience required with so much stop starting?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: You can't do anything with the weather so just wait and just hope the weather stays good for the rest of the week.  
  
  Q. How does the course compare with others you have played over here?  
 ANDRES ROMERO: It's very tough but similar to the US Open at Torrey Pines with the rough. You have to be straight. The last two tournaments I have missed the cut so hope to have a good week this week and I have started well.
