 Q.  Thoughts on a 68?  
ANDRES ROMERO: I'm very happy, I played really good.  I'm happy to be here in Europe.  I haven't played here since 2007.  I haven't been in this position for a long time, so I'm happy about it.  I'm in a great position for tomorrow.  Today I hit the ball really good.  I only missed two shots and it cost me two bogeys.  On 18, we waited a long time on the tee box and I missed a driver in the water.  I need to focus on what I'm doing and keep playing well, and don't even look at the leaderboard.
