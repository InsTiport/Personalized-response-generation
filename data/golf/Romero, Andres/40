ANDRES ROMERO:  I haven't had a run of birdies like that (six in a row) over here before, but when I played at home in Argentina and shot 60 I had a run of birdies in that round and I had a feeling that that might happen again.

It was obviously possible for a 60 or 59, but I got a bit nervous over the drive on 16 and dropped a shot there and at 17 and finished well on 18, but it wasn't to be.
Q.  Eduardo Romero won here - can we have a second one?
ANDRES ROMERO:  Well, I would love to do that. I am playing well enough and I want to carry on playing well. At the moment I am not qualified for the Open but it is possible this week. Yes, I would love to qualify and have the opportunity to play in the Open or any major for that matter.
