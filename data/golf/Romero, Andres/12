Q.   Andres, if we can just get you to comment on your round today. 
ANDRES ROMERO:   Besides 11 and 12, I played really well today.   It was a good round.   I hit the drive very well, irons, and I feel very comfortable.   I felt good today.

Q.   What was the difference between yesterday and today?   What made you play better today?   What made you hit the ball a little better today? 
ANDRES ROMERO:   I played really well today, and yesterday was kind of similar.   The only difference is that I played two rough holes today.   I'm in great position and look forward.

Q.   Andres, going back to the 2007 British Open, you played very well there obviously and played well in a few Majors after that.   How important is it for you to get back into those Majors? 
ANDRES ROMERO:   I need to work very hard to get there.   Obviously, it's very important for a player to play in the Majors.   I'm not feeling very well at home watching the Majors on TV, but I'm working very hard to get there. 
I'm working with my psychologist, and I'm just working really hard.
