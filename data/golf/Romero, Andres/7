Q. One bogey, 3-under par, currently the low round of the day, you have to feel pretty good about your position right now?ANDRES ROMERO: Honestly, I got started hitting it a little bit poorly but got through that and a couple of the first holes and started hitting it a little better, and had a great round, especially through the back.  And honestly, I think that's my first round below par here.  I'm really happy with the round.
Q. How tough was the golf course playing today?ANDRES ROMERO: Honestly of all the years that I've played this tournament, looking at it today, the rough is very complicated and the fairways are narrow and the greens were playing very tough.  It's a tough course and it was much harder today than it was the first day, but those are all things that make for a difficult golf course, but a great one.
Q. A couple of things on the line.  Obviously a tournament here and then possibly The Open Championship.  I don't know if I would go anywhere if I were you.ANDRES ROMERO: I've already been told that I need to stick around but I'm very happy this week.  It's a special week.  Came through this year not playing very well.  I've missed a lot of cuts but just working through and the game has come around.  This is a very special week and if God hopes it to be, we will enter into the British and play in that.
