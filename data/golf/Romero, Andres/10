Q.   Another great finish, second year in a row, top 5.   Just some comments on the week overall. 
ANDRES ROMERO:     Well, I went to the city and to the tournament knowing that I needed to do a good tournament because I was behind in the FedExCup.   So I needed to play well. 
And the first two days was really two good days for me.   And the third day it wasn't very good, but I knew that I had one more day to go.   And I tried to do my best.   And it was a happy ending.
