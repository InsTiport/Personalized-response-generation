  STEVE ALKER:   The wind changed around.   It was damp and cold.   I kind of struggled the first five or six holes but got it going.   I played the back nine great already this week.   I stayed patient and made a few birdies there at the end.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   Coming in I bogeyed 6, I think it was, and then from there I didn't bogey in.   I birdied 15‑‑ I'm trying to think, sorry, I'll go backwards.   It was birdie on 13.   Then I birdied 15, which is a tough hole.   Then I birdied 18.   So just a bunch of pars in there.   A bit of scrambling, some good play.   Just a mix of everything, really.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   No, I made a couple of good putts.   I mean I hit good shots to where the pin was.   There's a lot of tough pins that are on slopes and the back of the green, so it was tough.   I just played smart and holed a couple of good putts for birdies.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   It was, yeah, with the wind.   It just switched around a bit, a few holes were back downwind so you could get a bit of a crack at it.   And some shorter irons into the green, which made it easier.

Q.   How was your game coming in? 
STEVE ALKER:   Pretty good.   I've been playing the Nationwide Tour.   My scores have been getting a lot better.   And obviously I went through the qualifying and shot a couple of good rounds there.   I'm pleased with it.   I'm happy with it, and just kind of continuing and just trying to keep doing what I've been doing.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   Oh, I couldn't tell you, to be honest.   Not sure about the weather.   The weather is amazing; we were expecting different conditions from this.   At 2‑under, obviously a good position.   I feel good.   I'm just kind of waiting to see, really.

Q.   Where are you staying?
STEVE ALKER:   Yeah, about 15 minutes away.   I've got my family here this week, so we're just keeping it relaxed.   My wife is working for me.   She's on the bag this week.   We're just trying to have a little bit more fun this week.

Q.   What's her name? 
STEVE ALKER:   It's Tanya. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   She is, correct. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   Well, I'm not, but she is, yeah. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   Do you really?   Well, there you go.   Well, she's down just off the A2 there and Broadway, not far out of the town. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE ALKER:   I've played there a few times.   I go down there and play when I'm there.   We live in Phoenix.   I play in the States.   But we've been back here for a couple of weeks before the tournament and just kind of hanging out there and catching up with friends.   It's been fun. 

Q.   How are you handling the driving issues here?
STEVE ALKER:   Yeah, yesterday I kept my nose clean and I stayed out of all the bunkers, today with the different wind early on a hit it in a couple of fairway bunkers, a little bit of rough.   But over the last two days I think I've been in maybe two fairway bunkers.   So that's not too bad.   I'd like to be in none.   But over the course of the week if you can stay out of the fairway bunkers you've done very well, very well.

Q.   What's the best part of your game?   Sounds like ball‑striking might be right there. 
STEVE ALKER:   Yeah, it's pretty solid.   I'm not long.   I like to think this kind of course suits me a little bit because you have to plod your way around and hit your spots.   I've been putting well this week.   My short game feels pretty good.   It's normally in pretty good shape.   That's kind of helped me out pretty well.   But some nice putts coming down the stretch that are from 20, 30 feet have been pretty solid.

Q.   They gave us a notice and said they speeded up the greens.   Did you notice?
STEVE ALKER:   They definitely did.   I noticed the putting green straightaway speeded up a bit.   And the first couple of greens were almost a foot quicker, even with the rain.   So, yeah, I kind of picked it up pretty quick, which was beneficial.
