 Q.  Probably a tough week for you, but quite a lot of positives you can take from this week?  
SHARMA SHUBHANKAR: Yeah, I'm happy that I competed this week amongst the best in the world.  Even though I didn't have my best this week, I think you always learn when you play.   
This year has been a huge learning for me.  I've played in some of the big events and learned a lot, and this week again, I think I learned a lot.  Played decent on the weekend.  Could have gone lower than what I did the first two days.  But I felt like the game was better than the first two days, and that's good enough for me to take into the next weeks.   
 Q.  I'm sure now you're turning your attention to the Asian Tour.  
SHARMA SHUBHANKAR: Yeah, I'll be playing Hong Kong and the next few events after that.  So looking forward to playing well now.  It's high time.  It's the end of the year now and I feel like I have to do my best to have a chance to win the Order of Merit and I'll try and do that.   
 Q.  Playing among the world's best players, I'm sure you're feeling a bit comfortable, as well, in this company?  
SHARMA SHUBHANKAR: Yeah, I'm very comfortable now.  In the beginning obviously I was a bit starry-eyed playing in this field and looking at all the players, but now I know it's just all about me playing and playing against the course, which good.  I feel like it will help me in the future.
