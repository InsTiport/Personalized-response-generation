 Q.  A final day, perhaps of disappointment now, but on reflection, signs that you're steadily improving on The European Tour?  
GRANT FORREST: Yeah, you know, I was cruising along after eight holes and made probably my worst swing much the week on 9 in the water.  Took double.  But gave myself lots of chances coming in.  I had good chances on 18, 17, I think 14 I hit a lovely shot into the par 3 and missed.   
Yeah, just wasn't to be.  Putts just didn't drop on the back nine.  But it was great just being in the mix.  Yeah, I know that my game's not far away, so it's really encouraging.
