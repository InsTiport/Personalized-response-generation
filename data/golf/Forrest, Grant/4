 Q.  That was a great comeback in the back nine, so you're very much in contention now.  How did you do it?  
GRANT FORREST: It was an up-and-down day.  I had, I think the first par was on the sixth, so I had a couple silly mistakes, missed a short one on the third for par, for a bogey on 4, the par 5 -- sorry, on the 5th, the par 5.  Hit some nice shots and a couple nice birdies.   
I think it was really 8 and 9 that got me going.  Hit two good shots into 8 to the front of the green and night two-putt, hit one close on 9, quite a tough par 3, and yeah, from there, just had to do a bit of scrambling.  It's getting firmer out there and if you're not in the fairways, it's really tough to hole the green.  So I was just trying to miss it in the correct places and yeah, managed to just sort of grind it out.   
 Q.  How important has The Challenge Tour experience been to you, and winning a card that way, has it taken you long to settle in or do you feel like you're ready to shoot low scores out here?  
GRANT FORREST: Yeah, I think shooting low scores is what The Challenge Tour sets you up for, but I wouldn't say it necessarily prepares you fully for courses as tough as this.  This is obviously one of the toughest that we played, but I think playing a full season out there, two full seasons, and you know, just it gets you used to the tour life and I think prepares you for life on The European Tour.   
 Q.  You've made plenty of cuts in your first 11 starts, but you started very well with a Top-10 in Mauritius.  What's the aspiration now that you're really in the thick of it?  
GRANT FORREST: To win.  That's why everyone's here for, I hope.  I think when you're in that position, obviously you don't know what's going to happen, but that's what we're trying to do tomorrow.
