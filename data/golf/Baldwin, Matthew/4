  MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I'm very happy.   It was such a tough week, every year it's so demanding.   You know at the start of the week if you shoot four level pars, you've done well.   To be 2‑under, it's good.  
   
 Q.   You got it going for a while on the final day.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   The conditions today have been so tough.   Anything under par, around par, even 1‑over par is a really good score.   I see McDowell had 4‑under, that's impressive golf.  
   
 Q.   Did you get a sense of just how well you were traveling and your chance on that leaderboard.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   No, I tried to do my own thing and see where it takes me.   But you can't help noticing your name up there and things like that.   Yeah, you get a sense that you're doing well.   
I hit a poor shot into 14 which kind of halted the momentum a bit, and then I actually hit a really good shot into 15 but found the water.   So slightly disappointing then, but birdie on 17 to take me back up again.  
I've been playing well pretty much most of the year.   Just have not always had the results go my way.   To have a couple of Top‑5 finishes in my last three weeks, it's been great.  
   
 Q.   Do you fancy a win is around the corner?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I've played well all year.   Got to wait for my week.   
   
 Q.   The result of The Irish Open meant that you were in The Open Championship, and that Claret Jug is sitting along there because there's more qualifiers this week.   Have you made all your plans?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Just about.   I've got The Scottish Open first.   So it's still at the back of my mind, but I can't wait to get to Hoylake.
