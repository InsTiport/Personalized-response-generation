 Q.  How excited are you to be playing again after illness last year?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Delighted.  It was a long summer last year.  To be playing well so early on, it's a nice feeling.   
 Q.  And you'd be forgiven for having a little bit of rust in your game, only your fifth event back, I believe, so how excited are you with your play this week?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: It's been brilliant.  First four tournaments I played were very rusty, but stayed patient, enjoyed what I'm doing and hopefully the results will come.   
 Q.  What is it about your game that's stood out?  It's quite a tough golf course.  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Fairways and greens, really.  My iron play has been lovely.  I've got a couple of new additions this week.  So yeah I can't complain with the way I've hit it.  Maybe not holed as many putts as should I do because the greens are pure, but you know, there's always this afternoon.   
 Q.  And just finally, it's quite bunched, the scoring, so does that mean you have to be a little more aggressive with your attitude towards this afternoon's round?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: I'm just going to carry on doing my thing and see where it takes me.  There's plenty of opportunities if you keep the ball in play.
