 Q.  A 67 and share of the lead, did you feel like you had a score like that in you?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, I've been hitting the ball really nicely, so it was definitely in there.  It's just I putted really well today, chipped and putted really well, which conditions like this, that's what you've got to do.   
 Q.  Give us a sense of the conditions on a difficult golf course?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, it's really windy.  It's changing direction all the time, and then obviously it's firm and bouncy, as well.  So you've got to consider where you've got to land the ball, but you know, not knowing -- the wind is changing from shot-to-shot, so it's hard to judge what you've got to do.   
 Q.  Apart from the blemish on the last, overall, pleased with your game?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, absolutely.  4-under a day at any golf course is good.  Around a tough golf course like this, then yeah, absolutely.   
 Q.  Is it very much a consolidation from here, bearing in mind the top 64 qualify for the match play?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, you go out and shoot the best scores you can.  Where I finish after two days is irrelevant, as long as I'm in the top 64, top 32.
