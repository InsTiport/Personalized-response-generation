  MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was a nice day.   A lot of putts holed again and put it in the right spots on the golf course.  
   
 Q.   Certainly that back nine, nice figures coming your way and moving up that board?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was good.   Can't complain.   Two rounds in, long way to go, but keep holing putts and I'll have a good chance at the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Any difference playing in an afternoon compared to morning here?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Generally the rough's a lot drier, so you can get a bit more club on it.   Obviously the greens are a bit firmer, a bit faster, a bubblier, but have to adapt to that and get on with it   
   
 Q.   Wind is up?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It's probably a club, so it's nothing too serious.   
   
 Q.   How easy is it to stay just firmly in the present rather than racing ahead or getting too excited about positions?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, it is difficult.   This is what you are trained to do, so it's part and parcel of it.   That's what you've got to keep trying to do.  
   
 Q.   Are you actually trained to do it or is it just something that you have to pick up with experience?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Definitely have to get better but I'm getting there.   Keep getting better at it and it will be all right.   
   
 Q.   I take it you feel the game is in nice shape at the moment, anyway?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, last couple weeks been good, and I think the main difference is I've been holing a lot of putts, you can see in my scores.
