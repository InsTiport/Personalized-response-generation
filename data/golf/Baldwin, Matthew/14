Q.   What a good score that was, how did it come about today?
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Great start, been swinging nicely the last few weeks and just took it to the course today.

Q.   You certainly played well in Austria a couple of weeks ago and that seems a continuation. 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, hope so.   I seem to have found something in my golf swing and taking it to the course.   So worked it out. 

Q.   Will you tell us what it is?
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I just need to get the club out in front of me a bit more, it's been getting a bit behind me and a lit late, so just got a drill to fix that.

Q.   Did you need to be told that? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, it's a continuous thing with me really.   Found a drill now that seems to work, so hopefully it will be a thing of the past.

Q.   One of these games with such fine margins because it can just knock you out of place and you don't realise it's happening and the next minute you click and off you go again. 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, it's fine margin.   It's a good start.   We've got three more days left and see where it takes us.

Q.   Is it easy out there? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I think it's as easy as you're going to get it, yeah.   If you miss the fairways, you get some tricky lies.   So hit a lot of fairways and greens, you get a lot of chances.

Q.   Are you more aggressive? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I think you've got to be tactical really.   Could have taken it on on 18, but laid up and pitched and putted.   So I think sensible at the right times and knowing when to attack.
