  MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was a very good week.   I said early on in the week I had been working hard on my putting and it's paid off this week.   It's been really solid.  
   
 Q.   We missed you on the third day but you got yourself back into contention and you've built on it.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was nice.   I stuck at it for most of the day.   A couple of hiccups here and there but the final round in a big tournament, you're going to get that.  
   
 Q.   Were aware the leaders were not running away?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   My sports psychologist would say I shouldn't be, but they are in your eye line, you can't really miss them, but try not to.  
   
 Q.   But you would have been aware that you had a chance even down the home stretch?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, I knew I needed to get to 14 or 15, but unfortunately it didn't happen.   But overall, just a great week.   
   
 Q.   And it's great in terms of the number of people here?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, I was commenting on it to my caddie, how many people were here.   It's great to see.   It's a shame every week's not like this.  
   
 Q.   Well, every week is a big event at this moment and lots coming up.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, it's going to be a busy time now, so looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts at gaining qualification to The Open Championship?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I played two years ago at Lytham, which was quite local to me, as well.   To play at Royal Liverpool, it's great.   
   
 Q.   Do you know these courses well?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I don't know Royal Liverpool as much.   I haven't played it for a good six or seven years to be fair.   I played it quite a lot as an amateur, county golf and amateur championships and things like that.   
   
 Q.   But the nuances and nature of links golf is different to what I have week‑in and week‑out?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I grew up playing golf at Ascot and moved to Royal Birkdale when I was 18, so I've grown up on links golf.   Touch wood, won't be anything new to me.  
   
 Q.   As a kid, surely The Open Championship was one that you wanted to be in.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Definitely.   Dream of playing, possibly winning The Open one day.   It's brilliant.   
   
 Q.   As a local, will you have plenty of support do you reckon?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I hope so.   Pretty sure you'll do well to keep my family away, and I have a lot of friends and that that I'm sure will wander down most days.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember Royal Liverpool from last time?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I do.   It was very dry.   I remember Tiger cleaning up.   
   
 Q.   Did you go?   Did you watch?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   No, I didn't.   I think I would have been away at an amateur tournament.
