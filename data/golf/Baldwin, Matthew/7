  MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was a good start.   Started off really nicely, hit a 4‑iron to about a foot on the 10th for eagle, so that was a great start.   
   
 Q.   Describe the feeling when you had the eagle straightaway.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It's a great momentum builder, and I actually wrote down a 4 not thinking, so I had to correct it.   But it was great momentum builder and then to follow up with some birdies late in the back nine‑‑ my front nine, the back nine, it was good.  
   
 Q.   6‑under, one of the best rounds of the afternoon tee times.   Looking forward to tomorrow?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, definitely, hoping the greens will be a bit softer.   They got a bit toasty towards the end of the round, but you can see by the scoring, the weather has been great and the greens are rolling really well, so you're going to hole putts if you're hitting on the right line.  
   
 Q.   Can you describe the differences between the front nine and back nine?   A lot of people started on the back nine and scored pretty low today?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I think three par 5s always helps and they are all within reach.   You're always looking at making two birdies out of three, and then you have a tough stretch on the front nine which from 5 onwards is quite a tough stretch,5 to 9.   Two different nines but great golf course.  
   
 Q.   Conditions today?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Superb.   You can see it in the scoring, strong at the top end and like I said, the greens are superb so you're going to hole the putts.
