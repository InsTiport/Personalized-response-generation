Q.   Thoughts on moving back into contention after a quiet day on day two?
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It was a good day.   To not drop any shots on this golf course is pretty good.   Hit the ball lovely and long may it continue.

Q.   Plenty of highlights, scrambling nicely? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, I was just saying earlier, I thought I was going to drop a shot on 16 but I holed a 20‑footer to not break the momentum and two good shots on the last and nice 2‑putt to finish off.

Q.   Are you conscious of the way things have developed across the week, slipping back and then getting back into the run of things?
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   No, not really.   You just go play golf and see what happens.   Yesterday was a tough day, drove the ball well but didn't play well with my irons so to shoot level par was good. 

Q.   Is that one of the things at the start of the year, struggling for the consistency a little? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I think so, a bit of rustiness and like I said, level par is never a bad score around this course, and then obviously to come out and shoot 69 today is good. 

Q.   What do you think about 8‑under, nicely placed? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, it's good.   I don't think anyone's running away, so I'm in good position for tomorrow.

Q.   Exciting, isn't it, especially when it the start of the year? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, this is what we all want to do.   We want to compete for tournaments.   It's a nice position to be in.

Q.   Do you feel the benefit of having been in this position before? 
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, I learned a lot back end of last year, definitely.   So I know now obviously to stay calm and relaxed and wait for my chances to arise.
