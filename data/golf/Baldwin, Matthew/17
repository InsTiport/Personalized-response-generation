  MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Last week was very disappointing and did some great work with my coach, Alan Thompson, and here we are, so that's been good.  
   
 Q.   And that was in the interim over the Monday and Tuesday?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Tuesday, Wednesday this week.   We had a bit of a fight trying to get there but we eventually got there and it was‑‑ as I said, it's worked.   
   
 Q.   A bit of a fight?   Elaborate.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Just same old stuff.   He has to battle to get it into my head what we've got to do and I'm quite set in my ways of doing certain things.   He wants me to move forward and so on.   As I said, we had a few disagreements here and there.   I've been with him 14 years or something like that, 13 years, and he's like my dad now.   
   
 Q.   So you're stubborn, as opposed to a slow learner.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I'm a quick learner but quite stubborn, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What was he trying to get you to do?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   To get my body up more.   I have a tendency for my body to stop and my hands to take over.   So he wanted me to work more on my body on the way down.  
   
 Q.   You grew up on links?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, and joined Royal Birkdale what I was 18.   For me Royal Birkdale is the best course in Britain.   And to come here and play such a great course, as well, as a links course, is great.  
   
 Q.   Different kind of links, though, isn't it?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, the fairways are quite generous.   But I mean, it's still the same sort of shots you've got to play, the ones that run up the green.   But it's a modern links, whereas Birkdale, Lytham, all of the classic ones are very traditional.  
   
 Q.   And it's the weather that makes a big difference?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Definitely.   It's a lot of turns and I think it will be a different golf course.  
   
 Q.   Happy with your position on the board?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, I am, now I'm finished, yeah.   It's a good position to be in as long as the leaders don't run away this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   Not the first time this season.   Getting more and more used to it?   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   Yeah, got to keep playing steady and take each day where it comes and see where it gets me at the end of the day.  
   
 Q.   Not only this week, you don't want to get ahead of yourself but you don't want to think too much of next week, do you?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   I can't wait for next week.   It's my first Open.   I was lucky enough to play the U.S. Open, first Open and it's great because it's so local to me and they are such a great support.  
   
 Q.   Where does the balance lie?   Do you use this more as preparation?  
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   No, this is the most important thing in my life this week, and next week will be again the most important thing that week.   It's one week at a time.   I've got a job to do here and hopefully if I keep playing well, it will be a nice weekend.   
   
 Q.   Easier said than done to keep that focus.   
MATTHEW BALDWIN:   It is, but you've got to do it.   Like I said, this week is more important than next week at the moment.
