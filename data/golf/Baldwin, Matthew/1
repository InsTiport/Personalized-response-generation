Q. On to the knock out stage, how pleased are you about your opening two rounds?
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, it's been a good two days.  Today it was really solid tee-to-green.  Not quite as good around greens as it was yesterday but all in all I'm very happy.
Q. Was it just a matter of getting the job done?
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, slightly unusual.  Obviously, touched it on it yesterday, but it doesn't really matter where you finish because tomorrow, you go one-on-one.  So it was just about plodding along and hitting a sensible shot.
Q. Do you feel the conditions were slightly easier?
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Yeah, it was cold first thing so the ball wasn't going as far and the rough was a little bit wet.  It was tricky at times but as the day has gone on, I'd say it has gotten slightly easier, yeah.
Q. Going into tomorrow, you touched on it, it doesn't matter, but the seeding higher up has to be better, doesn't it?
MATTHEW BALDWIN: Absolutely.  If you're in the Top-10, Top 15, it means you're playing well.  So if you're half a shot up on the guy who has just made the cut, sort of thing, already, mentally, yeah, absolutely.
Q. Obviously the mind-set changes, or does it?
MATTHEW BALDWIN: I don't really know.  I've never played stroke play, match play before.  Obviously you just have to beat one guy each round, so it's going to be different.  I'm looking forward to it.
