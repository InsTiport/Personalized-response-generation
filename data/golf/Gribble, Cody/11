 Q.  Great round of golf.  Just get some comments.  
CODY GRIBBLE: It was good.  Really didn't hit the ball spectacular.  Finally made some more putts.  Got some things to work on, though.  Last week or two weeks ago at Safeway I was hitting my tee ball and putting well.  My tee ball was a little better today, but I still got some more to do with that, but putter felt great and hopefully I can keep that going.   
 Q.  You obviously like this golf course, but how does it suit your game?  
CODY GRIBBLE: It's good.  Usually I'm a great driver I'd say.  And so this course really demands fairways to be hit.  So I think yesterday my tee ball was not very good, which is unlike me, so if I can get the tee ball back to my usual self, I should actually have a good weekend.   
 Q.  Four pars to start the round and 9-under on your last.  Just comment about what it feels like to be on a roll like this.  
CODY GRIBBLE: Yeah.  It's a good feeling.  And it's funny, today was a little different just because I've been kind of scrambling a little bit and not really focused on I know everything was going very well.  I was just more fat side of the green, play a little bit conservative.  Yesterday I made too many I'd say immature mistakes, and so I tried to mainly focus on that.  So I had a bogey-free round.  It's great, but I was just really trying to play very smart and conservative, and conservatively aggressive is what I usually like to call it.  So it was solid.  Hope to keep it going.   
 Q.  Perfect.  Thank you very much.
