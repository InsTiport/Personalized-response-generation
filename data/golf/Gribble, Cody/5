Q. Just some comments, everybody's talking about that video of the alligator.
CODY GRIBBLE: I didn't realize it was on video, but the gator looked like he needed some exercise, I don't know.  But he was sitting right there in the way and, you know, I guess I was trying to get some adrenaline going somehow, but I wasn't really afraid of it, there was really nothing to say about it.
Q. Done something like that before?  It looked like it wasn't your first time.
CODY GRIBBLE: I've done it a couple times before.  If you think if that's crazy, you should meet my father, Bill Gribble.  Next time you see him, have an interview with him.  He loves all types of animals, but, yeah.
Q. Was that about eight feet do you think?
CODY GRIBBLE: Yeah, it was, it wasn't a 10-footer, it was probably about eight foot, yeah.
Q. Do your sponsors ever say they would really rather you not do that?
CODY GRIBBLE: (Laughter.)  You know, probably, it's probably frowned upon, but I wasn't too worried about it at the time.  Those guys, I mean, it's like a jolt, it's quick, they're not going to catch you, they're not going to catch you a couple of steps down.  I mean, they're going to get you really quick early, but it's, I mean, I'm not in its way, I'm right behind him, it's not going to happen.
Q. You ever tapped one and had it turn around on you?
CODY GRIBBLE: Yeah, I have.  But it hasn't got me.  They're quick, but they're not that quick.  We have caught them before, I've caught them before, fishing before, too.  It's fun, it's fun, I like -- I'm not going to hurt them or anything, he's beautiful.  And, actually, I don't know if you ever felt an alligator, but like their skin is incredibly clean, but I don't know.
Q. We'll take your word for it.
CODY GRIBBLE: You can feel my face next week and see.
(Laughter.)
