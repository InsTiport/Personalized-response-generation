  Q. How good was what you saw from Matt Jones today?
 ADAM HADWIN:   It was one of the best rounds I've seen in my life.  Obviously we had less winds, seven, eight holes to begin with.  Really didn't pick up until 9, so there were opportunities, and he took full advantage of them.  That play through the last 10 holes there in this wind is pretty good.  To add another at least four, maybe five on the back side, that was -- he hit it in all the right spots.  He didn't make any mistakes.  He made a couple putts, and he just hit it so solid that the wind obviously was affecting it, but it played exactly how he wanted it to.  It was fun to watch.
 Q. How many times did you say "good shot"?
 ADAM HADWIN:   I just stopped saying it at a certain point.  He just hit so many, you just stop saying it.  You're just under the assumption that it was good.
