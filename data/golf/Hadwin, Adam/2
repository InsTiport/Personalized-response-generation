  Q. Three rounds under par after Day 1.  Can you summarize your week?
 ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah.  A bit of an awkward start, I guess, today.  Tough lie in the bunker on 5 and didn't get the next one.  I told myself at the beginning of the day I was just going to try and stay patient and just pick target and make golf swings today and whatever happened happened, and tested my patience a bit early but it was nice to bounce back with a chip-in on 6 and made some nice putts.
 Got on a roll there 9 through 12, and it feels disappointing to end with a bogey on 16, but it is what it is, onward, upward, and we'll keep working.
 Q. What about the conditions today?
 ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, pretty much the same.  I think, again, some of the greens got a little firmer.  I think some of them stayed softer.  Really depends on where you land, into the grain, downgrain, that sort of thing.
 You know, I think another good score is out there today.  Just got to -- again, it's a tricky place when you get into some wrong spots.  But if you're hitting it well you're going to have a lot of chances.
