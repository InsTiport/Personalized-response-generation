Q. What is it about you and the desert, you had 8 birdies out there, two bogeys, 6-under par, and on still a difficult golf course.
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I don't know, it always seems to bring out the best in my game.  Kind of shaky a little early, made a few birdies, kind of hit some sloppy shots, but strong finish there at the end, three in a row to finish, and we're off to a good start.
Q. I had you down for 22 putts.  Good job.
ADAM HADWIN: I rolled it today, honestly, it could have been a lot higher.  I made a couple bogey putts, some good par putts and then a couple nice ones there to finish for birdie.
Q. I always think back to the first time I ever saw you play, you were still in college, in the Canadian Open, and I had a question whether you would ever be a good enough putter to be on the PGA TOUR and now I think you're one of the better putters on TOUR.
ADAM HADWIN: Hopefully you're not questioning whether or not I can hit it good enough to be out here, but, no, no, you know what, it's just hard work, I figured out very quickly when I turned pro that if I couldn't make putts, it didn't matter how well I hit it.  So we, I just grinded my butt off and here I am today, like you said, one of the better putters out here.
