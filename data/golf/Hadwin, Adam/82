 Q. How do you feel, Adam?
 ADAM HADWIN: It was a lot of fun. That front nine I just hit some bad shots, I hit some bad putts. It just -- it was just an up-and-down day. I'd hit a bad shot, would recover and hit a great shot and just not make a putt. 
 But to finish birdie, birdie. I hit it stiff in there on 17 four feet, made that, and that shot on 18 to close my Canadian Open, I couldn't have asked for anything more to hit it to a foot.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah. It landed about three inches left of the pin and stayed about five inches to a foot long. 

 Q. You talked about being sort of overwhelmed yesterday. 
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah.

 Q. How did it feel walking up 18 to your ball today?
 ADAM HADWIN: Oh, I really didn't know what to think. It was an amazing feeling. The fans this week have kind of taken me in as the Canadian favorite this week. I can't thank them enough for that. I don't think I was the favorite out there. But it was a lot of fun playing in front of them today. I hope I get to experience that some more.

 Q. What do you think you learned about yourself this week?
 ADAM HADWIN: That I can compete, for sure. There's a lot of things I need to tighten up, though, a lot of things on the greens, my short game I need to tighten up, but ball striking wise, I think I can compete out here.

 Q. Are you going right back out on Tour?
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah. I got about 10 days off now. I'm going to take all 10 days off for sure.

 Q. Jane Rogers then?
 ADAM HADWIN: Yes. Jane Rogers up in Greystone. 

 Q. There was a few times I noticed you and Briny chatting during breaks in play. Was he giving you any advice or was he talking to you about baseball?
 ADAM HADWIN: No. Actually, you know what we were talking about, we were talking about his P.F. Chang's ad where he got to hit off the building into PETCO Park in San Diego. So I remember seeing that one. I thought it was real cool. I guess he just did another one out in New York City into the Hudson. So we were talking a little bit about that. 
 But it was a lot of fun. He's a great guy. He's obviously been around for a while now, and he's got a lot of wisdom he can share with me.

 Q. Did you do a good job of keeping your mind in it today do you think?
 ADAM HADWIN: I did, yeah. No, I felt good out there. I just wasn't comfortable with the swing out there today, especially with the driver. It was a struggle to hit a fairway. But the last two -- I kind of want to go play on 18, because I feel real good now finishing birdie, birdie.

 Q. Have you exceeded your expectations coming in?
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah. I just wanted to come in and play well and represent Canada and show that the Canadian Tour really does deserve these exemptions into this and show them that we can play at this higher stage. 

 Q. Should fans come out and watch the Tour?
 ADAM HADWIN: The Canadian Tour? Absolutely. You know, they say the Nationwide is the proving ground for the PGA TOUR. I think the Canadian Tour is just as good of proving grounds for the Nationwide and the PGA. These next three or four years you're going to see a ton of guys come off the Canadian Tour and play competitively on the PGA.

 Q. How big are those two birdies at the end in terms of what you'll take out of here?
 ADAM HADWIN: Oh, massive. You know, a 71 always feels better birdieing the last then bogeying the last. So you know, it's the same score, but for some reason birdieing the last you feel a sense of accomplishment. You stuck in the round and you were able to fight it out. 
 I've got the biggest smile on my face, I'm sure you guys can tell, and it's going to stay the rest of the week.

 Q. What about money wise?
 ADAM HADWIN: Oh, money wise it's even better. (Laughs). Absolutely, yeah. No, if you bogey the last, you're looking at, oh, how much did I lose, and now I'm looking at how much did I gain those last two holes.

 Q. Are you going to celebrate tonight?
 ADAM HADWIN: Absolutely.

 Q. Do you know how that's going to go down?
 ADAM HADWIN: I have no idea yet. No, I'll probably celebrate with the host family that's here. My dad flew in on the red eye last night with my coach and my brother, so it was real exciting to have them out there. 
 I wish I could have played better for them and all the fans here, but to end birdie, birdie and hit that shot on 18, I think they were quite impressed with that.

 Q. What did you hit into there?
 ADAM HADWIN: A 5-iron.

 Q. How were you nerves out there? Did you have any time where you were racing out there, out of control?
 ADAM HADWIN: A little bit on the greens. A little bit on the greens, depending on the putt. But I felt pretty good. I felt comfortable all week, really. I was a little bit surprised about that, but I was kind of in my element out there. I felt good, and I just stuck with the same routine all week.

 Q. Will you hang out and watch where Jon Mills goes from here?
 ADAM HADWIN: Likely, yeah. I'm going to go back up there, and those kids wanted some autographs, so I'll go back up there; and I think I've given away all I have.

 Q. What did you think of the football game?
 ADAM HADWIN: Oh, it was a great football game. They got me great tickets, and those Lions were playing pretty well. I might have to give Lulay a call about that late interception. 
 But no, it was a great game. They played well. The Argos pulled it off in the end, though.

 Q. Will it be tough to go back to the Canadian Tour now after getting a taste of this, or will you be any more motivated now?
 ADAM HADWIN: I think it's more motivation now. Absolutely, yeah. It kind of throws you into celebrity status out here for a little while for a week, and I think it makes you hungrier to get back out here. 
 You know, I have a lot of friends on the Canadian Tour. I have a great time out there. It'll be nice to be back with them for the upcoming weeks, but it's definitely a lot of motivation to get out here and be treated like these guys do.

 Q. Do you like the celebrity status?
 ADAM HADWIN: Yes and no. I'm not used to it, so it'll take some time to get used to.

 Q. You talked yesterday about not getting caught up in this kind of stuff. 
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah.

 Q. How dangerous is that and how do you avoid that?
 ADAM HADWIN: Family. Friends. I think if you can keep -- you know, your family's always going to keep you grounded first. I'm close with my family, so that's going to help. 
 But you know, having a close group of friends that doesn't see me as the fans saw me this week, as just Adam, which I am, you know. This week was just kind of a bonus week, I guess for me.

 Q. Good bonus. 
 ADAM HADWIN: Yeah. Absolutely. A great bonus. 

 Q. Thanks for your time, Adam.
