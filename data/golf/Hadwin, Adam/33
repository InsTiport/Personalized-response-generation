 Q.  What can you tell us about the day.  There was a lot of frustration for you?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, there was plenty of it.  This is pretty much a microcosm of my season so far.  One putt here, one putt there, I make the cut.  You know, not saving par on 6, I think was perfect explanation of how my season's going.  Start off okay, getting things into a groove, and then miss a par putt and stall out for a few holes.  I battled back after a couple bad holes there on 13, 14, and gave myself a chance, I just couldn't do it.   
 Q.  What is your disappointment level right now?  
ADAM HADWIN: 100 out of 10.  You come here, obviously, with the highest of expectations and want to play well in front of the home crowd.  I felt my game has been pretty good all year.  I've hit a lot of good shots.  I just can't seem to get it done.   
 Q.  Any takeaways, Adam?  
ADAM HADWIN: I getting to home to see my dog.  That's probably the biggest one.  I'll be on a flight as quick as I can, go pick up the dog, hang out for a few days, then go up to Akron and reboot.  I've got two big events before the playoffs still, so there is still lots to play for.  Just keep digging.   
You know, who knows, that putt goes in on 18, and I may finish Top 10 this week.  It's that close.   
 Q.  It's only your second missed cut of the season.  Any look at the big picture?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, like I said, it's close.  It's obviously extremely frustrating to basically live on the cut line every week.  It's tough.  It's nerve-racking.  I'm getting a lot of gray hair from it, I know that.  But it's just one of those things.  I've got to keep working hard.  I've got to keep putting in the effort and know that the fruits of the labor will hopefully show up at some point, and be ready for it when it does.
