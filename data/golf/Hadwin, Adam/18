Q. How did you feel about that round today?
ADAM HADWIN: Again, I played really solid to start the round of golf.  Kind of got away from me in the middle again.  Just kind of brought it home, I guess.
Q. Another good start.  Talk about 7, that eagle there.  You've made a 3, 4, 5, and 6 there this week.
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I hit two good shots, great drive, good 3-wood, just went over the back of the green and then just kind of nipped the ridge perfectly.  Those are ones you're not necessarily trying to make up over a ridge like that.  It was going to settle nice and close, and it was a bonus to go in.
Q. 11 looked like you had to take a drop, I saw.
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I hit it short right.  11 is such a good hole today, it's going to play so tough.  I didn't miss the tee shot by much, just the wind kind of grabbed it a little bit more, took it into a bit of a nasty lie in the rough, took an unplayable and couldn't get up and down to save bogey.
Q. You were playing great coming into this.  What do you take into this week going back?
ADAM HADWIN: Nothing, to be honest.  I shouldn't say "nothing."  I learned to control the shot a little bit more in some heavy left-to-right breeze that we didn't have before.  So I can take that away.
But the golf is so different and so different from what we'll see the rest of the year that it's kind of going back and just resetting.
Q. I was thinking in particular of your putter.  Do you almost give yourself a mulligan with the conditions so different, the greens so different?  The putter was going well coming into this.  Do you try to forget about this and assume it will be waiting for you back home?
ADAM HADWIN: For sure.  Yeah, I just go back home, got an off week.  So keep doing the same things I've been doing.  It's been working up until now.  And then we'll just head over to Greensboro and try to get used to the speed of the greens over there.
Q. Links golf on the whole, could you see a 50- or 60-year-old Adam Hadwin coming back and spending a month and tour around here?  What do you think?
ADAM HADWIN: We'll see if the wife will let me do that, that's probably the biggest question.  But it's fun.  It would be a fun boys' trip over here, playing a bunch of different golf courses and different golf.
I really enjoy my time over here.  I've enjoyed this week, I just wish the golf had been a little bit better.
Q. You were talking about resetting.  Do you look at new goals for the rest of the year?  The majors are done but you've moved your World Ranking up a few spots in 2019.  There's a lot more to do.  Is that what you do, reset new goals?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, when I was speaking of resetting, it was more resetting the swing and where everything is at.  Certain habits creep in when you're trying to play certain shots over here day after day.  So I'll probably have to go back -- typically you get a little steep trying to hit it low all the time.  I'll go back and refresh, get back to the range and get back to basics.
But goals don't change.  Still some big events left.  Still a lot to play for.
Q. And the Presidents Cup, the playoffs coming up, your World Ranking is creeping back up to that near 50.  If you get in there a lot of things open up, WGCs, there's a lot on the horizon.  Optimistic about what you can accomplish the rest of the season?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, absolutely.  Been playing some good golf.  I did a lot of good things this week.  Unfortunately I counteracted that with a lot of bad things.
But, yeah, just take the positives out of this week, go back and just keep grinding out.  We have four more weeks left in the season and that's it.
Q. I meant to ask you this all week, you talked about maybe not looking at scoreboards as much, at the PGA, at the 3M, next time you're in the mix do you think you'll be looking at the scoreboard?
ADAM HADWIN: No, probably not.  When I was as far back as I was this week it was always fun to take a peek and see.  But we'll see when that situation happens again, we'll see what develops.
