Q. Just talk about your round before heading into the final day?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, it was just, I mean, a little scrambly there at points.  I made a great save on 14 to kind of keep the round going and keep whatever momentum I might have had.  Made a bunch of par putts and you know, got it around at 3-under, so I'm happy and hopefully we can get some rhythm again tomorrow.
Q. How tough are those conditions out there today?
ADAM HADWIN: It was bouncing all over the place.  We had pockets of perfect play with no wind, and we had pockets of downpours.
You know, I'm just glad we got in the house before that wind kind of took off on us on 18.
Q. Will you be thinking about the Presidents Cup more tomorrow because it's the final day or will it remain status quo?
ADAM HADWIN: I think it will remain status quo.  I've grinded my butt off to keep it respectable this week.  That first round could have got away pretty quickly but I hung in there.  I hung in there again today.  I hit some squirrely shots, but short game has been great all week and putter stayed hot.
You know, I've got a chance going into tomorrow.  That's all you can ask for.
