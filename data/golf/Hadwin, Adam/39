Q. What was the story out there?
ADAM HADWIN: Certainly both Adam and I are disappointed.  Felt like I kind of let him down there early.  Had a couple fairly straightforward up and ins and made it a little bit too difficult there early.  Just couldn't really get any momentum, and when we did, you know, a nice birdie on 10; another one on 13, kind of get two back with five to go, and then, you know, kind of giving him one there again on 14.
So it was that kind of a day.  We just couldn't match up, and you know, unfortunately we're on the losing end of -- is it 5 & 3, I guess.
Q. How much of an issue was matching up the ball for you?  We heard some stories that perhaps that was a little more difficult than it might have seemed?
ADAM HADWIN: With Adam and I, it wasn't too bad.  We basically just did the old, he hit my ball off the tee when I was hitting the iron into the green, and vice versa.  Last night when the pairings came out, we had to figure it out.  Obviously we didn't play a practice round together.  Had not had a chance to play with each other's ball, but whether or not that played into it, I doubt it.  It was just more some poor execution when we needed it.
Q. How is the atmosphere in the team room last night and this morning?  What was it like?
ADAM HADWIN: I mean, certainly this morning, we were a little bit more upbeat.  We still had a chance to see if we can -- see if the guys can kind of flip these last couple matches and maybe get a couple points.  I guess there's always a chance still, as slim as it looks.  You know, we're just going to have to keep grinding and keep our heads down and one point at a time.
Q. Not the result that you had in mind today.  What happened out there?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, it was difficult between the two of us.  I certainly was not up to par, early, for sure.  We're both trying our hardest out there.  We're both trying to execute the shots.  Unfortunately today just wasn't our day.
Q. Nick Price said yesterday that there was probably a ball issue involving yourself; was that maybe a problem today?
ADAM HADWIN: I don't think so, not with Adam.  You know, we didn't play a practice round together, so I didn't hit his golf ball until we played today.  He hit my ball off the tee when I was going to hit an iron in and vice versa.  That certainly was not the issue.  It was just a lack of execution when I needed to hit some shots.
Q. Can you describe the emotions you're going through right now personally and as a team, also?
ADAM HADWIN: It's difficult.  You want to win so bad.  I got real fired up when I made the putt on 10 and I felt like it was kind of the start of a comeback for us, and another one on 13, we were only two back with five to play; we had a good chance.  You know, kind of giving a hole away on 14 and the air was let out of the sails a little bit.  It's extremely disappointing because you want to come out and showcase how good you are and play for the team, and of course not let your partner down, which I think is the hardest part.
It's two more matches I guess.  Whether or not I'm playing this afternoon, I still have a singles match on Sunday.  So just keep the head down and keep going, and grind through the rest of the week.
