  Q. Just your thoughts on your round today and how the course might have played differently today versus the first two rounds.
 ADAM HADWIN:   I'm honestly not sure what to think.  As I left my caddie there, he said, "pretty good playing to finish 1-under," and I kind of looked at him and said, "I have no idea how we ended up shooting 1-under today."  Honestly it kind of felt like I just woke up.  It was a bit of a whirlwind out there.  I hit it all over the place, putted it off the green like three times today.  One of those days.
 Q. Was the course playing different today than the first two days?
 ADAM HADWIN:   I don't think it was much.  The greens maybe just a hair firmer than they have been, but honestly, pretty similar wind to what we've seen the first two days, and I don't think it's much different.  I definitely saw a couple good scores out there.  Cam turned one in earlier.  I think it's out there if you hit good shots, but this course always has a way of sneaking up on you when you don't.
