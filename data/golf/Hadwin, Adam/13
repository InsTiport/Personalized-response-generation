 Q.  What a fight, an opportunity to get that full point there, but still, what a match.  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, it's a little disappointing. That's kind of what you work for, right, to have a putt on 18, to do that. Unfortunately hit it a little hard through the break. It was a battle to the end. Nobody really wanted to give in there, and kind of a fitting end for the way the match went today.   
You hate to say it, he kind of gave me that one on 17. Didn't hit a great shot from the fairway. I hit a great putt for birdie, but kind of put the pressure on him after the bunker shot.   
Like I said, kind of fitting the way that match went, and hopefully some guys can flip some things behind me and we can capture it.
