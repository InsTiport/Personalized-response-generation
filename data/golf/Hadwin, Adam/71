 Q.  Adam, a good day and a good week.  ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, after the start I got off to, 5-under through six, I thought today could be something special.  Getting off to a start like that is something that you sort of dream of, and I said to Joe walking down the fairway, I said, I feel good today.  Felt in the right frame of mind.  I was hitting the shots early and kind of got derailed on 7 and 8 there, and well, almost saved 7 from standing in the water there. But I really thought I made that putt.  It just kind of took off at the end.  Then bad drive on 8.  I was able to steady it from there.  I did a lot of good things on the back nine, just too many mistakes.  A three-putt on 12, and then poor tee shot, possibly a poor club choice on 14 led to a double.  But I think I made 7 birdies and an eagle today on a Sunday, and I was under par so can't be too upset.   Q.  What happened to the tee shot on 7?  ADAM HADWIN: It was just a poor swing.  I've been fighting right all week, and just got quick and ahead of it.  With the breeze coming back and in off the left, it just kept it going.  I was fortunate to be up, fortunate not to be in the drop zone.  So I had a chance, and I really hit an incredible recovery shot to just give myself a chance for par.  I just wasn't able to make it.   Q.  What were you allowing yourself to do when you were 6-under at that point?  Were you thinking I can be top 5 here?  ADAM HADWIN: No, I was thinking I can win it.  My goal was I was at 13-under at that point.  My goal was to try to get a couple more and be tied for the lead before Hearn even teed off. I played so well early.  I felt good with the putter, my lines were good, I was making putts and hitting it solid.  I really thought that I could kind of go out there and post a number.  I just got derailed.  I wasn't able to recover as quick as I should have.  But hit some good shots on the back, and just kind of, again, a little derailment there on 12 and 14.   Q.  You tweeted to Dave that you were going to pave the way for him today.  Were you actually trying to lull him into a sense of complacency?  ADAM HADWIN: No, no.  I think that was Nick's tweet, actually.  I didn't get my nap because of David playing yesterday, so I'll blame him for the poor back nine.   Q.  Another top 10 finish for you.  What's that mean for your season and your future?  ADAM HADWIN: Hopefully I stay in the top 10.  Obviously, 16 and 18 are still par-5s that are reachable for most of the guys, so we'll see what happens.  But I think the biggest thing, this may have locked up my card for this year. Obviously, coming to Canada we face a little extra pressure.  The crowds want us to do well.  To go out there and really bounce back after quite a terrible opening nine or opening 18, sorry, to bounce back. I played the last 54, 14-under, and to climb back in the top 10, I'm very happy.  I'm very pleased, and I think I can carry a lot of momentum into these next two weeks.   Q.  You going to watch David coming in?  ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I'm going to sit and eat something and watch him on the television and see what happens.  Hopefully he's right there or leading coming into the 18th.  We'll do what we did at the Greenbrier and hopefully bring him in.
