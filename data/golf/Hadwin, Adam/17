Q. 5-under 67 today; tell me about the round.
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, good solid round.  A lot of good-quality shots, had a lot of good looks into the greens.  Very solid into the greens, put myself in some really good spots, and I just made a few putts today.
Q. Was there a pivotal hole or pivotal save for you?
ADAM HADWIN: No, I wouldn't say that.  I hit a great shot into 17.  I birdied 16 to get to 4-under, and a couple rounds these last few weeks I've been in a similar position and just maybe one bad swing coming in and it turns a really solid round into kind of an average round.  So I hit -- it was nice to see a really good shot on 17, have a nice look for birdie and kind of one that surprises you a little bit on 18 going in there.
Q. 51st in the FedExCup standings, so this week is a big week for you.  Talk about how this round sets you up.
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, huge week.  Kind of go big or go home.  You've got to play well, most likely top 5 finish.  Puts me in a good position.  A lot of golf left to be played, but I certainly didn't play my way out of the chance to get to East Lake.
Q. How about Presidents Cup?  Is it in your mind at all?
ADAM HADWIN: Well, I think unfortunately the top 8, I'm so far back that I need to win a golf tournament to do it.  My focus is going to be to do that.  Obviously hopefully if I can go out and win, then I've got a chance to move inside of it.  We'll see.  Like I said, there's a lot of golf to be played.  If I can play my way into East Lake, I'll move up the Presidents Cup standings, as well.
