 Q.  Adam, I know not the best way you want to finish, but overall how do you put that in context for us?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I mean, another solid round obviously.  A lot fairways, a lot of greens; had some good looks.  Few putts didn't go if today, but two eagles in a round never happens very often.   
Yeah, I mean, we're still in the mix going into the weekend.  That's the main goal.   
 Q.  You said yesterday that you felt confident after your round in part because you felt like you could have shot even better.  Does that continue to be the feeling, that you have rounds that you can build off?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, certainly.  It's getting really close to chasing down a 61 or 60 like Mack did this morning, and even Ben Silverman.  Just a matter of a few more putts dropping.   
Hit it really solid again today.  Couple missed shots here and there, but those are always going to happen during the round.  Got up and down nicely.  Looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  Everyone talks about how they love playing in front of the Canadian crowds.  I get the sense you love playing in front of big crowds in general.  Is that accurate?  Would you rather be playing in front of 10,000 people than 20?  Is that energizing?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, I think it's a fair assessment.  You know, I certainly don't have a marquee name like some of the guys out here who have crowds every week.  Usually when I play in front of crowds I'm playing well or I'm at a really big event.   
That gets you up a little bit more I think and like you said gets you a little bit more energized and you feed off it a little bit.  I'm just playing really good golf right now.  That's what it comes down to.  I feel confident and comfortable out there.  Just a matter of picking some shots and executing.
