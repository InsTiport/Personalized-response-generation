  Q. Really putted well.  You had one hundred feet ten inches in putts.
 ADAM HADWIN:   Thank you.  I didn't know.  Yeah, I rolled a couple nice ones in there to start.  Got a nice little roll there in the middle of the back nine, too.  Certainly a course where you can make plenty of birdies, and we'll see where it finishes at the end of the day.
 I'm sure I won't be leading for long.  Yeah, nice little Saturday moving day, and hopefully have a chance tomorrow.
 Q. Capped off that birdie run as well with an eagle on the 16th.  You were 10-under par on the nine par-5s you've played.
 ADAM HADWIN:   That's usually pretty good, isn't it?  Especially for a guy that's not known to be one of the longest either.  You know, taking advantage.  Hitting good shots.  I rolled it pretty decent first couple days; just didn't make as much.
 Again, it's just a matter of continually just put yourself in play, give yourself a chance.  Typically these desert courses, whoever putts the best is going to win, and I was able to do that today.
 Q. Speaking of desert courses, you have a 59 to your name at the America Express.  Does that make you more comfortable when you get into the low 60s and flirt with another round in the 50s?
 ADAM HADWIN:   It's going to do nothing but help for sure.  Yeah, I mean, the other thing here you is just -- I mean, I'm playing catchup making the cut on the number at 7-under.  You fully expect guys to get into the low 20s, low 20s today by the end of it.
 I had to keep the pedal on the floor and keep going and get as many as I can, and hopefully get as close to the leaders by the end of the day as possible.
