Q. Pretty strong start to the tournament, 12 through 16, you had some highs of the round and some lows.  What was happening on those holes?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, there was a lot of highs and lows today.  I hit some good shots coming in, but I didn't have a swing this morning.  I didn't have any feel for the game of golf.  Kind of battled my way through.  Made a mess of 14.  Got it back on 15 and 16.
But it was a day to just try and hang in there, hopefully find some rhythm.  I did that a little bit, and then kind of pooped myself kind of finishing there.
Q. Was there a lot of wind in the valley?  Was that an issue at all?
ADAM HADWIN: No, just poor play.  Just didn't hit golf shots.
