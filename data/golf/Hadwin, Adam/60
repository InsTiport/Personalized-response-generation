 Q.  Give us your thoughts on your week in general.  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, it's a disappointing week.  Obviously you want to come here to Canada, play well.  I had my moments of brilliance and some moments of, you know, maybe I should be an amateur again.  But played a little bit better on the back nine today, which was nice.  Started hitting a few better shots and it was nice to make a couple putts there at the end.   
 Q.  You spoke about this week -- is there added pressure being home as a Canadian?  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, of course there is.  Not a day goes by or a minute goes by that the media doesn't mention it to us that we haven't won yet.  When you constantly have people telling you and reminding you of the fact that we haven't won in 50, 60 years, 62 years now, yes, there is an added pressure.   
But it's also a lot of fun to play in front of the fans.  They are so good.  They are so supportive.  They really just want to see you do well at the end of the day.  But yeah, there's some added pressure.   
 Q.  How are the conditions?  They have been a story this week.  Is it softening up at all today or is it just as hard as it was yesterday?  
ADAM HADWIN: No, I think it's softening up a lot.  I think the greens slowed down a little bit today, as well.  There's some good pin locations, but you know, a couple guys went out early, shot 63.  There's not a lot of breeze.  I think you're going to have to shoot a number today to win it.
