Q. Adam Hadwin, 6 under, 66, in the second round.  Talk about your day.
ADAM HADWIN: It was just a real solid day.  I've been hitting it well the last couple of days.  I just didn't make as many putts yesterday.  Got some good momentum going early, made some good putts.  I got under par early, and I got some good breaks on the back nine.
I had one, I hit it on 13, I think -- I hit it, punched it underneath the trees, kind of caught the rough by the green, sent it straight left and went to three feet.  So that was one I wasn't necessarily thinking birdie, but I squeaked out a couple there on the back.  It wasn't as good as the front, but 6 under at the end of the day.
Q. If the course was ripe for scoring yesterday, what was it today?
ADAM HADWIN: Obviously, scoring, I think, is going to continue to be low.  Greens are still fairly receptive.  They are getting firmer, but they're pretty pure.  We've got some pure greens this morning.  A little bit different than yesterday afternoon.  They got a little bumpy toward the end.  But really good greens to make putts.  Good speed to make putts right now as well.  They're not too quick either.
