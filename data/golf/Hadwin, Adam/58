 Q.  Over that last putt, what were you thinking?  
ADAM HADWIN: Well, it was funny I walked off 17 I said to my caddie, Joe, thereâs a lot more people than when we teed off.   
I was shaking, I really was. I knew what was at stake. And the last thing you want to do is miss a three-footer, but it went in.
