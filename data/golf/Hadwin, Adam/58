Q. Can you tell us a little bit about that round today?  How did it feel?
ADAM HADWIN: Playing pretty well and then kind of struggled coming down the stretch.  I didn't think I hit the putt, the first putt, that hard on 15.  Blew it down the hill.  Couldn't get it backup.  So disappointing there.
I had a chance to bounce back on 16.  Missed a close one.  Just kind of hacked my way in from there.
Q. When you have a round like that, what do you do?  How do you relax and cool down?
ADAM HADWIN: It's going to take a little time.  A little heated right now.  A little upset.  It's extremely disappointing.  I was playing well, hitting it well, making a few putts.  Just kind of let it all slip away.
I'm going to need about 14 birdies tomorrow.  That's my plan.
Q. Did you find that the fairways are getting harder, softer?  Are they improving at all?
ADAM HADWIN: I don't know.  I think the course is playing pretty similar right now.  Slightly different breeze, so there's a couple holes that -- 18 might even be a little tougher to hit now because it's more downbreeze and more off the left.
I don't know, just disappointed coming in.
Q. Is there an element of guessing because how hard the greens are?
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah.  There's a huge amount of guessing.  The breeze is kicking up and laying down.  If you pick the wrong time to hit, you can send it over the back of the green pretty easily, or come up 15 yards short pretty easily.  You're trying to pick a spot because you know it's going to bounce on the greens and if the wind doesn't cooperate, it's not hitting that spot.
