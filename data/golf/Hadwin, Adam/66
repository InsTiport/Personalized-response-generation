 Q.  Obviously not the result you wanted, but still a lot of support out there for you.  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, no, I'm pretty disappointed, being in a share of the lead going into the back nine and just not being able to execute and get the job done, it's disappointing.  But it's a lot to build on, a lot to move forward on.  And it was great to get a birdie in front of all the fans there on the last hole.   
 Q.  You had the loudest cheers on the starting tee this morning.  What does that say about the Canadians here?  
ADAM HADWIN: Well, the fans in Canada are so good.  There's only four of us out here, so they kind of cheer for every Canadian no matter where we're from.  So it's great to have that much support and it's nice to have a good week in front of them, I wish I could have been a couple shots lower though.
