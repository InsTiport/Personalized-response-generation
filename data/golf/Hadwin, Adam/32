 Q.  A 65 today, what was the key to your round today?  
ADAM HADWIN: I made some putts today.  That was the biggest thing.  It was a bit of a shaky start but it was a bit of a shaky start.  I missed the first three greens, but some great up-and-downs from the bunker.   
Made some good putts to kind of get things rolling, and then I just hit some good iron shots in the middle stretch there, and like I say, made a boatload of putts there, which it was nice to see because I haven't seen that happen in a while.   
 Q.  We're through two rounds.  This is obviously an important tournament, as you try and reach THE TOUR Championship again.  How important is it to get to THE TOUR Championship for you and just comment on that.  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, it's huge.  Having experienced it once already, being able to plan a schedule around majors and WGCs for the following year is big.  Playing against the best players in the world every week and knowing that you're there, truly feeling like you're one of the best players in the world.  You get to THE TOUR Championship, you've had a pretty good year, and that's what we are all shooting for.   
Anything can happen in the Playoffs with the points, so one good week here or in Boston could set me up for THE TOUR Championship.  So I just have to keep going and firing birdies and hopefully the putts continue to drop.
