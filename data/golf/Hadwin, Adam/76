 Q.   Were conditions getting tougher near the end of the round?  
ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, you know, wind is swirling a little bit, obviously picking up a little bit, as well. Golf course is just‑‑ it's got a tough finish, period. 16 you've got to hit two quality golf shots, same with 18, and then 17 is a little bit shorter but it's no picnic in that back right. Fortunately I was able to come out of those three even par.  
   
 Q.   A lot of pins seemed to be tucked in sort of spots today. Coming in with a short iron it's not a big deal, but it's a little trickier with the wind?   
ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, you know, I thought the golf course was set up well. It was set up well to score. Obviously the greens still aren't that firmed out. You can fly it to most of them and stop it, and I think you could see some low scores for sure. I had plenty of opportunities on the front nine to do that and just didn't capitalize on them.  
   
 Q.   How do you approach tomorrow?   
ADAM HADWIN:   You just go out and have some fun, sort of like I've approached it all week. You know, my biggest thing this week has just been committing to targets and being confident with golf shots, and so far this week I haven't‑‑ I can maybe think of one golf shot in three rounds where I sort of came up and out of a shot. Everything else has been exactly what I've tried to do. So just continue to do that and let the chips fall where they may.  
   
 Q.   When you mentioned having fun, how much fun is this tournament because it's so rare for you guys with so much pressure, but yet it's so rare for you to get the chance‑‑  
ADAM HADWIN:   Well, it's been rare for me the last few years. Obviously this is the only event I've come back and played, and obviously it's a lot more fun coming up to the PGA TOUR and having an event out here, as well, playing the Web.com the last three years. It's a lot of fun playing in front of Canadian fans. They're great golf fans. They're golf hungry as I always say. They want to see us do well, and it's always nice to play well in front of them.
