Q.   Talk about your round today.   You got to 6‑under.   You've got to be pretty excited?
    ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, absolutely.   Monday qualified in, and just to have the opportunity to play here, it's really exciting.   To go out and shoot a bogey‑free 66 to start the week, I couldn't ask for anything more. 
    I'm hitting it well and just keep playing my game, and I'm playing well.   I thought that both courses suited my game coming into this week, and I just need to kind of just go out and play smart golf and see what happens.

Q.   You've been knocking on the door of earning your card the last couple years.   What are your plans the early part of the year?   Are you playing Monday qualifiers, sponsor invites? 
    ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, obviously, my manager's working as hard as he can to get me into events.   It's very difficult now with taking away a few spots to give to some of the Q‑School guys to make sure they get in fields and that sort of thing. 
    But I'm going to work hard and do some Mondays on the west coast here.   (Indiscernible) but Phoenix and Northern Trust, and then our schedule, so it's kicking off down in South America.   So just using the Mondays as a bit of a warm‑up for the year, and we'll get going on the Web.com Tour.

Q.   What about tomorrow?   You're on a different course that's a little harder.   You've played it, obviously, in the practice round. 
    ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, I've played ten holes.   I only saw 9 through 18.   Didn't quite have time to get in the rough being a Monday qualifier this week.   You know, it's going to be, obviously, it usually plays much more difficult.   So you just kind of keep it in play and keep it in front of you and hopefully make a few putts like I did today.
