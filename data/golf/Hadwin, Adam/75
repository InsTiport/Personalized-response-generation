 Q.   Kind of recap having a bunch of Canadians make the weekend here and having all those guys in the mix.   
ADAM HADWIN:   Yeah, today was a lot of fun playing with Brad and obviously him playing very well and seeing him in contention and coming so close down the stretch to getting a couple more.   We were rooting each other on.   Obviously when six guys can make the cut at the Canadian Open here and get up there, DeLaet playing well, Fritsch playing well today, it's great to see.   The future is bright, and it's just a lot of fun to come up and play.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel about your game?  
ADAM HADWIN:   I didn't play very well today.   It was hit and miss all day.   I hit some good shots and made a couple putts and then couldn't get some putts to drop on the back and a couple bad tee shots coming in there on 18.   Disappointing not to make that putt for par on the last, but that's golf.   We move on, and got next week to worry about.
