 Q.  Adam, some comments on your round today if we can.  
ADAM HADWIN: Yeah, obviously the putter went cold on me.  I didn't hit it any worse or better than I had the first three days.  I just didn't make the putts I needed to and unfortunately I shot over par, but I think there's some silver lining that comes with the round.   
 Q.  Looks like you're very likely to be on The Presidents Cup team.  Just comment on what that means to you.  
ADAM HADWIN: It's huge.  I've been speaking about it all week; that it's been in the forefront of my mind.  Like I said, I'm disappointed to not play well on Sunday (Monday), but, I came out here and did what I needed to do.  At least it seems like that, any ways, right now.   
You never know, the World Ranking points are a bit weird at teams.  But I came out here and played well and put myself in a position to win a golf tournament.  I didn't get it done, but it's been a great season so far.  I think I'm kind of locked up for TOUR Championship now, which means a great deal to be able to plan a schedule next year.   
You know, again, hopefully everything works out and I'm in The Presidents Cup in three weeks, as well.   
 Q.  I don't know if you watch leaderboards, but if you do, and you saw what Justin was doing and Jordan, and even Marc Leishman, do you have to do a double-take, as low as they went?  
ADAM HADWIN: You'd love to say that you don't because you expect it, but when you start going 5- , 6-under through seven, eight holes, it's very impressive.   
Obviously there's a bunch of guys earlier this morning before we even came out to the golf course that were doing it:  Harold Varner; Jason Day got it going, as well.  So you knew it was out there.   
I said to my caddie, Joe, I figured somebody was probably going to shoot 6- to 8-under for sure.  And unfortunately I just couldn't get the ball in the hole as quickly as I did the first three days today.
