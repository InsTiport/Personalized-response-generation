  ROD PERRY:   Real tough.   They have got four par‑5s, basically at 500 yards or just a little bit longer.   That is awfully tough.   I think into 16, after a good tee ball for me, I had 253 to the hole.   So that's just a really tough hole for me.   
17, was fortunate to make par there after having quite a bit of ways in.   And then 2.   So those four par‑5s are just really, really tough, especially for a player like me.   Didn't play them very well.   
Made a couple other mistakes, too.   I don't make enough birdies to make up for them.   
Plus 3 yesterday, plus 4 today, plus 7.   Obviously disappointed to miss the cut.   That's always the goal.   The goal is to play good quality golf, whatever that is.   Didn't quite get that done this week.
