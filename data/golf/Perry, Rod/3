Q.   Two rough holes with double‑bogeys and you bounced back with birdies to close.   Wanted to get a feel today of your tour around Valhalla?
ROD PERRY:   It was like eating desert after a bad meal.   No, made a long putt on 17 and got up‑and‑down on 18, so just have to eliminate the mistakes.   I don't make enough birdies to bounce back from that many mistakes and I certainly don't make enough birdies to bounce back from that many double‑bogeys.
Tomorrow try to tighten things up.   Realistically I can shoot 3, 4‑under on this golf course to stick around and play on the weekend.

Q.   How was your driving? 
ROD PERRY:   Sporadic.   I'm spooky short now.   I hit in the center clubface and hitting it really well but every now and then I'm miss‑hitting some tee balls.   Went in the water on 15. 

Q.   What happened on 2? 
ROD PERRY:   2, kind of a bad tee ball over to the right, right rough, bad lay up in the rough, and then just a terrible wedge coming out of the rough, as well, in the bunker and that left bunker has no sand, extremely firm, went over the green and got up‑and‑down for double.   I can't be that sloppy.

Q.   They are expecting rain tomorrow, so the biggest thing, can you keep it in the fairway? 
ROD PERRY:   I have to hit it in the fairway.   I don't hit it long enough to score out of the rough.   Some of these guys do, they have so much power, but I have to put the ball in the center of the greens.   You have to make some putts to give yourself some opportunities.
