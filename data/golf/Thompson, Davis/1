Q. Davis Thompson here.  Talk to me a little bit about your first U.S. Open experience.
DAVID THOMPSON:   It was awesome.  I just got off to a bad start today, and I never really got it back today.  It was just awesome.  Winged Foot is such a historic place, and to have my first U.S. Open here is really special.
Q. What were your emotions like yesterday?  You had the lead for a little bit.  Talk to me about that.
DAVID THOMPSON:   Yeah, it was really fun.  I kept hitting fairways and hitting greens and making putts.  It was kind of going pretty smoothly.  Yeah, at least I can brag to my friends that I had the lead in the U.S. Open for a little bit.
Q. Overall, a different summer for everyone, but how would you evaluate your playing experiences this summer?
DAVID THOMPSON:   I'd say pretty good.  I'd probably give myself a B-plus.  Still got a lot of work to do my last year at Georgia, and I'm just excited to get back with my teammates.  Maybe, hopefully, the cut will drop back to 7 over, so we'll see.
Q. Anything else that you think you're going to take away from the past two days?
DAVID THOMPSON:   It's just a big learning experience for me.  Just trying to take everything I learned this week going forward, and I think that will really help me out in the future.
