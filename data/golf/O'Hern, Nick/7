 Q. First of all, congratulations. Great round today. 
 NICK O'HERN: Thank you. Thank you.

 Q. If I could just get your thoughts on your round. Were there any highlights that kept you going? Anything that really stuck out in your mind?
 NICK O'HERN: I really struck the ball beautifully. I never made a bogey, so six birdies on the day. I think from 8 through 11 I made four in a row, so I got to 6-under through 11 and the round was going good. Then I made pars on the last seven, so that was a little deflating. But I'll take 6-under. I was very happy. 

 Q. Yeah. Very good. With that round, you move up the leaderboard. Does that change strategy or anything, mindset? 
 NICK O'HERN: Not really. I just think come Sunday we'll have a look at where we are position-wise. We're probably running third or fourth at the moment, so that's in a real good spot. 
 Good, solid round tomorrow, and hopefully we've got a chance in the last round on Sunday.

 Q. Comments about your year, any highlights. 
 NICK O'HERN: Last week was good because that sort of got me out of the 125 race. I had a good week last week, which means I wasn't stressing too much this week. 
 It's been a long year. I've been coming back from injuries, so I'm pretty pleased with how it's gone. It's been a bit of a hard slog, but I've got a job for next year, so that's always good.
