Q.  You finished 66 last week to grab fifth position, and you've gone even better today?
NICK O'HERN:  Yeah, 64 is a nice way to finish.  Unfortunately I was just so far back that it's probably a little bit late for me to win the golf tournament, but Sundays are quite good to me.  I just need to get in the right position going in.
Q.  I understand it could have even been a lot lower than where it was.
NICK O'HERN:  It was one of those days where I just had it on a bit of a string.  I actually bogeyed the first, and from then on I just played really good golf.  And I think I only had to save the par by getting up and down on one hole, and the rest I was looking at birdies or eagles the rest of the day.  I putted nicely, so 8 under around here I'm certainly pleased with.
Q.  You've teed it up in seven starts and you have four Top 5 finishes; that's pretty hot stuff.
NICK O'HERN:  I'm doing all right.  I just need that victory, though.  I'm playing well enough to do it.  This week, yesterday just killed me, unfortunately, 76.  It was tough out there.

You know, I think if I can get in that position come Sunday, I think I'll be all right.
Q.  Just a matter of time, isn't it?
NICK O'HERN:  Seems that way.
