   NICK O'HERN:  You know, that's golf.  I hit the ball as well as I could pretty much all day.  Only a couple of things -- but when you're playing well, you feel like you can hole it from the fairway.  I hit a lot of good shots today, a lot of good putts, but that's golf.  A shame to 3-putt last but I figured well may as well give it a run and see if I can get close.   
  
  Q.  You're known as the Tiger slayer beating in the Match Play; something like this maybe gets you a little bit more Americanized?   
 NICK O'HERN:  I can't yeah, sure I watched some of the coverage today and I've been around for a little while now and I probably just don't get the publicity some guys get and I'm quite happy with that.  It's pretty cool.  But you play good golf, everything else is going to come with it.   
  
  Q.  Where do you go after this week?   
 NICK O'HERN:  Pretty good schedule coming up and the majors and the FedExCup, so I'm playing well.  I think the courses we're playing pretty much suit my game so hopefully we can get a win or two.
