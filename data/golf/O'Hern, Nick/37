   NICK O'HERN:  2-up with two to play, I thought I was in good shape.  I didn't hit the ball well at all today, but just my short game kept the round going, which is what it's all about.  You've just got to keep going when you're not hitting the ball well.   
 You know, if I would have given myself a chance to make birdie on the last; tee shot missed the fairway by a couple of yards and just had a horrible lie.  But if I had a wedge in my hand, I might have had a chance.  I wasn't really expecting him to make eagle, but as they say, expect the unexpected.   
  
  Q.  A tough one.   
 NICK O'HERN:  It is.  Considering the way I played today, I shot a pretty good score because I hit the ball terrible to be honest.  But that's what the short game is for, anyways.  It's pretty frustrating.
