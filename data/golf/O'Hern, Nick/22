   NICK O'HERN:  I hit the ball lovely all day, had a bit of a lull there in the middle of the round there where I got on the bogey train a little bit, but had a good finish.  I'm enjoying 16 at the moment.  I keep birdieing that hole, three days in a row.  The crowd was out of control, so it was a lot of fun out there.   
  
  Q.  Could you tell that it was a record crowd?   
 NICK O'HERN:  Oh, pretty much, yeah.  This is the first time I've been here, so this is double anything I've ever seen in my life.  They're very enthusiastic.   
  
  Q.  Sort of the nerves getting to you on 16?   
 NICK O'HERN:  No, I love the hole.  I've birdied it every day.  It's so noisy there that it doesn't matter if they yell or not because it's all a bit of a blur, so you just focus on your shot.   
  
  Q.  How is the course playing in terms of wetness?  Has it dried out?   
 NICK O'HERN:  Yeah, it's dried out nicely.  Played pretty short today with the warm weather, although the last couple holes, the cloud cover came over and it got very cold so the ball started going nowhere again.  But I think tomorrow should be another nice day.   
  
  Q.  The greens are firming up, though?   
 NICK O'HERN:  Exactly, yeah.  The greens are firm.  If you putt well, you can hole putts.  You can shoot a good score.  You'll need somewhere probably 16-, 17-under to win it, I'd say.
