NICK O'HERN:  Played well again but putter went cold unfortunately. It was a pleasing week though. I made three bogeys on the par threes today, didn't get up and down each time. It was very costly. It's hard to get the momentum going if you make bogeys.

Played solidly all week and I'm pleased but wished I had played better today. I gave it all my 100 percent, but shot a 73 which was the best that I could shoot.
