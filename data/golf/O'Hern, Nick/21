 Q.  So another good win.  Are you ready to just change every tournament to match play? 
 NICK O'HERN:  Yeah, it seems to suit me pretty well.  I just like the format.  I played it a lot as a kid growing up, and you know, you don't have to out-power people, you just have to out-think them, really.  Today I just played really solid, didn't make any mistakes and didn't give Scott much of a chance to get in the match. 

 Q.  Interesting you mentioned not having to out-power the guys.  If there's one guy you would say is more of a thinker than an out-powerer, it's Scott Verplank.  It's kind of playing against someone a lot like yourself today.  Was that different? 
 NICK O'HERN:  It was a very similar match-up, yeah.  But one thing I always make a point of early is to get ahead.  I did that early with a birdie on the 2nd.  Generally if I can get a lead, I tend not to let it go. 
 I knew Scott -- he basically had to make birdies to beat me, and even then it wasn't good enough.  I just played really nice golf, and it would have been tough for anyone to beat me today. 

 Q.  A couple of guys have mentioned that kind of getting that first win in match play might be sometimes even harder than winning the next two or three.  Like once you get the first one you can get on a roll? 
 NICK O'HERN:  Well, you kind of find a rhythm.  It's completely different than normal stroke play.  Sometimes you're not quite sure how to play the match, and sometimes you get caught up in a stroke play, whereas you shouldn't be; you should be very much about playing the man.  I think once you learn that through that first game, and if you can get through that then all of a sudden you're in that mode.  It almost -- doesn't get easier, but it seems to be a little bit simpler.
