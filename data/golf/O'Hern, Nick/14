  Q. Nick, just a couple thoughts about your 4-under 68 today.   
 NICK O'HERN: Great play. I never played these courses before, so -- and I heard the Palm Course is the one to go low on, although with the weather the way it is, I think 4-under was really good. Maybe last year it was about average, but yeah, it was playing really long out there. And I hit the ball great, putted nice.   
 They're really tricky greens to read. I found the grain going in all different directions on some of the holes, so all in all 4-under is great.  
  
  Q. Any highlights to your round, any good saves?  
 NICK O'HERN: I think my second nine I had three birdies in a row, par 67, and I think 6 is a tough hole on that course, and it's pretty intimidating over the water. So I was really pleased I had good drives (indiscernible).  
  
  Q. Okay. Can you just maybe give me a synopsis of your year.   
 NICK O'HERN: It's been steady. Not the year I was hoping for, but I -- end of last year I had some injuries which I had surgery on, and I just thought I'd get right back on the horse and sort of get back where I was, but reality kicked in and it's not that easy, unless you're Tiger Woods, I guess (laughs).   
 But as far as my game, I think I've made really decent progress, pushing down in my golf swing. I think I'm swinging as good as I have, but my results just haven't shown it, so all in all I've been happy with the year but not result wise. It's been a solid year, but I think 2010 will be really, really good.   
  
  Q. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
