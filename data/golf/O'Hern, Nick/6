  Q. How was it out on the golf course today?  
 NICK O'HERN: A little tougher. The greens were certainly quicker. Good couple of feet on most putts, 10, 12 feet. So I really didn't play very well. I hit the ball pretty ordinary, but got a little luck, so I was very happy.   
  
  Q. What do you feel you have to do in tomorrow's final round?  
 NICK O'HERN: What's leading?   
  
  Q. 14-under is leading.   
 NICK O'HERN: I'm a couple back. You know, I think the key is really to get well under par before you reach 16. Those last three holes are really tough.   
 You know, tomorrow I have a feeling 17, 18-under would be a really good mark. I'd take 16 at this stage, but you never know what's going to happen.  
  
  Q. You're still looking for your first win on the PGA TOUR. You're close. Are you thinking about stuff like that, and heading into tomorrow's round is that something you'll think about?  
 NICK O'HERN: Not particularly, no. I'm just trying to win the golf tournament, whether it's the first or 20th I've won. Doesn't really make too much difference. I'm just trying to play good golf.   
 Thankfully I got the 125 mark out of the way last week, playing well at the McGladrey because it would have been a very stressful week if I was still looking at that. So I'm thankful I'm in contention. And it's a home game for me. I'm only 10 or 15 minutes away. I can sleep in my own bed, and to win in front of my family would be fantastic.   
  
  Q. Well, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.   
 NICK O'HERN: All right. Thank you.
