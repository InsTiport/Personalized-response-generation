 Q.  How did the course play? 
 NICK O'HERN:  I actually played pretty good.  Played very tough.  Played well.  Putted beautifully. 
 Because the greens are a lot quicker, there are breaks you can't see. 
 It's a very difficult golf course.  At the end of the day my score doesn't look too bad. 
 Had about 3-putts today that stopped on the lip. 
 The greens are firm.  They have been firm before, but not like this. 
 If it's windy this afternoon the greens will be impossible. 
 A few of the holes I couldn't read the greens. 
 Number five I couldn't hold the green.
