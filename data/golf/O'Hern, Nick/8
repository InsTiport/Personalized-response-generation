 Q. When you got to the 14th tee today, did you know your tees would be up where you guys would have a chance to go for the green?
 NICK O'HERN: No, no. We walked on in, and the first thing my caddie said was it was fantastic. It was a great job by the tournament to give us the opportunity. 
 I just set up perfectly there for a draw 3-wood from there, and I just ripped one and made two. 

 Q. Overpowering the golf course as always. You made two there and had a good look at 18 as well. 
 NICK O'HERN: Yeah, I'm usually cranking about 305, so -- not. (Laughing.) 
 No, I had a good look at 18 but just pulled it a little bit. But I played well after that. I was scratching it around and had a pretty ordinary start, but hung in there. 
 Then I (indiscernible) on the back, and I think I shot 5-under on the back. So I've got a good shot tomorrow. 

 Q. You do indeed.
