 Q.  Talk a little bit about your round. 
 NICK O'HERN:  Very solid, really.  I kind of came out this morning and made three bogeys in a row to finish my first round, so that wasn't very good.  But I knew I was playing well, and it's just a matter of committing to what you're trying to do. 
 If you're playing well, eventually the results will come and I had a really good back round, so 6-under this afternoon was nice. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 NICK O'HERN:  It was really nice to get in the field, for one.  It's always nice when you play in these world golf events.  Match Play is a whole different ballgame, as we know.  I've had a pretty good record there.  I can't get past the quarterfinals.  I've been to the quarterfinals three times, which is nice, still pretty good results in Match Play because you can get knocked out at an early stage, but hopefully we can go a little bit deeper this year. 

 Q.  Is it desert golf maybe that you like? 
 NICK O'HERN:  Tucson is not far from here.  I love to play here.  I don't know, the courses seem to fit my eye really well here.  Maybe it's just trying to stay out of the cactus is a big thing. 

 Q.  How was the reception on 16 out there today? 
 NICK O'HERN:  Good.  First time I've played this tournament.  I've heard all about it.  There's some unusual cheers.  You hear things that you wouldn't get normally.  But it definitely makes you concentrate, and I've birdied it both days so I love the hole. 

 Q.  What do you get?  Do they cheer for you? 
 NICK O'HERN:  Well, obviously with my Match Play record they yell out a couple of things with regard to that.  But the old Aussie, Aussie, Aussie chant goes up every now and then, but it's all good fun.
