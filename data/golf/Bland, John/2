Q.
Congratulations.  A very nice 65.  Just a couple thoughts about your round.  Sonya said you left a couple out there.
JOHN BLAND:  Yeah, but this is pretty good on this golf course after the wind as blown it was nice to play, after we were blown to pieces the first two days, it was nice to play it.  I got off to quite a nice start.  And went out in 4 under, 32.  Got a few good birdie start at the first hole.  And I hit went out in 32 and then just came back nicely.  And I left one or two out there, but was quite happy with the way I played.
Q.  Any key shots?  Were you close to bogey at any hole?
JOHN BLAND:  No.
Q.  Which is pretty amazing, given the first two days.
JOHN BLAND:  No, I wasn't close to    I wasn't in any real trouble that I could really    I kept it on the fairways and put it on the greens and all that sort of thing.  But it was nice to play the course.  It's a wonderful golf course.  And it's just nice to play it.

And no three of us were really in any serious trouble, because you can get into a lot of trouble out there.
Q.  Now you mentioned to me a couple weeks ago you had been here before.  Do you remember the last time you were here and what you played in?
JOHN BLAND:  I was asking the pro if it was around about 1990 or something like that over here.  But it was a rainy, blustery day as well, you know.  It was under umbrellas and all that.  But that was a long, long time ago.  But I remembered    there's two new holes on the course, but it's a wonderful old golf course.
