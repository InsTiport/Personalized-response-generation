 Q.  Six birdies on the back nine.  What started working so well?  
EUN HEE JI: Actually I struggled with my tee shots on first couple holes, but I recover pretty good with my irons.   
So that makes it a little bit more easy to make birdies.  So, yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  Anything change on the back nine?  
EUN HEE JI: No, not really.  Actually my tee shot was a little bit better, so I keep it fairways more.   
Just hit it well today.   
 Q.  Did you think you're going to be able to get six birdies on the back nine?  
EUN HEE JI: No, no, no.  Not at all.   
 Q.  What do you think the state of your game is?  What's your form right now?  
EUN HEE JI: Actually my putting feel really good right now.  I think that's the key for this week.  It didn't wind today, but it's going to wind maybe later this weekend, so I have to putt it well, I think.   
 Q.  Is this a course you're comfortable on?  
EUN HEE JI: Actually, not really because always windy out here.  But today was no wind and this course is -- a lot of changes if no winds, so that makes it little easier today.   
 Q.  Surprise you there was no wind?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, yeah.  Actually, yes.   
 Q.  So have you had a chance to go out and explore the island?  Anything that you really like to do here in Hawaii?  
EUN HEE JI: This is my 11th, 12 year, so not trying to go out anything.  But when I come here always really relaxed out here and enjoy the food out here.  Yeah, just really good out here.   
 Q.  Birdie on the par-3, 12?  
EUN HEE JI: I think so.   
 Q.  Do you know how long that putt was?  
EUN HEE JI: Like seven feet, seven eight feet.  5-iron.  Yes.  Actually 6-iron.   
 Q.  Is that a hole that plays a lot differently if there is some wind?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.  Actually on this hole I always hit it low shot because always coming into.  I think it's a little bit harder for me because I have to hit it 5-iron or hybrid on that tee shot.   
6-iron is much easier, yeah.   
 Q.  What's the approach going into tomorrow with the score you put up today?  
EUN HEE JI: Just working on my tee shot because I was struggle.  Just focusing on my putting I think.  Yeah.   
 Q.  How did you struggle with the tee shots?  Length?  
EUN HEE JI: I hit it left.  Actually I hit it fading all the time, so if I hit it left I really struggle.  Just couple holes I hit it like that.  Switch something on my swing and just fix it a little bit better.   
 Q.  Just the first two holes?  
EUN HEE JI: Maybe three holes.   
 Q.  When happened, did you think, oh, my gosh, this is going to be a bad day?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, but my iron shot was fine.  Just tee shot wasn't that good.  Just focusing on it.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Was there any concern, panic?  
EUN HEE JI: No, not really.  Yeah.   
 Q.  What did you do last week?  
EUN HEE JI: I stay in L.A. and I just practice with my coach.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Do anything fun in L.A.?  
EUN HEE JI: Enjoying Korean food because there is big Korean Town.  So I go every night.  Yeah, just all that.   
 Q.  Having Korean food in Hawaii?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  What's your favorite?  
EUN HEE JI: Korean food?  Everything.   
 Q.  Call your coach and talk about your...  
EUN HEE JI: Probably later, yeah.  Later.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
EUN HEE JI: I don't know.  Just do it.   
 Q.  (Regarding equipment used on 18.)  
EUN HEE JI: Control 7-iron.   
 Q.  How long was the...  
EUN HEE JI: 140-something.   
 Q.  Okay.  How long was the last shot, the putt?  
EUN HEE JI: Putting, like three meter, yeah.   
 Q.  That's another hole that's different when the wind is not here?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, because always downwind here so I couldn't hold the -- my second shot all the time, but today wasn't that wind and I can hold it a little bit better.   
 Q.  What would you normally hit there?  
EUN HEE JI: It depends, because on the tee I have to think about the downwind, and I then get a short club and sometimes I laying back too far.  So I hit it longer.  That's why I couldn't hold it sometimes.  Yeah, that makes a lot different today.   
 Q.  7-iron to about three meters and then...  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.
