 Q.  Well, you came close.  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.   
 Q.  Were you aware where you were in the last nine holes?  Did you watch the scoreboard?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, I watch every time actually.   
 Q.  You've had a very successful year; got another win earlier.  Just tell me how you felt about your season.  
EUN HEE JI: I mean, I changed my swing a little bit and that won't work a lot.  Like this week I didn't swinging well, but I made a lot of putts from the like outside of 15 feet.  So that makes a lot of good score, I think.   
 Q.  Finish at 12 or 13?  
EUN HEE JI: 13.   
 Q.  So right now leader in the clubhouse I think.  Lowest score right now that's finished.  
EUN HEE JI: Oh, yeah, yeah, finished.   
 Q.  So did you feel like you would be in this position at the start of the week?  
EUN HEE JI: No, I didn't know that.  I mean, I'm trying what I work on.  I'm just trying, you know, just to play my best every shot.  No, I didn't know hitting that well.  Yeah, I'm hitting great.   
 Q.  Did you make a lot of putts today?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, I did, but I missed a lot of putts, too.  I made two bogeys with three-putt, so...   
 Q.  What are you going to do if for some reason you have to come back out in a little bit?  
EUN HEE JI: If I have to come back out, last hole's pretty tough for me because too long like distance-wise.   
Like I just made par on the last hole.  I think par is good score for 18 so I tried to make a par.   
 Q.  But there is a lot of time between now and then.  What will you do right now?  
EUN HEE JI: I don't know.  Just chill out a little bit.  If I get close, I start practice.
