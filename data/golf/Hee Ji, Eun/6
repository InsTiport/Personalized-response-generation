Q. Ten birdies today.  Must have felt like you couldn't miss at one point.
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I felt like really, really great day today.  I didn't miss any fairways and I just miss two greens I think.  Yeah.
I hit it really great today.
Q. You got off to a fantastic start.  Leading scoring average on the LPGA at the moment.  What do you think has changed and what's given you confidence in the early part of this season?
EUN-HEE JI: I don't know.  I just hit it great.  I change my swing a little bit and I change a little bit my putting style and I made a lot of putt from there, so, yeah, I got a lot of confidence.
Q. And the win early in the season at the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions, how does that take the pressure off the rest of the year when you've already got a win in the bag?
EUN-HEE JI: Pressure right off from that.  Yeah, winning is -- just starting the good season from the winning, so a lot pressure off and just try my best.
Q. You're known on the LPGA as maybe the sneakiest player out there because you kind of come from nowhere and you're lifting the trophy.  Is that a good thing?  I think so.
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I think so.  Just holding the trophy is good thing.
Q. How did you find the heat?
EUN-HEE JI: It's really hot today.  Yeah, just drink a lot water and amino stuff.
Q. Have you been for long?
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, yeah, I been here a lot of times.
Q. So you're acclimatized a bit?
EUN-HEE JI: Uh-huh.
Q. What about the course?  Is it hard or easy?  You made it look easy.
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, actually this course is a little bit long driver are easier, but for me, I always, you know, like all the aim pint is a little bit of tricky, but I getting my distance little bit so make it a little easier than last year.  Maybe that's why I hit it...
Q. You changed your swing, was that for long game or short game?
EUN-HEE JI: Long games, yeah.
