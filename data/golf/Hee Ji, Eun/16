 Q.  5-under today; currently tied for the lead.  What was the key to going low out there today?  
EUN HEE JI: You know what?  Rough is really hard out there, so I try to keep in my fairway and try to keep it on the green.   
So I really focus on that.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the Aviara Golf Club.  How do you feel like this course suits you?  
EUN HEE JI: I don't know.  That's kind of hard question.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Do you feel like it's been a challenge for you over the years?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, it is.  I keep trying to change my swing.  I feel more comfortable with my new swing, so that's why hit it a lot better.   
 Q.  You're off to your best start in a tournament so far in 2018.  What have you been working on heading into this week?  
EUN HEE JI: I was working on my putting because I haven't felt good last week and before.   
It's really tricky, the greens right here on this golf course, so I try to keep it more confidence and more... (indiscernible.)  Yeah, kind of, so that will work, yeah.
