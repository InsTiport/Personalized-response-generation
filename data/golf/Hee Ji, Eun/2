Q. How do you feel you did this week?
EUN HEE JI: I feel like I play really good first two round and I didn't play well last two round.
So it's good playing this week, but it's not for me.  I try really hard, but it's not.  Try to get up there, but it was okay.
Q. Was it rough with the weather conditions?
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, first two round doesn't have a lot of windy, but last two rounds was really windy out there.  Playing a lot of differently than first two rounds, so that makes it little hard.
Q. Was there anything else that went wrong?
EUN HEE JI: Actually just windy.  That makes a lot of different golf course.  Play really -- have to play look at the wind and have to play for distance, everything.  I have to think about it, yeah.
Q. And then last question would be like what good experiences or things came out of this?
EUN HEE JI: First two round I was up there, good position, just more confidence with that.  I didn't play well last two round, but still I was up there and just get more confidence about that.
