Q. Eun Hee, awesome round, except for maybe the last two holes.  What was different today?
EUN HEE JI: I mean, I hit it pretty good today.  I putted pretty well, except two hole.  Actually, my second shot wasn't too bad on 17.  18 my tee shot is great shot but just a little too far left so I couldn't make the green.
But, you know, I think it's just bad luck.
Q. Just bad luck?
EUN HEE JI: I think so.
Q. Feeling okay though?
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.  I feel great since yesterday.  Actually, my putted well with like 15-foot or 20-footer.  I made a lot of putt from there.  But my long putting wasn't that good today.
So, you know, the golf is like that all the time.
Q. Yeah, so different every day.  What are you going to do for tomorrow?
EUN HEE JI: Trying to get my feel back on my long putting.  My swings not too bad, so I'm trying to keep it well.
Q. Just working on putting?
EUN HEE JI: Yes.
Q. Are you using new putter or old putter?
EUN HEE JI: No, I'm using same as last year.
