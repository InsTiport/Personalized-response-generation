 Q.   Let's ask you about the whole PGA experience for you this year.   
DAVID HRONEK:   It was incredible.   I mean, it's a dream come true to be able to play not only in a TOUR event, but my first event being a major.   I couldn't have asked for anything better other than maybe playing a little bit better.   It comes with experience.   
I'll go after the club pro in Philly next year and get the Top 20 and go to Wesleyan and do a little bit better job.   
   
 Q.   You are a teaching pro.   Talk about that a little bit.   The Top 20 qualified.   
DAVID HRONEK:   I'm the director of instruction at Countryside Country Club in Clearwater.   The Top 20 guys at the national club pro qualify for the PGA Championship.  
   
 Q.   And what was the weather like?   Pretty rainy and wet starting off today.   
DAVID HRONEK:   It was.   I'm used to playing in rain off and on like this down in Florida.   We get off and on all the time, especially in the summertime.   It's more annoying than it is anything.   But if you kind of block it out and just go about your business and not really let it get to you, stay dry and just keep playing.   That's all you can do.  
   
 Q.   Getting the ball to stop a little bit better for you on the greens?  
DAVID HRONEK:   Today they did, yeah.   The hard part today was actually getting out of that rough.   Yesterday, you could advance it, today you couldn't because it was so wet.
