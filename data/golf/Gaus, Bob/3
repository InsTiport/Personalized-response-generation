Q.   Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, what it's meant for you to make the cut out here and compete with a lot of the, I guess, top talent around?
BOB GAUS:   Well all the best guys over 50.   Well, that was my goal going in.   I've been dreaming about it for a year, since I knew I was in this tournament. 
So it means everything.   So it's nice to be in on the weekend, in front of my fans, fans, friends, family, whatever.   But, yeah, it's a dream I'll keep for a long time.   This is pretty cool.

Q.   How were the crowds out there today?
BOB GAUS:   They were pretty good.   A lot of guys were following me around.   Sandy Lyle had 20 people following him and he's a Masters champion.   So go figure that one out.   But it was pretty cool out there.   A lot of people.

Q.   And how are you feeling heading into the final round tomorrow?
BOB GAUS:   Well, feeling pretty comfortable.   I really got nothing to lose now. 
So my goal is to shoot 4â€‘under, try to shoot even par for this tournament and that would be good enough.
