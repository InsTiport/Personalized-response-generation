Q.   First of all, just the thrill of competing, take me back to a few months ago when you found out you were going to actually be in the tournament?
BOB GAUS:   Well, shoot, I mean, it was a pretty good feeling.   I was in Sunriver, Oregon.   Had to do it the hard way, do it through a playoff.   But just to get off, I'm pretty excited about it, pretty happy. 

Q.   How many major championships does this make for you and how special has it been?
BOB GAUS:   Well, seven altogether.   Well, eight.   Let's see, hold on.   Five PGA, two U.S. Opens, one Senior. 
Being 52years old, this ranks up there as pretty good.   I figured my days were kind of over with.   Getting in this, coming here was pretty nice.   Very nice place.   I had a good time.
