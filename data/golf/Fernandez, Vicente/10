 Q.  The best score by five shots today; what were you able to figure out that everyone else couldn't today?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ: Maybe because I started very well.  I hit four or five good shots at the beginning of the round and I took advantage of it, and then I kept playing well, hitting fairways, and then not be too aggressive on some holes that my caddy convinced me that if you go beyond the pin it will be tough to make 2-putts.  I played that well and then coming in I hit three good shots again and I made birdies. 

Q.  How did you approached those final three holes?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ: Well, I hit it very good driver on No.  7.  And I didn't hit too good a shot on 7 because I didn't want to go -- I mean beyond the pin, so I tried to keep it short.  I keep it too short about a 30-footer and I make that one, and then on 8 I was -- I mean lucky because I pushed my driver into the rough and I could chip it up about 120 yards and then I hit it sand wedge about four inches from the hole.  I mean 10 inches from the hole. 
On 9 I hit a very good driver, pitching wedge for about ten feet and I made a putt. 

Q.  Did you feel like you were playing that much better than yesterday, or was it just you were getting breaks?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ: Well, I think I didn't make the mistake, mental mistake that I made yesterday.  I made three or four mental mistakes that I made yesterday which I didn't do and I think that was the difference.  Plus I think the rain last night made the course a little bit more receptive especially on the greens and that helps you to be a little bit more aggressive and get the ball closer.
