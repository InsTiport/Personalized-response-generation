VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I don't really know because I haven't been on the leaderboard for a long time. So I don't remember when was last.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah, I did.  I played.  Yeah, because I finished third on the PGA, and then --

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  And then eighth.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No problem.  Well, I stroked the ball well today.  I had a lot of good shots onto the greens, a lot of good birdie chances which I didn't take them all, but I'm pleased the way I played.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  You know what, it has been like  this all my life.  I never was early starter.  I mean, I always start playing well June, May, June, July.


Q.  You need the weather to get hot, is that it?

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, we didn't have good weather after Naples, we didn't have very good weather until the US Open.  We have really poor weather.  Well, I cannot complain today.  It was beautiful.


Q.  You prefer the warm weather?

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes.  Old bones prefer warm weather.  Yesterday was very cold.  Went out at 7 o'clock in the morning.  I didn't -- I wasn't prepared.  I didn't think it was that cold.


Q.  You didn't have any trouble today?  You were in birdie position most of the day?

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes.  Except 16, which I missed the green, and then I hit up-and-down.  Then I 3-putted the 15, but from long, long distance.  I mean, I missed a very short putt, a 3-footer for par.  But, yeah, most of the time I was very close.  I have a chance being counted (sic) with my son there, about six chances inside eight feet, which I miss, yeah.  And, those, which I holed, like, for example, my birdies were very close.  No. 2 was three feet.  No. 6 was the longest, about eight feet.  Then No. 10, it was seven feet.  13, it was a foot and a half.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No, I missed the green on the left-hand side.  Hit a bad second shot.


Q.  Your impressions of this course?  You played one time, there's been a few changes made.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I like it.  I liked it.  This year, with those changes, it's tougher.  Bunker on the right, 2nd hole, then the bunker on the left at 9th, then the bunker on the right on 13th.  New tee at 16, new bunkers, which get the men to play.  He make the hole tougher.  I think the course is tougher, for good.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Thank you.

VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Thank you, very much.
