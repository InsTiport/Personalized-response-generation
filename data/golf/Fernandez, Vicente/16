VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Okay, at the 10, hit 3-wood from the tee and then sand wedge about eight feet from the hole.  11, 3-wood again.  8-iron.  And about 9 feet from the hole. 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah, I have a lot of opportunity today.  I played from tee-to-green a lot better than yesterday.  I have a lot of birdie chances, and I only take those two.  I have got birdie chance at the 3rd; good birdie chance at the 5th.  Good birdie chance at the 7th.  Good birdie chance at the 8th.  And then good birdie chance at 15th.  And that was it. 
 

Q.  Make any adjustments with the wind at all? 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah, a little bit today because it was very strong, yeah. 
 

Q.  Did you make any adjustments in your swing?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes, I did. 
 

Q.  What all did you do?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I just tried to keep the ball low without using my hands; tried to just to swing through, putting it a little bit more back on my right foot. 
 

Q.  You thought you had a good round, but could have been a lot better with some of the missed birdie opportunities earlier?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  It could be, yes, it could be a lot better today. 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  On Tour? 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No. 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I think so because when we played the PGA it wasn't that windy.  It was breezy, but not this windy.  I don't remember if we play any other round as windy as  today.  I don't remember. 
 

Q.  Can you just talk about your feelings being tied for the lead?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  It is a very good feeling.  I wish I have more often that feeling. 
 

Q.  On the European Tour did you have a lot of wind like this?  Did you develop --
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Very often.  Very often, yeah. 
 

Q.  How much did that experience help today?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I think it helped because -- especially to adjust distance, it is very difficult to adjust distance when you are not used to the wind.  More than striking the ball is to get the right distance because to adjust how much is going to affect, even to putt on the greens, it is quite difficult because it is not, I mean, a permanent breeze. It is come in and it goes, which is more difficult.  Sometimes you expect the ball to go 20 more yards and the wind drop and it goes only 5, so it is quite difficult. 
 

Q.  Talk about number 11.  That is one of the toughest holes out here and you made birdie there.
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah, 10 also.  As I told you before, even those holes with the wind behind, they were tough.  Like number 1, number 2, number 3, they were tough holes and the -- 10 was a tough hole even you hit the shot short, I mean I hit a sand wedge but it still was a tough  shot.  11, I hit 3-wood and 8-iron and it was a tough shot because just a little miss-hit and.... Adios. 
 

Q.  How many times would you say when you are getting ready to hit a shot that you may have changed clubs or just --
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I didn't change much club but I changed shots.  I hit the same club and different distance because when I was ready, may drop, so I hit a little bit easier or the other way around, so it was tough. 
 

Q.  More pressure on your caddie?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  You are saying the wind is more difficult when it is towards your back as opposed to towards your face?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  It is as difficult when it is towards your face.  Even hitting the short irons, it was difficult to control it because sometimes, if the wind blows too hard, you hit a sand wedge and the wind drops it down so it doesn't go that far so you have to hit kind of shot that it first goes up to make the wind put it forward, but you hit it just too see it may drop down, so it is tough. 
 

Q.  As hard as it is to play, mentally it's got to be difficult on a day like today.  What do you do to keep your mind focused?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I have a lot of things.  All depends what shot it is; where it is, I have a lot of things that I do in my career, I learn it and it helped me a lot in  these conditions, but if it gets cooler than today, then it is something else that you have to add it because the ball won't go as far as it went today, so it is going to play even longer. 
 

Q.  Does that wear on you mentally because every shot requires even more attention?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  It is a lot more thing to concentrate about.  We all want less things to think about. 
 

Q.  Do you like your chances this week?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Oh, yes, I like it.  I like to be in this situation.  I mean, for me, as I said before, just to be here is a dream come true and playing like I am playing, what else can I ask for? 
 

Q.  You are probably afraid to take off your bracelet at this point?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  (Laughter.) 
 

Q.  Never ever take it off again?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No.  No.  No. 
 

Q.  Before the tournament, before today, would you say that you were a good wind player?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I always considered myself a very good wind player, but I wasn't feeling well the last few days.  I mean, the last three or four days because I had something wrong on Monday.  I am allergic to shellfish and wrongly I had a shrimp on Monday morning in my breakfast.  I had to go straight to the hospital and I was a bit weak and  dizzy because I mean the medicine they put me -- in my vein, so I am very happy to just to play the way I played and to be in this position.  I didn't expect -- to be honest, I didn't expect at the beginning -- I mean, on Tuesday, I didn't expect to play that well. 
 

Q.  Did you eat shellfish for breakfast?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes, because it was a mixed vegetables, eggs, and they putt some shellfish. 
 

Q.  You didn't know?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I didn't know.  I am allergic.  I always take care of that.  But it really was in that and they didn't say anything.  I had to go straight to the hospital.  My manager over there was more worried than myself when we found out.  Three minutes later it start to swell. 
 

Q.  Triggers an allergic reaction?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  My throat -- 
 

Q.  Swells up?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  They had to give you an antihistamine?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes. 
 

Q.  I am allergic to shellfish too.
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  We are partners.  And I was told that in every meal they put shellfish here, is that true? 
 

Q.  Well, I don't know, I don't live here, but..... 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I wouldn't try. 
 

Q.  I have been eating fish here and not shellfish.
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Me too.  I like fish but not shellfish.  The reaction is instant. 
 

Q.  You must be very allergic to it?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Oh, yeah, I can die in two hours. 
 

Q.  Are you still taking the medicine?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No.  No.  No. 
 

Q.  Puts you to sleep?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I took it because I felt so weak and doctor told me that it would be okay, but it took longer than I expected.  I mean, very weak, headache, dizzy. 
 

Q.  It takes awhile for that medicine to get out of your system?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Maybe that is the secret to do well. 
 

Q.  This was on Monday?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Monday, yes. 
 

Q.  When did you feel back to normal?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I am feeling much better.  I still have some kind of headache and sometimes a bit weak. 
 

Q.  What did they give you, a shot?
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I still have in my vein, right here (pointing to hand). 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Thank you very much. 
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  I hope so.
