 Q.  Nice bounce back after a pretty ragged started; you got to be happy?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes, I am happy with the way I score.  I wasn't happy the way I hit it from the tee.  I didn't hit many fairways.  And if you don't hit the fairways here you will be always fighting to get your pars.  I was lucky enough to -- many fairways I missed, I had a few good lies to get a recovery.

Q.  You are only four shots behind a very difficult golf course; there can be a lot of change?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Yes, yes.  It happened yesterday. It happened today.  It can happen every day; every minute is different. 

Q.  Early on it looked like you were struggling.  It kind of showed in your demeanor as well.  What turned it around for you?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Well, I started hitting it a little bit more on the fairways and then I gave myself chances to go -- I mean closer to the pin to have birdie chances and when I hit the fairways I hit a lot of -- three or four good shots by the hole and I didn't have problems to make those birdies.

Q.  How frustrating does it seem; Bruce pulled away from you guys on the back nine?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  No, I'm not frustrated at all.  I'm happy the way it's going because I didn't play that good and I still have a chance going into tomorrow. 

Q.  What do you have to do differently tomorrow?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Hit the fairways.  Give myself an opportunity to go for the greens and get close, to get birdie opportunities.

Q.  How often are you pulling driver out of your bag?
VICENTE FERNANDEZ:  Not very often.  Not very often.  I think I hit a driver on No.  7, No. 8, 9, 16.  That's it.  Four times.  I didn't hit much in the fairway.
