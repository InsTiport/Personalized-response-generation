Q. Can you sum up your final round today?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: Yeah, I was really happy with my last round. I think I played solid. Gave myself a lot of chances. Maybe in the seven-foot range my putter was a little bit colder, but I think I made four birdies today, so I was happy with it.
Q. And your week overall you must be happy with as well.
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: Yeah, it was amazing. I mean, if you told me at the beginning of the week I would be here today I would be extremely happy with it. I feel very confident about my game going into Portland next week. That's a course I like.
I love the course at Magna this week as well. I think it was really fitting my game.
Q. So you have three tournaments left that you're going to play; is that right?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: Yeah.
Q. Do you have some goals or approach one at a time?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: I'm getting married in three weeks, so to be honest, it feels like the wedding is more on my any radar than anything at the moment.
Q. You guys going anywhere for the honeymoon?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: No. We want to be home for now. We will definitely have a honeymoon, but just push it further down the line.
Q. And I heard you're marrying your caddie.
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: Yeah.
Q. Yeah.
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: Or my caddie a marrying me.
Q. He's marrying you, yeah.
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: But, I mean, we were together first before the caddie and player, and I think we have a really great relationship. We're excited to see where things are going to take us and it's been a fun run.
Q. When you leave here right now, how much confidence do you have compared to when you arrived?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: I think a lot more, especially my ball striking. When you're at home and you hit it well or not it's one thing, but I think when the adrenaline kicks in, that's where you can really check in with your game.
I think I proved to myself that I could hold under pressure this week. It was so amazing to have all the fans and young girls that came out and so many people from QuÃ©bec here.
I think I was feeding off the positive energy here.
Q. How do you balance the rigors of wedding planning with the rigors of professional golf?
ANNE-CATHERINE TANGUAY: We set the date like a while ago, so it was really good. When I was home it was like a distraction to me. I could just kind of have my mind go there.
But I think the last two weeks before the wedding are going to be intense. I don't think quite what -- I know what to expect, but it should be fun.
