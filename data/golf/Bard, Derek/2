Q. A rough day but still a wonderful week.  What do you take out of this week?
DEREK BARD: I take a lot.  First thing is, learned a lot about myself, my game.  I realized I can play with people at this level.  Just realized that if you're down and out, just never count yourself out and just keep grinding away and see what happens in the end.
I did the first few matches, and it fell my way.  And unfortunately today was a different story.
Q. Was there any point in the match today where you thought, man, I just can't stop this guy right now.
DEREK BARD: The second afternoon round, on hole 8, I hit in the hazard off the tee.  Hit a 7-iron on the green, rolled in a 30-foot-par putt; and he hit in the bunker off the tee, hit it on there 15 feet and made it on top of me.  I figured after making the putt, I could get away with a halve and salvage the match a little bit, and he poured it in on me.
Q. That was obviously a tough break, but after this week, you get to play in the Masters.  What's that going to be like?
DEREK BARD: That's a nice consolation prize.  That's been my dream since I was a little kid to play in the Masters.  Now it's here, coming in April and it's fantastic.
