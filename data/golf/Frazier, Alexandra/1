   RHONDA GLENN: Today you just hung in there. I kind of thought the match seemed to turn your way on No. 10 when she left that birdie putt short. And then on 11, it looked like things were going your way.
 How were you feeling at that time? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Well, I was happy to still be playing and not be too far down. Yeah, 10, I was happy to two-putt on 10, and she missed the birdie putt. So if she was going to make it, there wasn't anything I could do about it. 
 If she happened to miss it, I didn't think the tide was really turning my way. It's certainly did -- that's an interesting hole, the 11th hole, because the long hitters should have the advantage. Each day I've won that hole from the long hitters because they try to go for it in two and then they're in a funny spot, and I just put it on the green with a full shot. 
 So almost every single match I won that hole from the people who really should have taken that hole from me.
 RHONDA GLENN: How do you feel about this whole experience? I mean, runner-up at a national championship. You came within one hole of winning. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Yeah. Well, I'm so proud of myself. I'm going to have to take probably a month to let it all sink in. 
 But, yeah, it's a national championship. As I said in my speech, this never was a dream of mine because it seemed so far away and unattainable. I'm just shocked I'm here and delighted and proud. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Does this mean you'll set your sites higher now when you play some of these larger championships? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Well, that's the thing that's interesting? When the nice USGA woman, Edie, told me on the first tee that I had an exemption into the U.S. Amateur next year, I though, Oh, my gosh. I better work on my game.
 RHONDA GLENN: Are you? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Sure. Why not? If I just get the badge it'll be good enough. 
 RHONDA GLENN: That's great. Questions.

 Q. Just go through a few of the key moments. What happened on 14? Did you putt it where you wanted it?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: 14 is the around the corner par...

 Q. Yeah, a little uphill chip, rolled it about six feet past. 
 RHONDA GLENN: That's where you missed that short putt.
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Oh, 14. That was a shame. Yeah, 14 I felt like I was in a good position to be able to get up and down. I landed the chip exactly where I wanted to land it, but it wasn't the right spot. So it ended up going by the hole. 
 And then I was planning on hitting the putt more firmly than I did, so it lost on the low side.

 Q. Did you at any point feel like you were...
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Going to win it? No. Well, I have to say, I mean, maybe this doesn't sound like being much of a competitor, but I really didn't want to embarrass myself today, so I was pleased to be hanging in there. That kind of took the pressure off. 
 If I was worried about whether or not I was going to be the national champion, I probably wouldn't have played as well as I did. I'm pleased with the way I played. I'm just kind of scrappy player, and I was able to do it with a huge gallery. 
 There's a real adrenaline rush when a putt goes in and everybody cheers. It's an unbelievable feeling. It's kind of addictive, so I hope I get back into this position again sometime.

 Q. On 17, were you hoping the ball might just draw in there a little more?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Yes, that's exactly what I was planning. It just didn't. I was hoping that it would hit shorter and roll into the hole. I hit it exactly pin high, but just too far right.

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Well, the first thing when I putted from the fringe was like an impossible putt. I was hoping to get it below the hole -- or didn't want to leave it on the top fringe. That would have been death. 
 So I wanted to get it below the hole so I had a chance to come back up again, and then I didn't make it. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Jim made the point your that ball on 17, he wondered if maybe it was up against the second cut of the fringe. Did you have to lift your putter at all to allow... 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: No, I didn't. I was worried about that when I walked up straight behind it. But the fact that I had to putt literally sideways through, then it didn't bother me at all.
 RHONDA GLENN: Did you ever consider chipping that? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: No.
 RHONDA GLENN: Because it was so slick downhill? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: I only had to hit it about two feet. So, no, I never considered chipping it. 

 Q. You said you didn't consider yourself anything near Rocky. If you won the whole thing you said you might, but Rocky didn't win the whole thing either. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Oh, he didn't? I've forgotten. It's been so long. Well, so maybe I am Rocky. I don't know. I don't want to be Rocky. (Laughter.) I'm not a big Sylvester Stallone fan, so I'm not thrilled with that analogy.
 RHONDA GLENN: Where do you go from here now? I mean, this is beyond your expectations. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: It is beyond my expectations. Actually I've been planning all week -- I want to make a real commitment to become a better ball-striker. So this winter, because I won't play in anything competitive -- I don't think I have anything competitive left to play in, so maybe I'll play in the Sally (phonetic) in January. 
 So I really can commit to working on my ball-striking.
 RHONDA GLENN: And you go to Florida in the winter? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Back and forth. We go back and forth.

 Q. When did Tom decide to caddie for you?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: My husband? 

 Q. Yes. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Maybe before we even got married. We've been married for 11 years.

 Q. In this championship. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Well, as soon as I qualified. He's got it blacked out on his calendar. He's a doctor. The second I qualify, he blocks out the time. 
 But we literally had reservations on the airplane to go home on Tuesday morning thinking the best we could do is make match play. If we didn't we could watch our friends play and then we would go home Tuesday morning. I had no, no expectation that I would still be here on Thursday. 
 It's wonderful to have my husband on the bag. It's nice for him to be part of the team. You know, he's a wonderful supportive person. Not to say that my substitute caddie wasn't unbelievably great. I've never heard so many positive comments. Oh, this shot is gonna be perfect for you. You just put a nice stroke on it. It'll be a perfect putt. Just a lot of positive reinforcement, and that helped a lot.

 Q. What sort of doctor is Tom?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: He's an oncological surgeon. He specializes in breast cancer.

 Q. Someone said he had patients scheduled for surgery Thursday. 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Wednesday. Almost 50 patients on Wednesday, and then surgery scheduled on Thursday. 

 Q. Did you get a chance to talk to him yesterday?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Yeah, so we've talked a lot. He was afraid I would oversleep, although I was up at 3:00 in the morning. He called me. Oh, my gosh, I've been up since 3:00. I'm going to sleep well tonight, let's put it that way. 

 Q. Did you get back to bed?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: No. I actually started answering all the texts. I've had so many texts and e-mails that I thought, Well, while I'm here and wide awake, I might as well get on my phone and start answering these texts.
 RHONDA GLENN: Have you talked to your husband? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: No. He scooped me right up. I haven't had the chance. 

 Q. Any back and forth between you about him not being here? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: He wants to be here, but he couldn't be. Yeah.

 Q. Is he a good golfer?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: He is a 14 handicap.

 Q. And you?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: A one. You're surprised? 

 Q. No. (No microphone.)
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Well, thanks. I got up to a three in the middle of the summer, and I just got it down to a one again. I had a bad July. 
 RHONDA GLENN: But a wonderful October.
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: And a wonderful October. 

 Q. How long have you used that putter? 
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: It was one of the first prototypes that was sent to the pro in our pro shop. So every since they were brand new made, we scooped it right out of his shop. It was actually sent to him to try. It wasn't even for sale. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Yes. The pro that was there before our current pro was a man named Terry Hertzog. It was his, and I've been putting with it, I don't know, 2001 they came out or something. It's been a great putter for me.
 Only thing I changed was I changed the lie angle a little bit to make my eyes see straight over the ball. That was, you know, eight, ten years ago. 

 Q. Did you know your mom was coming?
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: No. And I saw her after the putt on 3. I was walking back to the cart, and I heard, Good, putt, A.K. I'm like, I know that voice. My mom, she came all the way from Vero Beach. She got up at 4:30 this morning and drove down to see me play, my mother and stepfather. It was great.
 RHONDA GLENN: Well, you played beautifully. You rallied. You're a great match player. We appreciate you helping us and coming in and being so gracious.
 ALEXANDRA FRAZIER: Thank you. Thank you for being at all interested in anything I have to say. (Laughter.) 
 RHONDA GLENN: Thank you very much.
