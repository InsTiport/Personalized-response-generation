  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Hee Kyung Seo into the interview room.   I know you had six birdies today during your round.   Can you take me through what went well for you out there.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   At the beginning of the round, it was little rough to me.   My driver was right and left, so I had to find the feeling of the shot.   
But the good thing was the ball was hitting at the open area so I didn't have to make a tricky shot or from the rough.   I had very comfortable shot.   
The one more good thing is I made a lot of birdie opportunities that I had.   So I only got 26 putts today.   That's why I think I made a really good score.   
THE MODERATOR:   Is this your first time in Toledo?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   How do you like it?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I like it.   There are not many spectators out there, but everyone is cheering for us and everyone is very kindâ€‘ful, so I really like it.   
THE MODERATOR:   It was drizzling at the beginning of your round.   Did that affect you?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   It was hard.   I had to put my jacket on and off.   It was hard to concentrate a little bit.   I feel a little rough because I had to put my jacket and off.   
After maybe five or six holes later, it was okay.   
THE MODERATOR:   This would be your first victory in a couple years.   What are your thoughts heading into the weekend?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Really I want to be first win as a member.   I had lots of, you know, this situation when I was playing Korea, so I'm very get used to it.   I'll just wait for what's going to happen and try to do my best.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Thank you.
