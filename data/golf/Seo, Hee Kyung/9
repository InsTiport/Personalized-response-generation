   HEE KYUNG SEO: I had a few great shots. The putting was great today, so I was just trying to concentrate on the target. That makes the result, and I'm very happy of that.

 Q. You shot a-1 yesterday and a -5 today. What was the difference, if any?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Yesterday I had too many bogeys. Obviously it was a little windy, but this morning it was calm and I could make my own swing. 
 Yeah, that gave me good result.

 Q. You tore it up on the first nine, four birdies. Anything special, or just everything fell right?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Well, I could be more confident today, so that makes good result. I don't know. 

 Q. How does it look for the weekend? You're only two down from the lead. The leader is at -8; you're at -6. 
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Oh, yeah? Well, there is two more rounds left, so I'll just do my best and I'll keep trying to focus on the target. We will see. 

 Q. Will this help your chances for rookie of the year?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Hopefully, yeah, but there is many events in end of the year. So, yeah, I will try my best.
