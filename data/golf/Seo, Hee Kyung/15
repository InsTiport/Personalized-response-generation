 Q. So based on your play on solid round today, what's your strategy going into the final round?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: I was a little tired at the morning, even though I didn't play. I think everybody is tired, so I was trying to keep concentrate one shot at a time. 
 I hit really good and I made (indiscernible) and made two putts on the green. I think everything was good, and I'm happy.

 Q. Is there a specific birdie or something that sticks out in your mind? Obviously you made a few birdies out there. 
 HEE KYUNG SEO: I think all the birdie really is like (indiscernible) because I didn't have -- I only have one birdie during two rounds, so three birdies very big for me. Four birdies, yeah. 

 Q. What are you going to focus on going into the final round?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Well, just trying to hold my energy up, because it's gonna be very tough day, and think about one shot at a time and be positive. That's all.
