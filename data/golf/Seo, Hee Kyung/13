 Q. Going into 18 there, the wind really kind of came up. You backed off. So that gave you -- you gave a shot there before coming back with a nice par at 18. 
 HEE KYUNG SEO: I was really nervous when I had the par putt.

 Q. I also have to ask you, there was a chime. The shrine chimed in your back swing as you had 192 yards left up to 18. Did you hear that, or did you just kind of hit through that?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Well, it happen lots of times --

 Q. You were used to it?
 HEE KYUNG SEO: -- in past four rounds. 
 It didn't -- yeah.

 Q. We thank you for coming up. Best of luck. See if you can hang on to win the U.S. Women's Open and become the fifth Korean to do that. 
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Thank you.
