  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Hee Kyung Seo into the interview room.   Congratulations, a fabulous round today.   You put yourself within one shot of the leader, Suzann Pettersen.   Take me through the day out there.   You had some tremendous chip shots that you hit, holed out and made some big putts.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Yeah, the shot making was good, too, and I had lots of great birdie opportunities and great chances to make it, and then obviously it was really windy, but I think I got a little used to about wind from yesterday, so it wasn't that hard for me.   But I just picked my target and then waited for it to happen.   I just tried to do my own thing, not think about results of other players or scores, just try to think my thing that I worked on last few weeks, and it's getting better and better and I've got more confidence in that.  
THE MODERATOR:   I was talking to your caddie, and he said that you got a little motivation from watching the Masters and that you picked up a little tidbit.   What did you pick up from watching Angel and Adam during that round?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Dean always said to me that the shorter routine helps a lot to make more good shots or good putts, but I always struggled when I got to the ball, it was hard to make a shot.   But from last week Masters I could see Angel and Adam just didn't think about anything on the ball, just hit and waited for the result.   So I just tried to do that, not think about the bad things or the results and other things but just swing it and feel it, and it helped a lot, I think.   
THE MODERATOR:   When you pick up that pace and you're not standing over the ball thinking, it really can help your game quite a bit.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Uh‑huh.  
THE MODERATOR:   Overall how your game has been feeling, what do you think has been the difference this week compared to some of the other weeks?   Did you figure out something in your game or is there something you've been working on?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I've changed a lot the last few months, to December, but I didn't change my swing or anything but try to be consistent on my swing and rhythm.   So I think I'm a little‑‑ getting something from work on that rhythm things and using my big muscles instead of picking my hands and thinking about all the negative things.   
And I worked on short putts a lot last week, and then it's little‑‑ I think a lot helping me to get through the ball instead of thinking of pushing or pulling.   That short putt helps me a lot more long putts, too, because I don't worry about short putts anymore, so I think I can go more aggressive on the ball.  
THE MODERATOR:   I know you've got some exciting things happening to you personally, that you got engaged last December, and I also heard your fiancÃ© is here and you haven't been together in six weeks or two months or something like that.  
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Yeah, absolutely.  
THE MODERATOR:   How much has it helped having him here this week and getting engaged and looking forward to another phase in your life?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Well, it's Hawai'i, so it's really good to be here with him, and also my mom is here so we are having fun and not thinking about golf after a round.   He is just always trying to make me happy.   He's a really positive man, so if I think about negative things or I get depressed a little bit he tries to make me happy and always trying to make me feel really good.   It's a little hard to be away from him; it's not easy to travel without him.   But I think sometimes it's good to be separated.  
THE MODERATOR:   Can you give us his name and the spelling of his name?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Yeah, his name is Kung Hoon Kook.  
   
 Q.   Was there something that happened early today that got your round going for you?   Was there one shot or one putt that you made that really got things working?  
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I started a little hard on the first hole.   I didn't make the fairway and it was in the bunker and I didn't make another fairway.   So it was a little hard for me to make a par.   And the second hole, there was a shower, so it was hard to make a second shot, but I hit a really good second shot and then made a birdie, and then I got a little motivation.  
   
 Q.   Overall what did you do best today?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Best, just I think I really focused on the shots.   I shot not thinking about results.   I didn't even look up at the leaderboard and I didn't recognize that I'm hitting like 5‑ or 6‑under until the 18th hole.   Yeah, I just really focused on the ball, yeah.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel about the eagle that you had?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Yeah, I was talking to Dean on the second shot earlier, do I have to go to the flag or right side of green.   It was not that hard chip shot, but I didn't expect that I would make that.   But yeah, I hit it really good, and I picked the right spot and I hit it to the spot and it just went in.   
   
 Q.   This golf course with these conditions, which are probably going to be similar tomorrow, what's the most critical thing you need to do tomorrow?  
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Just the same as the last three days, just pick the target and hit to the target and wait until it happens and just waiting and be patient.   And the greens are not that firm or fast, so I think we will tend to pick the green direction because Dean and I struggled some shots to pick the direction of the wind so I didn't make the green.   So tomorrow I think it's really important to pick the direction of the wind.
