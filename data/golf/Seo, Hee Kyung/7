  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Hee Kyung Seo into the interview room.   Take me through your round today, what you did well.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   The shot was better than yesterday, so I can see through it to the target.   I made lots of good putts.   Obviously I started with bogey, but I tried to be patient.   
At the back nine I had two bogeys.   I could not concentrate at that hole.   I don't know why.   I was just trying to keep positive thinkings, bring energy up.   I got great bounce‑back on next hole with eagle.   
So I really like it, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Going back to last year, you won the Louise Suggs Rookie of the Year award.   You had a memorable remark from the speech, telling everyone you were in the rearview mirror.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I wanted to add a little bit of humor.   Somebody was help me because, yeah, I couldn't do that by myself.   It was a little hard for me.   I really practice hard to memory that words.   
Yeah, I think everyone wants to be No.1, so I just mentioned that, that I'll be the No.1 very soon.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   What did you say?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I said that when I came to that awards, I said that in the car mirror, the object is closer than they appear.   
   
 Q.   Everybody wants to be No.1 right now.   Right now there's four No.1's.   There's nothing higher than a 69, lower than a 66.   What is it going to take tomorrow for one of you to separate yourselves from the others?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I think it's very important to keep the fairway.   It's little soft now.   The tee shot is very important.   
One more thing is, on the greens, we have to say that we have a chance, we have to make it to get a win.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you'll maybe try a few things tomorrow that ordinarily you wouldn't; take a few chances instead of being conservative?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   No.   I'll just keep doing my thing.   I will try to just take my time every shot, try to not make such a mistake like today, two holes.   I will try to just concentrate every moment.   
THE MODERATOR:   I know you won once on the LPGA already prior to becoming a member.   A win tomorrow would make you a Rolex first‑time winner.   What would that mean to you?   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   That's the first goal for me, to win an LPGA by a member.   So I'll just chase my dreams.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Thank you.
