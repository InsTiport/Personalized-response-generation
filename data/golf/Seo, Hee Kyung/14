 I could focus at the morning, and then, you know, fourth round in front nine, the shot I hit really good, but the putting rhythm was good.   
 So I just trust myself and just let it go, and I made lots of birdies, yeah.  
  
  Q. How do you feel leading the U.S. Open with just a few more holes to play tomorrow?

  Q. What's this day like? I mean, to wake up 3-over this morning and now you're finishing probably the U.S. Open champion, what is that like?  
 HEE KYUNG SEO: Um, like last few months I couldn't trust myself and I could not focus on my game. I just struggled on my puttings and shots.   
 So after Wegmans I went to Niagara Falls and I went -- what was the ship name? I mean, I went to Falls with my parents, and we were talking about you need to be -- you are No. 1 to us, so you need to trust yourself.   
 And then, yeah, when I was played well in Korea, I think I really 100% trust myself, so I was trying keep trust myself, and then it happened. Yeah.
