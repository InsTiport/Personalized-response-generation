Q.   Good playing.   4â€‘under round.   What was working for you out there?
HEE KYUNG SEO:   It was pretty windier than yesterday, so (indiscernible) and I was trying to figure out which way the breeze coming.
Shot making was good and putting was good.   I only missed one short putt, so I really had a confidence on the green.   I just went through.   I just played my game, yeah.

Q.   How is it playing at home this week? 
HEE KYUNG SEO:   It's great.   I mean, played last week for LPGA Tour.   It was really fun.   I could not win, but it was fun and enjoyed it, and lots of fans coming out and cheer me up. 
It's really fun, yeah.

Q.   Do you know how many family and friends you have out here?   Too many to count?
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I mean, it was hard to get a ticket for them.   I try my best to invite them. 
It's good, yeah.

Q.   I was talking to Dean, and he said you have a wedding date.   It's coming up really soon.   How is that going, planning a wedding and playing an tour? 
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I'm very invited.   Everything was all done except the dress.
So after Taiwan I have to pick my dress.   Very, you know, exciting.   Also, I had a pre wedding photo shoot.   I've already tried four dresses on, so it makes me more confuse because I don't know.   It's all beautiful, so I cannot choose just one of them.   But very happy. 

Q.   So you don't have any idea which one you're choosing yet?
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Now it's the list, two of them.   One is mermaid line, and one is really big.   It's really different.   I don't know.   I have to think about it.

Q.   Where are you going to pick out of the dress?   Are you coming back home? 
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Uh0huh.

Q.   Flying back home after Korea?
HEE KYUNG SEO:   After Taiwan.

Q.   Your fiancee is out here this week.   How nice is that to have him out by your side?
HEE KYUNG SEO:   I can hear his whistle.   That makes me very, you know, like fighting and really happy. 

Q.   Perfect.   Thank you. 
HEE KYUNG SEO:   Thank you.
