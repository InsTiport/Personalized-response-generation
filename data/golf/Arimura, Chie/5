  Q. Rough start to the day with bogey at 1 and 3, were you nervous?   
 CHIE ARIMURA: I would not say I was nervous, but my body was telling me something was wrong. I told myself I needed to focus and get my rhythm back so my body could cooperate. It got better gradually and I starteded to enjoy the round more.  
  
  Q. Talk about the eagle at #5.  
 CHIE ARIMURA: This eagle helped me today, it was great. I did not feel good about my shot, my body was very tense. I swung my body a few times to loosen up and I felt better, then I started to pick up again and play better shots. This cheered me up and whenever I had doubt during today's play, I reminded myself I should be confident and play shots like on hole 5. I didn't know I made an eagle since I was not able to see it go in, but as soon as I heard the cheers from the spectators, I knew I made it. I am very pleased.   
  
  Q. What will you focus on this weekend?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: Two more days to go. I need to control my rhythm. I should not play too fast when I am not playing well. Today was a perfect example, I had a rough start but I controlled myself so it got better in the end. I also want to focus on each shot.   
  
  Q. How many professional wins do you have around the world?   
 CHIE ARIMURA: I have never won outside of Japan.   
  
  Q. Who is your role model and why?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: Ai Miyazato is my role model. I like her personality and she is a great player. She plays excellent golf. We spend time together especially when we are in America, we work hard on our goals.
