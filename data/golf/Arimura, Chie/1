 Q.   First off, great playing today.   Kind of what was the key to your round? 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Yeah, so I didn't miss the green today.   So I think that all holes are better. 
 Q.   So overall when you see your name at the top of the leaderboard, what is that feeling?   You're a couple shots off the lead, but to go into Sunday in contention.
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Yeah, I feel good so far this week.   So I'll keep going, and I will focus on what is in front of me. 
 Q.   You're fourth right now in the Rookie of the Year race. 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Oh, really?  
 Q.   Is that something that you think about during the year?   Is that a goal of yours? 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Not really.   I don't think about it, because I don't play after September.   Like I played Japan Tour.   I didn't think about it.   So I didn't play well in this field, so I didn't know I was up there. 
 Q.   How has this first year been for you on the LPGA? 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Well, it's a very hard time than I thought so far, but I think I will get good experience.   It's a very good thing for me. 
 Q.   And I know you and Ai Miyazato grew up in the same area, and she's been someone you've looked up to. 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Yeah. 
 Q.   How much has she helped you this year? 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   Yeah, I cannot explain how she's done something‑‑ oh, how can I say?   Every time she helps, other Japanese players too, they helped me, and I always ask them something, so, yeah.   I can pick up a lot of things. 
 Q.   Going into tomorrow's round, anything that you want to do better or that you think you need to work on heading into tomorrow? 
  CHIE ARIMURA:   I'm not sure.   I'd like to concentrate at the time on this.   I feel I'm getting better this week, so I'll keep going.
