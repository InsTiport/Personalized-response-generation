 Q. Tell us about your round today.
 CHIE ARIMURA: Today was my first round of golf this year and I felt really nervous. I knew I had prepared well and practised hard on my putting. I am very happy to play here again and had a good round. It has been a great day for me. 

 Q. You had a bogey at 17th hole. How do you feel about it?
 CHIE ARIMURA: Among the 18 holes I only missed out on this one today. It is a shame but I have tried, there is nothing much I can do about it. I did well in other places especially my putting so I have no regret. 

 Q. How are you going to play the course tomorrow?
 CHIE ARIMURA: When I first played in events on the LPGA Tour in America, I was very eager to win and I felt nervous every time I played. But now I work hard and practice a lot, so I will focus on playing my game in order to play well tomorrow and get good results. 

 Q. Do you have any secret to play well at this course? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: I don't have any secret. 

 Q. Tell us more about yourself. 
 CHIE ARIMURA: I started playing golf at 10, my father was my first coach. I turned pro when I was 18. Besides golf, I enjoy watching movies and karaoke.

 Q. Are you a good singer?
 CHIE ARIMURA: No, I am not. 

 Q. Are you having any English lessons now? Even when you travel?
 CHIE ARIMURA: I have English lesson only when I am in Japan. My caddy speaks Japanese and English so he helps me with my English. 

 Q. Can you tell us a bit more about your outfit today?
 CHIE ARIMURA: My sponsor has very cute outfit. When we play in the US, we tend to wear simple outfit. But when we play in Asia, we tend to wear colourful outfits; especially in Japan where it is more fashionable. 

 Q. What is the name of your sponsor? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: My sponsor is ViVa Heart.

 Q. How much do you admire Ai Miyazato?
 CHIE ARIMURA: Ai is a great player. I went to the same high school with Ai, although she is 2 years above me. I always turn to Ai whenever I want a talk regarding golf or personal life, she gives great advice. I respect Ai as a player and friend.
