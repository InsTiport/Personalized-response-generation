  Q. How happy are you with how you shot?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: The score was a great score, but the ball striking wasn't really good because the hitting is not really good for the iron shots.   
 So that's why I really needed to work on the iron shots for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. And you had an eagle on hole 2. Can you kind of take me through that hole?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: From 250 yards, the driver I shot on the fairway, 250 for the sweet wood. About 33 feet for the eagle putt and then I made it.   
  
  Q. And just what does it mean playing so well in the first round of this tournament being a major tournament?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: Still only first day, and if you want to win a major, you really have to play four days of good rounds. So it's only first day. You have to concentrate for the rest of the three rounds.  
  
  Q. And I see you're wearing the button on your hat. What does that mean to you to be able to represent Japan?  
 CHIE ARIMURA: I don't really understand what does it mean, but still, if I can send some encouragement to people, it will make them a little bit happier in Japan. That's really cool.
