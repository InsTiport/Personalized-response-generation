 Q. Tough finish today but second is great and such a big tournament. How do you feel it went today?
 CHIE ARIMURA: Really pretty good round today, so I'm very happy. So I lost by a stroke.

 Q. How was it playing with Yani and Karrie? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: Really good players, and Yani is really aggressive. She's doesn't hit short. And Karrie is really smart, also. She is very calm and really a good player. 

 Q. Do you think her experience helped her today? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: I don't think so, because today is a new day. We have a good round today. 

 Q. Do you think was there a difference between today and yesterday or the other three days?
 CHIE ARIMURA: My putting was a bit short and it's no good. 

 Q. So they were going in the first three days and some of them were a little bit short today?
 CHIE ARIMURA: Yes. 

 Q. What was the turning point today?
 CHIE ARIMURA: Today, No. 11. So three behind to Karrie but I hit bogey and she had birdie, so I realise that I'm one behind. So No. 11 I think. 

 Q. Are you proud of the way you played today, because you got all the way to the end? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: Yes, I think so. 

 Q. How do you feel? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: Very happy. I'm disappointed with the result, disappointed. Very, very disappointed. But also very happy. 

 Q. One day do you hope to join the LPGA Tour? 
 CHIE ARIMURA: I'm thinking this week is really enjoyed it, and so I like the LPGA Tour. But I am playing in Japan. So maybe, maybe not.
