Q. Harold, another good round today at John Deere.  How do you feel two rounds in, two rounds to go?
HAROLD VARNER: I feel good.  Man, these guys are -- well, Michael Kim is lighting it up, but I feel like there is still an opportunity out there.
Just have to keep playing solid, stay in the moment and not worry about what everyone else is doing.
Q. Is harder to do that on a course or week that you know you have to have a lot of birdies?
HAROLD VARNER: Not really, because my goal is to make 20 birdies for the week, and I just feel like every day I'm getting closer to that.
You know, if I'd focus on me and just saying, I need to make a birdie, I need to -- you know, you just have that intent to try and birdie every hole.
Q. Today you had a bogey-free round.  What were the high lights today?
HAROLD VARNER: The biggest one was after the delay.  Just having like one little warmup and being able to hit it out of that bunker and make par.
I couldn't see on the green, so for me that was a highlight because I just did what I was supposed to do.
Q. And now you're kind of building some momentum.  How do you take that into the weekend here?
HAROLD VARNER: I'll get a good night's rest and keep doing the same thing I'm doing.  Give myself a chance, a lot of looks, and just keep rolling the rock.
I think I'm putting it really well, and just excited about the opportunity.
