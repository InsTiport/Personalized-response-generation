Q. How are you feeling after the second round?
SAKURA KOIWAI: I was not expecting this much, I am surprised myself
Q. What was the key point today?
SAKURA KOIWAI: I really had many good shot to the green, and also made few long putts Like 18, almost 10m (33feet) putt for birdie to finish strong. Weather was better today, warmer and less wind. So I  felt easier to play today.
Q. Very good position for the final round?
SAKURA KOIWAI: Every one has a chance to win because you are looking at many birdies here. So anyone can come from behind. I just have to concentrate on my golf and I have to make as much birdies as possible.
Q. Winning this event you will have chance to challenge international?
SAKURA KOIWAI: Level is very high, So I try not to think too much. I just want to do my best tomorrow. Just shot by shot.
