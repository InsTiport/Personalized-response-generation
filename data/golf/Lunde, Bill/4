 Q.   66 bogey‑free.   Last year there couldn't have been a handful of those rounds, it's difficult, not an easy course to get around on.   
BILL LUNDE:   Yeah, last year ‑‑ for sure.   I wasn't here last year, and I saw how windy it was, I was actually laughing on my couch sitting at home.   But to catch a day in Dallas where it doesn't blow like this was unusual, so it's good to take advantage of the conditions.   
   
 Q.   You live in Vegas now, you get similar weather, but you don't get days like this where the wind lays down, do you?   
BILL LUNDE:   In Vegas it either blows 0 or 40, there is no in between.   The humidity is not bad here today, so similar to Vegas.   
   
 Q.   What did you find today?   
BILL LUNDE:   Yeah, I got off to a good start, a good drive down the first hole and holed it to start the day with an eagle, so that jump‑started the round.   Had some good looks along the way, like on the last one, I had a good look.   
I missed a few of those, but, you know, I birdied 18 and 3, so those are two good holes to make birdie on, so I think I picked up a couple there on the ones I missed, and I parred both par 5s. All in all, I hit a lot of good shots and feel like I got away with a couple of bad ones.   
   
 Q.   I was going to say you feel like you should have had more with the eagle and the par on the two par 5s?   
BILL LUNDE:   For sure there was a lower score out there for me today, but it's a long way to go.   I'm just glad I got off to a good start and it's been a slow year so it's nice to hit a good round.   
  
 Q. Good luck to you the rest of the way.
