  BILL LUNDE:   Good golf course.   Played well today.   Made some putts.   Took advantage of the par-5s which was key and, all in all, played well.  
   
 Q.   What's important for you on this golf course, what do you have to do to play it well?  
BILL LUNDE:   I think the approaches into the green are very important and obviously if you can drive it well, keep it in the fairways -- lot of them kind of run-off.   If you can drive it in the fairways that's going to make it a lot easier but I think patience is a big thing.   
You kind of -- it's not quite a Major -- rough would be like a Major set-up golf course.   I think patience and kind of taking advantage of the holes that you can.  
   
 Q.   Greens are getting a little firm and fast.   How do they look to you?  
BILL LUNDE:   No, they were definitely a little quicker than I had played in the practice round Tuesday but they were rolling great.   No excuses if you hit a good putt.   Good chance of making it.  
   
 Q.   Well played, good luck tomorrow.  
BILL LUNDE:   Thank you, sir.
