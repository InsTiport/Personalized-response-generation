 Q.   Talk about your week, how you played this week and how you feel heading into to the next.   
BILL LUNDE:   I think it was the next in step in the right direction.   I played well.   It was just a matter of the putts going in.   Had a chance to shoot a real low one today and just didn't make the putts.  
My game is moving in the right direction.   Just got to keep pushing on and see if I can get a job for next year.   
   
 Q.   Right now, we're not totally done today, but you're projected to move to 131.   Talk about getting trying to get into that 125.   
BILL LUNDE:   Yeah, that's all I'm trying to do.   The ultimate goal is to get to the top 125, and secondary is not have to go Orlando to do it.   
So like I said, it's good that I played well this week.   I felt like I left a lot out there, and I look forward playing next week going to' San Jose and hopefully keep the momentum going.   
Hopefully next week the putts will drop.   Never know, maybe next week will be my week.  
   
 Q.   One last question.   Talk about how important is it to not have to get to Orlando.   Obviously you would like to lock it up next week.   
BILL LUNDE:   Yeah, you know, it's a long year, and it's nice to get that break towards the end of year not having to play into November.   I think it's November.  
   
 Q.   First week of November.   
BILL LUNDE:   Yeah.   So you get a couple months off to really enjoy the holidays and catch up with your family and friends.  
But whatever it takes is what you got to do.   Sooner I get it done, the better.
