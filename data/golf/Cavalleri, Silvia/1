 Q.   So 6‑under par in a 12‑hole layout.   How do you react to that?   
SILVIA CAVALLERI:   We played as many holes as we are allowed to play.   Just have to adopt to the course.   Now it's a 12‑hole course.   It's okay.  
   
 Q.   When you came here today, obviously there's been some challenges with the tournament and the course.   Did you have any expectations of how you were going to play on a 12‑hole course?  
SILVIA CAVALLERI:   No.   I mean it's first time for me, I think for a lot of other players.   So we just go out and we are professionals, so we just play how many holes they tell us to play.  
   
 Q.   Just take me through your round.   What worked well?   Any long birdies or chip‑ins or anything?  
SILVIA CAVALLERI:   Yeah.   I had one chip‑in and putt off the fringe that went in for a couple of birdies, and after that pretty much hit it pretty close, about ten feet all the time.   And I had a little 3‑putt as well in the round.   So kind of evens out.  
   
 Q.   What's the state of your game coming into this week?   How have you been feeling?  
SILVIA CAVALLERI:   I've been feeling good, not great.   I've been playing for a long time.   And I had a issue last year where I had medical problems and problems in my family.   So I don't expect that much.   
To me I'm just kind of starting to going and playing tournaments and getting used to be under pressure again.   So I know my game was getting ready, but I mean it's very pleased to be 6‑under after 12 holes.  
   
 Q.   Silvia, thank you so much.   
SILVIA CAVALLERI:   Thank you.
