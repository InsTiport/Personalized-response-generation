MODERATOR: 7 birdies today, 67.  Do you want to talk about all those birdies.
SILVIA CAVALLERI: Let's see, I had a bad lie in the par 5 in the ruff, but I managed to hit it pretty close; and then the 3  -- I had a wedge; and then the next birdie was on number 5, I hit a 7-iron very close; and my next one was 8, another wedge; and 9, I had an 8-iron and probably was the longest putt.  It was like, I guess, 10 meters.  Then the next one was number 11 -- on 10, I made bogey.  On 11, I used the 8-iron, and I had a putt from about of 6 meters.  I made it. 
I made bogey on the next one, and it was a difficult drive, and I used my 8-iron, and then on the par 5  --
MODERATOR:  (Inaudible?)
SILVIA CAVALLERI: 3-wood; and then on birdie on 18, I was very, very, very lucky.  It hit the tree and came up, and I made birdie from there. 
MODERATOR:  (Inaudible?)
SILVIA CAVALLERI: 2, 3 maybe.
MODERATOR:  (Inaudible?)
SILVIA CAVALLERI: Yes, I'm tired.
