  Q. Boo, does it ever get tiresome after every birdie they start "Booing" you or is that still fun?  
 BOO WEEKLEY: It's still fun. When you're playing bad it's not good. Gosh, dog, I'm playing bad. Holler for them or something.  
  
  Q. You are a crowd favorite wherever you go.  
 BOO WEEKLEY: Close to home. Lot of Southern hospitality here and they have sweet tea. That's the whole key, you know.  
  
  Q. Talk about your round today. You hit it really solid. Your iron play was really good.  
 BOO WEEKLEY: It was a pretty solid day. I putted the ball real well. I drove the ball real well. We fed off each other. It was kind of fun knowing that you go out there playing and he would hit a good shot I'm trying to hit it inside of him. It felt pretty good.  
  
  Q. I talked to your at Greenbrier. You said you were healthy. It looked to me today you were swinging free and easy.  
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah. I feel a lot better. If I can just stay loose and don't get in my own way when I'm playing golf, don't overthink it, just play golf. I think I'll be all right.  
  
  Q. You know you need about three more of these.  
 BOO WEEKLEY: It's early in the round. Still got a bunch of tournaments left, too, you know. You never know.  
  
  Q. Good playing today, Boo.  
 BOO WEEKLEY: I appreciate it. Thank you.
