Q. Eagle on the 10th hole to put together a 68.  Walk us through what you saw on that hole?
BOO WEEKLEY: Well, we struggled a little bit with the driver.  But we finally got one in play down there.  I think we had 168 or 167, something like that.  We knew the wind was kind of down behind us, so we tried to punch an 8-iron in there and it just landed perfect and rolled right up to it, and disappeared.
Q. You told me when the week started that you would be talking to me, which is usually a good thing.  What's come together this week?
BOO WEEKLEY: I got little things off my chest and all at home.  I've got some things that kind of worked out to my favor, I'm hoping that I can carry this mojo with me.
Q. Let's talk about this round.  Don't see a whole lot happening except for a nice eagle there on No. 10?
BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, I had a good eagle on 10.  Front side was kind of sluggish.  I was struggling with the driver off the tee.  Didn't really hit it close because I was playing defense the whole time.  Then finally on 18 or No. 10 I finally got good yardage, a good number just executed a good shot, and thank goodness it went in.  Got me started on the back side.
Q. Got to play some offense, 16, 17, and 18 to birdie at 16.  Really good putt on 17.  Just needed a little more, didn't it?
BOO WEEKLEY: Little more gas, that's all it needed, yes, sir.
Q. Talk about the putt on 18.  Did you go to school a little bit on Wilkinson's putt?
BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, we did.  I was playing, actually, about a cup less than what I first saw until I saw where his kept on going.  We thought it would flatten out there on the bottom, so we went ahead and aimed a little higher.  Fortunately it went in.
