Q.   Boo, another tough golf course from tee to green and you're playing well again.   Man, good playing.
BOO WEEKLEY:   I appreciate it.   I struggled a little bit today off the tee.   I kind of got myself in some, you know, craziest lies, and I got up and down out of them which was a good thing, but other than that, just overall a great day.

Q.   Explain to the folks how difficult it is playing out of rough to these tiny greens.   It's just the angles are really tough out here, aren't they?
BOO WEEKLEY:   The angles are really tough.   You try to launch it as high as you can, because if it lands off the green, you want to stay close to the green.   You can't control it coming out of the rough.   You got to play short of the green, bounce it in or either try to hit it in the bunker and hope you can get it up and down out of the bunker.

Q.   This is by far the most important question.   Is this good golf taking away or adding to your fishing time? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   Adding.   Give me a couple extra years, I think.

Q.   Couple good tournaments.   You're looking forward to next week not only this week, too.
BOO WEEKLEY:   I'm looking forward to next week.   First time I've been back since '10, I think, and I ain't never played there.   I hear it's got some small greens, kind of a tight little golf course, and I heard they lengthened it a little bit.   I listened to the field talk about it yesterday.   I'm curious to see what it looks like.

Q.   I can't imagine there's a U.S. Open course you wouldn't like.   Go out there and have some fun.
BOO WEEKLEY:   I appreciate it.
