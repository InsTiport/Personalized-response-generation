   BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, that was a pretty clutch putt there at the end. I kind of lost concentration there in about the middle of my round. I don't know if it was because I ain't played enough or what's been going on, but I just kind of lost it. I lost my main focus, and all of a sudden I kind of regained it, and kind of like figured, okay, well, let's try to make some better strokes is what we're trying to do. At least if we're going to get beat, let's make sure we get beat by doing it this way. 
 Joe said something to me, and it was kind of like, oh, here we go, and it was off to the races.

 Q. I remember a year ago in this event you weren't even sure how match play worked at times, and now look at you, a Ryder Cup winner and onto the second round this year. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, I'm very fortunate. Justin played pretty well early in the round. I was 3-up and shouldn't have been nowhere near there. I should have been maybe 1-up.

 Q. I didn't see you tee off on the first hole. Did you ride the pony?
 BOO WEEKLEY: I didn't ride no pony. I ain't riding it until I think it's the appropriate time.
