 Q. What's going on?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Man, I left a lot out there today. I hit the ball really good, just didn't get it in the hole enough. On the front side I know I left three out there outside of five foot. 

 Q. You got the one in on the last hole, though?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, I got the one in on the last hole. It's always good to end with a birdie on the last hole, but it's the point when you get done you could have easily shot 6- or 7-under.

 Q. And yet when you go to bed tonight you're certainly going to be within shouting distance of the guys at the top of this leaderboard. Nice to be back in contention, I would imagine?
 BOO WEEKLEY: It is. This year has been crazy. It's been one of them crazy years. I struggled with my shoulder coming out, and didn't believe it and started working out, started getting healthy again. Now I feel like I could make the right swings. And just get that putter hot and I think I'll be back in the circle.

 Q. Have you ever seen a nicer morning than this Friday morning at Hilton Head?
 BOO WEEKLEY: No, it was pretty cool. It was a little foggy, but overall it was great. The no see 'ems weren't out, that's even better. But it's always great to come back here. It's a very pretty place.

 Q. What are you going to do the rest of the day?
 BOO WEEKLEY: I don't know. I've got my kids here. I don't know what we're going to do. 
 We might go around to the beach and hang out a little bit and let them hang out in the sand.

 Q. Sounds like a fun afternoon. And Boo Weekley is back in contention at the Verizon.
