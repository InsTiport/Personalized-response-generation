 Q. You've got the camo on, a couple up-and-downs there on the first two holes out of the sand. You should have your Desert Storm stuff on. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: You ain't lying. The way I started today, it was ugly. But I kind of held in there, you know. We're still making some bad swings right now, and I'm just trying to get it figured out.

 Q. Is that because of your injury?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yes, sir, a lot of it is. It's just because I got lazy on my right side and just dropping and hitting the ball on my left side. So a lot of it is my injury.

 Q. We saw some swings, saw you at TPC where you had to quit there, and it really had to be hurting bad there. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: It was. Unfortunately we had to withdraw from there. But that's just part of life and part of golf.

 Q. Well, you played well today, 3-under par, four birdies, one bogey. You've got to be happy with that. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: Oh, I'm ecstatic. The last week I played solid, kind of come in with a good vibe coming in, and just hoping I can carry it over.
