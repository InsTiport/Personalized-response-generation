 Q.   The conditions and the course and the pin placements, you'd like to do better, but is that something you expect pretty much all day?   
BOO WEEKLEY:   I don't.   I'm not -- I'm just struggling right now. I'm not hitting it on all cylinders.   Awesome some place to play.   The weather was a perfect as compared to what it's been in the past, you know.   Kind of disappointed just because I didn't actually perform as well as I wanted.  
   
 Q.   Did you get anything out of this week that can help you next week?  
BOO WEEKLEY:   No.   Not as bad as I'm hitting right now.   No, I didn't -- I really didn't find nothing.   That's what I'm hoping I could maybe find something for -- before I tee it up next Thursday.  
   
 Q.   People trying to use this course because the way it plays so tight.  
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yeah.   I mean the wind is blowing round here, the ball is flying pretty good, you know, and it is to the advantage to come here and play it and then get ready to go up there because it is a tighter little golf course.  
   
 Q.   Your mindset going into next week now, I know you're not where you want it to be.  
BOO WEEKLEY:   It will turn.   It will change.   It can either go good or bad.   Get worse than what it is or get better than what it is.   Never know.  
   
 Q.   Knowing it's a Major change your mindset?  
BOO WEEKLEY:   No, just another golf tournament.  
   
 Q.   Unless you win it, of course.  
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yes, sir.
