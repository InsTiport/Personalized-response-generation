Q.   Bogey free Sunday.   Check got bigger today.   Good playing?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Thank you.   Yeah, I played good all week.   Putting well.   Didn't drive the ball as well as I wanted there the first three days and kind of worked on some things yesterday and it kind of came together today. 

Q.   You made fewer bogeys than anybody in the field this week.   Are the birdies coming too for you?
BOO WEEKLEY:   I hope.   So I'm putting the ball good.   I've been rolling it all over hole this week and I ain't disappointed the way it turned out. 
But at the same time, I would love to see a couple of them fall, because I would loved to have seen what would have happened much.

Q.   Any hunting invitations this week?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Actually, I did, I got one for next year when I come back I can go up there and hunt and which would be cool.   But I think I need to focus a little more on golf.   Hunting can come a little later.
