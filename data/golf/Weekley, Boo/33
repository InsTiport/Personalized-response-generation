Q.   You bogey the first two but then I was looking at the numbers you threw in an 18‑footer and 25‑footer, talk about this good round you had today. 
BOO WEEKLEY:   I got off to a little shaky start.   Hitting in the dark read out of the gate, kind of didn't know where the ball is going.   It's a day when I got a little more warmed up, got a little more comfortable with what I was doing and what I've been practicing and it just turned out like you see, it turned out good. 

Q.   Talk about the stretch of four birdies in a row. 
BOO WEEKLEY:   I got in there close, right now my putter is feeling good and if I can get it feeling good and keep it feeling good, I think I'll be right there at the at that point.

Q.   Talk about the conditions, you get to play the ball up, how much does that help?
BOO WEEKLEY:   It helps a bunch, especially the first three or four holes for me, which I didn't hit a fairway, so I was struggling there, right out of the gate.   But it helps, but at the same time, you know, having to hit it with the mud all over it, that ain't no fun, because you're guessing the whole time.   There ain't no way the scoring will be what it was if we were playing it down.

Q.   And going into tomorrow?
BOO WEEKLEY:   I'm up, I'm pumped. 

Q.   How good is it to be back here? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   It's good.   I mean, you know, it's just another golf course.   I got fond memories of here.   I've got one bad one but other than that, it's all good.   But really it wasn't a bad one.   I just choked.   That's the bottom line of it.   I have a 3‑footer to win and I just choked, 30‑footer out of the gate; that's all I had to do was 2‑putt from 30 feet and I just choked.

Q.   What's been the difference?
BOO WEEKLEY:   I've been working real hard.   We've just been trying to find some small things in and out that can help me and the thing is, pacing my putters, the way I stroke the ball, it's slowing my putter face down a little bit to keep me from   popping it and getting my right hand involved and breathing a little bit. 
Kind of like when I'm shooting my guns long range; I have to take a deep breath and excel and blow it out and then pull the trigger.   And that's what we try to work on a little bit, Scott Hamilton, my coach, he's kind of helped me on that side of it to get me to realize, get it more natural where it just flows instead of just sitting there, you tense up. 

Q.   Talk about the up‑and‑downs you ve had. 
BOO WEEKLEY:   It's just part of golf.   Talk to everybody out here‑‑ it's tough when you have to write letters.   And thank the good Lord that I have been friendly enough, and been an outgoing guy to a lot of these tournaments.   I've done about everything they have asked me to do, to let me in like last year, because I was playing on all sponsor exemptions and everything that I could do to get in.   I got in enough just to keep my card and it's an honor to be able to say that they called me up and asked me to play that many times. 

Q.   It looked like you were doing something different with your putting grip?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Well, we tried to take a little more pressure off my right hand.   This putter here, the one I putted with today is just a regular length putter but the one I practice with, we cut it off about halfway down where I'm getting a little more under the metal so I'm taking my right hand out of it and taking the pressure out of it.

Q.   And exhaling to help you‑‑
BOO WEEKLEY:   Just breathing properly more or less.   

Q.   Last fall, when we spoke, you were very frustrated but also you were highly motivated; you were really motivated to get your game back.   How is your confidence?
BOO WEEKLEY:   My confidence is getting there.   My swing is starting to come around.   I'm actually healthy right now.   I feel good.   I'm not eating good but I feel good.   But I mean, other than that, everything's going in the right place. 

Q.   Shoulder is not hurting? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   No, sir.

Q.   How much pressure is there being on sponsor exemptions? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   It's a lot of pressure because you're having to‑‑ you play it from week‑to‑week, anyways, you know what I mean, and you get in, you're not 100 percent you're going to be in the next one, because it's kind of like you set your schedule to where you can at least be out there for three or four weeks at a time.   It's kind of frustrating, and at the same time I'm honored that they give me that many starts.

Q.   Compare that pressure to the pressure to play well or the pressure coming down on a Sunday in the last couple holes?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Pressure's pressure.   People hold it different ways.   The only pressure there is what pressure you put on yourself, you know what I mean.   I think that the more you relax and the more you‑‑ with the breathing things I'm doing right now‑‑ everybody holds pressure different in their mind.   I didn't feel like I had a lot of pressure because the worst thing that can happen is I go back to the Nationwide Tour, the Web.com Tour, and play my way back again.   That's my thought and that's what I was thinking.

Q.   Looks like you have a new guy on the bag?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yeah, Barry, he was caddying for Blake Adams and Blake had to have hip surgery.   Me and my caddie, John, he's a good caddie everything and, we were just having some problems and we just couldn't quite get it to flow the way my game was going. 
So I asked Barry if he would be interested in trying it, and thank goodness‑‑ not good for Blake, but it was good for me, and Barry. 

Q.   He knows your game pretty well?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yeah, we play a lot of practice rounds together.   Me and Blake are good friends, so it's pretty good to have somebody who kind of knows who you are.   We have a lot in common, we fish a lot and we do a lot of things together. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BOO WEEKLEY:   There was a moccasin on the 5th green‑‑ if it would have been hotter, somebody could have stepped right by and bit him.   He blended in perfectly with the grass, wasn't but about 18 inches long, but he was good enough that he could have bit you and hurt you pretty bad. 
A guy come running up to us right before we teed off and when we got done I told the guy not to worry about it‑‑ I took my driver and turned it over and just moved him. 

Q.   What sort of things have you done that have helped other than just playing golf to help get exemptions and keep getting exemptions? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   Be yourself, that's the way I look at it.   Be who you really are.   I'm an outgoing guy.   I enjoy people.   I grew up, my dad was a pharmacist and I grew up with people coming and going in the business that he ran, so you kind of learn to mingle with everybody, doesn't matter if they are rich or poor, you can hang out with whoever.   That's kind of what my old man taught me and my mom taught me was to fit in everywhere you go, and I can do that. 

Q.   Turkey season opens in a couple weeks in your neck of the woods, you going to take time off for that?
BOO WEEKLEY:   No, I'm not much on them turkeys.   I have done it a bunch but I don't have time, I'm more worried about golf.   If I can get this taken care of, I can turkey hunt the rest of my life.   That's my whole goal is if I can just get everything taken care of out here right now, I can do all the hunting and taking my kids and everything and show them how to do it. 

Q.   Can you just talk about the first two holes?   I know you said you teed off in the dark?
BOO WEEKLEY:   The first hole I hit 3‑wood there and it started right and just hit the left edge of the bunker and let the wind push it back in the fairway.   The wind, I reckon I had a little cut on the ball, I don't know, and the next hole I turned it over just a little too much and the wind kind of beat it down into the left rough.   I hit two good putts.   I just misread them both.
