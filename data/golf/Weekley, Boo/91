  Q.  First trip to the Accenture Match Play.  You get your win on Day One.  Martin did everything he could, didn't he?   
 BOO WEEKLEY:  He did coming down the stretch.  He's a real solid player, good player.  He's young, he's got a long fortune in this game here.   
  
  Q.  You birdied, I think, the first four on the back.  Talk about what you had working there.   
 BOO WEEKLEY:  I just started swinging again.  I've been struggling a little bit playing lately as I'm playing in the last -- I took two weeks off and I just got to struggling, and I went up and had a lesson from a buddy of mine, Mark Blackman, and we kind of worked on some things trying to help me keep from pull hooking it, and that's been what I've struggling with.  And on the front nine that's what I struggled with is I didn't have the pull hook and I was pushing it.   
 I finally made a good swing, and I was like, wow, that's what I should feel like, and then I went on pretty good.   
  
  Q.  What happened on the last hole?  Did Martin skip one or one roll back at him?   
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Yeah, he chipped it up there and it grabbed, and then it didn't quite make it up onto the flat and it just turned and rolled back down.   
  
  Q.  So it wasn't a one-foot shot?   
 BOO WEEKLEY:  No, he hit a good shot, he was just unfortunate.  It checked on him instead of skipping like they've been doing all day for us.   
  
  Q.  How do you like match play?   
 BOO WEEKLEY:  It's interesting.  I mean, it's no different than regular play.  You've just got to go out and play golf.
