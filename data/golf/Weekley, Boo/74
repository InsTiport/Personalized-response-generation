  Q. It's a good position to be in.   
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, it is a good position. Your putter gets hot, you know, you never know what can happen.   
  
  Q. Have you been playing very much?   
 BOO WEEKLEY: More or less, before I went over to Birkdale I think I played about four or five times before I went over to Birkdale. And just played, I didn't actually go out and actually work at it and practice, I just went out and played with my buddies.   
 But the last, since last week to now my game has done like a 180 seriously, because I couldn't find it last week and then this week at least I'm hitting it a little straighter and hitting my irons a little more solidly.   
  
  Q. What's your schedule from here on?  
 BOO WEEKLEY: I know I'm going to go home next week and then come back out for the playoffs.   
 I'll play in all them, you know. So that's right now. I don't plan too far a head, you know.
