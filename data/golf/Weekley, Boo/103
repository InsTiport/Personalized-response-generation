 Q. Great round considering the weather over the last six holes or so? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Yeah what about this weather eh? 

 Q. Classic Scottish summer. 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Well that's why I came over here - to see what this is really like and I am really enjoying it. 

 Q. What are your impressions? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  It's great over here, especially this place, although I would say that this place is more American than anything else, but it's been real nice to come over here and see you guys' culture and everything and I am just looking forward to next week now. 

 Q. Do you think you can prepare well for The Open here this week? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  I think so. I know the courses this week and next are going to be different but I came here to play this event and next week, and it is going to help me acclimatize to the conditions of the country and everything else. 

 Q. You also have a great chance to win here now? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Well we'll see. I'm just going to go one shot at a time and see what happens come Sunday afternoon.
