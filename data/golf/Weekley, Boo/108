 Q.  Is the wind really affecting you? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  You've just got to think a little harder.  You've got to play a little different shot.  Where you've got to think, okay, I've got 164 hole, but it's playing two and a half clubs different, and if the ball gets up in the air the wind is liable to knock it down and you'll come up even shorter than what you thought. 

 Q.  How do you like this course? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  I like it.  I like it. 

 Q.  Just a general recap of the round, your highs, lows, ups and downs? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Well, eagled No. 2 right out of the gate.  I had about a 40-footer there.  It was one of those, oh, my goodness, where did this come from?  But just cruised around and I made a couple extra -- some more putts, hit some good shots.  I got all I could get out of my game today.  I just made two hiccups, a bogey on 16, I think, a par 5 there.  I hit my second shot just in the wrong spot and just left myself a tough one there to get it up-and-down. 
 I don't know, on No. 8, I just hit a bad chip there.  Easy shot, just a bad chip.
