 Q.  Just talk about your week.  Did you have fun out here this week? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  Oh, I've had a lot of good days.  I had fun.  It was a great tournament and great place to play it in. 

 Q.  You played pretty well? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  I played good.  Even today I played solid, I just putted real bad.  You can't putt it the way I putted and expect to win. 

 Q.  Anything out there today that happened that was a turning point in the match for you? 
 BOO WEEKLEY:  No, just didn't putt good the whole day.
