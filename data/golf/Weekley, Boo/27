Q.   Boo, it seemed like today was just the kind of day where everything was just like this much off?
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yeah, I was a little off.   I had some good looks early in the round, and just kind of got down on myself with the putter.   I was putting the ball so well the first two days, and then all of a sudden just couldn't make nothing.   It kind of got to me a little bit and cost a little patience out there.

Q.   What's it going to take?   You've had a little bit of struggles on the weekend and almost like maybe you're trying too hard to get it done. 
BOO WEEKLEY:   Yeah, I think that's a lot of it.   Like I said, I think if I had a little momentum and made a putt right out of the gate or something small, it would be on the good side.   I think I could kind of get the joke started and get right there.

Q.   So what would be the game plan for tomorrow? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   Just hit it a little better than I did today, putt it a little better.   But, you know, it's just golf.   I enjoy playing with Lucas.   He played good today.   He's struggled a little bit with the putter going down the stretch, but I'm hoping to catch up with him.

Q.   How much more enjoyable is it?   You and Lucas are good buddies, your caddies get along.   That whole group is like the big old boys.   How much more fun is that? 
BOO WEEKLEY:   It's fun.   Everybody out here, I respect everyone that's out here.   It's all business.   If they don't want to talk to you, they won't talk to you.   But I'm kind of like the guy that likes to hang out and talk and shoot the bull. 
Sometimes it happens where you don't have somebody like that.   That's just part of golf.
