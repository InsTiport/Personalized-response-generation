   BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, the first couple holes on the greens were a little beat up. I thought I hit some good putts there, you know, but I was nervous. It's been a while since I've been in this position, you know, and had an opportunity to do it. I admit, I was just nervous.
 Once I settled down a little bit I started hitting a couple better shots. The putter, for some reason they just didn't want to fall today. I putted the ball pretty good today. Just in and out.

 Q. That happened to a lot of people today. You're gonna be in the same situation tomorrow: end of the day and greens are gonna be a little beat up. Just hang in through the breaks and give it your best shot. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: That's all you can do. That's just part of golf. You know, I'm happy to be in the position I'm in. At least I got the opportunity to be in the back of the group, you know, playing. Better than the front of the group where you have to catch up so much to make some money.
 But, um, it was a good day overall. I had a good time. You know, Jeff, I got to watch him play some good golf. He made some good putts coming down the stretch on the back. There. 
 It's just golf. We're gonna go out there tomorrow and see if we can do the same.

 Q. I think you kept him loose. I think he appreciates that. Go get 'em tomorrow. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yes, sir. Thank you.
