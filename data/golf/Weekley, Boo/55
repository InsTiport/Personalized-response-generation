 Q. Boo, you always make it exciting. You made this round pretty exciting, too. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yeah, I put a lot of pressure on myself on the first couple of holes and it kind of caught up with me there. And I've got some issues with that putter right now. I can't get it to feel right.

 Q. Seve once said at Augusta, I miss, I miss, I miss, I make when he 4 putted a hole. Is that what happened to you at 9?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yes, more or less. I had three good putts there. I knew. I hit it right where I was hitting. That's just part of the game. I think that makes number four this year.

 Q. Three good birdies on the backside?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yes. Seemed like I had to miss the green to make the birdie. It was pretty good. Overall, I mean, I was glad I made the cut to be able to stay for the weekend. You never know what can happen on the weekend.

 Q. You get that little chipper going from off the edges of the green, some good things can still happen?
 BOO WEEKLEY: Yes, sir, that and let's get that flash tape working. Yesterday I felt like I left a bunch out there. And today you take that 4-putt away and throw a couple of holes in there where I made birdie I'm back in on this thing.

 Q. Go practice on it, go work on it and we'll see you tomorrow. 
 BOO WEEKLEY: Thank you, sir.
