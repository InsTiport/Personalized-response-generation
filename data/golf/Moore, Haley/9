 Q.  Hayley, tell me about how the round went today and kind of describe what you were feeling while you were out there?  
HAYLEY MOORE: The round was pretty steady today.  It was tough out there.  Front and back nine is a lot more tougher than the front nine.  I wasn't very patient on the back nine.  I had two back-to-back bogeys, but to finish with a birdie just gave me more confidence going into tomorrow.  I was just having fun out there, just enjoying this experience.  Like it's just amazing to be here.   
 Q.  How was the Chairman's dinner last night?  
HAYLEY MOORE: It was awesome.  The food was absolutely amazing, and just driving into Magnolia Lane, I was pretty speechless.  I was like, "Oh, my gosh!"  And then the shopping spree was really fun.  That was so fun.   
 Q.  What's the best thing you bought last night?  
HAYLEY MOORE: Probably what we got, what we were able to get for free.  We got two polos, a sweater and a hat.  There were different designs you could choose from, and that's pretty cool.  Then a lot of my friends from home wanted some stuff, so I helped them pick out.  They got some hats and we got a Masters flag to put in our house.  That's pretty awesome.   
 Q.  What's your mind-set going into tomorrow?  What are you feeling going into tomorrow?  
HAYLEY MOORE: Again, just to stay steady.  There's a lot of golf.  Anything can happen and just if I have a bad hole, I have time to make it up and everything.
