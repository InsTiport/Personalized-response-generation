Q. So walk me through your round today.  How did it go?
HALEY MOORE: It was up and down.  I started on the back nine.  I finished at 1-under.  I had a couple birdie chances but they just didn't fall today.  There were some tricky pins out there with a lot of slopes on the back nine, which was the front nine.  The wind really picked up on a couple holes, so I just told myself, just to stay patient and stay steady, and everybody has to deal with the wind.
Overall, I'm pretty happy and I'm going to be playing on Saturday.  So that's a major key.
Q. How does it feel going into Saturday being in the top spots for some of the players?
HALEY MOORE: It's definitely pretty awesome just because it's like no matter where the top 30 finish, it's history being made, and just to be able to go walk Augusta two times is probably going to be more than what I ever thought.
Q. What are your feelings being in the first field ever for ANWA?
HALEY MOORE: I'm grateful and I'm blessed and I'm just so amazed by everything that's been happening.  I'm just going to soak it all in and just hope -- and just have fun.
