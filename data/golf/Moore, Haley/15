Q. You're still moving; I guess you got off to a good start today with a couple of birdies right away?
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, right away I was just striking the ball good again and just hitting it in the right place.  These conditions were super soft, so you can go at the pins and it'll stop.  This afternoon it's probably going to be about the same conditions, so just stick with my game plan that I have.
Q. How long were your birdies, your first two holes?
HALEY MOORE: They were probably about five, six feet.  The first hole was probably about three feet.  It was conceded.  And then the second hole was about four or five feet.
Q. How do you feel about the way you're playing?  Are you right where you want to be?
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, I'm right where I want to be.  I'm just -- I think I'm just hitting the ball -- I'm kind of hitting the ball really well right now, and I'm just hoping I can keep it up.  But like my putting can be a little better, but I'm just hanging in there, staying patient all day.
Q. This morning when it was raining, I thought about you.  I said, this is a Haley Moore kind of day where it's longer so it's going to play a little favorable for someone who's a long hitter, right?
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, it definitely favored me because nobody was getting any roll, so on these long holes if I can have some mid-irons in and just hit them as close to the pin as I could, I knew that I could possibly win the hole or just -- I knew I could possibly win the hole.
Q. And moving forward, you've got another match to play; what do you have to do to keep going?
HALEY MOORE: Just got to stick with everything, just keep hitting good shots and just staying patient out there because birdies will happen, and anything can happen in match play.
