 Q.  First off, how cool was it to play the weekend here and to be here after playing the junior event on Monday?  HALEY MOORE: It was just so fun.  Every day I met new people, and I just had a great time.  Friday was a little nerve-racking, but I was able to get it done to make the cut.  So this weekend, Saturday and Sunday I just told myself go out there, have fun and just enjoy it as long as it lasts.   Q.  How much has your social media been blowing up since then?  HALEY MOORE: A lot, and I've been getting a bunch of messages from people I don't even know.  So they're just saying how proud they are of me, and, yeah, it's really nice.   Q.  What do your classmates think of this, on national TV?  HALEY MOORE: I mean, I haven't really talked to them, but they probably, when I go back to school on Tuesday, because we were on spring break, they'll probably say something.  Because there are some people at my school that think golf is not a sport.  And I say, yeah, it is, because you have to practice really hard and stuff.   Q.  What can this do for your confidence going forward in the game?
