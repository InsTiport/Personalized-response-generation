 Q.  I heard a couple cheers over there and you come away with a 3-under day. How did you conclude your round today?  
HALEY MOORE: I concluded with a birdie-birdie finish. I was getting close out there. I had a lot of opportunities. Just weren't going in.   
I was just staying patient out there just because it was pretty -- conditions were better today. Just a little for chilly, so we knew that it would be a little bit of a battle out there with the wind.   
So just kind of battled my way in; in good position just for tomorrow. Just be patient out there.   
 Q.  You're one of the lowest rounds of the day right now. Not a lot of people shooting under par. Why do you think it's been a challenge for some of these players out here?  
HALEY MOORE: I just think with the a little bit of the colder conditions the ball is not flying as far, and there are some pins today tucked in spots.   
So if you're having a longer shot in, you kind of just have to plan it, kind of just bail it out, and have a long putt and try to two-putt. You can't really attack a lot out there.   
 Q.  Seems like your entourage is growing bigger every day here. What will it mean tomorrow to take home and LPGA Tour card in front of people that support you and love you?  
HALEY MOORE: It's definitely pretty special. Just coming all the way from stage one just to be here and enjoying this experience and learning everything, it's just pretty awesome, so just going to try to enjoy tomorrow. I mean, and still play some good golf because it's not over yet. But, yeah.
