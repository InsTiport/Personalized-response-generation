 Q.  A little tougher playing in the afternoon with the wind out here.  
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, definitely, yeah.   
 Q.  So you got off to a little bit of a bumpy start.  Just talk me through your round.  
HALEY MOORE: Just up and down, like grinding out there.  I knew that there would be bogeys out there with this wind, and I'd tell myself just to stay calm because there's a bunch of holes left.  I came back with a birdie, which probably could have been an eagle, but then just stayed steady after that.  Just came out with a couple more birdies, so that was good.   
 Q.  So you're still 4-under over two rounds, so that's good.  That's nice for a good seeding in match play.  What's your perspective heading into tomorrow's round?  
HALEY MOORE: Just being steady again and just playing aggressive on holes that I can attack, because the greens are definitely going to be a little faster tomorrow because most tee times will be in the morning.  I'll have a good chance to hit some good putts out there.
