 Q.  I know you're a little disappointed, but overall do you feel good about the way you played this week?  
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, I feel good.  It'll give me a lot of momentum in a week and a half going up to my hometown for the Women's Am, so looking forward to that.   
 Q.  It's right in your backyard, right?  
HALEY MOORE: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  You played a lot of golf today and have to go into that extra hole.  Walk me through how long was your putt on 18 in regulation?  
HALEY MOORE: I mean, I was over the green, and I chipped it to about a foot and a half.  I almost chipped it in.  Yeah, and then on the extra hole, I just hit my first putt a little too firm because I thought with that rain shower we had, it would be slower and wet.   
 Q.  You've had a good run here in the U.S. Girls' Junior.  I know it's emotional to leave, but do you leave with fond memories?  
HALEY MOORE: Mm-hmm, yeah.  This is probably like the best tournament put on for juniors, and I just say good luck to all the juniors next year and whoever wins this week.
