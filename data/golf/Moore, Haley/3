Q. So we switched to a different course. You played No. 8 yesterday in the pro-am and won the pro-am. What was it like gearing up for the second week of Q-Series?
HALEY MOORE: I mean, this is my first time like being at Q-Series, so I've just always heard it's a grind. Both courses, they definitely both have a different layout to them.
When I just played a couple practice rounds here I just felt good with this course layout. Just kind of yesterday I think playing in the pro-am just kind of didn't really have me think about my last four rounds. Just thought of it as a brand new tournament to play.
Q. What is it about this course that's set up so well for you in this 6-under round here?
HALEY MOORE: I think it was just the way -- I mean, my ball striking was great today. There were some pretty good attackable pins out there. These greens have a lot of slopes to them, and so that's where some of these pins were. You could definitely use slope to get it to go close and around there.
Q. I heard also that someone is following you today that maybe wasn't here last week. Do tell.
HALEY MOORE: Yeah, so I was just sitting down last night after dinner and someone comes behind me and starts messing with me. I thought it was my mom, but then I turn around and it was my dad. So he came in and surprised me, which is pretty awesome.
So it was pretty cool for him just to come out and see this because it's such a grind out here. Yeah.
Q. How do you think that helped your confidence today?
HALEY MOORE: I think it really helped me just having my family here who can definitely support me. He was on the bag with me at stage one, so he knows that I played well out there and that I can definitely do it out here, too.
