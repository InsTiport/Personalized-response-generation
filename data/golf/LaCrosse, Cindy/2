Q. 67.  That's your best round in a while.  How did it feel?  What was working so well?
CINDY LACROSSE: I got off to a really good start.  I was just -- I don't know.  I got a lesson last weekend, and so I kind of have low expectations this week.
I was really trying hard on each shot to kind of do what my coach, Justin Sheehan, told me to do last week.  So really helped me to focus on one shot at a time.
Then the greens are perfect, so I made some good putts, too.  I was able to hold on.  I was a little nervous on the back nine, but it was good.
Q. What were some of the things were working on with your coach?
CINDY LACROSSE: Swing-wise just to get a little more round.  I get a little vertical and long.  So I had to do a good rehearsal in my practice swing, and then just try and feel that and trust that if I do it well it'll be okay.
Q. Do you think this course sets up for you to kind of breakthrough this week?
CINDY LACROSSE: Hopefully.  I think it'll play a lot different as the weekend goes on with how hot it's going to be.  It's already firming up compared to the last couple days.
I really think each day is going to play a little, which will be good for me to keep it one shot at a time, I guess.
Q. Are you relaxed?  I know it's Thursday, but are you comfortable near the top of the leaderboard?
CINDY LACROSSE: I haven't been there in a while so not really.  No, I mean, who knows what's going to happen?
Yeah, there is a lot of holes left.  But I'm glad.  I mean, it's nice to not have to play catchup I guess after one day.
Yeah, just a really nice start, and I'll see what else I can do, I guess.
