Q.  On a day like this what do you do now today?
KATE GOLDEN:  Find a paper, look at the movie schedules and get my putter out of bag storage, putt in the room a little bit, just kind of hang out.

I'll start all over again tomorrow.
Q.  Did you play today?
KATE GOLDEN:  No, I was not supposed to go until 1:15.
Q.  A couple of players out there, Natalie, Laura Diaz they are playing well, other players' scores are higher today.  How does that register for your factor?

You didn't have to go out there at all?
KATE GOLDEN:  Yeah, sometimes it is just kind of luck of the draw.  Sometimes you get on the bad end of it and sometimes you end up on the good end of it.

It ends up even at the end of the year.

When you are playing well, you always want to keep playing.  I think they will be okay with kind of washing this one and starting over again tomorrow.
Q.  Are you kind of glad you didn't have to go out there today?
KATE GOLDEN:  Oh yeah, no doubt about it.
