 Q. What was the difference today? I mean, what was separating you from winning and losing? 
 JAY HWANG: You mean from matches or? 

 Q. Yeah, did you not putt well? Did he putt better than you? 
 JAY HWANG: Yeah, he putt better than me. I missed couple short shots. I don't think he missed any putt inside 10 feet. I don't know. 
 And I missed a couple of putts inside 5 feet.

 Q. Just what was the experience like playing in the final match? 
 JAY HWANG: It's actually my first time back there, you know. And I play in front of everybody. But I should be here a lot better. I just focus on my match. 

 Q. When you went into the water on the 14th hole, were you just thinking like, oh, man. Did that just serve as a crusher for you? 
 JAY HWANG: It was just very sad. I didn't give up. I just didn't think it would go into the water, you know. I thought it might be a good shot. And then it fell in the water. 

 Q. You said you had some bad brakes. 
 JAY HWANG: Yeah, I had three very good putt, and didn't even go in. I feel not very good about this, because I really think that goes in, and it just not go in.
