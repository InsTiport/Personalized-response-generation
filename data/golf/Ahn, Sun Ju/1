Q.   The decision has been made that there is going to be a two‑shot penalty; it's unfortunate but it's part of the day. 
SUN JU AHN:   Yeah, it's disappointing but it's my mistake and something that I have to follow the rules of the game.   I still have a day to go and I have to stay focused and try any best tomorrow.

Q.   I know there was no intent, but do you understand the rule and did you understand the rule when you were in the process of it? 
SUN JU AHN:   Yeah, I didn't know about the rule but all I was trying to do was make a stance.   I'm surprised by it but if that's the rule, I just have to abide by it and just refocus.

Q.   Can you take us through what happened on 18 in your opinion? 
SUN JU AHN:   You know, the ball was placed on a very upslope lie, so it was hard to make a stance.   So what I was trying to do was fix a stance but after the review it was determined that I used my feet to try to make an even lie.   But you know, my intent wasn't to break the rules.   It was just to set my feet firm in the sand just to be able to make the shot.   But if that's the rule, there was no intent and I can't do anything about it.

Q.   Do you feel it's a little unfair?
SUN JU AHN:   I mean, it's the rules.   I'm a player and I have to abide by the rules.   So I can't say it would be‑‑ it would be unfair for me to say it's unfair.   But the truth is that I was trying to, the intent was to make a stance, not break the rules.   I just have to abide by the rules.

Q.   Does it give you motivation now for tomorrow? 
SUN JU AHN:   I'll have to sleep over it and find out tomorrow morning whether it's going to motivate me or not.   All I can do is do my best.   I know I'm not that far off, still in the game, so we'll just have to see tomorrow. 

Q.   And nothing like this has happened to you before? 
SUN JU AHN:   No, this is the first time.
