 Q.   You're tied for the best round of the tournament, what was the key for your success today?   
SUN JU AHN:   I think too much think yesterday and I had lots of stress and pressure.   But today I played very naturally and very happy to play everything.   
   
 Q.   How do you see this golf course, Royal Birkdale?   Does it fit your eye well?   What are your impressions of this golf course?   
SUN JU AHN:   So this course is very difficult but very nice course.   And I can't understand something‑‑ wind is very strong, right and left, but it is very, very nice course.   
   
 Q.   Have you made any recent changes to your golf game to your swing or your strategy, your equipment?   Any changes recently?   
SUN JU AHN:   I haven't changed anything about my swing.   I'm very careful about to hit straight in the middle.
