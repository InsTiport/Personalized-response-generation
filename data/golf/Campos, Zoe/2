Q. What was it like out there today?  Was it just an unbelievable experience?
ZOE CAMPOS: Yeah, totally.  I really love the course.  It was like no other course I've played before, and it was really challenging.  But, you know, I think I can get around the greens and around the fairways, too, so it wasn't as hard as it seemed, but it was nice.
Q. You're one of the youngest players in the field, how does it feel to actually tee off on a course like this?
ZOE CAMPOS: Being the youngest, it means a whole lot to me, like seeing how my game is right now at this point, being in this kind of field, especially at the highest amateur level, it means like so much, just being here, especially at this course.
Q. In your past, you showed that before a final round, you can rally and maybe take the lead.  What do you prefer, leading or chasing the lead?
ZOE CAMPOS: For me, I really like to chase the lead.  It motivates me more to play better out there.  So I like chasing the lead better.
Q. Do you feel like you've learned a lot out here today about this course?
ZOE CAMPOS: Yeah, definitely.  You really have to be on point with your game and everything.  You know, it's not a course where you can like miss.  You can miss a shot and you have like an easy outcome out of it, but yeah.
Q. Is it the toughest course you've ever played?
ZOE CAMPOS: Definitely.
Q. Are you on spring break yet?
ZOE CAMPOS: Yeah, this is my spring break right now.
Q. So just talk to me about playing Augusta National on your spring break?
ZOE CAMPOS: It's probably the best spring break I've ever had, yeah.
Q. How different is this course from the one you played the last two days?
ZOE CAMPOS: It's a lot different.  You know, I mean, the greens are kind of similar, but the layout and especially this being a lot hillier, and you know, you have to be more precise with your shots.
