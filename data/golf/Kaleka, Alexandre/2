 Q.   Tell us about a 6â€‘under par 66, because that's a lovely knock around here.   
    ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, it's good, everybody knew that it was a nice day, very quiet, no wind, so you can always shoot a good score.   66 was my goal today, so I'm pretty happy.   I played solid all day.   I holed a few putts and hit my irons really well, yeah.   
   
 Q.   That's a tremendous goal to have, going out knowing you want to shoot a 66; is that because you're familiar with the course?   It suits your eye?   
    ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   No, I just think that a good score would be 66.   We had three 66s, one 65, so that was makeable.   Just with a nice day, all the par 5s are almost reachable except 18, so I thought it was possible.  
   
 Q.   It's not your first year but you were out, fell back that little bit and had to work hard to come back.   
    ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, the last two years were a really good experience, especially the first year on Tour.   I didn't play really well, but at the end, I learned a lot of things.   And last year, I played really consistent all year.   So I knew I was ready to go back on Tour.   
   
 Q.   For so many players, that really does work to their advantage, I don't know if you find that with that experience, you feel better second time around.   
    ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, definitely, the first year, you never know how it is exactly on Tour.   You don't really know the guys.   The first time you are on TV, you are with the guys behind you, you don't know what to do.   But you need those tournaments to feel good.   Some guys, they do it quickly.   Others, they need a bit of time like me, yeah.
