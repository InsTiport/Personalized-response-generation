 Q.   What do you feel about a special round like this then, that's a lovely start, isn't it?   
ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, it is.   No bogeys, eight birdies, so that's a dream round.   But yeah, it's always special to play the Old Course, so I'm very pleased with that day and I hope Sunday will be, as well.  
   
 Q.   You're familiar with the place?   You've played this a lot in the past?  
ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, I've played probably 12‑‑ yeah, more than 12 rounds here, so I know the place very well.   
   
 Q.   It is a day when it's really got to be a good, low score, isn't it, beautiful weather conditions?  
ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, especially for us, because we played‑‑ we tee off the 10th and we played the back nine with no wind, so that's a big advantage.   Normally it's into the wind, and then once we've played the front nine, it was downbreeze.   So everything was perfect for a good score.  
   
 Q.   Looked like there was so many opportunities out there, and you just had to take them?  
ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Yeah, yeah, because the pin position are not that tough.   So you're not going to hit it close on every hole, but you're going to have a lot of 15‑ or 20‑foot putts, and if you make half of them, that's pretty good.   
   
 Q.   General terms, how have you been playing?   How have you been scoring?   
ALEXANDRE KALEKA:   Scoring‑wise, it wasn't that good, but I wasn't playing very bad, but I missed the last two or three cuts by a few shots, one or two.   So it's been a bit frustrating.   But that's golf.   You have to be patient and wait for your 64 on Thursday on the Old Course.
