 Q.  What was the key to having four birdies on the front?  
MARCUS KINHULT: I holed a long one on the first and the second.  And then hit it close on --   
 Q.  Long putts on the first two?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah.   
 Q.  How far?  
MARCUS KINHULT: 20 and then 35, 40.  And then I had a par on 3.  Good birdie on 4.  And good par on 6.  And then hit it close on 7.   
 Q.  Getting off to that start do you think you'll be able to hold on and make the cut?  
MARCUS KINHULT: I'm not sure.  Now it looks like it's going to be pretty tight around 2-over.  So we'll see.  Hopefully the wind picks up a little bit so the afternoon guys will have a little harder time than we have.   
 Q.  I know on the last hole you were a little short on your chip, can you talk about that hole a little bit?  
MARCUS KINHULT: I hit a good drive.  And then I felt like I hit a good 4-iron, but it went straight through.  I missed the green on the right.  Hit it fat and just missed the putt.
