Q. 4-under par, how pleased are you with how you played today?
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, I'm proud. Shot a good score today. Got into the playoff and made a silly bogey but yeah, I'm happy with the week and how I played. It's a good week. Losing is not all fun but Tommy deserved that. Great up-and-down. Great champion.
Q. This moves you into the Top-10 into the Race to Dubai heading into the DP World. How much of a positive is it getting into the bonus pool and finishing the season on a high?
MARCUS KINHULT: I haven't thought about that. We were 35th going into this week. I guess this secures a couple things for next year. I love coming to Jumeirah and look forward to that. It will be a good week.
Q. How much have you enjoyed your second trip here to Nedbank, considering the last time you were in 70th position, to come runner-up?
MARCUS KINHULT: It's quite an improvement. I look forward to come back next year hopefully and see if we can do better. But I'm happy this week, and especially how last year turned out with that last-place finish. I think we're learning every time we come here. Yeah, I look forward to the next time.
