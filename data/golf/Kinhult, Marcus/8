Q. Marcus, first round 65 here, 7-under.  How did you find conditions today?
MARCUS KINHULT: It was not as tough as I expected honestly.  It was raining a bit throughout the round, and it wasn't that windy.  So I guess it was okay, and I played well, so that makes it easier perhaps.
Q. Back nine usually gets the good press around here, certainly more favored by most golfers and your scorecard would certainly reflect it.  How did you find it?
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, I got going.  I holed a bunch of putts for birdie and for par.  I made some good saves, as well, so that kept me going I think, and yeah, short game and putting is phenomenal today.  That's key.
Q. You had a good finish in Saudi Arabia, Top-20 there and a few missed cuts since then.  How do you feel your game is at the moment?
MARCUS KINHULT: Well, after today, good.  Yesterday, I didn't feel that good.  Actually I got beaten by the amateurs I played with in the Pro-Am, but they played really well.  It's good fun.  I haven't played that well lately, so it was nice to be able to have a good round and hope I can do well the next few days.
Q. Looks like the weather is unfortunately not going to be too great this week.  Is that something you can manage?
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, I think so.  I'm from Sweden.  I don't like it.  It's fine.  If you just stay positive and make some good swings, and you'll be fine, and hole a few putts.
