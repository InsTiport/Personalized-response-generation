 Q.  A lovely 68 today. How was it for you?  
MARCUS KINHULT: It was good. I think I played pretty well today. It wasn't easy in the wind. So yeah, 4-under is a good score, and I'm happy.   
 Q.  What's your mind-set tomorrow? You still in this for the tournament, do you think?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Depends on what the other guys are doing. I guess they have a few more holes left, and I think 16-under is leading now. So yeah, it's a long way off, but you never know. If we can shoot a good one tomorrow, I'll be happy. And we'll see if that will be enough. I guess I will have to shoot a really low one to even have a chance.   
If I can play well tomorrow, I'll be happy, whatever finish we get.
