 Q.  Maybe this course is ripe for the taking.  Tell us how you saw your round today and what do you think about that idea?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Well, the course was -- felt a lot easier today, especially being in the fairway all the time and hitting it in the right spots and I played a lot better.  This is the best round of the week, obviously.  But I think there's going to be a pretty tough challenge for the afternoon guys if the greens get a bit firmer.  There's some pin positions out there I think that the guys will find quite hard.  But it is playable.  And, yeah, I played really well.   
 Q.  Why do you think you were able to navigate it today, what was the difference between this day and the previous round?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Just keeping the ball in the right spots or below the hole, really.  I managed to get some good up-and-downs from I bit easier spots than other days.  And then I just took my chances on the greens really.  I don't know, I probably hit 14 greens in regulation.  So it was a good ball-striking round tee to green and holed a couple of putts, as well.   
 Q.  How important is it for the big picture to shoot 66 on Sunday at Pebble?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Well, hopefully I can take some confidence from that.  And I think just this whole week has been a great experience, my first U.S. Open.  I think I learned a lot.  And I really look forward to try to play here again.   
 Q.  What's next for you, what's on your schedule?  
MARCUS KINHULT: I will have a week off next week, I'm going home tonight actually.  And then I go back to the European Tour again, I play a full schedule there.  And I play three in a row after that week off and try to get my spot for The Open which is in five weeks.  So that's my next mission.
