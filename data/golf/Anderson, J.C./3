Q.   Talk about your round today.   Improved, what, by three?
J.C. ANDERSON:   Yeah, I was three better, but I actually putted better today.   I ended up 7‑over for the tournament, I was 7‑over for nine holes yesterday.   So can I make three quarters of a cut? 
(Laughter.)
No, you know, I did hit two balls in the water today on the same hole.   But other than that it was a better round, a little more solid round than yesterday.   That nine holes yesterday, it's still in the back of my mind today.   It's disappointing to not make the cut here, but at least I came back and didn't mail it in, you know. 

Q.   What was the difference between today and yesterday?
J.C. ANDERSON:   Well, yes, sure, we caught that squall yesterday afternoon in the rain, that was sort of tough.   But you can't complain about the conditions.   Golf course is great, finally got some sun today, so the greens were wonderful today.   It seemed like it was, they seemed a little smoother this morning and the putts were rolling better today. 

Q.   What's kind of your final thoughts or take‑aways from the week?
J.C. ANDERSON:   Well, I'm sad again that I'm not going to play on the weekend in front of, because I got a lot of friend and family here, but I'm glad to see that some of my fellow players, Bob Gaus is probably going to make the cut.   So that's really good.   Good for our section.   And it gives good representation for us.
