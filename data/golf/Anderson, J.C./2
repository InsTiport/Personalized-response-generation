Q.   I guess, first off, finishing off with a birdie has got to be a good feeling?
J.C.ANDERSON:   With that crowd behind 18, yeah, yeah, that was a good feeling.   I hit a good drive and a really good 5‑iron in there, somehow must have misread the putt, because it went in too.

Q.   How long was that?
J.C.ANDERSON:   It was about six feet.

Q.   3‑over for the day, not a bad round?
J.C.ANDERSON:   Yeah, you know, if Oak Hill is going to be gotten, if that's a word, today is the day to get it.   No wind, soft greens, the guys are tearing it up. 
I was a little nervous starting out, couple of three putts, got it over par.   I'm proud of myself, I sort of hung in there and made some good shots coming in.

Q.   Do you feel like you hit the ball well other than some of the putts?
J.C.ANDERSON:   I've hit the ball better, but when I hit it out of play, I seemed like I made some pars from bad drives, so that was really good.   My bogeys were what they call unforced errors.   That is the nature of the game.   To finish with a birdie just makes lunch taste so much better.

Q.   That is really got to give you some confidence going into tomorrow?
J.C.ANDERSON:   It does, it does.   It gives me confidence and I'm one shot better than I was starting on the 18 tee.
