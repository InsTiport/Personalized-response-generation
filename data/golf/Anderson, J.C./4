Q.  You shot a 6-over today.  How did you play?

J.C. ANDERSON:   Scrambling.  Started out striking the ball well but didn't make any birdie putts.  That was frustrating.  You know, I think the harder the golf course, the better I play.  My game is a lot of scrambling, a lot of fairways.  I did that.  I made some great up-and-downs.  A little disappointed how I finished.  I got a little tired.  Overall, it's a tough golf course, you look at the score.

J.C. ANDERSON:   Not bad, I guess. 


Q.  How was the rough? 

J.C. ANDERSON:   Well, they have named it correctly.  It's rough.  Actually I hit some drives so far out of the rough that I had some pretty decent lies.  If you just miss the rough, you're just wedging it out.  I did hit one green today from out of the rough.  It was unbelievable, on No. 5.  I hit it in the rough, and I hit a 6-iron out from a terrible lie and I got it on the green.  That was maybe the highlight of my round. 


Q.  Going into tomorrow, will you change anything? 

J.C. ANDERSON:   Get a little more aggressive on the greens.  The greens scared me a little bit today.  I was playing defensive.  The speed, they were getting faster.  I was a little defensive on the greens.  I had some putts come up to the hole and just die off.  I think I'll be a little more aggressive on the greens tomorrow.
