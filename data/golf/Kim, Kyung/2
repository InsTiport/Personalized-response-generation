  RHONDA GLENN:   Well, how does that sound to you, that you're the national champion?   
KYUNG KIM:   I just can't believe it.   I mean, it was a long week, but to be finally done and to win, it's pretty amazing.   It feels great.   
RHONDA GLENN:   How are your blisters?   
KYUNG KIM:   This leg is better.  
RHONDA GLENN:   I did notice you limping out there.   
KYUNG KIM:   Yeah.   Way better than yesterday, though.   
RHONDA GLENN:   I had you on stroke play at 7‑under par for the two rounds and 10 birdies.   That's a pretty high level.   Have you ever played that well in a tournament before?   
KYUNG KIM:   No.   I didn't know I had 10 birdies.   It's pretty‑‑ that's so much.   
RHONDA GLENN:   What do you think inspired you to get to this level of play?   
KYUNG KIM:   What inspired me?   
RHONDA GLENN:   Yeah, if you've never done that before‑‑  
KYUNG KIM:   Well, I just tried to play one shot at a time, just keep it on the fairway, green, and just make the putt.   A lot of putts fell in today.   
RHONDA GLENN:   Going to your morning round, talk about the first three holes.   
KYUNG KIM:   Yeah, I was just the first to putt.   I was playing it either like inside right or insight left and it just lipped out.   
RHONDA GLENN:   What club did you hit into the green on Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12, and how long were you putts?   
KYUNG KIM:   I can't really remember, but the putts were very long.   I was just trying to lag it up there to just save par, but it just happened to go‑‑  
RHONDA GLENN:   On 9, what did you hit to the green on No.9.  
KYUNG KIM:   I hit a 60‑degree wedge.  
RHONDA GLENN:   How long was your putt?   
KYUNG KIM:   It was a little long, and it went about 25 feet, maybe.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And then on 10 you made a long one, right?   
KYUNG KIM:   A long one.  
RHONDA GLENN:   What did you hit to the green on 10?   
KYUNG KIM:   On 10, I tried to hit a cut 9, but I kind of chunked it, so it went straight left.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And you had about a 40‑footer?   
KYUNG KIM:   Around, yeah.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And what were you thinking on that putt?   
KYUNG KIM:   Just to lag it up there as close as I can.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And‑‑  
KYUNG KIM:   It barely went in.   
RHONDA GLENN:   You had two birdies in a row, were all square again, and then on 11, the par‑4, what did you hit to the green?   
KYUNG KIM:   I hit a 52‑degree wedge, and I hit it short, way short, and I think I had like a 30‑footer.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And what were you trying to do with that lag?   
KYUNG KIM:   Just trying to hit past the hole since it was like an uphill putt, to still give it a chance.  
RHONDA GLENN:   What did you think when that went in?   How did you feel at that point?   
KYUNG KIM:   Like dang, I guess my putts can go in, since I was lipping it out.  
RHONDA GLENN:   And then one more on No.12, what did you hit?   
KYUNG KIM:   I hit a 9‑iron, and I had a five‑footer.   
RHONDA GLENN:   Was that an easy putt?   
KYUNG KIM:   Straight in.  
   
 Q.   Four in a row.   What were you thinking then?  
KYUNG KIM:   I don't know.   I was just trying to make four birdies, I guess.   
   
 Q.   (Question on having father as a caddie.)  
KYUNG KIM:   Uh‑huh.   He knows my golf game, and he just knows me as a person.   So he knows when I get tensed up, or he just tries to calm me down.  
   
 Q.   What did he say to you?   
KYUNG KIM:   He just told me to breathe, slow down my tempo and hit the ball like I practiced.  
   
 Q.   (Question on mother.)  
KYUNG KIM:   Yeah.   This is the first time that I've seen her really happy.   
It's been a while that he's been on my bag.   He's usually a spectator, so I don't usually get to see him like reaction wise.   He was funny.  
   
 Q.   What was today like in terms of your fatigue?   It's been a long week and pretty draining.   Was there any point during the day where you kind of seemed to feel it a little bit?   Obviously looking at the scorecard it wasn't necessarily‑‑  
KYUNG KIM:   Actually I'm not as tired as I thought I would be.   I'm actually okay.   
   
 Q.   What does it mean to you to have that gold medal, to have your name on the trophy?   
KYUNG KIM:   It means a lot to me.   It's like I finally did it, won a national championship.   It's pretty amazing, my hard work paid off.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday you said (indiscernible).  
KYUNG KIM:   Uh‑huh, I guess I just realized that I can.   I played this week like I did, and in future match play championships, I'll be okay.   
   
 Q.   Was there a point during the round today where you felt, hey, I'm in control here and this could be mine to win?  
KYUNG KIM:   Uh‑huh.   I guess when I got to the second nine‑‑ like the second 18, the back nine, I was just up the whole time, so I just felt like, okay, if I can keep steady and make pars and birdies, then‑‑  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   Yeah, the first couple holes and last few holes.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned you came into this just hoping to get through the round of 32.   That had to take some of the pressure off.   Did you come farther than you expected to?   
KYUNG KIM:   Well, I've been hitting the ball really well and putting not so bad, too.   I guess I'm just reading the greens better and some putts went in.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   I was first alternate this year, but I called last week, and I got in.   
   
 Q.   And now you're a champ this week, what does that mean for next year?  
KYUNG KIM:   I won't have to qualify.   
I like to have my dad, have him close, check if I'm right or wrong.   I think he's a better green reader, which is nice.   When he used to play golf, he used to putt really well, and now when I play putting contests with him, I'll win.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   He just played golf for fun.  
   
 Q.   And where do you go now?   
KYUNG KIM:   I'm going home first and then (indiscernible.)  
   
 Q.   What other events are you going to play this summer?  
KYUNG KIM:   Actually I'm done.   I'm going to Korea with my mom just for vacation, just staying away from golf until I go to college because I know there will be a lot of tournaments ahead of me.  
   
 Q.   And you're playing the Open?   
KYUNG KIM:   So far, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You're not going to play the U.S. Women's Amateur?  
KYUNG KIM:   Not this year.  
   
 Q.   You don't have to qualify.   
KYUNG KIM:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   I come back August 8th.  
   
 Q.   Do you normally do that?  
KYUNG KIM:   No, haven't been to Korea for like eight years.  
   
 Q.   Visit friends and family and see your grandparents?  
KYUNG KIM:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   Are you planning on going four years to school?  
KYUNG KIM:   Uh‑huh, I want to get a degree before I turn pro.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   I'm leaning towards business, accounting, but I'm not sure yet.   
   
 Q.   Why did you want to get your degree versus try to play golf now?  
KYUNG KIM:   I just want to have a backup just in case I don't make it.   
   
 Q.   Your biggest victory (inaudible)?  
KYUNG KIM:   Probably the Heather Farr in '08.   
   
 Q.   It's been a while.   
KYUNG KIM:   It's been a while.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KYUNG KIM:   (Indiscernible.)   We were just making birdies after birdies, and she's such a great putter.   I wish I had her putting.   I think combined we had like 11 or 12 birdies.   
   
 Q.   Have you had a stretch where you've made as many birdies as you appeared to have this week?  
KYUNG KIM:   I haven't for a while, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think it happened this week then?   
KYUNG KIM:   Because I think I wasn't concentrating on my form.   It was more like each hole (inaudible).  
   
 Q.   You and Ashlan had 11 birdies.   
KYUNG KIM:   11 birdies just this morning?   
   
 Q.   And then you had seven together combined this afternoon.   
KYUNG KIM:   Wow.   
RHONDA GLENN:   Thank you.   You've been very nice to come in and visit with us.   Congratulations, and enjoy your trip home.
