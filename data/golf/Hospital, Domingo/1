 Q. So you started off pretty good today on hole 13. Can you tell me a little about that?
 DOMINGO HOSPITAL: On hole 13? It's a birdie? 

 Q. Yes, a birdie. 
 DOMINGO HOSPITAL: Yeah, hit a good 6-iron just right to the pin and then holed the putt. 
 One meter and a half downhill. 

 Q. How do you like the course today?
 DOMINGO HOSPITAL: I felt it was very tough for me. I'm not used to playing on such a hard conditions of the greens and such fast greens. I feel I have to play very defensive every single shot. I don't feel the right way. I would have to get used to this so hard conditions. For us, for Europeans, it's just, it's another way, you know. It's another way. 

 Q. Did you have a favorite club today that you used?
 DOMINGO HOSPITAL: Yeah, I played very good from the tee. Off the tee, very good shots, 3-woods and driver both very good.
