  Q. I know it wasn't the exact finish you were looking for, but how well you played today, kind of characterize the round if you could.
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I played awesome the front nine.  I was 4-under.  I was right there.  And then on the back nine I played pretty well.  I just gave myself a lot of really difficult putts, pretty much downhill every putt, so it was tough.  But yeah, like on 14 I was in the middle of the fairway in a divot and then I got lucky on 15.  That's golf, and that's the way it works.  I'm just happy to finish the way I did.
 Q. From where you started at the restart to where you are now going to the TOUR Championship, how can you characterize how your game has come along as we've come back since the pandemic?
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, it's awesome to get one of those weeks that you play good.  I haven't been playing great the last couple weeks, so this gave me a lot of confidence what is coming next for East Lake.  I just feel great.  I'm happy to be in this situation right now.
 Q. Talk about the confidence you're carrying into East Lake next week.
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I'm in a really good situation.  Just happy to get into East Lake, so now that I'm in that situation, just try to play my best and have a good week.
 Q. Jon shooting a bogey-free 64, can you put into perspective how difficult it was to try and keep pace with him?
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, Jon Rahm was right in front of me, and I saw him, he was playing great, I think he played really well the back nine.  Yeah, I gave myself a chance on 15, on the par-5.  I just didn't make the putt.  I hit a pretty good putt but I just misread it.  And then yeah, gave myself a lot of good chances and just couldn't catch him.
