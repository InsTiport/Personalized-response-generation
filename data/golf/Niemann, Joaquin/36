 Q.  Before we get into the match, what is your reaction?  You played great for two days and then get stuck paired against the NCAA champ.  What is your reaction?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I feel really good with my game.  I play really golf these three days.  I think this day was the best golf I played in the tournament.   
But yeah, it was a really tough match with Braden.  He's a really good guy and also really good player.   
Yeah, it was fun.  We play until 18 and it was a really good match.   
 Q.  He finished top 4, top 5 at the PGA TOUR event.  Did you see him play on TV or at the NCAAs or just had heard about him?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: No, I just heard about him.  I never see him play golf.   
 Q.  What did people tell you about his game?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: He got a really good short game.   
 Q.  Did he?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, we played together three days.  He made so many up and downs and he chip in like three maybe.   
Yeah, he's got really a good short game.   
 Q.  Talk about the match.  It was probably one of the better ones we saw today.  What was working?  Where did you really feel like the momentum shifted in his favor?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I think I was 1-up starting No. 10.  I think No. 10 I hit a really good putter and it went in.  I thought it was in, but didn't go in.   
 Q.  That was for par, right?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah.  I think things there maybe change, because he hit a bad driver and he was maybe lucky and he got a really good lie and make a birdie.   
Then I win the other hole, but it's there he start playing really good golf.  He also hit a really good shot on No. 13 I think between the trees.  Made birdie there.   
I think there was the moment.   
 Q.  Plans after this week?  What's coming up next?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Going back to Chile and going to play Q- School for the web.com October 31st, I think.   
 Q.  That's second stage, right?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, second stage.   
 Q.  So if you don't get through web.com, are you still committed to USF?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I'm committed, but we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  There was a test you had to take, right?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did that not go very well?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I didn't do so well.  I don't know if I'm going to make it again because I just want to play golf.   
 Q.  Yeah.  So you would have to retake that test, like the Telfer (ph) or whatever?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah.   
 Q.  You would have to take it again before you would be able to play?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I think so.   
 Q.  What do they do for the test?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: How is the test?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I got to talk with a computer and make an essay.  It's hard for me that I don't speak good English.   
 Q.  Just going back to the match, sitting there on 18 green and you got a chance to take it to extra holes and he makes the putt, what are you thinking when you see the putt go in?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, on 18, he got to make 3-putter there, because then I made the putter.   
On 18 I know that I have to make birdie, and I hit a really good second shot but it was a little bit short.   
Then I have to -- I know that I have to chip it in and I was a little bit long, but my other putter was already good putter.   
It's all right.  Happens.   
 Q.  Were you like in shock a little bit that he made that?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: No.  I mean, I think already match was done there, because he got to make 3-putter and it was hard to make 3-putter from there, so it was already over.   
 Q.  So you think your game is ready for that next level, that pro level?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I think so.
