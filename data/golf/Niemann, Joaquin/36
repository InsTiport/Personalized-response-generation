Q. Was it 2-under?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: 2-Under, yeah.
Q. What did you think?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I played really good golf.  The golf course of really hard in the afternoon.  It was windy.  The greens were getting really hard.
Yeah, the first nine were really tough because there is no par-5.  Went 1-over there and make birdie on the Par 5 and birdie at 16, the par-3.
I play really good golf so happy with my golf.  See what happens tomorrow.
Q. What did you think about Bel-Air when you played the practice round?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I like the course.  I think it's more like strategy on this course.  You got to see where the pin is going to be and try to hit putters uphill.  If you are downhill you're almost dead.
Yeah, so I think strategy is going to be good for Bel-Air.
Q. When do you think about the pairing that you're in with the top three guys in the world ranking?  Did you like that?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I loved that.  It was a really nice pairing.  I met Braden last week in the western; haven't meet Maverick.  They are really nice guys.  Enjoy to play with them 18 holes today, and hope to enjoy more tomorrow.  Some good guys.
