 Q.  Joaquin, were you pleased where your round? I know there was some frustration towards the end and some putts that didn't go, but a closing birdies makes it better, doesn't it?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, that last birdie on that hole make it a lot better. Yeah, I mean, I played good. Hit the ball good. I made some good putters at the beginning of the round on my 1st hole, and then, yeah, I couldn't drop a couple of them.   
Still happy for a good round and good position.   
 Q.  You have the celebration from winning that I'm sure lasted a few days. How did you prepare mentally and say, Okay, these over with and I have to play golf now?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I got try to take that off and just feel that I didn't win. Just try to focus again and start another week. It's a new week, a new tournament, just a new course. Just do the same stuff I did last week and hopefully have a great week, too.   
 Q.  What do think about this golf course?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I like it. It's in good shape. It's bermuda. I like bermuda. I live in Florida so I'm used to it. Yeah, greens are really, really quick so you got to be a little careful with some putts.   
Yeah, like it. It's nice.
