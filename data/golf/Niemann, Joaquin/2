Q. 63, capped off by an eagle.  How big was that not just for the lead but to give you momentum heading into tomorrow?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   It was huge.  I wasn't really satisfied on my first 16 holes.  I thought I was playing great.  I thought I could put myself in a better position, and then finishing that way and making eagle on 18 made me really happy and gave me a bit of motivation for tomorrow.
Q. How comfortable do you think you'll be trying to win this tournament again knowing just last week you were in the throes of winning the Sentry Tournament of Champions?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I took a lot of experience from last week.  I'm just going to try to putt everything I took from last week into this week and hopefully try to win it.
Q. Nice way to finish the round.  Talk about the eagle on 18.
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I hit two perfect 7-woods from the tee.  It fits really well for two 7-woods and for that pin, especially that it was a little bit tough to get it in there.  I hit a perfect shot and then I gave myself a pretty easy putt.  It was pretty straight and I hit a great putt and I made three.
Q. How much confidence are you riding coming off last week going into the final round in contention again?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, a lot.  I think after last week I'm just going to keep putting myself in a good position and hopefully tomorrow have a good round.
Q. What a difference a couple holes make.  That finish changes everything for you, doesn't it?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, it's great to have some boost for tomorrow.  It's a great finish, great way to put myself in position for Sunday.
Q. Second time you've eagled the 18th hole.  The 9th hole, unlucky break?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, No. 9, I've been hitting such huge drivers every day.  It hurt to have wedge in my hand and make 5.  But yeah, 18 is perfect for two 7-woods.  I really like my 7-wood and you have a perfect flight for that pin, left.
Q. Overall you have a chance to win this week again on the PGA TOUR after a great performance last week in Maui.  How well are you playing in your estimation?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   I think I'm playing great.  Just need to keep doing the same stuff I've been doing these two weeks and hopefully get a good round tomorrow, and you never know.
