Q. So what's your first experience on the International Team been like so far?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I saw this on video, I was waiting for years on this. Just to be here with the team, everyone, the crowd is awesome, and yeah just being here in Australia on this beautiful course is amazing.
Q. Has there been one experience that's stood out more than any others?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, just hanging out with everyone. We are trying to be together all the time during the day, and go out to dinner together. It's a lot more fun than a normal week on Tour.
Q. What's it like playing for an icon like Ernie Els?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: He's my favorite. Our captain, he knows a lot about the game and this course. We are getting a lot of information from him, and yeah, played with him a couple of times and I really enjoy playing for him.
Q. First impressions of Royal Melbourne and what you think it takes to be successful around here?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: It's a really, really tough course. Starting from the tee, you have to put the ball in play. You're going to hit a lot of draws, fades, high, low, so you're going to hit a lot of different kind of shots. I think that makes the best golf course.
Q. When is the last time you played in a team competition?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: We used to play a lot of like team events in South America for Chile. There's nothing like this.
