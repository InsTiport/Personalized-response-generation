Q. So close, I can tell you're frustrated.  So close again, what are you feeling right now?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, overall I'm just happy the way I played the last two holes.  I hit so many good putts on the last couple holes on the back nine that I thought were going to drop.  Just another good week, so happy with that.
Q. Talking about 17, the decision to chip and not putt from there.  It was a great decision obviously; it went in.  Talk about your mindset there?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, it was just a tough green.  I know that the putter would be more like the safe play.  I could release and make three from there.  But if there was no chance that I can make it -- could make it and make a two on that one with the putter, so I just decided to chip it.  I had a preferred lie, so I gave myself a really good lie.
Q. Overall you have to take a lot of confidence off the Hawaiian islands, don't you?
JOAQUÍN NIEMANN:   Yeah, it was a great two weeks in Hawai'i.  Going to go with all the positive and really happy with all the work we've done and just proud.
