Q. Happy with where you stand now going into match play?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I'm really happy today.  I played really good golf.  The first hole wasn't so good, but then I bring it back and enjoy the day.
Q. Tell me about the eagle at 1.
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, so I was --  I made double No. 14 after bogey on 13, so was 3-over and was like, Oy, I got to make a couple birdies.  (Laughter.)
I birdied the next win after the par-5 and make a lot of birdies since there.  Eagle No. 1.  So that was a really good moment on the round.
Q. What did you hit into No. 1?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: No. 1 I hit driver to the middle and then I hit a 9-iron to like four, five feet maybe.
Yeah, made the putter.
Q. Is there a sense of relief for you that you're now into match play?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah.  I mean, I like playing golf, so I don't feel like -- I mean, if I play good golf there are many, many days to play, so let's see if I can do it until Sunday.
Try to enjoy as much as I can for these days.
Q. You've been in match play at USGA events before.
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yes.
Q. For you, what's the difference between stroke play and match play?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, stroke play is like you have to concentrate more like in your game just shot by shot.
And match play is also the same, but you got to like have a strategy and depends of how the other one is doing.
So some things could change.  Maybe they're going to be -- it's going to be fun.
Q. How does your game set up with Riviera?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I think I feel better in Riviera than this course.  Yeah, I feel good.  Just need to make a couple putters and I think I'm going to be all right.
