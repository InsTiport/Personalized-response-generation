Q. You shot 5-under today, doing everything that you can, because you are a bubble boy.  Just take us through what's going through your mind out there?  A lot of pressure playing today?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I wasn't hitting the ball great this week.  I think the only good thing about Sunday was my putter.  My putter was really good.  I was struggling on the greens during the week, and then I talk with my coach a little bit and let him know what was going on.
Yeah, it works really good this morning.
Q. What do you do now?  Are you going to anxiously wait around and see what happens or just go on with your day?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: I'm going to be all right.  I tried to do my best.  So if I make it, I will be happy to play next week, and if not, I can just go back to Chile for a couple weeks off, so it's also great.
Q. Do you have your fall schedule lined up yet?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: No, I'm not sure yet.  But hopefully I play everything.
