  Q. Tough break with that lie.  How difficult was that lie that you had there for the third shot?
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I had a perfect line the second shot, I just mis-hit it a little bit.  I got a little lucky that it carried the hazard and then it was not an easy lie and then, I mean, it is what it is, but, yeah, pretty happy.
 Q. I'm glad to see you smile because you played a fantastic round of golf today.  I know you're disappointed losing the playoff, but what do you take from what you did today?
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   I mean, if you asked me at the beginning of the round I'm going to be in a playoff, I would probably take it, but, yeah, the way I was playing the whole week and the way I played today, and then I just look back and I see those two par-5s I made par.  But, yeah, I mean it is what it is.
 Q. You put on a good show.  I feel we're going to see you back here in Maui in the future.
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah.  Thank you.
 Q. How tough was that lie over there on the first playoff hole?
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, it was not an easy lie.  I played it like a bunker shot.  Yeah, once I hit it, I was under the gun and just, it was a lot of grass behind and very thick.  I gave myself a chance, but I just didn't do it.
 Q. Assess the whole day.  You played so well and so beautifully to shoot that 64 in regulation.
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, I played awesome the whole week, especially today.  One of my best rounds.  Yeah, I just look back to 15 and 18 from today, I couldn't make birdie and I think it was right there.  But, yeah, just happy and it was close.
 Q. I'm guessing far more positives to take than negatives from this today.
 JOAQUIN NIEMANN:   Yeah, of course.  You got to stay positive.  I'm playing great.  Yeah, if you asked me at the beginning of the day that I was going to be in a playoff, I would take it.  But, yeah, it's -- it was a pretty good week.
