 Q.  Considering the conditions, how good is the round you played out there today?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, it was tough. It was a lot of wind, rain. Had to put my jacket, take it off all day. I brought my umbrella, so yeah, I just did a pretty good job after everything that happened. I finished with a couple birdies, which was good. So yeah, I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  Considering this is your first time here, how happy are you with how you've learned this golf course and being able to put yourself in contention your first time here?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, my first time here, and I have really enjoyed everything here. It's a nice place to be. Yeah, and then the course is pretty good. The greens are tough, so you've got to be really good around the greens. So yeah, hopefully I can keep it rolling for the weekend.
