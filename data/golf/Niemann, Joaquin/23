Q. Just nice playing. Good to get the season off to a good start. You've had a lot of good rounds here. What do you like about this course the most?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I have some good memories on this tournament. Last year I got my card here, so it's really nice to be back here again and also having a good round.
Q. Last season was pretty solid, particularly towards the end for you. Do you have any different goals or things in mind for this season? Obviously winning is a big thing.
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: At the beginning of the last season I start a little bit -- I don't know, like was kind of different. Then I start playing really good at the end. Now I feel kind of the same.
Hopefully try to win one tournament. I mean, I don't know. I got the game, so I just got to be patient for it and just wait.
Q. Do you feel like the Presidents Cup is still in the back of your mind and you feel like this fall if you make an impression you might get Captain Els' attention?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I got to play really good golf because it's a lot of good players really close together for spots, so it's going to be really close. Hopefully try to have good tournaments, and if I can win one, it's going to be a lot easier.
Q. Do you feel like this is a new season or a continuation? You guys don't get that much time off.
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, was a pretty short break; just three weeks off for me. Can't wait to be back here; I really enjoy playing golf. Just being here I like it; it's like vacations.
Q. It's only one round. Can one round set up a season just to have a nice start as opposed to not?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, makes a big different to have the first round of the season being good. Gives you a lot of confidence for what is coming next. Hopefully have three more rounds like this.
