 Q.  Joaquin, obviously, the bogey on 17 hurt, but the way you played down the stretch, you've got to be very proud of yourself how you played coming down the stretch here today.  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I feel really good. I knew that I needed to go really low today. Everybody was playing so good, and the course was very accessible to make some birdies.   
Yeah, I played so good the last couple of holes. That ball on 17, I just hit a bad putt from the tee. Then that putt was a tricky putt. It was left to right, and the green was right to left. So I didn't trust much. Just happy with the way I played, and I'm really excited for the next couple of weeks on TOUR.   
 Q.  This has got to give you a ton of confidence going forward into the next few weeks that you can get yourself into contention, and you can probably pull it off down the stretch, can't you?  
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, it's awesome to get those nerves again. I miss them. It was probably like two, three months without playing any golf. So, yeah, it's good to be back here, back in contention, and I just tell myself that I'm good enough, that I can play with the best guys, and just more confidence and confidence every time.
