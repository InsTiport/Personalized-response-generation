Q. Congratulations on a huge half-point. Have you ever been involved in anything with a scene like this before, the crowd, everything that went with it?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yeah, I think there is nothing like this. It was unbelievable. It was a grind out there. We fight until the last hole and we got the half-point. That's big.
Q. This is massive. You know how important it was yesterday, the momentum went out from the Internationals, and today, the last couple groups bring it home for you?
BYEONGHUN AN: That was a big half point. To be fair, we were struggling a little bit on the front nine. We were not hitting it great. We were not in the places where we wanted to be, but you know, at the end we got a half-point, but I mean, I guess I'm a little disappointed I missed the putt, but still, we're in a great position going into Sunday.
You know, we played great today I think. We missed some crucial putts coming down, and the half-point was big. 10 is where we want to be for sure.
Q. How much are you looking forward to getting out tomorrow?
JOAQUIN NIEMANN: Yes, I can't wait for tomorrow. It's going to be the last day of the week and it's going to be big for the team and let's try to make history.
