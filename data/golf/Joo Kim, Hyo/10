Q. What was the difference between your front nine and back nine in your 10-under round today?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I had a bit of a rocky start today, so from holes 1 to 5 I missed a couple of putts.
As I made the turn, birdies on No. 10 and 11 were probably the most important ones for the round.  After making those, I just felt like I had more confidence to continue with that streak.
Q. That streak resulted in a 7-under effort on the back nine.  How does this 62 compare to your 61 at the Evian Championship?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I'm not really sure what the difference is.  I still shot 10-under here today and also at the Evian Championship, but at Evian it had been a long time since I played well, so I felt really good about that round.
I feel great about today's round not making any bogeys, and overall I thought it was a great round.
Q. What kind of confidence does this great round give you heading into the major next week?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  Playing well today in my last round I felt like I had a really great rhythm, and I want to continue that going into next week's major, ANA Inspiration.
If I can play well like I did today, that's going to give me a lot of confidence.  That's the hope and the expectation.
