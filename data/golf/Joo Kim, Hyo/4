(Through translation.)
Q. How was your round?
HYO JOO KIM: It was raining all day, and I think that affected my play today; made it more tiring. I think it had something to do with my back, which was starting to hurt, too.
It was a really difficult round. My putting wasnât really working, but I tried to do my best. There were a lot of things that didnât work out today, so thatâs disappointing.
Q. After leading the round you found some trouble on No. 14.
HYO JOO KIM: On the teeing ground I heard a loud noise and thought maybe I should have backed off or switched my target.
Q. Next week is the British Open.  How would you like to...
HYO JOO KIM: There were a lot of chances that came up today and I think I learned a lot from today.  Probably. Although I wished it turned out a little better for me today, I hope I continue to play well next week.
