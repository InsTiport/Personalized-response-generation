Q. What was the key to your round today?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.) The putting was good today. I had a little bit of trouble, but with my good approach I made a score today.
Q. How did the golf course play today?
HYO JOO KIM: Crazy long. (Through translation.) Some of the holes played very long so some of them are just very difficult.
But the green was soft, so I was able to stop the ball on the green.
Q. Very consistent season?
HYO JOO KIM: Compared to last year I'm having better shots, so that's influenced the putting, too, so I'm making the score.
Q. What do you think about playing in Japan?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.) I like playing in Japan. All the conditions are good. Food is good here, so I'm enjoying playing here.
Q. We heard you wanted to play in the future in Japan.
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.) I definitely like to play here in Japan, too.
Q. If you win this tournament, what do you think?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.) We'll see if I win what happens.
