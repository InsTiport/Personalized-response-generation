Q. Bogey-free 7-under to move to 9-under for the tournament.  What kept you so consistent today?
HYO JOO KIM: Overall I'm really happy with my score.  I honestly did not know how low I shot until I was finished.  I didn't know I went bogey-free until after, after the round.
There were a lot of situations where I could have bogeyed, but I kept thinking to do my best.  It helped that what my putter was working really well.
Overall really happy about my score.
Q. That putter worked really well, including the weather delay.  You were on the 14th green when that happened.  What did you have to adjust to after the weather delay with the final four holes?
HYO JOO KIM: On that hole I was in the bunker so it really forced me to stay focused.
I really thought about how to get myself a par save.  The wind pick up a lot after we came back out to play.  I really thought about how I want to get my shot on the green.
It all worked out.
Q. That focus led to you play the final four holes at 3-under par, including an eagle at 18.  What are you hoping to take away from your play over the first 36 holes heading into the weekend?
HYO JOO KIM: Overall the past few days I really just tried to the my best.  We don't know if the weather is going to be good or bad.  We just don't know about that.
I just want to stay focused on my goal.  Just keep on the greens.  Hope that my putting stroke keeps doing well there.  Just keep focusing on my goals.
