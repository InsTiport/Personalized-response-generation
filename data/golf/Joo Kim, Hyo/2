Q. Tell us your round today?
HYO JOO KIM: I started good but made some mistake on hole No. 5 with double bogey. But glad to come back at the end. I regret about that.
Q. Coming back from that double bogey?
HYO JOO KIM: I was kind of mad at that moment. But I tried to control my mind, said to myself calm down
I really concentrated on back 9.
Q. You made some good birdie on No.17 and No.18 coming in?
HYO JOO KIM: After that double bogey, I kept shooting pars, I really wanted to make birdies and concentrate. It was really good finish at the end, and I am happy that I am not far away from the top.
Q. Final round tomorrow?
HYO JOO KIM: Not to make a mistake like today. I know its going to be very nervous day, but I just have to wait for the chances. And I hope the chance will come earlier tomorrow.
