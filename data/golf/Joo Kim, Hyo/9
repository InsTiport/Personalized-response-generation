Q. Fantastic playing; 3-under round.  What was working for you today?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  Yesterday just my shots weren't coming together, so I practiced a lot before I went home.  I was able to gather some of those things when I went home.
I just feel like everything really came together today and it connected really well, even though there were a couple mistakes out there.  A lot of chances opened up.  Birdies came together.  My chipping was great today.  That's how I was able to get a low score.
Q. Shot a tie for the Kia Classic record; 62 at the end the Kia Classic last week.  What did you take away from your play there to the ANA Inspiration this week?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I played really well in the last round at Kia Classic last week.  That really elevated my confidence level.  I really wanted to be able to take that level into this week of a major.  Just wanted to be able to maintain that throughout the whole week.
Q. You finished in the top 10 three tournaments in a row.  What's been the most important part of your game to keep this high level of play for you?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  Over those three weeks I had a lot of great results.  I think those low scores are because of my confidence level.  So because of those good results and the confidence that comes with that, I think everything just kind of goes together really well.
When I do make mistakes and they come up, that confidence has taken me through and helped me get through that.
