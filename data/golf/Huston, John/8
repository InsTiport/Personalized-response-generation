 Q. Great round today, great position heading into round 2, and obviously a long day yesterday and this morning. Just a couple keys to the round. 
 JOHN HUSTON: Actually I didn't hit the ball that great. I made some good putts and chipped in once this morning, so I got a lot out of the round. You know, the greens are soft and not that fast, so you can take a little bit of a run at it. 
 I'm happy with the score, but I really need to play better, hit the ball better, to keep it up.

 Q. How about the condition of the course? What did that do as far as positive or negative?
 JOHN HUSTON: Well, I think it definitely made it easier. It's really soft. It's playing a little bit long, but I think the softness counterbalances that.

 Q. How much did you get through yesterday?
 JOHN HUSTON: We got to 11 tee. 

 Q. What did you get through last night as opposed to this morning?
 JOHN HUSTON: Well, we had eight holes to go this morning, so we played 11 yesterday and eight this morning.

 Q. Was there a big difference in the course between last night and today?
 JOHN HUSTON: You know, it just didn't have as many puddles this morning, but it was still really soft.
