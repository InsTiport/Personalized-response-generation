Q.  It's got to be a great way to start a weekend here in the Quad Cities.
JOHN HUSTON:  Yeah, I shot a good score.  I didn't play that great, but my short game was good and I was able to go away with no bogeys, so that's always good.
Q.  No bogeys, that's got to set you up nicely for tomorrow.  What are you concerned about as you get ready for the second round?
JOHN HUSTON:  I've got to play a little bit sharper, not hit some of the wayward shots that I hit today, and hopefully make a few more putts.
Q.  With the hot weather it seems like getting off to a good start when    you've been here in the past when it's been even hotter.  When it gets like this, it seems even more important to get off with low scores in the early rounds?
JOHN HUSTON:  Yeah, with as hot as it is, I'm sure they'll have to keep the greens fairly wet so they don't bake out, but definitely the scores are going to be good all week, as long as the wind doesn't blow, I would say 5 , 6 under a day, probably 20 , 22 under.
Q.  Is it more important to go no bogeys if that's what your goal is?
JOHN HUSTON:  I mean, that's a nice feeling.  That's not always a sign that you played better than a round where you have eight birdies and two or three bogeys, but I'm always happy to come away with no bogeys.
