  Q. Can you talk about today?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Played pretty much the same as the first few days. Hit the ball good in spots, not so good in spots. But overall I'm pretty happy.  
  
  Q. What about the tournament overall?   
 JOHN HUSTON: It was great. I think the scores are really good because the greens are soft. There is not really much you can do about that when the rain comes.   
 But overall, I thought it was a great tournament.  
  
  Q. The winds kind of picked up today. Did that factor in at all?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Late in the day. I think it will be a factor on 18 because it's hard to keep it up on that shelf. So it will be interesting to see what happens.  
  
  Q. Any other final thoughts?   
 JOHN HUSTON: No, just turned out great. I think it's a great place to come to and probably be a great place to come back to.
