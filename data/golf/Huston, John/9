  Q. You estimated you were 18th on the alternate list. Brad Faxon dropped out because of his knee, you got in. Three birdies today on your first nine, two birdies on your final nine, a 5-under par 65. That's taking advantage of the opportunity you're given, right?  
 JOHN HUSTON: Yeah, I was just happy to get in the field, and then it was such a beautiful day. I played pretty good, hit a lot of greens and not really all that close that often, but I made the few good chances that I had.   
  
  Q. What about your game was really on today? What was working that enabled you to shoot this 65?  
 JOHN HUSTON: Well, I drove it really well, and I think that sets up the whole golf course. You know, it's a little easier shots into the green, and I hit a lot of greens, maybe only missed one or two greens, and I putted good. I could have made a few others, but I'm happy with the way I putted.   
  
  Q. I know it's only the first round, but do you have a sense that you want to stay aggressive in this tournament and really take advantage of this opportunity you have?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Yeah, if the weather stays like it was today, you're going to have to just keep going lower and lower. But you know, I'm happy with the way my game is right now, and looking forward to the opportunity.
