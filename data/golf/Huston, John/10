  Q.  John, a quiet 66 today.  I mean, nothing really spectacular, you but you kept plugging along and made a couple nice birdies coming in.   
 JOHN HUSTON:  Yeah.  I played okay.  I didn't play great.  I would imagine by the end of the day there will be some really low scores.  So not too excited about it, but happy to have a good score.  I haven't been playing very well.   
  
  Q.  Tell me about how you like this Bermuda grass so much.  You seem to play well on Bermuda grass.   
 JOHN HUSTON:  Well, especially here it's running so fast.  I've never really seen some of these holes play so short.  Not Bermuda on the greens, but the greens are beautiful and really fast.  That's probably the only defense today.   
  
  Q.  Tell me what about what it is that clicked with your game out there today that made you play so well?   
 JOHN HUSTON:  Just, you know, I kept it in play pretty good.  The few bad shots I hit I got up and down for par.  So I'm not making any bogeys and I took advantage of the Par 5s for the most part.   
  
  Q.  6-under.  Well done so far.  Keep having a good week.   
 JOHN HUSTON: Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.
