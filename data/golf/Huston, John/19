Q.
Talk about your match, maybe a turning point. 

JOHN HUSTON:  I made a whole lot of pars.  I think I parred every hole on the front.  I was 1 up and then I made a birdie on 11 to go 2 up and then stayed that well until I three-putted 17.  I had an easy little putt to finish the match.  You hate to give anybody a second life, especially a player like Peter.  Other than that, I was happy with the way I was playing.


Q.  Who are you playing next?

JOHN HUSTON:  I think it's Ian Poulter.


Q.  Yeah, you are.  Ian Poulter beat somebody pretty easily, like 7-5, so he finished a while back.  Talk about Ian.  Do you know anything about him?

JOHN HUSTON:  No.


Q.  You've never played him?

JOHN HUSTON:  No.
