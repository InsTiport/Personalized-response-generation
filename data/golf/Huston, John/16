JOHN HUSTON:  I played pretty well.  I hit pretty much all the fairways.

You know, I just did not make the putts I needed to make on the last few holes, and I had a couple of three-putts on the front nine.  The greens were good but they're tricky.  They're hard to read.
Q.  Can you believe your fourth round is finally over?
JOHN HUSTON:  No, it's been a long week.  I was having some toe problems earlier in the week and didn't play in the Pro-Am, so I'm pretty happy to finish with the score that I shot.
Q.  You've been playing a while.  Is this one of the craziest kind of weekend scenarios that you've seen in a while?
JOHN HUSTON:  Yeah, it happens at least once or twice a year.  I think we're all pretty much used to it.
Q.  It sounds kind of corny, but -- (inaudible)?
JOHN HUSTON:  Well, I was hoping.  I had one really good chance about ten years ago, but I lost in a playoff, so I was hoping maybe this would be a little makeup, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.
Q.  You said you left some out there.  It must kind of make you feel a little disappointed, but it still looks like you're in the top three.
JOHN HUSTON:  Yeah, this week probably everybody will have left a few out there on the greens.

But like I said, I'm pretty happy with the way I played.  I wasn't playing that well coming in and wasn't feeling that great, so to be in this position, I was pretty pleased.
