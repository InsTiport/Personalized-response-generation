  Q. Can I get some overall thoughts about your 2-under par round?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Well, it's been a little bit up-and-down. I haven't really putted that great, but I've been able to make enough to where I'm still in decent position.  
  
  Q. What were some of the highlights of your round birdie-wise. Can you go through them?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Yeah, I got off to a poor start bogeying the first hole, and then I was able to bounce back on 2 and 4.  
 But overall I was just kind of hanging in there at the end when it was getting dark.  
  
  Q. How is the course different today than it was yesterday for you?   
 JOHN HUSTON: I think it was pretty similar. There might have been a little more moisture in the fairways, especially, but the greens were still pretty soft.  
  
  Q. Similar question but more about the course set-up. How was the course set up differently today than it was yesterday?   
 JOHN HUSTON: There were a couple of tees that were back that were up yesterday. But I think it was balanced out to where some of the other holes were pretty much the same though.  
  
  Q. What are your thoughts heading into the weekend?   
 JOHN HUSTON: Just do the best I can, hopefully hit a few more fairways and give myself some chances.
