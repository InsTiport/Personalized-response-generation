 Q. Just start with an overall thought about your round today. 
 JOHN HUSTON: Well, I got off to a good start and then I played kind of not very good in the middle and then was able to hang in there and finished decent.

 Q. What adjustments did you make in the middle?
 JOHN HUSTON: Nothing really, I just started hitting the greens again. I started hitting some bad drives and missing the greens and then was able to straighten it out at the end. 

 Q. What adjustments have you made and what adjustments will you make --
 JOHN HUSTON: Nothing, just keep doing the same thing. I think everybody that is playing well is probably driving it in the fairway, so just got to keep hitting it in the fairway and keep hitting greens and giving yourself good chances.
