Q. Talk us through the hole, No. 2.MIKE KEYMONT: I made a dumb bogey on 1.  Went to No. 2, and I think I had 157.  Pin was up front.  Hit a nice, easy 8 iron and got it over the bunker, and I just saw it get closer and closer. I was hoping to stay on the green, to be honest with you.  Everything's been running off the green, and it went in.Q. Got to be a special moment, something you'll always remember?MIKE KEYMONT: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, not a whole lot of good things happened the last two days, trust me.  It was pretty painful for two days.Q. What was the club?MIKE KEYMONT: 8 iron.
