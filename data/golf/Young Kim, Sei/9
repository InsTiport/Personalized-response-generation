  Q. Tell us a little bit about your round today.
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Overall I'll be honest, it was a frustrating day, both front nine and back nine.
 But I finished on a positive note on the back nine.  I felt like my shots were coming back, so feel pretty good going into tomorrow.
 Q. How were the course conditions out there versus the first two rounds?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Talking about the course, it was very difficult.  It was pretty cold throughout the day, so the entire course felt pretty long to me.
 If I can remember correctly, I don't think I've holed it -- the second shot iron under -- anything was under 7-iron, so pretty long overall day.
 Throughout my career I think this course going into the Top 5 toughest out of the USGA tournaments.
 Q. Lastly, we have a couple amateurs on the first page of the leaderboard.  Do you think an amateur can win tomorrow?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, you never know what's going to happen.  Not sure about that question.
