 Q.  A 61, after Sarah Shmelzel tied the record a few minutes ago at 62. When did you realize today you could go really low?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Actually after turn ninth hole, I shoot 5-under, okay, I'm going to keep it going. I wish I could, I want to shoot lowest, because yesterday I wasn't play good. So I wanted to bounce back today, so I tried to keep going, focus whatever happened. I just keep focus on what I have to do. Yeah, I'm very happy 11-under. It's my lowest score ever in my golf life. So I'm very honored.   
 Q.  Your caddie, Paul, mentioned you were trying to keep it simple out there. How did you try and keep it simpler today versus yesterday?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Because I got too many numbers. I need a number, a lot of number, but I realize it not help my golf. So I told him, like Paul, just give me one number. I'm just going to hit the pin. That's the only one way. So we did a great job today.   
 Q.  This is the third tournament scoring record that you hold on the LPGA, two 61s and a 62. What is it about your game that let's you go so low?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just what happens, I just let it go, and each one of the low score -- yeah, when I realize, oh, I'm going to have a really low score, sometimes it's not help me focus. Even good play, I try to keep pushing myself.   
 Q.  Were you aware of the course record heading into 18? I saw that big fist pump when you made the final birdie?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I knew that it was going to, something happen. I just try, okay, same as first hole, playing same as the first hole, so that mind-set helped me out, and I didn't get any extra pressures.
