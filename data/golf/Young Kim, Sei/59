 Q.  So you had a really good round today with the exception of one hole.  But how do you feel like coming off?  You looked like you played pretty well today?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, today pretty good, because I have still jet lag.  So beginning when I hit the first tee shot I felt a little bit of sleepy, but after a couple holes I said wake up.  Yeah, after that, I feel great.  I hit the shot great, except hole 15.   
 Q.  What happened there?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, hitting a good shot and hitting it good.  I had to four-putt that hole, and after that I realized what the problem is for me.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  So when did you arrive here?  Did you come here straight from Korea?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.  I got here on Monday night.   
 Q.  Okay.  Oh, wow, so you're only a few days off.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, it is.   
 Q.  So you have played in Canada very well.  I think this is your third time here and you've finished second and third.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.   
 Q.  What is it about Canada?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I love to come to Canada because the courses are nice.  This golf course is also nice, and the people are very nice, yeah, and warm.  I'm always excited to visit Canada.
