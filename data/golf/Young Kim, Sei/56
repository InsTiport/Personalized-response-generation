Q. Sei Young, 3-under round.  You got it done and you got it all in.  How do you feel walking off the golf course?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, really tough day today because we got a lot of rain, and a couple holes, really gusting wind.  It was tough to judge distance and how to take the club.  Me and my caddie were talking about the right way, and yeah, we did a great job.
Q. No matter what, with the conditions you had out here, I would think you've got to feel pretty good walking off the golf course where you are right now.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Because today, shot condition (selection), really good.  My caddie, I pulled what he said.  I just trust his advice, great.
Q. I know you maybe didn't close the way you wanted to but your back nine otherwise was really good, with four birdies there.  What moment stood out to you or what got into you there as you were playing through those holes?
SEI YOUNG KIM: After the first nine holes, the front nine holes, I was getting used to the weather.  It's easier than the front nine, and that's the reason why I played better than the front nine.
Q. I saw you enjoying some Din Tai Fung last night.  What was the best part of the dinner?  What was your favorite dumpling?  I know mine was the pork.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Really favorite dumpling is truffle dumpling.  It was really awesome, yeah.  When you guys get here, you should be -- should be.
