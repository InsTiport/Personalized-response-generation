 Q.  Your thoughts on the day?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I played conservatively today.  Not very aggressive play today.  I had a couple birdie chance today, a little less than yesterday.  It was good.   
 Q.  Looking back at yesterday, you were going great and then you obviously had a two-stroke penalty going into the final hole.  How did that affect you coming into today?  Did you feel affected by it?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: After I got a penalty, I tried to forget about it.  But it was tough because I didn't know that.  I thought I can move -- that to move the leaf is okay but it wasn't.  But I tried to forget about it and then reset and restarting again today.  Play was good.   
 Q.  Looking at tomorrow, is your goal to win the tournament, and if so, what score do you feel you need to shoot in order to stand a chance?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Have to make a lot of birdies.  Because this course, the par 5s, I have an advantage hitting in two shots.  But other players, do, too.  So maybe a lot of players make a lot of birdies tomorrow.  Yeah, I just try to make every hole, birdie.
