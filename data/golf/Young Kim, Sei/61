 Q.  Level par round, in these conditions, is an excellent round.  What are your thoughts?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, today, when we got here, early morning, it was really cold temperature.  So I'm wearing three or four jackets.  Yeah, it was still cold.  But yeah, it was a tough day and a strong wind on the course.  But I played -- I was going to a really good score the front nine.  I was 6-under.   
But I missed hole 12.  I had a 7 on the par five, so I got a little disappointed.  But after that, much better, bounced back.   
 Q.  The front nine, which was your back nine today, it's a much harder nine, isn't it, than the other nine.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, a little more, but more than the front nine, but the wind is still really strong.  So it was tough to judge distance.  Trying to get the right distance, that was a tough part of today.   
 Q.  That was a really important birdie for you at the last to take you at level for the day.  You're in a really good position heading into the weekend.  What expectations do you have on yourself now?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Depends on the wind really on who is going to win this week.  I think I just keep patience with what happens.  I just play what I have -- I just focus on what I have to do.  Yeah, we'll see.
