Q. Still so many positives.  Through three rounds what are you most pleased with so far?
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I think I feel I got good feeling, because I wasn't good shot striking ball the last week, but I try to figure out.  I got something in there, yeah, I was able to play, yeah, very solid this week.
Q. You hit just about every fairway.  There were a couple missed cues there at 9 and 17.  What will you try to do to correct those?
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I was worry about left side, so at the impact moment I little pushed it and that's why my ball go almost -- the hole 17 almost got to the hazard, but it safe.  Luckily.  Yeah, lucky, was lucky.
But yesterday was in the hazard hole 9, so I just try to make just bogey.  I think bogey is a good score, yeah, after in the hazard.
Q. You're a major champion; defending champion this week.  Anybody who watches you knows how aggressively you like to play.  How important will it be for you to maintain that aggressiveness tomorrow?
SEI YOUNG KIM:   Well, my position is really good chance to the chase the everything.  So, yeah, I don't have any the defend champion, so it's really -- if I play well tomorrow, yeah, good chance to everything.  So yeah, I just keep doing.
Q. Just quickly, are you smiling because you're in the lead or because you're in Naples in the warm weather?  What's better?
