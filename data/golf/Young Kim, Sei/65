 Q.  You had to go low again one more day.  Talk about the game plan today.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was a great day because my shots were solid, and I wasn't any mistakes today.  Every shot hitting fairway, every shot on the green, especially at the par-5, I reached in two.  Yeah, I had one eagle.  Yeah, eagle was great.   
 Q.  Walk us through that eagle that you had on 13.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, 13, hit a driver and then 190 to the pin, so I hit a 5-wood, and then two yards, four yards to the hole and just a left to right a little bit, yeah.   
 Q.  Seemed like this course suited your eye all week.  What did you like best about it?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Greens are softer, so easy to attack the pins.  I gave myself a lot of birdie opportunities.  I think that was the best part of this course.   
 Q.  Talk about next week and the momentum you have going into next week.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I have good momentum this week because -- also last week I played good, and this week played good.  I'm very looking forward to next week, yeah, so exciting.  I can't wait for next week.   
 Q.  Anything on your game you're working on now?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: A little bit of struggle with my putter.  I missed a lot of putts during this week.  So yeah, I just work -- I talked with my caddie a lot, how to improve the putting.  Yeah, it did.   
 Q.  What will you do now while you wait and see what happens here?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I'll wait and see.  We'll see what happens, yeah.  Who knows.   
 Q.  Grab a bite to eat or something?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Maybe no.  Food no good for the playoff.  Just wait.
