 Q.  Have you come back down to earth after that brilliant round of golf?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I shoot 10-under today.  I'm very happy to get back a great shot today.  Yeah, it is awesome.   
 Q.  It was amazing.  You were out in 29, starting on 10.  Did you realize when you completed nine holes that you're doing something quite special?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: When I turned on 18, I shoot 7-under, and I realize, and I got a little nervous.  Then exciting and yeah, just calm.   
 Q.  How exciting is that feeling on a golf course in a big championship in the final round?  It's what you dream of.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: It's a dream come true.  But I thought I shoot until 12-under, but I missed the hole 7, the par 3, the tee shot.  Yeah, that's a little bit make me upset.   
The next two holes, I bounce back, but yeah, also I'm very happy to be back.
