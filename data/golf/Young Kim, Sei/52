 Q.  Can you talk about the six in a row, how you got on a roll and how you kept it on a roll?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, it was awesome.  I just trying to kept first hole think about it, because that's pretty helpful my mindset.   
So, yeah, after kept think about it like result in six in a row birdies.  Yeah, I'm very happy with that.   
 Q.  You had a 61 earlier this year.  Did it kind of feel the same today where were just in the zone?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, pretty similar because yesterday got rain, so greens are pretty softer, so was able to like attack the pins.  So I made a lot of birdie opportunities myself, so, yeah.

So, yeah, I had good -- I took a lot of advantage today.   
 Q.  You know what it was like last year.  Scores kept going down, down, down.  How do you approach the rest of the weekend knowing you'll have to keep this up?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, the last year I shoot 9-under final round, so if I played well second round or third round, but I wasn't the good player the second round so...   
I feel great I begin really well like with a 9-under.
