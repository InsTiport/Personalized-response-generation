Q. Very good round today.  Tell us how you feel about how you played.
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was a little rough in the beginning because of the wind blowing, but concentrating on each hole, one by one, I think I was able to play well.
Q. You had a good round.  You're near the top of the leaderboard at the Women's Open.  Is that a positive day for you?  How do you feel about that?
SEI YOUNG KIM: It's been a good day.  Especially since I've come to the LPGA, the U.S. Women's Open has been one I've really wanted to win and get good results.  But I haven't been able to see the good results yet, but this is one I really want to do well on.
Q. How does your back feel?  Are you over whatever that was?  Are you feeling really confident with your health now?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I think the problem with my back was the way I swung.  And first since I've changed that up, I've been feeling good and healthy.  Warming up last week, I think there was a little problem with my elbow, but I think I will do well.
Q. Did the three weeks off help?  You took three weeks off.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes, definitely, I think that's helped.  Especially spending time with my coach from Korea and spending time with my parents, it's helped me refresh for this game.
Q. Finally, there's been a lot of talk this week about having to be disciplined and not go with the flags.  Some of them are in positions where you just can't go for it.  Do you think that is the case, and were you able to do that today?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I know following the flag, if you follow the flag, then you might not be able to make some moves so you got to swing smart and pin where you pin and swing where you swing and so forth.
