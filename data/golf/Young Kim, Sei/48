Q. (Recording in progress.)
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I was pretty solid.  Another good round today.  Yeah.  And then I thought pretty good weather front nine, but a little bit of strong -- a little bit of wind.  It's not little; pretty strong wind.  So it was a little tough to judge the number front nine.  After turn the front nine wind is pretty calm, so was able to attack to the pins so make a lot of birdie.  Another one.  (Laughter.)
Q. You play with an 8-shot lead.
SEI YOUNG KIM: 8-shot lead now?  I couldn't see the leaderboard.  I just kept the focus of my game.
Q. Is that what have to do tomorrow, too?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, yeah, I mean, because make me more comfortable.  If I see the scoreboard I keep thinking about it, so that's not help for the good playing.
So, yeah, I just...
Q. Did you have any idea the margin was that big, that you had that big of a lead?  Were the crowds any indication?  As the round went on you got a little bit bigger of a crowd watching you?
SEI YOUNG KIM: No, not really.  Yeah, same as the first round.
Q. Did you know you tied the a 54-hole scoring record for the LPGA?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, yeah.  Two years at JTBC Founders Cup I shoot a 27-under.  Before tee off today I was, Ah, if I shoot like 8-under or 7-under it's possible to the, yeah, my course record or my score or total record, yeah.  I hope to break it tomorrow.
Yeah, but I don't think about it.  I just keep focus my game.
Q. What's been the difference this week?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Well, after last week I was disappointed because I prepared a lot with my caddie for the major.  It wasn't good result.  I kept think about it, What's wrong with me?  I just ask to somebody but that's not right answer, so I getting to the YouTube, how to make the mind stronger.  Yeah, I watches a lot of video.
Yeah, that's a little bit of help my mindset stronger.
Q. What was some of the advice or anything you've done out here this week?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Like kind of same advice:  just trust yourself.  But before this week even I heard that, I didn't trust myself.  Yeah, even I have potential.  But after the major tournament I realize, Okay, I can do that.  Yeah.
If I imagine, it's come true.  It's come true.
Q. What did you learn from your experience at ShopRite earlier this season?
SEI YOUNG KIM: ShopRite?
Q. Uh-huh.  You had the lead in the final round.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.  I was going really good.  Third round I shoot 9-under, and then final round I miss a lot because I got a lot of nervous.  It's unusual to me.  I was shaky my hand after I had three -- no, no, when I had three holes.
Last hole I hit a shank.  I was like, What the hell is going on?  (Laughter.)
So, yeah, I think that happened make me like, What's the right way, because that way wasn't right.  That's reason why result kind of bad.  Yeah.
Q. You're on a roll here.  I mean, is this as good as you think you've played on the LPGA so far?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Sorry?
Q. Is this the best you've been playing in your career?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, it's ever.  Ever in life, yeah.
Q. What's it feel like stepping up to the tee box or on the green?
SEI YOUNG KIM: It's feel really comfortable, but sometimes when I play bad I really like too much is try.  But this week just relax and feel comfortable, relax walking on the course.  Just see the nice course, the nice view.
Yeah.
