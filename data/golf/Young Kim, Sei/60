 Q.  Thoughts on today?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, today is unfortunately really bad weather.  Like blustery wind, very strong wind and raining.  Yeah, I charged a good distance and hitting it good and I finish really good.  I'm very happy with 3-under in this weather.   
 Q.  And right at the end, your last three holes were something special, weren't they?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, starting at 16 hole, it was a lot of rain.  It was just tough standing, holding the umbrella.  The wind, it take off my umbrella.  It was really tough to focus on each shot.  But keep focused and like few seconds, but yeah, good finish.   
 Q.  Were you going for an eagle at the last?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I thought going for eagle but just missed it, almost lipped-out.  The wind pushed the ball.  Yeah, just miss it, but I have more tomorrow.   
 Q.  Of course tomorrow now, you've got a great chance sharing the lead with Karrie Webb and Cristie Kerr not far behind.  A lot of experience, those two, playing in these conditions.  But you've shown this week that you can play in pretty much anything.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I've never played before like in this weather.  It was a really great experience, and to play with -- it is rare to play with like veteran players, Cristie Kerr and then Karrie Webb.  They are really great players.  Yeah, it was a good experience with them, and anyway, with the weather.   
 Q.  How far was the eagle putt?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just three metres.
