Q. 3-under is a good round out here in these conditions.  What are your thoughts?
SEI YOUNG KIM: This golf course is totally different than what we usually play, links golf.  Yeah, very happy with a good score on this course.  It was a strong wind, so a little struggle playing a couple holes in the beginning.  But yeah, I'm very happy with a strong finish.
Q. How much links golf have you played?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Two years ago, first time I played the links golf at the British Open.  Yeah, that was the first time.  This is the second time.
Q. Do you enjoy it?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, it was fun.  Probably if it makes it in the bunker, it's bogey bunker.  The rough better than bunker, so yeah.  If they are in the fairway bunker, I avoided that, and I picked the rough.  Yeah, that's better.
le times it happened.  No, it didn't affect me.
