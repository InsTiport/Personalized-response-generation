THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce Sei Young Kim, who shot a 7-under 65 today at Thornberry Creek.  What was working well for you.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Today my shot solid today, and greens were softer, so I was able to go after the pins and give myself a lot of birdie opportunities.  And then putting was good, and I made a lot of birdies, yeah.
THE MODERATOR: You were bogey-free on your back nine, the front nine here.  Anything particular stand out to you during that stretch?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I didn't miss any short putts, but from 9, at the second hole I missed a really short putt, like one-foot putt, and then I got a little bit of shock, and it's like -- I said, okay, any more -- okay, focus on it, keep focusing.  Yeah, it works.
THE MODERATOR: You're one of our winners already this season.  You won at the Lorena Ochoa Match Play.  How does it feel to get off to another good start today?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Today?  It's been a long time since I played well in the first round, so yeah, I'm very blessed to have shot a 7-under.  We have three more days, and I'm looking forward to the other days.
Q. How do you like the golf course here?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I like the course.  All the par-5s, if I hit a good tee shot, I'm able to hit in two shots.  If I hit a good tee shot, I can make a lot of birdie chances, yeah.  That's good advantage for me.
Q. How does it feel to get off to a good start here, especially with the U.S. Women's Open next week?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, a lot of people are looking forward to the next tournament.  Yeah, I hopefully play well and then hopefully play well, too, in the U.S. Open.
