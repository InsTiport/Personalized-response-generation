  Q. It seemed very cold this morning, but you got off to a hot start.  Walk us through how you were playing early.
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, it's feel very solid in the morning because we got the strong wind, but I -- my shot really solid.  After I had four birdie I feel like it's not good.  Yeah, it feel like getting -- it's not used to.
 So I had two bogey and I had few miss shot, and then I try to, yeah, just relax and got me back on normal feel.
 So, yeah, I was able to finish it normal.
 Q. Did you feel like as you came down the stretch that you were confident that you could hold it together, even though you didn't perhaps have your best stuff?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, sometimes even I played very solid I try to keep pushing and try to get more birdie, but today is little different.  I just, yeah, don't think about the result.  I think that is the reason why I play well, yeah.
 Q. How much confidence do you have even when you maybe hit a bad shot because you played so well on this golf course in the past?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   What is that?
 Q. How much confidence do you have that you can still play well because of your history on this golf course?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   This golf course fit my eyes because good for the draw.  Yeah, draw, ball striking, because I think like Lexi and Nelly, they also like straight little draw.
 But, yeah, I think this golf course is really good for me, yeah.
 Q. And the last question from me:  You had talked about wanting to get to No. 1 in the world.  You played with No. 1 in the world today.  Is there extra motivation being out with Jin Young?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  I think my spot really exciting to chase the world ranking No. 1.  So, yeah, I'm very look forward this weekend and it's going to be fun.  Yeah, exciting.
 Q. 3-under par 69 today.  What was working for you?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   I play quite solid when I starting, because when I pass the hole 5 already 4-under.
 But after, yeah, 4-under I got little -- yeah, wasn't feel good, and then I had two bogey.  After that little struggle myself.
 And then, yeah, but I try to finish strong, and, yeah, I'm very happy with.  Yeah, wasn't bad result today, uh-huh.
 Q. Couple different conditions with the weather.  Cooler this morning and some more wind.  Take me through how you had to adjust to the conditions today.
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, today little cooler and little wind -- no, a lot of windy today.  So it's tough to judge a good number.  But when I got to hole 18 and then not over, really tough to judge the number today.
 So even that I try to keep focus on the, yeah, my number, and then, yeah, keep it up.
 Q. You didn't have any warm clothing you were telling me.  After Houston, the cool weather there, you didn't bring any of your warm clothes.  What did you have to do to prepare for the cold weather?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, I don't have.  Yesterday after Paul told me, my caddie Paul told me it's going to be cold weather in the morning, so I don't have any clothes because my manager took all my clothes when we finish Houston.
 So, yeah, I bought new jacket yesterday and, yeah, little warm today.
 Q. Not expecting that in Florida.
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, not expect in Florida, yeah.
 Q. So you'll be chasing the world No. 1 over the weekend in search of your second straight win here at the CME Group Tour Championship.  How special is it to be chasing the world No. 1 in hopes of winning this event again?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, I'm very looking forward this weekend because it's going to be -- my position is really exciting to chase the world ranking No. 1.
 Yeah, I'm very exciting and then look forward, and then I hopefully play well this weekend.
