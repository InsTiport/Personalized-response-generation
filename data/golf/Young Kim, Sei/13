  Q. Was today a little more work than you expected?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, just if I play same as last three days, yeah, I expect for sure.  But Ally played quite pressure me when I turn the nine because my shot feeling wasn't good.
 So I was a little, yeah, (indiscernible) my head.  It was going to three-shot lead.  When I go to three-shot lead I was like, Oh, my God, she can't be like chase me.  I was like, Okay, Sei Young, focus, keep going.  Yeah.
 Q. Well you did it well.  Congratulations.  Enjoy the celebration.
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Thank you.
