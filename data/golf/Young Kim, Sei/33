 Q.  Sei Young, awfully impressive show today.  Lexi referred to the type of golf you played this round, especially mid-round, as just crazy.  Was that some of the best you've got?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.  I'm very happy to win this tournament.  Especially this tournament, because Marathon Classic is a lot of history; 35 years this year.   
So yeah, I'm very happy to win this tournament.   
 Q.  Does it change your goals for the rest of the season, especially with two majors coming up?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I didn't set goal yet, but I wish I could win the major tournament.  Yeah, that's on my list.   
 Q.  You don't carry a lob wedge, but you hit two of the most incredible lob shots today by everybody's recollection.  Do you think your short game was just as important to this win?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I think this golf course really greens are hard, and then if I not flop shot, no chance to make the tap-in par.   
So whatever happen, I just try hit the ball to the sky and that makes a good result.
