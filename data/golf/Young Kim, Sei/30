Q. So 3-under today.  What part of your game was working well for you?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I was quite solid shot today overall but I miss several putt.  I had a lot have chance for birdie, but I think I read wrong because this golf course have a lot of mountain (indiscernible), so, yeah, I miss that.  Try to keep talking with my caddie and then figure it out.
Q. How is your putting?
SEI YOUNG KIM: How is putting?  So-so.  Yeah, so-so.  Hopefully make the lot of putt rest of two rounds, rest of the round.  Yeah.  And then I'm going to practice after round, yeah.
Q. Coming into the week what was your mentality?  What were you focusing on?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just try to relax but play like just regular tournament.  It is major so I don't put it any extra pressure; just take it easy and then relax.  That's my mindset.
Q. So you posted 6-under, just a couple shots behind the leader.  Strategy going into the weekend?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I don't want to predict the future.  I just stay in the present.  That's the best way to play well, play better.
