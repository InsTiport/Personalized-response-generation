 Q.  So how was today's round?  Felt like up and down, right?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: It wasn't good today because first three hole.  (Indiscernible.)  Three straight birdie after that.  I don't know.  I feel it wasn't comfortable, so I try to figure out what's the problem.   
Back nine I found it and then trying to play better.  It was good, but hole 17 my second shot in the hazard, so that's kind of bad momentum to me.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Except that, wasn't bad.   
 Q.  Yeah.  So you went to the range.  What were you working on right after the round?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just rhythm.  Yeah, because when I thinking too much my rhythm is too like strong.  So I trying to smooth, yeah, and consistently.   
 Q.  But does it still feel good to be in the lead going into tomorrow?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  I hope play well tomorrow, but who is play with me?   
 Q.  Carlota is tied for the lead.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah it's going to be fun.  Just enjoy.   
 Q.  Have you played with her much before?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, we played in the U.S. Open this year.   
 Q.  Really.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Cool.  Got you.  What has been the key for you so far this week?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just hit the fairway and just middle of the green, keep the middle of the green.  Yeah, and then putt, if I made it, yeah, that was key.   
 Q.  So more middle of the green instead of trying to hit it at the flag?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Sometime depend where the pin position.  Because this course has a lot of undulation we can use the backstop.  Depend pin position.  A lot of option.
