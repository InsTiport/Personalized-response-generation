Q. How was it today?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I got booster the back nine because the front nine I had a lot of chance but I miss a few putts after that.  Right after yesterday, I need some today, but yeah, I did.
Q. Your caddie said you hit it really good all day, just the putts weren't falling.  Is that how you felt?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes.  I missed a lot of putts also yesterday.  Like I made a lot of chance, but it was tough to read right the breaks yesterday.
Today I just don't -- too much think about it.  Just look up the hole and then just go.
Q. Just played free?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.
Q. Today kind of feel like a few weeks ago back at Green Bay when you were just rolling along?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Kind of.  It feels similar.  Right after Green Bay, I was trying to same as Green Bay when I played, but it wasn't because still a lot of things going on in my head, last two tournaments.  So that's the reason why I played, not really good.
Today before I played today, I'm just setting my goal, just not thinking.  Just go, whatever pin position, even really tough pin position, that a lot of help today.
Q. So what do you take away from this week?
SEI YOUNG KIM: This week kind of really totally different golf course than the states and my country, Korea.  So I need more strategy about around the green and the bunker, like how do I avoid the bunker.  It's kind of annoying.  I'm very like aggressive player, but I have to play conservatively every hole.
After two rounds, I was like headache, too much thinking.
Q. What's your schedule coming up?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I'm going back to my country, Korea.  It's been like seven months, because I live in Dallas.  So skip Indy and ready for Canada.
