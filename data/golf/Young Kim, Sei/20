  Q. You had a birdie after your ninth hole and your tenth hole.  How important was that for your momentum today?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   I had a lot of chances.  Front nine, to me, starting front nine, hole 10, but I miss it 11, 12, 13.  It was pretty short putts.  But I was a little disappointed.  But I tried to keep -- make myself like --
 Q. The momentum?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, good momentum and positive everything.  Yeah, I think I finished -- it wasn't what I want, but yeah, I finished.  It's not bad.  It was not bad.
 Q. You still have two rounds; how do you feel confidence-wise going into the last two rounds?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   This golf course, the greens are really hard, firm.  You have to pitch to the right number and then, yeah, if you focus on it, you can get a good score.  I think this weekend just focus on what I have to do.  Hopefully I finish strong this weekend.
 Q. How about the course conditions, the Bermudagrass?  How difficult is it out there?
 SEI YOUNG KIM:   I live in Dallas.  It's the same as a Dallas golf course.  So yeah, it feels like similar.  Yeah, it feels -- yeah.

 SEI YOUNG KIM:   He always makes fun during the tournament, and relax, yeah.  We're just the same feeling, even major tournament.  We don't put any extra pressure.  Yeah, we just hopefully have fun until we finish it out.
