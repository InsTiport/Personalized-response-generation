MICHAEL HOEY: Golf was good.  It was really windy and I think I had five birdies.  With the five birdies, I think I was 3- or 4-under depending on if I made bogey or double on the 13th.  So that was good golf.  Probably win against most people out there.   
It's all about getting off to a good start.  Got off to a good start, holed a few putts.  Kristoffer was a bit unlucky at the start.  I've got off to a good start the last two days.   
 Q.  We can hear the effect of the wind.  It's not easy out there, is it.  
MICHAEL HOEY: Different wind direction today, as well.  There's a few chances, a few drivable greens on 8 and 9.  But you have to get the right bounce and you have to chip well because you're going to miss greens and I chipped really, really good.  Fortunately I'm still in the tournament.   
 Q.  Not so much fortune, is it, if you consider the way you've played across the days, there's good process, isn't it?  
MICHAEL HOEY: 2-over yesterday, 3- or 4-under today.  Much better golf today actually.  Was quite lucky yesterday and played good today, so looking forward to see whatever happens tomorrow.   
 Q.  Do you look ahead and see who you're going to be playing next or do you think very much that you've got two rounds in a day if you're successful?  
MICHAEL HOEY: Well, I think it's GrÃ©gory Havret or Seve Benson.  Look, everyone's good out here.  There's nothing in it over 18 holes.  Somebody can make six birdies and you get beaten straightaway or you can make six birdies and win easily.   
Just excited, it's a different format and it's really enjoyable.   
 Q.  So what about that, two rounds in a day?  
MICHAEL HOEY: I don't know if I'm fit enough for that.  Hopefully I am.  Getting old these days.  Yeah, it's like amateur golf again.  It's all good.
