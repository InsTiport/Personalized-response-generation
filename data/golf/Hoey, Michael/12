Q.   A round of 66 to go with yesterday's 68 at Carnoustie; how did your play compare on the two days? 
MICHAEL HOEY:   Probably needed‑‑ I made five birdies in a row yesterday which is the most I've ever made in a row was four previously and that really got me going, because I was 1‑over at Carnoustie and I thought I needed to turn it around. 
Hit a few good wedge shots and holed a couple of putts, and that really‑‑ it was looking borderline yesterday and from then I kicked on and holed a few putts and hit the ball pretty good.

Q.   Today you said you went around without a five, and that's just the first time, isn't it? 
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, my caddie said to me, no fives, probably the first time ever.   But perfect conditions.   I mean, links, absolutely no wind; everyone is tearing it apart.   But you still have to do it.   You still have to get the ball in the hole.

Q.   Do you get a warm glow when you come back here right from the moment you arrive because you've won this championship in the past. 
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, great feelings.   Love the golf courses; Carnoustie, Kingsbarns, doesn't get any better and we've been lucky with the weather.   Playing partners are great fun.   Just trying to feed off the positivity. 

Q.   Your only Top‑20 this year is a win; how do you explain that? 
MICHAEL HOEY:   My stats are quite weird but I'm up‑and‑down, but I will get more consistency eventually.   I've got a good coach now, and a couple good coaches here helping me stay on track.   That's the plan.
