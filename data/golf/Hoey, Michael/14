  MICHAEL HOEY:   I actually played almost the same, 36 putts.   They had not cut the greens because the potential, the winds were going to be strong, so the ball was not rolling as quick.   Didn't quite have the pace of the greens.   Hit the ball just as good.   
So I'm actually quite happy with how I'm playing.   Score didn't work out today.  
   
 Q.   You don't sound too disheartened.   
MICHAEL HOEY:   No, I'm really happy.   Just got stuck in the bunker on the sixth, and that was it really.   Made double‑bogey there which you shouldn't have done, because it was a sand wedge from a bunker.   Came up short, chipped on, 3‑putted.   
So just scoring, that's what golf is, so I'm happy with how I'm hitting it.  
   
 Q.   Because of the good score yesterday, you're still well there going into the weekend?  
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, I've still made the cut which is always good, and you know, if I'm out earlier tomorrow, I think the weather is going to be good, I can shoot a few good few under par and still move up into a chance.
