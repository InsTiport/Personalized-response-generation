  MICHAEL HOEY:   The greens were a lot faster and was probably too aggressive on a couple of putts and 3‑putted.   14 at least I was aggressive.   But lost my rhythm a little bit, but by the fourth or fifth hole, found a bit of rhythm.   A bit tricky, pins were tucked away today, so the defense of the golf course.   The fairways are pretty narrow and the rough is pretty thick.   A good weekend, good finish, can be right up there.   
   
 Q.   The three bogeys in a row‑‑  
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, just a little bit quick, which the usual tendency with the rhythm.   The greens were a bit quicker and always breaking left, so I was relying a little too much on the greens but at least came back from that.   Going to go hit a few balls to show it down a bit.   
   
 Q.   Is that the bonus that you got it back and no damage done?   
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, certainly a good score was on.   Felt I could have shot five or six.   Obviously Graeme's done that but not totally out of it.  
   
 Q.   Birthday cake now?   
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, first birthday.   Glad didn't miss the cut‑‑ didn't want to miss the cut here on the first birthday.   Yeah, we'll have a few celebrations.
