  Q. How does that feel?   
 MICHAEL HOEY: Good, really good. I knew I needed to birdie the last there. Just didn't quite -- it wasn't playing that difficult. Still solid and I putted well. Not many mistakes really. Enjoying the sunshine. Great place, Kingsbarns.  
  
  Q. Are you enjoying the Pro-Am format?  
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah.   
  
  Q. A bit more relaxed?   
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, always have done. A couple of years ago I was tied for the lead after two rounds, and I mean, it's slow, but it really takes your mind off stuff between shots.  
  
  Q. And did you feel your game was in good shape heading into the tournament?   
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, been working on putting a lot. That's improved a lot. Obviously on the Old Course, particularly, greens are so big. So I putted well today. And chipping has been really good as well. It's mostly short game. Working hard with my swing coach, Jamie, as well, Jamie Gough, so he's helped me a lot. And I just enjoy the links.  
  
  Q. And you've won already this season, but a slightly bigger tournament; it would be awesome to win here?  
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, it's just nice to do well in the big ones, because I did reasonable in Wentworth, and there are lot of big ones in the end of the year. Hopefully I can get a few World Ranking points and keep going the next two days.
