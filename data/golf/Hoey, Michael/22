  MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, eagled the second, nice putt there, and then good birdie on the 9th and then just lost my rhythm a bit.   It's a fine line, golf.   
   
 Q.   30,000 people here today and crowds have been fantastic and backing you this week?  
MICHAEL HOEY:   Yeah, unbelievable, for me it obviously feels like a major tournament really.   Disappointing not to play as well in front of them down the last few holes, but that's golf sometimes.   
   
 Q.   From where you are, is it too far back to make a challenge tomorrow do you think?   
MICHAEL HOEY:   Probably, yeah, just want to shoot a good score and just finish on a high note really, hit a few good swings tomorrow.
