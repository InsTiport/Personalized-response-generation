 Q. Great finish for you. Give us your thoughts on today. 
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, just really enjoyed it playing with Shane, know him really well, roomed with him earlier in the year a couple of times, was swinging the club well to start, was 4-under early after nine. Really could have shot 6- , 7-under but the fact that I head on well, my best finish in a big event for a long time, probably Portugal last year. 

 Q. Nice to get your best finish of the season?
 MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, I think I'll gain a few more World Ranking points, take it with me, a couple of weeks off and reflect on it. It's a great atmosphere. 

 Q. How much did it help you playing with the defending champion? 
 MICHAEL HOEY: He's a great guy. I roomed with him in Qatar in the start of the year.
