 Q.  I take it that's music to the ears, shooting 7&6 to win so handsomely?  
MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, didn't expect that, but I had five birdies again, and it was good golf.  I put Greg under a bit of pressure.  He didn't have his best day but started out par, birdie, birdie, par, par, par, birdie, par, birdie, and that is pretty good golf.  Trying to prepare myself for a tighter game this afternoon.   
 Q.  Are you feeling better as the event goes on?  
MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, conditions do suit me.  I'm remembering some shots from a long time ago when I won the British Amateur and I'm trying to get used to playing little low, control shots in the wind.  I'm holing a few putts, so, yeah, looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Presumably it's like other times, other match play, you get ahead; are you feeling that much more confident and controlled?  
MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, feels like you're leading the tournament when you're ahead and you're just trying to keep the pressure on.  Got off to a good start the last three matches.  The start is important, trying to get up early and keep the pressure on.  It's a mental thing but it's enjoyable.   
 Q.  Did you fancy your chances before we even started?  
MICHAEL HOEY: You never know if you play good and get beaten the first round.  I fancied -- I always enjoyed match play, links course.  Everyone said you can do well this week.  You never know what can happen but looking forward to that quarterfinal.   
 Q.  Looks like Kiradech Aphibarnrat.  
MICHAEL HOEY: Yeah, I saw he was 5-up against Thomas Aiken.  He's a very natural player:  Grips it, rips it.  It will be tough, I'm sure, but conditions are going to get really windy, a bit of rain coming in.  It's going to be a tough mental battle.  Bogeys could be halving holes if the weather comes in.  We'll see.
