   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Can we go over your scorecard really fast? 
 ANGELA PARK:  Started on 10.  Bogey on 10.  Do I have to say what club and --  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Yeah, how far out you were and all that. 
 ANGELA PARK:  130 yards, 9-iron to the bunker.  It got plugged and I hit it out to about ten feet and missed the putt there. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  130 yards? 
 ANGELA PARK:  Yes.  And then all the way -- I parred all the way to No. 2.  I hit 6-iron from 162 yards, I think.  Made that putt. 
 And then on 3 I hit it in the bunker.  On my second shot I hit it out to about seven feet and made that. 
 Bogey on 4 and 5.  4 I hit it to right and had a chip out to the green.  Chipped and one putt. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  How far was the chip? 
 ANGELA PARK:  About only three yards off the green.  Extremely downhill. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  To how close. 
 ANGELA PARK:  To about five feet. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  And you made it or missed it? 
 ANGELA PARK:  I made that.  And then No. 5, about 140 yards, 7-iron to about 25 feet and 3-putted. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay. 
 ANGELA PARK:  And then on 7, I hit a 6-iron from 160 yards to about 12 feet and made that. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Can you just talk about your round?  I mean, you're still in the top part of the leaderboard right now. 
 ANGELA PARK:  I was really nervous out there today obviously as a rookie.  I don't know, I just went out there today just trying to stay calm like I did yesterday.  Nothing to worry about. 
 My dad told me before I came out today to just to relax and not to get too greedy on the course because that usually ruins your game.  So obviously I was a little bit nervous, but I'm glad their finished even par. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 ANGELA PARK:  She might be making a birdie on that Par 5.  I just saw it on TV. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 ANGELA PARK:  Yeah.  So Par 5.  But she has a birdie putt, so I might be three strokes back.  Who knows. 

 Q.  Are you concerned with how far back you are at this point or is it way too early? 
 ANGELA PARK:  Obviously in golf anything can happen in one hole and we still have 36 holes to go.  So three- or five- or ten-stroke lead is never too much of a lead to catch up to. 
 I'm not really thinking about that, though.  Just trying to go out there tomorrow and have a consistent round where I hit greens and fairways and make some putts. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Are you ever thinking out there?  Does it ever get to the point where you start to think too much, or do you just rely on your talent? 
 ANGELA PARK:  I think today actually the Front 9, which was my Back 9, I was thinking too much.  I told you I was a little bit nervous.  I got to a point where, you know, this is not going to work if you're going to be nervous every hole about 3-putting or making a birdie, it's not going to go in. 
 I've done that before.  I was in the lead and couldn't execute my shots thought the final round, so I learned from those mistakes.  I relaxed a little bit more on the Back 9 and made a couple putts and missed a couple, but still did a pretty good job today. 

 Q.  How about the weather tomorrow?  It sounds pretty nasty, is that a concern? 
 ANGELA PARK:  No.  Because this is the first time I heard the weather is going to be nasty. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Tee times is 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. 
 ANGELA PARK:  Uh-huh.  Get to sleep early tonight. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Anything else?  Just looking forward to the weekend going in close on the leaderboard, your thoughts on that? 
 ANGELA PARK:  I don't really want to think about it right now.  Just want to go home and take a nice shower and relax and hopefully the next few days I'll play my game and not look at the scoreboard. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Thank you.
