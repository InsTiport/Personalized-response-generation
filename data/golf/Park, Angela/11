 Q.  Angela Park who tied for second place at 3-under par, 281.  Angela, you became, you were in a position where you were very, very close to the lead out there.  What was going through your mind when that happened? 


ANGELA PARK: I don't know, nothing, really. I just tried to stay steady and stay calm out there. And try to play smart golf. Nothing in particular went through my mind, I just knew that I was getting close to the lead and I had a chance at it. 

 Q.  Everybody would ask you, do you look at the leader boards, do you see how you're doing in relation to the leaders? 
  ANGELA PARK: At the beginning of the round I try not to look at it as much as I would have. But at the end toward where I knew I was close to the leader, I kind of had a little sneak peak view, but other than that, no. 

 Q.  Which hole was that on? 
  ANGELA PARK: I think that was after I made my birdie on 15. But I knew I was somewhere around there. So it was not a surprise. 

 Q.  And then you followed that though with a bogey on 16 and one on 17.  Did you get a little bit rattled thinking, I'm pretty close to it? 
  ANGELA PARK: Oh, no, I never had that thought in my mind surprisingly. Because I would think that I would start worrying about where I am a little about position, but I just had a couple mental mistakes of my own out there. 

 Q.  All right.  Well it was a wonderful showing for one so young and in the U.S. Open, how do you think this will help you in coming years? 
  ANGELA PARK: Oh, this is a great experience, especially being able to play this well in the Women's Open, I don't know. 



 I'm just going to take whatever I can take from this and hopefully be a better player next year and the upcoming years.
