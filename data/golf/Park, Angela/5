  Q. So, is this something that you usually do, sinking 20-foot putts, or were you a little surprised?  
 ANGELA PARK: I've been putting really well lately, just haven't gotten everything all together. Wasn't hitting the ball exactly where I wanted to today, but was hitting it flawless, so that was good. I've been working a lot on my game, so hopefully it will turn out better than it usually has.   
  
  Q. What would it mean for you to be able to win this week?  
 ANGELA PARK: It's my dad's birthday on Sunday and he's not here, so it would be a gift for my dad, obviously, and a gift for myself. But it would mean a lot - a whole bunch - especially coming out of the country and trying to adjust to food, the time and everything, it's been a hassle, but I'm having a lot of fun. It's a beautiful place.  
  
  Q. Have you had any expectations this year after being (Louise Suggs Rolex) Rookie of the Year last year?  
 ANGELA PARK: A lot. Very high expectations. Not just me, but everyone around me did and it was kind of hard because, obviously, I wasn't getting to those expectations. But, like everyone says, it's all a learning process, so I'm still learning and I have a lot more years ahead of me, so I'm not going to put myself down.  
  
  Q. So, you're feeling confident, right now?  
 ANGELA PARK: Definitely my putting and my chipping, which was the weakest two parts of my game. It's coming along. Last year, I didn't do so well here, but I have a different feeling.  
  
  Q. Carrying on through the rest of the weekend, knowing you're among the top 90 players in the world right now.  
 ANGELA PARK: Yeah, that would be a lot of fun. Obviously, (Sun-Ju Ahn) from Korea. It was a lot of fun playing with her - she's a great player. I'll probably play with her tomorrow, which would be a lot of fun.
