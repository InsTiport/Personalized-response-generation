 Q.   What made the difference today?  
BECKY BREWERTON:   Just the putts to be honest.   Yesterday I hit it just as well, hit as many shots in close many only made four birdies.   Today I played really well and it was the putting that was the difference.   I lipped a few out yesterday but you have to stay patient around here, the greens are quite hard to read.   Yeah, everything just fell in.  
   
 Q.   Great end to the week and to the season for you?   
BECKY BREWERTON:   Yeah, I'm actually a bit upset the season is ending because obviously most of it passed me by without anything happening and it's just in the last four events I started to play well.   
Hopefully now I might have made enough money to be able to go to Australia, fingers crossed, which would be good, because obviously I want to play again as soon as possible.
