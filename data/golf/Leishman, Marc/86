 Q.  How tough a last hole is that?  
MARC LEISHMAN: It's tough when you drive it there all week.  I struggled with that tee shot all week.  Yeah, it's a tough hole especially with where the wind was.  I was really happy to get out of there with a par.   
 Q.  Did you feel the win was coming?  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: I've been playing well.  Actually had several chances to win this year, but just haven't played well on Sunday.  It's hard playing that well and not giving myself chances deep into Sunday.  But I felt like it was on the way.   
 Q.  So you get the win now.  And in a way it's nice that the next week was stroke play not match play?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yes, different.  Two days off, just played a nine hole practice round yesterday to save in energy.  And went out today with Lee, and hopeful luckily I had enough energy to play well and make some birdies.   
 Q.  How much energy does a victory on the first day give you?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, a lot, I'll get back -- I actually felt good out there today.  That competitive side of me gets the energy back up.  I feel good.   
 Q.  What's going to happen in two weeks' time?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Played well there before.  Looking forward to getting back there.  It's just nice to be back in it.  I wasn't in until two or three days ago.   
 Q.  Pretty happy with the win, keep things rolling since last week?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, really happy.  Energy level, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, after such a big week last week, I only played nine holes yesterday and took it pretty easy.  I got my competitive juices flowing, and it was good.  Really happy to win against a player like Lee.   
 Q.  A couple of years ago you faced Justin Rose.  He had come off a week.  And I remember you said he was a little gassed and you saw the opportunity.  Were you trying to guard against that being you?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely.  It was a real motivating factor to try and have energy.  You need to play good in this, when you get into these tournaments.   
 Q.  Talk about tomorrow's match.  Are you going to play the same game?  
MARC LEISHMAN: It doesn't change anything.  You're trying to win every match.  It's terrible what is going on with Jason's mom.  Obviously I wish her all the best and the whole Day family.  When your mind is not there, it's just hard to function.  That's hard.  I hope she can get through it.  And I wish him all the best.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Really excited.  Obviously to spend two weeks in Hawaii at the start of the year is huge.  The SBS Tournament of Champions is obviously a goal every year.  The last time I played there the weather was horrible.  I wanted to get back there ever since.  It's really nice to finally be back there.  And it's just an unbelievable place.   
It's exciting spending the week in Maui, especially because we'll spend Christmas in Virginia Beach this year, where it will be freezing.  So it's a good excuse to get out of there and get to the warm weather, as well.  So it's a win/win.
