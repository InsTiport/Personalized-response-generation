  Q. Maybe a couple comments about your first time playing here at East Lake this week.   
 MARC LEISHMAN: Probably a few nerves early, got off to a bit of a shaky start, but then fought back all right. Good to get it back to even par. Would have been even better to shoot a 1-under, but that bogey on the last got me back to even. But I feel it's a pretty good day all up.  
  
  Q. Looks like 3- or 4-under will probably be leading by the end of the day, so you certainly didn't shoot yourself out of the tournament by shooting par. Maybe some thoughts about the rest of the week.   
 MARC LEISHMAN: Hopefully I can hit a few more fairways than I did today. My trouble early was hitting the fairways. I holed a few good putts on the back nine for birdie. I need to hit more fairways and hole for putts, and hopefully shoot myself a low number in the next couple days.  
  
  Q. Feeling better mentally and physically after getting some rest?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely.  
  
  Q. You said you weren't going to touch a club until maybe Saturday.   
 MARC LEISHMAN: I didn't touch one until Monday, which ended up being Tuesday.  
  
  Q. Did you forget how to swing a club?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: No, I like having a bit of time off. I'm not the sort of guy who gets -- if I play too much golf, it wears you down. In my weeks off I like to not play golf.
