 Q.  Marc, very nice showing for you today.  Boy, coming down the stretch, so close on some of those putts.  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, hit some good putts, hit some good shots.  Played a lot better down the stretch this week than I did last week.   
Yeah, happy with the week.  Looking forward to getting back out to it in San Diego.   
 Q.  Overall you happy with both weeks?  I mean, overall you played really well.  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I did, yeah.  Some really good signs.  Just one round I guess both weeks that kind of helped me a little bit.   
No, happy.  Any time you can finish Top 5 or 6, whenever I end up finishing, it's a good week.  Hopefully I can continue this form for the rest of the year.   
Q: Not the finish you were looking for perhaps but plenty of positives to take away?   
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, for sure. If I could have made a few more putts today, then who knows what might have happened. But overall it is a good few weeks in Hawaii. Two good finishes and a nice bank of FedExCup points keeps me up there in the standings. Matty and I have talked about trying to get him the yellow leaders caddie bib at some stage this season, so hopefully this will be a good steppingstone heading to Torrey Pines.   
Q: Speaking of Torrey, you have a great record there. Excited to keep the Australian winner theme going another year?   
MARC LEISHMAN: That would be nice. Iâve had a few chances there in the past but havenât quite closed the deal, so Iâd like to do that. The form is obviously good, so Iâll take confidence there for sure.
