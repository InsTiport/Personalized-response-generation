MARC LEISHMAN: I'm where I wanted to be and I've played really well since then.  So give myself a chance with a low one tomorrow.  Obviously Gary's playing really well, as is Rory.  But I'll need a very low score, especially with the predicted wind drop, I guess.  No, this is right where I want to be.
Q. Do you feel you have to be more aggressive with that mindset tomorrow?
MARC LEISHMAN: I think so, yeah, especially with it not being as windy.  I think when it's blowing like this you have to be a little bit careful because bad shots get magnified in the wind.  Depends how everyone starts.  I need to get off to a good start.  It depends how the other boys start as well as to how aggressive I get.  But it's going to be very different.  I think it's a different direction, the wind, which we haven't played this course in, in those conditions very often.  And so it's sort of hard to tell what the scores are going to do, but, yeah, either way I'm going to have to play really good golf.
