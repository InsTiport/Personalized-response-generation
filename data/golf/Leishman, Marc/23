Q. A tough start, you got Tiger with five birdies, and he got off to a brilliant start, birdie on 1 it and 2.
MARC LEISHMAN: They got off to a really hot start. I don't think either of us played our best golf. Like I said at the start of the week, we have to play good golf to beat these guys. Unfortunately we didn't, but hopefully the other guys can get a few wins and you know finish the day ahead.
Q. When you look back at the round and the conditions, can you talk us through those moments for you?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I mean, the conditions were testing, but the pin positions weren't too bad. They were gettable. I mean, I didn't drive the ball as well as I would have liked.
The base of my 2-iron actually caved in on the range, so I had 13 clubs today, which is pretty frustrating, so I'll get that sorted tomorrow and hopefully come out and win some points.
Q. What about playing with the debutante out there today?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it's good. He's got a lot of game. We didn't quite have it today, but I think certainly got some points in us for later in the week.
