MARC LEISHMAN: Wasn't quite that pretty early on.  I hit a few good shots, birdied the first.  My wedges were really good today, which is pleasing.  A few loose shoots.  For the most part, I played pretty good.  Really good, actually.  Really happy to beat -- Lee is a great player.   
Everyone's going to have to play well to win today.  I'm happy to be one of those guys.   
 Q.  There's been a bit of drama today.  Jason Day's announced that his mother has got lung cancer, surgery on Friday.  He's pulled out.  He's in your group.  You were expected to play each other on Friday.  Just your thoughts given what your wife endured and what he might be going through.  
MARC LEISHMAN: I mean, that's horrible news.  Any time that one of your mates is going through something like that, it's tough.  It's hard to -- when it's happening, it's hard to do anything.  It's hard to function.  I really understand his decision.  It's a tough thing.   
Like I said, it's just hard to do daily things.  When Audrey was sick, I was backing into things in my car and not reacting.  It was like -- you would smash the rear vision mirror off your car and then you would like oh.  That's the sort of things that happen.   
He's got to do what he's got to do.  Family first, as always.  Hope his mom makes -- is okay.  It's not too serious.  Obviously cancer is serious, but wish him all the best.
