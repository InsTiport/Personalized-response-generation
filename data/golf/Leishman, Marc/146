 Q.   How did you feel about today, couple birdies and one bogey?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Pretty frustrated, to be honest.   I hit the ball pretty well and just putter didn't work right.   Didn't putt very well.   
I still shot a couple under, so that's a good day.   If I can hit it like I did today and hole some putts tomorrow, who knows what might happen.   Still I'll have to go pretty low again.   Looks like Bubba is sort of running away with it a little bit.   But there's definitely a good score out there, and hopefully I can do better for the final round.  
   
 Q.   After last year (inaudible) kind of keeping it together?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, exactly.   Yeah, I mean last year, I think 17 and 18 I played three over on Saturday.   So screwed up 17 with a three‑putt.   Looked like last year.   I double it last year.  
You're going to have bogeys throughout the week.   I think I've only had two or three for the whole week.   I just need to hole some more putts to get some birdies.   Who knows what can happen.   I proved last year that anything can happen and hopefully it'll happen again.  
   
 Q.   Are you having any flashbacks?   Depending on what Bubba does, you could be right in that six‑stroke‑back wheelhouse again.   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Hopefully I'm in that six‑stroke.   Not 10.   Hopefully I'm within reach and can at least give myself a chance to shoot 8 or 10‑under and have a chance.   But Bubba is playing pretty good, but like I said, who knows what might happen.
