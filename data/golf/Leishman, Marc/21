 Q.  A tough one out there today, and you had Haotong out there for the first time, a little bit of nerves for him early on?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, a few nerves as you'd expect. I don't think either of us played our best golf. Disappointing match for us, but hopefully we can get back out this afternoon and get another point and hopefully the boys can do something behind and get a few points on the board, as well.   
 Q.  The course today, we've seen a lot of players out of position, yet we didn't have much wind. Decision-making, how important is that going into the afternoon?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, especially in foursomes it is. The greens are actually quite a bit slower this morning than they were yesterday afternoon. That took a bit of adjusting. You can play more aggressive in four-ball. You just have to be on that edge, I guess. You can't be too aggressive.   
The boys played pretty well, so hopefully we can play good this afternoon.   
 Q.  Do you have any indication of who you might be out with and will you be out there?  
MARC LEISHMAN: I have absolutely no idea. I don't know what's going on. Wait and see I guess. I think they are doing the picks pretty soon. I'll finds out if I'm playing or not and who I'm playing with.
