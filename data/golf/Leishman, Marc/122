  MARC LEISHMAN: It was nice to give myself a few birdie chances and hole a couple of good par putts, which kept me going.   Q.  17 was big?  MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it was.  That was really big.  You bogey that, and you have probably no chance of shooting par.  You're going to be quite a few shots back at the end of the day.  To make that and birdie the last was a great way to finish the day.   Q.  You said that managing your frustrations were giving you a bit of trouble on 16 and 17.  Are you dealing with that quite well?  MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I'm actually dealing with it really well, touch wood.  Hopefully I won't have to manage too much frustration for the next few days.  Get on the fairways and the greens, and having short birdie putts. But when I do get in a bit of trouble, I've managed to get myself out of it this week, and hopefully I can continue to do that.   Q.  Anything can happen with the weather over the weekend.  Have you thought about that (inaudible)?  MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I feel good.  Like I said, the weather can do anything.  So if you can just get out there, make a few birdies and post a score, like you really don't know what the leaders are going to do. Yeah, I'm happy with where I am.  You could always be closer to the lead.  But 3-under, it's a good spot to be in after two days.   Q.  The best British Open so far?  I bit of relief you found a bit of rhythm?  MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it's good to just get in the grass with the links golf again.  We only play it once a year.  And it's just completely different to anything else.  It's a heavier wind.  The ball runs out 50, 60, 70 meters.  And it's just night and day to what we play in America.  It's nice to finally come to grips with it and handle it a little bit better.   Q.  It was a really nice score, the way you are playing?  MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I hope so.  I'm definitely playing well enough to shoot a low round.  And the putter feels good in my hand, so there's no reason why not.  Maybe a low one tomorrow might be 70, who knows.  2-under might be a real low one depending on the weather.  Yeah, I feel if I can just keep doing what I'm doing, keep limiting the mistakes, I'll be in a good spot.
