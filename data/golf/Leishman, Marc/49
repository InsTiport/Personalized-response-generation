 Q. A round of 70. That was the Sunday back nine that you wanted, wasn't it?  
MARC LEISHMAN: It was, yeah. It was nice to finish off like that and make it a top‑10 and get me back here next year. But, yeah, not the day that I was after but.  
   
 Q. You seemed to straighten your game up at the back nine?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, something happened with the driver, which will help me for the rest of the year, which is good. You try to hit it a bit harder and further and worked that out. It only took me 50 something holes. But, yeah, better to find that way than never. Putting is feeling good. The greens calmed down a bit. I struggled early to get the pace of the greens. You've got to adjust.   
   
 Q. What are your reflections?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, a good week. We were talking about it coming up 17. And we were saying you'd rather have two good‑‑ two good first rounds, obviously you'd want to have four good rounds, but you're right in the thick of it and amongst it on the weekend rather than play average the first two days and have a back door top‑10, and never have a chance to win. Plenty of positives to take out of it. Looking forward to next week and the next major.   
   
 Q. Tell me, how do you walk away from Augusta? What frame of mind? Can't wait to get back? Lost opportunities? Where does the needle fit?   
MARC LEISHMAN: Probably all of the above. You know, I wish it maybe hadn't rained yesterday, it might have been a different story. But it might not have been, too. But you look forward to coming back here every year, that finish will get me back here guaranteed next year, which is nice. Leave slightly disappointed, but satisfied at the same time. It would have been easy to throw the towel in and finish 20th or whatever I was sitting at. So I'm never one to give up. And certainly not around here.
