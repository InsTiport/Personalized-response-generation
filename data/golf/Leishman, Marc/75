Q. How happy are you with the play today?
MARC LEISHMAN: Very happy.  Last week with the putter was frustrating and put in a lot of work early in the week, especially the putting.  Happy with how that all went today.
Q. You mentioned the putting -- let's have a look at one of the highlights here.  This one here, this is to go 4-under par for your round.  What have you been doing with the putting to turn it around?
MARC LEISHMAN: Just matching speed and the line.  Last week the speed wasn't very good and this week it's a little better.  Did a lot of work on charting the greens this week and certainly paid off there.
Q. Lots of players struggling out there.  You obviously weren't one of them.  For you, what was the hardest bit, because it was breezy and cold.  What was the hardest thing for you out there today?
MARC LEISHMAN: The tee shots.  A lot of them, the wind was off the left, and you couldn't tell if it was in or down, and then the approaches were tough, as well.  So it was a hard day.  I'm glad I putted well.  Seems a lot easier when you can roll the putts in.
Q. You're having a great season, you won the Arnold Palmer invitational and 20th in the FedExCup.  That all could change very quickly here.  Is that something you enjoy about the Playoffs?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, there's a lot to gain and a lot to lose.  Missed the cut by a shot last week and dropped six spots, and THE TOUR Championship is in jeopardy.  But you have a good week this week, and you can jump into that top five.
Yeah, I think it's a good format.  Brings a lot of excitement to the end of the year.  It's great for the TOUR.
Q. You're 20th in the FedExCup rankings, pretty comfortable way to open up today.  Six birdies and just two bogeys.  Pretty good position, I would say.
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, happy with it.  Like I said, pretty tough conditions.  Nice to get off to a good, solid start.  Especially after last week, dropping a few spots and missing the cut.  I feel like I've got a lot to play for this week.
Q. And The Presidents Cup coming up at the end of the month.  Talk about the excitement level for that event?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it's going to be awesome, especially being in New York City, the crowds are going to be huge.  I think the internationals have a good team this year and hopefully this can be the year we can finally knock the Americans off.  It's been a while.
Q. With an opening round like this, you can not worry too much about the FedExCup rankings and just go ahead and focus on winning this tournament.
MARC LEISHMAN: Exactly.  That's what a good first round does.  I feel like that's been a big difference this year.
Years past, I feel like I've been coming from behind and fighting to get myself back into tournaments.  This year, there's been a lot more good first rounds and then you're not thinking about making the cut or just scraping through.  You're looking at the top of the leaderboard and really thinking about making birdies, which is a pretty good mind-set to have.
