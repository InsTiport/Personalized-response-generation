 Q. Looking back on the week and the opportunity to go to the White House and meet the President, something you'll always cherish?MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, definitely.  The White House is one place I never thought I would be inside, that's for sure.  But it was a great experience to meet the President and see all that security and all the memorabilia and whatever you call it in there, the artwork and all that.  So it was awesome to see that.  Hope I get back there again.  Could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Q. Way back in '84, Norman made this his first-ever win on TOUR.  Obviously more history than that but the fact that Greg won here; this golf course seems to your style.  What do you feel is your main objective?  You said yesterday it was fairways.MARC LEISHMAN: It's really difficult.  Same again, fairways, and try to get the ball in the hole. Didn't putt well at all yesterday.  Gave myself probably enough chances to shoot a really good score, and just didn't putt well enough.  So need to putt better.  But, you know, hit the fairways -- you need to hit the fairways.
