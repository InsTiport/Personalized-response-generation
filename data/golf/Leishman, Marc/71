 Q.  Is this as good a stretch as you played for quite sometime?  
MARC LEISHMAN: The game is feeling really good.  Obviously rolling the putts really well.  But, you know, you have to give yourself the opportunities.   
You know, it's talking about the first two rounds but lot of work to do.  Last week I showed a couple shots going into the back-9.  Hopefully I can keep doing what I'm doing.  Lot of great players just behind me, so you, know I need to keep the foot on the pedal.   
 Q.  The stroke, you've been putting a little better like you did at the start of the year.  You also done a lot of work back at home as well.  Give us an indication how many hours to get the feel like you're bringing to the Playoffs?  
MARC LEISHMAN: I think it's a fine line between too much practice and not enough for me.  I need to have a really good balance.  I don't like playing too much golf on my off weeks but I still need to keep the short game sharp.  That little tip that Dennis gave me has been huge.  Old habits tend to come back.  When you can get on top of them quickly, that's really nice.  Obviously the putting green at home is great.   
 Q.  Little stable mate pairing in the final round with Jason Day.  You played with Adam Scott back at the Masters.  
MARC LEISHMAN: It will be great, two guys in the stable.  Maybe don't get up too early.  It's really good to be playing with Jas.  Hopefully we can play some good golf and have something to cheer about and 50 percent with the birdies, like to continue that.
