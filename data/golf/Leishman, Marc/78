MARC LEISHMAN: Pretty good tee shot and I was over between 2-iron, 3-wood with the second shot.  So hit a hard 2-iron and it worked out pretty well for me.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARC LEISHMAN: I think it was 259 meters to the pin.  I think it was 230 front.  But there's a bunker 20 meters short of the green that you can carry, and if you carry it up you can get it up on the green.  So I was able to get that and give myself a good chance at eagle.
Q. Nice chatting along with Scott Hend?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it was good.  We had a good day.  He got off to a rough start the first couple of holes, but really got things going.  And I got off to a good start and then dropped off a little bit.  And then we both finished pretty well.  It's nice when you can play with a friend and both play well, especially in a big tournament like this.
Q. Urging each other on (inaudible.)
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, for sure.  I like to see him play well.  I think he has to have a good week this week to get into the PGA.  I want him to play well and get in there.  Generally when you play with someone who's playing well, you tend to feed off that and make a few birdies which was nice.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, just spin around the other way, that would be nice.  I was thinking that when I was adding them up at the end there, actually.  66.  I had a few chances I didn't take advantage of out there today.  But holed a couple of long putts that made up for that.  Hopefully I'll have a low one tomorrow and see where it ends up.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARC LEISHMAN: Yep, I did.  Yeah, I had one.  It's hard not to have a couple more, but I thought I better behave myself.  I didn't get the tee times until about 10:00 last night.  Wasn't sure if I was going to get off at 7:30 or 10:00 like I was.  I wanted to be fresh when I woke up.
Q. (Inaudible.)
