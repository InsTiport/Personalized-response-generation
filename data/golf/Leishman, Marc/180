 Q. You have to play a few times before you can make a good round?
 MARC LEISHMAN: I know. 

 Q. You played well today, but didn't hit a lot of greens. These greens are obviously in good shape?
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah. I was playing well off the green. 

 Q. Your last good outing was at Houston. Something about Texas?
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah. I don't know if it's the wind or the weather, but played well last year. It was windy. 

 Q. Did it play any different than yesterday, the course, with the wind?
 MARC LEISHMAN: With the wind? There was slice on the ball. It's maybe more forgiving than what we've been playing the last month or two, so it's good to get a good round. 

 Q. Is this a round you kind of saw coming, though? Has it been getting close?
 MARC LEISHMAN: It's close. Yeah. My coach was here on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 We worked on a couple of things. He was doing a good job. Hard working continues. 

 Q. Great start to your tournament. Good luck the rest of the week. 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Thanks a lot.
