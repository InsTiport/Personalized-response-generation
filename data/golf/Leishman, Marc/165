   JOHN BUSH: Marc Leishman joins us here in the interview room at the BMW Championship after a 6-under par 65. You finished second here last year to make it to the TOUR Championship and you're off to another great start through two rounds. Let's get your comments, please. 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Well, I got off to a really good start, birdied four of the first five holes, which was a good way to start the day, especially after the way I played yesterday. It was pretty ordinary yesterday, and my short game saved me. And then hit a lot of fairways and greens early on. It was great to be able to just take the stress off my short game for a little while.
 JOHN BUSH: Look back at last year for us, what you did here to get to Atlanta, how much that meant. 
 MARC LEISHMAN: That was huge. It got me into all the majors. For the first time in my pro career I could actually set a schedule, which I haven't ever been able to do. That made things a lot easier this year, not only being in all the big tournaments but knowing what I'm going to play in January instead of the week before. 
 Yeah, but getting through last year meant a lot. Looking back on it this week, I've got a lot to -- well, a lot of experience to draw on, so hopefully I can do the same thing again. 

 Q. Did you feel a sense of dÃ©jÃ -vu when you got here and you were kind of in the same spot as you were last year in terms of FedExCup? 
 MARC LEISHMAN: A little bit, yeah. I think I have to finished 4th this year instead of outright 3rd. It's easy this year. (Laughter.)
 No, but I've got some good memories here. You stand on a few greens and you remember what happened last year, and of course the way I played it Sunday. It's just cool to have that probably for the first time since I've been pro. I played Nationwide for a year and had a win on that Tour but didn't get a chance to go back the year after. Although I didn't win last year it sort of felt as if I did. When I was leaving the course, I sort of felt as if I had won. Yeah, definitely got some good memories.

 Q. You said a couple of weeks ago you were really looking forward to getting here because this is one of your favorite courses, maybe your favorite course that you play. A lot of the players have been really critical of the greens. They're obviously not where they need to be. But yet you still somehow managed to go 6-under. Is that because you feel so good here, or how did you overcome the greens? 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Well, I read the greens pretty well. They're some of my favorites. I mean, where the TOUR is putting the pins, they're not bad, where they're putting the pins. They're fine. There's a few patchy spots, but it's not as though you're putting on a road or anything. They're good greens. If you were to put these in front of a club golfer, they'd be like, these are good greens. 
 I don't know, when I hear other players making comments like that, which I've only heard through you guys, it sort of feels like you've got less players to beat because the guys that are complaining, they've already let it beat them, I think. I'm just putting on what we've been given. Everyone is playing on the same golf course, so that's the way I'm looking at it. Like I said, it's not as bad as what everyone is making it out I don't think. Every week we putt on perfect greens, and when they're not quite perfect, it's not the end of the world. 

 Q. How would they compare to where you grew up? They're still good greens would you say compared to places where you grew up?
 MARC LEISHMAN: They're better, definitely better. I grew up in the country, and they get mowed three times a week, the greens. They mow them before the club competition. 
 These are still good. You fix a few pitch marks here and there, and they're fine. If you hit a good putt, it's still going to go in. It's not going to bounce. You might get the occasional one that bounces that misses, but if you hit ten putts from five feet and hit good putts, you're going to hole nine and -- well, 95 percent of them I'd say. They're fine. I think they're fine. 
 JOHN BUSH: Take us through those first four birdies. No. 10.
 MARC LEISHMAN: 10, I hit a really good drive, landed about 100 yards from the pin in the middle of the fairway, hit the edge of a sprinkler head and bounced just off the front edge of the green, so that was a good way to get started. Just got up-and-down there, holed probably a five- or six-footer.
 Hit a really good drive down 11, hit a hybrid just into the left trap. Had a really easy bunker shot, hit it up there to about a foot.
 I think I lipped out on 12 for birdie, just ran it over the edge.
 And then good drive on 13, had about 100 yards, hit a lob wedge to about ten feet, holed that one.
 And then holed a really good putt on 14 for birdie. It was probably about 20 feet down the hill.
 JOHN BUSH: Bogey on 17? 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Bogeyed 17, hit a really bad second shot. Hit a good drive and was between clubs, tried to hit the soft wedge, get it bouncing up the green and mis-hit it a little bit, and it went onto the face of the front bunker. Yeah, so that was a bit disappointing.
 And three-putted 15, as well, for par. So I did leave a couple out there, but that happens. 
 1, hit 3-wood off the tee, good 3-wood and then had 9-iron in, hit it to about 15 feet, rolled that in.
 Bogey on 2, worst shot of the year for me, that one. It was like a thin 7-iron that would have looked like a shank to anyone that didn't hear the noise. It actually came off the club face, but it was a bad shot and hit the trees on the right and then chipped it up and two-putted. It actually wasn't that bad of a bogey considering how bad the shot was. It deserved about a 7. 
 6, the par-3, hit a 6-iron to about 10 or 15 feet, rolled that one in.
 7, hit driver, faded it around the lake and then only had, I think, 80 meters to the hole, bounced a lob wedge short of the slope, ran it up the slope and it stopped about four or five feet.
 And then on the last, I hit a really good drive and a good second shot, too, but had to hook it around the -- I was on the left side of the fairway and had to hook it around a tree. It landed exactly where I wanted it to be, but it must have hit the edge of a divot or something and it bounced backwards and to the right instead of forwards and chasing up onto the green, and then chipped it up to probably about eight feet and rolled that in, which was a really good way to finish.
 JOHN BUSH: Nice playing, and thanks for coming by.
