 Q.  Marc, how are you able to pull off that upset today?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Well, I mean, got off to a pretty rough start.  Two down after two.   
Just never give up.  I guess expect the unexpected.  Wasn't expecting to beat Jordan.  I knew I would have to play really well to have a chance.  I was able to do it.   
 Q.  You were 2-down after two.  Where did you get the belief at that point that you knew you could do it?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Like I said, you just never give up.  Match play is a funny game.  You can get on a run of birdies or you can get lucky and get a couple of holes given to you, which didn't really happen to either of us.   
Got one on the Par 5 on the back nine there.  Yeah, I mean, I know I can make birdies.  I like it when there is a lot of people around and a fair bit on the line.  It was an enjoyable day.  We both played pretty decent.  It was fun.
