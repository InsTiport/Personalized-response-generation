Q. Just didn't go your way today?
MARC LEISHMAN: No, it didn't.  We combined pretty well, really.  When one of us was out of the hole, the other one was in.  It wasn't our day.  But the team went really well.  Got ourselves back into it, so that's a good thing.
Q. Was there a pivotal moment there that you felt?
MARC LEISHMAN: Not really, I don't think.  Maybe on 9.  JD was sort of out of the hole and Bubba landed one on the rocks and ended up making par.  Maybe there, but you know, we fought it out and definitely didn't give it away.
Q. Did you feel like you were on top of your game today?
MARC LEISHMAN: I feel like I'm playing pretty well.  Hit a couple of shots that I would like to have over again, but on those holes, got to birdie them or par them.  So feeling good.  Game is feeling good.
