 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Happy with my position.  Drove the ball well again today.  My irons weren't quite where I would have liked, didn't give myself enough close birdie opportunities.  But yeah, obviously disappointing to finish off with a bogey on the last, but after that tee shot, probably deserved at least a bogey.   
 Q.  Is this where you need to be heading into Sunday?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, happy.  Feel like I've given myself a lot of chances on Sundays and the more you get your self into that position, the better your chances get.  So I feel like I'm playing really well, just need to get the putts to roll in and keep hitting fairways like I have been.   
 Q.  What have you learned from some of those Sundays that you can take into tomorrow?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Just be patient again.  Whenever you play well, I feel like that's what you say, but that's what you got to do out here.  You can, like today, bogey the 1st, and there is birdie opportunities out there if you're hitting good shots.  So, definitely stay patient, try and leave myself below the hole, so you can give those putts, knock them in a with a bit of speed, because it's tough when you're trying to dribble them in, they can just break off and miss very easily.   
 Q.  Did you hear that if you win this thing you don't get the blazer anymore, you get the red cardigan sweater like Mr. Palmer used to wear.  I know you're probably not thinking about such things, but.  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I hadn't heard that, but I'll gladly put on whatever it is, the red cardigan tomorrow, that would be nice.  I would like to certainly give myself a chance and it's obviously an honor to be here again and it's such a great event.
