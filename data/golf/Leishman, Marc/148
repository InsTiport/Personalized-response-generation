 Q.   Had a tough back nine, but you got off to a good start.   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I got off to a bright start.   It was a tough back nine with a couple of loose shots there, but managed to on these greens get them up‑and‑down and hit the ball well.  
   
 Q.   How was the golf course playing this afternoon?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   It was good.   The wind wasn't too strong.   It was switching around a little bit, so it was hard to work out where it was coming from.   But the greens are perfect and the course is in great condition.   I guess it will only firm up during the week so it will be good on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   When you came out today did you have expectations of what you wanted to shoot?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   I didn't have a number in mind.   I just wanted to not get ahead of myself.   Obviously, it wasn't playing too tough so under par was good.   But probably 2‑under or better was a good score out there, so I managed to do that and put myself in a good spot.
