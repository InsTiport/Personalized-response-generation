Q. The way it played out, you have to be pretty satisfied with the halve.  How did it feel going through the course of the match?
MARK LEISHMAN: It was an up-and-down match.  We got up early, a little bit down, back to square.  Looked like we were going to lose.  But you know, that's match play and you've got a little bit of pressure and you never know what might happen.
Q. The way things turned around, the chip shot you hit at 16 looked like you might lose the hole and you ends up winning the hole?
MARC LEISHMAN: Exactly.  Almost holed that one.  That was a terrible drive and I had to make that putt for Scotty there, for both of us.  I really wanted to putt him a bit closer than that.
Q. You have to be proud of the way you came through.
MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely, yeah.  Nice 10-footer to make it at the end to give ourselves a chance.  If I miss that, it's all over.
Like I said, you never know what can happen, and we got out of that one.
Q. You must feel proud that you contributed to keeping the momentum going?
MARK LEISHMAN: Definitely.  I lost my first two matches and really didn't play too bad.  But to lose my first three would have been very disappointing considering I'm not playing too bad.  But it's nice to contribute half a point.  That might be the difference at the end of the week.
