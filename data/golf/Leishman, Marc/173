   MARK STEVENS: We'd like to welcome Marc Leishman to the interview room. Marc shot a 68 today and is at 9-under for the tournament. If you'd start off and give us some general comments about your round and then we'll take a few questions. 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, played well early, solid, and holed a few putts for birdies. I didn't hole any real long ones, but they were all pretty close chances. Then holed a good par putt on 7, about seven feet, and then missed a couple of short ones on 8 and 9 for birdie. So fairly good front nine.
 And then hit one over there on 11, got fairly unlucky. Just landed on the edge of the bunker, spouted hard right and finished probably three or four inches out of bounds, so that made me happy (smiling). 
 And then fought back pretty well, made birdie with the second ball and then had a couple of -- one birdie coming in, I think. So it was, yeah, a pretty good day, I think. 

 Q. So it wasn't that bad a drive?
 MARC LEISHMAN: Well, it probably should have been in the fairway bunker, but it landed just over it, bounced hard right. The rough was all trampled, and it ran probably 30 yards right. Yeah, finished probably that far out of bounds. Yeah, pretty unlucky, but that's the way it goes. 
 Probably cost me -- probably only cost me a shot in the end, because I probably only would have been able to make par from where I was. It was one shot that I probably didn't want to give away, but it was not as bad as what it could have been.

 Q. One shot would have got you into the last group tomorrow with Tiger. Were you thinking about that, or were you looking forward to it? Would you have rather? I know you haven't played with him before and probably haven't met him, but would you have rather been in that last group tomorrow?
 MARC LEISHMAN: It would have been great to be playing with Tiger for the first time in the last group of a tournament, especially the third Playoff event. It would have been unbelievable. But I knew I had to hole that putt on the last to play with him. I obviously wanted it to go in, but it was -- that's life. 
 It might do me some good in the end, not having all that to deal with. But at the same time, it would have been awesome to play with him. 

 Q. The people in Warrnambool would have been staying up to watch TV. 
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it would have been something to telegram back home. That would have been nice. Hopefully it'll happen in the next few years. 

 Q. What did you do on the front nine so well that you weren't able to do on the back? 
 MARC LEISHMAN: I was hitting it on the fairway, and then I just was hitting my irons really well. It seemed that I had a perfect number on nearly every hole, whereas on the back nine it seemed like I was between clubs every hole, particularly 17. I probably ended up hitting the wrong club there, but it was right between. Either way I would have been struggling.
 I think, yeah, I holed the good ten-footers on the back nine. I missed a short one on 13. Yeah, just the putts and hitting the fairways. It's tough to hit it close from the rough. 

 Q. When you made the turn at I think you were 10-under, if someone would have said you can play the back nine in 1-over and you would be seven behind, would you have believed it?
 MARC LEISHMAN: Probably. That's Tiger. I mean, you wouldn't think so, but like I say, it's Tiger. Anything can happen. Well, anything good. You're not going to shoot 45 on a nine, I'm pretty sure of that. Yeah, it's an awesome player. He'll be tough to catch tomorrow. 
 MARK STEVENS: Thanks a lot, Marc. Good luck tomorrow.
