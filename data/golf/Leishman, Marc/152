  MARC LEISHMAN:   I played really well on the front nine and actually played reasonably well on the back, too, just got probably‑‑ well, I hit a bad shot on 12, hit it through the green, but the shot on 13 wasn't too bad.   And then obviously on 18, bogeying that.   But got pretty tough towards the end with that wind picking up.   A little bit disappointing the way I finished, but didn't do myself too much damage and still got a chance tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   The winds picked up but the greens were a little softer.   Were they easier to putt when you came back out after the suspension?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   I didn't find that.   I missed everything when I came back out.   We didn't have too much rain I don't think.   They may have been a little slower, but not too much.   They were still pretty dry.  
   
 Q.   Game plan for tomorrow?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Same as what I've been doing.   I feel like I'm playing pretty good, just need to hole a few more putts and see what happens.   If I can shoot 6‑ or 7‑under, who knows.
