 Q.  Obviously a tough match.  How would you describe your emotions?  
JASON DAY: I mean, it was just an up-and-down day between not only me and Marc, but obviously Phil and Kiz.  They were up early, 3-up, and then we got it back to 1-up for us, and it was kind of going back and forth.  Obviously the halve, it's better than obviously the outcome where Phil could have had that putt to win.   
But Marc played some good golf today.  He putted spectacular, and obviously it's tough.  The wind was really, really difficult.  It happens.  So you know, hopefully we just kind of pick ourselves up and get it going tomorrow.   
 Q.  How would you describe how intense that match was?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Very.  That's about as intense as it gets.  You have all your teammates there and all the American guys, and the match is on the line.  So you know, it's obviously disappointing, but like Jason said --   
JASON DAY: A halve point is better than none.   
 Q.  Would you say a fair result, a halve?  
JASON DAY: After seeing the flag with the match on the last hole -- obviously it was back and forth the whole day.  They were up early, up three pretty quick and wasn't looking too good for us, and Leish had an amazing chip-in on 9 and that kind of got us going a little bit.   
Being able to do that, and getting back to the lead; I mine, obviously it's not what we wanted but half a point is always better than no points.   
 Q.  With the wind happening, you guys happy with that?  
MARC LEISHMAN: It was nice.  I enjoy playing in the wind.  Like Jason said, it was a disappointing result but could have been worse.  Take the positives out of it.
