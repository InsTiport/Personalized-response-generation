Q. Just a quick assessment of the match.  How did it go for you guys?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, we obviously didn't play as well as we would have liked.  But we got off to a bad start losing the first two holes, to be down to as good of players as Jordan and Dustin was hard.  They gave us some chances and we just couldn't take them.  We hit some bad shots when they gave us chances and, unfortunately, that probably cost us.
But like I said, we were behind the eight ball straight off the bat.  Started to get a little momentum there I think after we got back to 1-down on 9, and then from then on.
Q. Two shots in the water on one hole, right?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, on 11, we were in a bad spot.  Yeah, that was a key hole.  That was costly.
Q. How do you guys pick yourself up from here?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it's only one session down.  Only five points have been decided.  There are still 25 to be decided.  So if we can play good, there is no reason we can't come back from this.  We could be level after tomorrow night, who knows.
But I think four-ball is going to be a better game for us.  A few rookies, a few guys who are forcing stuff, maybe a little nervous.  But it's just not our day I guess.
