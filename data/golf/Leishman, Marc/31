Q. Really good play today.  How are you feeling?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, playing well.  I drove it a lot better today, which was nice.  I got off to a pretty hot start with I'm not sure how many birdies I had in the first seven holes, but it was probably four, five, I can't remember.  But that always helps in match play to get off to a good start and then you can play a little bit more conservative.  But someone who is as good a player as Bryson, I knew I had to keep the foot down and make him earn holes when he won them.  So, yeah, it was a good day.  Playing well, looking forward to hopefully the next two days.
Q. Getting better and better as this thing goes along?
MARC LEISHMAN: I hope so.  So far that's been the case.  Played okay on Wednesday, pretty disappointing on the par-3s, losing all of them.  So I fixed that up.  And a few loose tee shots early in the week, which I've improved that, as well.  So hopefully can keep trending in the right direction and make it all the way through.
Q. Did you watch the scoreboard?
MARC LEISHMAN: I didn't look at what any other matches were doing, but, yeah, always like to know the score.
Q. What was your best shot today?
MARC LEISHMAN: What was my best shot?  Probably my putt on the third.  Holed like a 25-footer.  That was to go 3-up through 3.  Bryson was in for par.  And that kind of stamped my authority pretty early on.  Yeah, and then a really good bunker shot on 5 from the front bunker.  It was a pretty tricky one, which could have came back down the slope, if I didn't hit it far enough.  Probably a 30-yard bunker shot.  Those two stand out.  But hit quite a lot of quality shots and didn't make too many stupid mistakes.
Q. Thoughts on your match tomorrow against Louis?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, Louis is a great player.  Everyone who's playing tomorrow is obviously a good player that's playing well.  I'll have to keep doing what I've been doing, try and make a lot of birdies.  He'll have to do the same.
So yeah, good friend of mine, I'm sure we'll have fun out there but it will be pretty competitive.
