Q. Is this the Australian attack on Bay Hill this week between you and Jason Day and also the lurking Adam Scott?
MARC LEISHMAN: Hopefully it will be.  Sunday afternoon.  Hopefully we're all there, still.  Yeah, I would say the Aussies are doing pretty well this week and it's nice to have all of us up there.
Q. What was working for you out there today?
MARC LEISHMAN: Drove the ball pretty well.  Still hit my irons well but hit -- wasn't as stress-free as yesterday.  Few loose shots.  You know, had quite a few good up and downs and kept the momentum going.
Q. Could you still score on the course, I guess?
MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely.  I feel like the greens were not quite as firm as yesterday, maybe a little bit slower although put a bit of water on them overnight or something.  So, it was definitely getable.  Obviously great score of Jason, 7-under.  You know, you still got to shoot the score.  So yeah, you know, it's not easy by any means.
