 Q.   I know it wasn't the finish that you necessarily wanted, but you got front and center for something pretty special therewith Adam?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, that was awesome to be able to do that.   Hopefully it will work out for the best.   Obviously it didn't work out the way I wanted it to today, but I also had a great tournament and it's something to build on for the rest of the year for sure.   
   
 Q.   What will you take away then specifically from this Masters that maybe you can take to your next Major?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Well, I know I can put it together for four rounds, probably a lot of guys didn't expect me to do what I did, and to do that was great.   
I didn't finish off the way I would have liked, but I have a lot of positives to take away from it.   
   
 Q.   It was a good tournament for Australians?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   It was.   Hopefully it's going to be a great tournament for Australians.   I hope that Scotty can pull it off in the playoff, but yeah, I'm not sure what exactly Jason finished on, but hopefully he's going to be in the topâ€‘5, which is pretty good odds.   And hopefully it will be all us of us standing around with Scotty wearing the Green Jacket.   
   
 Q.   Your little boy is really happy.   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, he's really happy.   It's great to have him here, he's 8 months old now and to have him here it makes life a lot better.
