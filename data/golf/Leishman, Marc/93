 Q.  66 pretty good finish.  Take us through how you feel about your game for the week.  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, happy with the way I played.  Probably yesterday would have liked to have a few shots back.  Feel like I threw a few shots away, but for not having picked up a club for a month, not having my clubs till Wednesday night and not getting a practice round or anything, it was a pretty good week.   
 Q.  Is there a number that you had?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Not really.  I was just too far back.  I wanted to go have the best score I could and try and maybe sneak into the top 5, which is looks like I might do, maybe not.   
Yeah, wasn't really thinking about winning.  I wanted to go low but when you start being too aggressive, that's when things can go the other way.   
 Q.  Is this the kind of round that gives you momentum going forward?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, for sure.  First alternate for HSBC next week, so hopefully I can sneak in there and play out there and have another good week.  If not, I'll go home and see what we'll do after that.  I'll probably play the next week I think.
