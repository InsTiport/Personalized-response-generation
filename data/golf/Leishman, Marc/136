 Q.   Finishing 13‑under today, how do you feel about your overall play?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I feel really good.   I'd be disappointed about the way I started this morning, being 2‑over after four holes, but that's golf, and to fight back the way I did was pretty pleasing.  
   
 Q.   Any highlights, long putts?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   The four birdies in a row from 7 to 11, the birdie putt on 7 really turned things around for me.   Things weren't going so well up until then, and that really got the ball rolling.  
   
 Q.   Rain yesterday, how was the weather today?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   The weather was perfect.   No wind, which is different for Waialae.   Normally it's really windy here.   It was nice to play it without wind.   A little bit weird, actually.   But it was good.   It was perfect.
