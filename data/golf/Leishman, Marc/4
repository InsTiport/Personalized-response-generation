  Q. Did you get everything you wanted to out of that round today?
 MARC LEISHMAN:   I think the second half of the round I did.  Early on, I hit the ball great all day but couldn't make the putts, burning edges.  I knew they would drop eventually because I was hitting good putts, and they were very close to going in and they went in towards the end of the round.
 Q. What's your mentality that you bring out tomorrow?  Might be a little bit more wind but still a bunched leaderboard.
 MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, a really bunched leaderboard, four back it looks like.  Going to have to go low.  Can't see Steeley shooting -- well, I'll have to shoot 65 or less to have any sort of chance.  Go out and attack and try to make all the putts where I give myself an opportunity and see where it leaves us.
