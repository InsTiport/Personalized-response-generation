  Q. A chip and a chair.  You've given yourself a hope now tomorrow.
 MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, exactly.  Tied for the lead, I suppose.  I need to win tomorrow.  Certainly I haven't had my best stuff over the last couple days, but some good shots there coming in, nice to get a win and, yeah, like I say, got a chance, just need to play good.
 Q. You showed some resilience there when you had some shots didn't go your way but you were able to at the end of the day in the moment and not beat yourself up too much?
 MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, there's some hard shots.  That tee shot on 11 was tough today.  I hit a horrendous shot.  I probably won't be the only one who hits it in the water there.  So yes, I was, had a bit of a talking to myself there on the 13th tee, felt, you know, pretty flat, and I was still square, still tied or whatever they call it now.  So a bit of a kick in the ass, I suppose, to myself and it worked.
 Q. Obviously you played Sungjae, a Presidents Cup teammate of yours.  How was that?  You guys have a decent relationship, etcetera?
 MARC LEISHMAN:   It was good, yeah, we have a good relationship.  Obviously it's not a whole lot of talking.  But it was a competitive match, a friendly match, as was the match yesterday as well with Victor, so sure to be more of the same tomorrow, hopefully I can bring some better golf and come out with a win.
