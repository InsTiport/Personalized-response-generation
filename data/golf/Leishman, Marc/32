Q. Moving into the round of 16.  Tell me about your match.
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I felt like I played pretty well all week.  Got off to a really hot start today.  Birdie on 1 and 3, 5 and 6, had a few birdies, so it was nice to get off to a start like that.  And gives me confidence going into the weekend.  But the opponents are only going to get tougher.
Q. You have Louis Oosthuizen here now in Round 4.  Louis has played really well after that opening match.  He's 16 under par in his last two rounds, and he only played 14 or 15 holes today?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, Louis is a great player.  So it's going to be a tough match.  I said before this week, everyone here is a good player.  Obviously the guys that made the weekend are playing well.  I'll have to have my best stuff to beat him.  But hopefully I can keep doing what I've been doing and give him a run.
Q. Any feelings on playing a Presidents Cup teammate?
MARC LEISHMAN: Not really.  I mean, you just have to play who with you're put up against.  It's just you get what you're given.
