  MARC LEISHMAN: I am hitting it a bit closer to the hole.  It's easier when you're holing 10- to 15-footers for birdie instead of trying to hole 20- or 30-footers.  It was a lot better day.Q. Talk about the round and talk about finishing in this place.MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I'm really happy.  It's a tournament I haven't done well at in the past.  I love this style of golf.  I love links golf.  But for some reason just hadn't played any good. So to get something down here, especially today, it was a solid week before today, but today made it a really good week.  Wherever it finishes, whether it's 3rd or 5th or 8th, who knows, it's a good week for me.Q. (Inaudible.)MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I had I think two or three birdies in a row on maybe 4, 5, 6.  That was a really good way to get things moving after parring the first three.  And then bouncing back with a birdie on 10 after bogeying 9 kept the momentum going. Just a solid day.  I hit the ball well.Q. What's this going to do to your year and the year from the year on?MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, hopefully it sends it upwards.  I'd like it to.  It's hard to say at the moment.  It gives me confidence for the rest of this year and coming back to British Opens in the future, knowing that if I play good, I have a chance to contend.Q. Can you now visualize winning one?MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, definitely.  I love the tougher golf courses and the majors are generally played on tough golf courses.  I came close to the Masters a couple of years ago.  Played with Scotty, who won.  And it was great to see exactly what you have to do.  And then today to -- well, I was too far back at the start of the day, but to at least have a run at it, and if I did something stupid I could have maybe given him a run for his money.  But it does give me confidence going forward in the majors.Q. Things have seemed to come together the last year or two?MARC LEISHMAN: I think experience is a big thing.  I'm hitting the ball better.  I'm maturing as a golfer and mentally I'm a lot better than I was.  Probably this was one of the best weeks mentally I've had.  I just didn't let anything bother me and that's probably been the problem in the past.  But this week it was the best it's been.  I guess I should do that all the time.  That's easy to say that.  The results sort of speak for themselves.Q. Is that a concentration thing?MARC LEISHMAN: Frustration more than anything.  Not talking about breaking clubs or anything like that, but I'm pretty hard on myself.  So I try to not do that this week and it worked pretty well.
