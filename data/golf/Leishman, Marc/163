 Q.   Mark on an afternoon when a nice, quiet round is probably a good thing, just two birdies, just one bogey, you got it around.   
MARK LEISHMAN:   It was a good day, I didn't hit it as well as I did yesterday, except that last hole, which was pretty easy.   It was a good stretch.   Also playing in a bit of wind out there.   
   
 Q.   We like it windy here, and you have played so well here with the wind.   
MARK LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I like the wind, and it's good that the greens are firm and they are what I grew up on.   It's been a good place for me and hopefully it will be even better this weekend.   
   
 Q.   I think the first time most of us met you was when in '09 when you finished topâ€‘ten here, you were near the lead all week, and you played here well the next year, '10.   What is it about this course that feels so good to you?   
MARK LEISHMAN:   I don't know.   I like the greens.   I do well on them, and that doesn't happen everywhere for you.   
It's nice to hit it where you think you should and that's where it goes, then you putt well and it goes in.   But I've played well here, enjoy the challenge, enjoy the tough conditions.   
   
 Q.   You got in on a bit of cricket earlier this week.   
MARK LEISHMAN:   I did.   I played on Tuesday night, we got through injury free, and it was a lot of fun to relax before the long week.   
   
 Q.   Take your mind off the game, and now you get to grind for the weekend.   You feel good where you are?   
MARK LEISHMAN:   I do, yeah.   I've been playing well, the results haven't been that great but looking forward to playing well here and trying to finish it off.   
   
 Q.   Good luck to you, thanks.   
MARK LEISHMAN:   No worries.
