  MARC LEISHMAN:   I don't know if I played as well as yesterday but I scored better.   It's never a bad thing when you can sort of scrape it around for a couple under.

Q.   When you had good looks‑‑ you got the one on 8 and a couple other.   Most of them, though, you were just putting away really clever pars. 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I hit a lot of good shots and hit a few ordinary shots, but like I said, the misses were in the right spots.   If I can keep doing that the next couple of days it would be good and try and hole a few more birdie putts.

Q.   You've been in the mix of a few tournaments before.   Does it feel any different now?   You're obviously a better golfer now. 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I'm a better golfer now, definitely.   I haven't done anything since Bay Hill last year, but I like this course, the game feels good.   This week not so much but the last couple of weeks I've been making a lot of bogeys instead of birdies, so hopefully I can roll a few putts in.   I think I've got the speed down now, so I'm ready to go.

Q.   You mentioned there's a handful of courses you like on TOUR.   Is this one of those?
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yep.

Q.   Is there any reason why that is?
MARC LEISHMAN:   Some courses out here I like more than others.   I grew up on poa, so that's good.   It's familiar.   So you know, just tee to green, they go as I see them.   On Bermuda or in Phoenix, for example, you've just got to read grain into it or whatever it is, but here I see it and pretty much know where it's going to go.   That's a good feeling when you're standing over a five‑footer and you know where it's going to go.
