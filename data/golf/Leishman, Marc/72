Q. With a third-place finish, and a blistering start, 30 on the front nine, and then the back nine, five bogeys.  What changed?
MARC LEISHMAN: You know, a bad tee shot on 10, and then just went downhill from there unfortunately.  Had it going on the front.
You know, the back nine is a lot tougher nine but it's not ten shots tougher.  Very disappointed.  But you know, third, it could be a lot worse.
Q. And the good news is with that third-place finish you move from 13th to seventh in the FedExCup standings.  So what do you carry with you and the momentum into the third and fourth Playoff events?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I didn't think I would get that high to be honest.  Happy with that, yeah.  Hopefully a good week at the BMW and who knows what can happen at THE TOUR Championship.
Yeah, take the positives out of this week.  Obviously, you know, got a few things to work on.  You know, looking forward to getting back into contention again and trying to give it another go.
