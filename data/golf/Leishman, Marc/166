  Q. Were you looking at the leaderboard?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: I saw what was happening and knew I was a couple behind. Eagle on 16, good up and down. And while a birdie off the tee on 18, par off the tee shot. Yeah, I was checking it out.   
  
  Q. Obviously you have to feel good about the week overall regardless of what happens. Just talk a little about your week?   
 MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely. The first couple of days were good without being great. Had a few too many double-bogeys, but yeah, obviously played really well yesterday and good today.   
 Just had a bit of a slip up in the middle there with a double and bogeying last, but that's a pretty tough hole today. But it's been a good week no matter what happens.   
  
  Q. Are you playing next week in Houston?   
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I'll be playing Houston and then hopefully Augusta, depending on what happens today and next week obviously.   
 Hopefully I can do something special today or next week.   
  
  Q. So overall, you're confident, you take a good feel away; the tournament's not over, but overall, you feel good about where you are?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: Definitely, yeah. I've been playing pretty well without the results, and then obviously second or third or whatever happens here today, it's not every week you're in with a chance to win or finishing top two or three I guess. Pretty confident for next week.
