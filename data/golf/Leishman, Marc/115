Q.   I know you made some mistakes, but when you made those, you bounced right back with birdies.   Good solid finish out there. 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Thank you.   I made some mistakes that probably deserve worse than bogeys, to be honest.   The two bogeys‑‑ the two that I made were actually really good bogeys, could have been a lot worse. 
Made a lot of birdies, again.   So, yeah, you know, disappointed not to win, but when Rory is playing the way he is, he's tough to beat.   I'll take third.

Q.   How was the golf course after the rain we had this morning? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   It was soft.   It was a lot softer, especially the greens.   Greens were still yesterday not spinning too much.   Today they were spinning a lot.   When you had a wedge in your hand, you really had to take that into account and try to take the spin off it. 
It changed things a little bit, but the course was in perfect condition.   Couldn't ask for it to be in better condition.   It's just a great golf course. 

Q.   What does your finish here do for your confidence headed into next week? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Can't hurt it.   I'm feeling pretty good about my game at the moment.   Probably didn't drive it quite the way I wanted to today.   Sort that out early next week, hopefully. 
But I'm feeling great about my game and looking forward to getting to Valhalla.   Hopefully, getting in the hunt again.
