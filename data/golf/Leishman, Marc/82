Q. Strange situation coming here for a playoff.  Happy to get through?
MARC LEISHMAN: Very happy.  It was strange this morning not even knowing if I was going on the playing.  Even three hours ago I didn't know if I was going to be playing.  Now I'm going to be playing tomorrow.  It was a nice surprise.  Not a surprise, but Lee's a great player.  A lot had to go my way to even get a chance today.  I'm just happy to have a chance and take advantage of it.
Q. Did you take it as normal as you possibly could?
MARC LEISHMAN: I warmed up exactly how I have the first couple of days.  Did my normal routine, lunch, stretch, hit balls.  Just hoping to only play one hole.  I managed to end up having to play two.  Walking out of here happy today which was the goal, to not be moping off to the car, which has happened here last year.  I wanted to be happy walking to the car.
Q. Talk about your match tomorrow.
MARC LEISHMAN: Phil is a great player.  Tough competitor.  It's going to be a hard match.  Hopefully I can continue my form, keep playing well, see how we end up.
