Q. Dare I ask what the feeling is?
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, gutted. We had it right there, and you know, the Americans, they turned up today. They played great. I mean, I don't think we did too much wrong. They are a great team and they proved that today.
Yeah, very disappointed. I mean, really disappointed. A team like that, you know that they are going to bring the fight, and they did. Yeah, we couldn't quite get over the line. I mean, they putted great.
I wasn't surprised. That's what they do in these things. Yeah, that's how these have gone, unfortunately, the last few years, and I thought this might have been the year that we changed it, but wasn't to be. I think that we'll bring confidence to the next one on their home turf.
Q. Than losing from an individual event, it's a different feeling; is this course?
MARC LEISHMAN: Oh, for sure. Yeah, it is. There's 156 guys in a tournament, and one wins. There's 155 losers every week. Obviously some are easier to take than others.
But this one, there's 12 winner this is week, and unfortunately, the Internationals weren't on the good side of it. But we'll work hard, try and bring it to them next time.
