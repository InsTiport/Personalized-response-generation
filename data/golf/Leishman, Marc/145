  MARC LEISHMAN:   Didn't play quite as good as I did yesterday.   But shot even par, so if I can do some damage on the weekend and make a few birdies, who knows what might happen.

Q.   What was the biggest challenge for you today during this round?
MARC LEISHMAN:   Biggest challenge?   Recovering from bad shots.   I hit a few pretty ornery shots and left myself in bad positions or missed it in places you can't miss it. 
I mean you can get away with it on some holes around here, but the holes I did it I couldn't.   So that was probably the biggest challenge.   But I'm playing all right.   If that can be my bad round for the week, should be in a good spot.
