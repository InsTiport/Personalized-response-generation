Q. How was it out there?
MARC LEISHMAN: I find playing in the rain pretty difficult.  Actually, well, I won't say happy, but I'm certainly not disappointed with a 1-over.  I was saying to Matty out there, some people, rain doesn't affect them.  Some people wind does.  I love the wind and not a huge fan of the rain.  So to get through that kind of -- I won't say unscathed, but with a respectable score, just to give me a chance over the next couple of days, I was happy with that.
Q. You'll be happy if it's windier?
MARC LEISHMAN: Well, I'm just hoping that it dries out.  I've done it before from a long way back.  I think at the moment I'm 7 back.  Who knows where I'll end up.  But you can do that with a good 12 holes.  You get hot for a while, and you can make that up.  So hopefully, that's what I'll do.  But it's still two rounds left.  Striking the ball well.  But optimistic, put it that way.
