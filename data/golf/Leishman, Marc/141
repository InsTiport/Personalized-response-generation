 Q.   First Presidents Cup experience out of the way, talk about that a little bit?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah it was a good experience.   Obviously big crowds, and you know, cheering for the Americans, it was a little bit different, but I didn't play too bad.   I think I had four birdies and Tiger and Kuch played really well.   Made a lot of birdies and they combined really well, when one guy was out of the hole, the other was making birdie.   So that's what you have to do to win matches.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your nerves on the first tee, was it nervous, or not too bad?  
MARC LEISHMAN:     I was pretty nervous.   But I handled them okay.   Hit the fairway which was a good thing.   But you know, I haven't been that nervous for a fair while.   You know, first match, hopefully get that out of the way and won't be as bad tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Nice to know that you'll go right back out tomorrow, guaranteed to play?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, for sure.   Looking forward to getting more points for the Internationals.
