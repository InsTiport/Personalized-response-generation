 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, definitely.   The greens were pretty firm at the end there.       
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, they've got more good memories to draw on.   Just nice to have those memories and be playing well, too.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Put a nice 1‑up on the green to five feet or whatever it was.  
I actually didn't hit any bad shots, to be honest with you.   The wind was into us on 5.   And I hit a good shot and it blew it to the right, into a spot where you can't hit it.   I knew I had a few birdie holes coming up.  
And then the back nine, a couple of par‑5s, mentally I'm getting better because that stuff doesn't bother me as much as I used to.   It's good to not get really hostile when you're battling in a tournament, which I used to do.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN:   I was leading after one round last year, and wasn't after four.   I'd rather be leading after four this year.   I felt a bit of pressure last year.   Obviously leading you don't want to do anything stupid.   I don't want to do anything stupid tomorrow.   I'm moving forward.
