 Q. (No microphone.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: A bit of rain and, yeah, it's hard to make putts on hilly greens when you don't have the right speed. I hit a lot of good putts, just weren't going in, wasn't my day. So hopefully I can have a good one tomorrow. Still feel really good over the ball, feel really good over the putter, felt like I was going to make them, it was just the putter today. Try to get a few back tomorrow.   
   
 Q. What goes through your mind when Patrick is playing like that? Do you just concentrate on what you're doing, just try and get your self going or does it rock your confidence at all?   
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it's just, concentrate on what I'm doing, really. Around here if you start pushing too much you can, those pars become bogeys and things can go south pretty quickly. So, yeah, I was just worried about what I was doing, trying to get a birdie and couldn't do it. So it was pretty disappointing to not make a birdie, but I also only had one bogey, so I'm a long way back, but with a really low round tomorrow you never know what might happen.   
   
 Q. How about the roars all over the course, did you know a lot of guys were going low? Could you sense that?   
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I always look at the board, so I knew what ‑‑ there was no wind, there was birdies out there and I had a lot of chances to make birdies but just didn't take them. So, yeah, you know, it's hard when they're not dropping, but you have days like that and we'll be back tomorrow to do it all again.   
   
 Q. Are you looking forward to some of that Masters Sunday drama that's been famous every year?   
MARC LEISHMAN: I hope so, yeah. It would be nice to get off to a start like I did on Friday and just keep it going. Play the par‑5s really well‑‑ I didn't birdie any of them today, didn't birdie any par‑5s‑‑ but hopefully I can do some damage on the par‑5s tomorrow. Just give myself a lot of chances. I feel great over the putter, so I feel like I'm going to make putts, just got to do it.   
   
 Q. 17 you hit such a great shot in there, was that kind of the story of your day when it slid by on that putt?   
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it was. Actually, I thought that was in. That was‑‑ I actually misread that one a little bit, it needed a little bit more speed, just broke a little bit right at the hole. So, yeah, that was pretty much the story of the day. So I hit it well enough to shoot a really good score, but just wasn't to be.
