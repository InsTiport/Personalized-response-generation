Q.   Great round. 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, hopefully I'll either hole out or get up and down for bogey.   Yeah, it was a good day.   My expectations were pretty much non‑existent this week.   I've played golf three times in a month and two of them were nine holes with no warm‑ups.   So, yeah, I'm happy to come out and play like that, especially after the way I played yesterday.   I was terrible.   Probably more like what I was expecting, to be honest.   But, no, it was a good day.   And hopefully finish and have a good, solid weekend.

Q.   Are you aware that, if you hole out, it will tie the course record of 62? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   No, I didn't know that.   Hopefully, I can do that.   We'll see what I can do, I suppose.   We'll be on fresh greens in the morning, and hopefully roll it in and get it going tomorrow.

Q.   74 yesterday, potential 62 today.   What is the big difference? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Just getting a bit of practice in really.   I've played 36 holes in a month, so everything that's been happening, so it's just good to be back out here.   Yesterday I knocked the cobwebs off, and today I hit some good shots and holed some putts, and suddenly 10‑under.   So it's a good day.
