MARC LEISHMAN: Had two good shots into 17, a good putt.  Tried to give myself a chance of holing it.  Yeah, happy with the day.  Hit a lot of good shots, holed some good putts.  And considering I made the cut on the number it was -- turned into a good week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, exactly.  You can't throw in a 6-over par round and expect to contend in a major.  Didn't have my best stuff on Friday, unfortunately.  But made the cut and will have a top 10.  To turn an average week, what could have been a bad week, missing the cut, into a top 10, I'm happy.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, for sure.  I've got a week off and the Bridgestone, which feels like a major, and the PGA.  So good schedule coming up.  Playoffs coming up.  So there's a lot of golf to play on some really good courses, strong courses.  So hopefully I can play well at the PGA and contend there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, it feels like it's getting closer all the time.  There other things with majors, there's only four a year, so you have to try and peak at the right times.  Obviously you want to be playing well all year, but that's probably the next step, try and work on that to try and play really well in the middle of the year when the majors are.  But having said that, I'd rather just -- I'm happy doing what I'm doing now, playing well, contending in a lot of events throughout the year and still playing well here.  Take that 76 out Friday and it could be a different story.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: It's great.  You grow up watching all this stuff on TV.  And you hope you're going to get there one day.  And to be there on a Sunday afternoon when the stands are full, getting that ovation coming up the 18th hole, it feels really nice.  Occasionally you have to pinch yourself a little bit.  But I've done it a few times now, so it's just fun to do it.  And it would be nice to walk up there one day with a four-shot lead and enjoy it more.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: It's fun seeing all that stuff.  Between shots generally me and Matty, we don't talk about anything to do with golf, really.  It's always something else.  So having that to entertain us, it's really cool.  It's easy to take your mind off golf when you play with someone like Tommy.  He's a really, really nice guy.  So is his caddie.  So it was good -- could have played better and got the crowd really, really rowdy.  But it was still a good tournament for him.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I was leaning on them but I wasn't completely on top of them, so I had to drop it into the right.  I guess people had been standing on it and it had left a little trough, I guess, so I had to put it in.  If it's completely on top of the cables, I can drop it and probably get myself in a better lie.  But I wouldn't say unlucky.  It would have been nice to drop it and get it on a nicer lie, and give myself a chance of birdie instead of fighting for par there.  But it was a bad drive, so I deserved to be in a bit of trouble really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MARC LEISHMAN: A week off, then the Bridgestone, then the PGA, then another week off and then the playoffs.  Plenty of golf coming up.  Big tournaments.  Tournaments I like the courses and looking forward to it.
