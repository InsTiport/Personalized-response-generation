  Q. 4-under 68, lurking near the leaders this whole round. Your thoughts on today?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I was lurking around there but lurking around a bit late. I didn't hole putts early on and started rolling them in at the end. Yeah, good week.   
  
  Q. I was going to say, you're coming off being the Rookie of the Year. You were the only rookie last year that made it to the TOUR Championship series. Sometimes that second year is a little bit tougher, but tied for 20th at the Sony and you're playing well.   
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, I knew that just because I got Rookie of the Year it didn't mean I was all of a sudden going to become an unbelievable player. I knew I still had work to be done. I really didn't take that for granted and I'm not taking the PGA TOUR for granted.   
  
  Q. What's going well for you right now? What do you still have to work on?   
 MARC LEISHMAN: I could improve everywhere, definitely improvement to be done on the greens and around the greens. I drove the ball well the first three days, didn't drive it so great today.   
  
  Q. Robert had it going, too, today, had a chance to tie for the lead with an eagle putt that kind of got away from him there.   
 MARC LEISHMAN: He did, yeah. I played very well early on and a couple things happened toward the end of the round, but no, he played good and finished with an eagle on the last. That was great.
