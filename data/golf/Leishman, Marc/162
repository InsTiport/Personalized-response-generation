 Q.   (Away from mic.)   You know you didn't need any help after that.   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Exactly, and I had a couple of good chances on 11 and 12, which I just left short in the middle.   No, it was a good day.   
Anytime I can have a crack at a win on Sunday, it's a lot of fun, and hopefully I can do it again soon.   
   
 Q.   This will be your third topâ€‘12 here.   You would just as soon they start the TOUR here and you would get off to a great start for the season!   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I know, right?   Hopefully years down the track it will be better for me.   
   
 Q.   What's next for you down the road?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Colonial, and then hopefully I'll get into Memorial.   Then probably a week off before the U.S. Open.   
   
 Q.   Great playing this week, good luck.   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Thank you.
