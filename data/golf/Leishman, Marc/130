 Q.   How are you feeling headed into tomorrow?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   I'm feeling really good.   It's nice to get into this position two weeks in a row.   I felt like I learned a lot last week and looking forward to tomorrow.   I hit the ball well.   Got off to‑‑ obviously, bogeyed the first hole, which is not what you want to do at all around here.   It's probably the most birdied hole on the course and disappointing to bogey it.   But got things into gear after that and got it back on track pretty quickly.  
   
 Q.   Leaders are sitting at 8 right now.   So as it stands that the point you're two shots off.   If the conditions are similar tomorrow from what they are today, what do you think you have to shoot score‑wise?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Oh, I'm thinking you have to get to double figures minimum, and then I guess assess it from there.   If the wind gets up or, you know, you never know how everyone else is feeling.   Having said that, you never know.   Golf is a funny game.  
   
 Q.   The greens still seem receptive even though it's fairly late in the day?  
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, the greens are ery receptive.   They're really smooth and quite soft.   It's perfect weather for scoring.   Fairways are getting reasonably tough to hit.   They're really firming up.   The greens, if you're in the fairway, you've got a pretty good shot at birdie.  
   
 Q.   20 of the top 50 playing here this week.   What is it about this sport that guys like?   
MARC LEISHMAN:   Oh, it's just a good, old‑school course, I think.   It's not super long.   It's not long at all, and we don't play that many courses like that anymore.   So I think that's a good thing.   There is a lot of history here, obviously, with Ben Hogan and everything he's done.   It's a fun golf course, only two par 5s, but it feels like it's a lot of fun to play.
