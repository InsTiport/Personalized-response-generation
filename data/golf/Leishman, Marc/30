 Q.  Tell me about your round.  
MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, got off to a pretty ordinary start.  A couple over after three holes.  I didn't do a whole lot wrong, but knew if I kept doing -- hitting good shots, they've got to come eventually.  The course was out there to be had and it was nice to fight back and shoot a couple under.   
 Q.  Talk about the setup today versus even the practice rounds so far?  
MARC LEISHMAN: Greens were a little quicker today but still pretty soft.  I think that's going to change a lot as the week goes on, certainly.  I wouldn't expect a whole lot of 5-, 6, 7-unders on the weekend.  I think it will firm up a lot and be really difficult.   
 Q.  How about the fairways, based upon now you're in competition, did they feel tighter than normal?  
MARC LEISHMAN: No, not really.  I think there are some fairways that are quite generous, like 9, 10, 13.  And there is a few narrow ones.  8 is pretty narrow.  11 is very narrow.  So there's a good mixture.  I think they've done a good job of it so far.  It's primed to be pretty good for the weekend.   
 Q.  So what's your preparation for tomorrow after what you've done today?  Do you change anything or stick with what your game plan is?  
MARC LEISHMAN: No, all the same.  Just have a relaxing afternoon, probably watch a little bit of golf on TV and just take it easy.
