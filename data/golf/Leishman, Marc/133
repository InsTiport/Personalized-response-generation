Q.   Tough way to lose a match, 22 holes.   Just kind of go through the day and how you played, how Sergio played. 
MARC LEISHMAN:   We both played pretty well.   I think we made our first bogey‑‑ I think Sergio made a bogey on the 15th and that was the first one for the match. 
We both played pretty well.   We both had our chances.   I couldn't make most of mine and he birdied the 22nd hole.   So he's better on the day.

Q.   In terms of a match like this, would you rather play well and‑‑ you lost the match in 22 holes versus losing like 5 and 4 and getting out of here early.   You feel like you played well enough to win, just kind of went up against a guy that ‑‑
MARC LEISHMAN:   I definitely played well enough win.   It's disappointing either way.   I guess you'd rather make a good match of it. 
I guess in hindsight, it would have been better to lose 10 and 8 and be home at 10 o'clock this morning.   No, I would rather make a good match of it and play good golf.

Q.   Is in the second time you've played this event?
MARC LEISHMAN:   First time.

Q.   How much more difficult was it to learn the course?   You've got a short week, a lot of undulations on the greens, a lot of places where you've got to know where to hit it off the tee.   How much preparation did you do? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   I played 18 on Monday and then nine Tuesday.   Felt like my preparation was good, knew the course reasonably well, as well as you can in two days. 
You know, just hit it in a couple of bad spots late in the match.   On the 18th, hit it in the bunker off the tee and it was no good.   And my second shot went left and I was never making birdie from there. 
With experience you learn that, but hopefully we'll be back next year.

Q.   How much match play did you play growing up?   Obviously if you haven't played this before‑‑ you played Presidents Cup?
MARC LEISHMAN:   I played quite a lot as an amateur.   I haven't played it for a few years, obviously.   As a pro, you don't really play it at all, the Presidents Cup and this. 

Q.   You played pretty good at the Presidents Cup, didn't you? 
MARC LEISHMAN:   Yeah, I played pretty well.   We used to play quite a lot.   We'd have a pennant competition or club competition at home.   That was match play.   The Australian Amateur, the state amateurs were all match play.   We played quite a bit, so I feel like I got a decent amount of experience in match play.   Just couldn't make the most of it today. 

Q.   What's your schedule like from here on out?
MARC LEISHMAN:   Tampa and Bay Hill, then the Masters and Hilton Head.
