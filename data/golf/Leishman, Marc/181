   MARC LEISHMAN: It was good. I started off well and had a couple of bogeys in the middle of the round but I'm under par, so I'll be all right. Going to try to have a another good one this week like I had last week. It was very calm out there this morning. A few holes it blew a little bit, but pretty nice today. It might get up a little bit, but I wouldn't think it would get up too much.  
  
  Q. Just a continuation of your form from last week?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: Yeah, hitting the ball. I'm putting pretty good, reading the greens well. It's good to hit a putt where you want to hit it and it goes in. It hasn't been happening the last few weeks, so it's nice to see.  
  
  Q. Want to tell me how you made those birdies?   
 MARC LEISHMAN: I birdied 17, that was a really good putt from about 15 feet.  
  
  Q. What did you hit in there?  
 MARC LEISHMAN: 7-iron. I birdied 14. It was about a ten-footer, I guess.
