Q. Just talk a little bit about how it went today.
AMY MATSUOKA: It went really well.  My drives were pretty straight on the fairway, and I was sticking it pretty close.
Q. What's your experience with this course?  What did you get in practice-wise this week?
AMY MATSUOKA: I just made sure that my ball stayed in the fairway because if you go into the rough, it's pretty hard to get out.
Q. How were you battling the heat and the walk?
AMY MATSUOKA: I actually just played a tournament in Palm Springs, where it was 120 degrees, so this doesn't feel that bad.
Q. What's the game plan going into tomorrow?
AMY MATSUOKA: Just do the same as I did today and just play my best.
Q. It's a long championship, a lot of days; how do you kind of break it up in your mind knowing that match play is ahead?
AMY MATSUOKA: Just go day by day, hole by hole, yeah.
Q. What's your experience in this championship in the past?
AMY MATSUOKA: This is actually my first time, so it's really exciting.
Q. How has the experience been this week?
AMY MATSUOKA: It's a great venue.  Everyone is really welcoming, and the staff is really great.  The course is awesome.
