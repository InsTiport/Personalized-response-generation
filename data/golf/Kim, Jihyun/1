Q. Nice round.  How do you feel about how you played and do you think you're close enough to challenge tomorrow for the title?
JIHYUN KIM: I feel that I had pretty good play all day today and I try to have no bogey all the way through except I guess the last hole I just did not make it but sometimes the shots were a bit shaky at times but I think I managed to cover it with approach and putting.
So I think I'm pretty happy with overall with how my play went today except I guess missing the last hole, no bogey play but it was a bit challenging to catch the pins at the last hole.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased with how we went today.
Q. South Koreans have had so much success over the last ten years in this championship.  How do you explain that?
JIHYUN KIM: I personally like the challenge of the course, like the one here and maybe that is why that it worked out so well for me today or this week.  My weaker point is putting but I managed having more success with putting this week.  So, I'm happy with that.
Q. 20 year anniversary of Se Ri Pak winning this championship.  What does Se Ri mean to you?
JIHYUN KIM: I do remember, that is one tournament that not only myself, I think lot of Koreans just cannot forget and as a nation we were having pretty tough time at the time and I think that really ran a lot of people's spirit up winning at this tournament.  Personally, it is a great honor for me to be here and play this great tournament and I've been happy with it.
