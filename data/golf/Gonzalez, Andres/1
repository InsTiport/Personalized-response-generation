Q. Nice finish there. Couple birdies coming in and a great week. 
ANDRES GONZALES: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was a big week for me that clinched my card for next year, so I'm very happy right now.

Q. Yeah, talk a little bit about that. Were you putting any pressure on? I think you're currently projected like 92nd or something, which is now pretty safe. 
ANDRES GONZALES: No. I just wanted to play well.

Q. Right. 
ANDRES GONZALES: I've been playing pretty well all year. Just like middle of the season I didn't really get a lot of the game. I was missing cuts by a shot here and there. 

Q. Talk about your round a little bit today. 
ANDRES GONZALES: Yeah, I had one extraordinary hole actually, hole 13. Hit it left; had to take an unplayable and it was on the cart path and it bounced back into the unplayable so I had to play it.
Went backwards hitting my third shot. Tried to hit it like back in the fairway and it went backwards about 80 yards again and I had to lay up to 73 yards and I holed it for a bogey to save two points. 
Best bogey you've ever seen.
