 Q.   Maybe you can just kind of tell us about your overall round today.   How it went.   
ANDRES GONZALES:   Bogey‑free.   Made seven birdies and that was kind of my goal was just ‑‑ I've been playing pretty consistently and the last couple days I finished with a bogey on the last hole.   Even though I played pretty well, it just left a bad taste in my mouth.   So just tried to stay patient out there and hit fairways and greens and I've been putting pretty well.   
   
 Q.   Overall strategy?  
ANDRES GONZALES:   It was just cliche golf.   Hit the fairway, hit the green and then give myself as many birdie opportunities as I can.   If I can make half of them, then I should be in good shape.   
   
 Q.   So what are your thoughts going into tomorrow?  
ANDRES GONZALES:   Same thing.   If I can get the putter hot then I have a really good chance at ‑‑ I don't know what everybody else is at.   I don't look at leaderboards very much, but I'm pleased with the way that I'm playing, so I would assume that I'm kind of near the hunt and that's the biggest thing, just control what I can control.   
The reason I don't look at leaderboards that much is I don't want to know what other people are doing because what they're doing shouldn't affect what I'm doing.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of this weather?  
ANDRES GONZALES:   It's fantastic.   How can you beat Pebble Beach?   You're just in God's country up here and having perfect weather.
