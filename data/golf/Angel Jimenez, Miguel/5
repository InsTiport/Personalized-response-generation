MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, he's a real inspiration through the years, what he's done.  This week, especially the first two rounds when I played with Tom Watson and Bernhard Langer, both of them, the way they were striking the ball, and it's amazing to play with them.

 Q.  And also, on 17, that was a key putt.
