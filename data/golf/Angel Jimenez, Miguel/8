 Q.  Do you get the old feeling of excitement here?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's always nice.  There's a mystique and you know you always have to play on the left side and be in position and stay out of the bunkers, that's the main thing.  But always a pleasure coming here to the Home of Golf and playing St. Andrews.   
 Q.  You've had some interesting times here, haven't you, I remember back at 17 against the wall.  But that's what happens at St. Andrews, it's always fun.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Sometimes you can have those kind of shots, a shot for the history, they are going to be there for ever.   
 Q.  I hope you didn't do that today.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: No, I hit a beautiful second shot and I made seven foot for birdie and the hole is moving.  I hit a beautiful shot there but it happens; golf.   
 Q.  Playing well?  I see you won a nice major.  Good to get a senior major, as well?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Very nice.  I'm playing very well, very solid today.  I've been playing well all year in the state and today I have a bogey-free round.  But I miss only one shot on 11, and I make a beautiful shot from down there and I recovered.  Then hit a good shot, a little bit too low on 16 where I put my ball in the bunker.  I put it sideways and then hit a beautiful shot there and holed a 6-foot putt for par.  That's the only thing, a lot of shots for birdies, and I'm happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  And what a great three ball.  There's a lot of titles between Langer, Watson and you between you.  Was that quite enjoyable?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Very enjoyable.  All three of us play well and that's something that's always good.  Someone by your side who is playing good, he's making birdies, keeps the focus on making birdies.
