 Q.  Senior Open Champion, do you feel as though you made it harder than you'd like to coming down the stretch?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, you say it right. I'm hitting very solid all the time and then you get into hole No. 14 with a three-shot lead and my ball just on the green, and then miss a very short putt for birdie.   
On the next hole, on the 15th, just saw the green there, left the first putt a little bit short and then I had a 4-footer and missed the hole again. My heart starts pounding very fast now.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to win The Senior Open here at the Home of Golf?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, well, it's amazing, obviously at St. Andrews, as you say, the Home of Golf, it's a place that many people want to win. Yes, Seve played well in the British Open, and so it's amazing to be here in this place with all these things, and my name is part of history.
