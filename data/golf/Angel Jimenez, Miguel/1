 Q.  Three birdies in the last four holes today.  You must be happy with that.  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, very happy with that.  A bit unfair on the golf course -- I hit some poor shots, as well as 18, holed a nice putt.  Overall, No. 11, No. 12, I played solid, played well.   
 Q.  How can you found it?  It's quite a testing golf course.  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's nice.  We played with a different wind yesterday.  It's a completely different course that we played yesterday than with the westerly wind today.  It was pretty testing, different bunkers today from the tee.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, only four shots off the lead, so you're in good position?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: I am in a perfect position.  I just put my breath on the other people's necks, you know.  I'm just kidding.   
No, it's fine.  It's good.  Four shots with two rounds to go, it's four shots, but it's nothing that's too far away.  Just keep focused and enjoy yourself on the golf course.  That's what you need to do.
