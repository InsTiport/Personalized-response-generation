Q. Thoughts on how your week went.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well the week was very nice.  I played very solid, very well.  Probably I missed some luck on the greens.  When I see myself compared with the guys on the leaderboard, they holed a few more putts than me.  I played very well, very solid and happy with the tournament, with the golf course, it was in super condition with the ambience and the field and I'm very happy to be here.  I'm very happy.
Q. Putting was the culprit for you?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, it's crucial.  Obviously, the game is very good, but putting is not consistent and that probably is what made the difference.
