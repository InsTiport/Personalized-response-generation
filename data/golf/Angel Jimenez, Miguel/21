 Q.  Unfortunately it wasn't your day.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: No, 75 today, today is the other side of the coin from yesterday.  A little bit tense, not loose in the beginning of the round there, and then didn't play as well as yesterday.  I've been also the greens, a little bit slow today.  And then I started on No. 4 missing for a birdie.   
You know, the double-bogey on the last hole, tried to put the ball close and I thinned it too much in the bunker and made a double-bogey.  5-iron second shot there, blocked it a little bit, the ball, hit it in the green and put it in the water.   
 Q.  There must be a lot of confidence you can take going into the U.S. Open.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, the way I'm swinging the club, the way I'm hitting the ball, I feel comfortable with that.  I'm going to miss shots like everyone misses shots.  The thing is it's so tough for me to recover; every time I missed a shot, I couldn't recover anything.  I just make a bogey or double-bogey.
