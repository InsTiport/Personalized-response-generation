 Q. In your fourth time out at the Senior PGA Championship, you made the cut and you've shot some of your best scores ever. Talk about that experience?
 JAMES BLAIR: It's a nice course for me. It's great playing with Tom today. It was fun. He had a great round, so that was the chance of a lifetime. And I'm fairly pleased. I drove it pretty good and just it was nice to make the cut and nice to be here on the weekend. 

 Q. And you set your Senior PGA record in terms of low score. 
 JAMES BLAIR: Yeah, I did. 

 Q. So you got a special hat today, you got the New York Yankees?
 JAMES BLAIR: I should have bought a Cleveland hat, but I'm always wearing a Yankee hat.

 Q. And the pin stripe shoes match as well. 
 JAMES BLAIR: Yeah.
