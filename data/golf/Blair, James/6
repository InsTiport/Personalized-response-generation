  Q. Talked to a couple players who said that this course place two different nines and your round is kind of the epitome of that. Talk a little bit about that.   
 JAMES BLAIR: Well, I didn't really notice that. You got to hit the ball in play and I didn't get it in play my first nine and I shot 40. Then I got it in play my second nine and I shot 31. So I had some good eyes on the putts that helped and I made a lot of putts. I made five birdies. So that's good for me.   
  
  Q. What got you going on the back? Was it anything in particular?  
 JAMES BLAIR: No, I was just started making some putts, you know, making some birdies. I had too many bogeys, I had six bogeys, so that's the way it goes.
