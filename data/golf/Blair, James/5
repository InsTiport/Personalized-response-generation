 Q. Tell us about your round today. 
 JAMES BLAIR: I got off to a good start, I had a good chance. I missed four or five fairways and that's where it's all at. And every time I made a bogey it was from just not hitting the fairway. Other than that it was pretty commercial.

 Q. This is the first time you've made the cut in this event. You've built on your experiences in here and how does this rank among the events you played in?
 JAMES BLAIR: Well, I played six or seven PGAs. It's kind of early, being from the north, you know, we don't, most of us club pros that are up north don't have much game. I started, I played a few events, section events earlier this year, in March and April so I wouldn't totally embarrass myself, but I'm holding up all right. Hopefully I'll have a good round tomorrow.
