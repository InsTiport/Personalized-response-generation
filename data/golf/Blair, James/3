 Q. Just some general comments on your round today. You shot pretty well. 
 JAMES BLAIR, III: I drove it pretty good and I hit a lot of greens. Didn't get in any trouble. I had one blip. I made a double on a real easy hole with a perfect drive. 
 But other than that it was a pretty solid round. I didn't have very many good birdie putts until I had those two gimmies coming in so, but that was nice.

 Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow, playing in the morning, just will that benefit you at all?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: Oh, I don't even worry about that. I just try and hit my first tee shot in play and go from there.

 Q. What about the wind, was that a factor do you feel out there today?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: You know what? I play pretty good in the wind, as long as it's not tougher than this. So I did all right. I parred the tough holes, most of them, I think. The wind, as long as it doesn't get a whole lot tougher I'm all right in it.
