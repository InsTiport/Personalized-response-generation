 Q. How was your experience here at the Colorado Golf Club?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: It was fun. I didn't play real well. I played well, I didn't score real well. But I love the golf course. 
 I made the cut, that was my primary goal. I didn't have, really have a very good round any of the four days, but I haven't played much.

 Q. What do you think you're going to work on in the future to try and get back here?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: Well I'll start playing again this fall. I don't know how much I'm going to play this summer, but we have the National Senior Club Pro. And just work on my short game, that was really missing this week. But I enjoyed it.
