 Q. You're tied right now for the low club pro. How do you feel about that? 
 JAMES BLAIR, III: Well, that's nice. I don't think about that kind of stuff, just go out and hit the fairway tomorrow and see if I can't get some putts to drop.

 Q. When you're out there, do you think about where you lie among club pros?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: No.

 Q. You just go for it?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: Yeah. Just try and do the best I can. 

 Q. Are you getting a lot of support from home?
 JAMES BLAIR, III: Yeah, yeah. My son's caddying for me and we're doing all right. It's good.
