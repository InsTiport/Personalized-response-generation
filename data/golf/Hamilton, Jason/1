    (Lydia Ko's caddie)  
  
 Q. What was the kind of final explanation there on the tree incident?  
JASON HAMILTON:   Well, I didn't hesitate going up there because I thought we had to identify the ball to be able to take an unplayable.   Not being able to see it from the ground, I thought I'd better get up there.   One of the other caddies gave me a boost, otherwise I couldn't jump up and grab the limb.   So climbed up and shook the tree as well as I could for about three or four minutes without falling out, and to no avail, but fortunately the official came along and told us that if it's unanimous consensus that the ball hitched up the tree and we know the approximate location, then that's fine, just take an unplayable, so it was all for nothing in the end.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever done anything like that before?  
JASON HAMILTON:   No, I haven't got up that high before.   That was probably a new record for me.   I'm too old for climbing trees.  
   
 Q.   She was impressed with your agility, though; that's going to be a good thing, right?   
JASON HAMILTON:   Yeah, well, I was hanging on pretty tight.   I didn't want to fall out.  
   
 Q.   Were you a little worried about getting down there?   
JASON HAMILTON:   Yeah, it was a little hairy.   Once I was up there, I didn't think about getting down until I was up there.   I just had to figure it out on the fly.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever had a player lose a ball in a tree like that?  
JASON HAMILTON:   One other time in Palm Springs, but it was one of them spiky palm trees, and I wasn't going up that one.
