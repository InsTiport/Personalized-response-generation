  OSCAR FLOREN:   Didn't play as well today.   Rhythm felt a bit off and the swing.   When it feels off like, that I can have some bad misses.   I hung in there and did my best and that's all I can ask for.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk me through?   You started with a birdie.   
OSCAR FLOREN:   I started, hit two great shots on 1, hit it to about three feet.   Two good shots on 4, made it up‑and‑down from the bunker.   
And good tee shot on 5, bad second shot, left it in the wrong place.   I made a bogey, bad wedge and 3‑putted there.   My putter wasn't good today.  
But then I hung in there, I had some chances and made a great par on 11 after being in the fairway bunker.  
Birdied 13, but drove it bad and got lucky on 15, the par5 and drove it in the bunker 16, so I made bogey there.   Hit driver and two good shots on 18.   Raced the first putt but made the second which was nice.   
   
 Q.   So you're positive‑‑  
OSCAR FLOREN:   Positive is my worst score is a bogey and I'm hanging in there.   Today, it's tougher today.   Wind was up a bit.   So I'm hanging in there at least.   That's all I can ask for.  
   
 Q.   Couple of shots off the lead.   
OSCAR FLOREN:   Yeah, just do the same in the weekend, do my best, get a little bit of practise in this afternoon, and then take it easy and off we go tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Do you like this course?  
OSCAR FLOREN:   Yeah, it's a great golf course, great track, yeah.   I like it.   As long as you stay out of the fairway bunkers, it's fine.   It a great track.   
I was a bit lucky with the draw I would say, being on this side, I will see.   The other guys, they have a bit tougher test this afternoon I think but overall I'm pleased.
