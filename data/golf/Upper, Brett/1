  Q. Even though you didn't get anything started today, how was the experience?  
 BRETT UPPER: It was great. Great. The golf course was perfect. The golf course couldn't be any better. The weather is great. Just didn't make any putts, that's all.  
  
  Q. From yesterday to today did you change anything? Or did you just do the same things?  
 BRETT UPPER: Pretty much the same mentality, you know, I tried to think a little better, tried to not pull as many bad clubs, but just didn't putt very well and I made five or six bad club selections. That and when you don't make putts, it's hard to score good. If you don't putt well and you make some mental errors, you know.  
 But I enjoyed it immensely. It was a pleasure.
