Q.   Great eagle on No. 12.   Could you explain a little bit about that?
JOHN ROSS:   Well, let's see, I hit a perfect tee shot around the corner and I had 93 yards left to the hole and I hit my 54 degree sand wedge and the ball carried about a foot past the hole and took one bounce and spun back in. 

Q.   Very nice. 
JOHN ROSS:   I was having trouble making putts, so I figured that was the best way to eliminate having to worry about making putts. 

Q.   How did you think about the wind conditions and everything compared to the practice rounds?
JOHN ROSS:   The wind was tricky, it was swirling and gusting, but if you could get it figured out, you could hit a good shot. 
But it was tough today.   But when you're this close to the lake you're going to have wind like this. 

Q.   You finished 1â€‘over, good luck with the rest of the tournament. 
JOHN ROSS:   Thank you very much.
