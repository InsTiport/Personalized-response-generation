 Q. 68. Great round. Best round on this course. Was it tough out there?
 JOHN ROSS: Well, after shooting 40 and 41 and 41 on the front nine the first three days, my caddie and I had a little joke we were going to go out and break 40 today. 
 I shot even par on the front, only had one bogey and that was a 3-putt on 7. So I knew I was playing well. And I played the back nine well all week. 
 There was less wind today. But then again the characteristics of this golf course don't change, you got to put the ball in the fairway. And I made a couple of good par saves on the last couple holes. But I missed a couple of, I missed a couple of six foot birdie putts early in the round too. 
 But I'm not by any means going to complain after shooting 68 here. It leaves a good taste in my mouth. I have a lot of respect for this golf course. Donald Ross, I love his designs and to see how this course has withstood the time and technology, it's a beauty. 

 Q. How much confidence does this give you coming up to the final round, 68, Major Championship, how much confidence are you going to take from this?
 JOHN ROSS: Well, I need to build on it. Last year I finished pretty shaky. And I was in the next to the last group going into the final round at Whistling Straights last year at the U.S. Open and unfortunately I stumbled to a 79 the last day. 
 But it confirms to me that I can play at this level. And I'm not what you would call normally a birdie machine. But I enjoy the tough golf courses where par is a good score. 
 Unfortunately, I just had too many unforced errors over the course of the first two rounds. But I'm going to use this as a building block and move on to Des Moines to qualify Tuesday for our next Champions Tour event there.
