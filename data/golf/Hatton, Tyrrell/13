Q. Huge congratulations, to hold that trophy in particular here at Wentworth, it must feel incredibly special?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it's very special to be standing here holding this.  It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid to play the tournament and hopefully win it one day, and thankfully this year is my year.
Q. It was a fantastic round of golf, as well, but how aware were you of what was happening?  It got a little close at one point?
TYRRELL HATTON:   The last few holes, I didn't know exactly where I stood.  I was really nervous playing the last few, but once I fatted my second shot and we got very lucky that it didn't go in the water, I found out that I had a three-shot lead, so that settled me down a little bit.  It was nice to get up-and-down after a terrible golf shot.
Q. We saw the picture of you as a six-year-old here watching, what do you say to young kids who may be watching you now, standing here with a trophy in terms of following your dreams?
TYRRELL HATTON:   I think you have to dream big, and obviously work hard and give it your best shot, and then hope everything kind of works out.
Q. A lot of golf still to come.  What's coming up next moving towards the final major of the year?
TYRRELL HATTON:   I'm actually in Vegas next week for CJ Cup and on to L.A. for ZoZo.  I've got a busy stretch coming up.  This is the start of I think six tournaments in seven weeks for me.  It's obviously nice to win, and I'll take a lot of confidence from this week.
