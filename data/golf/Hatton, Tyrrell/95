 Q.  On the whole, fantastic day out there for you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely.  If you said I was going to shoot 7-under after my first seven holes today, I probably would have been slightly surprised.  No, it was a great last 11 holes.  I'll try and forget about the ninth green.   
 Q.  You knew you had to do something special today to be in the mix for tomorrow.  Was there something that clicked?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, the first few holes started off as they had very similar to the previous two rounds.  I hit really good shot into 17, went for the green, hit it to about six or eight feet and made that and I'm 2-under.  So set me off and got on a good run there.   
 Q.  You had an early start today.  Did you feel some good form coming into today?  Did you know it was close?  
TYRRELL HATTON: No, not at all.  I didn't strike the ball particularly well, especially this morning.  And playing next to Stenson and Garcia, probably exaggerated that for me because they hit the ball so good.  It was frustrating this morning.  Although I scored actually okay, my game just didn't feel good at all.   
So I'm very happy with this afternoon's score.   
 Q.  You seem to have an affinity with Dubai golf.  Is there something you like about it out here?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I love being out here.  The golf courses are fantastic and always in good condition.  Quick greens is what players like, so I always look forward to coming back.
