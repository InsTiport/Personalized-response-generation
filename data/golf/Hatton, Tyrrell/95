Q. Thoughts on opening 67?
TYRRELL HATTON: I'm over the moon with that to be honest.  I wasn't sure how it would go out there, being my first round back.  Really happy, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the week now.
Q. A few highlights?
TYRRELL HATTON: I think a couple of the long putts I holed, on the first green and again on the fifth.  I seem to be better putting from about 50 feet today than I was from inside ten.  Just one of those days, but I'm very happy.
Q. Gives a sense of conditions out there.
TYRRELL HATTON: Greens are perfect.  They always are here.  It's always nice coming back.  It's one of my favourite events of the year.  Always look forward to it.
Q. What does that give you, momentum going into day two?
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously it gives me some confidence because I didn't feel that great out there today.  But I'll take that into the next few rounds.  Hopefully I can play well.
Q. Why didn't you feel great?  What was missing?
TYRRELL HATTON: I think just being rusty and I haven't played a tournament for two months.  I put the clubs away over Christmas, and it takes awhile getting back into it again.
Q. Do you feel you play better when you're on a run?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I think that definitely helps me out.  You know, when I'm home, as well, I definitely see a difference if I continue playing when I'm home rather than just hitting balls and stuff.
It will take a while to get fully comfortable again but it's just one of those things.
