  Q. You started the round one shot ahead and ended it one shot behind.  Give us a verdict on your day's play?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it was a difficult day.  The conditions were really tough for the whole day.  Although I'm pretty disappointed to be honest.  I feel like coming back in this morning, I didn't finish off my round too well and I didn't actually do anything too wrong.
 Then today, round three, I just felt like I had nothing really go my way.  Hit a couple decent shots and ran into a bunker with a terrible lie and had quite a few putts burning the edge or lipping out.  Pretty disappointed.
 Q. 12-under par for the first 31 holes and level far for 23 holes.  Did it feel different from the get-go?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   I was trying my best and obviously one of them days where nothing -- I didn't really feel like anything went my way.
 So I guess you're always going to have days like that, and you just try and get through it and the good thing is that I'm still in contention going into the final round.  Will be obviously one shot back which isn't ideal but a lot can happen in 18 holes.
 So hopefully things go my way tomorrow.
 Q. Obviously very excited about the idea of McIlroy, Fleetwood, Hatton and others going at it hard tomorrow in this magnificent tournament.  Give us your thoughts on it?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it's pretty cool group to be a part of tomorrow.  I'm sure the standard of golf will be pretty good and hoping that I can play well and give myself a chance to win.
