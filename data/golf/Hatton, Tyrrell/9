Q. The second round of 4-under par 68; give us your verdict on that one.
TYRRELL HATTON:   I think the score is quite generous for how I played.  I didn't feel that comfortable out there.  On the course I was kind of tinkering and trying to find something.  Obviously happy to go bogey-free and in a decent position going into the weekend.
Q. The only player today who has gone bogey-free, so what was the key to that?
TYRRELL HATTON:   A bit of luck when I needed it.  From memory, I don't think there was too many shots that were really bad, like where I was in a sort of difficult position, so I guess my misses ended up okay.
Q. Tell us about the second shot to 18 because you were in there going for the green and then you suddenly changed your mind.
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I really wanted to go for it, but as I stood over it, I was like, it would be stupid.  The 3-wood wasn't just kind of -- it didn't want to go into the grass at all.  The grass seemed quite hard, so there was just no point.  So I just hit a 7-iron up there, tried to give myself a decent number and didn't hit a great wedge shot in, unfortunately.
Q. Two massive wins for you already this season at the BMW PGA and the Arnold Palmer Invitational.  It's going to be a great year whatever happens this weekend.  Does that give you the freedom to just go for this and really try and win obviously the tournament and also the Race to Dubai?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I'm not really thinking about all that kind of stuff, just trying to go out there and play my best each day and try and give myself an opportunity come Sunday and see what happens.
