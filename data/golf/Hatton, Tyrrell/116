 Q.  What are your thoughts on winning handsomely today?  
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, obviously really happy to get it done fairly early.  It was always going to be a tough match against Pete today.  Felt I was a little bit lucky.  I had a couple of chip-ins which always helps, and just happy to get through to the next round.   
 Q.  Always helps in that it's demoralising for your opponent, as well, isn't it?  
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, especially on 12, the par 3.  He hit a great shot in there, and I was 20 yards right of the pin and chip-in, and all of a sudden he's got that for the halve.  But that's typical match play really, isn't it.   
 Q.  Presumably happy across the course of the week, because it's been impressive victories all the way, hasn't it.  
TYRELL HATTON: Match play is never an easy game.  Played really well yesterday.  I was 4-under in those conditions, which is pretty good.  I've been pretty steady and hopefully I can keep that going in the afternoon.   
 Q.  You mentioned conditions and this wind seems to be picking up.  You might have it trickier this afternoon.  
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, I think when we started this morning, the wind wasn't that strong but it's picking up as the day goes on.  So fingers crossed it stays dry.  But whatever we get, we get.   
 Q.  You like this style of golf, playing links, like you played well at Royal Aberdeen.  
TYRELL HATTON: I seem to have done well on links courses, and hopefully I'll keep that run going.
