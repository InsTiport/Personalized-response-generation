TYRRELL HATTON: I'm very happy with that.  Not quite how I wanted to play, but overall, if I can play like that and score that well, then that's obviously really good.  So I'll take a bit of confidence from that and hopefully have a good weekend.   
 Q.  Fantastic chip-in from you on 15, as well?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, that was a bonus to see that one go in.  Slightly awkward stance and you hope that you get a good strike and get it close enough to the hole where you can make par and to see it drop was obviously very nice.   
 Q.  Obviously you won the Dunhill Links the last two years.  Does that putt more pressure on you, yourself, to come and perform well on links golf courses?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Really, just another tournament at the end of the day.  We're all here every week trying to play our best and fortunately for me I've played well on links courses in the past, had good finishes in this tournament.  So you know rebound hopefully I'll continue that this weekend.   
 Q.  You've already won a Rolex Series Event.  Would be nice to add another one to that.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely, but there's a hell of a lot of golf to be played between now and then, so like I said, hopefully I can just play well, play better than I did today.  Obviously keep the putts rolling in and that would be great.
