Q. You got through the turn, you were 1 down.  Then at the 10th you made what was an important one.  These are always important in match play, the 5- and 6-footers.
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely.  I thought I actually hit it through the break when I first hit it.  Obviously it catched the right edge and sneaked in.
Q. Then you win 11.  Then at 12, you didn't hit the putt you wanted to obviously here.  And then I'm just wondering where were you there?
TYRRELL HATTON: To be honest, I was an angry little man out there today.
Q. But that's your style in a way, isn't it?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it is.  But that was just bad out there today even by my standards.  I shouldn't make excuses.  I had a shocking night's sleep and just woke up and really bad mood and couldn't really settle myself down out there.  You see the consequences of stuff like that.  Hopefully I can be a little more patient tomorrow and get a better night's sleep.
Q. In the end match play is all about getting the job done.  You closed it out on 17.  You get a win on the first day.  Very positive going forward.
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I'm really happy to get my first win.  Obviously it's my first time here.  I will take my competition tomorrow and hopefully I can play better.
