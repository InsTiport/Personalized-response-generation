 Q.   Round started with four birdies, ended in 4â€‘under par, how do you feel about that one?   
TYRRELL HATTON:   Obviously got off to a great start.   I think it's always difficult to keep momentum going once you get off to a start like that.   So slightly disappointing.   I struggled around the back nine with the wind.   I thought it changed a lot when we got over the ball and it's just difficult to get close.   Overall I'm quite happy, so it's another good round.   
   
 Q.   First season on The European Tour, how would you appraise it as it comes to an end?   
TYRRELL HATTON:   It's been a great year.   All I wanted at the start of the year was just to keep my card.   So to be playing here is special.   I've got my family with me this week which is great, so I'm having a good week.  
   
 Q.   What's the most valuable thing you've learnt in this first year, your rookie year?  
TYRRELL HATTON:   I think the biggest thing is that knowing if I play well, I can win.   Obviously haven't won yet but I came close in Switzerland, so I would say that.  
   
 Q.   You have a chance to win this weekend.   Do you feel ready to take it?  
TYRRELL HATTON:   Hopefully.   But I look forward to that and hopefully I'll get into that position.
