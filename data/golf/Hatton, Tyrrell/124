Q.   Final round of 68 to finish in fourth position, give us a feel of how you felt you played today?
TYRRELL HATTON:   I felt like I played quite well considering the pressure today.   Obviously quite a few things at the back of my mind.   I was quite happy with how I played.   Obviously disappointed to bogey the last, otherwise I would have been bogeyâ€‘free on Sunday, which I would have been over the moon with.   Yeah, can't complain. 

Q.   Commentators were a little bit critical of your attitude today.   They felt you were being too hard of yourself and showing too much emotion.   Is that something you're aware of and feel you have to work on? 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, definitely, a lot of pressure going on today and I've got high expectations.   Sometimes when I don't sort of meet that expectation or reach that level, I sort of show it.   But it's something I need to get better at.   I'm young so plenty of years to get better at it.

Q.   Overall how valuable are experiences like this in your development? 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it's crucial.   I feel like I held it together quite well.   But yeah, I need to get better.

Q.   You qualify for The Open Championship next week, how excited are you about that? 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, over the moon with that.   It will be my third open, so, yeah, can't wait.
