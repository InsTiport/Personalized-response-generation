Q. Only one blemish on the card today. What was working so well for you out there today?
TYRRELL HATTON: Just putted really well. I actually feel like I struggled a bit with shots into the green, but yeah, just putted nicely and that was a big part of the score today.
Q. How big is that when you say you struggle with your swing but you kind of make it up with it on the greens. Does it kind of boost your confidence a little bit?
TYRRELL HATTON: A little bit, but it's kind of, you play great and you miss putts that are not so good and then to hole putts, I guess we're all just kind of waiting for those weeks where it comes together. Obviously today's a good start and I think it's only going to get tougher out there this afternoon with the wind picking up. So very happy with my morning's work and enjoy the afternoon off.
Q. When the wind started to kick up a little bit towards the end of your round did the course change at all?
TYRRELL HATTON: Not massively. I mean, the greens are pretty firm anyway so I think they're only going to get firmer throughout the week. I wouldn't say it was an advantage going out really early this morning because they were still kind of rock hard then. So it's an interesting challenge, the course is in great condition and we'll see how it goes.
