 Q.  Not the finish you'd have liked but the way you battled today, you must be proud?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, really happy with how I played today.  It was pretty tough conditions, a bit windier than previous days.  So to go bogey-free is always good.  So overall, I'd say pretty happy.   
 Q.  Just talk us through those last few holes.  The?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I watched the chip shot go straight past the hole, so I was pretty confident it was a pretty straight putt and I feel like I hit a good putt, and and it just turned a little bit right-to-left and obviously just misses left, which is to my surprise.   
Then 18, you know, I just hit the wrong club, second shot.  So it was pretty poor to be honest that we hit 5-wood there.  You just can't miss it short.  Just very disappointed with that.  Overall, it's been a great week.   
 Q.  What was the thought process going into 18?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Probably there wasn't much thought.  That was the problem, which is not ideal when there's two of you there.  We should have hit 3-wood, but got to learn from mistakes, and unfortunately, that was a massive mistake at the wrong time in a big tournament.   
So you know, that hurts, but I can't change that now, unfortunately.  That's done.  But if you'd told me that I'd shoot 6-under today and finish potentially third on my own, then you know, I'd have been pretty happy with that.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind when you got to within one of the lead midway through the back nine?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Just focusing on trying to make more birdies.  It's as simple as that.  That's always the goal no matter where you are in the tournament, you're always trying to make as many birdies as possible.   
I gave myself decent chances on 16 and in the end, wasn't a bad chance and 17, obviously that was one that slipped by.  But you know, I did also make a really good par save on 12.  I guess it swings in roundabouts.  You make some, you miss some, but I can't be too disappointed with that, really.   
 Q.  Must be lots of positives to take from this.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's been a really good three weeks throughout the year.  Obviously EurAsia Cup was fun and I absolutely loved being in the team event and pretty solid week last week and then to come here which is one of my favourite events of the year.  It just been a good three weeks to start the year.
