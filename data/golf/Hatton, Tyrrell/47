 Q.  How was that for you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was a tough day, tough conditions out here.  So it was always going to be tough for scoring.  Feel like I actually played okay.  Hit a few poor shots, which is easy to do today, but happy with how I played my last nine holes.  Gave myself plenty of opportunities, and it was nice to hole a couple and yeah, just happy to get under par, really, after the front nine.   
 Q.  What was the change, was it a tactic change?  
TYRRELL HATTON: No, no tactic change.  I guess not thinking about golf maybe helped.   
Yeah, it was a tough day, sort of emotionally on the golf course.  Just glad to finish under par.   
 Q.  Happy with the round and looking forward to Carnoustie tomorrow?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yes, I'm hoping Carnoustie will be not so windy.  Conditions hopefully will be kind.  Obviously we know the course well from playing here the last few years, and obviously they had The Open this year.   
So it's a course that I'm pretty comfortable on, so hopefully I can keep playing well and post a good score.
