 Q.  How good a round was that today?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I'm happy with the score.  I got off to a fairly inconsistent start.  But I putted pretty well again today, and that was the key to today's score.   
 Q.  You mentioned that start, I think it was the eighth hole before you had your first par, wasn't it?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I was raging that I missed that birdie putt, and I walked off the green, thinking that is my first par.  But it was just one of those starts I guess.  Just happy to shoot a good score in the end.   
 Q.  Is it just the nature of this course or just one of those days?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I think it's just one of those days.  I feel really comfortable on this golf course and hopefully I get off to a slightly better start or more consistent start tomorrow, but throw in a few birdies.  We'll see; I'm in a good position going into the final round.   
 Q.  You are in a very good position into that final round.  Are you conscious of other players when they are shooting the low scores, like a 63 that Rafa Cabrera-Bello has managed today?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, that's a great score today.  I do look at the leaderboard a lot to know where I'm at, and tomorrow won't be any different.  So hopefully I can play well and climb another spot.   
 Q.  Do you see that kind of score yourself out there?  
TYRRELL HATTON: For sure, hit it close and hole the putts, and you know you can shoot low on any course.  But I'll try my best tomorrow and whatever happens, happens.
