Q. Just talk about losing the match and going into the playoff.
TYRRELL HATTON: After leaving early I was pretty frustrated.  But I didn't have much time after that match finished to go out in the playoff.  I knew I needed to regroup and I had ten minutes to smash a few drivers and get ready for the playoff.  I felt like I dealt with it pretty well.  And it was nice to hit a couple of good shots.
Q. It's nice to move on.
TYRRELL HATTON: It is a little bit.  I would rather have not gone through that today.  Bad memories from last year, so I'm happy that I could erase them, I guess, and advance to the weekend.
Q. What are your thoughts going to the Round of 16?
TYRRELL HATTON: Treat it the same as I have the previous three days, just go out there and win your matches.
