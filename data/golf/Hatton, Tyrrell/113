 Q.  What does this second place finish in The Scottish Open mean to you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I'm really happy with that result.  Part of me is slightly disappointed in a way, one short.  But I played well.  Tried to stay as patient as I can.  Obviously I find that one of the difficult aspects.  But I'm just quite happy I guess.   
 Q.  Patience is the key, isn't it, on any course, but the way that you had to make par after par, a mixture of scrambles, and then, the chance came.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Earlier on in the year, after the start I had where I missed a few chances earlier on, there was a good chance my head would have gone down.  But my caddie, he was sort of trying to keep me upbeat and trying to stay positive.   
Luckily a couple of shots dropped on the back nine and second outright is my best finish on The European Tour.  A spot in The Open next week, as well as securing the PGA Championship in a few weeks' time, as well.  Overall, it's been a really good week.   
 Q.  There's every reason to be upbeat, particularly the fact that you were in there right to the death, and that birdie at the last does mean outright second.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, that was a huge putt.  I was really happy to see that one drop.  I holed a really good par putt on 17, as well.  You know, it's just a good finish to the week I guess.   
 Q.  As you've played alongside the man who has won, I have to ask for an appreciation of Alex Noren.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, he played great today.  He only dropped one shot, but still, was very solid and his short game was fantastic when he needed it.  Fair play to him and congratulations to him.  But hopefully my time is coming soon.
