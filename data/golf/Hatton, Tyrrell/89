TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously I've been on a good run.  So it was nice to go out there and get a win today.  I feel like it was a little bit of a scrappy game from both of us.  Like I said, I'm just happy to get my first win.   
 Q.  What do you think the reason is for that good run of late?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I think my putter has been helping me quite a bit.  I've been giving myself quite a few chances.  So overall my game is pretty solid.  Hopefully I can play a bit better than I did today.
