Q. Great score for you out there, how did it feel on one of the toughest courses going around?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, when the draw came out, obviously I was really happy I got Carnoustie first.  Just hoped it would be a calm day.  I think obviously the weather's been pretty kind to us compared to what it can be.  But I played really well today and I'm happy with that score.
Q. And what about playing out there with an amateur; did it relax you at all, or what's it like?  This event is quite different.
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously it's different to any other week.  You just have to try and have a bit of fun and obviously it's good to be playing with the amateurs and obviously playing with Jamie Dornan this week, and there's a bit of attention surrounding him.
It's really good and hopefully we can have another good three days.
Q. What are you hoping to get out of tomorrow and the next three days?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, Kingsbarns and St. Andrews are supposed to be sort of the easier two than Carnoustie.  Hopefully I can build on this score and keep playing well.
