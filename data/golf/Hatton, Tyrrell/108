Q. Tyrrell, first thing, you qualified the week of (inaudible).  How did that feel today?
TYRRELL HATTON: It was nice.  Obviously last year I played the Saturday here but that was because of the second round, so it was nice to be playing a third round on a Saturday, and I played really nicely out there.
Q. (Inaudible).
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, the back nine was obviously playing really tough.  I was struggling a little bit with my swing on the front nine; just not feeling comfortable and ball striking wasn't great.  Although I'd given myself a few chances, and then just on the back nine I played really well, just found something, I guess.  I think that's the best I've ever played, especially in those wind conditions.  Usually I struggle with wind in throughout the left.  It's obviously a tough wind for a right-handed golfer anyway, but I felt like I dealt with that really well.
Q. On the 8th (inaudible).  What were you doing?
TYRRELL HATTON: That hole has been very kind to me, and I'll happily take another 2 there tomorrow.
Q. (Inaudible) in itself, how big an achievement is that?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, it's been a good week so far.  Hopefully I can go out there tomorrow and play well.  There's obviously a lot of great players this week, and hopefully I can just have a good one tomorrow.
Q. (Inaudible) if you're in red figures come the final day, do you think there's any chance?
TYRRELL HATTON: I don't know.  I think there's a big gap between them and third place anyway.  But I'm not too worried about that.  I've just got to focus on my own game and hopefully I can play as well as I did on that back nine tomorrow, and this time around hopefully take my chances on the greens.
Q. (Inaudible).
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, you know, if I sort of make some putts, then that changes things.  Hopefully I can climb the leaderboard and we'll see what happens.
