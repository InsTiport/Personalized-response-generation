 Q.  Looks like you had a lot of fun out there and played some pretty good golf, as well?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was a pretty tough day, actually.  The conditions were quite -- it was really windy to begin with.  Kingsbarns is known as like sort of the easier out of the three, if you like, and with the conditions as they were today, it was obviously playing pretty tough.   
I gave myself quite a few chances, considering how tough it was playing, so I was happy with how I hit it.  I just struggled on the greens a little bit, but overall, pretty happy with the first two days.   
 Q.  Must have enjoyed playing with Brian O'Driscoll and Jamie Dornan, good company and famous guys?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Exactly, we got good crowds following us for obvious reasons, definitely not for me, no one knows who I am.  But no, it's been good fun and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  St. Andrews is always great, isn't it.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Definitely, Home of Golf, it's got a special feeling about it and hopefully the weather is coming to us.
