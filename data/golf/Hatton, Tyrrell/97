 Q.  Another solid round of golf.  Your thoughts?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Fairly happy with the score.  Although a little bit disappointed with how I putted on the back nine.  Gave myself a few opportunities but I missed quite a lot of putts on the back nine.  So it was fairly frustrating, and in a decent position heading into the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you feel under the radar?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Don't know.   
 Q.  Do you like that?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I'm only three back, so hopefully I can put two good rounds together Saturday and Sunday and have a chance.   
 Q.  Highlights of today's round?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Probably the chip-in on 3.  Quite a difficult chip, so that's really the best shot of the day.  Second into 18 was pretty close up there, as well.   
 Q.  I guess the birdie on 18 gives you momentum going into tomorrow?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, if I had holed the eagle putt, which was about 5-foot away, then you know, I'd have a bit more momentum.  But I'm pretty happy with the score.  And I guess like I said yesterday, my preparation wasn't that great or coming in or feel particularly confident.  So to be in the position that I'm in, I'm very happy with.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be on a world-class leaderboard?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, confident from my last year and like I said earlier, hopefully have a good weekend.
