Q Tyrrell, when we poke halfway through the round, you were 5-under through nine and obviously delighted with they with you were playing, ended with a 64, 8-under par.  Give us your verdict on that one now.
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, looking back I'm pretty happy with that round of golf to be honest.  Going out today the goal was to try to make the cut after yesterday's disappointing start.  So I'm really happy that I'm going to be here for the weekend.  Hoping that I can push on now and see where we go.
Q As you say the goal was to go out there and make the cut, once you got 8-under through 13, it was fairly obvious you were going to; did the goal change?  Were you thinking about course record, 61, Ernie Els, just maybe?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it was nice to be 8-under through 13, got quite fortunate with especially the birdie on 13.  Just a bit of a bonus that one going in.
And then 14 was pretty tough to take.  It was a poor tee shot.  You don't kind of expect to be plugged with a 3-wood but it is what it is, and a little bit disappointed I didn't birdie 17 or 18, but I can't really complain with 64.
Q Thoughts going into the weekend this position?  Ground to make up but in great form today.
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I think tomorrow is probably going to be an advantage going out a little earlier.  The greens will be smoother.  Having said that, I holed quite a few putts today.
But to be honest I think it's one of those days where you're better off putting from 15, 20 feet than being in amongst the five, six feet range and closer, because at least then you can kind of give it a little bit of a roll and it's got some momentum.  We'll see how we get on.
