TYRRELL HATTON: Just a scrappy day for both of us really.  Both made mistakes and the momentum sort of switched hands a few times.  I'm pretty happy to get the win my first time here.   
 Q.  Your performance over the last four to five months has been breathtaking around the world.  What's changed for you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I really don't know.  It's just hard to put a finger on it.  It's just been I guess really consistent and my game has been really solid.  Hopefully I can keep going with that.   
 Q.  There's nothing you can identify that's turned this all around?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Not really.  It's hard.  My caddie has been doing a great job for me.  Game has been really solid, so it's just that.
