 Q.  Talk me through your day.  How did it feel out there?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously it was a decent round.  A little bit frustrating at times.  Obviously it was annoying to leave that putt short on 18.  I had three putts today that were straight downhill and felt it was impossible to leave them short and left three of them short.   
But, you know, it's been a fantastic week.  Starting Saturday morning, I was plus one for the tournament, so if you had told me I'd finish tied third, I probably would have been quite surprised.  But no, really happy.   
 Q.  As you said, so many positives out there.  Looking at your scorecard, so many birdies and good scores out there.  What have you done really well and what are you taking away from this week?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I think my iron play has been pretty solid.  I actually felt it wasn't a particularly great week with the putter.  But that's positives to take that you know I can have a really good finish in a big tournament like this and not feel that I've putted particularly great.  I'm obviously quite happy with that.   
 Q.  Another week where there's plenty of ranking points and that sort of stuff.  You have to feel positive about this season.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's been an incredible eight months for me.  I'm really happy with how this season started, and hopefully I can continue the good form.
