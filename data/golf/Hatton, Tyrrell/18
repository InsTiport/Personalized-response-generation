  Q. Wonderful start, 36-hole total, only two bogeys.  What's pleased you most about the first two days?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Well, I've driven the ball pretty good.  I've not missed too many fairways, which I think is quite key out there.  Even though the rough's not that long, it's so wet, it's just pretty miserable to play out of.  It just doesn't go anywhere.  I need to keep that going over the weekend and see how we go.
 Q. Talk us through the last four holes, three birdies, and it's cold out there.  You must have played some good golf?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   It is nice to chip-in on 15.  That was a bonus.  And then 17, 18, you always feel like you've got to stay patient out there because there are chances coming in.  Yeah, it was nice to give myself chances.  On 18, we had, I think it was 203 to the front and a 4-iron -- 4-iron only carries around 218 and it pitched a couple of yards short, so it kind of shows how the ball is not traveling as it gets cold and miserable this evening.
 Q. Now the hoodie has become a bit of a media sensation.  Has it become a lucky charm for you?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   It's working so far this week.  It's comfortable to play in and it's nice and stretchy, so there's no issues with lack of movement.
 Q. You're a Rolex Series double champion.  Do you have one eye on this week, but also on the final prize in Dubai, knowing there's so many more points available?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   To be honest, no.  I'm focusing on golf here and trying to play my best each day.  It's been amazing to win two of them so far in my career and hopefully I can add more.  I'll certainly try my best to do so, but just got to see what happens.
