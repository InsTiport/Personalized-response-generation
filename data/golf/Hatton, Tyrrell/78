Q. How would you sum up today's round?
TYRRELL HATTON: I would say it was a very frustrating day.  I didn't actually play too badly.  I had so many awkward numbers.  When you're right in between club clubs, sometimes it's hard to get close to the hole.  It's even more of a frustrating finish over the last sort of four or five holes.  I didn't really do anything wrong to make bogey on, was it 15.  Just a bad lie in the rough.  Thought I hit a good chip and a good putt and lipped-out.
You know, I didn't hole any putts today.  I found it really difficult.  The ball just wouldn't stay on line.  There's so many footprints, and obviously the course is wet and hasn't taken the rain too well.  You know, it's a struggle when you're last out.
You know, hopefully I'll get a bit of luck tomorrow.  I feel like I didn't get anything today.  So yeah, it's just one of those days, unfortunately.
Q. You won't be in the last group tomorrow, so maybe that might take a little pressure off you.  Might be a bit more free tomorrow?
TYRRELL HATTON: Doesn't really matter either way.  Obviously trying to do your best in this position trying to win.  I'm certainly not out of the tournament, so it's not the end of the world.  But you know, I'm just so disappointed how that's finished today.  I feel like I didn't deserve that score.  I think if I look through my round again, I feel like it could easily be four shots better.
I've signed for a 1-over today, and unfortunately just have to take it on the chin.
Q. So you're saying there's much more positives today?
TYRRELL HATTON: If I look back at it, I don't think I've played too badly.  It's just I haven't holed a putt.  So you know, if you're not holing a putt, you literally can't score any worse, and that's how I felt today.
