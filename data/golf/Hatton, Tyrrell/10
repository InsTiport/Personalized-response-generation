  Q. 5-under for the day before you had to come off, how pleased are you with the way you're playing?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I'm obviously in a great position at the moment.  It was certainly tough out there, so I'm really happy to be 5-under.  Held some nice putts and there was a couple par putts toward the end of my round, nice to hold them and keep a bit of momentum going.
 Q. How good has your putting been this week?  Over the last few days seems like that hard work has been paying off.
 TYRRELL HATTON:   To be honest, no.  I haven't actually done much short game.  It's been weird.  Like the last sort of three weeks I've been hitting balls again, I was mainly focusing on long game.  It's a little bit of a surprise to see my short game as good as it has been last two days but obviously I need that to continue over the next however many holes we've got left.  Yeah, very pleased.
 Q. Tomorrow is going to be a slightly longer day, so you're going to have to finish today's round.  What's the one thing you need to focus on tomorrow to get the most out of your day?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Well, it's not going to be too bad I think because what have we got, four, five holes left to play tomorrow morning.  It's going to be a bit of a long wait potentially if I finish nicely tomorrow morning before I go out for round three.  But it will be fine.  I'll just try and stay loose and see how we go.
