Q. A round of 69, out in 36, level par, back in 3-under 33.  Did your play change or your fortunes change?  What happened?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I actually started hitting the fairway, which was quite nice.  It was a bit of a struggle on the front nine.  It's hard to play this golf course from the rough, and thankfully I managed to hit more fairways on the back nine and was able to be a little bit more aggressive.  At the end of the day kind of happy with 69.
Q. Were you working on the theory at the 18th with your third shot that trees are 90 per cent air, because it didn't look like a very big gap you were aiming at.
TYRRELL HATTON:   Well, there wasn't really a gap, but I just couldn't be bothered to chip out sideways, and I just wanted to hit a -- I hit a 6-iron, but it popped up a little bit.  There was a tree root about a foot in front of the ball and I was kind of worried about hitting that, so naturally I would have liked to have hit a 5-iron and hit it really low, and I think it would have been fine because I did see a small enough gap there that I thought it was achievable, but obviously didn't have the skills to pull it off on that occasion.
Q. Your 150th start on the European Tour, five wins, 15 top 3s, 40 million Euros in prize money.  Happy with that?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Nice numbers.  It's not something I obviously think about, so hopefully I have plenty more starts ahead of me and keep improving.
