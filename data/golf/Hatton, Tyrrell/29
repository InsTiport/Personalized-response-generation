Q. 69-68-66, gradual improvement through three rounds. Give us your reflections on today's score.
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously it was a good day. Got off to a nice start. I think I was 5-under through 7. Just a key patch through the middle of my round which was a little bit disappointing, but overall pretty happy with how I played, and it's nice to kind of be doing as well as I am my first tournament back in almost three months.
Q. Talk us through that fast start and what it did for momentum.
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, it was just the birdies at 1 and 2, it was just the perfect start, and then holed a couple of good putts on the rest of the front nine and that was kind of a build of momentum. Lost a little bit of momentum with bogeys at 8 and 10, but happy with picking up a few shots over the last few holes.
Q. Just talk us through those birdies on the back nine.
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, birdie on 16 stands out where I chipped in from over the back of the green. That was obviously a bonus because you shouldn't be going long there anyway. I've been quite fortunate the last two days having two chip-ins.
Q. Going into tomorrow, is it absolutely frustrating to shoot 5-under and not make any ground on the leaders?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, you're just playing in a WGC with the best players in the world. There's scores out there if you can obviously control your ball, and obviously the leaders are doing that very well. But yeah, what am I, seven shots back, six shots back at the moment? It's a long way behind in 18 holes. I'm just going to go out tomorrow, try and play as well as I can, and hopefully I can shoot another good score.
Q. Overall pleased with your performance so far and looking forward to tomorrow?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely. Didn't really have high expectations coming into this week. Just wanted to see how my wrist felt in tournament golf. I've been practicing properly for the last three weeks, so my swing wasn't in a bad place, but until you're in competition you kind of don't know exactly where you're at, so I'm pretty happy with the last three days, and hopefully I can play well again tomorrow.
