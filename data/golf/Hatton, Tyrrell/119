Q.   Tell me about the day, obviously didn't get off to the best start but you must be pleased how you bounced back? 
TYRELL HATTON:   Obviously a rough start, but just sort of kept plugging away.   Things weren't sort of going my way in the first sort of seven holes.   But yeah, just kept at it and made a couple birdies coming in and made a decent score after that start.

Q.   How did it all happen on the second? 
TYRELL HATTON:   A little bit greedy.   I hit it left off the tee into the desert and tried to hit a low hooking one down the fairway.   Hit it low but didn't get any hooks.   I was across the desert the other side and then again got greedy. 
Tried to hit a 4‑iron through the front of the green through the trees.   Blocked it right into I think the ice plant is what they call it over here, so I had to take an unplayable, drop it in the desert, plugged, play out sideways and on the green, 2‑putt.   It was crowd pleasing 8, I have to say.

Q.   Sometimes that sort of stuff can frazzle your mind a bit, but also can like sort of free you up to sort of go the rest of the round, which is I guess what happened today. 
TYRELL HATTON:   My swing didn't feel as good as yesterday.   Obviously that start wasn't ideal but I kept giving myself chances.   And then eventually I took them, so that was the key.

Q.   Martin is in front now but still in good position with everyone to try and chase if he doesn't push on?
TYRELL HATTON:   I'm six back going into the weekend.   You know, six shots isn't a lot, but obviously Martin is pretty good around this golf course.   I need a couple of low one, imagine, just have to see. 

Q.   I take it in the end that score is very pleasing, isn't it?
TYRELL HATTON:   Yeah, definitely, making triple on my second hole is not ideal.   But played pretty well after that.   To finish under after that start, very happy.

Q.   When something like that happens, you would be forgiven for feeling so deflated but presumably so much of the round left to play?
TYRELL HATTON:   16 holes left, so have plenty of time to recover that and thankfully I did.

Q.   There were times last year, people criticized you for your attitude on the course; no throwing of the clubs or anything like that, staying patient? 
TYRELL HATTON:   I tried my best.   Caddie said I did a good job today.   I worked hard out there and happy with the score. 

Q.   Looks like you're doing a good job all told.   I appreciate the leader has moved a bit clear, but it's a fine position, isn't it, after two days?
TYRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I did well last year, and I'm happy with where I am.   We'll just see how the weekend goes.

Q.   Any difference from playing in the morning compared to the first afternoon? 
TYRELL HATTON:   I think the ball just goes a little bit shorter in the morning.   So just have to adjust yourself there.   Greens are slightly better in the morning and still pretty good in the afternoon. 

Q.   On the first day you were talking about fitness and diet.   Did you have that burger? 
TYRELL HATTON:   I did, yeah.   I had the beef sliders and then finished it off with a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. 

Q.   Sounds healthy enough. 
TYRELL HATTON:   You have to treat yourself, haven't you.
