  Q. Nice finish.  10-shot difference from yesterday.  What was the cause of the turnaround for you late?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   I don't know.  I mean, I struggled yesterday.  I think I lost four and a half shots on the greens and I didn't feel like I putted that bad.  I just didn't feel like there was any holes out there for me.
 I was struggling today, but I was grinding, I really wanted to make the cut, defending this week, I wanted to be here for the weekend.  Obviously, the chip-in on 14 -- was it 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, that kind of got me going and it was nice to birdie four in a row.
 Q. How do you keep it going heading into the weekend on such a positive note?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Well, we'll just see.  Like I said, my game hasn't felt great, so hoping that I can kind of find something when I wake up tomorrow morning.
 Q. What's the memories been like?  We talked earlier in the week but now when you get back out there in this tournament that you won a year ago, is that helpful at all when you try to at least realize what you did a year ago?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I mean, I take confidence from the fact that obviously we had a great week here last year.  Have to say, it is nice playing in front of crowds again, having an atmosphere and stuff like that.  So I feel like that kind of helped as well today.  Yeah, I need some low scores over the weekend and I'll certainly be trying my best to do that.
