 Q.  Reckon you could bottle up that first four holes and the finish.  That was pretty good, wasn't it?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, obviously got off to a really good start which is nice.  Just didn't take advantage of 10, which is frustrating.  Then make a really good birdie on 12, and 13 kind of took all the way -- well, took the momentum away completely, which was really frustrating.  I didn't really hit too bad a shot in, just slightly right, and tried its best to go in the water and it did and then didn't get up-and-down and made bogey.   
Then, yeah, it was hard.  I was quite frustrated from that point and obviously a 3-putt on 15 made it worse.  So it was nice to see that long one drop on 18.  Sort of make me feel a bit happier coming off the course.   
 Q.  What were you thinking after that start?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I knew the scoring was going to be low today.  Obviously it's not too windy and previous two days shows that there's a score out there.  Obviously gave myself a great chance to go really low, 5-under through eight.  Obviously 6-under is still a decent score, but I certainly feel like I've left a few out there today.   
 Q.  Is that slightly frustrating, bearing in mind the scoring has been so low on the back nine?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I guess so.  Have to wait and see what happens with the leaders, but I think at the moment, I'm four shots behind.  Only got a couple of par 5s to play and stuff.  Need a really low one tomorrow if I'm going to have any chance.   
It was nice to play how I did today after yesterday.  Kind of lost all rhythm and stuff, so it was nice to kind of get that back.  Hopefully I can take that into tomorrow.   
 Q.  What do you feel you need at this stage?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, it's hard to say.  It all depends what the leaders do tomorrow, and if scoring is the same, off the top of my head, I'm probably going to say like 10-under.  You know scoring is going to be low tomorrow if it's the same conditions, so we'll just have to see.   
 Q.  Great way to finish.  Just talk us through that.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, just trickled through into the semi so it felt like a slightly awkward second shot.  I think it was 234 or 237 to the pin, wind slightly into out of the right.  Just hit 3-wood and came out perfect, really.  Just a nice, high, soft fade.  Wind was into out of the right so it just held it up a bit and it was about 45-, 50-foot putt, so it was nice to see that one go straight in the middle.
