Q. Conditions were a little bit different today than they had been earlier in the week.  Not as much wind.  Do you feel like you can be more aggressive out on the golf course?
TYRRELL HATTON: I think scoring is always pretty low here.  Yeah, there were birdies to be had, and the greens seemed quicker than what they were on Monday.  I struggle with the pace of them but overall, a good day.
Q. Bunched leaderboard.  Seems like that happens every year.  What is it about this golf course that seems to bring everyone together?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, there's a lot of opportunity.  I think there's only one par 5 where you are struggling to reach in two.  The par 4s, you've got good chances there.  And everyone's is a good player.  Scoring is low.  Scoring is going to be pretty bunched.
Q. You had some big success this year on The European Tour. How much confidence do you have going into these last three events?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, obviously I take confidence from the wins but after a few days off, my week off after Italy, I kind of lost all the feelings I had with my swing.  So I'm trying to find them again.  China was a little bit of a struggle, although we finished tied 11th.
So if I can feel more comfortable, then I should have a good run to the end of the year.
