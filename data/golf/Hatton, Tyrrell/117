 Q.  Your reaction to your finish?  TYRRELL HATTON: Fairly disappointed, actually.  Played really well out there.  Back nine was quite difficult.  17 is still a bit of a sore one, but 2 under is my best score in a major, so there's some positives there, so hopefully I can have a good day tomorrow and go from there.   Q.  Everybody is talking about 17.  Just talk about that hole.  TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, difficult.   Q.  You're obviously taking a lot of positives out of today?  TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, that's what I've got to try and do.  As I said, I did play pretty well today, so hopefully I'll keep that form going tomorrow.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  TYRRELL HATTON: Well, it's always good to play with someone who's playing well.  You kind of get a bit of momentum off it, I guess.  Unfortunately for him, he didn't have a great finish, either.  But he played well today, and I'm sure hopefully we both do well tomorrow.   Q.  What happened to you on 17?  TYRRELL HATTON: I hit it slightly left off the tee.  Everyone is hitting it left down there today, I think, especially with the wind direction.  I had what I sort was a decent lie in the rough and tried to get it up close to the green and club sort of snagged a little.  It was 80 yards short in the thick rough, played a great shot to the back of the green and rolled it down there to two feet and hit a good putt, hits a spike mark and lips out and made double.  Yeah, that kind of knocked the wind out of my sails.  And 18, I wasn't very happy.   Q.  Compare this to your experience here five years ago?  TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, last time was a different experience.  Got pretty unlucky with the draw.  Today was a lot easier than 2010, but the back nine was difficult today.
