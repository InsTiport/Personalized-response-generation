BRIONY CARLYON: Delighted to be here with our defending champion, Tyrrell Hatton.  Thanks for joining us.
Let's take a step back to The Ryder Cup last week and being part of that victorious team.  How special was that for you?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was obviously a very special week.  Memories that will last a lifetime, but yeah, from the start of the week, we knew it was going to be very special.  There was fantastic team chemistry from the start.  Thankfully we managed to get the job done.
BRIONY CARLYON: Coming to this week now, though, you must be full of confidence.  You won here the past two years.  So you obviously enjoy the format, a bit more of a relaxed atmosphere and playing of course the three courses.  What do you love about this event?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's definitely more relaxed than other weeks, which I guess helps me.  I enjoy the golf courses and obviously winning here the previous two years, it's great to be back.  I feel like my game is in a good place.  I'll be trying my best this week to make it three in a row.  I'll have to see what happens, but I don't feel too bad after Sunday's celebrations.
Q. Is there any reason why you can't make it a third time to get your hat trick, as it were?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, I don't see why I can't.  Obviously like I just said, I feel like my game is in a good place.  So I'll certainly be trying my best to win this week.  All I can do is try my best, so just have to see what happens.
Q. You won't have Jamie Dornan this year.
TYRRELL HATTON: We've had good fun the last two years.   Obviously he's quite busy at the moment, so he can't play this year.  But playing with Ruud Gullit, it's going to be great.  We should have hopefully good fun over the four days, and yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  It's a special week.  Just try and enjoy it.
Q. Speaking of fun, what was the best moment on Sunday night?
TYRRELL HATTON: All of it was pretty good to be honest.  It was a pretty good party.
Q. The video the team was shown, the motivational video.  Can you tell us about your feelings when you watched that and how it motivated you personally?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I think everyone had a bit of a lump in their throat.  Some of the guys were -- it hit home.  It was hard not to we will up a bit watching.  For me personally, it's a great video.  You just can't wait to get out there and just give it your all.  That's all you can do.  It's a special video they made for us.
There was a quote in there, that said "wear them down with excellence," which is a good quote, I guess you could say at the end of the week, that we did.  I guess you could say at the end of the week, that we did.
Q. I guess The Ryder Cup was shrouded slightly by the unfortunate incident with Brooks Koepka and the spectator.  There's been calls from some people that perhaps it's time for a review of spectator safety or access at these events.  What's your take on that?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's obviously very sad news, what's happened.  You know, you wouldn't want that to happen to anyone.  Obviously they have just come out here to support the guys, enjoy a good day, and it's very unfortunate that's happened.  I guess if you shouted "fore" and you're pointing, as a player, you're trying not to miss the fairway, but as a player, if you've shouted "fore," there's not much more we can do there I guess.
Q. Do you think the spectators perhaps get too close to the action?
TYRRELL HATTON: I didn't think they were too close last week to be honest.  There was obviously a little bit of room there, but we are going to hit bad shots.  It's just -- everyone does, and it's just unfortunate that that week, there's so many people and there's only four matches.  So everyone's really close.  There's not really anywhere else to go, and you want to be there.
It's just, I don't know what else to say on that.  It's just unfortunate.
Q. There is a lot of team competition in sport.  What do you think about World Cup of Golf?
TYRRELL HATTON: I'm looking forward to playing the World Cup this year.  It's me and Ian Poulter, going to go down to Australia.  That should be good fun.  Obviously it's great to represent your country in any sport, and golf's no different.
Q. Do you feel the best is yet to come, and being part of that team last week, just inspires you to get better and better?
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, hopefully.  I'll certainly try my best to be on the team in two years' time.  The guys said last week, once you play one Ryder Cup, that you never want to miss the team again, and I'll certainly be no different from that.  I actually loved last week, being part of the team is very special.
Like I said, yeah, hopefully I'll be there in two years' time.  I can only try my best each week.  You never know what's around the corner with golf.  That's all you can do, try your best and see what happens.
Q. What makes St Andrews such a special place and why do you keep coming back?
TYRRELL HATTON: It's a special place.  It's got a certain feeling about it, standing on that first tee.  You hope you don't miss the fairway.
It's just great to be back.  It's the Home of Golf, and we get to play two other great courses, as well.
Q. Just a little bit more about the World Cup.  Do you have some excitement for this competition after Ryder Cup?
TYRRELL HATTON: I think obviously there's excitement to play the World Cup, otherwise you wouldn't go.
Q. Why not the same as The Ryder Cup?
TYRRELL HATTON: I think with the history of The Ryder Cup, and how big of an event it is; obviously the World Cup is a massive event, as well, but there's so many things going on Ryder Cup week, and the qualifying takes a year to make that team for The Ryder Cup.
Obviously the World Cup is still special.  You still want to go down there and win, and that's what Ian and me will try to do.
BRIONY CARLYON: Thank you for your time.
