 Q.  How much are you looking forward to teeing it up in a Ryder Cup?  
PAUL CASEY: I can't wait.  It's going to be this man's debut tomorrow.  I'm so excited for it.  He's playing great.   
How do you feel?   
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously it's going to be an incredible atmosphere tomorrow morning.  So hopefully we can play well and win a point for Europe.   
 Q.  We saw you both on 13 today.  You were in the very thick rough and you were just in the semi-rough.  Just shows it has to be avoided off the tee on this golf course?  
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, but we won our match today, so it was all good (laughing).   
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, we took the money today.  Obviously it's important to hit fairways around here.  The rough is very thick, so hopefully we can be in the fairway quite often tomorrow.   
 Q.  How excited to get this Ryder Cup underway in this pairing together?  
PAUL CASEY: I can't wait.  Tyrrell is phenomenal.  We paired up earlier this year.  We've had success so far this week.  We beat Sergio and Alex today.  I mean, this is going to be an amazing week.  It's really been fantastic to this point.  I'm excited for this man to make his debut tomorrow and see what it's all about, and then he'll be a Ryder Cupper.  We're playing great golf, and I have confidence in our team.   
 Q.  How excited are you to finally get this thing going for yourself?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Obviously I can't wait.  The atmosphere on the first tee tomorrow is going to be unbelievable.  Certainly an experience, and you know, I can't wait to get started.
