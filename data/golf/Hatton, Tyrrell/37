TYRRELL HATTON: Played some good golf again today.  Obviously really happy with 2-under, and hopefully that stays inside the top-10.  I think top-10 gets you in next year, which is good, because I've been stuck in reverse going down the World Rankings.  So it would be nice to guarantee a major next year.
Q. In terms of playing in those conditions, how positive does it make you when you dig in?
TYRRELL HATTON: The back nine was tough.  Just the wind anyway.  And obviously the rain really come down on 18 when we stood in the fairway.  I guess we got a little bit lucky.
The leaders are going to struggle on the back nine.  If it stays like that it will be carnage.  But it's certainly a test.
Q. So a test of the crowds out there, as well.
TYRRELL HATTON: It's amazing.  Obviously a packed grandstand and everyone under their umbrellas.  The crowds have been amazing all week, the support they've given every player has been great.
I've really enjoyed the week.
Q. Obviously you've played in a few Opens, where does this rank for you?
TYRRELL HATTON: The atmosphere, this has been the best one.  Like I said, it's been great from start to finish.  And hopefully we'll be coming back.
Q. What's coming up for you now golf-wise?
TYRRELL HATTON: Play Memphis next week, then have a week off, and then start the FedEx.  Hopefully I can get through -- I'm 94th on the FedEx at the moment going into this week.  If I can stay inside top-10 there will be some good points there.
Ideally I'd like to get through to the second FedEx and then I won't be playing until Wentworth, get a nice break there and go on holiday in that time, which I can't wait for.  Hopefully that sets me up for a good finish of the season.
Q. Get some warmth and sunshine in Memphis.
TYRRELL HATTON: It will be polar opposite to right now.  I'm going home for a couple of days, so get to repack and will be packing shorts.
Q. Obviously at the moment we don't know who will win.  Assuming Shane Lowry, your thoughts on him and him as a person?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, me and my caddie, we were saying if it was Shane or Tommy, we would be delighted.  If it is Shane, obviously he's got a lot of support out there and he's a nice guy.  We get on well.
Either way it would be a great winner.
