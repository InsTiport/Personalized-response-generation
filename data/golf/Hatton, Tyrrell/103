 Q.  Happy birthday to you.  That a nice way to mark it?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Thank you very much.  Yeah, obviously happy with the score.  I didn't feel like I played that well today but the putter helped me out a lot.  Hopefully I can play a bit better tomorrow and keep the putts dropping.   
 Q.  Is that part and parcel of playing well and the confidence that you can get something, the best out of it on a day?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I guess so.  Coming off a high last week, you know, just trying to grind out a decent score when I'm not playing well and I managed to do that today.   
 Q.  Did you notice a difference in conditions?  It got a bit easy for you in the afternoon.  
TYRRELL HATTON: It actually wasn't too bad.  I thought it was similar to yesterday when we finished.  The course is still playing in really good condition.  It's good out there.   
 Q.  I never touched on this yesterday but the very fact you're playing with Lee Westwood and champion Matt Fitzpatrick; do you notice the support?  
TYRRELL HATTON: The crowds are fantastic, and I'm sure they will be great over the weekend.  Tournaments are so well supported in the U.K. and it's great to see.   
 Q.  Have you been recognized?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, like you say, I've got my family and my girlfriend and her family, so I've got quite a bit of support and we've got more family coming over the weekend.  Should be good.   
 Q.  Anyone from school saying, I was in class with you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: No, I haven't seen any school friends, but that's okay.   
 Q.  What are the plans tonight?  Have you got any to mark your birthday?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I've got friends and family coming over to the house and I'm going to order a lot of pizza.  Look forward to that.   
 Q.  Champions food of choice?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Oh, yeah.  Athlete's diet.
