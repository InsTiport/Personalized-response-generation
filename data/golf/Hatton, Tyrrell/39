 Q.  Talk us through that impressive-looking 66?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, I've got my putter to thank, really. I haven't been hitting it well at all. It was just nice to hole some putts. Yeah, I'm very happy with that score.   
 Q.  You're a two-time champion of this tournament. What is it about this tournament you enjoy so much?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I just feel comfortable on all three courses and I guess this time of year, I play well, so it's always at a good time for me. I didn't play that well today. I scored well.   
Hopefully I can hit it better in the next three days and keep holing putts.   
 Q.  A little on the format, how much of a unique event is it playing with the amateurs this week?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's good. It's good fun. Obviously the course setup is a little easier than what we'd normally have, but obviously it's different to any other week, and I think all the guys enjoy it.
