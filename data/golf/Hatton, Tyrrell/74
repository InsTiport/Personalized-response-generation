 Q.  A birdie, birdie, birdie finish for 64.  Just how happy did that make you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was obviously a nice finish.  I was getting pretty frustrated out there.  I guess after 15, sort of, like I said, I was getting frustrated but kind of fired myself up a bit and a really good finish in the end.   
 Q.  Do you use anger as motivation?  We see you get upset and then respond with a hatful of birdies.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I guess it helps me.  No one enjoys being angry.  But I guess it helped me today.  I was trying my hardest and it wasn't quite working for -- even though I had a good score going, I felt like it should have been better, and I guess that frustrated me more today than other days it might have.   
No, it's just, I guess I've used my anger today to help me to a good round.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your position in the championship now, four behind a couple of joint leaders?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's a decent position going into the weekend.  Game feels pretty good.  Yesterday I felt kind of tired and didn't really play too well but managed to score well.   
So yeah, you know, it's a good position to be in and hopefully I can have a good weekend.   
It was a really good finish and obviously a really good score but I found myself getting quite frustrated out there and guess I gave myself a good talking to walking off 15.  Really happy with that finish and looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  What disappointed you walking off 15?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I just felt like I struggled with the pace today, apart from the final three holes.  I left a lot of putts short, and I had a couple of uphill putts on the back nine, I think on 12 and 15, and hit them both seven foot past.   
Obviously quite frustrating and ended up 3-putting 15, which wasn't ideal.  But no, a good finish and take some confidence into the weekend.   
 Q.  A 65, obviously made ground on the field.  You must be pleased with that, bearing in mind the position.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, if you told me at the start of the day I was going to shoot 7-under, obviously I would be really happy.  I think I need at least another two of those to have a chance on Sunday.  Scoring is pretty good around here, so I'll try my best to do that.   
 Q.  How are you feeling after last week?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Felt pretty tired yesterday to be honest but managed to score pretty well considering how I kind of played and felt.  Felt a bit fresher today.  I think the three-and-a-half-hour snooze yesterday afternoon helped with that.  But no, I feel fine now, so hopefully I can have a strong weekend.
