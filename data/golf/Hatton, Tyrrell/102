 Q.  As the champion from last week and a nice Top-10 finish, what are your thoughts?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Pretty happy with the week.  I didn't feel like I played that great the first two days.  I played a lot better at the weekend.  But struggled on the greens.  So you know, overall it was a good week, but feel like I could have done a bit better.   
 Q.  Going into today, did you think there was still a chance?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Possibly.  I would had to have shot 10-under again but couldn't manage that again.   
Winning last week, takes quite a bit out of you, so looks forward to a bit of rest.  I've only got a couple of days off, but it will be nice and I'm actually flying out to Dubai on Friday to do a bit of practice.  It's a really good place to practice and it will be slightly warmer than it is here in the UK, so should help my preparations going into The Final Series.   
 Q.  A lot to look forward to with the Final Series; you can play every week if you choose?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it should be good fun.  Still yet to decide as what to do with the schedule and final four, but as it stands I'm down to play four.   
 Q.  Order of Merit on your mind?  
TYRRELL HATTON: No, not at all.  Just trying to play as well as I can and climb up the World Rankings.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on this championship and the way it's been received, enjoyed all that?  
TYRRELL HATTON: It's been a great week.  Been really well supported in the crowds and it's just such a good atmosphere.  Looking forward to the British Masters next year.
