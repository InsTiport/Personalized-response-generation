 Q.  How are you feeling?  
TYRRELL HATTON: It's hard to put into words. It's just been a crazy day. Obviously the playoff was mental, and I'm just so happy to win again. Hard to put into words.   
I said to my team that if I was lucky enough to win again, then I definitely would enjoy it more. I think it's easy to take for granted, and I mean that in the best terms possible. But yeah, it's incredible to get my fourth win on The European Tour and obviously that wraps up the Masters for next year, as well, which was definitely on my mind coming into the tournament and I knew I only had two events left in my schedule, so delighted to win and obviously wrap that up.   
 Q.  You said you were looking for a good week this week. Massive win. Going forward, how good is that?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, incredible. I'm really excited for my week off now next week, and obviously spend time with family and friends and enjoy that, and then going to head out to Dubai a little early and get comfortable out there, and hopefully have another good week to end the season.
