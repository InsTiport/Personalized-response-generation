 Q.  What happened in the middle of that match that switched everything around for you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, I think the momentum definitely swung in my favor from the 8th onwards.  I made it tough on myself early on, gifted a couple of holes today, which isn't ideal.  Conditions are really tough today.  The last thing you want to do is give holes away.   
So I did that early on, but I was very happy the way I came back.  I played really good the last ten holes.  That 3-wood that I just hit on 16 was probably the best 3-wood I have hit in my life.  So very happy with that finish.   
 Q.  Not sure I have ever seen you smile so much.  So when you are riding a wave of momentum like you were the last ten or so holes, what's that like inside for you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Well, it's tough on days like this.  You don't know what's around the corner.  You are always trying to hit good shots.  But a gust of wind or whatever and you can miss it in the wrong spot.   
Luckily I kind of got some breaks on the last ten holes which I feel like I didn't quite get in the first seven.  So very happy to get the win and looking forward to tomorrow now.
