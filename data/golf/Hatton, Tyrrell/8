Q. First hole of 2021 kick-started with an eagle.
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, obviously two good shots.  It's not often you're hitting 3-wood to five feet and a nice one to start the day.
Q. Made another one on 9 and signed for a bogey-free 7-under.  Must be happy with that start?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, I'm really happy with that.  I think I got away with it, ten holes, I hit one fairway, so that wasn't ideal.  The wind certainly picked up as the round went on, which I think the guys going out this afternoon, it's going to be a lot tougher for them.  Obviously I can only play with what's in front of me and I'm happy with the job I managed to do on the end.
Q. 5-under on the par 5s, is that going to get the job done this week?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Depending on the wind direction, if you can take advantage of them, you to need to do that.  Like I said I was able to do that today and hopefully I can do that over the next few days.
Q. What can you build on for the rest of the tournament?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Just nice momentum, shooting a good score in round one, so you can't win the tournament today or through to Saturday, but obviously it's a nice start.
Q. Pleased to be back and playing on The European Tour again?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it's good.  2020 I wasn't able to do it that much, but it's nice to be around familiar faces again and looking forward to the next few weeks.
