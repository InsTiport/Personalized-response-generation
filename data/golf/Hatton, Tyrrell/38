 Q.  A 68 to match with your 66, Carnoustie yesterday. Are you happy with that?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yes and no. Obviously Kingsbarns and St. Andrews are where I want to make the scores. I don't feel like I played that well again today, because I got a few good breaks, especially on 15, the par 3. I landed in the lacks there and it shot across over to the back of the green. Obviously made up-and-down.   
I'm surprised I've only had one bogey over the first two days, as well, with how I feel like I've hit it. But even though I'm not happy with how I hit it today, I actually still have a lot of birdie opportunities, but I just struggled on the greens. They weren't as smooth as Carnoustie yesterday.   
 Q.  So it's all to play for, and your record around here is just incredible in this tournament. What is it about this Dunhill Links tournament that inspires you?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Just feel comfortable out there, really. I don't know, I'm comfortable on links courses. The setup is easier this week than other weeks that we play. I guess you can get away with the odd bad shot. I don't know if that helps me, but obviously it's working at the moment.   
 Q.  The current leader is playing St. Andrews and he's got to play Carnoustie tomorrow, and he's 14-under and you're 10. How do you assess your position?  
TYRRELL HATTON: We're in a good position at the moment. It's quite hard to judge, as well, with everyone playing different courses. We'll get a good indication tomorrow at the end of play. Hopefully I've posted another good score and all to play for on Sunday.
