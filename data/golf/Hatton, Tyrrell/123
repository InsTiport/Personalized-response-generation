Q.   Satisfied with that start?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Obviously very happy with that, my lowest round of the year, so it's a great start.

Q.   Everything worked? 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, a couple of bad chips.   I putted really well which was the key.   Been struggling with my putting recently.   So it's a bit of a surprise to putt well today but I'll take it.

Q.   On tricky greens, because they are not the easiest ones to read, are they. 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Well, I did okay on them.   I found them quite tricky at the start of the week but spent a bit of time on Tuesday and Wednesday, so hopefully I've got used to them now.
I hit a lot of really good iron shots and just gave myself plenty of opportunities and thankfully I took some of them.

Q.   Been a lovely year, hasn't it.   I don't know if you've given yourself time to reflect on what you've achieved. 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Maybe after Dubai.   Still work to do.

Q.   Certainly moving in the right direction, and you're in position to perhaps be Rookie of the Year, I don't know if that means much to you. 
TYRRELL HATTON:   Obviously it would be great to win that.   I think Brooks is ahead of me on that one at the moment but just have to see how the next two events go.

Q.   And you've highlighted these two events to get something really major out of them presumably?
TYRRELL HATTON:   Obviously for me, the hard work is kind of done now.   So just trying to enjoy the next two.   To get in The Race to Dubai in my rookie year is obviously amazing.   All I wanted at the start of the year was just to keep my card.   To be playing this week and next week, it's fantastic.   So I just look forward to that.

Q.   Sounds like you can free=wheel just that little bit. 
TYRRELL HATTON:   The start of the year you have the pressures of trying to keep your card, and no guarantees.   So just got to keep going.
