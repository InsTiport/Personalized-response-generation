Q. And another win.  You control your fate tomorrow.  It's easy to say a half point gets it done.  It's easier said than done, isn't it?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely.  It wasn't looking good through 7 holes.  I was 3-down.  I had a lot of work to do.  But I'm very happy with how I played the last nine, ten holes especially with the conditions.  It's pretty tough out here.  Very gusty.  To finish with an eagle there is great.
Q. I think one of fun things as an observer of match play, to see a make like that from Brendan Steele and forcing you to have to make it to close it out here?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's great.  It was pretty kind to me yesterday.  I holed one out to finish the match there.  And same again today.  Obviously I knew I needed to hole that one after Brendan had rolled in a long one.  Very happy to see that one drop.
Q. I saw you give him a smile, too, there.  Good sportsmanship.  That's what this game is about.
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, good sportsmanship and I think we did that today and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
