 Q.  Just talk about the day, obviously couple of birdies to finish has got you into tied for third.  Pretty good result.  I know it's not the one you were looking for, but.  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I think I'm tied 4th.  So I needed to finish tied 5th this week to get my temporary membership.  Although today was pretty disappointing in some ways, to get my temporary membership is really good.  So, looking forward to the rest of the year now and hopefully can gain status for next year.   
 Q.  Was that the main goal at the beginning of the week, that Top-5 finish?  
TYRRELL HATTON: I tried not to sort of think about it too much, but obviously when, after yesterday and got into the position I was in, I knew that if I played well today then I would probably get the temporary membership.  It turned out that I grinded out an acceptable score in pretty tough conditions, so no, I'm pretty happy now.   
 Q.  You had a front row seat for what Marc did.  What did you see down the stretch?  
TYRRELL HATTON: He putted lovely all day.  I don't think he missed anything inside 12 feet.  So yeah, it was just, he holed a lot of putts and fair play to him.
