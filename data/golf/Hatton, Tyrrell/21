  Q. Tyrrell, what was your attitude starting this championship knowing that you had to chase with 72 holes?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, it's obviously quite different to what we're normally used to, but I guess you've just got to go out there and try and be a little bit more aggressive.  I got off to a really nice start today, 4-under through 6, but sadly couldn't kind of keep momentum going, and I actually struggled with my swing quite a bit from that point, unfortunately.  Felt like I actually did well to grind out a 3-under in the end.
 Q. It's interesting you talk about being aggressive.  Do you feel like that's going to be your strategy throughout this championship, trying to go as north as much as you possibly can on the leaderboard?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   Yeah, if my swing allows me to do that.  Yeah, I was really struggling.  I missed so many fairways today.  It's going to be hard to shoot low numbers if you're not in the fairway.  Hopefully that's my kind of bad day out of the way and I can feel a little bit more comfortable tomorrow.  I feel really good on the greens, so I actually putted quite nicely today, so I take confidence from that, and hopefully I can play a bit better.
 Q. Getting back to what you were saying, something you want to get better at is finding the fairways, is that something you're still trying to figure out or is it just an execution issue?
 TYRRELL HATTON:   It's hard; obviously I haven't seen my dad who's my swing coach since he left just after THE PLAYERS Championship was canceled, so obviously that was middle of March.  There's obviously so much you can do with videos and stuff like that, but it's kind of difficult trying to figure it all out through FaceTime.  Obviously that's the new normal at the moment.  But hopefully just kind of get a good feeling in my swing.  My swing is quite simple so it's normally a relatively easy fix, it's just trying to find what that easy fix is, and then I'll be fine.
