Q. Pleased with that?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I thought it was a pretty tough day out there to be honest.  Obviously the front nine was worst wind that you can ask for, into off the left, and you kind of get the benefit when you make the turn on 12 and then you come in.
Overall, I'm pretty happy.  Felt like I left a couple of shots out there but it's not easy out in those conditions.  I think 4-under is a good score today.
Q. What was working really well in your game today?
TYRRELL HATTON: To be honest, I think I drove the ball pretty good.  I only hit it in one pot bunker, which was I think -- is it the fifth, the par 5.  So yeah, that was pretty good today.  I was able to give myself a few opportunities.
Q. So you bogeyed the 17th rode hole and straight back with a birdie on 18?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was obviously nice to finish with a birdie on the last.  17 is a bit frustrating.  Thought I hit a great second shot in, and was like a yard or two yards out.  Had a pretty difficult 2-putt.  So just, that's links golf, unfortunately, and kind of got to take it on the chin.  It's easier said than done sometimes, but no, happy with the finish and looking forward to playing Carnoustie tomorrow.
Q. And Carnoustie, a different challenge?
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, I'm hoping it's flat calm to be honest.  Yeah, Carnoustie is the toughest one, if it is really windy.  But whatever it is tomorrow, just got to try your best, and that's all you can do.
