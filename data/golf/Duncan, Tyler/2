 Q.  Tyler, how you would you assess your round out there today?  
TYLER DUNCAN: I played really solid. I got off to a good start, birdied the first two holes and then made a bogey and just kind of hung out for a little while and then birdied No. 9, kind of jump-start me going into the back nine.   
 Q.  Did you feel like the course was there kind of for the taking, not a lot of wind? Obviously you're getting out there early.  
TYLER DUNCAN: Yeah, it was. There wasn't much wind. The greens were receptive, and the greens are rolling -- as long as you're on the green, you feel like you can make it.   
 Q.  Did you kind of see this round coming? You've been playing pretty well.  
TYLER DUNCAN: I feel like I've been playing pretty well, yeah. I've played decent the last two weeks, kind of just one round hasn't been great and set me back, but I feel like I've been trending in the right direction and happy to play well.
