Q. What a start today.  I know it's hard to keep the pedal all to the way to the metal, but that's a good FedExCup points boost for you today.
TYLER DUNCAN: Thank you.  I needed it.
Q. Standing on 12 tee, 8-under through the first 11.  What's going through your mind?
TYLER DUNCAN: There is a pretty tough pin on 12, so we were just trying to get a good look on 12.  Knew I was going to have a bunch of looks coming in and just trying to stay positive and just focus on making birdies.
Q. The golf course for the leaders - they're going to get out here in a little bit - is it still firm?  How are the greens?  What do you think we'll see later this afternoon?
TYLER DUNCAN: I played early yesterday and the greens were much softer yesterday morning than today.  I think they'll be a little firmer and faster this afternoon than they were yesterday.
Q. Out with Adam Schenck later today.  You guys play each and every year at the Zurich Classic.  Couple of boilermakers.  Big smile on your face right now.  It's big day for him.  What are you thinking?
TYLER DUNCAN: I think he's going to have a great day.  We had a nice dinner last night together, and hopefully he gets some of that mojo that I had.
