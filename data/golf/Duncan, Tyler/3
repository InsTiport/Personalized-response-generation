 Q.  What was the best part of your game do you think?  
TYLER DUNCAN: I was pretty much hitting it where I wanted to, so it's hard to complain about that, but I made some really nice putts. So it was just all pretty solid.   
 Q.  Pretty easy for you today. At least that's the way it appeared. Winning the RSM, beating Webb Simpson in the playoff, how much confidence has that given you now as you embark on this second half of the season?  
TYLER DUNCAN: It's a ton. I tell everyone that asks, it's like something switched, it's just a different mindset now. You've been there, you've done it, and it just gives you that little bit of confidence, little bit of edge that you can just keep going and do it.   
 Q.  I guess you like desert golf.  
TYLER DUNCAN: Yeah, it's fun.
