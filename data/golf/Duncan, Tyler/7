 Q.  Tyler, great round today.  Let's talk more about your backside, coming home on that front-9.  Things heated up.  
 What changes on that 9 that kind of clicked for you or is it just the holes are just easier to get on that side of the golf course?   
TYLER DUNCAN: I think you definitely have more scoring opportunities on that front side.  You have some wedges, reachable par-5s and that backside played really long this morning.  So, I played it pretty well on the back-9 and got the scoring opportunities and took advantage of them.   
 Q.  Is it more wet than you imagined?  Is that what's stretching that side of the golf course or did the golf course drain fairly well?  As most of us know, yesterday, that was one great storm that came through here.  
TYLER DUNCAN: The golf course is actually in really good shape out there.  We're playing it down today which is pretty surprising being able to play it down after the rain we had yesterday.  The fairways aren't running out a lot but yeah, it played pretty long.   
 Q.  Obviously highlight around the eagle coming home there at the par 4 5th.  On 18, your 9th green, that was one great putt.  How did it eat that much of the cup and not fall down?  
TYLER DUNCAN: I don't know.  Your guess is as good as mine.   
 Q.  All right.  Tyler, thanks so much for your time.
