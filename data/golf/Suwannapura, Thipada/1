Q. Hole-in-one, baby!  How did that feel?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Well, it's like a 161 yard to the pin and, then I decide to hit around 145 shot.  I like the way I hit in that line.  I'm like looking at the ball rolling to the thing and I'm like thinking for myself, for once hit that flag and see what's going on.
And you know the people who are walking with me today, they were like, Go, keep going, keep rolling, keep going.  Just looking at it and ball disappear.  I'm like, Ahhh, okay, that's first time hole-in-one in like tournament, even professional tournament.  Yeah.  That was cool.
Q. That's awesome.  How were the Thai fans/crowds today?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Well that whole was pretty loud.  Yeah, I saw my parents here and my friend, even like brother.  You know, like all my friend is here.  It's cool.  I mean, it's really hot today and still walking 18.  I'm like, Ahh, just going out there and have fun and just do my best.
Yeah, it's pretty fun day.  Yelling, Get in the hole or like -- you know, you can hear it.  It's pretty fun.
