 Q.  Reaction to the win?  
NIGEL EDWARDS: "Delighted with the victory, we had a very strong front and we have strength throughout the team.     
I said last night to the team that as long as the lads keep doing what they have been doing all week playing their own games, their short games are fantastic which is probably what has given us the edge, some of the bunker shots have been exceptional but also the standard of play here has been fantastic. "
