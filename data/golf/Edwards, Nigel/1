Q. 4 points in the lead going into this afternoon, can you give me your thoughts?
NIGEL EDWARDS: It was a good morning because at one point it could have been 3 -1 the other way.   Ashley and Jimmy really turned the screw on them and coming down those closing holes they did really well. The Americans holed on 14, Ashley just shaved the hole left then they won 15 and 16 to close it out which was great. Gary and Paul just do what they do they just hang in there and got the win in the end.
Q. Great partnership between Cormac and Jack?
NIGEL EDWARDS: Yes Cormac and Jack brilliant coming down there.   They have done really well they got up early on and then they were pinned back all the way and Cormac holed a great putt on 14 to stay all square so just delighted with what the boys are doing they are doing a great job.   
Q. Thoughts on this afternoon?
NIGEL EDWARDS: This is what they do at the European team championships when they play for their perspective countries and in the Home Internationals   and they have been playing lovely all week so why shouldn?t it continue.
Q. Great atmosphere out there and good conditions
NIGEL EDWARDS: Yes fantastic, the sun is out and the wind is ok, it did drop a bit on the back nine but I think there is a bit more of a breeze now.   We just need to keep ourselves honest and get it on this afternoon.
