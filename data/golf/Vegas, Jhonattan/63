 Q.   Obviously this is a bubble week.   You're right there.   How much does that enter into your mind?   Obviously you're on the inside of the 125.   How much is the Top 125 on your mind?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   It is on your mind the whole time.   Every shot you hit, you know that you're 124 and you have to make it the next week but, at the same time, I mean I decided to make it fun.   
I have to go there and play good and make things happen and, you know, as long as, you know, you have to make things happen, I think, you know, it gets a little bit easier and more fun.  
   
 Q.   Is there any kind of playing with the lead type of thing that you would rather be the guy on the outside working your way in or holding on to what you got on the inside?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   At this point it doesn't really matter.   I mean you just got to play, play a good round and, you know, so forth and hoping for four good rounds to go and have a good tournament.   
Because, I mean, things move so quick in here that you just worrying about I'm 124, 125, you know, you can really lose what you're doing here.   
Like I say, I'm going to go have fun and hopefully will work out.
