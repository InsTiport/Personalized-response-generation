 Q.  Tell me how difficult the 17th hole is playing today.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Oh, my God, it's probably the hardest hole on the course today.  You have to hit an unbelievable shot to get it on the section of the flag.  Made it a little more interesting when I won it.  But it's always cool to win out here.   
 Q.  Tough match yesterday.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It was really hard.  I felt like there were a bunch of times where I had the momentum going on my side, and I just couldn't put enough pressure on him.  He's such a good player that he's not going to give you anything.  Obviously a learning process, first time here.  But obviously having a blast.  People in Austin have been great.  Just loving it.   
 Q.  Tomorrow you are still in it now with this win.  What's the game plan for you the rest of the afternoon?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Do a little practicing, trying get things better for tomorrow.  I feel like the game is turning the right way.  Just try to play good tomorrow.  Scott Piercy is obviously a tough player.  Try to get a win and see what Bubba does and see how it goes from there.
