JHONATTAN VEGAS: The only chance that you have is to birdie and give yourself the best chance you can.  That's the only thing that you can do.   
Luckily I have been in this situation enough in match play that I know that I have to stay patient, but at the same time stay really, really aggressive.  I feel like I did that.  Hit a good tee shot.  Pretty good wedge into that hole.  Obviously a good putt.   
 Q.  Talk about that putt again and how much that meant.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: I mean, it was a really important putt.  Especially after being down pretty much today, being able to get a point.  It's important around here, especially being a tough group.  Every point here just counts.  You have got to give yourself the best chance.  I had a bunch of opportunities.  It was a little bit of a strain because I couldn't make one, but luckily I made a good one on 18 to have a half a point.   
 Q.  Great reaction there from fans.  You have got a lot of them here.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's cool.  I would say that the fans definitely kind of pulled me through at the end there.  Just playing here, a place that I'm really familiar with where I have a lot of friends, just getting the support is obviously important.  Hopefully we can keep it going.   
 Q.  Comment lastly about Brian.  He's a tough cookie, isn't he?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: He's a tough guy.  Neither of us played great golf today, to be honest.  At the end of the day, match play is about just beating each other.  So we were going hard at it.  None of us could have really made a putt to beat each other.  The way we played, I think we're both okay with a half.
