 Q.  What's it like for you to come back to a place where you had your first ever PGA TOUR win?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Obviously, there's a lot of good memories here.  Second tournament as a TOUR player, having a win here in Palm Springs.  And every time I get here, I see the mountains, a lot of good memories come to my mind.  So, it is a good place.  I feel comfortable.  I have a lot of friends that live here.  I know the courses fairly well, so I really feel comfortable.   
 Q.  It seems like you've matured a lot and we just talked about the fact that you have a little girl, 10 months old.  Has that changed how you approach life and golf?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Oh, definitely.  I think every time you have a kid, life takes a different route.  And you normally think about yourself, now it's about family, how do you behave, how do you do things.  You have to work differently, you have a family to take care of.  So, it's been fun.  We're loving it.  My wife and I are loving it, and it's been a joy in my life.
