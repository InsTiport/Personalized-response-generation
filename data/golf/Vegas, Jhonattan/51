Q. All right, only one bogey at card.  I know it's a tough way to finish, but how solid would you say that round was?  Not a lot of low numbers out there today.
JHONATTAN VEGAS: No, I know.  I actually felt like from tee-to-green I played way better than yesterday, to be honest.  I just couldn't buy any putts.
Hit a bunch of good putts and obviously finishing with a bogey is never good thing, but I'm in a great position for the weekend.  I'm looking forward for a good weekend.  A lot of good things happening in my game right now, so super exciting.
Q. You are in a great position.  You played the early late wave in this tournament.  How different did the golf course play this afternoon, if at all?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Well, I would say it played at least three, four shots harder this afternoon especially with the pin positions we played this afternoon or today.  It was tougher.  I knew it, so I didn't really get too hard on myself because I wasn't making that many birdies.
But I played a solid round and feeling great, which is the best thing right now.
Q. You're working with a new caddie.  How is that going?  Feeling more comfortable?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's been probably huge part of the success this week.  Making better decisions on the golf course.  Really hitting the right clubs consistently.  I think it's like I said a huge part of why I'm playing that way.
