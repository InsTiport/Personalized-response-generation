 Q.  Not the team result you wanted but you played absolutely great today.  Was it a validation of how hard you've played the last four days?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It feels good getting a point for the International Team.  I gave my heart out this week.  You know, I feel like I'm a good match play player, so really, that was my thing this week.  I just give it all-out, give it my best, and you never know when things can turn around for our team.   
Obviously it wasn't the result we needed but it was a fun competition.  I really, really, really enjoyed being here and being part of this team.   
 Q.  You win that match, your father comes out, drapes the flag around you.  What has this week meant to you and your family and your country?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Well, it's big.  Any time you can lift your flag on a stage like this, it's always motivating.  It's always, you know, exciting for every player, especially in this type of competition where there are pretty much five continents and you're representing Venezuela which is having a hard time right now.   
Hopefully this gives a little bit of a lift to the people there and can find motivation from what I'm doing to keep working and fighting for their lives.
