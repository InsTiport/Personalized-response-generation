   JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's been a good year for first timers, and hopefully we can keep it going here.

 Q. What are your impressions of the course out there? 
 JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's a great, great, great course. I mean, it's one of those courses that you can really, really play good at. But at the same time it really can bite you. 
 So yeah, love it. Hopefully it's going to be a good week for me.

 Q. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, getting ready, are you one of the guys that just can't wait for Thursday to get here? 
 JHONATTAN VEGAS: Yeah, I love competing. I really, really love competing. It's something that I'm going to enjoy doing. I can't wait to come here, play and get back into the top position here.
