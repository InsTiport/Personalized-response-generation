 Q. I'm going to ask you about graduating from the Nationwide Tour, and so far your progress this year on TOUR. 
 JHONATTAN VEGAS: Okay, yeah. 

 Q. I would think that this is -- I know you went to South America during your off-season, and that was kind of the leading catapult for -- that's what your credit for your good play so far this year, but in just a mere two, three months how far you've come from getting your card. Can you kind of look back and --
 JHONATTAN VEGAS: Yeah, no, definitely. I mean, it's been a good journey. It's been really good. It's really exciting because of, like I said, I knew that I guess I had a pretty good end of last season on the Nationwide, and it was good to finish 7th, and then went home, went to Argentina to play a couple tournaments to get ready for the beginning of the year because I knew that playing good early on would have made the year a lot easier, so I did that. I had a great off-season, won a golf tournament or two I would say, and then just came here and played great golf. I've been playing super, super good, and just enjoying myself here.

 Q. Looking back, if you hadn't had the success on the Nationwide Tour, you probably wouldn't be this confident. Would you credit the Nationwide Tour for your confidence?
 JHONATTAN VEGAS: You know what, I think the Nationwide has made me the professional I am right now because I've learned so many things there, so many ways to play, so many ways to make birdies, staying patient. There's so many things that you learn by being out there; good and bad moments, you know how to deal with all those moments. By being there for two years, I think it prepared me for the PGA TOUR.
