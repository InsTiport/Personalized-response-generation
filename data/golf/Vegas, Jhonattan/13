Q. 36 holes in the books; what's working for you in defending your championship?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Well, I mean, just playing okay.  To be honest, I haven't really felt like I've been doing a lot of good stuff other than making a few putts, which always helps around here, and of course you have to make a lot of birdies.  My body is still not feeling great probably from all the traveling I did last week.  My back especially at the end got really tight and kept hitting a bunch of shots long and to the left and made some bad bogeys, which didn't help, especially with the leaders still having to play this afternoon.  So I'm going to be way back, probably farther back from previous years, but I know that I can go low here, so hopefully can play a put a couple rounds together.
Q. Must be nice to have your own clubs.
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It helps having everything together for a week.  But even though I feel comfortable, the course is not playing as easy as especially last year.  The wind is really playing a big factor.  Given that, hopefully -- I feel a little bit better.  You need to hit good shots, especially to the par-5s, and take advantage of those holes.
