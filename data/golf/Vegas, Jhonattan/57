Q.   Came into the week 124 and you did what you had to do.   You have to be happy even though you had ended on a bad note there with the bogey at the last.
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   Yeah.   I mean the goal was definitely to move on to next week which, mission accomplished.   You know, I feel front-9 today I gave myself a good chance to win the golf tournament and kind of played poorly.   But I'm just pleased to move on.   FedExCup starts and anything can happen.   I'm glad to be playing great and hopefully we can keep playing.

Q.   Was there an added incentive this week for pressure to come here and play well and make sure you stay in the 125?
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   Definitely.   There's always more pressure when you're 124 and you have the last tournament to play so, you know, I feel good that I performed that kind of pressure and it was a fun week, just kind of getting back in contention, having a chance to win, it's always fun and fortunately it will happen soon.

Q.   What are you looking forward to in the coming weeks?
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   Definitely playing great in The Playoffs.   If you play good there you can really move up so it's good to go with a good momentum into The Playoffs and, like I said, anything can happen and who knows, maybe I can win it.

Q.   What's going well in your game right now?
JHONATTAN VEGAS:   Just feeling, start to feel physically healthy again and which leads into being, you know, stronger mentally.   That's definitely a good combination and you combine a good mental game with good physical game, good things happen.
