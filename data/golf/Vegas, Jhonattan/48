Q. Other than the par-4 6th, it went quite well.  What went well for you out there today?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: You know what, I feel like it was a lot of good things, and I mean, I just let everything happen.  That's my mentality for the week, and I was able to do that really well today.  I hit the ball well, made some great putts, and you know, put a good round together.
Q. You got two top 10s, four top 20s, playing out of the past champion category.  You've really taken advantage of that this year.  What's been the key for you?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Just to really take it one shot at a time, to be honest.  I really don't know exactly what's going to happen next week, so I've got to really focus on this week, which actually has been really good.  It kind of puts a little extra pressure on you, which for me that's good, makes me focus a little bit more and makes me play even harder.
