Q. I feel for you, I don't know if I've ever seen anybody have so many putts hang on the edge.  That was agonizing, wasn't it?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It was, especially just kind of the whole day felt that way, believe it or not.  But at the end of the day it was a solid round.  I have to stay focused on the things that are going well.  Sometimes it's really easy to get caught up into what could have happened and this and this and that.  I'm in a good position heading into the weekend, I feel like I'm playing good golf, I feel like I'm putting really well and all I have to do is try to be good at what I can control and then let the rest happen.
Q. You already previewed part two of the interview here because the good news is you're putting yourself in those spots and you're hitting the lines right.
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Yes, exactly.  That's kind of what I feel like I'm doing well.  Can't really complain about the results, which is something hard that we tend to kind of deal with here on TOUR.  But I feel like I'm putting well, I feel like I'm making some really good putts and I'm eliminating a lot of mistakes, which around this golf course is key.
Q. The 11th hole, it looked like your heels were pretty close to the water there, were you concerned at all, because you hit an incredible shot.
JHONATTAN VEGAS: You know what, luckily it wasn't that close, but I was, my feet were in the rough, but I mean I knew I had a perfect yardage, perfect lie, wind out of the right, it couldn't have been a more perfect scenario for that shot and luckily I hit a good one.
