Q. Obviously not the ideal day, but you're in great position when you do get back out on the course.  What do you do to kind of go through the process of keeping yourself relaxed in situations like this?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: You just got to find something to do.  That would be the best thing.  You cannot let your mind wander around and start thinking about how close to the lead you are or one of the leaders.  You just got to find something to do to relax, because a lot can go through your mind and that's the worst thing.
Q. A lot of start, stop, start, stop -- you're obviously in great position one shot off the lead.  Have you been able to really assess what you've been doing to get you to that point of 11-under?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Not really.  I'm just focusing on playing golf and that's kind of what I feel it's working for me right now, just not thinking much, just playing.  And, obviously, it's just stopping and waiting so long, I played 30 holes yesterday, that was pretty tiring.  But I'm just trying to keep it simple and keep playing simple golf.
