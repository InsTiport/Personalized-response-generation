Q. (No Microphone.)
JHONATTAN VEGAS: I had those 10 to 15, 16, I lost a little bit of my mojo there, just lost focus, which is really easy to do here.  There's a lot of waiting, there's a lot of walking up-and-down and you get tired, distracted.  But at least I was able to finish with a birdie on 18, at 8-under, at least a couple shots behind going into the weekend.  This is a big course, I feel like I'm playing well, so I just got to stay put with what I'm doing and see what happens at the end.
Q. When you make that turn over 10 and the wind picks up, is it a little bit difficult, do you feel a little bit protected here?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Well you have to really be careful with those holes, especially 10, 11, 13, those are holes that can really easily get you.  So obviously they got me today, which is kind of what I avoided yesterday.  But still 3-under is not a bad round to post today, but after a great start, 4-under the first nine, it could have been a great round.
Q. You're playing well, swinging it well and doing that, but what's your mentality going into the weekend?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's a loaded leaderboard for sure so you're going to have to stay aggressive here.  There's a lot of birdies on this course, so just got to stay aggressive and keep doing what I've been doing.
