 Q.  The way the second round ended, at least how the score went, even if it wasn't the ideal way to finish a couple of holes there.  How difficult is it to come out and just play a couple of holes?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It's hard.  It's hard because it's almost like it's an abbreviated warmup and abbreviated mentality to come out to the round.   
It's golf.  It's something that we have to be prepared for and I was.  Unfortunately, didn't make those 10-footers, which would have been great.  Still a pretty solid second round.  Hopefully we can get two more rounds in as soon as possible.   
 Q.  If you had your druthers, would you rather come back and hit a fairway shot or tee shot rather than the 10-foot putt you had to come back and have on your mind all night last night?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: For sure.  More than having it in the mind, it's more about rhythm, hitting a shot, hitting a putt. You want to get into a rhythm.  Have having a 10-foot putt, it's hard to get in a rhythm.   
Like I said, it is what it is.  That's something you have to deal with.  I was prepared, but unfortunately I just didn't make it.   
 Q.  They are still not sure, 36 tomorrow, possibly play on Monday.  Whatever happens, I guess you have to roll with it either way.  Are you prepared to kind of hang out the rest of today?  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: I am.  I am.  It's been a long year for me, to be honest, so having a day off where I just can sit around, watch some football, do something else is good, especially when we have to play 36 holes.  So I think we are sitting on the best part of the draw looking forward.  I'm looking and feeling great.
