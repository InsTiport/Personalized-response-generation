Q. Topsy-turvy day, some tough conditions, wasn't it?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It was really hard.  I wasn't expecting anything less around this playing, especially with how firm the greens are and how the wind is this afternoon.  But I didn't feel like I played great.  I really wish I would have had just one or two shots back, but it's the way the course is playing.  You've got to take what it gives you and try your best.
Q. Compared to your round on Thursday when you were bogey-free 6-under 64, how different is it right now?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: I mean, it's all different.  I was really talking with my caddie about that.  Obviously the first morning the greens were softer, you could take a lot more aggressive lines.  Fairways were softer, easier to hit, and you could be a little more -- you had a little more freedom on Thursday morning.  Here you had to think about where to bounce it, where to leave it, all that stuff, and obviously the wind plays a huge factor.  Whole different golf course from Thursday morning, but I love the challenge.  That's kind of why I feel like I play well on this course.
Q. When you see the scoreboard and 56-year-old Vijay Singh is right there near the top, what do you think?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Well, that's exactly what I told my caddie on 13 as we were going past that leaderboard there on 13.  I seen that he shot 65.  That was impressive.  It obviously shows how good of a player he still is, and to play under these conditions shows the toughness of Vijay.
