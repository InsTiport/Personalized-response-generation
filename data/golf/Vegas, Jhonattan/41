Q. Up-and-down round for you; very positive and some struggles?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Yeah, it was a tough day finishing this round.  It could have been a great round.  But you know, I'm pleased where I am right now.  Obviously would like to be a few shots better, but still in a good place for a great weekend.
Q. Two rounds at this golf course, so what do you think about this golf course?  Do you like it?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: I love it to be honest.  It's a super challenging golf course.  No matter where you are, you get really hard shots around here.  It tests you mentally, which is the biggest thing here.  I like it.  I love it.  It's my type of course.  I'm having a good time.
Q. Back at 13, you almost made a birdie putt from off the green; is it shots like that that you have to be patient to do well on this golf course?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: That's exactly what this course puts you through.  It tests your patience and you cannot be too aggressive or feel too comfortable on this place.  Every shot, every hole is really demanding and you have to be within your element to handle the best way you can.
