 Q.  Jhonattan, I'm going to use the double bogey as more of a positive because you bounced right back with a birdie and an eagle.  Sometimes you go the other direction.  
 Looks like your head is in a good spot this week.   
JHONATTAN VEGAS: It is.  It's been a good spot for awhile.  I mean this is a course especially with the wind playing today that you're going to make mistakes.  Obviously you want to limit the mistakes, obviously that hole I didn't do that that well but I knew I was playing well, that I've been hitting good shots all day and playing well so, you know, I mean it's fine.  Lucky to bounce back obviously and post a good round.   
 Q.  It's been about two years since I've seen not a smile on your face.  You're happy and healthy and you go play golf.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Makes a big difference being healthy.  I think we all know how it is to not be.  Obviously been healthy, been in a good place and family, everyone that's been around so I mean this is a good place right now.   
 Q.  Keep it going man, you're in a good place here and the wind is up and your golf game is good.  Keep it going.  
JHONATTAN VEGAS: Thank you buddy, I appreciate it.
