 Q.  Can you talk us through it this how did it go out there?  JANE RAH: I just hit it really well.  I gave myself lots of chances and I just played smart out there.  Just went for a lot of the middle of the greens, so I didn't put myself in trouble.   Q.  The conditions, seems like it's starting to blow a little bit.  How was it early in the morning?  JANE RAH: Pretty calm and just walking up 18 I think was the biggest breeze we felt.  So I'm glad I'm done.   Q.  How do you feel placed at 3-under?  JANE RAH: I think it's good.  I feel good about my round.  I did all I could out there.   Q.  Overall, how has this experience been overall in Westchester?  JANE RAH: This is amazing.   This is such a great facility, such great history, and it's nice to be in a big city like New York City.  There's just so much to do, so it's fun.   Q.  Have you been able to spend some time in the city?  JANE RAH: Yeah, definitely.  Went to a Yankees game and I've also gone to a Mets game.  I was there at the no-hitter, when the Giants had the no-hitter, so that was a lot of fun.   Q.  How was that?  JANE RAH: Probably until the seventh inning, I didn't even realize it was a no-hitter.  So it was really exciting the last two inning, just knowing that every pitch counted.   Q.  Are you going to stay in New York for a little bit afterwards?  JANE RAH: No, ready to go back home to California.  I've been out on the road for a few months.  I just did all my New York stuff at the beginning of the week.   Q.  Coming into this tournament, anything you've been working on lately?  JANE RAH: I think the last two weeks, we had a three-week stretch, and I didn't score as well but I gave myself a lot of chances.  I think today I just eliminated a lot of the bogeys, which just helped with my score.
