 Q.  What was the difference today?  
SOPHIE HAUSMANN: Didn't make the up-and-downs that I made yesterday, and then I missed some in the wrong spots.  Just here and there, the pins were on a totally different sides of the green, makes the whole a lot different.  Made some very bad swings, kind of added up together.   
 Q.  Regardless of obviously what happens today, is it still reassuring knowing you get the opportunity to play at Augusta National tomorrow?  
SOPHIE HAUSMANN: I mean, obviously I'm excited for it, but right now, kind of a little bummed.  It will take a couple minutes.  I mean, I will enjoy it tomorrow.  It's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I'm looking forward to, but just from the competition mode right now, pretty upset.   
 Q.  From that competition mode, what are you going to be able to take home tonight that you can internalize and say, hey, these things need to be adjusted?  What do you take away from today?  
SOPHIE HAUSMANN: Overall, I would definitely say, okay, yesterday I played a good round and put myself in a good position, and know that, okay, I can compete here.   
But on the other hand, you have it's not just one round.  A couple swing adjustments and mental stuff, course management, but overall, really positive thing to say, okay, you are right here, and next time, do better.   
 Q.  This field is so diverse and there are so many women from different countries from all over the world.  What does it mean to represent your home country here?  
SOPHIE HAUSMANN: It's great, and being in the top 72 players in the world, it's a big deal.  So probably it will take a couple seconds and somebody will say, hey, you're still in the top 72, which is pretty good.  But like if you're only from two Germans and you're one of them, it's pretty cool.
