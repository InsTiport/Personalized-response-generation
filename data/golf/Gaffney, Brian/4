Q.   Talk about these 36 holes and your thoughts on the week. 
BRIAN GAFFNEY:   I guess, you know, what I take from it is I learned that I'm a long way off from where I think I am. 
But it's just, you know, there's so many mistakes that I make that other guys don't.   Most of it is short‑game related; chipping, pitching around the greens, a little bit of putting, but I think I put too much pressure on my putting because I chipped so poorly.   I guess the positive is that I can get here, and the positive is that there is a chance, because when I do well, when I hit decent shots, I'm not taking great shots; just decent shots, I can keep up. 
And so I guess this is just a matter of like I really need to commit to this and I'm going to do this, and I really need to commit to it and change my practice, the amount I practice, maybe the instruction I get for practice, and of course my body, I need to become stronger and be able to hit it maybe a little farther and just be able to practice longer without injuring myself.

Q.   What are your thoughts on the golf course?
BRIAN GAFFNEY:   You know, I shot 85.   I actually thought today it was set up very fair.   Holes that were into the wind, I think they did a nice job moving the tees up and the hole locations were not crazy difficult.   You know, and I got to much with a guys‑‑ Marc Leishman shot 72 and it was interesting just watching him work his way around the golf course, because he made mistakes, but he also obviously made the birdies.   I thought it was set up great.
