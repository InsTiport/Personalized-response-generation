  Q. So how do you sort of summarize your round, your week, your experience here?  
 BRIAN GAFFNEY: Of course disappointing. But it's a great opportunity and I am going to try to come back and be more prepared than I was this time.  
  
  Q. What do you take away?  
 BRIAN GAFFNEY: It's hard, because it's so completely different from what we normally play. So it's hard to practice something you're never around. But I guess I could be in better physical shape, maybe have a little bit better mental shape. I don't know if my expectations are out of line with my ability. But clearly I didn't play what I think I can play to.   
 So that is disappointing. But in a couple of weeks I'll forget about all this.  
  
  Q. You can always look back and say: Yeah, I was in that tournament. Remember when?  
 BRIAN GAFFNEY: I'll be able to say I played with Michael Sim before he won his first TOUR event or his first major, because that guy is just a star in the waiting. He's a star on the rise. And it was a pleasure watching that guy play golf.   
 And then the other guy I played with, Michael Bradley, couldn't have made it more comfortable for me. So the golf is disappointing. The whole experience was just awesome.
