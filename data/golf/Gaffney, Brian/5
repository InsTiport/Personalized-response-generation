 Q.   Talk about your round today.   What did you see out there?   How difficult was it?   
BRIAN GAFFNEY:   That's a good question.   It wasn't as difficult as any of the other events I've played.   But I guess I'm just not there yet.   I think I am, but I just managed to mess things up, and I just make such bad mistakes.   So yeah.   
   
 Q.   What are you looking to improve tomorrow, just working on little kinks?   
BRIAN GAFFNEY:   I don't really know what to say.   (Indiscernible.)  
Part of it is just not letting it go and letting it happen and trusting it.   (Indiscernible.)
