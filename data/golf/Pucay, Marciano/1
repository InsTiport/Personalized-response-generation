 Q. You should be pretty happy with your play today. 
 ANGELO QUE: Yeah, not bad. Could have been better, but who's complaining. Didn't start as well as the others, but got some birdies coming in the last few holes, so quite happy. 

 Q. How many birdies did you make? 
 ANGELO QUE: We made five birdies with one bogey. 

 Q. Who got the birdies? 
 ANGELO QUE: I birdied 3 -- I think I birdied 4. He birdied one. So it was pretty good. 

 Q. I know this is just the first day, so the plan for tomorrow, the foursomes? 
 ANGELO QUE: If we can shoot 4-under again, that would be pretty good. 

 Q. Any thoughts on the round today?
 MARCIANO PUCAY: I wasn't playing well today. Thank my partner for making a lot of birdies today. I only contributed one, and actually, I didn't hit the ball really well today. So hopefully I can hit better tomorrow and the rest of the week.
