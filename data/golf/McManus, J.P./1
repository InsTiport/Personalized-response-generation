 Q.   J.P. McManus, PÃ¡draig Harrington, what has this week been like, especially coming down 18 and you had a chance to get that co championship?   
J.P. McMANUS:   I knew I needed birdie because I screwed up big time.   I was in good shape for my drive.   And, listen, I never doubted PÃ¡draig, that he would get it up‑and‑down.  
   
 Q.   You did hit a fantastic shot out of the bunker but PÃ¡draig made the 5 that clinched the co‑championship.   Tell us about the species of playing with Mr.McManus all week?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     We have been playing together, this is probably close to 20 of these at this stage, we have played Dunhills in Europe and the AT&T now for a seventh year, and this is the best I've seen him play.   
He really hit the golf ball great and hit some putts, he put it at times that pros would liked to have put it.   He holed some great pressure putts and the last two days we were leading and it's always tough when you are leading, you're a little bit more cautious and you're a little bit safer.   
Even though we had a big lead, you knew it was going to come right down to a stretch, his birdie on 16 was exactly what we needed at the time.   We got one on 17 and obviously 18 was a little bit of a struggle after a while, but it worked out.   
   
 Q.   The excitement of coming back to this setting to play each year just continued to build for you and your amateur partners?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I've got to say, it's improving this event over the years.   There's a great atmosphere now around us.   It's fantastic for the TOUR players that we get to mix with the big stars.   We come out, and guess who I just had breakfast with.   It is a buzz for us to be here.   And it's nice, every week we play 72 hole stroke‑play events, so it's nice to do something different.   
Again, I have a set amateur partner that comes with me every time, so I'm going to enjoy the week regardless of how I play or regardless how we do as a team.   It's been a bonus, we have won the Dunhill twice, so nice to put this one on, as well.
