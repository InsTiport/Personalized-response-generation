 Q.  (Inaudible) Does it affect you and make your hair stand up?  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, it does a little bit.  You've definitely got to take it all in.  So nice slow walk, sure, it does that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, I played nicely.  I had a bit of a target of 68 today.  Under par in your first Open is nice.   
 Q.  It looked very enjoyable.  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, I've had a week of enjoyable days.  One more tomorrow will be great.   
 Q.  Has some of your fan club gone home?  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, some have gone home -- yeah, there's a still few out there.  A few making their travels today.  But it's quite an expensive week, so a few days is great.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, I found out yesterday.  Someone was singing yesterday in the pavilion out the back.  So the house was a bit crazy last night.   
 Q.  What were they singing?  
ALFIE PLANT: What were they singing?  I can't even remember.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yes, it's nice, of course it is.  I played with all the other guys on a pretty regular basis.  It would have been nice for a few of them to make it through today.  But I enjoyed myself out there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  Follow in the footsteps of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy?  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, it's great, isn't it?  I'd like to carry on and follow in their footsteps.  It would be great.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: I might, I'm not sure yet.  See how much it's worth on eBay first, I think.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: I've been pretty relaxed all week.  It's a lot easier out there with the sun shining, so, really good day.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, of course you do.  It's nice to be out here and competing with these guys, and I've played with some very good players the last few days.  My score is great.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: You'll have to ask my dad that.  It was forced on me, to be honest.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to play The Open?  
ALFIE PLANT: It means the world.  It's the major in the UK.  So it's such a great tournament.  And I think I'd have taken any of the majors, but this is great for family and friends to be able to come up and watch.   
 Q.  Did you have to pinch yourself?  
ALFIE PLANT: There's been a couple of times I've sat down on a bank and just made sure I'd taken it all in.  You definitely get them times out there.  I'm glad I am taking it all in.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Not really, no.  I don't think I will until I'm sitting out there in that chair ready to go up.  I've got to focus on tomorrow and I'm sure I'll enjoy tomorrow.   
 Q.  Have you hear from any former colleagues from the office here this week?  
ALFIE PLANT: Not this week but my phone has been going a bit crazy.  I don't think there's been much work going on in the office.  But I know they enjoyed it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, that is correct.  Yeah, Daisy Meadows.  Will draw a few chuckles at the church if things go as planned.   
 Q.  Nice gardening theme to it.  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, there is.  All the girls out there, I end up with a Daisy.  What's the chances?   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: No, I haven't.  Trying to compete, are they?   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: Yeah, I've got my mid-week's table for next week, which I'm eager to get back to.  Only joking.  Got English Am, and U.S. Am, hopefully the Walker Cup and then straight to Tour School.  Busy couple of months.   
 Q.  Are you finally getting excited?  
ALFIE PLANT: Not really, no (laughter).   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ALFIE PLANT: I'm so busy all year, I don't get time to go out there too much.  I'll practise and catch up with a few friends.
