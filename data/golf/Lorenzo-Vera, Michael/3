   MICHAEL GIBBONS: Superb round today, 12-under leading the tournament, how does it feel at this stage.  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: It's very good, because I had two months of resting and I was just coming here to find some new feelings.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: You found a good feeling.   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I found good ones.  
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: What was wrong with the wrist?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: It was my usual stupid self - I fell backwards down the stairs at home and I have just come back and have it working. It was not very clever.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: And this is your first tournament back.  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, so Julian Paragade, the French physio, made a miracle.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: Tell us about the round today.   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Today was, good -- yesterday the putting was really good. I had to wait a little on the front nine today. I was putting very well on the front nine, from far away, too, but nothing was dropping for me and then on the back nine I managed to get it a little bit nearer the flag and started to hole them, so everything was good.   
  
  Q. When did you fall and hurt your wrist?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: When? Two months ago.   
  
  Q. And did you say that the putts, after the turn, the three in a row were quite long?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: On the front nine, the putts were not really good enough, I don't know why. I had a few long putts.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: On the back nine, you hit your irons closer?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, closer, not really good putts.   
  
  Q. Which wrist did you damage?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Right one.   
  
  Q. Are you a rugby fan?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, big fan.   
  
  Q. Did you play rugby when you were a youngster?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, when I was six, but I realised quickly that I am not built for that game and quickly went to the golf. (Laughter).  
  
  Q. Did you want to be a rugby player?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: That could be cool, yeah, to enter on the field with all of this crowd applauding. That's a really great sport.   
  
  Q. You're not doing too badly at golf, are you?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I'm pretty happy. It's much more fun I think. Less injuries for sure.   
  
  Q. You have a two-shot lead now going into the third round, or it looks like you'll have a two-shot lead. How do you feel about your prospects?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I hope this time I'm going to catch it. I had a few occasions last year, and I let it go, so just going to try to make a good weekend. I hit a lot of greens in regulation like I did today, so waiting for the chances to go in. We'll see.  
  
  Q. How has this past season been for you, 2008?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I had three good months. I had a second place in China and a few good places on the big ones, enough to keep my card but then I had a bit of a blackout. Two days work, then two days holidays - I had too many weekends off.   
  
  Q. Some players would like the wind to blow on the third and fourth day. Do you want the wind to blow?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Could be cool to have it stay like this. My putting is good and I can shoot pretty low. So I don't want to struggle making pars all day long. I'm not sure that I'm going to have the patience for it. I certainly don't have the physique for it but I'm working on it.  
  
  Q. Do you regard yourself as a good wind player?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Not really, not really. If the greens are soft, yes. But on hard greens, it's going to be really maybe a nightmare for me.   
  
  Q. Did you play this course last year?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Missed the cut or make it?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: No, I was pretty well after two rounds again. I think I was eighth or ninth, I don't remember. But after I got destroyed totally by the wind. The wind came too strong for me.   
  
  Q. Now we understand.   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Now you can understand.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: Michael, good luck for the weekend
