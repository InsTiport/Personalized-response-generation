  Q. Good day?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, hard.   
  
  Q. You had a bit of a roller coaster.   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I felt.....not really pressure, but I'm struggling on my fade and I tried a few stupid things.   
 Double on the third, I was really just unlucky I think. I had a good lie and the ball just didn't fly through the bush. I tried a shot, something pretty stupid. That was a shot I would never -- I just tried, just in case.....   
  
  Q. And you recovered brilliantly with the eagle two holes later.   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, the eagle was downwind so it was a par 4 really, and I hit two good shots and good putt.   
 Then after, the pin positions were pretty hard to keep the ball near. That's when I tried this fade on the 12, a good slice.   
  
  Q. So you have to stop hitting the fade tomorrow?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Maybe I'm going to do that even better today I hope.   
  
  Q. Thoughts for tomorrow, confidence is high?   
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, I just have to work hard tonight on my fade for sure. If I can fade the ball, I think I can do really well.   
  
  Q. Do you think you can win here?  
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I think so. But I don't think the irons are good enough to win at the moment, so have to make them better.
