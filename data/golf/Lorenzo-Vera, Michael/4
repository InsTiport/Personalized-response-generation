 Q. Do tell us how good that was today. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: This was really good. Driving is getting better. Errant shots are better. Sand wedge is all right and putter is definitely good. 

 Q. You said on the first day that the driving wasn't particularly good, but you got yourself out of trouble very big time with the putting. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, definitely, I'm just having a good roll and a good touch. 

 Q. I take it you're getting used to Adare Manor, as well, and the nuances of the course? The differences of the course, you're getting to know it? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, for the first time of my life I'm maybe getting intelligence! Like I said just taking the good side and playing the shots. Just you see it, you go, and you don't look after what you did. 

 Q. I think you're running yourself down; you do learn these courses very quickly on the first time out on the Tour. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, my friends told me, the guys who played last year just told me where to go sometimes, and just listen to them and they helped me to play well.

 Q. Who are those friends who have given you advice?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: All of the French guys and definitely my caddie, Richard, who caddied last year. He knows the course perfectly and where to go, so I just trust him 100%, and here we go. 

 Q. Do you like it?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, I prefer to know the course before coming, but that's the game. Next year. 

 Q. Do you like the kind of history of the place, as well? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I take the pictures from everywhere on my practice day, so it's really fantastic and good feelings everywhere. 

 Q. Presumably, you've got good feelings into the weekend, bearing in mind just the run of form you've had in China. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I can't tell you anything for the moment. You know, so many people play well for the first two rounds and fall away after that, so I will try to keep the same game, and I will tell you that on Sunday. 

 Q. When you first practised, what did you think? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: God! I I was thinking around four, five over would be the cut -- don't do worse than five. 

 Q. What was the scariest part of the course?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Driving. There is a lot of points that you can - you have no vantage point to aim at. Like No. 8, is for me, is very hard to drive, because I don't have anything to target. 

 Q. Even Lee Westwood was saying the fairways were cut like that as well. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Sometimes you get a bad kick and, oh, it's in the rough the rough.

 Q. Have you experienced Irish hospitality yet? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I tried, this is my fourth time in Ireland. 

 Q. Were you second on the Challenge Tour in irland?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, second, and it was in Athlone. I played as an amateur in Lahinch.

 Q. What is your favourite drink?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: It's not the Guinness. I'm a big fan of Heineken, sorry. 

 Q. Coming from Biarritz do you play rugby?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yes, I tried but I was no good.

Q. What did they say to you?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: They didn't say anything to me -- it was just, okay, off you go and try something else. 

 Q. So they would go off and play rugby and send you off to the golf course? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Yes. 

 Q. Was your mother disappointed if she was a coach and you ended up playing golf? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: No, she preferred to see me in a nice place, at the golf, easy. She's a coach for the young players. 

 Q. Mini-rugby?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: When you start, between 10 and 11 -- no, sorry, 7 and 11. My brother played 11 years, he was pretty good, but was broken, totally. 

 Q. I believe you wear some special interior clothes on Saturdays, underpants? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I changed. I finished the superstition. I'm just going to take out a fresh pair tomorrow without even looking!

 Q. What sort of under pants?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: It was a horrible quicksilver pair. They were white, horrible. If my girlfriend saw that, she would throw up. 

 Q. You don't need any superstitions anymore, is that it? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: White tees --

 Q. And how did that superstition come about? 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: I don't know, good drive, good drive -- Yeah, I gave my hat yesterday; do I have to keep it? I change new one this morning. 

 Q. How long did you have the previous hat?
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: One day. It was new. 

 Q. You played well and almost won on the Challenge Tour event last year. 
 MICHAEL LORENZO-VERA: Ireland is good for me, I'll just try to do the same or better.
