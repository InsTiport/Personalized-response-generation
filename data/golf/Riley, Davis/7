 Q.  What was going through your mind toward the end of the round?  Did you know where you stood?  
DAVIS RILEY: I really didn't.  I was just kind of playing one shot at a time, just zoning in on the shot.  I didn't really know until after the round that I had a chance to set the course record, but it was fun.   
 Q.  When things are going that well, the game seems pretty easy, doesn't it?  
DAVIS RILEY: Yeah, you get caught up in it.  You really don't even know where you really stand.  Me and my coach were zoning in and we had a great time out there.   
 Q.  You also had a chance to make birdie on 17 and 18; what happened there?  Couldn't convert.  
DAVIS RILEY: Yeah, I had two really good looks coming in.  Unfortunately they didn't go in, but I had a good time.   
 Q.  You're in control of your match today through 10 holes, currently 3-up.  On No. 2, you eagled it today, you had a terrific second shot.  Tell me about it.  
DAVIS RILEY: Yeah, I hit a really good tee shot, set up really well.  Hit a really good 5-iron in there to about 15 feet, really good look and rolled it in.  Got off to a good start.
