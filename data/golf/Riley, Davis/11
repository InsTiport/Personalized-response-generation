 Q.  Davis, strong ending to make it to match play.  Birdied three of the last four holes.  
DAVIS RILEY: Oh, yeah, I told myself coming down the stretch that I need to birdie one or two at least to get in, and really pleased with the way I executed and finished the round.   
 Q.  Tell me about a couple of those birdies.  
DAVIS RILEY: Yeah, I started out on 6.  I birdied -- made like a 15-footer down the hill, and then I get to the par-5, hit an approach to about eight feet, drain it.  No. 8, hit one to about 10 feet, and it was straight up the hill and knocked it in the back, and parred 18.   
 Q.  And then let's talk about making match play for the first time at the Amateur.  This is your third Amateur.  What's that feel like?  
DAVIS RILEY: It feels good.  I really like the match play format, so I feel like I'm just getting to the -- getting to match play is the hard part, and then if you can get through there, just play hard and play your way through.   
 Q.  Obviously you've been successful in match play at the junior level.  What kind of -- how will you draw on that experience?  How will that help you here?  
DAVIS RILEY: Right.  You know, it really gives me a lot of confidence going into the rest of the tournament.  I think I'm 16 and 2 in match play in USGA events, so if I can just continue that good play, I think I'll have a good chance.
