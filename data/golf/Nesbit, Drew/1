Q. Obviously a pretty strong finish and there was a lot of excitement there amongst your, I guess, fan club, family, friends.  Talk about that finish, 6-under in the last eight?
DREW NESBIT: You know, what I just really wanted to make the cut.  This is my first PGA TOUR event and I made a bogey on eight, nine and ten, and then I was kind of down in the dumps a bit.
But a couple "let's go" from the fans kept me going, and made a birdie on 11.  Made a birdie on 12 and I birdied 13, as well, and that kept me going.
Then I probably hit the best shot of my life on 16.  I had 229 to a front flag and I had to slice it about 30 yards and it landed perfect, about four feet from the hole.  I made that.
And then I obviously struggled a bit on the chip on 18 but I happened to make that putt, and that probably is going to make me make the cut.
Q. It will be close.  There's probably a pretty good chance.  Have you been in this position before, and had a finish like that in that atmosphere?
DREW NESBIT: That actually happened once before.  A little different atmosphere, a little different finish.  I was playing a U.S. Junior qualifier and I made a 10 on the first hole and I made five birdies on the next seven and ended up qualifying, two rounds in the day.  But to start 5-over through one, and make it, good playing, I kind of related to that.
Q. So it's not a new experience but obviously on a different level.
DREW NESBIT: There's no level higher than this.
Q. So what will you do now while you're sitting around waiting to see if that's the number?
DREW NESBIT: Just have lunch with my family and just hang out.  Say thank you to everybody and hopefully it's good enough.
