   ALESSANDRO TADINI: Lovely golf today, especially putting, because maybe 26, 27 putts. But my long game was very good, because I get a lot of balls at the flag, and when it wasn't three, four metres -- maybe I am very happy for my putting, it is continuing from last week, because also last week putting was all week good. Maybe these greens, I like it. 

 Q. The putting is good because there are very good approach shots, so you're not having too many long distance? 
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: No, putting is good, because I put the regular shot, the ball on the green, close, and I make the putts. 

 Q. Is this as good as it was in Korea? 
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: I played very good the first two days but this time maybe better. 

 Q. A lot of work between playing in Korea and other events with some further bad weather. 
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: It was a little bit but I work with my psychologist a little bit and my coach, also, on the long game. It's much better now. 

 Q. What did your psychologist say? 
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: I beginning in start of the season in January and it's good. I don't do much but now it's coming.
 
 Q. What has he told you? Has he told you to be a bit more positive, a bit more aggressive? 
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: Always positive, forget my bad holes before.
