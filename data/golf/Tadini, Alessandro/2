   ALESSANDRO TADINI: This morning is beginning without wind. I make seven holes without wind, and then I started good.   
 After 11 holes, it's coming wind, very strong, and last seven, eight holes, it's difficult play. It's difficult with the wind against, it's very difficult. I lost two shots in the last five holes, but I think each player lost a shot, because 18 is very difficult.   
 But I am happy, as different as yesterday is to today, I make 32 putts and yesterday 29, only is the difference because the long game was good, also, today.   
  
  Q. With this wind strength, how much difference is there in the club that you're using, say, at the 18th?   
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: 18 yesterday, I played driver and 7-iron. Today I am missing fairway and then second shot is very, very difficult. It was 3-wood but no chance for the green. A double-bogey, is too early to finish there, and bogey is okay.  
  
  Q. I guess you have to be pleased to be 6-under par knowing this wind is going to be here for the rest of the day.   
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: Yeah, maybe I finish 6-under; today, I don't know if -- I hope it's coming windy today, because for other players play in the afternoon, it difficult.   
  
  Q. Tell us how satisfying it is to be on that leaderboard when it's been so long away from the top.   
 ALESSANDRO TADINI: Yeah, it's a long time I'm not on the leaderboard on The European Tour, but now I am there and I want to last for the whole week.
