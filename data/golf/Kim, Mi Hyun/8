  Q. You had a really strong round but a couple bogeys.   
 MI HYUN KIM: I work out a lot, so I'm feeling strong and my tee shots are getting longer and longer than last year.   
 So now I feel more comfortable and this morning I feel good about the swing. So my driver, every time I hit some fairways and just made a couple mistakes but happy with the day.   
  
  Q. When was the knee surgery?  
 MI HYUN KIM: Last December.   
  
  Q. Feeling strong now?   
 MI HYUN KIM: I feel a little stronger.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your position going into the weekend?   
 MI HYUN KIM: Lorena is a strong player and she hits it far, and every time she hits -- even if she hits fairway, she only hit like short iron. I try, I'm always behind her.  
  
  Q. What was it like playing with Annika for two days?   
 MI HYUN KIM: I like to play with her. I like to look at her tempo and her swing.   
 No. 16 was downwind and the tee shot, it switched into the wind and so the wind kind of make me a little confused on the tee shot. That's why I made mistake -- (inaudible).   
  
  Q. What did you do there?   
 MI HYUN KIM: Bogey.   
  
  Q. How did you make bogey?  
 MI HYUN KIM: My tee shot, it was good.   
 Hit a little right, into bunker. Actually, I can't make the bunker shot on the green, so only the chip shot and 12 feet.   
  
  Q. A lot of sand in the bunkers this week?  
 MI HYUN KIM: Yeah, I don't like the sand. It used to be lighter sand.  
  
  Q. Is there anything wrong with your wrist?   
 MI HYUN KIM: A little sore, a little sore.   
  
  Q. Are the fairways a little soft?  
 MI HYUN KIM: I don't know if they put water, but fairways are very wet this year. I'm not a long hitter.   
  
  Q. What are you doing well?   
 MI HYUN KIM: Just hit some putts, make some putts, I've been working on my short game.
