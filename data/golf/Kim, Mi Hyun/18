 MI-HYUN KIM:  Actually, my shot is better than yesterday, and then my putting is much better than yesterday.  So a lot of putt is -- after Tuesday and Wednesday Pro-Am I practice that line many times, so when I get there I'm -- I feel more confident with the putt, that's why I can make, maybe.

 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  All right.  Questions? 

 Q.  On 18, how long was that putt? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  35 feet. 

 Q.  You threw your ball into the gallery.  Did somebody call for it, or did you just do that instinctively? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Yeah, somebody ask to throw the ball. 

 Q.  Somebody called and asked for it? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Is that who you threw it to? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  I tried to throw it there and it was a hook.  Other guy gets it, my ball. 

 Q.  You showed quite a bit of emotion after making that putt.  Is that something that is kind of unusual for you?  Do you tend to be more -- not as -- 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  That is nature. 

 Q.  You did a little jump afterwards. 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  That was the nature of my emotions after long putt. 

 Q.  You were talking yesterday about how the greens were a little mushy, at least for your taste.  Were they a little more to your liking today? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  I just worry about the more softer and more slow yesterday after rain.  But it didn't feel, you know, that much slow.  Still feel soft, but not bad, I think. 

 Q.  You were playing in front of a large gallery.  Are you comfortable with that (No microphone.) 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  I been here nine years, so I play with Natalie many times, and Paula many times, three times, and then more famous LPGA player. 
 I been playing with them, you know Betsy King, Lopez, so you know, I'm used to that.  Even I been -- when I play in Korea I have more gallery than here. 

 Q.  Earlier in the week you talked about that your knee tends to bother you when the weather gets cold.  Any concern going into tomorrow with what is supposed to be kind of less than ideal weather, maybe rainy cold weather? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Until yesterday my knees is okay.  But in the morning, this morning, my knee's getting bad so I take pill before when I play.  So it is a little helping -- that pill is a little helping for me. 
 But I feel -- my knee feels, you know, rain coming tomorrow. 

 Q.  Is that something that concerns you, though? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Uh-huh.  I feel a little bit hurt, so that means maybe rain tonight or tomorrow coming. 

 Q.  Did you injure your knee?  How come you have problems with it? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Yeah.  But like six years ago I checked the doctor, and the doctor say I need surgery.  But I don't want to surgery, and then after that I need to rest like four to six months, can't play.  So I don't want to do that.  I just want to take pill. 

 Q.  But did you fall or twist it or snap anything? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  When I young I try to run fast, but I just slippery, so that's why my knee is bad. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Always been that way? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Yeah. 

 Q.  You had issues with your putter yesterday.  How did you feel about your putter today? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Yesterday I missed like two -- I missed 3-feet putt two times, so I'm not feel good with the putter. 
 After the round I practice a lot with my putting.  Right now it's much better than that. 

 Q.  You had three early birdies on first five holes, then you had a stretch of seven straight pars.  What was going through your mind as the pars were rattling off but you weren't adding birdies? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  We have a lot of birdie chance, you know.  Course is short.  But you know, that Par 5 is like Par 4.  We feel like Par 4, so when I get birdie at the Par 5 it's not big happy, though. 
 But, when I trying to keep make birdie, but I didn't make the putt, you know, uphill, 13th hole.  But No. 13 is most tough hole, but when was there my putt is downhill, seven feet downhill and a little bit, you know, hook lie.  But when I make that putt it's more -- I feel more confidence and happy, though. 

 Q.  Now, this course is known as being a shot-making course.  But with a number of people going for the win, how aggressive do you have to be tomorrow? 
 MI-HYUN KIM:  Everybody try to win.  You never guess who's going to win tomorrow.  You know, I will try to do my best but, even I miss the win it doesn't matter because we have a lot of tournaments this season.
