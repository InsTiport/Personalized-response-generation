Q. You must be pleased with your play this week. 
 MI HYUN KIM: Yes, I played very solid the last four days.
  
And this weekend was kind of windy, so I had to make, I was trying to  
make a lot of pars and give us some chances on the, you know, around  
the green. But, yeah, I'm very pleased to be finished this  
close. 
 
  
Q. What were the playing conditions like? Obviously much  
more windy today, was it a lot harder today because of the wind?
 MI HYUN KIM: Yeah, this morning was really windy. And the scores, I thought the scores were going to be low, I mean high today. 

  
But Inbee played very steady golf all day. She was behind our  
group, so I tried my best and.
 
  
Q. Are you surprised at how well she was able to play in these  
conditions?

We played a practice round together, so we knew that she's going to play well and I'll try my best. And I mean she did an awesome job, you know. I don't think she made any bogeys until the 17th. So I'm very proud of her.
