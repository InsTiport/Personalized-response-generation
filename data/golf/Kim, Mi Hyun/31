JOEL LAMP:  We have Mi Hyun Kim here in the interview room.

1-under par round today.  17 pars, one birdie.  Just your general thoughts on the round, you shot 1-under par.  Talk about the pressure of being the overnight leader and now sitting here in second by yourself right now.  Talk about your feelings now at the midway point.
MI HYUN KIM:  I had a lot of quality shots every hole but I didn't make many birdie putts.  My feeling is comfortable.  My putting is comfortable and my shot is where I aim.  I didn't make a lot of putts, but I'm still happy with my score and I'm happy with my play.
JOEL LAMP:  With 17 pars, how many times did you have to get up-and-down today?
MI HYUN KIM:  Not many times.  I missed maybe eight times birdie chance, but I just lip out.  I feel my putting is working.
Q.  You're sitting one shot back of the lead right now, how do you feel about being in contention for a major right now?
MI HYUN KIM:  Actually everybody want to win majors.  Also I want to win major because it's an important tournament, and my parents say -- my parents told me if you win the major, you can marry.  So I have to win the major.  (Laughter.) So if I have a good chance to win -- give it a try.
JOEL LAMP:  Have you got a guy picked out then?
MI HYUN KIM:  No.  (Laughing).
