Q.   (Inaudible)?
MI HYUN KIM:  I was ahead very good.  Just hit at the pin, very good club.  The greens is so hard.  I didn't think over the green.

Q.   What was the other?
MI HYUN KIM:  14, 15, 17.

Q.   14 a trap also?
MI HYUN KIM:  No, no, just over the green.

Q.   It was a very hard day out there from the standpoint of heat, humidity, a very hard course.  A lot of the players weren't able to hold it together mentally or physically for 18 holes.  How were you able to get around without a bogey? 
MI HYUN KIM:  I don't know.  Just concentration.  I just think smart game.  Sometimes left side of the pin, but we just hit center of the green, middle of the green.  I had a lot of good putts out there. 

Q.   Was the heat bothering you at all?
MI HYUN KIM:  Just a little bit.  But two days I played afternoon, late tee time.  The greens were so bad because greens are firm, you know, lot of spike marks.  I missed a couple putts, but I made a lot of putts, so it's okay. 

Q.   Did you watch the leaderboard at all?  Were you aware you had kind of moved up around everybody?
MI HYUN KIM:  Sometimes.  Some hole I look at leaderboard.  You know, couple player play early tee times, you know, Danielle Ammaccapane and Hee-Won Han, they play good.  They just play early tee times, I think better than us.

Q.   What happened at Rochester?  What did you learn from Rochester? 
MI HYUN KIM:  Rochester?  You know, just first round and second round, third round, I just  -- I'm very confident.  But after Saturday, I couldn't sleep that night, Saturday night.  I just, you know, lead by five shots, but I just worry about my shot, putting.  I don't know. 

Q.   Mi Hyun, when I talked to you in Toledo, you had planned to withdraw from this tournament.  I was wondering after your win at Youngstown, did you think Ohio might be good for you, to come to this tournament?
MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah (laughter). 

Q.   Was it that simple?
MI HYUN KIM:  We just think, you know, more chance.

Q.   Three-day tournament.
MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, three-day tournament.  We have more chance to win.

Q.   Did you decide before your win or after?
MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, before the win.

Q.   What are you going to have to do tomorrow?
MI HYUN KIM:  Tomorrow?  We have to be smart.  Very hot out there, so we have (inaudible), concentration. 

Q.   Somebody wanted me to ask you whether KTF stands for Korea Team Fighting, which I think was the soccer motto in the World Cup.
MI HYUN KIM:  This is a Korean telecom like AT&T, Sprint, like that.  Lot of people ask me just the age.  They just not interest in my sponsor, just they ask me  -- a lot of people ask me my age because I like ponytail (laughter).  Some people think I'm 12 years amateur player.
