   PAM WARNER:  Thanks for joining us again today.  Great round out there today.  You shot 5-under and are currently at 9-under overall.  Can you start by talking about your round?  
 MI HYUN KIM:  Course is way different than yesterday.  I mean, I practice Tuesday nine hole and then Wednesday Pro-Am, and yesterday, yesterday course was so dry and firm and fast. 
 It wasn't so good for me, but today when I play on the course, the fairways are very soft and greens are soft.  Greens was so slow and my shot -- I have a lot of birdie chance, but I didn't make the putt because the green was so different. 
 PAM WARNER:  Can we go over your scorecard? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  No. 12, 110 yards, pitching wedge 7 feet. 
 13, I made -- 13, three putts from 25 feet. 
 Birdie on 14, 95 yards, pitching wedge, 7 feet. 
 16, 9 yards, pitching wedge, 6 feet. 
 18, 135 yards, 9-iron, 5 feet.  My second shot was short and chipping 6 feet, 2-putt. 
 PAM WARNER:  What did you hit with your second shot? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  2 - 5-iron.  Second shot 5-iron like 30 feet, 2-putt. 
 PAM WARNER:  And then 5? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  195 yards, 7-iron, 30 feet, 2-putt. 
 PAM WARNER:  And birdie on 6? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  110 yards, pitching wedge, 2 feet. 
 PAM WARNER:  Questions. 

 Q.  I guess I was confused.  You're at 9-under? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  9-under. 

 Q.  Did you bogey the last hole? 
 PAM WARNER:  No, she bogeyed 13. 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, 13.  9-under. 

 Q.  You were making most of your putts and really your only two-putts were 20 to 30 feet.  Are you being hard on yourself? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  30 feet, 2-putt is easy to most LPGA player.  I'm not a long hitter, so if I play good here -- if I play good in LPGA I have to make a lot of putts. 
 But my shot wasn't so good today, like many time like 7 feet, 10 feet birdie chance, you know. 

 Q.  You said the course was very different out there - was it wetter? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Way different. 

 Q.  Not drying out? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Nope. 

 Q.  So it's not dry? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  No.  Actually, you know, I made a No. 1 bogey.  I made a bogey at the No. 1, because when I practice round and then Pro-Am, even yesterday, we have to hit -- my second shot I have to hit front of the green. 
 If I hit the green, it wasn't rolling over the green.  But I tried to hit the front of the green and it just stop there. 
 So I think most player, you know, No. 1, most player was short, I think, today. 

 Q.  Great play today and great play this week.  You've only made two bogeys so far this week.  That's what have to do on this course is make a lot of birdies and keep the bogeys down.  Do you like your chances going into this weekend? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  You never know.  I'll try.  You never know who can get the win this week, but I'll try.  You know, just hopefully no rain tonight and tomorrow.  After rain the course is way different for me. 

 Q.  You also won three weeks ago.  You got to be riding a wave of momentum coming into this week; is that true? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah.  After won, you know, I feel more confidence, but my body is not good.  Actually, I have some kind of virus in my stomach Tuesday so I take pill before when I play.
