MI-HYUN KIM: We'll do the score card first. 
MODERATOR:  Okay, we'll do the score card first. 
(Score card done.)
MODERATOR:  We'll take some questions. 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: A couple tournaments I wasn't playing good, I had a stomach problem, and I played bad since the Corning.  So, now I feel better, and I changed the caddy.  I changed the caddy the first week this week.  He's doing good, and he helps a lot. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: I don't know.  I don't remember.  Maybe, yeah.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Maybe 2.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: No, actually, I don't care about the cut.  I just want to try to get to the top 10 or 5.  I don't want to think about the cut.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: Yeah, and I shoot maybe 4 or 5 under, and then the second day, it was very hot that time.  I went to the hospital that day.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: No, no, no. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: 99.

Q.  Can you tell us about your round today?  5 under is a pretty good score.  Did you see it coming?
MI-HYUN KIM: Yesterday it was fun.  I played with the Korean guys.  It was very fun.  I just don't worry about the front 9, par 3, number 4 and 7, because the greens are tough and the affairs are long.  I made a birdie.  It was good for me. 
MODERATOR:  Any more questions? 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: I try on the course to have more confidence and more focus, and my father teach me, you know, he says to keep my head up.  It's good for me.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: Yeah.  I don't know.  I thought maybe a couple.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: No  -- yeah.  A whole lot. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM: When I started today, I just  -- my goal is 2 under or 3 under, play better.  It was better, better than I thought, and the short game is better than I thought, so I made a good score.
MODERATOR:  Any more questions?  Thank you.
MI-HYUN KIM: Thank you.
