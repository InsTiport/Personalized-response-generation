  Q.  Just talk about your round today and what went right for you out there.   
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know what, my swing is working good, and then my short game is good, especially like front nine I had five birdies.  Then I have more chances at birdie but I didn't make the putts.  But 67, I like that score.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible.)   
 MI HYUN KIM:  A little bit tough but a little more fun.  I played with Paula and she played really good, and when she made a birdie chance, I made a birdie chance.  Then I made a birdie chance after that and then she made a birdie chance, too.  So it's just a little bit kind of a -- looks like match play and a little more exciting.   
  
  Q.  On No. 3 you almost holed out your approach shot with a wedge.  Talk a little bit about that.  Did you think it was actually going to go in?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know what, I changed back to my old irons, so I just figured out the yardage this morning, and then I was working a lot and a practiced a lot with the irons, and after that my irons is working good.  Every time my shot has like a lot of birdie chance, and then my swing is working very good right now.   
  
  Q.  Do you have to be aggressive in this format?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know what, I like stroke play better than this kind of play.  But this is a little more fun.  After final round we need a little more luck.
