 Q.  Was it hard to clear your head after a double bogey? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, like a little bit unlucky, after second shot 18th hole.  It was plugged in the bunker, and it's such a tough bunker shot. 
 Then after that I have like a makable putt last putt, and I thought it was in, but it broke more. 
 So sad after the 18th hole, but I made a birdie here. 
 Anyway, everybody's score is zero. 

 Q.  What club did you hit? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Right here, 17th hole?  5. 

 Q.  5-iron? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, like a rescue 5. 

 Q.  Hybrid? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Hybrid, yeah. 

 Q.  When the ball was plugged in the bunker on 18, what happened after that? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  In the rough, just like five yards. 

 Q.  How long was the par putt on 18, I mean the bogey putt? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Kind of like this, six feet, seven feet. 

 Q.  Overall how do you feel like you're playing? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know what, my shot was so wonderful like the first -- before 14th hole, and then after the 14th hole I just feel like my swing isn't working good, and I shoot 4-under after nine holes -- no, I shoot 5-under after 12 holes, so my shot is good and my short game was good. 
 But after I made a bogey at the 14th hole, I was just like a little bit scared, you know, because I needed a little bit of luck today.  Everybody shoot very good.  I was a little scared after the bogey.
