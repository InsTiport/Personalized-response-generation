THE MODERATOR:  You're one behind Aree going into tomorrow.  Can you talk about how you feel about how you played today, how you feel going into tomorrow?
MI-HYUN KIM:  I miss a couple birdie chance.  I don't have a birdie at the par 5.  Actually, the course, par 5, easy to make birdie, but I miss the birdie chance.  Yesterday the green a little firm.  Today they felt good.

I'm just a little confused at the green start.  Sometimes I hit so good, ball going to make the backspin.  Sometimes I hit a little hard, ball just stick over the pin.  Little confused.  But I like my shot.  Putting is very good.  I feel more confident.

THE MODERATOR:  We're probably going to get some more rain tonight.  The greens will be soft again tomorrow.  It will probably rain tomorrow, too.  How will you play the course tomorrow?
MI-HYUN KIM:  I don't know.  You know, today course is very long for me.  I have a lot of 9-under shot, 7-under shot.  A little bit hard, but I will try.
Q.  You had no 3-putts today.
MI-HYUN KIM:  No, I have a bogey.
Q.  You say you missed a couple of birdies.
MI-HYUN KIM:  Birdie chances.  Greens a little bumpy.  Some greens a little bumpy.  I had couple good shot, but I missed it.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM:  I don't even know (inaudible).  No. 16, par 3.  The green was very long.  I tried to hit in front of the green, then roll back.  But today, I hit so perfect, and then just two yards maybe.  Miss the putt, lip out.
Q.  What was the best part of your game not jut today but the whole week?  Everything good?

Q.  How do you think Aree will handle being in the lead tomorrow?  She's played well at a number of tournaments.  She's only 18.  How do you think she'll do?
MI-HYUN KIM:  You know what, I play one time with her.  And she so sweet, you know.  She's good person.  She's good player.  I don't want to, you know, fight with Aree.  We just have fun together.  I don't want to think about the other player.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM:  No (laughter).
