  Q.  Mi, talk about your match today, when did you take control and how did it go?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  The past couple of days, my short game was still working good, and my putter wasn't so good.  And then I had a pretty good match today.  Rachel has a good short game.  We were all-square up to the 13th or 14th hole and then she had a little bit of a mistake and that's why I won.   
  
  Q.  What was the mistake?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  She just missed a couple shots, swing.   
  
  Q.  Your game has been remarkably consistent this week.  Talk a little bit about that.   
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know, I'm still a little bit working on my swing because my swing was like so big.  Right now I'm trying to change it to a more compact swing.  That's why I hit the ball a little farther than before.  That's why I'm a little more confident with my play.   
  
  Q.  Are you hitting the ball further now with the compact swing?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  How many fairways and greens did you hit today?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  I'm not counting, but I hit almost -- I had a pretty good swing, I hit pretty good shots.  I missed the green just past the pin maybe, just over.   
  
  Q.  Looking ahead to this afternoon, how do you feel this afternoon with another 18?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  I don't know, I'm just ready to go.
