 Q.  You played very well on the back 9. 
 MI HYUN KIM:  I know my shot is good, maybe after 5 hole I feel more comfortable with my short game. 

 Q.  What do you think with the wind and weather and everything the score might be at the end of today?  Do you think you put yourself in a good position for tomorrow? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, yeah.  I think I heard it's getting worse tomorrow, weather getting worse tomorrow, so hopefully the weather is better and windy is more than the morning, may be in the afternoon. 
 So I just have to keep work and keep it down. 

 Q.  Thank you very much.
