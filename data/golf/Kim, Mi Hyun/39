LAURA NEAL:  Why don't we go over your scorecard.
MI HYUN KIM:   No.  2, driver was left side and hit the 5-wood, right side bunker and then maybe six feet, 2-putt. 
No. 7, 71 yards, middle wedge two, feet. 
14, 48 yards, middle wedge, two feet. 
15, 161, seven feet. 
17, 85, pitching wedge, five feet.
LAURA NEAL:  Great round.  Is this confidence continuing from winning? 
MI HYUN KIM:   I wasn't feeling good  -- course is long because it is a little bit into the wind.  A couple holes having some trouble, like in the bunker and short of the green and I just chipping.

Q.  What do you think about Scotland golf, links golf?
MI HYUN KIM:   I like the links course.  Like a little tough, but I wasn't hit good and every shot, if it goes straight.  I like the greens here. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MI HYUN KIM:   No.  (Laughs).

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MI HYUN KIM:   Just the weather.   Last year rain was very heavy, and I missed a lot of putts, a lot of shots last year, so hopefully the weather is good.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MI HYUN KIM:   This year?  I don't know.  Try to improve my game. 
You know, I couldn't win last year just that, you know, maybe three times, four times, second, first, but I try to get win.  So a lot of Korean media want to get win, and, of course it's hard. 
LAURA NEAL:  They must be very happy with you now? 
MI HYUN KIM:   Yes.
