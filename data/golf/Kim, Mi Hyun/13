 Q.  Tough match out there, take me through what happened and what the difference was. 
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know, it was just bad shots today, I don't feel good before the start of the round. 

 Q.  You didn't feel very good, something you ate? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  No.  I just think when I wake up, my back is hurt.  Kind of a funny shot out there, I had a lot of funny shots out there and after 15 holes, I just picked it up a little bit.  My short game, I lost my feel in my short game, too. 

 Q.  Something in your lower back, maybe you didn't sleep well? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  I don't know.  I don't know what happened but just wake up in the morning and back was so sore. 

 Q.  Was it your lower back? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah. 

 Q.  So you were fighting your swing for 14 holes until you figured it out on 15.  What happened on 15 where you were able to figure it out? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Just trying to swing tempo a little bit slower.  But, I don't know, I'm not helping a lot. 

 Q.  How are you feeling right now? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Just a little tired a little bit. 

 Q.  Is it going to affect you this afternoon?
