  Q.  How do you feel about your match?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  You know, it was a tough day today.  She was like making it every time and playing so good.   
  
  Q.  What was going well for you?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  For me I'm always putting good.  You know, match-play strategy, I'm more confident with my putter.   
  
  Q.  Was the wind playing a factor at all?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  A little bit but I'm not worried about the wind because the course is always long for me, especially two, three years.   
  
  Q.  Looking forward to tomorrow, what are you most excited about?   
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, I don't know, I only beat two players last year, so my goal is to move past that and win tomorrow.
