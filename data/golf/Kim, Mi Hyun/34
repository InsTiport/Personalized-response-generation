THE MODERATOR:  Thanks for coming and joining us.  Right now you're 7-under, you're in second place.  If you could go ahead and tell us about your day, and we'll take some questions from there.  General thoughts on the day.
MI-HYUN KIM:  I wasn't play good for the season, then maybe five tournaments Top 10, four time Top 10.  I was hit good.  My shot is good.  Short game is good.  I very feel confident.

THE MODERATOR:  Did you do anything differently?  I think you're fourth on the Money List right now.  You were saying last year it wasn't quite as good of a year as you'd like to have.  Did you work on anything on the off-season?
MI-HYUN KIM:  Last year, wintertime, I was work very hard, I train hard, hit lot of ball.

I've been Thailand in last few winters with a trainer, with all my teacher.  He changes the thing little bit.  I hit little bit farther than before.  I train hard, work out hard.

THE MODERATOR:  Questions.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MI-HYUN KIM:  Yeah, maybe 20 yard driver, one club, iron.
Q.  So far this week, the last two days, what's working best for you?  Which part of your game is giving you the best results?
MI-HYUN KIM:  I think I hit good, putting is good, short game is good.  Everything.
Q.  Confidence is good?
MI-HYUN KIM:  Yup.  I like this green, little faster.  Last year, (inaudible) greens a little slow.  These greens a little faster.  I feel more confident.
