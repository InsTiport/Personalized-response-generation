MI HYUN KIM: No. 
NEAL REID:  No.  Any good pars.

MI HYUN KIM:  No, we have a couple chance for birdie, but 
I missed the putt. 
NEAL REID:  Are you happy with how you played today 
and where you stand at 4-under?

MI HYUN KIM:  You know, I just had very good shot and very 
good short game today.  So I'm very enjoying the round.  
And I play with my friend, she is very friendly.  So we just 
had fun. 
NEAL REID:  Questions? 
 Q.  I just saw the five or six holes of your game and my 
impression is that you could have easily been 8-under.  
You missed a lot of birdies.  Do you feel that way? 

MI HYUN KIM:  We just come from nine, you know, I had 
couple chances for birdie, but I read good and my putt 
stroke is very good.  But just some lipouts.  Like maybe bad 
luck. 
 Q.  Is there a reason why Koreans are enjoying so 
much success this year and even last year on the LPGA? 


MI HYUN KIM:  I don't know.  They just are hard workers.  
We just play golf hard and some Korean player is good, 
next week we practice hard more.  So we just try to play 
best game.  Like they travel with the parents.  The parents 
who want to hard work, so. 
Q.  (Inaudible.) 

MI HYUN KIM:  Junior program? 
Q.  Is there any junior programs for golf in Korea? 


MI HYUN KIM:  I don't know.  Maybe not. 
 Q.  You said that you had some problems on the 
greens missing some putts.  Were the greens tougher 
today, if we compare with yesterday? 

MI HYUN KIM:  I think the green is, today the green is a little 
softer than yesterday.  The green is a little bit slower.  So 
some putts -- I think that some putts are past the hole, but 
my putt is just right there.  Just short of the hole or 
something. 
NEAL REID:  Okay.  Thank you. 

MI HYUN KIM:  Thank you.
