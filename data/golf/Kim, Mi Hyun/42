MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  First hole just a third shot little sand wedge to 10 feet on the first.  Birdie.  Number three, hit a little  pitching wedge to three feet.  Number 6 we had a double bogey.  In the left rough off the tee.  Second shot was 5-wood into the bunker short of the green. Only just managed to get it out of the bunker and then chipped on and missed a 10 foot bogey putt.  Left it on the edge.  Number 8, hit 9-wood and three putt.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  First putt was like 35 feet.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Second putt was four feet.  Two feet?

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Three feet.  I say four, she says three.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Number 10, hit the green in two.  Second shot was a 3-wood and two putts for the birdie.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  First putt was 30 feet. Par 14, the par-5, hit the green in two, 3-wood.  Eagle putt was 20 feet.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Left it about one foot short.  Pars in.

MI HYUN KIM:  I like second place, but I make mistake number six.  I lost the tee shot.  The position is a very good lie so I can make, I think I can make on the green second shot.  But I just didn't make it.  I make mistake.  I hit it bad.  And next hole, maybe after next hole I did three putt.  And then I went to the back nine and I come to the back nine and so I just missed a lot of short bird putts.  That's all.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  It stopped 30, 40 yards short of the green and we were right in the base of it.  So after that second shot we were struggling to make it went in the trap.

MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, my ball just made it on to the green.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  It just went left side of the trap and took a hell of a bounce and went into the trap.  So we really couldn't get the green.  Like she could have hit it 10 times and would not hit the green with the third shot.  It was in the face and we just had to get it out 20 yards.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  But it was a good lie in the rough.  From the tee shot, it was, she feels like she hit a bad shot there.  Kind of hit it thin.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  How many women play in Korea?

MI HYUN KIM: A lot.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Like a number?  Can you  speak about golf?

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  Are you talking about professionals or just population?

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  The sport is very popular very big.  A lot of women and men play golf.

MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah.  Golf is very expensive in Korea.  But a lot of people like to play the golf.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  It's still very expensive.  But not like Americans, like Japan.

Q.  Were you watching the leaderboard all day and trying to keep up a little bit?

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  She always looks at the board.  Some players don't.  She does.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  It's hard for her to say.

MI HYUN KIM:  I hope win.  I wanted to win.  But if you are another player from Korea, the Korea, very proud.

MI HYUN KIM (Caddie Speaking):  If she doesn't win she wants another Korean to win.

MI HYUN KIM:  Um-hum.  Yeah.


Q.  (Inaudible.)

MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah.  We just sit there.  We just sit together out there on the ceremony.  So we just talked a little bit.  And about other things, not golf.  Just other things.  Like boyfriend and mom and dad.

MI HYUN KIM:  Thank you.
