  Q. Can you take me through 4-under today, what was working well for you out there?  
 MI HYUN KIM: I just fixed a little swing yesterday, it wasn't working. So my first hole and second hole, pretty good second shots I had but I missed the putt on both of them. I feel like after, that I feel like, oh, not today, not today.   
 And then after that, my putting stroke is getting better, and after that, the par 5, I got three little long putts I made, 15 feet maybe. So after that, I got more confidence with my short game and I had a good time.   
  
  Q. What do you think is going to be the key for you over the next two days to keep shooting these low scores?  
 MI HYUN KIM: I don't know, I have got a cold right now and my condition is bad, and my ankle is bad, too. I don't know, I'm just going to keep trying to do my best.   
 But, you know, who knows.   
  
  Q. What was it like to play in that group today with Se Ri and Grace?   
 MI HYUN KIM: I feel like back to when we played junior, you know. So I had a very good time, and having fun we just talked a lot with each other. I don't know, just like more fun to play.  
  
  Q. What's it like always when you come back here to Korea and you get to play in front of these fans?  
 MI HYUN KIM: My last time when I played here is 2008. It was so cold, but we have good weather today and hopefully you know I wish the last two days we have good weather, too. But you know a lot of friends for me and they are cheering me a lot, and they are helping a lot, too. So I'm very happy with that.
