 Q.  Take us through what happened there on No. 9 today.  
BRONTE LAW: I hit a good drive, set myself up for a short club in.  I really couldn't believe how short it was playing.  I even said to my caddie, is 9-iron really enough?  And I just pulled it out and I hit it because I was like -- you could stand there all day discussing this, and the wind sometimes I think you can overthink it too much, and I grew up in the wind being back in England, and sometimes it just comes down to feel.  As soon as I hit it off the club face, I knew it was good.  It was just a matter of whether it got a good bounce.  It was exactly where I was trying to aim it.  And yeah, it went in.  I couldn't see it, but --   
 Q.  I was going to ask, did it bounce off on the green?  
BRONTE LAW: I have no idea.  You just go and stand on 9 and ask the people there.  I couldn't see.   
 Q.  Big roar?  
BRONTE LAW: Yeah, not too bad.  I don't care.  It's about the score on the scorecard, right?
