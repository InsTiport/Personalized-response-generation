Q. You told Tom last night that your dad uses boxing metaphors to try and teach you how to handle the emotions of a game.  How much of a fight did that feel like today?
BRONTE LAW: Oh, my gosh, the biggest fight of my life I think.  Yeah, I mean, I started struggling with my driver a little bit out there and I had to really stay strong and just play to my advantages, just really try and find the fairways.
I was hitting my irons really good.  As long as I found the fairways I was going to create some chances.  Ended up doing that towards the end.  Yeah, feels amazing.
Q. Some of the break you got with the wayward drives, did at any moment you feel like maybe this was destiny to you?
BRONTE LAW: I don't know about destiny.  I don't really believe so much in that.  I believe in hard work and determination.  I really stayed so focused out there today.  Obviously my caddie, Jeff, did a great job keeping me calm.
I guess after San Fran it really gave me perspective that I can compete at the top.  I came in this week with the sole intention of getting that one better.  It feels really good.
