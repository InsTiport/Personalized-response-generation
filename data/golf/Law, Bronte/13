 Q.  Impressive performance to this point, great position, but how proud are you to get through 54 holes without a single bogey on the scorecard?  
BRONTE LAW: Yeah, that's always good.  But it would be nice to have a couple more putts go in here and there.  Played solid golf all day today.  But yeah, left a couple short in the jaws and couldn't quite get the speed of the greens today.  Matching the pace and the line out here is really important, and just struggled.  Sometimes it's like that.  Was pretty pleased with my stroke overall but yeah, you've got to hole some putts.   
 Q.  What relief did it feel like to see this one finally drop in?  
BRONTE LAW: My reaction here just kind of shows it all.  It was a long day up to that point.  I didn't really think I could catch a break and create some really good chances and just couldn't capitalize on it.  To finally make that birdie, you know, felt really good.   
 Q.  And this one, as well, the par 3.  Did you feel you were starting to get the speed at this point?  
BRONTE LAW: Yeah, it's funny, I just looked at the leaderboard and seen Ashleigh just dropped a shot and looked at my caddie, like it's time to hole something.  Kind of pleased to see on the back nine, I'm making birdies because tomorrow that will be really important.   
 Q.  Coming in, seeing the scores; what are you feeling right now?  What is the mind-set now heading into Sunday?  
BRONTE LAW: I think the fact that I haven't had any dropped shots is going to help me, if I can continue that tomorrow and start to hole some putts, then I think that I can really rely on the fact that I'm playing solid golf and hopefully can get a low one tomorrow.
