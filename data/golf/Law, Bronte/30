 Q.  Ladies, two wins out of two; you've got to be really happy with your start to this week.  
BRONTE LAW: Yeah, absolutely.  It's always good to win a match, obviously, and especially with us going and having to play Korea this afternoon.  I think it's good to have some momentum, and definitely coming off the back of two wins is going to definitely do that.   
 Q.  Jodi, obviously quality of play today was probably not up to yesterday given the conditions; how different was the golf course playing out there for you?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, it was playing much longer.  There was a couple of par-4s that weren't reachable, so that was interesting.  But it's match play, so it doesn't really matter.  Yeah, I mean, obviously not as many birdies as yesterday, but I think pars win holes today given the rain.  It's good to know that we could have been a lot more up, I think.  We gave -- there's a lot of shots out there that we left out there.   
 Q.  What were the keys to the win today do you think?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Just staying patient with the weather, I think.  Just trying to make pars and just trying to stay steady.   
 Q.  Bronte, obviously with the tight turnaround, nice to finish one ahead of time?  
BRONTE LAW: Absolutely, yeah.  We'll watch everyone else keep battling out there, and hopefully the Korean matches go all the way to 18.
