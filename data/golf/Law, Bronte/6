 Q.  Bronte, you have the most incredible competitive spirit. Sum up how you're feeling right now?  
BRONTE LAW: I don't know. Honestly what happened out there, (inaudible) incredible experience of the day. (Indiscernible) just the best feeling in the world. I love being part of a team. This is exactly what I play this game for.   
I'm not a selfish person. I don't do it for myself. To be able to do it for others and for Beany, in our home, like, yeah, it's really incredible.   
 Q.  You can see it's getting emotional. What about the home support?  
BRONTE LAW: The home support has been phenomenal, honestly. This is nothing I've ever experienced in my whole life. Everyone came out and they've just been phenomenal and they are honestly the 13th member of the team. And they've been screaming all day today. And that makes a massive difference.   
When you can hear them really rooting for you and being loud -- and that's exactly why you play this game. And it just gives you that pep in your step and just keeps you going. And when things go wrong, obviously it wasn't all smooth sailing today, I played some really good golf, but I made some mistakes.   
And when I made those mistakes I just really listened to the crowd; they were cheering me all the way around. And to be able to do it in front of my family and lots of friends is something really special.   
 Q.  There were two hammer blows landed for Europe; you provided one of them. How does it feel?  
BRONTE LAW: Amazing, honestly, to watch Suzann make that putt, like, she's been my idol for so long. And to be able to play behind her and come up the rear is just something like never thought would happen. And, yeah, it's -- words can't really describe how I feel right now.   
 Q.  Were you watching, aware what was going on throughout the day, knowing the situation as you were lining up your approach shot on 18?  
BRONTE LAW: No, I didn't really know what was going ahead. And I was trying to do math and looking at the board. Well, I have to win either way. But then I had no idea what was going on ahead.   
And then I couldn't remember whether it was 14 and a half or 14. So as I was, just get on with your point, win your point, and the rest will be taken care of. And Suzann took care of it.   
 Q.  You were part of a Solheim Cup winning team. What does that mean to you?  
BRONTE LAW: I don't know. Words can't describe it right now. But I know I play with heart and I play in front of a team, I just love being part of the team. It's something about playing Curtis Cups, winning on a team is so special, something you don't get to experience very often.   
I had my first LPGA win this year, and this trumps it by a mile.
