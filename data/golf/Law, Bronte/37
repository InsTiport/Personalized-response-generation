BRONTE LAW: She's like really straight, like enviably straight, like I need some of that.  Yeah, just like -- kind of like plods it around, like fairway, green, occasionally makes a putt, and never really makes any mistakes, which is really a good thing to have on your team. But I think I'm kind of really happy that she's playing Nelly because obviously all the TV cameras are all over them because of the situation --Q. And Jessica is out there.BRONTE LAW: Exactly.  I really hope this is like her time to shine and she pulls through because that would be such a big thing for her.  She's worked really hard freshman year at college and didn't necessarily get all that she deserved from the year.  I think if she pulls through, I'll be super proud of her and be -- it would be like a reward for her from all the effort that she's put in.Q. Are you team captain next year?BRONTE LAW: I don't know.Q. You should be.  I vote for you.BRONTE LAW: We'll soon find out.Q. Who do you have tomorrow?BRONTE LAW: I think Gaby.Q.

The best of the best.BRONTE LAW: Exactly.Q. The top seed was knocked out today.BRONTE LAW: You know, that always happens.Q. I know, but it just kind of shows you the depth of the field, too, though.BRONTE LAW: Yeah, like it's always the same.  The person who's like 64, they're like, well, I just got in, nothing to lose.  I actually have nothing to lose right now, like I didn't play great to get in, so I'm just going to go for everything.Q. Did you --BRONTE LAW: I've been on the other end of that before.
