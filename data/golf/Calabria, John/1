 Q. Take us through the start. Probably No. 6 there that was one swing you would like to have back and maybe that's kind of where it started as far as unraveling?
 JOHN CALABRIA: I don't want anything back. I made a great swing, it let up -- it was gusting on the tee and the wind let up, I hit a 5-iron, just hit a perfect shot right at it, went over the green and made double. Kind of changed the karma for me. 

 Q. Something you really need to have going for you is karma out there. Especially when you play a course like this one with conditions and the wind blowing like this. 
 JOHN CALABRIA: It's a great golf course. 

 Q. When you started the day what's going through your mind?
 JOHN CALABRIA: Just wanted to have a nice time and enjoy the day and enjoy the experience. Play well. And got off to a great start which of course changes everything. Kind of a disappointing finish. 

 Q. It changes things in what way?
 JOHN CALABRIA: It changes the way you feel about what you're doing. All of a sudden having that great start it's difficult not to let your mind say, wow, this is really cool, I've got some game, I'm home, I'm showing off. And it was nice to do that. And by the Grace of God I had a great start and I am thankful for that.
