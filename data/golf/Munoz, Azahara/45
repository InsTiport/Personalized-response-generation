 Q.   A clean sweep for Spain.   How are you guys feeling right now.   You started on Wednesday saying we're the team to beat and you come out and back it up.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I can't even tell you how I feel right now.   It's been such an amazing week for us.   We have had such a good time.   When we knew we won on the 15th green, I almost lost it.   I don't know how I could keep playing because I was going to get a heart attack.   
So it's just super exciting that we won the first ever International Crown and I'm so proud to be from where I am and it's just awesome.   
   
 Q.   Well, you know you play individually and you come out and you do have teammates.   You guys have gone to college together.   You've won NCAA's together.   Then you get to win the first International Crown.   I'm sure there's going to be a lot of celebration tonight for the Spaniards.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You bet.   I think it's just we're so goods as a team because we're just used to, since we were younger, to play together.   I always played with Belen and Carlota.   They were always my foursomes partners.   I don't know.   It just is so special to be on the team with them.   
   
 Q.   So you predicted a win on Wednesday during Golf Channel.   How do you think the 2015 Solheim Cup's going to do?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Well‑‑  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know how it's going to do.  
   
 Q.   Speechless.   Azahara speechless first time ever?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I don't know how it's going to be, but we're just super excited and the four of us, if we're on the team, it would be something really amazing for Spain.
