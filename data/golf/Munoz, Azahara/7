Q. Fantastic play once again. You two have gelled beautifully over the last day and a half so far. What's working so well?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think we just complement each other very well. We enjoy each other's company. And we're both playing really good golf. Charley is a little longer of a hitter than me so that helps us. We just enjoy each other out there. That truly helps.
Q. Americans came back, put a bit of pressure on you on the back nine. But you, held firm. How much does teamwork help in a situation on that?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, 100 percent. We have a great time together, which it's good. And in that wind you just have to stay focused because this golf course is quite tricky, especially in this wind. And a lot of that is there's not going to be a lot of birdies out there. A lot of pars are going to win the holes.
Q. Charley mentioned the wind. Obviously, the conditions. Everyone here today is talking about how strong that wind is. How are you finding it from start to finish?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: We liked it today. It worked out well for us. But it is super tricky. The ball moves a lot. It's really hard to putt. It's hard to stay on the putt. You have to be patient out there. As Charley said, pars are going to win some holes. You just have to beat them by one, so that's it.
