Q. Awesome round.  Seems like this course really suits you.  What are your thoughts about your round today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, it was a really nice day.  I hit a lot of shots really close.  I gave myself lots of birdie chances and I putted really well, so that obviously always helps.
Q. Between your last two rounds last year and first two rounds this year, way under par.  Something that clicked for you?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I mean, it was a year ago.  I really like this golf course.  The fact that it's windy but the greens hold I don't mind so much the wind.  Well, it starts getting to me when the greens are really firm.
I feel like it's kind of open off the tee so it gives me the freedom hit it, and then at the same time the greens have quite a few tiers and I really like small targets.  I think that helps me for the second shots.
Q. You had a lot of good momentum going; four consecutive birdies, made the turn, two back-to-back birdies, par, birdie.  What part of your game do you feel like really came together for you?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think a little bit of everything.  You know, I'm hitting lots of fairways so that gives me the chance to go for the greens, and then my irons too.  But also making nice putts.  I don't know.  I think when you have a 6-under round everything kind of has to click.  I also chipped in on the 3rd hole today, so what helps as well.
Yeah, overall everything was pretty solid.
Q. Has that been the case most of the season?  You've been in contention quite a bit so far.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, it's been really nice.  My long game was really, really good at the beginning of the season.  I'm not hitting the ball as good right now, but still hitting it really good; my putting has improved a lot.
Lately it's been a little bit more my putting than my long game.  Overall, I feel like everything has improved.
