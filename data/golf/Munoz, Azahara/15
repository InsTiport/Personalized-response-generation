 Q.  What a spectacular round to end the Pure Silk Championship for you.  Pardon the pun, but what got so hot out there for you?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, the weather.  So I've been hitting the ball better and better each day but my driver was still not great, so I had to scramble a little bit the last few days.   
Today something clicked on the range.  I was working we my caddie, Mikey, and I got a nice feeling.  Today I been hitting my driver really well so I was always in position, and it's much easier like that.   
 Q.  Feel like it's also a mental game as well.  Did that boost your confidence throughout the round?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, for sure.  Right on the first tee I hit a great drive and then on the third one I hit a great drive; only 5-wood into the green.   
I just had really short clubs into the pins and the greens are getting quite firm.  It's much easier when you have a shorter club in, especially if you're in the fairway.   
 Q.  What can you take away from this tournament to continue on through this long summer stretch?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Just my attitude, I guess.  I been working a lot on it just trying to be more relaxed out there and just let it happen, not force things.  I think it's been working for me all year.  I'm just going to try to keep doing the same thing.
