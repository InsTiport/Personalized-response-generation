Q. 69 today.  Tell us about round one.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, I play pretty good.  I hit lots of fairways, lots of greens, gave myself lots of chances.  You know, it's always hard to make putts on these quick greens, especially if you're above the hole.
I gave myself a lot of opportunities.  I didn't make them all, but made a few.
I'm really happy with the round.
Q. One big change to your season this year.  You changed trainers.  Who is he and tell us the changes he's made to your swing.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Well, his name a Bob Lohr and works at the David Leadbetter Academy up in the Orlando.  I was working with him on my putting last year, but then starting this year we started working with my swing as well.
Not much.  He just wanted me to go back to 2014 when I was playing really well.  He asked me to send him all these swings and literally just go back to that.  I used to be such a good ball-striker and I lost that.
I always try to make my swing perfect.  He said that you hit really good shots with whatever swing it is.  That's what it is.  He just wants me to go back to what I was doing.  That's what I been working on since January.
Q. I see you have the flat stick in your hand.  Just going to the putting green now?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Hitting literally three putts and I'm in.  It's too hot out.  (Laughter.)
