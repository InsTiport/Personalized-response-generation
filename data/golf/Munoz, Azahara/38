 Q.   Great start today, talk me through a bit how it went you slowed.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I still played pretty good.   The putts weren't dropping.   I still hit pretty good putts, especially 17 and 18, I wanted to make one birdie and one just went over the edge.   I'm playing really well, and it's just hard sometimes to get the right yardages.   If you start having just like half‑shots into the greens, it's really hard to control the spin.   
But overall, I felt really good out there, and I didn't make as many putts as the last couple days, but hopefully I'll go now to fit a few putts and we'll figure it out.  
   
 Q.   And the wind didn't affect you yesterday?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It was windy but it didn't really affect me; I cannot blame that.   I cannot give an excuse for that.  
   
 Q.   Where did you lie last year?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I was in the last group going into the final round, maybe a couple back, something like that, three back.   
   
 Q.   Do you quite like the thought of going into the final round tomorrow not actually in the final group and then you can just sneak up?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   To be honest I wish I was leading by seven.  
   
 Q.   Well, if you can't lead by seven‑‑  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   The closer you are to the lead, the better.   I'm playing really well.   I'm right there, four back, and still 18 holes on this golf course, anything can happen.  
   
 Q.   And you know this golf course really well.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, I real will I like it.   It sets up well for me so hopefully I drop a few tomorrow and hopefully I get it going from the beginning.
