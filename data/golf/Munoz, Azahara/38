Q.   7‑under is a fantastic round.   What was the difference from yesterday to today? 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Both days I actually played pretty good.   Yesterday I miss a few short putts that today I didn't, and I still made a few nice 15‑, 20‑footers. 
So you know, I think that was just the difference, and I still hit so many good shots, but it's kind of hard to control the spin on these greens.   So hitting a good shot, it went over, but I ended up making nice par saves I guess.   So it was overall, it was a really easy day of golf.

Q.   Continuing where you left off from last year, because obviously this course suits you.   What is it about the course that suits you so well? 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I don't know, I think sometimes when courses are wide open and stuff, I have a hard time focusing.   And I think this golf course, every tee shot on every shot into the greens, even though the greens are huge, they are all set up in little‑‑ like the green might be 45 yards long, but it's really only 15.   So I think that really helps me focus a little more.
