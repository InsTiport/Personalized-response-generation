Q. It was a tough day, but you scored a great round on a tough day.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: It was quite windy.  It was kind of swirling around and it was kind of hard to know where it was coming from, and I played really well.
Like I made a bogey on 12 hitting a really good shot, and I actually thought it was really good and I get there and it's like 30 yards over the green.
Other than that it was really hard to hit it close.  So I made really nice two putts from like really far away.
Q. A lot of saves.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, exactly, and it was really nice to finish with a birdie.
Q. All in all, you're very pleased with your day.  She had a crazy score to win it.  Did you believe that score was out there?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: No, I actually can't.  She hits it so far and she's so good; so when everything clicks, I can totally see her shooting that score.
But you know, I had in mind shooting 66 and hopefully that would have a chance, but that wouldn't even have a chance, so pretty impressive what she did today.
Q. But overall, brilliant start to the year, first few weeks, it's a great start for you?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, it's really good.  I'm really happy.  Obviously I really wanted to be in contention.
I still played really well today and I'm so happy, three top 5s at the beginning of the year, and I'm going to keep working on the same things and hopefully have a good season.
