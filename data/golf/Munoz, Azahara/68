Q.   Tough day.   You played well.   Ai played better.   Just take me through the day. 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You know, I had a really good front nine.   I was 3‑under.   I made two really, really, really long putts.   I was playing really well.
On the back night nine I just miss my second shot on 10 and I had a really bad lie in the bunker.   Then I think the key point was 14, the par‑5.   My second shot ‑‑ I mean, the fairway is like 50 yards wide, and I was like, you know, it doesn't matter where it goes. 
I wasn't focus, and just missed it in the rough.   The ball was sitting down and I didn't know what it was going to do.   I missed it to the right and bogeyed that one. 
But I hit really good putts; just didn't go in.   On 13 I hit a really nice putt; didn't go in.   14, same thing.   On 15, just short. 
But you know what, it was a really good day.   She just played really well, especially when she needed to.   All I can do is say congratulations to her.

Q.   How good did it feel to be in contention, to feel the pressure coming down the back nine, tied for the lead early on the back nine?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It's really good.   That's what we practice for.   I been missing this.   At the end the year last year I was couple times in the last group, and I love it.   That's why we play golf. 
I can't wait to be in contention again.   Hopefully I learn from today and get the win.

Q.   Are you more frustrated that you weren't able to win or pleased with how you handled yourself and looking forward?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Both, because Ai didn't really give my a chance.   She beat my by four? 

Q.   Yeah.
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I mean, yeah, I made stupid mistakes, and maybe if I hadn't made bogey on that one things would have turned out different. 
But she played really well at the end.   She made really nice putts, amazing up and downs.   It's a little frustrating for not win, but at the same time I'm happy. 
I was second starting the day and I finished second, so it's not that ‑‑ I mean, I didn't do anything atrocious.
