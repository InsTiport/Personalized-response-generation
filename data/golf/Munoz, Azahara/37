 Q.  Great round, obviously disappointment on the eighth hole but all in all what do you take from the round?  AZAHARA MUNOZ: I played really well.  I didn't get myself in trouble.  Hit lots of fairways.  I think I hit every fairway and every green until the back nine. So I gave myself a lot of good chances.  And a couple times I missed the green and made really nice up-and-downs.  On the 17th, it was just a really silly double.  But those happen and hopefully it will be the last one of the week.   Q.  Could you walk us through what did happen?  AZAHARA MUNOZ: I hit a perfect 3-wood.  Then I hit a really good 5-iron but I just missed the green on the left and it bounced and the ball was against the collar.  So I kind of chunked my chip and then 3-putted it.  Really silly.   Q.  For the whole round, you have to feel good about going into tomorrow?  AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball really good.  I'm starting to roll the ball really nicely.  I gave myself so many chances and so many of them could have gone in but they didn't.  Three more days and I like the way I'm playing, so I'm happy.
