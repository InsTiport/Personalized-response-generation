   AZAHARA MUNOZ: Today again I start hitting really good shots and making putts. Yesterday I probably played the same but I didn't get anything dropping. 
 Today I got some putts in, and that was the difference.

 Q. You're only two shots right now out of the lead. How do you feel going into tomorrow?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: I feel good. Of course I'll be nervous or whatever, but this is the spot I want to be in. This is what I practice for. I'm ready for tomorrow.

 Q. Do you have a winning score in your mind for tomorrow?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: No, I haven't thought about it, but I guess like probably gonna be 17 or 18 under. 

 Q. You had couple bogeys and then you bounced back. 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah.

 Q. Just bad shots?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Well, and the first bogey I had I missed my driver to the bunker, to the right bunker from the fairway, and then I hit a little 5 from there. So that was normal bogey. 
 And then the next one was so stupid, because I had to hit it really close to a tree. My caddie told me just go for the pin, but I wanted to go a little right of there. So I don't know, I play with the tree and I hit the tree. So bogey. 
 I actually hit a good shot, but I had to hit it really close. It was stupid. 

 Q. Felt good about the way you are closed, though?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: I did. I made really like important putts today, so I'm happy with that.
