 Q.   Hard fought match.   Tell me about your thoughts on who you were playing today.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Don't really know what to say.   I made a couple of mistakes on the front nine and I lost the third, which I should have won it.   And that was pretty big.   
And then on five, I hit a really good shot and I went over and from there it was impossible.   And I lost the hole.   But after that, I played a little bit better, but it was kind of a little bit too late, because she played really good at the end.   She putted really well all day, she made every putt she had.   So it was really tough to get holes back.   But she played great, so all I can say is congratulations to her.  
   
 Q.   Have you been watching the leaderboard as you've been going along?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, at the beginning it was looking pretty bad.   I was looking at it.   So I'm just going to go out there and support my teammates now.   
   
 Q.   What would it mean for you guys if you could pull this off and win on U.S. soil for the first time?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I'm going to cry now.   
It would mean everything.   We have never won here, and it's really tough with the crowd, and I just want to do this for Lotta and my teammates.   And I'm really upset that I lost because I really wanted to get my point for Europe.   But there are few matches out there, and I'm just going to go out there and support them.
