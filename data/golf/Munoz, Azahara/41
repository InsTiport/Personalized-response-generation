Q.   We're here with Azahara MuÃ±oz.   Great opening round 66.   What was working for you out there today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think everything was working.   I think I hit my driver extremely well, I think I hit 14 out of 14 fairways.   I'm pretty long, so that put me in very good situations, and I hit many, many good shots, too, into the greens.   On the front nine my putter was pretty hot, so I got to make quite a few nice putts and get it rolling.

Q.   How do you feel about course conditions?   Greens rolling pretty good, and was it pretty soft out there?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, it was really soft.   It was nice because you could really fire at the pins even with long irons into these pins, and the course is perfect.   The greens are super nice.   They roll really good, and the fairways, too, so it's a great golf course.

Q.   You had a couple good playing partners out there today, too, in Lydia and Lexi.   You all played pretty well, though.   Did you guys play off each other at all today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think so.   It's always nice when you play with people that you like, especially when everybody is playing well because everybody is in a good mood, and that gets things going, too.   I think I've played with Lexi about every single tournament this year, but it's only my second time with Lydia, and she's just so sweet, so I love playing with her.

Q.   You've been playing pretty well lately.   How would you describe the overall state of your game?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I'm playing really well.   I'm finally hitting my driver really well and my irons really well.   Normally my long game is pretty good, and I was struggling the last couple months a little bit with that, so now it's back, I think, it's back, and as long as I made a few putts out there, it's always going to be a good round.

Q.   You expect low scores the rest of the way here?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think so.   Maybe not as low as today, but I think it's going to be a low one, this one.
