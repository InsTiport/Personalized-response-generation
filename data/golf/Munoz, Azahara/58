 Q.   First win on U.S. soil for the Europeans.   How does it feel?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It feels amazing.   We all knew we could do it, but one thing is thinking that you can, and another thing is to win it.   And it is just amazing.   
Obviously, it's really tough to win here with the crowds and everything, that's why it's never been done, but we have got it, we are so happy to be able to do it.   
   
 Q.   What was the biggest motivation for your team?   Was it keeping the cup, beating the U.S. in the U.S.?   Something else?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think it was everything.   We wanted to keep the cup.   We wanted to win on U.S. soil since we never won it.   But I think the most important thing is we all wanted to win for Lotta.   I mean, Meg is amazing, but for us, Lotta is too.   She's so nice to be around, she's made us feel so comfortable.   So she really, really deserved it, and we were all talking about it and we wanted to do it for her.  
   
 Q.   Having three Spaniards on the team, all of whom played pretty well.   How does that feel for you?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It's amazing.   I mean they have been showing this live on the Golf Channel in Spain, and a lot of people have been watching it.   And hopefully it's going to improve women's golf in Spain.   And it's just nice to have the whole country supporting us.
