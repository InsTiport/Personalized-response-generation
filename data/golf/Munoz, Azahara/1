  Q. Aza, nice 2-under 70 bogey-free round.  Great way to start the tournament.  How are you feeling right now?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, it was really good today.  Was a really tricky day.  The wind swirls a lot around this golf course so it's hard to commit sometimes, but I think we pick all the right shots and we never got ourselves in trouble, so it was just a stress-free round.
 Q. How is dealing with the weather, the overcast skies, the rain that came in there at the very end?  It's got to be a little frustrating I would think.
 AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You know, it is what it is.  At least -- actually my caddie this morning said, Well, if we only get rained on the last it's all right.  So when we were coming down the last I was like, Why didn't saw when we were having lunch?
 So at least we got lucky that it was only on the last, but it's pretty chilly out there again, and with the wind it's just really tough today.
 Q. What's the takeaway from today that you look to for tomorrow?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Just keep doing what we been doing.  Try to pick the smart places.  You know want to be on right spots on these greens and things like that, so just hopefully it keep doing that.
 Q. Off Kia topic, but it was just announced for the Solheim Cup in Spain that the queen is going to be ambassador for the event.  That's got to be pretty cool to get that kind of recognition.
 AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It's amazing.  When I saw it actually had no idea, so like I found out I guess how you guys found out.  It's amazing to have the king and the queen behind a tournament that obviously is so important to us but now it's going to be very important to everybody.
 And I know the government, the tourism ambassador and all those people have been really saying it's going to be one of the main events, so I'm very proud that my city, I guess, you know, is so supportive of women's golf.
