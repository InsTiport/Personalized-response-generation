Q. Right in the fray after two rounds on a difficult golf course.  Sum up how you played for two days.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I played really well, especially with my start this morning.  I started with three bogeys in a row, but I'm super proud of myself because I kept calm and I just knew I'm playing well and I could make birdies.  Thankfully, I did.
2 under after two rounds in a U.S. Open is always really good.  So I'm excited about it and looking forward to the weekend.
Q. How do you keep it together after a start like that?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: That's a good question.  I don't know.  Sometimes, it's easier than others.  Today was actually fairly easy, to be honest.  I don't even know why.  I've been working on it a little bit.  My attitude wasn't the best the last few years, and this year it has, and it makes a huge difference.  So I know that the calmer I am, the better I'm going to play.
So, you know, there is no point on getting upset because it's just not going to help at all.
Q. Did you get to that point through some mental side coaching or just stuff you figured out on your own?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: A few YouTube videos and on my own, yeah.
Q. What kind of YouTube videos do you watch for that?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Not going to give away -- no, I don't know.  I like to read a lot of things, and I don't know, talking to my coaches.  I was just kidding, but I don't have a mental coach, but my coaches helped me a lot with it as well.
