Q.   After two rounds, to score 9‑under par, but it's got to be very difficult after shooting such a tremendous 65 in the opening round, comparing that score to today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   No, I didn't, because I knew it was really hard‑‑ I'm hitting really good shots but just not making as many putts as I did yesterday.   I made a bogey on 3, just went too far on the fairway.   But other than that I played really well, so I'm really excited for the weekend.

Q.   You talked about the putts today, it seems so important to be on the right segment of the greens to give yourself a good chance?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It is.   I had a lot of downhillers today.   I kept thinking that they were faster than they were.   I kept missing them short.

Q.   After a really demanding tee shot‑‑
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, I wasn't sure if the 8 could make it but I thought it did.   Thankfully I hit a really good third shot and I just made a bogey.   But at least I only made a bogey. 

Q.   Well, you recovered well after that and a round of 70, so two shots behind Stacy going into the final round.   Do you go out and hit balls after this?   It's about 130 degrees out here. 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think I'm going to go hit a few putts and maybe five or ten balls, but no more than that. 

Q.   You're used to this weather coming from Spain. 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I'm not, this is too hot for me. 

Q.   This is a terrific week on the LPGA schedule. 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, we all love coming here.   Singapore is one of our favourite cities, and HSBC does a tremendous job, so we are all really thankful to be here. 

Q.   There's so many great Spaniards on Tour at the moment, where does this all come from? 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You seem surprised.   There are quite a few of us and I think a lot of us coming on this year and there will be even more next year.   So it's a good season for us.
