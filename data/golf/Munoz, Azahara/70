 Q.   So 1‑over par today.   You toughed it out and you're still in the hunt.   Just talk about your day and how you think you played.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You know what?   I think I played much better than the result.   I didn't make birdie on 1, and then the wind was really hurting from the left on 2 and 3, and I aimed way left and it didn't come back, so I went into the bunker and hit it flat both times.   
So I made bogeys on there.   And then on 5 I was hitting a 4‑iron into the green, and I was stupid.   I should've just played right of the green, and I just tried to get too cute, hit it in the water, and save a really nice par.   
I played much better after that.   On 9 I hit a really bad putt; on 10 I hit a really good putt, but I didn't think it was going to break and I lipped out.   
You know, after that I kept like I have playing like I was, and I made really nice birdies on‑‑ 16 I made bogey.   We couldn't figure out the wind, and I went like 30 yards over the pin.   So I made bogey.  
But other than that, I played really well.   
   
 Q.   Did you draw on anything today, maybe the Solheim Cup or your win in Madrid?   Anything being in the final group that you think about?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   No, you know, I was just trying to‑‑ I haven't been nervous all day, and I think actually at the beginning I was a little too calm.   Sometimes it's nice to be a little nervous.  
But playing with AI is so nice, so it was just like yesterday and the day before.  
   
 Q.   Talk about Ai, playing with her, so rhythmic and so slow.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It's awesome, because between shots we talk.   She's always smiling.   Obviously now she's playing good.   But even I played with her once at Grand Cypress, and I think she shot 5‑over and she was that nice.   Like it doesn't matter what she's shooting.  
You know, I got a lot to learn from that.   I'm happy I'm getting to see that, because that's what I'm working on.   I like it.  
   
 Q.   Last one.   Looking forward to tomorrow, some thoughts on probably playing in the final group again.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I'm three behind, right?   
   
 Q.   Yeah, tied for second.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, with Cristie right?  
   
 Q.   Yeah, so probably you, Cristie, and Ai.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah.   You know, hopefully I shoot lower than today.   But, yeah, just trying to keep calm and just try to smile a little more.   Hopefully I don't make so many stupid mistakes.   Just going to try to enjoy it.
