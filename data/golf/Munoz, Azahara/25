Q. You were bogey-free today.  What was working well for you?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Everything, really.  Hit my driver really well.  Only missed one fairway.  Actually my irons were really good.  It's kind of hard to judge with the wind, so I missed a couple -- a few greens, but hitting good shots, anyways.  Then when I didn't, I made really nice up-and-downs.
I would say I putted pretty solid.  Every putt that I hit, if it didn't go in, it was barely.
Q. You had a good finish here last year.  What is it you like about this course?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I don't know.  It is true.  I don't know what it is.  I think it's because the greens are so big but they are -- it's like little sections on every green, and I like that you really have to focus on small targets.
Q. Anything you're going to do different for tomorrow?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: No, hopefully every day from now on is the same.  No complaints.
