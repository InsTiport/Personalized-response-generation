 Q. So today it was a hard match? Lots of up-and-down?
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, they made too many birdies and we didn't quite answer at the end, so that was the key.

 Q. How do you look forward to it tomorrow for the singles? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Well, they have 12 points left, so I hope we can get as many as we can. Whoever wins tomorrow, will win the cup.

 Q. Do you think your team is strong enough? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think so. (Indiscernible).
 We are tied now at 8-8, so it is what it is.
