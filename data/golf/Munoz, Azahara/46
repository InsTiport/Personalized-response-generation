Q.   Many congratulations on a very dominant performance today.   After yesterday, being beaten by the American team, how did you turn it around?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   We just talked of the things we didn't do quite right yesterday.   We lost the 7th hole yesterday and we kind of got down on ourselves and that's not how normally we are.   We normally are very cheerful.   We learned from it and we said from the beginning, Let's just give it our best.   No matter if we're down or whatever, just keep heads high and that's what we did today.   We played really well and made lots of birdies. 
As partners, we played really, really well.   So that was really fun to be out there.

Q.   I noticed on the 11th green you guys had a bit of a head‑to‑head with your caddies and looked at the scoreboard.   What did you look for and what were you trying to figure out from that? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   We want to play tomorrow, so we were looking at our teammates, what they were doing.   We just wanted them to win and let's see if they can play good and we can play tomorrow, because we really want to play match play tomorrow. 

Q.   Is it going to be weird maybe having to root for America to win their matches?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   No, we're going to root for whoever we have to root for.   So we want to get through.   So whatever has to happen, it's good.
