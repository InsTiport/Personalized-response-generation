Q. Pretty decent first rounds to start with.  What was working well for you out there.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I guess everything.  I hit my driver really well so never got myself in trouble.  Hit a few really good irons to within 15 feet, quite a lot them 10, 15 feet, and I make the putts.  I played really, really well the par-5s.
Q. Do you think is there a particular key to if course?  Do you have to do a certain thing well to play well here?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Well, I think definitely obviously be in play, but you definitely have to hit your irons well because the greens are quite tricky.
Even hitting good shots sometimes you might be 30 feet away because they're so firm and they move a lot.  So I would say definitely the irons.
Q. How have you felt your year as a whole, and what would it mean to finish well here?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, so obviously the year hasn't gone quite as well as I wanted it.  Winning in Spain was pretty important to me.  I know it's not an LPGA event, but it was my hometown and it meant a lot.  That changed things a little bit.
I want to finish strong and finish the year on a good note because it hasn't been quite what I would have liked.
