 Q.   Talk about coming back on that back nine and still sticking with it, you never gave up, which was awesome to see, but talk about that back nine.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Well, obviously I'm playing really well.   Today I started bogey, bogey so that got me really behind and then I made a couple really nice birdies and gave myself a lot of chances.   Didn't quite make enough putts today but made really nice putts on the back nine for par, too, and that kept me going and at the end made a couple really nice birdies.  
   
 Q.   After the bogey, bogey start, what was going through your head?   Obviously you did not let it deter you?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   No, I didn't, because I'm playing really well, and on 1 I just hit it a little left and it run‑off green but I actually hit a good shot and on 2 it plugged in the bunker.   I knew I was playing good and if I just kept doing my thing, I would make some birdies.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel to be in that type of situation and back in a playoff and get the adrenaline going?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It was exciting.   For starters I didn't think I was going to give myself the chance to be in the playoff, so just being there, I was really happy to be in contention again, and you know, it's always fun.   
   
 Q.   And for her to finish on that putt, you can't feel too‑‑  
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   No, that putt, it's pretty much impossible to putt it and to hold it, so nothing you can do about, just congratulate her.  
   
 Q.   You have to be taking a lot away from this week, and you played solid.   What are you going to take away most from your play?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You know, I know what I've been working on is working, so just keep doing the same thing.   Obviously gives me a lot of confidence and hopefully I keep playing like this.
