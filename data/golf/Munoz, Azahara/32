 Q. Take me through the events you've been to. I know you went and saw Rafa. Take me through that and how it's been so far staying in the village?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, so I got here Thursday night, and then on Friday we went to see Rafa play singles. Then I watched the other guy, Roberto Bautista, play singles, as well.   
Rafa's games was amazing, and then he came back like I always does and it was quite incredible. He was playing against a Brazilian, and so the atmosphere was pretty amazing. Him and another Spanish guy, Mark Lopez, they played doubles for the gold, and same thing, the match went on three sets, and it was incredible, 7‑5 on the last.   
It was cool to see them getting the Gold Medals on the podium and the anthem. I've seen it on TV but never in person like that, and it was insane.   
On Saturday, we went to see basketball, Spain versus Lithuania. That was really good. That was it. Carlota's brother went to the handball, but it was a little late and we didn't quite have time. We might go to basketball again tonight, playing against Argentina.   
Everything is amazing. The village is incredible, walking among other athletes and going to the gym and everybody is working out. This morning, I came early and I left the apartment at 7.00 and you think you are really early. But everybody is already out. It's incredible. Everybody is running. It's really cool.   
And the runners run around‑‑ because there is a track around the village, so they train there. So you walk and they are like running everywhere. It's just so different. You go to the dining and so many athletes. And it's really cool, because like I know who the Spaniards are because of the uniforms, too, so no matter who they are, even if you don't know them, you always say hello. It's such a cool experience.  
   
 Q. What surprises you about the village?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ: How big it is. You always think it has to be big because there is 10,000 athletes or whatever, but it's incredible, how many buildings. It takes forever to go from the apartments to the workout. I could literally run and that would be my warm up. It's super far. I think how big it is.   
   
 Q. Have you seen anybody else that either surprised you or you saw and wanted to take a picture?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I have taken a picture with a few of the Spanish people. But I've wanted to take a picture with a lot of people but I always‑‑ I don't want to bother them. But we saw Michael Phelps a lot.   
We saw Usain Bolt going by. That really impressed me. I know he's big and you see on TV how big he is, but he is massive. So I don't know, it's just something different that we've never experienced, and I'm really happy we got the opportunity.   
   
 Q. Initial thoughts on the course?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah, I played today. It's pretty good. I mean, the course is amazing. It's playing pretty tough right now because we are playing all the way from the back, so it's as long as it's going to be. But it's also not blowing. So once it starts blowing, it's pretty tough. But it's such a good track. I think if you hit good shots, you get rewarded.  
   
 Q. Did you guys talk to Sergio and Rafa?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ: We did. I don't like to ask so many questions, especially to the guys, because they hit it so much farther. We did, and they said, you know, the 10th, 11, 13 is a really tough stretch and then it gets easier, a few things like that, but not super specific because for everybody the course is different.  
   
 Q. Did you watch the final yesterday? Did you see the podium at all?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I didn't, because then I went to play, but we heard it and it was amazing. It was one of those that you're like, man, I really want to be up here.  
   
 Q. Being here with Carlota has to be awesome, Team Spain, the atmosphere, how has that been?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ: So far, it's been so cool. Ever since golf became part of the Olympic Games, we said it, we want to be there together and we did it. So it's such an honour to be representing Spain and be with Carlota here.
