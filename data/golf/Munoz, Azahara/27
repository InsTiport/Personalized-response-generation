Q. 3-under today, but let's start with the hole-in-one on No. 3.  What number is that for you?  What was the club you hit?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: It was 120.  120 front, 128 to the pin, and the wind was hurting a little bit, so I hit an 8-iron it was actually my first hole-in-one as a pro -- well, as anything in competition -- so I was pretty excited.
I actually hit a really good shot.  Sometimes people say, I hit it thin or whatever.  No, I hit it really good.  Bounce about that far right of the pin, went forward, and spun back in.
Q. So the first one in competition.  How many when you've just been playing around in practice rounds?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: This is my sixth, but five just at home playing.  Those don't count.
Q. And then I saw you just gave the ball to a little fan.  What was that experience like?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Well, my caddie was actually telling me that I should keep it.  I'm like, No, I'll give it away to a little girl.  You never know.  She could be out here with us in a few years.
Q. Overall on the day, 3-under; pretty sold round to get started here at the Kia Classic.
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Yeah.  I played really well.  Hit lots of fairways, greens, hit plenty of good putts.  It's nice to get out there early in the morning with fresh greens.
I'm just really happy.
Q. What's the game plan for the rest of the day?  Any celebrations in order for the ace?
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think I'm going to have to buy dinner for Sarah and Dwayne.  Maybe a couple of the caddies.  Shane and Simon probably want to join as well.  So, yeah.
