Q. What a day for you out there, being able to rebound as you did throughout the round.  How are you feeling coming off the course today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I'm proud of myself.  Obviously it was a tough day and I didn't have a good start.  I got pretty unlucky on No. 6.  I got a plugged lie in the bunker, so I had to take an unplayable.  But I fought really hard.  I made some really nice putts coming in and all you can do.
Q. What was it like for you to be in contention and into the playoff?  What were your feelings when you found out you were going to be going extra holes?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It's really fun.  I think that's what we practice for.  We just want to be in contention and feel the nerves.  So it was really, really good to be there.
Q. How were you feeling as you were going off this front nine heading into the back nine?  What were you telling yourself to rebound and continue to stay strong?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Just keep doing what you're doing.  I know I'm playing good enough, so I knew I could make birdies coming in, and you never know what can happen in these type of courses, so the same thing; I made a double like that, someone else could do it, too.  Just the only thing I wanted to do was fight until the end and that's what I did.
Q. How are you feeling about your game about what you were able to do here today?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Feeling really good.  It's always great to have a good week before a major, but it's a new week, so tomorrow I'll take the day off and Tuesday will be a new day.
