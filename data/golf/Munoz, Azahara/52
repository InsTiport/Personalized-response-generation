Q.   We're here with Azahara Munoz after the second round today.   Can you take us through your round a little bit, explain especially what happened out there on the back nine? 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, I played really well all day.   I hit lots of fairways and hit it pretty close, made a couple nice putts.   I got to be 4‑under and then made a couple silly mistakes, but overall I'm 2‑under and really excited for the weekend.

Q.   I know you mentioned silly mistakes.   Can you go into specifics on those?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Yeah, well, on 16, my 16, which was 7, I was kind of in between clubs and I went for the 8 instead of a little 7 and the wind was kind of hurting a little bit.   I actually hit a really good shot, but it didn't quite get there.   Probably three more feet it would have been perfect, but it just came back in the bunker.
And then on 8, I just hit a bad iron and then overread the putt, and same thing on here, I hit a really good putt, I just overread it a little bit.

Q.   Weather conditions today, any factor, or do you expect wind when you come out here?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   You kind of get both things, but obviously today was so perfect.   Both days actually, yesterday afternoon was a little windy but nothing really.   So far it's been perfect for us.

Q.   What's a successful day for you tomorrow? 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I don't know, I don't want to give myself a number, I just want to keep giving myself chances and hopefully make a few more putts.
