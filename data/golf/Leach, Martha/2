(Recording in progress.)
MARTHA LEACH: Pretty spectacular, to be honest.  I'm like, Wow, what a time to do it.
Q. It's fabulous.
MARTHA LEACH: It is.  It's kind of nerving in a way.  So like what do you expect next?  So I hit a lot of good shots coming in but didn't putt as well.  Had another 3-putt on 17.  I spoke with the head golf professional here about the greens and he said he's been here 12 years and he still shakes his head.
I told myself I'm here for one week, I'm just going to commit to what I see and just go with it and be nicer to myself.
Q. It's funny.  They were talking the same thing at the Broadmoor for the Senior Open.  Just all these breaks that you don't see.
MARTHA LEACH: You don't see.  Why stress yourself?  I just said, I'm not doing this for a living.
Q. Right.  So 17, 18 are you just trying to get it to the house a little bit?
MARTHA LEACH: I'm getting in the house, but I knew they're birdie holes.  I know 18 is, and 18 I had 185 to the hole and just (indiscernible) hybrid.  I mean, I hit it solid.  It was probably one of my more free-ish swings and not kind of steering it all over the place.
I just blocked it right and then I hit a -- the chip wasn't easy.  The grass was matted down there and I just hit it a little too soft.  I made my putt, so it all works out.
Q. Yeah, I know you had a little one...
MARTHA LEACH: Yeah.
Q. Okay.  At least I made par.
MARTHA LEACH: Right, right.
Q. Because if you had made a bogey that would be been really...
MARTHA LEACH: Would've been a downer.  Would've been a downer.
Q. Yeah.  So I heard somebody say that you kicked their butt.
MARTHA LEACH: Who?  Hollis?  You know what?  I'm pulling for Hollis.  I'm like, God I hope she's playing well, and she's probably saying the same thing about me.
Q. Of course.
MARTHA LEACH: And, you know, like she did say it, You kicked my butt, but I hope she kicks my butt, too.
Q. Yeah.  And just low amateur, I know that would be very important to you.
MARTHA LEACH: Well, that's the only goal I have.  There are a lot of amateurs that are good.  Patty is playing well.  All I can do -- and this golf course, one hole can just change it all for everyone.
I'm just going to go out, figure out what I'm doing, try to hit it a little bit better.  I'm not hitting it great, but I think golf is more interesting when you're not hitting it well and you're trying to get it in the hole.  Just kind of fake it until you make it.
That's what I've been doing, so it's all good.
Q. And that becomes much more mental then, right, about what you're trying to accomplish?
MARTHA LEACH: It is.  I know I'm not swinging great, but what am I going to do about it?
Q. Maybe tomorrow you'll wake you know in the zone.
MARTHA LEACH: Well, you never know.
Q. Do you have the ball that you made the eagle with?
MARTHA LEACH: Yeah.
Q. Would you be willing to give it to the museum?
MARTHA LEACH: But I have all these signatures on it already.
Q. Oh, that's the one you got the signatures on?  No, no, no.  I don't want you to do that.  We're just looking for things from the inaugural championship.
MARTHA LEACH: I get it.
Q. No, no.
MARTHA LEACH: I'm sorry.
Q. Who signed it?
MARTHA LEACH: Players, my daughter, and I had the standard bearer in the (indiscernible - wind.)
Q. Oh, that's sweet.
MARTHA LEACH: So, sorry about that.
Q. No, no, no.  That's fabulous.  That's fabulous.
MARTHA LEACH: I had a hole in one at the North South Amateur and I had everybody sign it that was around.  I just keep that.  I don't keep much.
Q. Those are special things.
MARTHA LEACH: Yeah.
Q. I want you to keep it.
MARTHA LEACH: I would've given it to you if you were quicker.
Q. I know.  I had to be out there right on the 14th green waiting.
MARTHA LEACH: No, I gave it to -- soon as we sat down and scores I did it.  I'm sorry.
Q. No, no.  Congratulations on the eagle.  Good luck tomorrow.
MARTHA LEACH: Thank you.
