 Q.  Talk about your round and how you were feeling out there.  
WILLIAM BUHL: I didn't start great.  I was 3-over after 3, so that was not the start I wanted.  After that it kind of settled down -- I guess I was a little nervous to start, a little antsy here and there, wanted to play faster than I usually do.  So I really just started focusing on lines a lot more and I watched two or three putts outside 12 feet drop, so that's always a plus.  And then hitting it close too.  But overall it was a lot of fairways and greens after those first three holes.   
 Q.  Have you played at Pinehurst much?  
WILLIAM BUHL: It is my first time up here.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts today of No. 4?  
WILLIAM BUHL: No. 4 fits my eye a little better than No. 2 does.  But both good golf course, they're both a brutal test of golf.  It's fair but it's hard.   
 Q.  Do you think coming off a win at the Canadian Am has given you an edge, that's maybe why you're up there near the top of the leaderboard today?  
WILLIAM BUHL: Yeah, absolutely, I've been playing good now for three or four weeks, so to keep it -- I had the opportunity last week and then got in here with the exemption -- and to be able to keep that rolling is, feels really good.   
 Q.  What's it going to take tomorrow on No. 2 to keep up the good play, keep it going?  
WILLIAM BUHL: No. 2, if I had to say, it would probably play two to three shots harder that be No. 4.  I think even par goes a long way out there depending upon the weather, obviously, but even par to 1-over is a really, really good score out there.
