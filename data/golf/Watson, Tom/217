  Q.  Talk about your round.   

 TOM WATSON:  It was all defense today.  I let them kick a field goal and let them run all the way back for a touchdown.   

 You have to play defense on this golf course.   

 You have to hit a lot of quality shots.   

 Not a good way to end the Masters.  It was very disappointing.  I only hit four greens and was playing defense.  These greens are the toughest I've seen them.  They are not unfair.  I can't hold it on 17.  It will favor a veteran person.   
  
  Q.  About Watabu.   

 TOM WATSON:  It's always fun to play with a first timer.  I remember playing with Doug Ford for my first time.
