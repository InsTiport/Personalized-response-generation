 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
TOM WATSON:   Well, yeah.   Shooting under par and having a chance to make the cut, that was the high.   
The low was today with the way I played.   I just didn't perform today.   I didn't drive the ball like I did yesterday, I didn't putt like I did yesterday.   
Who knows.   I mean, it's like a thermos.   Some days it's hot, some days it's cold.
