Q.   First of all, was the back nine today maybe a little bit more of a struggle than the first nine?
TOM WATSON:   Yeah, I played a really good front nine.   I didn't come away with very much as far as my putting's concerned.   I had the a lot of good shots, good iron shots and then the back nine, heck, I, it was complete reversal.   I didn't hit very many good shots and I struggled for a 2‑over par on the back nine. 
I have moments of greatness and there was moments of kind of mediocrity out there for me today.   So maybe I can put all the moments in good order tomorrow.

Q.   Do you feel like you still have the game that you can make a nice run on Sunday to get back in this?
TOM WATSON:   Yeah, I'm going to have to make some putts.   My iron game is good right now, that's the most important thing, because I can get the ball ‑‑ I think I can get the ball close to the hole.   When your iron game is on, on this golf course, you can at least have a look at a birdie. 
If your iron game's not on, you don't get very many looks, you're trying to 2‑putt from 40 feet.

Q.   The putt on 15, did you think it was going to drop?
TOM WATSON:   Well for a minute there, yeah.   I had it going right‑to‑left, just outside left edge, and it broke a little bit to the right and I said, okay, keep breaking, and it just straightened out. 
The one at 18, I made a good putt at 18, it was just ‑‑ I hit it maybe a little too hard to take the break.   But I was happy with those two putts.   I made a little adjustment with my putting stroke and maybe that's what I need tomorrow to make some putts. 

Q.   After the putt on 17 or rather 16, you said, "Come on."   Was that kind of a frustration?
TOM WATSON:   Yeah, I mad a bad stroke there at 16.   But I made a good stroke at 18 and a good stroke at 15.
