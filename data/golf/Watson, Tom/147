 Q. You played really well today. What was working out there for you?
 TOM WATSON: Well I made some long putts today. I didn't hurt myself too badly, although I challenged the water on both 16 and 17 and came away with 1-over par on those two holes. So I was pretty lucky there. But I made two long putts and hit the ball pretty well and a little bit better today than I did yesterday, so I can't complain. 

 Q. When you step away from this week what are you going to remember? Were there one or two things that you think may have cost you from having a chance at this thing?
 TOM WATSON: Well, yeah, I could go back and make excuses, but I just didn't play well enough. I drove the ball very well and that was not the issue. My iron play wasn't very accurate. I wasn't very good with the distance on my irons and my putting was pretty poor. I made a couple long putts today, but that makes up for some of the putts I missed, but it didn't make up enough.

 Q. You spent four days around this course now, good test for championship golf? Did you like it out there?
 TOM WATSON: Oh, sure. Yeah, it's a wonderful test of golf. It requires every club in your bag and it's a lot of fun to play this golf course. 

 Q. Do you think a Ryder Cup, a PGA Championship could be played on this course?
 TOM WATSON: I don't know. It's brand new.
