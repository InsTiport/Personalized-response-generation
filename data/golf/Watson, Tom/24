 Q.  So how do you feel the course played today?  Was it pretty well?  
TOM WATSON: Well, I thought the course was pretty forgiving today.  We had a nice wind from the southwest, which made it -- you know, had some challenging shots in there.  But overall, the course is in really good shape.  I think the greens are pretty receptive.  They weren't too hard.   
It plays like a U.S. Open course.  I mean, if you hit it off the fairway, you're struggling.  And around the greens, it's really tough.  If you just miss the greens, the rough around the greens is very hard to judge, get the the ball close.   
 Q.  You had a couple back-to-back birdies.  I think it was 15 and 16.  What was it?  Did you just kind of start playing better?  
TOM WATSON: Well, I made a long putt at 15.  I made it from about 30 feet.  And, actually, I read the putt right and the ball went in the hole.  Finally I hit a good putt.  And I hit two good shots at 16 and knocked in about an eight-footer or six-footer, something like that, for a birdie there.   
Birdies were hard to get out there for me today.  I three-putted twice and missed another short putt, so my putting wasn't very good.  But made up for it on the back nine with the long 30-footer and a birdie at 16.  So I'm pretty happy with a 72.   
 Q.  Thanks, Tom.  We look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  
TOM WATSON: Thank you.
