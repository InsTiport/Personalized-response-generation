 Q. (Recording in progress.) 
 TOM WATSON: It is. I'm a pro emeritus here after Sam Snead for so many years here. I love this place. Has a great down home atmosphere to it. It's got everything you want as far as entertainment is concerned. Just wonderful service. The people treat you just great here. 
 That's why I loved it right from the beginning, and I keep coming back.

 Q. Just kind of a roller coaster out there today. 
 TOM WATSON: My game today was a little bit spotty. My putter especially was not very good. That's the way it goes sometimes. Didn't feel like I putted all that badly, but nothing went in.

 Q. How do you like the renovation?
 TOM WATSON: Well the golf course is -- you know, didn't make a birdie today, and that's the first time for that to happen in a long time. Doesn't sit very well with me. Make a few more birdies tomorrow. 
 I see some red numbers up there with 5-under and 6-under, so birdies can be made out there. I just didn't make any today. Tomorrow is a different story.
