 Q.   144 strokes for the first two rounds, are you pleased with your play?  
TOM WATSON:   Well, not really.   A couple of good places, I had a good shot at 4 and 8‑‑ other than that, I didn't drive the ball in the fairway today.   It was a tough day for me to put the ball in the fairway today.   
   
 Q.   Can you give us a sense of how different the conditions were from yesterday to today and how difficult it was to play?   
TOM WATSON:   Well, if you hit a whole bank of fans out there in the ocean right there and it's coming in 20 miles an hour‑‑ that was the difference between today and yesterday.   
It was a good day.   I didn't manage myself very well today, but that's what links golf does for you today.   
   
 Q.   You said you were searching for something in your game over the last few days and at Lytham it wasn't quite right.   Are you any closer to finding it?   
TOM WATSON:   It's still an enigma.   
   
 Q.   And the putter?   
TOM WATSON:   The putter, I had some good strokes on the last couple of holes.   I was happy with the way I was stroking the ball on the last couple of holes.   You do have to make some adjustments and I did that today on the last couple of holes.
