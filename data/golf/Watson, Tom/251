TOM WATSON:  I drove it poorly three or four times today and it cost me.  I deserved what I shot. I did hit a lot of good shots but I didnât drive it well on the back nine. I had started the day hitting the ball pretty well.


I didnât handle the crosswinds today. This course is quite a test and today was quite an examination. I donât think too many under par is going to win.


75 is not all that bad today. If three or four of those drives were better, it might have been a different story.
