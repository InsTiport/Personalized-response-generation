Q. It was a bit of a rough day yesterday but you really came back like a champion today.  Were you looking at the scoreboards and the cut line and just trying to be around for the weekend?
TOM WATSON: Well, I was really just trying to make the cut honestly.  The whole day was just trying to stay in there.  I thought the cut was going to be higher, but the wind died and came from a different angle, so the course played easier.  So the scores got lower today.
Q. You had great support out there.  How important is it to have the support of the people over here when you're out there playing?
TOM WATSON: Well, I'm really impressed with the number of people that are out here.  I'm glad that the senior events get this type of fan support.  This is really good.  Just the first hole, all the way down the first hole, for our group today, we had just great support all day.  It was fun to play in front of a bunch of people.
