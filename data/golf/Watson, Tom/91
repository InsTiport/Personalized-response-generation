Q.   Can you just talk about your round today. 
TOM WATSON:   My round was, I shot 72.   I left some shots out there.   I hit a bad drive at ‑‑ didn't drive the ball well today, compared to what I did yesterday.   And it put me in the rough a few times and I didn't get the ball up‑and‑down very well today and I didn't make very many putts today.   So today was just, it was a dull day on the golf course.   It wasn't very exciting. 

Q.   Did the weather delay affect things at all?
TOM WATSON:   No.   No.   I was in good shape.   My body didn't stiffen up or anything like that.   At our age that's what you worry about, whether your body's going to react after sitting down for a couple hours, if it's going to react differently.

Q.   And how do you feel the course held up after the rain?
TOM WATSON:   Well, I thought it was pretty for giving, really.   I thought that the scores reflected it and they're going to shoot some ‑‑ they shot some good scores out there today.   And that, the golf course has given up some. 

Q.   Your thoughts heading into the final round tomorrow?
TOM WATSON:   Well, I better shoot in the mid 60s to have any sort of chance at all.   I hit some pretty good shots, I can't complain, but the putter didn't react very well ‑‑ first day I made everything, so maybe I'm just averaging everything out right now.
