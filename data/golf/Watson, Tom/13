 Q.  First round, no dropped shots, you must be satisfied?  
TOM WATSON: One of the things I haven't done for about 20 years is have a scorecard with no fives on it, and I didn't have a single five on it today.  I was very pleased with that.  I had opportunities to make a couple of fives but my long putts were good today and I hit a number of good quality shots today.  I was very happy about the way I played.   
 Q.  How tough was it coming in on the back nine?  
TOM WATSON: Well, it plays long for old folks.  I'm back there hitting 3-wood to 13 and hybrid to 15.  I'm back there a long way.  At least my touch was good around the greens.  It saved me a couple times.  I was very happy about the chasing 3-iron I hit into 17.  Just you never know what's going to happen there.  I hit it -- that was my favourite shot of the day, to just get up on the upper level.  To me, that's a great accomplishment for me.   
 Q.  Nice to get off to a good start in sunny St. Andrews?  
TOM WATSON: It is.  St. Andrews, you can take advantage of it with the downwind holes.  Into the wind sometimes you get fooled.  It's a wonderful golf course.  You never really feel comfortable playing the golf course.  Just so many humps and bumps and different things and different kind of odd lies that you get that makes it very challenging.
