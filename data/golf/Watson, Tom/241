Q. Talk about the round.
 TOM WATSON:  I played a pretty solid round of golf.  I made a pretty solid run on the back nine, made four birdies and a three putt bogey at 18 and a three putt bogey at 9 were my two bogeys of the day.  So I had a pretty good round of golf.  68 is a good start in this Senior Open championship, and I'm getting more familiar with the golf course day by day.
Q.  Some of the momentum you had from winning last week kind of carried over into this week?
 TOM WATSON:  Well, I played some pretty good golf today.  I hit some quality shots, kept the ball in play for most of the day, and it was a good solid round of golf.  The momentum from last week I think carried over without a doubt.
Q.  How was your driver?
 TOM WATSON:  My driver was very good today.  I missed a couple fairways with it, 9 and 10, but overall I drove it very, very well.
Q.  Did the rain change the playing conditions at all from what you saw in the practice rounds?
 TOM WATSON:  I think the rain was very beneficial for scoring.  The greens were a little bit softer than the USGA would like them, and the scoring reflected that, not a question.
Q.  (Inaudible).
 TOM WATSON:  The speed of the greens was, I think, a little bit slower than what we expected out there.
