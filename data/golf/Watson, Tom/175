  Q. The changes you made yesterday did not --  
 TOM WATSON: No, didn't work very well, obviously. I missed a lot of makeable birdie putts. Just a wasted day of ball-striking. I hit it well. I hit it very well, and absolutely nothing on the greens.   
 Although, I did make a 60-footer and a 30-footer. 5, I made a 30-footer and 60-footer at 13.   
  
  Q. Otherwise, were you missing shorties?   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, I was missing everything. Everything was right. Everything I pushed. Everything pushed. Everything pushed.   
  
  Q. Just one of those days?   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, maybe I ought to aim left. You know, the slicers aim left and hood it. Maybe that's what I ought to do.  
  
  Q. Where has it gone between last week and this week?   
 TOM WATSON: I don't know, I just don't have very good speed control on these greens.   
  
  Q. A lot of people are commenting on how subtle here.   
 TOM WATSON: They are not easy greens but a few putts, it just seemed that they were different speeds to me. Who knows.
