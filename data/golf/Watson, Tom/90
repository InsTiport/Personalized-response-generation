Q.   I know you were 2‑under through 11 and then you probably didn't quite post what you wanted. 
TOM WATSON:   Yeah, I hit some bad shots coming in.   I didn't hit a good shot at the 13th hole, part 3.   And I 3‑putted. 
Then 14, I or 15, I hit a big drive and 16 I hit a bad shot.   And had a couple birdie putts at 17 and 18 and I didn't convert on the greens today. 
So it was a couple of ‑‑ I give myself about a D minus on the greens today is what I give myself.   So first day it was an A.   So it averaged out about a C for the week.

Q.   How did the course play today as opposed to the other days?
TOM WATSON:   It played very receptive.   The greens were holding well.   You see some decent sores out there today.   7‑under par is a pretty darn good score.

Q.   Final thoughts on getting to play in St. Louis and the State of Missouri?
TOM WATSON:   It was fun playing in kind of the home crowd.   I got a lot of nice applause and people who were very kind to me.   I wish I could have shown them some better golf, I'm disappointed about my performance.
