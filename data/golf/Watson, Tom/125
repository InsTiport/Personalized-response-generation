  Q. You started out a little shaky today, but you quickly turned it around and posted another good number.   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, I started out with a 7 on the 10th hole from the middle of the fairway from a hundred yards. Hit it in the bunker, hit it over, bad chip and a bad putt and made 7 right off the bat on a par-5 that you should be making birdie.   
 And that -- and then I knocked it by about six feet on the next hole and made that putt. And then I played some pretty good golf after that.   
 One mistake with the drive on 17 and a mistake with a drive on 7. And I drove the ball pretty well and got it up-and-down at 1 and made a birdie at the tough hole on the 6th hole. Which is the toughest hole on the golf course.   
  
  Q. Without a doubt. Now your position now at minus 4, do you like where you are right now?  
 TOM WATSON: No, I would like to be minus 11.   
 (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. What's your plan for tomorrow?  
 TOM WATSON: Well, don't make anymore 7s.
