Q. Your first criteria for the team, you wanted players with heart.  Talk about what your players just demonstrated in two of those matches.TOM WATSON: They certainly did.  It was not a question, Jimmy Walker getting the ball up-and-down from right over here to there, that showed some guts, and of course Phil Mickelson making birdie to win the match.  It was an ebb and flow match. This whole early morning was pretty much an ebb from the United States' standpoint and then we got some flow.  Fortunately, we're a couple paces ahead right now, but this is a marathon.  Until the last match on Sunday, it will be probably very close.Q. You had faith in rookies sending them out and they rewarded you.TOM WATSON: They did.  I'm so proud of them.  They were very upset with me for not playing them this afternoon.  I said, I know you're going to be mad at me, but you'll be playing tomorrow for sure.Q. Just briefly, give us an insight into your afternoon pairings and how they came about?TOM WATSON: Well, we are starting off with Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar in the first group and then we're playing the second group, Hunter Mahan and Zach Johnson.  I feel both of those players complement each other very well. The third group will be Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler again.  I like the way they finished here.  I think it's important for them to get back out there.  And Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley will bat cleanup, as we say in American baseball, and I'm looking forward to this afternoon and seeing what's happening.  It will be tough playing conditions out there
