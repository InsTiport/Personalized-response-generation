  Q. Good to finish on a high?  
 TOM WATSON: It was good to make a birdie on the last hole, but it was a day of a lot of missed opportunities on the greens. I really hit the ball very well starting out and just came up with nothing on the greens, and I turned a good round into a mediocre round, a 69 today, with poor putting.   
  
  Q. Was that really the key then, just the putting?   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, my putting was not very good. I just didn't -- I had my opportunities to make a lot of birdies today but I just didn't make them.   
  
  Q. Even so, you're still in there, a few shots off the lead, but still a weekend to go.   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, I am a few shots, a lot often lead, the way Freddie is playing. May have to cut off his knee or something (laughing).   
  
  Q. He has not had a bogey.   
 TOM WATSON: Yeah, he's a straight driver of the golf ball and if you do that here, you're going to hit a lot of greens.  
  
  Q. What can you do with your putting overnight between now and tomorrow?  
 TOM WATSON: I think I made an adjustment on my grip on last putt there and that's going to help. I'm just going to try to weaken my grip a little bit so I can feel both hands together a bit more, make myself release it. You know, we've always got to try something.   
  
  Q. What could it have been today if you were putting average?  
 TOM WATSON: If I putted average, it was 67 for sure. Maybe a 66. And if I putted well, it was 64, 63 or 64.   
 Tee-to-green was good. I had my opportunities today.
