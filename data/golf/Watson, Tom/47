 Q.  Captain Watson, obviously not the result you were hoping for but I'm sure you're proud of the effort your players gave?  TOM WATSON: Early in the match, the trending was exactly where we wanted it to go.  We had a lot of red scores up there.  The U.S. players responded early.  They just couldn't keep it going.  That was our problem. But have to give credit to The European Team.  They played better than we did.  They have a wonderful team.  They are stacked with great players, and it would have been a tough go to beat them this week.  But we came in here thinking we could beat them, and just didn't work out.   Q.  The performance of the rookies was tremendous.  TOM WATSON: That's exactly right.  They scored eight and a half points for our team, and that bodes well for the future of the American Ryder Cup Team.   Q.  What's been the highlight of the week for you?  TOM WATSON: Well, the highlight is being able to get to know the players and trying to convince them that they are champions and they can win this event.  I have great vice captains with me and great support alongside of me, and that's what -- I'll take out of this just that; that it was a collective team effort to try to get the players to play their best golf and let them go up on the stage and perform.  The other team performed better than we did, that's the bottom line.   Q.  Fair to say the matches have been played in tremendous spirit, and golf has been the winner, hasn't it?  TOM WATSON: This is a great venue for golf.  Scotland is the Home of Golf, and I think it got us due rewards for this event here.
