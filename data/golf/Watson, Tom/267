  TOM WATSON:  Well, my round today, accentuated with hiccups.  The worst was No. 3 where I hit it in the green side bunker on the par  5 in two and then I fluffed it out, fluffed it and left it in the bunker and knocked it out to about six or eight feet for bogey there.  I'm look thinking birdie and I end up with a bogey, and Craig is in the process of making bogey there, so that hurt me.
