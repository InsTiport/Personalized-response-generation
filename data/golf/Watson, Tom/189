  Q. The number that you thought was out there to get to the top of the leaderboard --  
 TOM WATSON: I thought it would be 60s today with the way the weather was but unfortunately my game was not firing on all cylinders. Even though I felt better today nothing went in. It was kind of a struggle this week in certain instances. It was a real good first round and I had trouble with my iron game the last three rounds.   
 Still, a delightful time being in Scotland for four beautiful days like this. We never get four beautiful days like this.
