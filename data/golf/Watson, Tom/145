 Q. Tom, tough day, but tell me how the conditions were and how the course is playing?
 TOM WATSON: Pebble had its teeth out today. The golf course is firm. But the wind died in the last part of the day. The greens got a little bit bumpy, but Ryo played a very good round of golf. He made a lot of good putts. People can make putts on those greens. I had a lot of unforced errors today, five or six shots that kind of went off the wrong day and I shot 78. 

 Q. How much of a big factor was the wind early on?
 TOM WATSON: The wind is always a factor. We're playing with the same wind as we did in the practice round, it's not any different, maybe just slightly a little bit more from the west today rather from the northwest. But the golf course played just like it did in the practice rounds. Not a whole lot of difference.

 Q. But there were some cheers out there for you. How good did that feel to sort of hear the crowd behind you like that?
 TOM WATSON: I made a birdie at 15 left rough. I put my iron in the left rough, I drew a good line and knocked a 7-iron in about six or seven feet and made the putt, my only birdie today.  But I had a lot of nice cheers out there. It was very special. I'm very grateful for the USGA to grant me an exemption to play here. Tomorrow I'll be playing better golf.
