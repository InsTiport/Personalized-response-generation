 Q.  Thoughts on a 67 today?  
TOM WATSON: Well, I am 67.  I shot 67.  So I shot my age.   
 Q.  Just tell us about the round and how pleased are you with your performance?  
TOM WATSON: Well, I was pretty pleased with it.  I kept the ball in play very well today, and I made some good putts.  I started off well, 2-under in the first three, and saved a good par after a bad iron shot.  Hit two or three really wayward iron shots today.  Got away with them.   
Yesterday I wouldn't have gotten away with those type of shots.  Of course today I was hitting 8-irons rather than 3-woods into these greens.   
It was a pleasure to have a reprieve with the weather.  The last two days, you're betting your head against the wall almost on every hole, just trying to struggle to make par.   
And today, the golf course, she said come and get me today.  You see a lot of players doing that today.   
 Q.  The position you're in, how do you feel about going into tomorrow's round?  
TOM WATSON: Well, I don't know what my position is going to be because there's a lot of golf left to play with the leaders out there.  If they are playing like we did from behind like this, we'll still be pretty far behind.   
 Q.  Do you feel if the weather comes in, you could still get it done this week?  
TOM WATSON: Well, we'll see.  I saw Miguel Ãngel JimÃ©nez, he had a wonderful round today with an unlucky bogey on the last hole.  But there's a 63 out there with no wind out there, that's for sure.  There's some middle 60s being shot today, and I expect a few more will be shot today with the leaders.
