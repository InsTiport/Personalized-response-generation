Q. Your thoughts on the round.  Even par is a good round.
TOM WATSON: Yeah, I had a good round today.  I played well and had a couple of unforced errors.  I got a couple of lucky breaks.  I hit a number of quality shots, which I was very proud of.
Q. The conditions today, a couple of guys saying the greens were a little softer than they've been today.  What did you think of the greens?
TOM WATSON: Well, it's softer early, yeah.  In the afternoon we played yesterday, they had a good moisture content.  They didn't get too hard yesterday afternoon.  I think they're trying to take it easy on us old guys.
Q. Sure.  You played in the worst of the breeze yesterday and today as well.  How was that?  How was the wind?  Did it affect anything?
TOM WATSON: We played with the same breeze as we did yesterday.  This morning it didn't blow hard at all.  So we got out early, and it wasn't blowing hardly at all.  So we played under easy conditions.
Q. 2 over isn't going to be too, too far off the pace.
TOM WATSON: I hope not.
Q. Where do you think you are going into the weekend?
TOM WATSON: I'm happy with 2 over.  I hit some quality shots.  If I can just string those quality shots together and not make the unforced errors that I've been making, it would be good.
