 Q.  What did you think of the conditions out there? 
 TOM WATSON:  The conditions were good breezy conditions.  I like those conditions.  I didn't particularly negotiate it very well on the front side.  I played pretty well on the back side.  But it's a tough golf course.  It is not going to yield a lot of birdies out there because of the wind conditions.  You got to take advantage of the holes downwind.  The ones into the wind you better be careful. 

 Q.  What do you think about the difference between teeing off earlier than later? 
 TOM WATSON:  Didn't make much difference.  It started blowing a little bit harder about halfway through the round.  It wasn't that big a deal. 

 Q.  They say it's tough, but it's definitely fair with the way the tees were positioned? 
 TOM WATSON:  They moved up the tees in particular on the last few holes here.  It made it so you didn't have to hit 3-woods over the water at 17.  So thank you very much.  They use their common sense usually here at the PGA. 

 Q.  Talk about that final stretch of four holes coming back into the wind today? 
 TOM WATSON:  I played some decent shots.  I hit a good shot at 15.  Good drives at 15 and at 16 and 18.  I hit some good irons to 15 and 16.  I didn't hit a very good iron at 14 or 17, but I still got it, I got pars out of it. 
 No, it's a fun challenge to get the right distance.  That's the main thing in the wind.  Can you hit it the right distance.  On a golf course with this type of wind and kind of blind shots here and there, it's a challenge. 

 Q.  The challenge doesn't take away from the fun of playing this golf course? 
 TOM WATSON:  No, I enjoy it.  It's a fun golf course to play.
