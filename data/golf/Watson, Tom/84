 Q.   Assess the round.  
TOM WATSON:   I had no birdies today.   When you make no birdies at Birkdale, you're going to shoot over par.   The course softened up a little bit from the rain and it was there for the taking, if you played some quality shots.   
I didn't get the ball real close to the hole, but I hit the ball pretty well, made a few mistakes and those mistakes cost me bogeys and I didn't make the putts that I had the opportunities to make for birdies, and it was a 73.  
   
 Q.   What with as it like, your first time at Birkdale, the Senior Open in a competitive manner?   How was that?  
TOM WATSON:   I remember a lot from years past playing here.   I thought that helped me on a few holes out there today, but I wish I remembered how I putted back in those days.   I didn't putt very well today.   
   
 Q.   Where do you think this puts you going into tomorrow?   What can you work on?   What can you learn from the first round?  
TOM WATSON:   The most important thing is‑‑ I played pretty well from tee‑to‑green.   I give myself a grade of about a B minus, so I played pretty well, better than average.   
I was about a D, D minus in the putting department, so I need to get that grade a lot higher tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you've experienced this as 'The Open'; how does it differ for the Senior Open?   
TOM WATSON:   Well, to me, there's no difference at all.   You play the same golf course.   You're playing under competition.   You're trying to win a golf tournament.   There's no difference at all.
