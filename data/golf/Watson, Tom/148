  Q. How did you do for round two?  
 TOM WATSON: Well I didn't play very well. The course got me today. I shot 76. And I'm kind of grateful for that. I finished the back nine 1-under par and shot 5-over the front side.   
 It looked like I was kind of down the road there for awhile, but I made a few birdies on the back, which I finished with a birdie at 18. So I'm still in the golf tournament, but I'm a long way away from the leaders.  
  
  Q. What was the biggest difference do you think between yesterday and today?  
 TOM WATSON: Well for me it was I just, overall, I didn't hit my irons very well today and didn't putt worth a darn.
