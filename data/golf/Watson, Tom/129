 Q. Your score today? 
 TOM WATSON: 75 doesn't deserve much of a talk. 

 Q. What were the crowds out there like? 
 TOM WATSON: Ten deep. Freddy played well; I played lousy, and he's in a good position to win the tournament. 

 Q. Did you say something to Freddy to help him make the putt on 9? 
 TOM WATSON: I just said "good putt!"
He played very well. Didn't make very many mistakes, and when he did -- 6 was a turning point, you'll hear from him about that. 

 Q. Have you played in a lot of electric atmospheres, St. Andrews when you went up 18 and Norman knocked in the eagle? How does that atmosphere compare to today's? 
 TOM WATSON: It was high energy, very high energy, a lot of loud voices, a lot of loud cheering. It was something that we love to play in front of. This is terrific. You don't get crowds like this on our Tour very often. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOM WATSON: Well, it was -- there have been a few. A lot of them, the U.S. Senior Opens. We have gone to different venues, and last year we had enormous crowds at Crooked Stick. Tribute to the USGA going to places where people are starved for golf, in a certain sense and that's -- it's a great formula for success. You get a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy from the crowds, and it's a lot of fun to play in front of crowds like this, with the exception of playing so lousy. Thank you.
