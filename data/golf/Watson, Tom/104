 Q.   I'm here with Tom Watson.   Finished the week at 1 over par.   Can you just talk about overall thoughts on the week and the crowds here in the Detroit area.   
TOM WATSON:   Well, I think the crowds mirrored the fact that people really love the game of golf up here in Michigan.   They came out.   There are a lot of people out there watching us out here at Indianwood.  
The course is certainly a difficult golf course.   It stood up to the Championship test, and as I look at it right now, there's about 13 holes to go.   Looks like it's going to be a horse race.  
   
 Q.   Great.   Thank you and good luck in the British Open.   
TOM WATSON:   Thank you.
