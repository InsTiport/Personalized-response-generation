Q. Going out and coming in, it seemed like two different nines?
TOM WATSON: Well, sure they are.  A lot of times the direction in nine holes, the other nine holes, it's the opposite direction.  The wind blew hard today.  It was a tough inward nine here.  I made some mistakes and I paid the penalty for them.
Q. Overall, besides the mistakes you make, how would you look at your game right now and your optimism heading into tomorrow?
TOM WATSON: Well, I made two no-brain putts.  In the dip in front of No. 5 for eagle and probably about an 85 or 95-foot putt at No. 13 for birdie, but yet I didn't play a very good second shot in No. 14.  Put it in one of the little pot bunkers and ended up making 7 there, double-bogey.  That didn't make me very happy there.  But you know, all in all, I played some quality shots today and I was happy about the way I played.  It was a tough golf course.  She was tough today.
Q. You're still in the mix going into the final round.  Nice to be in the Top-10?
TOM WATSON: Well, it's good to be in the position.  I wish I had just been a couple shots lower, because it's going to take -- this course, it always bunches up.  The players seem like they always bunch up on this golf course.  Right now, I'm in a bunch just behind the leaders and going to have to play some really good golf tomorrow to be -- to come out in front.
