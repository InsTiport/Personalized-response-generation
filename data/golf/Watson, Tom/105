Q.   You started off pretty strong today with an eagle on 1 and then lost a little momentum.   Can you talk about that?
TOM WATSON:   I played a good front nine.   And the back nine, hit a couple of long irons that weren't very good at the par 3s.   It didn't cost me at the 16th, but it cost me at the 13th.
On 18, I pushed my drives just a little bit and was in the wiry rough and made bogey there.
I played a little bit better today than I did the first couple rounds.   So there's some light at the end of the tunnel there, I have to say.   So there is something to be pleased about.

Q. Could you talk a little bit about playing with amateur Sean Knapp today?   I know you played with an amateur in the first couple of rounds as well.   How that affects your game or how you view playing with an amateur in an event like this.
TOM WATSON:   Well, we're all doing the same thing.   Doesn't matter whether it's an amateur or pro.   We're all trying to score our best.
Sean got off to a really good start, and he eagled the 1st hole, and he just barely missed birdie putts on the first‑‑ basically, the first five holes.   The next four holes, he just skimmed right by it.
Didn't play very well after that, but he got off to a really good start.

Q.   How was the course different today than maybe the two days preceding it?
TOM WATSON:   Well, it was a little bit less wind today so the scores should be a little bit better, I think.   The flag positions are in some difficult locations, probably a little bit more difficult today than they were yesterday.   We'll see what happens.
I know that there's some good scores being shot out there early, but coming in is another story.
