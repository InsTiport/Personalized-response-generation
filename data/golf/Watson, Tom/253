Q.  Just talk about what happened out there for you?
TOM WATSON:  Well, the golf course played tough today with the wind, especially the back nine with several holes playing into the wind.  12, 16, 17, they play tough.  18, I made a mistake there.  I made double bogey there.  But all in all I'm happy about the way I played for the week and it's a good tournament and I'm -- I done pretty well here at Valhalla my three times playing.
Q.  Glad it's over?
TOM WATSON:  Yeah.
Q.  It was an incredible thing that you did.
TOM WATSON:  Well, I think Mark Wilson and his crew, I don't know if they got any sleep at all this week.  They deserve everything that they got, plus more.  And a little pizza goes a long way, I hope.  I hope that after all night or last night like they had to pull, they had a chance to sit down and relax a little bit and enjoy and watch a little bit of the tournament.
Q.  You got a Standing O from them?
TOM WATSON:  Yeah, when I went by.  But they deserve everything, they deserve all the kudos of getting this course ready so we can finish today.  It very well could have been that we would have been playing into Tuesday.
Q.  Talk about the future of Valhalla.  Just the way it's hosted these championships.
TOM WATSON:  Well, I think that Valhalla is a very good championship golf course.  The technology has made it play a little bit shorter and it's an issue in any golf course these days is how much of a challenge is it going to be against the best players in the world.  When it was built-in '86, yes, it was a great challenge.  But now the golf ball goes 25 yards farther, and it makes the golf course play a lot shorter.  So that's going to have to be addressed in future tournaments for this tournament here.
