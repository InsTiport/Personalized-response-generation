   SEVE BENSON:  Struggling all day really, the last five holes really I got some momentum really going my way and brought it back.  Just shows what happens when you don't give up. 

 Q.  You had a blip on the front nine with a couple of bogeys? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Yeah, a double. 

 Q.  Were you thinking, 'I need to hang in there'? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Yeah, doesn't really do -- one bad shot, it's just when you get in that rough really, the edge of the fairway, you just can't get nowhere but a couple of errant shots here and there but I managed to keep it together so it was all right. 

 Q.  What do you think of the setup here? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Perfect, yeah, it's really good.  You mean practise facilities as well. 

 Q.  Just everything? 
 SEVE BENSON:  It's fantastic. 

 Q.  You're attached to Wentworth? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Not really attached; you're still an amateur. 
 SEVE BENSON:  I'm an amateur, yes.  It's not great conditions obviously because of the weather. 
 But no, it's a nice club to be a member of really. 

 Q.  I think it's been about four years since we last had Seve featuring at a weekend of a European Tour event, how do you feel about that? 
 SEVE BENSON:  It's nice to have a name like that really.  But, you know, it's just I'll carry on his good work.  Never really thought about it that way. 

 Q.  Have you always been sort of destined to take up golf?  You must have grown up with it? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Pretty much had a club in my hand at 18 months old.  I guess could you say that. 

 Q.  Is he your hero? 
 SEVE BENSON:  Yeah, and Tiger Woods. 

 Q.  Your thoughts on the weekend, you have all to play for. 
 SEVE BENSON:  Yeah, just going to keep doing what I'm doing really, just keep sticking in there, keep being patient, keep going and that's all I can do.
