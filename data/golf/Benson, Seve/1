  SEVE BENSON:   Just sort of got momentum early doors, carried it right the way through.   A little hiccup on 18 there but just chose sort of the wrong shot for the wrong lie but apart from that, very solid round.

Q.   On a day like that, we shouldn't concentrate on the hiccup but given that was two into the water, and yet such a wonderful score despite that?
SEVE BENSON:   I did really well to get up‑and‑down the second time actually.   But yeah, as I said just sort of chose the wrong shot for the lie I had in the fairway there.   Came up short in the water.   But hindsight is always a great thing, isn't it.

Q.   Must be wonderful to get on runs like this, four birdies in five holes and then a flawless back nine?
SEVE BENSON:   Yeah, it was just kind of‑‑ didn't really realise I was doing it.   Was just playing each shot as it was coming.   Just enjoying it, really, trying to hole putts and they were dropping.

Q.   That clichÃ© thing of being in the zone but you phase‑out everything else and don't really appreciate what you're doing all the time?
SEVE BENSON:   I guess so.   It's only when you get time to think that you reflect on it.   No, very happy. 

Q.   Does that mean you're in a very good place golf‑wise at the moment? 
SEVE BENSON:   I think so.   As I said yesterday, just sort of really working hard on trying to improve and things I can improve on.   I feel good.   I'm fit, which is nice.   Injured again last year, so toe have that not on my mind is quite nice and able to just focus on my golf. 

Q.   Sorry to focus on the injury, but what are you doing to manage your back?
SEVE BENSON:   Hitting less shots.   Warming up and warming down is the big things that I'm doing, because I wasn't sort of doing that as much, or properly.   Just making sure my back is ready to go when I start hitting shots.   That's been the key, really.   Try and improve my posture a little bit is not always easy, being tall.   But little things like that. 

Q.   And is this down to some medical advice? 
SEVE BENSON:   I had a couple of scans and worked out what the problem was.   I had to have a lot of rest last year.   Took three months off.   Rebuild my swing, really, from the ground up, my posture and everything at address, making sure my right muscles are turned on.   There's a whole bunch of things really to go into.   Just making sure that I sort of recover well and look after it, really.   I need to look after it.

Q.   I take it takes a little while for those things to become natural, second nature?
SEVE BENSON:   Definitely.   I still sort of creep back to old habits on the golf course.   That's to be expected I think.   But off the golf course, it's definitely improving.   Just a matter of time before it works on the golf course a bit better.
