 Q.   You seemed to get off to a nice start?  
SEVE BENSON:   Yeah, around 10,11, 12, 13, 14, is probably a good stretch of the course where you can really pick up some shots.   So managed to make the most of that today.  
   
 Q.   You might not be in a position to comment, but it seems, unusually, that of an afternoon, the course is proving that little bit better.   Is it that much more approachable in terms of some of those greens?  
SEVE BENSON:   You'd probably think the opposite to be honest.   You would think the greens wouldn't be softer and easier to hold in the afternoon, but obviously the scores are a bit better in the afternoon, so I don't know.  
   
 Q.   A course you like?  
SEVE BENSON:   Yeah, I love it.   It's tree‑lined, just a really pretty course, just old‑fashioned.   It's great.  
   
 Q.   You've played alongside David Higgins, who is our leader at the moment and he's saying he likes the old‑fashioned nature.   You don't really get courses like that on Tour any more, do you?  
SEVE BENSON:   No, I keep saying, you don't really need to make courses long and wide and lots of water everywhere.   Just get it short, get it firm, get lots of rough around the course, not tricked up, I like it.  
   
 Q.   Not the first time we've seen you up there, so presumably there's a buoyancy about your game?   
SEVE BENSON:   Yeah, playing all right.   Just as I keep saying, just keep trying to improve what I'm doing, keep trying to focus on my game, and let the rest take care of itself really.
