Q.   Talk to me about your about your round today.   How it went, do you think?
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   I hit a lot of fairways, a few fairways, a few greens, and it was a good solid round.   A lot of pars, two birdies, two bogeys, and a couple good up‑and‑downs.   It was a tough day.   The wind's really tough.   A lot of cross wind shots.   So you had to shape a lot of shots today.

Q.   So did it, how did the wind compare to what it was like in the practice rounds?
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   It was quite a bit stronger.   Well, on Monday it was pretty strong.   But it's a lot warmer now.   So the ball's carrying, which is good.   But, yeah, it's pretty strong. 
Especially when you get up to 7.   I had a birdie putt on 7 and the ball was actually shaking on the green because the wind was so strong.   And I was wondering whether the ball was going to stay still or not.   That's how strong it was blowing.

Q.   How were the greens, did you have a lot of ‑‑ everyone talks about all the double breaks.   Talk about them. 
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   They're tough.   You try to strategize it playing into the green, but if you don't hit it exactly where you want to, you catch a different kind of slope and you get a much different roll.   And so sometimes you end up going over the green when you didn't think you were going to or you come up way short when you thought you were going to be just right.   And it really makes you think. 
And when you add the elements of this kind of wind, it just augments the difficulty and the amount of focus and concentration required.
