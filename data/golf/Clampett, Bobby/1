 Q.   Talk us through your fifth hole, your eagle on the fifth.   
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   Oh, I hit a real good drive there, I had 245 front, and it was one of those second shots where I was really trying to put the ball just to the left of the green and I didn't hit a very good 3‑wood, I hit it a little low on the face and the ball cut a little more than I wanted to with the wind and hit the down slope there and rolled up just short of the green and then I holed a 60‑footer.   
   
 Q.   It was a putt or chip?  
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   It was a putt.  
   
 Q.   Off the green?  
BOBBY CLAMPETT:   Yeah.
