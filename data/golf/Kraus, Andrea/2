 Q.  Two extra holes, matches today.  Kind of give us your feeling after surviving beating obviously the medalist who played so consistently all week and knocking off the defending champion.  
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah, I try not to put a lot of thought into who I'm playing.  Just try to play my own game.  I had a really long day with two really long matches against two terrific players.   
You know, it wasn't flawless golf.  We were tired.  By the end it was who could survive, and I happened to survive today.  It's really exciting.  I'm delighted.   
 Q.  Your first championship match.  How do you think you'll handle this?  
ANDREA KRAUS: I don't know.  I'll do my best.   
 Q.  I'm sure you'll sleep well.  Probably exhausted.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I have a terrific caddie and he says nice, sweet, calming things like, Breathe, relax, and it's all in good fun.  I smile.  I was prepared to lose.  I mean, I'm delighted to be where I am, so there are a lot of really --   
 Q.  Yeah.  After all these years of playing USGA championships -- I don't know how many USGA championships you've played in, but --  
ANDREA KRAUS: I think I've played in like 35 or 36, so it is pretty nice to finally get to a final.  It really is.  Really excited.   
 Q.  What's your caddie's name?  
ANDREA KRAUS: John.   
 Q.  J-o-h-n?  
ANDREA KRAUS: J-o-h-n.   
 Q.  What's his last name?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Um, beach.   
 Q.  B-e --  
ANDREA KRAUS: -- a-c-h.   
 Q.  Is he a local?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Local caddie, but not from Wellesley.  He caddies at Brae Burn.   
 Q.  He caddies at Brae Burn, okay.  
ANDREA KRAUS: And I'm staying with a good friend of mine who I met in 1997 when I played the U.S. Amateur.  She was my hostess then.   
 Q.  Wow.  What's her name?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Her name is Debbie Silverstein.   
 Q.  Okay.  
ANDREA KRAUS: And she got me John.  She said I would love him.  I tried to resist and tell her to caddie, but after one day with John, I'm like, Yeah.  I'm going to stick with him.  He's pretty good.   
 Q.  On 18 you missed the green and she's in the fairway and she misses the green.  What were your thought -- I mean...  
ANDREA KRAUS: I didn't have any thoughts.  Oh, good.  I get to hit another.  I don't like that chip.  That's basically where my thoughts were.   
 Q.  Did you feel pretty fortunate at that point that she made an unforced error there and you got out of there with a halve and got to go to extra hole?  Probably could maybe win it there.  
ANDREA KRAUS: She hit a lot of really good shots today.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I guess I should say I dodged a bullet.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ANDREA KRAUS: But, you know, we were so tired.  I didn't really expect that she automatically was going to get it to the flag.   
 Q.  Right.  Then what happened on -- I guess 19 she had some trouble.  Fairway, bunker, then another bunker.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I hit a really good shot in there.  I thought it was perfect.  It just rolled over the edge.  We ended up in the same spot but I was a shot ahead at that point after her second bunker shot.   
I just hit a really good chip.  That was my chip of the week.   
 Q.  Yeah.  I heard like maybe a foot?  Almost went in?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah, almost went in but it was about a foot, yeah.   
 Q.  Thoughts about playing -- now you'll get a six-time champion tomorrow in Ellen Port.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I've played Ellen before.  Years -- I've only played Ellen once and I believe it was probably my very first mid-amateur he is section county club and I think she won.  I think she won this one.   
 Q.  Okay?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Might have been her first.  It was a good match even back then.  I don't know if you can find it.   
 Q.  Oh, we can probably find it.  What year was it?  Probably early '90s?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Early '90s.   
 Q.  We'll look it up.  All right, we're going to do nine questions with you, fun stuff.  What's your favorite club in the bag?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Driver.   
 Q.  What's where you most memorable golf experience?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Having a hole-in-one the same day I gave birth to my son.   
 Q.  What's your son's name?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Matthew.   
 Q.  What year was that?  
ANDREA KRAUS: 1989.   
 Q.  Where was it?  
ANDREA KRAUS: At my home course.  I had a hole-in-one, and I didn't realize that I should have nicknamed him Ace.  Only figured it out now, years later.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Who influenced you the most?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Well no one.  I mean, my mom started playing when I did.   
 Q.  Okay.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I just took a liking to the game.  I really never had instructor or anything.  Now I've had an instructor and I take a couple lessons, but had to sort of teach myself at first.   
 Q.  Who rounds out your dream foursome?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Dream foursome?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ANDREA KRAUS: I don't really -- I don't know.  Let me think.  My favorite golfers.  Who are my favorite golfers, honey?   
I don't have a dream foursome.  I don't put a lot of stock in like celebrity and all that.   
 Q.  Even like a professional player you wouldn't love to play with, three people on the pro tour?  
ANDREA KRAUS: Oh, yeah.  Okay, I would've liked to play with Annika Sorenstam.  I would like to play with -- I did play Se Ri Pak once.   
 Q.  Yeah, I know that.  
ANDREA KRAUS: In a U.S. Am here, but wouldn't be her.  I just like to play with my friends.  Dream foursome is really a funny question.  I don't really have one.
