Q. Overall thoughts?  You played really well in the first nine holes.  Come out the chute, make a birdie; make a birdie on 9.
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah, it's been a bit of a struggle all week with my swing.  It was sheer grit and determination really that the got me here.
I hit more greens the other days.  Maybe yesterday took a little out of me.  I just didn't really have my best game, but I had the best I could do today.
I accept it.  It was great to get here and great to get to the final.  I just heard from a Pam Kuong.  I get lots of exemptions.
Q. U.S. Amateur, U.S. Mid-Amateur.
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah.
Q. What you do you think of that?  Think you'll make the trip out to San Diego?
ANDREA KRAUS: Absolutely.  Maybe my friend Corey Weworski will house me and maybe she'll try for it too.  Absolutely.  That's in San Diego, and the Mid-Am is?
Q. Florida.
ANDREA KRAUS: Florida.  And the Senior is in --
Q. -- Portland.
ANDREA KRAUS: So I will make them all.  I am going to do it all.  I didn't get to play last year, so I get to make up for it.
Q. Your thoughts on Ellen.  She's won seven USGA championships now.  She is in the same bracket with Carol with the number of matches.
ANDREA KRAUS: Ellen is amazing and a dear friend.  Lovely human being.  I give her incredible kudos.  She has a family.  She does it all.  Great for her.  She played well.
I think Ellen can even play better than that.
Q. She was under par today.
ANDREA KRAUS: Oh, she was?
Q. Well, with concessions.  I know she had two conceded birdies, but you guys both made birdies on 12.
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah, that was a great -- you know, I needed that.  I had a few chances at making putts during the day, and that's really the only one I made.
Q. Yeah, missed one on 11.
ANDREA KRAUS: Just feel like I wasn't aligned right today and never really got into my zone.  I tried.  I tried my hardest.
Q. Sum up your week.  You get to a final, your first final.
ANDREA KRAUS: Absolutely.  So exciting.  I'm delighted.  I wish I could bring home the trophy.  Ellen has had it so many times.  So many.  But that's because she's great and I'm spotty.
Q. Well, maybe next year.
ANDREA KRAUS: Maybe next year.  I might have to bring my caddie, because I must say, he was tremendous.  What a happy-go-lucky wonderful guy to have with me all week.
Q. And it's B-e...
ANDREA KRAUS: Beach, like going to the beach swimming.
Q. Peter?
ANDREA KRAUS: No, John.  John Beach.  Yeah, he really is the one who got me there.  Read the greens unbelievably well and just so pleasant to be with.  Smiling, happy.
Q. That's always a good combination?
ANDREA KRAUS: Yeah, sure.  Absolutely.  Just happy-go-lucky.  So I was blessed in all ways.  Wellesley Country Club is fantastic.
Q. Yeah, nice place.
