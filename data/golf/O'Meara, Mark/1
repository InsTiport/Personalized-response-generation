 Q. Could you tell me a little bit about your hole‑in‑one?  
MARK O'MEARA: Yeah, listen, it's always exciting to play and compete in the Par‑3 Contest. It was great to be out there with Brooks and D.J.  
And on the 5th hole, I think it was 127 or 128 yards and I hit a 9‑iron and Brooks was like, wow, that looks pretty good when it was in the air and I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever. And it hits about literally three inches behind the hole and must have went and came back just a little bit and went in the hole for a hole‑in‑one. So that was exciting.   
   
 Q. Congratulations.   
MARK O'MEARA: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
