   MARK O'MEARA: Obviously 51 years of age, 1-under par, I played all right. I made a couple of bad putts. I birdied 11, 12, and 13; that's always nice when you get around those holes.   
 The golf course is in good condition. There wasn't much wind out there today, but the scoring is always pretty good at Augusta National even when it's not windy and pretty soft.  
  
  Q. Do you see it getting more difficult?  
 MARK O'MEARA: I think as it dries out a little bit, if the wind comes up, that's what really comes into play here. And with the lengthening of the golf course now, even the powerful players don't eat up the par-5s like they once did coming in with shorter irons and things like that.   
 Some of the pins were pretty good out there today. Ian played extremely well, made that hole-in-one on 16, got a big roar from the crowd. I'm just pleased to shoot under par anytime I play Augusta National.
