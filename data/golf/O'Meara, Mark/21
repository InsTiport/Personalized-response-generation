 Q.   Talk about the birdie on 18.   
MARK O'MEARA:   It was a nice way to finish.   Obviously I was fortunate I hit a good drive in the fairway and Shane, I had like 180 or something, but it was a little downwind and I was thinking between six and seven and he felt like a big seven, because it looked short.   
Fortunately, I hit a good solid shot and left it about 18 feet left of the hole and ran that putt in.   So that was a nice way to finish.   
I made about a 12‑footer for birdie on 14 after the delay having to go out.   And that was my first actual shot was a putt.   And I made that.   
So overall 3‑under was a good score.   I played better today, I didn't play great, but I played better.   I had some opportunities that I missed, but it's never bad shooting 3‑under on a course like this.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel going into tomorrow?  
MARK O'MEARA:   The way I felt, the last month I've been battling a little bit of a virus or I don't know what I've had, but it's been kind of a drag, and I haven't felt really up to snuff with my health this week.   But hopefully tomorrow I'll feel a little bit better and I can get out there and play a good solid round and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Did the rain have any impact on the last couple holes?  
MARK O'MEARA:   Not really.   No.   It didn't get enough rain really to make that big a difference.
