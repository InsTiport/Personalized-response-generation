   MARK O'MEARA: Yeah, I wasn't pleased. You know I didn't hit it that bad, but I made a double at No. 12 yesterday and then again today. I didn't putt really well. That's kind of the way it's been this year. It's been a rough year for me. I've been trying to get better but it hasn't been so great.
