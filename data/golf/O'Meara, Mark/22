Q.   Can you talk a little bit about your round today?
MARK O'MEARA:   I played a little better today than I did yesterday.   I still am not feeling that great, so I kind of battled around with that.   But I hit a few good shots, I hit a couple of not so good ones, but 1â€‘under is a reasonable score out there.   I just got to play a little better on the weekend.

Q.   How was the course playing today compared to yesterday?
MARK O'MEARA:   It was a little easier today from the standpoint we didn't have the rain and some of the wind.   Yesterday it was playing pretty long.   Today, nice weather, nice sunshine, but still, it's a good golf course.   There's some good pins out there.
