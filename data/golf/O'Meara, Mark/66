   MARK O'MEARA:  I started with a double on the first hole and played back with Sam (Torrance). 
 I kept it in play and my short game has really been good. My short game that has been something that has kept me alive in the tournament for sure. If I had hit the ball better tomorrow and putt and chip the way I have I should do alright. I certainly need to play better. 
 We had a little bit of all seasons out there today. The wind was whipping really hard and then we had rain and wind and then no wind for about a hole and a half. It's picked up again. I've played professional golf for 26 years now and I think all of you know my passion for links golf. Certainly playing here in Scotland or the Irish Open or The Open Championship last week. To be able to play here ids a treat. I wish could have finished it a little bit better and hopefully tomorrow I'll play well and give myself an opportunity. 

 Q.  Would you prefer wind tomorrow? 
 MARK O'MEARA:  Yeah, I'd like to have it play tough. I don't have a problem with that. The best player is going to win no matter what happens.  The more wind blows the tougher the test is. The better it is for the guy playing well. I feel my short game has kept me in the tournament up to this point. Tomorrow for me to win I've going to have to hit the ball a little bit better than I have been for sure. 
 I have a lot of respect for the way the game is played here. The fans are very knowledgeable and they come out and support the event which is very special.
