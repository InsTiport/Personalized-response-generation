Q.   A 65 today, one of the best rounds of the tournament.   Can you talk a little bit about it?
MARK O'MEARA:   Well, I was pleased.   I got off to a good start.   I made couple good putts on the first few holes, like 20 or 25 footers which helped get the day going.   And I played okay.   I hit some good shots on the back nine and you certainly got to make putts to make a score.
The way I felt this week, still dealing with kind of a little bit of a virus, I'm on antibiotics, and the fact that I was 4‑over the first day through about 11 or 12 holes, I was glad that I battled back and fought hard.   It's a good golf course and it looks like I might come up a little bit short, but I was proud of the way I played today for sure.

Q.   Can you talk specifically about the eagle you made on 17. 
MARK O'MEARA:   I made an eagle there on the second round.   And today I hit a very nice dive drive and a good 3‑wood to about 22, 23 feet behind the hole.   And I hit a good putt.   It was probably just a little firmer than I would have liked, but it went right in the middle. 
I had a good chance on 18 and ran it over the edge for birdie, which would have got me to 9, 7‑under for the day.   So I gave it a good shot, I think I was just too far behind starting the day, to be honest.

Q.   And then I know you kind of improved each round this week.   What kind of areas of the game kind of led to that?
MARK O'MEARA:   I think I could have ‑‑ well, if I was going to be judging my game, today when I hit some of the hard holes I hit some good shots.   I drove it good.   I think if I would have drove the ball a little better this week, my iron play was pretty good and I putted okay.   My short game was decent.
