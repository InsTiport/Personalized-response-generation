   MARK O'MEARA: It's his mind and his heart, that's the big element. But certainly Rory has those qualities. Ball-striking-wise at 19, he's probably better than what Tiger was at 19. His technique I think is better. Certainly Tiger has developed his game and swing over the years and made modifications to be able to hit the ball pin-high, but Rory is already doing that and he's 19, so he's already a step ahead.  
 Granted, he has the notoriety and people have expected a lot out of him, certainly in Europe, and they are going to see what he can do. Obviously he's going to win quite a few tournaments, not only on The European Tour, but in America, too, and there's no reason why he can't win a lot of major championships. He's got it.   
 I understand today he shot 8-under and played very solid, but it was a pretty easy 8-under to be honest with you. He made it look pretty simple. It was a joy to play with him and he's a tremendous young man. He handles himself extremely well, way above his years in maturity so, to me that's just as important to as well as he plays and his technique. So nothing but bright things ahead for him for sure.
