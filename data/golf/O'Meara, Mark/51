  Q. Reflections on the week that was.   
 MARK O'MEARA: It was nice. I got off to a rough start on the back side the first day. I was 7-over after eight holes, where I made a double and triple on 15 and 16, two par-5s. And one of them with a perfect drive.   
 It was disheartening. But I could have packed it in and I didn't, I kept hanging in there and fighting and to shoot 70, 69, 68, that was a good accomplishment. So I won a little bit of the battle, I didn't certainly win tournament, but at least I fought back.   
  
  Q. Go ahead and reflect back about, I know we talked about it a lot, but 30 years ago and today.   
 MARK O'MEARA: That's so long ago, you know. It seems like it was ages ago, 30 years ago. But that was the spring board for my career. Certainly what happened here that September day in here at Canterbury in '79 winning the Amateur, that gave me a little bit, not that I was ever over confident, because I never am, but it gave me a little bit of the confidence to maybe take the next step and look at professional golf.   
 And now here I am 30 years later winning 31, 30 tournaments around the world and 16 in the United States and the great success that I've had on the TOUR. I propel it all back to the Canterbury win here in '79. So I feel very fortunate to have played this great game for a long time. It's a tough one. It's a tough game. Very tough.
