  Q. How do you think your first round went?  
 MARK O'MEARA: It went okay. It was a little bit of a battle out there, conditions were pretty tough, the wind was blowing pretty good.   
 And I hit some not so good shots. I hit some irons that I thought were going to be good shots and they bounced over the green. So that kind of hurt a little bit. But overall I would give myself a rating of about a seven today. So not bad.   
 I hope tomorrow with the less wind in the morning I can go out and shoot a good score and get it in the red and hopefully go low on the weekend.  
  
  Q. Did you encounter any struggles throughout the course that you will deal with differently tomorrow?  
 MARK O'MEARA: No, I mean it is a golf course that takes some local knowledge, but I played here a couple years ago after about a year of it being open and it's, I think the difficulty is when the wind's blowing, because certainly at the altitude the ball goes further, so you got to make that adjustment, but here you got a lot of change of elevation too. I mean just in your shot pattern. So you got to take a lot of things, the uphill 10 yards, downhill 10 yards, altitude, the ball goes 10, 12 percent further, and then the wind blowing. So it was overall it was okay.   
  
  Q. Are you going to try and change anything by tomorrow?  
 MARK O'MEARA: No, just try to drive it a little bit better and hit, get the ball a little closer to the hole and pin high and try to make some more birdies and eliminate the bogeys.  
  
  Q. Do you think playing in the morning tomorrow is going to make things go a little better?  
 MARK O'MEARA: Oh, yeah I think it will help tomorrow for sure. Less wind.
