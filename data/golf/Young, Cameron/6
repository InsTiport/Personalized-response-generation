Q. Off to a good start.CAMERON YOUNG: Yeah, it was.  I got off to a really good start.  I parred 1, and made a 12-footer from birdie on 2 and made one from the bunker on 3 for eagle.  So I kind of got off to a quick start and took some pressure off early which is nice.Q. What did you hit into the bunker?CAMERON YOUNG: I hit driver.  I had 255, and a 3-iron in the bunker, and just had one kind of hit the flagstick a little hard.Q. Regular sand wedge?CAMERON YOUNG: 60-degree sand wedge.Q. So you're off to a good start.  What was good about what was going on the rest of the way?CAMERON YOUNG: I really kept it in play all day.  Gave myself chances to hit the green.  For the most part hit it on the right section of the green, and it gave me a lot of flat putts and lot of good looks at birdie, easy two-putts.Q. You walked up to that putt at 18 like you knew it was going in.  You didn't take much time with it.CAMERON YOUNG: No, actually, I watched for about five minutes here, watched the group come through and getting the exact same putt missed it just high, so I had a pretty good lineup.Q. Because you've played in so many of these USGA events, where does your mindset go going into that second round of qualifying?CAMERON YOUNG: It really stays the same.  I had a set game plan in the practice rounds because that's what I thought was best for me, and I'm just going to stick to it because it doesn't change anything.  I still have to go out and play well.
