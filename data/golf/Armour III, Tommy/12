  Q. (Question about how day went.)   
 TOMMY ARMOUR: It was a good day. A lot of good shots. Didn't miss any shots. Missed a couple putts but that happens in 72 holes.  
  
  Q. It sure does. Tell me how different it was coming out today because the wind really picked up when you y'all got out there?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR: Fortunately, all year we've been playing in wind. So what was abnormal was no wind the first couple of days.   
 So, you know, it was just like here we go with the wind. So it was no problem.  
  
  Q. Tell me about that little bit of a rain delay. Because it was like they got all the players off the course and normally when they do that, the rain delays are little longer than just an hour.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR: I was fine with a quick one. I wanted to get back out there and play.  
  
  Q. I bet you did. Great playing this week, Tommy. Looks like you might come up a little short, but we were happy to see you playing so well.
