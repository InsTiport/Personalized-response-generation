JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Tommy, thanks for joining us.  You followed up a great round 64 with an even better 62.  Start with some opening comments about your day today. 

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    I hit a lot of good shots, made some putts, and there I am.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  14 greens today, 25 putts, anything in particular that's going well for you out there as far as what you're doing differently or are putts just falling.

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    Putts are falling.  I'm working on some things and sometimes it pans out that you're working on the right things.  Two greens I missed.  I was on the fringe.  You know, what can you say.  It's going where I'm aiming.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  You're co-leader in the clubhouse so you're off to a good start.  We'll take some questions.


Q.  Have you done pretty well here over the years?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    I've played pretty well on this course over the years.


Q.  What in particular about this course?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    I don't know.  It fits my eye, shots look right.  Other than that, I can't tell you.


Q.  When you see the birdie fest that went on yesterday and all those low scores we had on the first day, did you have to change your thinking going into Round 2 as to what it's going to take?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    My thinking changed when I played the practice round.


Q.  You knew it was going to be --

TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yes.


Q.  Because?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    Just because.  Because I've been out here 21 years and can look at a course and can tell when the rough is not that high and the course is in great shape, the greens are perfect.  When you put all those things together, it's a birdie fest.


Q.  Do you anticipate staying that way throughout the weekend?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    Unless the weather changed dramatically and I don't think it's supposed to.  I think it's supposed to be 85, 88 every day, not much wind.


Q.  How did you feel about the greens speed-wise?  What do you think about the stint?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    It all depends on the putts you have.  Down grain putts get a little quicker.  I don't know what they are, 10 or something like that.  It doesn't matter what speed the greens are for us anymore.  It really doesn't.  The faster the better for all these guys, because you don't have to hit putts as hard.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Eight birdies, you started on the front side, par 5, No. 1.

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    Hit a drive, 3-iron, and wedge about three feet and made it.

5, that was one of the greens I missed.  I chipped in.  That was nice.

8, I hit a 2-iron, pitching wedge, about four feet.

9, I hit a driver, pitching wedge, about 20 feet and made it.

11, I hit a sand wedge to about 5 feet.

12, I hit a 6-iron to about 11 feet.

14, I hit a driver, 2-iron, about 18 feet from the hole, 2-putted.

18, I hit a driver, 9-iron, about 12 feet.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Any problem with mud on the ball out there?  A couple of players mentioned that.

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    There's definitely mud on the ball.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Not too many problems, obviously, a 62.

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    There's a lot of mud on the ball.


Q.  Your overall impression of the day and the fact that you're 14-under going into the week, how do you feel about that?

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    14 is better than 13.  I'm glad.  14-under after two rounds, I'm glad.  I haven't shot that too often, 126.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Lowest on the PGA Tour this year so far.


Q. To see your name up there on the top.

TOMMY ARMOUR III:    That's why we come to tournaments.  That's what we do.  I think that's a general consensus from all the players.  It's better to have your name on the top than anywhere else.

JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Tommy, thank you.  Good luck this weekend.
