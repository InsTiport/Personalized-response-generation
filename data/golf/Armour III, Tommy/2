Q.   I'm here with Tommy Armour III.   You had three birdies and a double today.   Can you take us through your round? 
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   You know, I played pretty steady. And when I missed it in the rough, I had some good lies today.   So that all worked out well.   Made some good putts, made a good par putt on 6.   And then kind of played steady.   I just hit a lot of the middle of the shot, middle of the greens and tried to drag it in the fairway, you know.   USGA event, that's what you do.

Q.   The wind kicked up this afternoon.   How did that affect the way the course played? 
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   One of my practice rounds, I played with kind of a little bit of a breeze.   So it kind of played similar to that.   So the course was a pretty good condition for this tournament.

Q.   You are 2 under par for the championship right now, just four back.   Talk about your position heading into the weekend. 
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   I haven't even looked.   I haven't really looked at the leaderboard that much.   There's a lot of golf 'til then so I'm not even really worried about that.

Q.   Great.   Thank you so much.   Appreciate it.
