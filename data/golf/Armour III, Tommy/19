  Q.  Tommy Armour III.  Great 66, final round, 13-under par for the tournament.  Got to feel good about your play.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III:  I was very happy with it.  I came down here, expected to play good, you know, and I did.   
  
  Q.  You know, you've been playing on your past champion status, and you took things into your own hands, you came out here Monday and qualified and played very well, and I guess the Top-10 gets you into New Orleans now?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III:  Yes.  That's what I was looking to do and, you know, obviously trying to win the tournament, which I gave it a good shot.  I had some opportunities out there and, you know, it was a fun week.   
  
  Q.  Does this make it any easier for you going forward as far as playing opportunities?  You're playing so good, it's a shame not to be in the field right now.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III:  Well, you know, play better and you don't have these problems.  That's what I'm trying to do.   
  
  Q.  John Maginness wrote on PGATOUR.com that you were the epitome of cool because you took matters into your own hands.   
  
  Q.  Any comment on that?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III:  Thank John.  I appreciate that.   
  
  Q.  Good playing, Tommy Armour, III.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III:  Thank you.
