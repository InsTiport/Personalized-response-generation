  Q.  Tommy, you follow up 2-under par with 4-under par.  There's nothing better than that, is there?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, 5-under would have been, but it was a good day.  I played solid, no bogeys, four birdies.  I was happy with it.   
  
  Q.  You made some key putts coming in, especially maybe the one at 15?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yeah, you know, any time you make a putt for par it's key.  I made a nice six-footer for par on 17, too, so it was a solid round.   
  
  Q.  You're known all around the world as a guy that likes to have fun.  This has got to be your kind of town.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I really don't do much when I'm at tournaments.  I wait for my off weeks to have fun.
