 Q.   Talk about the birdie on 18 to finish.   
TOMMY ARMOUR, III:   I just hit a good drive, good 6â€‘iron about 22, 23 feet and poured it right in the middle.   
   
 Q.   You moved into 11th place today, in contention now.   How do you feel going into Sunday?  
TOMMY ARMOUR, III:   Well, we'll see.   Yeah, I mean it's obviously better than I was.   
We'll see how they finish out.   
   
 Q.   Rain.   Did that affect you at all, positive, negative?   Did it do anything to the course that you saw?  
TOMMY ARMOUR, III:   Not really.   It didn't rain that much on the course.   It didn't really do anything.   Just delayed the round.
