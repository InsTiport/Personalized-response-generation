 Q.  What's it like finishing a round in near darkness? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, you know luckily I birdied the last hole so it was all right. 

 Q.  Could you even see the flag on your second shot on 18? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Oh, yeah, I was 133 yards so I wasn't that far.  I could see it.  I'm not that old yet. 

 Q.  Hey, ten birdies.  Just a great round on a course you're not familiar with.  Did you see this coming? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I've been playing pretty good and I just played one hole at a time, the old cliche.  Yeah, I played good. 

 Q.  How much of a challenge was it out there?  Because obviously getting from greens to tee box is not the easiest thing. 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It's not the easiest thing, but there's a lot of transportation so it's -- it's a long-walking course obviously.  You can tell it takes a while to play because we didn't make it through the day today. 
 But it's a good golf course, and the practice round I -- the wind was completely the other direction, so it's virtually a new course today as well. 

 Q.  Why does this course set up so well for your game? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, you know, you got drive to in play, and that's what I do. 

 Q.  What was working best for you? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Everything.  When you make ten birdies, it's all good. 

 Q.  Your putter was hot.  You were hitting it close. 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I hit it close a few times, made some putts, did everything. 

 Q.  You're top of the leaderboard.  Just some thoughts and comments going into tomorrow. 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  You know, it's the second round of the tournament and got to play hard.  You know, looking forward to it. 

 Q.  Back's okay? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yeah, just a little tight.  I mean, I've been out here for eight hours, so I just want to -- it's just a little tight.  I need to get off my feet. 

 Q.  So you're not changing the game plan for tomorrow? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No.  I'm going to hit it at my targets and go get 'em.
