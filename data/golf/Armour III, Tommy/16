 Q.  2-under-par 69 today, a little excitement as you made the turn, holing out on No. 1.  Tell us about that. 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It was a perfect number, about 108 yards to the hole, and I hit -- probably hit it about 109 yards and it sucked right back into the hole. 

 Q.  You've won this tournament, won it back in 1990.  You've played this golf course quite a bit.  How did the golf course play today? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Nice.  There wasn't any wind out there.  The course was in great shape, and I'm having fun except for a few shots here and there, but that's golf. 

 Q.  How is the state of your game right now? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Pretty good.  I'm playing pretty steady, you know, not hitting a lot of great shots, not hitting any bad shots, but hitting it pretty solid. 

 Q.  Any thoughts going into the weekend now? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Make a lot of putts.
