Q.  Are you happy with the 5 under or did you leave a few more out there?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  You leave them out there    I never think about that.
Q.  Do you think about your position after day one?  Obviously you love where you're at, I'm sure.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, 67 is better than 68 or whatever.

Yeah, you want to shoot    on this course you want to shoot as low as you can today.
Q.  In the ideal conditions, mid 70s
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, you know, last week in Milwaukee, it was 100 degrees.
Q.  Keeping an even keel, is that a key to playing today, staying on an even keel?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yeah, I think it's pretty even for all the players out here.  Just staying level and just one shot at a time.  A million times you've heard people say, it one shot at a time.
Q.  Do you think 5 under will stick today?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I didn't have a choice.
