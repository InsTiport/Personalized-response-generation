   TOMMY ARMOUR: The golf course is not very good with scoring today. Wind direction kind of kept everything crosswind, so nothing was -- I mean, it made the holes play -- the course, yeah, it was out there. The greens weren't too fast. They were receptive.

 Q. How many do you think you might have left out there based on missed putts? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: I don't really think about what I left out there or what I could have done. I just shot 68.

 Q. Are you okay with your positioning after the first round? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Oh, yeah, there was a lot of golf left to play. I'm just going to come out here and play tomorrow. There was a lot of golf left here.

 Q. The fact that the wind came up in the afternoon didn't make any problems for you? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Well, I mean, the wind was there. It made some holes play shorter. But it was never really in or down. It was kind of more quartering and crosswinds. It never really was straight in or straight down. 
 It was a south, southwest, westerly wind and that's what it does to the course.

 Q. Did it help with the heat any? 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: I knew it was going to be hot before I got here.

 Q. It's summer. 
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Right, it's summer in the Midwest. Here we are.
