  Q. Happy to get in where you're at?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: 68 is always good, I don't care where you play.   
  
  Q. The setup is pretty demanding, isn't it?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: It is. I played well today. I hit a lot of good shots and I was just shooting at the middle of the greens.   
 And, you know, I had a chance. I took a couple and it paid off.  
  
  Q. Do you like your position?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: Sure. I mean, you know, 1-under is better than even, not as good as 2-under.   
  
  Q. Some of the golfers thought it might be softer today than yesterday, did you think so?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: A little bit. A little bit. It wasn't like it was, you know, went from rock to soft. I mean it was a touch. Not a lot.   
  
  Q. Did the delay have any effect on you?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: I've played at 3:00 before. I'm a pro, you've got to be ready to play when it's time to play.   
  
  Q. What do you think about where Langer stands and what does it take to try to catch him?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: Where is he at? 3-under? It's two ahead of me. I mean, you know, he's playing good, obviously, just won the British Senior last week. And that was a demanding course there, too. There's a lot of golf left, here, a lot. And you start getting ahead of yourself -- I mean this is definitely a one shot at a time place. But they're all one shot at a time places.
