  Q. This being your first senior PGA how do you think it went?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: Did you look at my score? I shot 5-over or 6-over.   
  
  Q. What do you think was the biggest obstacle out there?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: I shot 6-over, you know, somebody shot 5-under or something, so obviously it wasn't the wind. I mean, I didn't play good.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: It's a nice place to play golf.   
  
  Q. Adjustments for tomorrow?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: Play better.   
  
  Q. What were your general thoughts on the course today?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR, III: I thought it was very playable, even though the wind is picking up in spots. I think they slowed the greens down a little bit so it's not, the ball's not getting away from us on the greens so much. And the scores are showing that. With low score being 6-under.
