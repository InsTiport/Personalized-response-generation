  THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, Tommy Armour III.   69, 1 under for the championship.  
   
 Q.   Had a good round?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Were you consistent getting on the fairway and coming down the greens?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   Pretty consistent.   You hit it in the rough, if you get a good lie, you're lucky.   I mean, I was pretty steady.   I hit‑‑ it was all right.   I probably hit probably eight, nine.  
   
 Q.   Were you supplied at all what some of those early scores were looking like with Kite and so forth now?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   No.  
   
 Q.   Why not?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   Because it's a course where, if you hit in the fairway, you can go.  
   
 Q.   Greens are soft enough?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   Greens are just how they should be for this tournament.   It's not the U.S. Open.   It's just Senior U.S. Open, and it's not supposed to be‑‑ it's tough enough out there.   You miss the fairways, and it's plenty tough.   But if you're going to get it in the fairways, you have a little bit of a reward and something to fire at.  
   
 Q.   How about your position?   You're not too far off.   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   There's a lot of golf left between my position and any position.  
   
 Q.   It was good to shoot under par in a USGA event?   
TOMMY ARMOUR III:   It's always good to shoot under par any day.   No, no matter what event it is; club, championship.   Thank you.
