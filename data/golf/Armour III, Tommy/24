Q.
Obviously last year coming in here and doing what you did last year, how does that help you, and is it also a weight to have so much success here last year?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  A what?
Q.  Is there any downside to doing so well here?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, there's no downside, no.
Q.  What's the upside?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  That you won.  I mean, there's no downside to winning I don't think.
Q.  But to win it in such overwhelming fashion?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, it's all good.
Q.  The course is --
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  The course is in great shape.  It's actually in better shape than it was last year.
Q.  Do you feel good coming in?  You've missed the cut in four of your last six.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yeah.
Q.  Is it good to get here where you've had so much success?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I've been working on some things in my swing.  We're always tinkering.
Q.  Is it good to come in where you've had so much success here?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Of course.
Q.  Given how the last few say half dozen tournaments or so have gone for you?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, in those I've missed the cut by a shot in two of them and two shots in the other two, and so, I mean, as you know, out here on Tour, that's not far from being good golf.  You can make the cut and win the tournament now on Tour.  It's just a little here and there.

That's not really that disappointing.  Yeah, it's disappointing I missed four cuts, but that's the way it is.
Q.  I'm sorry if you've been asked this, but what's the year been like from the time you won last year until now?  What's the year been like with just things going on, any different?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, it's been just a regular year for me.  I mean, nothing really --
Q.  No major changes?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, none.
Q.  In talking to several players out there, they talked about, you know, obviously what a great tournament you had last year.  Every time they watched you, you were making everything putting-wise as far as short or long.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I mean, when you watch guys win tournaments every week, that's what they do.
Q.  What was it like for you last year, though, getting on that kind of roll?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It was great (laughter).
Q.  Was there any in particular that sort of led to that last year?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Just always tweaking and tinkering, just kind of led to it, and I got a new putter like two weeks before the tournament, and it just felt good.
Q.  Did you get another new putter two weeks ago?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, I still have the same putter.
Q.  What kind was it again?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It's a TP Mills.
Q.  Did you have any idea what the '72 world record was at the time you were playing?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  You know, I didn't.  I thought I needed to par the last hole, and I bogeyed it.  I was like, God, that would have been nice to have the record.  I really didn't know what it was.

You know, I don't read much media and newspapers and stuff or record books and stuff like that, so I don't really -- I mean, they might have even have said it in the paper on Saturday in the edition for Sunday, but I didn't read it.
Q.  It seems like -- are you not comfortable in this setting as far as having to get in front of people and talk, dealing with the media?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, I'm fine with it.
Q.  Would you rather just sort of go out there and play?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, I mean, if you play good, that comes with playing good.
Q.  Any distractions this year as the defending champ?  Obviously there's a little bit more asked of you?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Well, there's a few more requirements, but it's a good problem.
Q.  One you wouldn't mind having again next year?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, I look forward to it.
Q.  What about the course this year, how does it look?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It's in great shape.  It's in as good a shape as last year.  I think better.  I think the greens might even be better.
Q.  I think the rough is up a little bit this year, isn't it?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  You know, a little bit, but it's not really a course you hit it in the rough that much.
Q.  We haven't had the rain like we did last year, two, three weeks before the tournament, so it might be a little faster.  The greens might be a little harder.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  It's not playing that fast right now, but I think it's going to because we're not going to have any more rain this week supposedly.
Q.  We brought our umbrellas to scare the rain off.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I think they're going to firm up a little bit more than last year.
Q.  Is your son going to be out here again this week?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No, he's not.  He started high school so he said he wasn't going to come this week.  He's going to wait for Disney.

I used to pull him out on Fridays and stuff and bring him to tournaments, but he's not going to do it.  He's going to save them all up for one week.
Q.  Are you superstitious at all?  Do you do anything?  Don't have any lucky socks, special meals?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Not really.  I'm not staying in the same hotel or any of that stuff.
Q.  You don't look particularly tense, either.
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  No.  I've always liked this tournament, though.  I've always enjoyed the Texas Open.
Q.  Is there anything in particular about La Cantera that suits your game?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I just have always played it fairly decent.  I don't know why.  I've always done all right here.
Q.  You hear a lot of players talking about how they like coming to San Antonio aside from the golf tournament.  What are some of the things that you enjoy about San Antonio outside of the golf?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I don't do much when I come here.  I just kind of hang out and go eat at Pappasito's a little bit.  I really don't do much in San Antonio.  I used to go down to the River one day during the week, but that's kind of --
Q.  Kind of far to go?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Right.  There's only so much you can do at the River Walk.  I've seen The Alamo and I've been to the Alamo Dome.  I've seen pretty much everything.  I am going to go see Sting and Annie Lennox on Friday night.
Q.  Which one of those two are you more looking forward to seeing?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Annie Lennox.
Q.  Any reason?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  I just like her better.
Q.  If you're leading after Friday are you still going to go?
TOMMY ARMOUR III:  Yeah.  I won't change anything.  I may get better because I'll sleep later on Saturday.
