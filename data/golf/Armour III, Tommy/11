  Q. What did you feel like you did right today?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: I shot 66. I hit the ball well. I made some putts. That's what you've got to do on this course. It's a good test of golf and I hit a lot of good shots. I played good and putted good.   
  
  Q. Next to Fred Funk, you've played in this tournament, the Kemper Open and Booz Allen more times than any other player; what keeps you coming back here?  
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: I like D.C., I like to play golf and those are the two things.  
  
  Q. Is there anything special about this area?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: No, I just like to come here. There's nothing particular. I like the area. I've always enjoyed coming here. Nothing in particular except I enjoy it.   
  
  Q. Two shots out right now. Talk about your thoughts going into tomorrow.   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Need to play good. That's my thought. Simple, you know. Play the first hole tomorrow and go from there.   
  
  Q. How much different did the course play today with all the rain?   
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: It was a little slower than it played the first two days. But I mean, I've played this course a lot, so I've even it in a lot of conditions, so I knew how it was going to play today. I played pretty good.   
  
  Q. How hard do you think --  
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Well, you know, the course is always -- I mean, if you don't hit the ball well, the course is hard. I drove it in the fairway a lot. Hit a lot of good iron shots and had good putts at birdies. You know, if you do that, no course is hard.   
 But if you don't hit the good shots, an easy course can play hard.   
  
  Q. Would you say this is average --  
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: Well, they hold the U.S. Open here, so I would say it's a pretty good course.  
  
  Q. As tough as this course has played --  
 TOMMY ARMOUR III: There wasn't much wind today and the greens were receptive and the fairways weren't running out too much. I mean, today was a good day to get it.
