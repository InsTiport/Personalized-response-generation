  SIR ALEX FERGUSON: Well, I've been excited all day, put it that way.  Standing on the first tee for every start was an unbelievable atmosphere.  The fans, it was spectacular, and they were great to the U.S. Team.  It was really, really fantastic camaraderie between both teams, very special.Q. You were called in by Captain McGinley to talk to both caddies and the team.  Give us insight into the sort of thing you were saying?SIR ALEX FERGUSON: Just general chat with them all.  I think I got more out than they did.  I thought it was fantastic to be in their company.Q. Golf has been incredible over the past three days.  How is it they can produce in these sort of performances?SIR ALEX FERGUSON: That's why they are playing today.  They are the best; both sides are the best players in their countries and the whole of Europe.  You saw the competition today.  It was so -- the margins were so small.  You have to say this was the most special type of golf you'll ever see.  Some of the putting was outstanding.  That's the measure of the quality of golfer we're watching today.
