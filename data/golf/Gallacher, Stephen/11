Q. Your assessment of that opening round, 2-under?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I'm actually a bit disappointed to be honest.  I only missed one fairway out there and three bogeys from the middle of the fairway, so I played lovely.  It's such a tough course.  I'm sure that will even itself out over the four days.
Q. You went out in 33.  Did that give you confidence going into the back nine?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, it did.  I played lovely.  Never really missed a shot to be honest.  Just you get half a club out with the wind and you can run-off a green or you hit it too far and you leave yourself not much of a chip.  It's a very demanding course.  You have to be on full, maximum concentration for the full 18 holes.
Q. How happy are you with your game at the moment?  How is it progressing?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, I've been playing good all year.  I've started to drive the ball really well.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to getting into the middle of the season.
Q. What's your game plan for tomorrow?  More of the same?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Absolutely.  Just pars are good.  Hit the fairways and try and hole some putts.
