  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The last five holes were tricky enough, so it was a chance there morning, and it's reflecting in the scores.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel pressure or expectation from home galleries?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not really, but you embrace it and enjoy it, really.   It's nice to play in front of your home fans.   You don't get to do it very often.   If you sort of can't thrive on it, there's something wrong with you.   
   
 Q.   If there is one secret to navigating your way around Castle Stuart on a day like this, what is it?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Can you tell me‑‑  
   
 Q.   Well, the secret to playing links golf.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   ‑‑ I might use it in the morning.   
   
 Q.   You tell me, please.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Just to get the ball in the hole, less shots than the other guys.   That's what every golf course is like.   
The par 5s, you can have eagles on them.   I hit 3‑wood, 8‑iron to the sixth and you're comfortable getting on in two on three of the four, so you've really got to take advantage of them.   
   
 Q.   How has your game been in general this season?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's been good.   It was good last week.   I had a bit of injury for about a month and I'm over that now, but playing nice.   I played lovely today.  
   
 Q.   You're going to The Open next week.   Do you concentrate fully on The Scottish Open, or do you have one eye on next week at Muirfield?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, it's hard not to, but you've got to try and concentrate as much as you can this week.   You know, The Open is there and you're playing it; it's brilliant, something you look forward to.   But one shot at a time here, the boring stuff, and just try to get the job done first.
