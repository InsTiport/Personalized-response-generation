  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Got off to a good start and birdied the first couple and birdied eight, so steamed at the bend and then had one and two at 10 and holed a few putts at the end, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   In sublime conditions it's pristine here, isn't it?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The course is in phenomenal condition.   The best ‑‑ I think I've been coming here for 14, 15 years.   I think it's getting better every year.  
   
 Q.   And though the rough might be up and penalizing if you're in it, you've got plenty of opportunities, and the greens are just perfect, aren't they?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.   It's a very fair golf course.   You've got to shape it a bit, and the greens are just phenomenal, great pace, true.   No excuses here.  
   
 Q.   I take it that you are in a good chipper mood anyway, particularly on the back of a hole‑in‑one yesterday?   You might just think, oh, this could be a good week?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   That was a nice bonus anyway.   My only other hole‑in‑one has been on this course as well.   So nice to win a car this time rather than just the honour.  
   
 Q.   Will you keep it?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I don't know yet.  
   
 Q.   Do you like it?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well‑‑  
   
 Q.   You can't say otherwise.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I'm actually sponsored by Audi, and it's a Mercedes.   So probably not.  
   
 Q.   Do you actually think, oh, this happened, and hey, this genuinely could be a kick start to something very special here?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's just a good part for me to build on.   It gives you a good impetus.   You're obviously hitting the ball pretty good if you're holing it, so if you can just keep your confidence up.  
   
 Q.   Is this a progression in recent weeks feeling that you're getting better?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I was a bit rough last week, to be honest.   My driver broke right off in that round.   So that kind of scuppered my plans a bit last week.   I played not too bad in Abu Dhabi, finished mid 30s.   
So yeah, it was frustrating.   I've played since first week in December, so I'm getting a bit more used to it, back in the swing of it.  
   
 Q.   Good place to shake off the rust, isn't it?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Wow, it's perfect.  
   
 Q.   And that driver, the new one in the bag, it's done well?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's not perfect, but it's getting there.
