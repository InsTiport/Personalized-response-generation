Q. Give us your thoughts on a split round.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah it was quite tricky this morning.  It was raining and cold and kind of ball wasn't going very far.  So it was tough to kind of -- six holes to go, standing on one of the toughest holes to go, I three-putted it.  I hit two lovely shots.
It's quite tough when you come in the in the morning and you have to warm up in the dark and whatnot, but I'm delighted I got it back a couple holes later and just played pretty solid.  Looking forward to this afternoon.
Q. Is that the key when you come six holes remaining, and just kind of making sure you don't lose any?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   They are quite tough pins to be honest.  They were all hanging.  You're playing just a little bit away from them.  It's tough to get close to be honest.  On the last it's playing really long.
Yeah, it was just -- it was quite tricky.  I would take par.  One of those ones that keeps you in it and got a chance going into the next couple days.
Q. The birdie on 15?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Hit a lovely 9-iron about 20-foot.  Just the pin is tucked so far right and I holed the putt and that was it.  The other one was two-putting from 30 foot.
Q. Nice position?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, looking forward to it.  Played with Dustin before.  So looking forward to play with him.  That will be nice to see.  Always good to play with the world's best, see what they are doing.
