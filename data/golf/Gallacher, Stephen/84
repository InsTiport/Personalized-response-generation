Q.   Your thoughts on round two, please?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, it was a lot trickier with the wind, the conditions.   The greens were firming up at the end but delighted to be still in the hunt for going into the weekend.

Q.   Better than just in the hunt, isn't it?   It's a very solid performance. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, the wind was switching all over the shop.   It was hard to club.   Going in one behind is a the place you want to be really. 

Q.   Was that evident right from the start?   We've certainly seen the temperatures drop and the wind swirl. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The wind switched 360 about six holes out which was tough to sort of‑‑ it's hard to trust it and see how to get it pin‑high again.   It was a tricky day.   It was dull; had a few spots of rain, and total opposite of rain. 

Q.   You've seen all sort of conditions here, I guess?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I've never seen rain here, anyway.

Q.   What are your thoughts at the halfway stage?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   You just want to be in the hunt for Sunday, have a good one tomorrow and then see what happens come Sunday afternoon.

Q.   You're so experienced, does it matter that you draw on anything from last year or any other great successes? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, it's just a course.   I know the course pretty well.   It was tough today.   We got sort of weird winds that I had never played before, so just go out and play the course and see what happens.

Q.   Any indication of what a winning score might be? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Haven't got a clue.   If it stays like that, I think it will be maybe mid to late teens, same as it always is.
