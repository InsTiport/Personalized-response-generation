 Q.   You did hole some good putts towards the end.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   That's what you need to do, isn't it.   Probably least I was only 3‑under today but it was tougher conditions, tougher pins.   It was just a three‑hour walk.   
   
 Q.   You beat a player who has been playing well, as well?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, he could go on and win it but that's the kind of format.   Only two gone through out of four.   It's a tough group.   
   
 Q.   You said you were tired but a week off before you go to China?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I'm going to up to Aviemore Sunday night with the family.   Not take my clubs‑‑ well, I might take a couple.   
   
 Q.   Have you got to the level now where every week seems to be a big week?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's terrible, isn't it.   
   
 Q.   It's what you aim for, but‑‑  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, it's brilliant.   It's a good thing.   Highs of lows of the season, still have five massive tournaments to play.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you need a break?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I feel I just need to work a wee bit on my game, just a slight wee bit.   I'm not far away.   I came here working on something anyway and just keep chipping away and see what happens for the last four, last five.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what area of the game you are actually working on specifically?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Just working on everything, trying to get my bad shot better, basically.   You get your bad shot better, you're in the game all the time.   
Four big ones to end the season, World Ranking and start the season in December in Sun City.   Never played that.   Heard the course is brilliant so really looking forward to that.
