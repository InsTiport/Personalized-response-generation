 Q.  How were conditions?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It was tough.  Tough putting, really.  The wind was moving the putts on the greens, so you would aim for it one time and do it the next and it would move.  It was just really tough to get the ball close, as well.  Anything under par is a great score this afternoon.   
 Q.  You've played this course in many conditions.  How does that compare to previous years?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I'd say that's one of the toughest rounds I've played.  I hit irons into holes I've never hit anywhere near before.  It's always a tough wind here, straight across the course.  So it's never into you or down.  It's always right across.  So it's a tough wind.   
 Q.  Talk me through some of the strengths of your play today.  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I hit quite a lot of greens, which is what you've got to do.  I hit my irons good.  Just hit a few -- struggled to get it close enough, hitting the long irons crosswind, so you're hitting it to 30, 40 foot a lot.  But all in all, I'm happy.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts going into the next three days?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, you hear all sorts about tomorrow.  It's going to be 35-mile-an-hour from the get-go.  So you know today and tomorrow is just try as hard as you can to get into the red numbers and be up there for the weekend when it calms down.
