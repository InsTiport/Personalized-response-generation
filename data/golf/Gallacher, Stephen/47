  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, yesterday was quite tough.   It was kind of tough to get going and hard to get my head around it but today was a lot better.   Played nicely today and looking forward to next week now.  
   
 Q.   And the reason why yesterday didn't work out and today is better?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   That's life.   I don't know really.   I struggled a bit yesterday, maybe trying a wee bit too hard.   You know, I was thinking‑‑ still thinking about next week to be honest.   But today was a lot better.   Just sort of my routine was better today, stuck to that, hit the shots where I was aiming and that was it so nothing could get in my head really, apart from that.  
   
 Q.   Presumably that's a huge positive?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, definitely.   Yesterday is the first time you're coming down and you're looking so much forward to next week, there's a bit of pressure on you, getting in The Ryder Cup, more commitments and stuff.   So going to take me a wee bit to get used to.   But today was just back to normal.   If I hole a few putts today, I shoot 4‑ or 5‑under.   
   
 Q.   The game itself, techniques, technicalities, still fine?   Because you've been in good shape.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Absolutely.   Yesterday was nothing to do with technique or anything like that.   I feel good.   I'm physically good and mentally good and really looking forward to next week now.  
   
 Q.   What is the plan from here on?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Go up the road just now and maybe play nine holes with Thomas on Monday morning, do a bit of practice, do a bit of chill out, relax and get ready for a long week.
