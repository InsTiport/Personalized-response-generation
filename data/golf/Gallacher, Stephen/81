 Q.   Thoughts on winning?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well I'm glad it's over anyway.   It was a tough day today, really, really tough, hard to get the ball close with the wind gusting but nice to get over the line and in.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through that eagle.   That was the fifth of the week?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   These days you need to do something special to win out here.   Just a perfect number, came in perfect, and if it wasn't, then it's close.   I've had the breaks this week and that's what you need to win.  
   
 Q.   Been a long while, hasn't it?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, eight years.   But just maturing with age hopefully.   
   
 Q.   In that time, you've come mightily close on many occasions, there might have been 20‑plus Top‑10 finishes, so did you ever think, come on, it's got to happen?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.   Well, you know, I've said at the top of the year, to get into the Top‑50.   I've practiced hard and got my equipment right and stuff like that.   But no, it's been tough.   I've had chances and there's always been somebody that's just done one better than me.   But I got it well this week.  
   
 Q.   Proud of yourself, getting it done in almost a match‑play situation?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I am, actually.   
   
 Q.   How will you celebrate?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I've got a 7.00 Emirates flight in the morning, so I might be a bit rough on that.
