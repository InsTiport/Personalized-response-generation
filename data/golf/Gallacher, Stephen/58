Q.   Anything under par today is really good. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I'm a wee bit disappointed.   The wind was picking up, so I'm happy with that.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's a special place, one in a million places.   Just it's hard to sort of just get that out of the way and just concentrate on the golf. 
At the end of the day it's I golf tournament, so you've got to be trying to play the course.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I would say that was, to be, honest.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I never really had a shot.   Apart from that it was a solid, solid round.

Q.   What do you think, five or six first timers like yourself under par, why do you think that is?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Maybe no bad memories (laughter).

Q.   (Inaudible.)   How did you feel on the first pin?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I felt I should take it.   Just like you would any other day.   If you don't have that, you're in the wrong game.

Q.   The way you played the first three holes, it must have given you confidence, because you found the fairway and then found the green, and from there you just went on?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I hit it good all day.   I just played for position.   When I had it in position I tried to hit it.   And even on 11 I was just on the right, I just didn't get it up and down. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER :   Well, the winds are getting up and the greens are getting firmer. 

Q.   Did you see your name second on the leaderboard?
STEPHEN GALLACHER :   No.

Q.   You said the best part of your game is your iron play?
STEPHEN GALLACHER :   You go for certain positions to leave yourself a putt.
