  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It was one of those rounds where I thought I was going to have 18‑‑ but it was nice to birdie 17. 

Q.   What's the story behind that?   How come you've managed, through consistency or scrambling? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I hit greens in regulation, so I had pretty much 35 putts.   Some were close.   Some were good two putts from distance.   So it was about even really.

Q.   Do you walk off a hole disappointed or frustrated?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, if you walk off and the worst you get is a par you're pretty happy I think.

Q.   Well, not everybody. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, you are in this wind. 

Q.   Do you feel you're missing your chances‑‑
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   You are in this wind‑‑ you have to be patient, especially when it's gusting.   It was gusting on the back nine.   Playing tough. 

Q.   Yesterday the wind was picking up in the afternoon, how much difference is there between the two rounds?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it was a lot tougher.   You know, a lot of pins today were quite tricky with the opposite wind, so it was tough to get it close.   It was gusting a wee bit again and tough to get it pin‑high.   So par is a good score out there.

Q.   Give us an example of how clubbing was different over the two days. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   We only got nine holes yesterday that were quite calm and then pretty much played 27 holes the exact same. 

Q.   What are your thoughts into the weekend and the position you find yourself? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Just keep playing the way I'm playing and see what happens. 
Lying second going into the third round, you're doing all right.
