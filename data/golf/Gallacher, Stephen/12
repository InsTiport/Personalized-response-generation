 Q.  First competitive round of 2019, how did that feel out there?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It was great, yeah.  Played lovely the front nine.  Gave myself a chance.  Got to 4-under.  Only missed one green of the was never really outside 15-, 20-foot.  Holed a few putts.  Didn't really play that great on the back nine, but you know, 4-under is pretty good since the first of November.   
 Q.  4-under, you must be pleased.  What pleased you most with your game out there?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Hit my irons pretty good.  Rolled the ball well.  Didn't really hit as many fairways as I wanted.  Still a wee bit of rust in there but gives me something to build on for the weekend.   
 Q.  You've had success in the desert before, your last two wins coming in Dubai.  What is it about the desert?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I wish I knew so I could use it somewhere else.  I just think, sort of a little bit of wind, you can see the ball going a bit lower in the ground a bit more like what you do in Scotland.   It's a great place to come and play golf.  The courses are excellent, as well.  I feel very comfortable playing out here.   
 Q.  Any changes over the years?  Is it playing differently to prior seasons?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I just think it's a great golf course.  You can get punished if you don't hit your drives well.  If you hit the fairways, there's a chance you can be a bit more aggressive at the flags.  I think it's just in fantastic condition.  Just a great way to start the tournament.   
 Q.  What are you going to work on now heading into tomorrow's round?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I'm going to hit some drives later on.  I didn't drive it as well as I wanted to.  After I get my lunch, I'm going to hit some drives.
