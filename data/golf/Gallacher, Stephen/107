  Q. Conditions out there?  
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: A lot tougher than the other days, the wind was swirling about which never makes it easy. The flags were also on the front or on the backs of the greens which made them hard to get close to. But I am delighted because I played well today and only hit a couple of bad shots all day which cost me the two bogeys. But I am only two behind and in the hunt on Sunday which is all we can ever ask for.  
  
  Q. Does it suit you to be coming in under the radar a bit out with all the other Ryder Cup stuff?  
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: I'd rather be five ahead! But these guys are professional enough not to think about the Ryder Cup tomorrow, they'll be trying to think about winning this event first and foremost. Trying to beat the Molinaris is tough every week because they are great players, top 20 in the world. It is a good field this week and we will just have to see what happens tomorrow.  
  
  Q. I think you said a win was all that was missing for you from this season - you have a right good chance now?  
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well I am trying to win every week, that's how hard it is. Just ask Francesco Molinari how hard it is to win. You need a lot of things to go your way, obviously you need to play well but you need a bit of luck and a bit of a rub of the green. You try and get into contention on Sunday as often as you can and if it goes your way the last round, it goes your way.  
  
  Q. It is astonishing that the two Molinaris are in the last group again here in Scotland, just like they were at Loch Lomond?  
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, what a nightmare eh! (laughter). I played with Edoardo in the first two rounds there too. But they are great players.
