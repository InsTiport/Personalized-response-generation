Q.   6‑under today, how pleased are you with today's round? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I'm delighted to get off to a good start.   You can't win it today but you can put yourself in position, especially with Rory shot 9‑under, so hanging in. 
You want to get off to a good start and then hopefully build on it.   I think the weather is supposed to be inclement on the weekend so want to try and stay as close to Rory as I can.

Q.   Playing with Rory and Tiger, you seem to enjoy very much playing together.   Did this give you special motivation playing together with two guys scoring well? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it sort of brings you along.   The weather was pretty good today, the course was in perfect condition, so you have to really take advantage of getting the weather, the elements right.   

Q.   You mentioned the perfect conditions.   There are so many low scores; a surprise to you?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, when you get greens as good as this, the weather, no wind, it's pretty decent scoring. 

Q.   Anything you have to adjust for tomorrow or just keep it going?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, just keep going, play my own game and just try to stay as close to Rory and Tiger as I can.
