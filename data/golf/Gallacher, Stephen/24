STEPHEN GALLACHER: It's been great.  Andriy, he's a top player, plays off scratch.  He's sort of one of those enviable guys that's good at everything.   
 Q.  Are you learning from him then?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Sometimes.  No, we get on well, it's great to play with someone in this who is a good player, a really good top player.  It's just tough when you play courses like this and there's no strokes and stuff like that.  It was a beast today, and to shoot a couple under, we're happy with that.  Hopefully we can go low tomorrow.   
 Q.  Conditions seem perfect but the wind was up a bit this morning.  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It was about a three- or four-club wind when we started.  Same when we finished.  It was a tough day.   
 Q.  How are you enjoying life here at the Dunhill?  
ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO: It's fantastic.  The weather is beautiful.  It's such a nice tournament.  I can't imagine better partner.  He's just very nice player, great guy, great player, and we have beautiful nice two days and looking forward for tomorrow.   
 Q.  What have you learned from this man over the last 36 holes?  
ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO: Golf, you always have to believe, it's never finished, like 18 today, unbelievable.   
 Q.  How serious do you take your golf?  
ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO: I try to play reasonably like five, four times in a week.   
 Q.  That's pretty serious.  
ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO: I'm living in Wentworth playing a little there and my kids also interested in the golf.  It's a great game.   
 Q.  When you walk around the golf course with Stephen, I know he's a football fan attic, as well, big Celtic fan --  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I was friendly with him until he told me he scored at park head and beat Celtic 2-1 for Milan.   
 Q.  Is it chat of football or golf?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: A bit of both.  It's nice to hear his stories.  We talk about golf, talk about football.  All footballers want to play golf and all golfers want to be footballers.  That's the theme.   
 Q.  The serious side of this, a huge pot of money up for grabs and lots of Ryder Cup points and you're bang in the mix, aren't you.  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: This is one of the places if you come here, you shoot 72 or better, you're quite happy.  When you see the scores at Kingsbarns and St. Andrews, if you're playing well, you can shoot 5-, 6-, 7-under.  I have a round tomorrow at Kingsbarns and then another round at St. Andrews, where who knows what can happen.   
 Q.  It's been an up-and-down season for you.  Do you feel your game is coming back?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Sometimes.  It's better than it's been for a while.  Still got the odd bad shot but we all hit them.  It's just how you deal with it.
