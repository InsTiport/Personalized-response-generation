Q.   First there has been some changes in this tournament over the venue and very different playing conditions to what we are used to. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, early in the year‑‑ the course is perfect, really.   The changes‑‑ well, it's the same course really.   A few new tees, very good. 

Q.   Coming off the round, what do you think the scores will be like?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, if the weather stays like this, I think it will be sort of a bunch under par.   It's good if you're playing well, but if you're playing poor, the rough is very thick, it can be tricky. 

Q.   What will you do now?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Rest. 

Q.   How was that today? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, that was good.   Course was very sort of‑‑ you can't get any better than first out.   The greens are getting soft and a wee bit chewed up after the rain yesterday on the back nine, but overall the course is immaculate. 
This week, it's kind of‑‑ sort of the first cut is okay, but if you miss the sort of general fairway, it's knee‑high.   Got to keep out of that stuff.

Q.   Did you keep out of it?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I did thankfully.

Q.   What's the experience if you're in there? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Hope I'm not in it. 

Q.   But plenty of opportunities into the greens? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I missed a 10‑footer for eagle and missed a couple of putts around six‑foot.   So could have been a low one but pleased with the start.

Q.   Perfect conditions for the first morning. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, gorgeous.   The course is great.

Q.   What's the highlight out there for you today? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I hit the ball really well, pin‑high a lot, which if you can do that, keep it going for the week, you're going to have a lot of chance.

Q.   Right from the start you felt it was going to be a decent day? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I did actually.   I hit the ball good in practise.   I hit the ball good on Tuesday and I holed a few putts, as well, which is nice.   Delighted with it. 

Q.   How about the year, an excellent finish with those two second‑place finishes, but not a lot of late; a reason for that?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not played a lot.   I missed a couple of cuts just by a shot.   Wasn't really driving the ball that well but I feel my game is pretty good now. 

Q.   Plenty of practise and time at home working on things? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I've been working hard and it's paying off.
