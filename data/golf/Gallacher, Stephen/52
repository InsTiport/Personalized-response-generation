Q.   You're hitting pretty well yesterday afternoon.   You've played really well to get here?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, not too bad, actually.   Totally different course today.   The wind was the opposite direction, so it was enough to get your attention, but yeah, I'm delighted to be under par.

Q.   Do you think it will be enough to be here on the weekend?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I hope so.   It was my best I could have done, so that's what I've got.   And I think the Back 9 is playing really tough now, so should be fine.

Q.   Two contrasting rounds.   When you got up this morning, did you know that you had to almost change things from yesterday?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not really, no.   Just done the same thing.   There's only three or four holes in the middle of my round that just sort of knocked it out.

Q.   Silly question to finish, but then you expect nothing else from me.   When you're in the position you are now, can you almost relax going into the weekend?   You can almost play care‑free golf?   You know that you're there.   You know that a couple of good 66s might see you in contention. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   You're right.   It was a silly question.

Q.   Do you care to answer it?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I wish I had a crystal ball.

Q.   So do I, Steve, trust me.   But you know what I mean?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not really, no.

Q.   Well, you are.   Nobody's looking at you.   There's no pressure on you.   You can come back here tomorrow and almost relax?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I'll just come back and do the same again.   You know, I'll need to obviously, depending on how far I'm back.   Maybe I'll look at the game plan.   If that's what you mean.

Q.   That's what I meant.   It was a different golf course today in terms of wind direction.   How did you handle that?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, well, it's tough, so you had to sort of adjust, but it's obviously the total opposite from yesterday.   I guess that's the beauty of links golf.   One day it's a driver and a wedge.   Next day it's a driver, 3‑wood 5‑iron.   So you've just got to adapt, change mid round.

Q.   And obviously happy to get yourself under par?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.   Got myself under par.   That was the key, try and get as low as I could.   You know, links golf can change.   The weather could come in.   So as long as I'm not too far away going into the weekend, hopefully.   You never know.

Q.   Do you feel the level of support behind you?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.   Great support today, and yesterday.   It's been great.   Fantastic event.   I think the sunshine helps, brings a few more through the gates.

Q.   Do you sense the wind changing?   Is it going to get tougher potentially as the afternoon wears on?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, the minute you tell them, sort of from the ninth every hole is into the wind.   Yesterday it was get to the ninth and then every hole was downwind, so you've gotta make your score on the Front 9.   There's not many chances on the Back 9.

Q.   And are you feeling positive about the weekend?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.   Hopefully if it's enough to get there, I'm feeling good.
