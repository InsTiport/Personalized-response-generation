   STEPHEN GALLACHER: I got off to a poor start, doubled the third hole and then dug deep and stayed patient. It was a battle but I finished well and had some chances coming in. 1-under is great, any time you finish 1-under in a major is great. 
 I got here at 5:45, had my breakfast and went out. Even though it was foggy you have to prepare as it could lift so quickly. So I did my warmup and then it just came right in. Back in, another breakfast, back out for some chipping, back in for another breakfast of some toast and fruit, back out in earnest. Teed off and there was a slight delay and it never really picked up. I didn't see the ball land until the fifth hole.
 This is a great venue, brilliant setting and very picturesque. And if I have four rounds under par, I will be happy at the end of the week.
