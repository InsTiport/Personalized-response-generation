 Q.   Your verdict on the first day around a tough course like this?   
STEPHEN GALLAGHER:   Well, I would have took 3‑under going out.   Just a wee bit disappointed.   Finished a bit poorly but apart from that, delighted.  
   
 Q.   It is a test, isn't it?   
STEPHEN GALLAGHER:   One of the best courses in the world.   Just can't take your eye off the ball at all.   Just a fantastic golf course, and demanding.   Every single hole is demanding, and it's good to be under par.  
   
 Q.   What makes it one of the best in the world from your eye?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The layout is right, the condition, the setup.   There's no negatives at all.  
   
 Q.   And you got it going very early on with five birdies in seven holes.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I started great.   Played great all day to be honest.   Just hit two poor shots in the end.   Played good, played nice.   Hit a lot of good shots on the right side of the flags and distance control was brilliant today and gave myself lots of chances, so looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   And that was the whole mark at the start, distance control, give yourself an opportunity on the greens.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Gave myself chances and holed a few putts.   It was pretty easy to be honest.   The front nine it was stress‑free.   Got a wee bit unlucky a few times the back nine but apart from that it was great.  
   
 Q.   How are you?   I heard there were back and shoulder problems recently.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I've had a sore back for a month.   I was off for a month there.   Still have to get physio before I go out and just watch what I'm doing afterwards, but now I'm pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Is that a flare‑up of the old problems that you've had?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, I think I'm just getting old to be honest.  
   
 Q.   So you have to look after yourself like we all do?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Exactly.  
   
 Q.   Does that involve loads of physio?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, just a bit of physio and look after myself.
