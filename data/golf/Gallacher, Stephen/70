Q.   Winning always special, a little extra satisfaction to go out first and beat such a formidable pair? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, that was nice.   Obviously a little bit more pressure when you're going out there first to get the tournament started.   You want to get out there and play some nice golf and get a point on the board which we managed to do. 
So we both combined very well today.   It was great fun playing with Stevie.

Q.   Your first experience of Seve Trophy.   How was it?   Did it compare to expectation? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it was great.   To be honest it was good having Paul who is experienced in the game more than me.   Nice being the in youngster in the fourâ€‘ball, as well.   It was good. 
Obviously my first time, so a wee bit nervous and looking forward to it but great to get off with a win.

Q.   Got to ask you about your second shot to 7, our commentators thought it was an exceptional shot off the fairway. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, luckily I have got a lofted driver which kind of helps; mine is about 11 degrees.   Yeah, we had a perfect yardage there.   I thought I could just about get it on the front of the green and hit it pretty flush, so it went up there quite close.   It was nice.
