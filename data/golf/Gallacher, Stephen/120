Q.  What did you think?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I played better than that.  I made some mistakes in the middle of the fairways.  I struggled a bit on hitting soft shots.  It's the first time I've actually played with a sore back.  I guess the back is the way you're used to swinging.  I drove the ball so much better.
Q.  You played last week, as well?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I had to swing better.  I have to swing when I can, so it's just a case of going back to the swings I used to do.
Q.  Obviously you could swing a bit more freely.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yes.
Q.  You're getting used to this, these two big weeks?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yeah, just a bit disappointed at the bad finish.
Q.  The good thing is that you will get four rounds here.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yeah, that's right.
Q.  You can pick up where you left off, in good position anyway.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yeah.
