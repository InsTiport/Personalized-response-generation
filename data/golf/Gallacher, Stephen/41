Q. A tough match, and in the end, it just went the wrong way for you.STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, it was a good match.  Getting a couple down and then hitting a few back at the end ^  felt I holed a good putt at 12 which kind of swung the momentum, maybe kept it level and then when he birdied 15, 16, it was kind of an uphill struggle for me from there.Q. It's the end now of your Ryder Cup, have you enjoyed it?STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, and there's one in two years' time, isn't there, hopefully I'll be back at that one.Q. You'll be up for that one?STEPHEN GALLACHER: I will be, yeah.
