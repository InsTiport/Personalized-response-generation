 Q. The putt at the last --
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, I knew I had to hole it. To be honest, I thought I holed that putt last year to make the cut. So I knew the exact line. It was almost one of those ones I knew I was going to hole it funny enough. 
 Yeah, I played good today. I think I just started too far behind the guys. But I needed a good one to try to get into America, so hopefully that's good enough. 

 Q. Should get you in. 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Hopefully.

 Q. What was the length of the putt? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: About a 35-footer. 

 Q. Putts the seal on what was a very good week. 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yes, tee-to-green, I played great. So a great way to finish. 

 Q. So you would go into America with a bit of confidence. 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, no reason why not.

 Q. You're now knocking on the door of a win, aren't you?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: It was a good week, I played really solid.
