Q. 4 under par 67 to finish the championship, you must be very pleased?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, bogey free is always nice.  Just a shame that shot at the last but I had a good chance at birdie there.  Overall, I think I had three rounds with no bogeys, so it's encouraging.
Q. 10 under par as it stands, we've still got Scott Jamieson, Marc Warren on the course, but you are the leading Scot.  How does that feel to come into the British Masters being the leading Scot?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: First of all, it's been a wonderful tournament.  It's been put on fantastically.  The course is great.  Spectators have been immense.  I hope the other Scots finish well, as well.  There's a lot of different agendas on the go, so yeah, all in all, I'm delighted.
Q. Could this be an important springboard for you starting the week roundabout 140 in The Race to Dubai?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: To be honest I'm not really    I'm just trying to get the last five weeks out injury free.  I'm not even thinking about it.  Last week I started to play well and I carried it on this week.  Take on Portugal and see what happens and start again in December.
Q. You probably don't want to think about it because it's a couple weeks away, but early birthday present?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, you kind of forget your birth days when you're in your 40s.  I'm 42 next couple weeks, so, yeah, it would be nice to have a bit of time off with the family.
