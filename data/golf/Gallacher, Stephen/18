 Q.  Good round today, what's the difference out there?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It was a bit softer today, so I could attack the pins a bit more.   
 Q.  You're 119 on the Order of Merit.  That in the back of your mind?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: No, just trying to do as well as I can in the tournament, post a couple of really low rounds at the weekend and see what happens.   
 Q.  Obviously the leaders are not finishes yesterday but a good round today puts you in a good position.  Is this a course that you like to chase on?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It's a course I like playing.  I finished Top-10 the last three times I've played it for some reason.  Must suit my eye.  I'm going to be a bit back.  They have still got nine holes to go and just again, it's the same as tomorrow, just the same as today.  Just go out and post as low a score as I can and see what happens.   
I'm playing well, so looking forward to it.
