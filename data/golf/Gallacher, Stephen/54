 Q.   Some incredible iron play early in the round.   Talk us through how good your swung felt in that early part of the round.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Struggled a bit the last couple of weeks, too, so been doing a lot of hard work and so free flowing and not thinking too much about it, just go to my target.   I hit pretty much most of my targets today which is all you can do really.  
   
 Q.   You've got five huge tournaments in the next six weeks which will probably resolve your Ryder Cup situation.   How do you view this run?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's a massive run, five tournaments, and the thing I've got to try and do is just play my golf and not think about it really.   So that's what I'm trying to do.   
This morning, the greens were a bit softer and it was there to be had.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about the course?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The course is good.   It's as good as I've ever seen it.   It's a great golf course and hopefully the weather stays like this for four days.
