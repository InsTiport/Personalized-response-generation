  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Being blustery, it's tough to get the club right, so anything under 70 is a good score today.  
   
 Q.   We could see that it's not very easy today, it's gusty, windy, rough is incredibly high.   How tough is it playing?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Two shots tougher probably than normal.   I've never played here with wind before, so it's bizarre.   It's swirling, as well.   It's tricky.   You can't take your aye off the ball for one minute.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about the year?   You've had some good results throughout the year; how has the year been?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it's been pretty good.   A couple of seconds and trying to get into the Topâ€‘30 to get into The Open this week.   A good one this week and a good one next week, and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Sounds motivating for going out tomorrow?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, definitely.
