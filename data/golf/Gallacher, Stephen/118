Q. Overall a good round?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I played great today, just one bad hole.
Q. What happened at 17?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  It's probably playing like a par five today. There won't be many guys up in two, to be honest. It was a drive and a three wood. I hit my second in the rough. You have got to hit it up the rough left - everybody will be in there as well because of the bunkers. My ball caught the bunker coming in. It was a good enough shot but it just hit the face. If it had missed the bunker it was on the middle of the green. I had a hit at it and it flew back in. Then I hit it out and had two putts for a six.
Q. So you had two shots in the bunker?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yes, I just kept it in. The same as what happened to me on the 16th at St Andrews yesterday.
Q. That must be your best round for a while?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yes. I just played solid and gave myself chances and holed the putts.
Q. Were you worried about missing the cut
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  You don't want to miss the cut when you are defending. I came out thinking I needed to shoot five under to make the cut, so I'm pleased with that but just a bit disappointed. I got a wee bit tired at the end but held on. It's tough when you turn back into the wind. You play 14, 15, 16 and 17 straight into the wind. I hung in well apart from the 17th.
Q. That's your best round since when?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Probably the Deutsche Bank when I finished third. My back is getting that wee bit better so I can start to hit some better shots.
