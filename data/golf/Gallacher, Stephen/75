Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I just can't believe the difference
the course can go from Wednesday to Thursday to Friday.  It's
unbelievable.  The greens went from 15 on a Stimp to about 9
overnight.  I don't know how they do it.  That's the course,
probably at its best.  The greens are perfect.  They're nice.
They're holding.  Well, they're holding enough.  And they're
putting at a decent pace.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I had a putt straight downwind, where
yesterday you would be doing well to get it four foot past.
Q.  You had a solid round.  You have a chance to make the
cut.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yeah, I played really well.  I hit
most all the fairways that you need to and then got up and down
when I needed to, as well.
Q.  On 9?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  I hit it just -- got a flier, and I
hit the wall and came back on the green and I holed for a
30-footer.  So you always keep it below the wall height
(laughter).
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Totally different wind yesterday from
today.
Q.  From the start?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  On 15 I had a driver and a 5-iron.
And I had a 5-iron, wedge today.  So it's absolutely -- 17 was
driver, 3-iron, wedge, so it's actually the toughest wind for the
course.  The par-3s and the 5s.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Well, that's it.  My only bogey, I
hit two cranking shots up into 5, into the bunker, and I couldn't
get a stance.  One of the one of the cartoon things that you see
the guy (indicating).  Hopefully my luck is changing.
Q.  It's not inconceivable that by the end of the day you
could be --
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Well, yeah, you need the cut.  It
depends on what the wind does.  If the greens dry out, the same as
we got yesterday.  15 was smelly, that was getting a bit -- that
landed five yards short, stopped dead.  Harris landed five yards
ran it around through the back with a wedge.  There's a couple of
them like that.
But on the whole it's tough.  It's tough out there.  The
par-3s are really long compared to yesterday.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Yeah, well, I didn't play that -- I
didn't think I played that bad yesterday and shot 5-over.  I
missed the fairway a couple of times.  A couple of times straight
at the flags.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  If you can't enjoy that, something is
wrong.  The grandstands are full and the sunshine.
Q.  What are you going to do today?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:  Get in a chair, feet up.
