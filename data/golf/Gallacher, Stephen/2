  Q. A bit of a shaky start with a bogey, and then you rallied.
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I keep fighting to second, took a bit of a shot there.
 Q. On second?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   On the second, yeah.  And then hit it close at the next, birdied that, got me back, and then two putt for a bump in, had a few chances there, so I was quite happy.
 Q. Parred out --
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, yeah, parred out, yeah.
 Q. How did you set yourself out, it's nice to take on the lead --
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I had a good shot to the par-3, I hit it to about 4 foot and then holed it.  So (indiscernible) bogey straightaway.
 Q. And were you nervous having had such a great round yesterday?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Oh, not really.  No, you just want to go out today and try and just shoot as well as you could.
 Q. And you said yesterday how much you love the course.
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it's a good course.
 Q. What is it particularly that --
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I don't know, it's just a good layout, it's in good condition.  It's testing.  You know, in the afternoon, it can get quite tricky.  So it's just one that you know it's a good test.
 Q. Is this your third time here?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Third time, yes.
 Q. So you know it pretty well?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.
 Q. What hole did you finish on there?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   On the 13th tee.
 Q. On the 13th tee.
 STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah.
 Q. Okay.  Perfect.  That's perfect.  Good luck.
