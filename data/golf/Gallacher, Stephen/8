STEPHEN GALLACHER: Carnoustie, I quite like it.  It's one of my favorite courses but it's never easy.   
 Q.  Marginally better than yesterday?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Obviously some tough holes but it wasn't add bad.  Maybe a couple of club wind at the most.   
 Q.  You must feel happy with where you're sitting going out on the weekend?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: You can never really tell.  You see guys shooting 7-, 8-unders and stuff like that.  Certainly wasn't on here or where I was at yesterday.  The Old Course, you can shoot it around there.  You can give it a good go around the Old Course if you get it going.  At least I'm playing there tomorrow and Sunday, so you get a feel for the place.   
 Q.  Perhaps not the year you would have liked but do you get a sense that things are coming together now?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, I've been playing good the last two or three months to be honest, two months.  Just not really been holing enough putts at the right time, that's all.  I've been making a lot of cuts.  Just not really getting as high up as I want.   
 Q.  That sense now that things are starting to pull in the right direction?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I don't know.  I've been playing all right.  You just need to sort of score a wee bit better, you know.  Hopefully I can do that over the weekend.
