  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   That's what I needed to do after having 3‑over the first round, I said I needed three really low ones, so just in position, and just hope that no one really runs away with it.  
   
 Q.   Was there a moment there where you thought, this is building into a very nice, tidy round?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I said to my caddie on 14, we need a strong finish.   I birdied four of the last five; that was pretty good.   But no, I definitely needed to get as high up as I could.  
   
 Q.   You couldn't look at a better finish and 17 was a lovely bonus wasn't it?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, chipped in pin‑high just off the side of the green and then up‑and‑downed at the last.   Wee bit of a fright with a 360, but yeah, on the whole I'm pleased.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of the final hole; it's changed considerably since the first time you've played here?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I think it's a better hole.   It's going to be more exciting anyway.   Tougher green, short hole; so everyone in the field can reach the green now.   It's just accuracy with the second shot is paramount.  
   
 Q.   Seems like one of those with a wealth of possible out comments?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's been tailor‑made for The Ryder Cup, so if you don't make it good for the crowd, there's something wrong.   
   
 Q.   And the drainage system, you've seen the changes there?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   The course is wet and the greens are perfect, so I'm all for that.  
   
 Q.   With all the focus on Paul Lawrie very much this week and Nicolas Colsaerts with The Ryder Cup, do you feel you're slightly under the radar and chance to win again on home soil?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I think the focus is on The Ryder Cup.   You know, it's the last counting event, so just try to do your best and get on with it.  
   
 Q.   You've always had an affinity with this track and this tournament, haven't you?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I like the whisky, so it would be nice to win it again, a nice bottle of it again, you know.
