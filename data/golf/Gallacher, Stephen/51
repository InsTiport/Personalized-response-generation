Q.   Played as well as you have today in this championship; how have you played for the rest of it?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I've actually played great all week.   Probably as good as I've played all year to be honest.   I've had seven 3‑putts and a 4‑putt this week, so in between two really bad putting rounds, I've had two great putting rounds.   Yeah, I'm delighted with that.

Q.   You were out there with Scott today and seemed like you were trading birdies with your home crowd.   How much fun was it? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It was brilliant.   Links golf doesn't get any better when the sea is like a millpond and there's been a bit of moisture in the ground.   It's probably the best golf you can ever play, and it was good for Scott.   He's pushing for The Open and hopefully he's good enough for it.

Q.   You told us last week that this little stretch through the summer is the most important of your career because you're trying to get into this Ryder Cup side.   18 last week and another good finish this week.   How big a platform have you given yourself to go on?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Just trying to get as low as I can every week.   You try to prepare to win every tournament.   Just doesn't manifest like that too many times.   I'm delighted with the way I've played.   Mentally kept it going when I've had a few problems out there, so I'm delighted to give myself a chance to get in a low one today.
