   STEPHEN GALLACHER: Played nicely today. Quite tough the first nine holes I thought. It was playing really long. I never played a practise round so only played four holes to try to keep my energy levels up. I know it's a long walk. It was a great start. I'm normally quite a slow starter so I'm happy with that. 

 Q. Your best round? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: No, 63. 

 Q. Were you runner-up --
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: I think I've had four Top-10s, not sure. 

 Q. I think you have. 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: But no, it was good to play well. It was playing long, as well. Yeah, the course is in great shape, yeah, really good shape.

 Q. Are you just feeding off of growing confidence? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: I'm just going through my game plan and just hitting the shots really, that's all I'm doing. I played a wee bit scrappy for the first sort of five, six, seven. Holed about a 50 footer for par on 7 and that kept me going to stay at level. 15 foot, but from then on, I never really missed a shot. 

 Q. Is this the most consistent you've played in your career? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, it's probably the most consistent I've been, yeah, definitely. Definitely. 

 Q. Fortunate with the lie in the bunker? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: I had a lot of sands, I tried to just nip it. Normally my bunker play has been great. I feel confident. It was right up the downslope on the back, got a wee bit of a flyer on my second shot and thought I hit it perfect. I didn't think I could hit it long. You get your breaks on the course, first round. 

 Q. You've been putting in a lot of work with Bob, as well?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: I've done a bit of work with Bob. I've not seen him in a while so a good to see him this week, yeah. 

 Q. Any observations? 
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Nothing much. Makes a bit of a difference. 

 Q. You said you had not been starting that quickly in the last year or so. How encouraging is it that you got off to such a good start?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, it is good. I'm happy with that. Something to build on. I've had a few good starts over the last, I've been a wee bit slow maybe the last month, but no, that was good today. I'm delighted with that. 

 Q. Is it the best you've felt standing on the first tee in your career that you know the game is there?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: You're still nervous, but I think when the nerves go, time to chuck it. I'm just going for my shots. I'm trying to stay as positive as I can and just, if I hit a bad shot, at least I've not had a bad thought. I'm just picking my target and picking a shot and going for it and take what you get. Try and make par, if you're out of sync and give yourself a chance with a birdie. 

 Q. Do you still feel a win this week will put you in with a chance for The Ryder Cup?
 STEPHEN GALLACHER: No, no chance. Doing a company day for Paul Lawrie on Saturday. He's doing commentating for SKY and I'm doing the prize-giving in a clinic for him because he's missing it.
