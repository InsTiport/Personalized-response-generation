Q. How good was that putter, five in a row on the back nine?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It was good.  I actually hit it really close to the pin today which was good, and I managed to hole those sort of ten-foot putts for birdie I had.  Yeah, it was one of those sort of just go on a roll and kept knocking them in.
Q. We know 2020 was a difficult year for everyone but on a personal level for you, how hard have you found the adjustment back to normal life?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Actually, you know what, it was just draw a line in the sand for 2020.  With everything that happened, the pandemic, my dad losing friends, it was just one of those terrible years.  I couldn't wait for 2021 come really and get back to sort of a bit of normal it will and I back playing and back enjoying it.
So I worked hard in the winter in the gym and on my net in the house, and came out early and showed a bit of formerly doors.
2020, just erase it from my memory and look forward now to 2021.
Q. Pleased to see you playing well again but you're also staying busy off the golf course, very passionate about your foundation.
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, that's sort of nine years in the making, which is good.  Obviously the pandemic hit it hard, so we couldn't go to any primary schools, take kids out, take them to the range and get them on one-on-one coaching and stuff.
But we've got five events next year that has World Ranking points for the first time, European ranking points.  It's going to keep evolving and it's something that I like to give back and I think everybody should at some stage.  It's going well.  I'm proud of it.
