  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I was happy with my four rounds of golf.     Just yesterday I kind of having too many bogeys knackered me I think but on the whole, delighted.  
   
 Q.   You gave it a go on the final day.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, no bogeys, only missed one green.   So I gave myself a lot of chances on the whole towards the goal of the Top‑30.   
   
 Q.   And you and Marcus Fraser, jockeying for position on the board.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I know him very well and he was playing well and I was playing good, so it keeps you both going.  
   
 Q.   Were you conscious of leaderboards?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, you see JimÃ©nez was way ahead, so you go just for as highest up you can from there.  
   
 Q.   So the last few holes, you thought not quite enough of a chance to really get going?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I really needed the weather to be a bit more blustery to be honest, coming from four or five back, you're struggling‑‑ when it's flat calm, the law of averages, seven guys in front of you, not all of them are going to stall.   
So I really needed it to be a wee bit more windy to have a good score and that would propel you right up the board.  
   
 Q.   Easier conditions of the week?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, definitely.   Yeah, perfect.   
   
 Q.   How are you?   Because I gather after Dubai, you're going for an operation?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I tore a meniscal cartilage, so I'm going three days after Dubai to get a quick repair job.   Not getting any younger.  
   
 Q.   Nothing new; you did it awhile ago, but refresh the memory how.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I done it at the start of the year training in the gym and it just settled down, and it's flared up   the last two months and it's torn.   So it has to be done.   
   
 Q.   You've done well to get this far, haven't you?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I have, actually.   A lot of painkillers and anti‑inflammatories.  
   
 Q.   Does it pose problems when you're going around?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I can't get down on my knee to read a putt properly, so I'm just sort of hitting it and hoping at the moment.   It's working quite good; I might stick to that.   
   
 Q.   So what's involved, you say four more days in action in the Dubai World Championship, good finish to the year, and then you're under the knife?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Correct.   
   
 Q.   Where?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:     At the Nuffield's Hospital in Glasgow.  
   
 Q.   So you will get home and the surgeons there?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I know them, everything's good, so it's done and dusted.  
   
 Q.   And they have given a good verdict that‑‑  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, four to six weeks recovery, as well, which is good.   Should be fine and fit for Abu Dhabi.   
   
 Q.   How pleased are you?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I'm delighted.   You know, I hit 17 greens today and I had five birdies, no bogeys, which is just a shame; the weather was so benign.   If there was a bit of wind, the scoring wouldn't have been so good.  
   
 Q.   Sure to be a Top‑5 position, after this week, how positive is that going to the next tournament, the last tournament of the year?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, well, I thought I needed a couple of Top‑10s to get into the Top‑30 for Muirfield at the end of the year.   That's sort of my short‑term goal.   
So four rounds, I'm playing really well, so I give Dubai a good shot now.  
   
 Q.   You've been playing well all year?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I've been playing good, I've had a lot of chances to win and hopefully keep doing that and keep knocking on the door and will take one here or there.
