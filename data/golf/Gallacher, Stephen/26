  STEPHEN GALLACHER: Played great the last two weeks really and got nothing out of it, so it's just a wee bit disappointing, that's all.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: Easier today, I think, because the wind wasn't just straight down, it was more straight across, so as long as you could control the ball both ways, it was playable, definitely playable today.Q. What were you thinking this morning when you saw the weather conditions?STEPHEN GALLACHER: Nothing really.  I knew it was cancelled, so the course can take -- you didn't even notice it had rained.  It was just perfect, really.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, I'll probably go and see Dave Stockton in America, go a couple of days early and see him for a couple of weeks.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: I know it is.  My stats will tell me that.
