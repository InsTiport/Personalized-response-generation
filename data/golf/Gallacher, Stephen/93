 Q.   Any highlights in particular?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, anything you shoot under par around here is pretty good.   I birdied 16 and 18 and missed a few coming in.   Could have been a bit better but I'll take 2â€‘under.   
   
 Q.   A bit different kettle of fish here, isn't it?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, you've got to burn your toes here.   You can't let your guard down for two minutes here.   It's such a tough golf course.   You just have to go really low at the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Nice position to be in with Kingsbarns coming tomorrow, chance to go low there?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, a chance to go low, so that's where the best scores have been at Kingsbarns, so see how it goes tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Game feeling good?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, feeling up for it.   See what happens, anyway.   
   
 Q.   Must be always nice coming back here, as a past champion as well.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, you get some good memories, hopefully draw on them.
