Q.   2‑under par, how was that today? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, it was solid.   It was pretty good.   It's just I had a few bogeys today.   I had six birdies, which is disappointing to chuck in a few 3‑putts.   But need to go low tomorrow to have a chance. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on the way things worked out today, presumably those birdies late on really give you the chance. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I had a few‑‑ I thought I gave myself a lot of chances today and chucked in a couple 3‑putts sort of stopped me in the track but it was a good finish, a couple birdies at the end.

Q.   Are you conscious of leaderboards?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not really.   Not today.

Q.   But you're still nicely in the hunt with those late birdies, aren't you? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, you know, unless someone goes away stupidly, you need a 63 or something. 

Q.   Feel capable of that yourself?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I had six birdies today.   Just don't have any bogeys.   But I do feel as if it's in there. 

Q.   And this is down to yourself, down to playing conditions, down to the rough; a combination? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, the course is great.   It wasn't as swirly today, the wind, so there was a few more birdie chances.   You could go at the tight flags but yesterday you couldn't really go at them because you didn't really know if you were going to get the wind into or down. 
I think this is the way the course normally plays, the tight flags, if you're attacking, you hit a good shot and you get rewarded.
