STEPHEN GALLACHER: Took a good 6, bizarre, but I'll take it.  I hit some lovely shots coming in.
Q. Talk to us about the 3-iron.  Did Jack choose that for you or was that your inspiration?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: No, he was confident on it.  He said -- well, it was only one club.  It was just whether the ball flight -- I had to flight it in a little bit.  It was 240, so trying to land it 225 and run it up the green.  It just came off perfect.  The perfect trajectory and got a good bounce and just thought it was going to run up to eight-foot or something like that and it went in.  First one as a pro.
Q. How many have you had in total?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Two.  Just bizarre.
Q. So how quickly did it sink in that this had actually happened?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, I turned away and just heard everybody shout, so I was just, like, "Oh, it's in."  Nice feeling, but it's a tough hole to drive to be honest.  Probably as good a drive as I could hit.  I had 330.  Tough shot to hit a wood in, and hit a lovely 6-iron at the last, and 9, as well, a tough hole.  I managed to knock that in, so 7-under was my last 11 holes I think.
Q. How much does that change for you mentally, even how you were feeling, because you're always working and grinding, but then you get this welcome boost?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, it's one of the toughest courses we play all year to be honest.  It's in unbelievable condition.  The greens are tough.  You've got to hit it in the right spots.  One of the guys chipped up today.  It's just a really tough course, demanding.
All facets of the game have to be firing.  I think single figures has won it every time it's been here, so to get a good under par -- I was going along okay at par.  I would have took that today but 5-under's better.
