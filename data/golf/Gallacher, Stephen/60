  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It was quite a game of two halves really.   4‑under the front nine and then 3‑up, and then our opponents were the same, I think they were 4‑under the back nine, so it was a great game.   
You know, we had a chance.   We were 1‑down with two to go. 

Q.   Nature of foursomes, looked like plain sailing for a while there. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   They just held us with three birdies in a row.   So it went from sort of‑‑ we went from 3‑up to level and then they birdied the next hole ‑‑ about three holes later, and all of a sudden we're 1‑down.   We finished birdie, birdie par.   Just a same I didn't hole the putt at the last.   Would have been a great game.

Q.   Nice to have that putt to win a match? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   16, 17 was strong for us.   We put them under a bit of pressure and then just it was good enough for a halve but not good enough for the win.

Q.   Are you relishing this, being involved in a team event like this? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, it's rubbish, isn't it.   Yeah, this is where you want to be playing, isn't it.

Q.   It's different, a different dynamic to anything that you have at other times during the year. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, that's why it's so fun.   You're not playing for yourself.   You're playing for your team, your teammates, your continent, everybody. 

Q.   When you look at the board, you'll see a couple of halves that makes it that much sweeter for Europe on the day?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   When I looked up about half an hour ago, it was all red, so at least we've taken a wee bit off them.
