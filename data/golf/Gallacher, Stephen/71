  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I would have took a playoff on Monday.   I was just happy to get playing on Monday to be honest. 
Yeah, I was pleased‑‑ I actually hit the ball really, really well.   It was only the short irons I was really struggling with.   I could not really get in my posture.   They were the ones that were causing me a wee bit of concern.   Three times I left myself‑‑ I just could not seem to hit it.   I was hitting too hard, that was the thing.

Q.   What happened on the second‑‑
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I was in a divot, in a sandy divot and trying to back foot it and just caught it a wee bit clean. 
It was good, the thing was, I never‑‑ that was the only bad shot I really hit, and it was because I was in a divot and I had to sort of change the way I was going to play it.   Yeah, I'm happy. 

Q.   Standing over the 18th, what were you thinking? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I knew I needed to hole it to have a chance.   The guys still had a chance, so that was me‑‑ it was a great putt.   Just a shame I could not do it again. 
I knew on 18 the guys were already in, so to have a chance, I knew I needed to hole it. 

Q.   What did you hit on the second on 18?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   5‑iron.   I hit 6‑iron in the first round and then 5‑iron the next round.   Just trying to hit the same shot but I just never quite got it. 

Q.   When you've come so close, despite the back and all that, you've come so close, how does that bode with The Ryder Cup qualifying start next week to be back in next year?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, it's 13 months, isn't it.   I'm not really thinking about that until next year really. 
Obviously I would like to be in it, but got Wales and Sweden and Switzerland first and Dunhill and Portugal. 
I'm going for an MRI tomorrow just to see what the sort of damage is. 

Q.   Paul McGinley talks of horses for courses and no one has a better record than you in ten years here. 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, kind of like the course, but if I can just keep playing the way I'm playing, I'm sure I'll be knocking on the door.
