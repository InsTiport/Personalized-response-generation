  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I think it's one of these ones where if I hadn't had three weeks off, I probably would have‑‑ if something hadn't happened, it's one of the ones I went all out to get in it and was a bit knackered. 
Just having such a break, it's one of those ones I have to combat even to walk, getting the walking and getting the rust away for next week. 

Q.   Did you have a night with the captain last night? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It was good.   Had a great night.   It was brilliant.   It was just a buffet at the hotel, just a private room with the caddies and had a good craic.   It was just general stuff I've heard in e‑mails, just to reiterate, going over the range, what the clothing is like. 

Q.   How exciting is it? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   It's very exciting.   You have Lee Westwood, Olazabal was there, McGinley's holed the winning putt, Tommy's played in a few, and me and Jamie were sitting there, all the caddies are very experienced, as well, 20‑odd years.   It's going to be great.   I'm going to go out tomorrow and try and get something going, hole a few putts, a few birdies and see what happens. 

Q.   Did playing with Thomas help today from not getting too down on yourself?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, he's trying to beat me.   He's not bothered with that.   Just absolutely nothing, if I could get a bounce back, if I could get a bad lie, I got it.   It was one of those days.   These things happen. 

Q.   Would you prefer to play all four rounds here or would two be enough? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Is one enough?   (Laughter).   I'll give it my best, you never know.   I've shot 63 around here.   It was slow out there today, as well.   Waited on every shot so couldn't really get a bit of momentum going.   Well, I couldn't, certainly.   Thongchai played well.   Give it a good shot tomorrow and see what happens.
