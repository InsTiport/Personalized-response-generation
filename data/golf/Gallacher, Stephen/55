  STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I'm happy with 66.   Obviously a bit disappointed, I never capitalised the last couple of holes, but on the whole I'm delighted with the weekend's work.   
   
 Q.   Thumb is okay having hit the tree on the 17?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I knew that club‑‑ I was going to have to sacrifice a club.   So I had to go longer.   If I went shorter I was going to really smash my hands.   Yeah, hurt my thumb a bit but I should be all right.  
   
 Q.   You were 12 back at the start of play today?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Well, I mean, it's a tough course.   Anything can happen out here.   The wind sort of swirls a bit in the end.   I'm just trying to post as low a number as I could.  
   
 Q.   How is it playing?   We have a lot of sunshine but you mentioned the wind and that seems to be tricky regardless?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, there's a touch of luck involved.   You need to get the gust at the right time.   If you get it at the wrong time, it can because problems, but it's going to happen to everyone, so there's no point dwelling on it.  
   
 Q.   Come what may, a significant finish here regardless of what the leaders do.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I'm delighted with that.   Especially after I didn't have too good a second round, so I'm delighted with 9‑under at the weekends which is good.
