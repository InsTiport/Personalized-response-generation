Q. How was it today?STEPHEN GALLACHER: It's a game of two halves out there, really.  Score as low as you could going out because you knew it was going to be really tough coming back in.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: I would have liked to have been a couple back, to be honest.  I had plenty of chances out there.  I left a few.  I knew it was going to be tough, hit a couple of errant drives at the end, just in the bunkers and easy bogeys.  You never know, though, a good score tomorrow could peel you right up the field.Q. Weather is due to change overnight.  Could that could help you?STEPHEN GALLACHER: I hope so.  I've played the course in worse weather than that, so I know how to kind of handle it.  It's just how bad it gets.  The forecast is terrible.Q. How familiar are you with -- would you say this is a course you know very well?STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, I play it every year and as an amateur and socially, as well.  I've played it in different winds if that makes any bear.  I've played it the opposite way, I've played it sideways, so I kind of know how the course plays.  It's just a case of hitting it where you want to hit it.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, it's always good playing in The Open regardless, Scotland or England.  You know, it is what it is.  The Open is one of the best tournaments we play in.  The fans came out in force today and braved the elements.Q. Paul Lawrie, are you stunned by what he's done today?STEPHEN GALLACHER: Not at all.  No.  Paul, he's been playing well a couple of months now and he's a great wind player now, so.  He's an Open player.  Apart from winning it, he's done really well in it, as well.  No.  He loves playing in this weather, too.Q. (Inaudible.)STEPHEN GALLACHER: Well, we're trying to beat each other, but we're happy to see other guys up there.Q. Playing in the wind (inaudible)?STEPHEN GALLACHER: I think it was windy kind of the whole back nine.  If it's forecast 25, 30, it doesn't matter what you do.  It's just a battle of survival.
