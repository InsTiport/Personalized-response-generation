Q Are you feeling pretty good about your game?  It looks like you've turned a bit of a corner?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Yeah, I'm starting to play well.  More confident, getting more confident every week.  So really looking forward to the next through days.
Q Reading between the lines, does that mean a frustrating and slightly irritating year?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: It has, yeah.  You are buying on the mark there.  Just looking forward.
Q You are still in a tidy position, aren't you?  61st in the Race to Dubai.  The aim is to be getting into the season ender?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Is it?  Thanks, I never thought of that.  I've got this week first.  The only thing I'm thinking about is tomorrow, to be honest.
Q You sound positive.  Are you?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: I feel as if I'm starting to hit good shots.  There is no reason why you shouldn't be positive.
Q The three birdies, what are the distances to the putts there?
STEPHEN GALLACHER: Two-putt into 12.  Left it about six feet on 8.  Six feet on the next.
