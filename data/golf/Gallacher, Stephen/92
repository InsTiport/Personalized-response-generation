Q.   Tidy little finish there.   Holed your second shot on 17? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   5â€‘iron, 200 yards.   I would have took a four, so getting a two is better.   Gets me back in the hunt.   It was 400, 500 yards into the wind, hit a good drive and still had 200 yards to go. 

Q.   Did you see it go in from where you were? 
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, totally blind. 

Q.   People on the green?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   They were jumping around, so I knew it was in. 
Good birdie on the last, good finish.   Just what I needed for tomorrow. 

Q.   With Grace racing away there, is there a feeling of playing for second?
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I think you are.   Well, who knows in golf.   But it's down to him, you know.   I've just got to keep to my own game and see what happens.
