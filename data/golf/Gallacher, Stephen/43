  IAN POULTER: Home fans are out there giving us great support is we couldn't manage to get it done today, so it's a shame.Q. How did that feel as a debut?STEPHEN GALLACHER: The first tee was magic, just exactly what I was expecting.  The fans have been great all the way around.  Just a shame we never really got the birdies today to compete with them.Q. Can you describe from your perspective what happened out there today?IAN POULTER: We don't hole enough putts, that simple.  Clearly in this format, you have to hole putts.  We didn't do that.  They did, and obviously it's a point on the board for them.Q. And not The Ryder Cup debut you would have hoped for, but how would you describe it?STEPHEN GALLACHER: Just the same as what Ian said.  Took me a few holes to kind of settle in and find my rhythm and when we did, we never really holed any putts.  You have to got to have birdies in this format, and we were a bit shy today, and that's the difference.
