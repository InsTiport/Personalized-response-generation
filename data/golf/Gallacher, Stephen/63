 Q.   Good day?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I played good all week actually.   Just the wind the first couple of days just got the better of us, a couple of loose shots at the wrong time and I had three double‑bogeys.   But today I played great, coming down the stretch was pretty tough.   The wind switched into.   But it was good.   I'm happy, very happy.  
   
 Q.   And looking like a Top‑10.   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Absolutely, I'll take that.   
   
 Q.   And everything that comes with it?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I had to kind of stay to cement my Masters.   I'm 39th.   I was trying to stay Top‑50 for the end of the month so hopefully that will do it now.  
   
 Q.   And Ryder Cup points, as well.  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I don't think about that.   It's more just to try and stay in the Top‑50 for the Masters.   That's all I was thinking about real.  
   
 Q.   Good shape coming in?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, I thought I played okay at Honda and missed by a couple.   Got a new driver this week.   I've been driving the ball good but got a new one and it's been great.   You need it around here, every hole.   
   
 Q.   A few extra yards?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Yeah, hitting it a wee bit further.   You have to around here because if not you're hitting 3‑iron every hole.  
   
 Q.   You talked yesterday about not counting your chickens before they hatch in relation to August, but you must be pretty well locked in?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I would think so.   I would hope so.   
   
 Q.   Does it change your schedule now at all?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   No, not at all.   
   
 Q.   What are you going to do?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   I've got a game in Malaysia, and then the Masters.   
   
 Q.   Do you think out there at any point, I can win this, this afternoon?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not when the guy was out‑‑ I was ten back almost at the start.   I was just trying to have as many birdies as I could, that was all, just to try to get up the leaderboard.   
   
 Q.   And Ryder Cup‑‑  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Still got six, seven months to go for that.   It all helps.   I'm just not even thinking about that.   Just concentrating on trying to do as well as I could.   
   
 Q.   With The Ryder Cup, is it difficult to put out of your mind?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not really.   The only people that mention it is you guys.   
   
 Q.   What do you take away playing these three events?  
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Three tough courses for a start.   Yeah, I like it.   You know, it's a good experience for me, first time I played a PGA event and it's only my second time playing these ones, so it was a great experience.  
   
 Q.   Would you like to play here more often?   
STEPHEN GALLACHER:   Not full‑time.   My kids are in school and they are happy.   More just to sort of play before the weeks you can, before majors and stuff like that.
