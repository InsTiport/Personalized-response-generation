  PETE KOWALSKI: We welcome Zach Olsen from Cordova, Tennessee, 5 & 3 winner over 2014 U.S. Junior Amateur Champion, Will Zalatoris. Well played, congratulations.  By the score, by looking at the number, 5 & 3, a convincing winner over Will.  Was it closer than it looked?ZACH OLSEN: I felt like it was a lot closer than it ended up.  We were both hitting a lot of good shots.  I think I just got off to a big lead and I think from then on, we kind of played real even from then on.PETE KOWALSKI: Tell us how you got the big lead.ZACH OLSEN: I birdied 1 and 3, and I saw I was 2-up through three it.  He hit it in the water and then I was 1-up.    We had a lot of action on the first six or seven holes.PETE KOWALSKI: You get to the third hole and you're 3-up, you lose two in a row, your emotions are going back and forth a little bit, I'm sure.ZACH OLSEN: Yeah, but he made birdie, and I was hitting good slots and had good birdie looks on both holes and just wasn't able to convert.PETE KOWALSKI: U.S. Amateur quarterfinal achievement.  How does that rank with your golf success?ZACH OLSEN: Obviously it's an honor to get that far.  I was in the round of 32 last year and lost the first match of I guess what would be today. I was real excited to get a chance to come back.Q. In your play today, what was the best part of your game?  Did you drive it well?  Did you hit it close?  Did you make a lot of putts?  What was the best part.ZACH OLSEN: I think I drove it really well.  I was able to get the tee after the first hole, and then I think I hit a lot of fairways.  When I was hitting them a lot in the fairway, I think it was tough for Will to get momentum because I was always in a good position.Q. He made that two-hole run to get back to -- you were just 1-up.  What did you do next to get the lead again?ZACH OLSEN: We both halved 8 and then I birdied 9.  I was 2-up, and then I won 11 and then I won 14 I guess and then finally 15.Q. Downstairs you were talking about you didn't play well in June.  What have been some of your highlights of the summer coming into this week?ZACH OLSEN: I played well at the Players Am.  I finished fourth there, and then I played the Southern Am; I think I finished like 30th there; and then the Western Am, I missed the first cut.  I think I missed it by one.  But those two events, I felt like I played a lot better than my finishes.PETE KOWALSKI: Did you hear from anybody from Oklahoma State who has had success in this championship?ZACH OLSEN: Not yet but the night's still young I guess, is the best way to put it.Q. What did you hit into 6?ZACH OLSEN: Both times I laid up with irons and hit wedges in.Q. How far did you have into the green?ZACH OLSEN: The first round, I hit it a little too close, I hit it to 57 and then 105.Q. Was that a full wedge?ZACH OLSEN: Yeah.PETE KOWALSKI: How about 15?ZACH OLSEN: I hit 5-wood both times.PETE KOWALSKI: How about your physical status right now after two rounds in one day?ZACH OLSEN: I'm feeling good.  I'd be ready to go again if I need to.PETE KOWALSKI: Congratulations.
