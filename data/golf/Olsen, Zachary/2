  ZACHARY OLSEN:   You know, it's a fun day.   Just disappointed how I played a little bit.  
   
 Q.   You talked the other day about the nerves maybe would hit you.   When it hit you, did they today?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   No, actually it didn't.   I started off with par, birdie.   No, it felt pretty good all day.  
   
 Q.   What was it like having to stop your round in the middle?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   Pretty boring sitting around the locker room.   We got to warm up and go back out.   So, not too bad.  
   
 Q.   When you tee it up and you now have a round under your belt, I mean was it everything you thought it would be despite the disappointing couple of shots that you had out there?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   Yeah.   I would say yes, it was fun to play in my home town event, see friends and family, come out and support me.   It's really cool.  
   
 Q.   Did you go and play -- do you look at it now as just a golfer and let the nerves try to settle away instead of trying to get all caught up in this being the first time teeing it up as a PGA guy, especially at home?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   I played the Arnold Palmer.   I got a little experience.   The home town atmosphere is a lot different and yeah, it's a lot different.  
   
 Q.   What happened with the delay, did you try to get some pointers on the advice of some of the old pros back there?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   No.   I didn't really talk to many people.   I took a nap.  
   
 Q.   How do you get ready for tomorrow?   How do you look at today and try to build on what to do tomorrow?  
    ZACHARY OLSEN:   I did a lot of good things today so I think I'm going to go to the range and hit a few golf balls, see if I can iron out a few shots out there, have a good round tomorrow.
