Q. You've added 68 to yesterday's 66.  Just compare your play on the two days for me.
MATTHIEU PAVON: I mean, the game was pretty solid today.  Today just a few strategy mistake, missed a shot at the wrong place.  This is the only big difference of these two days.
Q. A new driver in the bag.  It's crucial to get the ball in the fairway here.  How is the new driver feeling?
MATTHIEU PAVON: Feels like the G410 is working very good this week.  I mean, my ball flight is great.  Pretty easy to manage the ball from left to right for me.  So I hit a lot of fairways.  Missed some, but that's life.  But really happy with the driver this week.
Q. You started this new season with a second place in Mauritius, been a little quiet since.  Did you feel coming into this week was going to be a better one?
MATTHIEU PAVON: I mean, I missed some cuts, but the game was on.  Nothing big, just some moments I didn't took.  I mean, I feel great this week, and I just try to do my best like I did in Mauritius.
Q. Your father was a professional footballer in France; how did having a professional sportsman as a dad influence you?  Did you take some of his traits?  Are you as competitive as he is?
MATTHIEU PAVON: I mean, that's two different sports, but they're both high level, so they teach me good values.  I try to follow them every day, and yes, he loves me a lot, he helped me with his love mostly, nothing special, nothing mentally special.  He gave me all he got, and that's helped me a lot.
