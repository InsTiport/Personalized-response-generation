 Q.  Wonderful opening effort, 5-under total, what was the secret?  
MATTHIEU PAVON: Yeah, I'm really happy on the course today.  I hit really got driver today.  I didn't miss any, so no bad situation from the tee.  I holed many putts.  I mean, the putter was on fire today.  I find a good roll and I just keep going and make some putts all day long.   
 Q.  The greens are clearly a big challenge here.  What is the secret as far as you're concerned, what did you find out there?  
MATTHIEU PAVON: You have to be on the right side of the green because you start struggling to make pars or birdies.  So I just try to put the ball in the right position, and then just really focus on the roll because the greens are pretty slopey.   
 Q.  It's your third appearance in the Trophee Hassan, and just outside the Top-10 in your debut in 2017.  What do you like about the course?  
MATTHIEU PAVON: I really like this place.  It's a really hard course for me.  It feels like a major course.  It's a fantastic one and very tight one, so I appreciate to play against this strong course.   
 Q.  You haven't played since the Maybank, but you've been clearly working hard on your game.  Have you enjoyed that process, getting ready for this next run of tournaments?  
MATTHIEU PAVON: Yeah, I played in two tournaments, French tournament, and I played pretty solid in those two events.  I'm in good form and I just try to continue this.
