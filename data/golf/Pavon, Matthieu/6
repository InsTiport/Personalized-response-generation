Q. Disappointing week last week, how pleasing is it to get off to a good start here with a 68?
MATTHIEU PAVON: Yeah, last week was a bit tough for me.  I played the baddest round of maybe my last four years.
Now it's a new tournament.  I feel great on the links golf course like I did last year, so I just try to hit good low shots, and that resulted in what happened today.
Q. Five birdies and no dropped shots, and very narrow fairways out there today.
MATTHIEU PAVON: Yeah, I mean, the fairways are pretty narrow and firm, and sometimes you can just pitch on and lay on the rough.  It's pretty hard because on the rough, you can have some flyers.  The ball is flying a lot and the greens are pretty firm.  So it make the -- it's tough to put the ball close.
Q. What's pleased you most about the round today?
MATTHIEU PAVON: I mean, attitude was great.  Putting, also.  I holed a few.  I holed a few, missed some.  But I mean, everything was rolling out there.
