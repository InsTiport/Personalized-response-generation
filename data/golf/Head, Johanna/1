   COLIN CALLANDER: This is a course you know pretty well. 
 JOHANNA HEAD: Yeah my sister and I played here -- nine rounds.
 COLIN CALLANDER: Are you playing golf in America this year? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: Yeah, I've played all of it. I haven't played the European Tour this year. Yeah, I've been focusing over there. 

 Q. Who were you and your sister playing with?
 JOHANNA HEAD: We beat Keith Maxwell and Tony Johnstone 5 & 4 and in the final -- but the amateurs players, we took the money for first place,  Â£1,600, which I needed in those days. 
 I lived here eight years ago just for six months, and we were born in Ascot, just around the corner. 
 I didn't know the course quite well, but I haven't played it since the last British Open but I have a caddie who is from here. He's a Sunningdale caddie, so he's really helped me with lines off the tees and really on-course management. 

 Q. What's his name?
 JOHANNA HEAD: Gary, I can't remember his surname. He's one of the kids. Caddies for Simon Khan.
 COLIN CALLANDER: What were conditions like out there today? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: The best conditions. I wouldn't say it's easy. Well, I suppose the conditions were easy because there was hardly any wind, but the course was playing absolutely lovely. It really is lovely. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: For the sake of the rest of the guys, can you go through the birdies? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: Yes. On the first I hit 7-wood to the front of the green and 2-putted.
 The second hole, I hit a 3-wood off the tee, 7-wood on to the back of the green and 2-putted. 
 6, I actually holed a 5-iron into that green and holed a really nice 20-footer. 
 The 9th, I hit driver off the tee, hit it in the bunker just pin-high left and got up-and-down. 
 10, I hit a rescue and didn't quite get to the front of the green. I didn't hit it very well and holed the putt. 
 14, obviously driver 3-wood just short of the green and hit it to about five feet and holed the putt. 
 On 17, I hit 6-iron into the green and hit it to about 25 feet. 

 Q. You only dropped one shot at the fifth?
 JOHANNA HEAD: Yeah, because I missed the fairway bunker and had to just chip out. 

 Q. Any other saves or was it stress-free?
 JOHANNA HEAD: Pretty stress-free. On 11, I had an 8-footer for par which I holed. 

 Q. How has your year been?
 JOHANNA HEAD: Frustrating. I've been playing well. I just need to keep concentrating. I haven't quite got the finishes yet. 

 Q. Where are you based in the States?
 JOHANNA HEAD: I live in Orlando. I spend most of the year in Orlando in America. I just have a couple of weeks in the U.K. 

 Q. What would you advise to European players -- to start playing in America? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: Yes, but you have to make sure that you are not going to go over there and just waste your time. You've got to be able to play in Europe and compete to have a chance to play in America. 

 Q. So the top players --
 JOHANNA HEAD: Not necessarily the top players, but at least in tournaments, you don't necessarily need to win. I didn't win before I went to America, in Europe, so definitely since I've been in America, my game has just improved so much. 

 Q. How long have you been there?
 JOHANNA HEAD: Seven years. 

 Q. With Ian Poulter -- inaudible -- how did that come about? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: My husband caddied for Ian. I met his manager and we got together 18 months ago and he's been mentoring me for the last 18. No, I've learned a lot. I've learned how to be patient and stay focused. 
 Ian isn't the one mentoring me; it's Paul mentoring me. He's great, though. We get along really well with him and have a lot of fun together. I know them quite well. 

 Q. Where do you stay, what course? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: Champion's Gate. I've got an attachment there. 

 Q. Do you get coached by David? 
 JOHANNA HEAD: No. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 JOHANNA HEAD: I don't see him much but I'm on the phone every day. 

 Q. What are you going to do now?
 JOHANNA HEAD: I'm going to go have lunch.
