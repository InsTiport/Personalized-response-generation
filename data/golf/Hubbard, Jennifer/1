JENNIFER HUBBARD: He is pretty good about if he sees something on the course that he thinks will help me, he will mention it, but we try not to get too mechanical out there on the course. Afterwards he can help me.

JENNIFER HUBBARD: It is nice because I know that he will talk to me. Nobody else will. (Laughs).

JENNIFER HUBBARD: I am sure there are going to be a lot of low rounds today. I don't think 68 will be the lowest round. It is an old-fashioned course. The greens are small and I think that is good for me. The fairways are narrow. I generally hit the ball straight so don't get into a whole lot of trouble.

JENNIFER HUBBARD: Yeah, you can always improve on every aspect of your game.

JENNIFER HUBBARD: I didn't really have a feeling one way or the other. I pretty much thought I'd have a good round but I didn't know that I'd shoot 4-under. That's good for me.

JENNIFER HUBBARD: Hitting a lot of greens and giving myself birdie opportunities and then I hit my -- actually didn't birdie one of the really short par 5s, No. 2, I left one out there. I am going to go one shot at a time.
