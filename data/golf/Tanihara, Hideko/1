HIDEKO TANIHARA: My shot has been good this whole week.  I knew it would come down to the putting.  So I was just -- the putting was pretty good, so I'm happy.
Q. How confident are you heading into tomorrow whether you play Dustin Johnson or Alex Noren?
HIDEKO TANIHARA: I'm taking steps to play and I know that all the opponents that I play are really tough to play.  So whoever it's going to be, it's going to be a tough game tomorrow.
Q. What was it like out there competing, getting beyond maybe perhaps your expectations your first three days and now you find yourself in the final day here?
HIDEKO TANIHARA: My goal was to get to the Masters and probably maybe top 8 would get me in.  Wasn't sure.  Now the top 4 got me here.  I'm really excited and happy.
Q. About this week here on the PGA Tour, what is it about this format, match play, that you like playing and excelling compared to stroke play on the PGA Tour?
HIDEKO TANIHARA: It's a one-on-one matchup.  So I have to think about how the opponent plays.  There's a lot more strategy in thinking in playing this kind of format.
Q. How do you feel about being in the last four?
HIDEKO TANIHARA: Just happy to -- I wasn't really expecting to be in the last four, but I'm really happy and really looking forward to it.
Q. You must be enjoying this match play?
HIDEKO TANIHARA: I really enjoy it.  We don't get that much opportunity to play with all these great players, so it's really fun.
