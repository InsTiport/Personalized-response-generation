Q. You're coming off a 74 on No. 2.  It's a tough course, but hey, you made it to match play.  How does it feel?
BLAKE WINDRED: Yeah, it feels good.  It's a little bit of a relief.  It's pretty -- it's just a tough course, isn't it, so you don't know -- you can never be comfortable out there, I feel.  I hit a lot of good shots today, so that was a good sign.  But yeah, the course really held up pretty tough.  But no, I am very happy to go through.
Q. So you'll play this course tomorrow; any strategy changes?  How are you going to approach it tomorrow in match play?
BLAKE WINDRED: Yeah, I think off the tee, although it is pretty tight, the consequences are pretty brutal, especially if you miss the fairways.  But you really need to just step up there and trust the drive and just smoke it down there, not really worry about where the trouble is.  So just positive thoughts.  I mean, if I hit it the same and roll it the same, I'll be very happy.  Just need a few more putts to drop instead of sort of lip-outs.  But I'll be right there if that happens.
Q. What are the plans for the rest of the day?  You've got about 24 hours of rest.
BLAKE WINDRED: Yeah, that's it.  It's going to be nice.  Might have a little swim, nap, food.  Yeah, that's good.  It's going to be good.
