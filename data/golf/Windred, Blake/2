Q. Great round, 67 on No. 4.  How did you feel today?
BLAKE WINDRED: Yeah, I felt pretty good, pretty comfortable.  It was quite hot out there early and then that back nine we just had really, really good conditions.  I was able to take advantage of it, so I was pretty pleased with the round in the end.
Q. Four birdies on that back nine, take me through that, what led to the success there?
BLAKE WINDRED: I think just I stayed very patient.  I 3-putted number 8 to go 2-over par and then obviously birdied the next, which kind of got me back.
And then I hit a few more good shots and, yeah, basically I think just staying patient and then taking one shot at a time.  I really nailed a couple of putts and a couple of shots that enabled me to make pretty nice birdies, especially on a couple of the hard holes, too.  So I was very, very happy with it.
Q. Coming to Pinehurst from Australia, with your host family here.  How do you feel about the courses, how do you feel about the town?
BLAKE WINDRED: Yeah, it's such a good town.  There's so many great courses here and, yeah, it's been awesome to have a great host family.
And I feel very comfortable on these courses.  No. 2 is probably a little bit tougher, so I'm going to be in for a nice big day tomorrow.  But, yeah, overall I feel very comfortable and I'm just enjoying it.
Q. Any strategy changes for tomorrow on No. 2?
BLAKE WINDRED: No, no, I mean I think I really wanted to take advantage of the No. 4 course today, in good conditions, and then tomorrow that kind of sets me up, hit more fairways -- hit plenty of fairways today, so if I do more of the same tomorrow, I'll be right there.  Yeah, hopefully roll a few more putts in too.
