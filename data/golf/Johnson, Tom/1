 Q.  Nice round today. 
 TOM JOHNSON:  Thank you, it was a good day.  I made some putts finally.  It was good.  I just played solid.  I didn't really hit it extraordinarily well, but I kept it loose. 
 I was just trying to have fun with it.  Me and my caddie TC did a good job of that, got some putts to go. 

 Q.  You looked like you were having a good time out on the golf course.  How big of a deal is that? 
 TOM JOHNSON:  It's huge for me because lately I've just been kind of putting too much pressure on myself and getting in my own way, and that's the last thing I want to do is get in my own way.  I just figure I'm going to try to have fun no matter where the ball goes, and it worked today.  It seems like a good strategy. 

 Q.  You're in the right town to have a good time, New Orleans.  Tell me a little bit about this golf course. 
 TOM JOHNSON:  It's a good track.  I'm a rookie so it's my first time seeing it, but with all the changes and everything, I think that's a good thing because it's kind of new for everybody.  It's a little bit soft right now.  The greens are at a pace where you can kind of go at them a little bit and not really worry about running them off the green or everything.  So it's good.  If you want to be aggressive, it's a little softer, you can hit some putts aggressively. 

 Q.  Rookie on Tour, first time to New Orleans.  Have you been to Bourbon Street yet?  Tell me the truth. 
 TOM JOHNSON:  I have, I have.  My caddie TC is from New Orleans, and we actually stayed on Bourbon Street when he got married here.  I've seen it before.  This time is a little more mellow, though.  I'm being a little better. 

 Q.  You've got to stick to business just a little bit. 
 TOM JOHNSON:  Exactly. 

 Q.  Great playing today, keep it up the rest of the week. 
 TOM JOHNSON:  Thanks.
