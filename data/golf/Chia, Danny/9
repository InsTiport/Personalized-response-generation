DANNY CHIA: It's a great feeling.  Getting to the team by merit is a wonderful feeling.  Had a great year last year.  Can't ask for anything more.   
 Q.  Is there an excitement in playing a team event, something different to what you would normally be doing?  
DANNY CHIA: I didn't feel it that much right now.  Probably the excitement will kick in tomorrow, maybe when the matches start, yeah.   
 Q.  Presumably there's a different feeling about it.  I know you're normally doing all your own individual preparations, but here, being part of a bigger setup?  
DANNY CHIA: I think it is a bit different.  That's why this week, we spend a lot of time together with our teammates.  We have dinner almost every night together to try to get closer to each other to have some kind of a chemistry when we get to partner with each other.  I think that works out pretty well.  Spending a lot of time talking about the game plan and watch quite closely about his game during the practise rounds, as well.   
 Q.  Clearly these are early stages, but how is Jeev as a captain?  
DANNY CHIA: I think he's great.  He's been very fantastic since Monday when I was here.  I've been looked after really well.  Make sure whatever we need, he gets it for us.  No complaints about that, yeah.   
 Q.  Given that you're playing here in Kuala Lumpur, is there an onus on you?  Are you feeling any different kind of pressure on yourself to actually perform well?  
DANNY CHIA: Always do.  But I think it's a very positive pressure on me that drives me to want to do well and trying really hard to game plan for the team.  Yeah, it will be a great week.
