DANNY CHIA: Yeah, hit the ball and putted very solid on the front nine today.  Stiffed it.  I think I probably hit to about five feet three times on the front nine.
Q. When was the last time you did something like that?
DANNY CHIA: I don't know, must be quite some time ago.
Q. Back nine, just a little bit different.  You hung in there.  You must have been quite pleased to have kept that score running?
DANNY CHIA: Yeah, I think I just probably try a bit too hard on the back nine with my putting.  I'm still hitting it quite solid.   Just didn't make as many putts as the front nine.  But that's golf.  You can't make everything.
Q. Is this score a reflection of how you've been hitting it the last few weeks?
DANNY CHIA: I think the last two weeks, I've been start hitting the ball a bit more solid.  I think the driving has been showing some good sign, because I haven't been driving the ball that well this year.
Q. What's brought about the change with the driver?
DANNY CHIA: I think some technical stuff.  I think this year, most of the time, I'm getting a bit too much inside on the backswing with my driver and come over the top most of the time and hit a lot of bad drives.
Two weeks ago, I start to get a bit more on-line with my backswing and starting to hit it straighter.
Q. Just a few shots behind the leaders, thoughts going into the weekend?
DANNY CHIA: Try to finish well for the year.  I haven't done much this year.  Again, I just try to go out there and try to enjoy my last event of the year.
Q. Do you feel like you have a shot at challenging on Sunday?
DANNY CHIA: We'll see.  Putts start to drop; if I putt as good as these first two days, I think I will have a decent chance.
