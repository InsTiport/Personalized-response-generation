 Q.  Talk about how it went today compared to yesterday.  
DANNY CHIA: Pretty much identical.  Yesterday, I didn't get off to a very good start.  Hit quite a lot of good shots and then just got unlucky there.   
Then I recovered well today and came in under par.  Just got to try to get through the -- as I said, 11, 12, 13 holes.  I think if I can get through those holes well, I think I'm in for a good scoring day.  At the moment, I'm not doing that, so hopefully, tomorrow will be a good day.   
 Q.  Your game plan for tomorrow?  
DANNY CHIA: Same thing.  I've been hitting a lot of good shots like today -- just I hit one shot off the target and at 14, I hit a pretty good second shot, but it was a half a meter of being perfect, and I end up in the water and made double bogey.   
So, hopefully tomorrow will be a good day for me.   
 Q.  You've played those two holes that you talked about on the back nine.  Do you have a plan for that heading into the last round?  
DANNY CHIA: I'm not really a long hitter, so there's not no different plan for me.  There's only one way for me, I just try to hit a lot of good shots through those holes and hopefully, I get through them.  Yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
DANNY CHIA: Yeah, I always felt like I could have done better, if not because of those holes, but I can't complain much.  Every day I think I recovered quite well to come back under par.  So I just need to do better tomorrow.   
 Q.  Consecutive 71 today, do you have a number in mind for tomorrow?  
DANNY CHIA: I would be really happy with 5- or 6-under tomorrow, yeah.
