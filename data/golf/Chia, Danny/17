 Q.   Are you happy with your round?  
DANNY CHIA:   It's okay.   I mean the back nine I'm kind of more a bit relaxed with my thought and swinging a bit more freely.   So I hit quite a few good shots.  
   
 Q.   Birdies game today?  
DANNY CHIA:   Finally, you know.   Really, I just thinking like how many birdies am I going to get for this week, and okay, the back nine I played quite decently.   So I had three birdies on the back nine, yeah.  
   
 Q.   You had a double just before you came in, I suppose?  
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah.   We were just talking about the rough this week, and you know, my right arm is not strong enough and stuff like that, and it proved it.   Last hole I drove it in the rough, just off the fairway in rough and I tried my best to just hack it back to the fairway, and I just couldn't.   Kept getting it in the rough and just couldn't come out of the rough.  
   
 Q.   What's the mindset going into the final round?  
DANNY CHIA:   I'm pretty much at the bottom, so there's really nothing to lose here.   I mean tomorrow I'll maybe try to be slightly more aggressive in some of the holes, and then especially with the putt, you know, just try to hit them firm, because I think this week the greens is a bit slow as well, so yeah.  
   
 Q.   What's the difference today in terms of the birdies?  
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, actually.   Just before I went out this morning, I just told myself I have to hit it firm, I have to give it a lot of hit on the putt, because the first two days I think I'm just very tentative with the putt.  
   
 Q.   You're gradually improving day by day.   That must be one of the positives that you can take into the last round, isn't it?  
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, it is.   It is.   I'm feeling better going into the last round that hopefully I can shoot some good score, yeah.
