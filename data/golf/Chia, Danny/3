 Q.  Thoughts on the round today?  
DANNY CHIA: I've been hitting okay.  Just not getting the speed good on my putting today.  I think that's probably why there's a lot of lip-outs and stuff.  I think overall, I did all right.  I think I hit a lot of good shots.  Just mainly I think I lose it on the green today.   
 Q.  Seems to be the story of Team Asia, the putting this week?  
DANNY CHIA: Yeah, the speed, it changes every day, so it's kind of a bit different.  It's not easy to judge them.  Especially I think mainly Team Asia is a bit more nervous in terms of this experience and this format of play.   
Again, this is a great event for us to gain experience to play against these guys.  These guys are good, so you don't get a lot of easy matches out there.  Every single match is tough.   
 Q.  Talk about the experience of your first EurAsia Cup.  
DANNY CHIA: It was great.  I actually quite enjoyed myself here this week.  You know, get to play against these big boys.  It's fun.  I'm happy with everything that's been going.  I think Jeev and Liang have done a good job leading the Asia team this week.   
 Q.  Is this the sort of tournament that can help your career and make you a better player?  
DANNY CHIA: It will in terms of experience, because I mean, you know, in Asia, we don't get to play this kind of format very often, especially at this level.
