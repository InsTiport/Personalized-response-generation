Q. Last day must have been satisfying, was it?
DANNY CHIA: It was great.  I was hitting the ball quite solid.  Putting was great today.  So very happy with it, yeah.
Q. Probably a Top-10 to finish off the year.  A nice way to finish the year after a tough 2016.
DANNY CHIA: It would have been nice, a nice way to end the year for me.  Actually I hope it just started because I just start to hit the ball decent again.  But anyway, next month it starts again.
Q. Will the short break, will you be having a rest or what will you be doing?
DANNY CHIA: I was thinking about it at one stage to stop for a while, but since I start hitting the ball solid again, I think I'm back to practice.  There will be no off for me.
Q. But obviously you found something back in your game to give you the kind of confidence?
DANNY CHIA: As I say, early on it's more about a bit of technical stuff in my backswing.  I think once I got that, I was pretty confident where my ball is going and where I'm missing it.  That makes a whole lot of difference, yeah.
Q. You set yourself goals for new year, new things to achieve in 2017?
DANNY CHIA: I didn't set any goal but I think I'm quite confident to say I will do well, because as I said, I found this.  I got good swing thought now and just stick with it for a while, so I should be doing quite well, yeah.
