 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
DANNY CHIA: It wasn't really a great ball striking day today.  I managed to scramble quite well today.  I holed some good putt.  Pretty happy with 1-under.   
 Q.  Are you able to put your finger on the ball striking?  
DANNY CHIA: Yeah, I would say so.  I think that I didn't really focus very well today on most of my shots today, I just, I don't know, it's just like I feel I'm day dreaming on the golf course, I don't know what I'm doing.  But as I say, never the less, I scrambled quite well today and I'm very happy to come back with 1-under par.   
 Q.  Were the conditions out there for good low round?  
DANNY CHIA: I would say so.  I think that if you hit to 10 feet you got a very good reasonable birdie chance.  And I wasn't, I just wasn't hitting enough greens today.   
 Q.  What do you think you need to do better tomorrow?  
DANNY CHIA: Hit the ball better.   
 Q.  Are you surprised to see 10-under score leading around here on day one?  
DANNY CHIA: Not really.  I always thought this golf course is always quite a big advantage for guys who hit it quite far.  And as I said this week the rough, it wasn't that long, it's going to be a pretty good scoring week here.
