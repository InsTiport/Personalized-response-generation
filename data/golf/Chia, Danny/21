Q.   Thoughts on the day?
DANNY CHIA:   Hit some bad shots but still give myself a lot of birdie opportunity.   It's okay. 

Q.   What was good in your round today? 
DANNY CHIA:   My short putt was pretty solid today, because actually I got a bit of a problem judging the green speed.   A lot of my putts are like four feet past, five feet past, and I'm making the return putts, so that's good, yeah. 

Q.   Considering what happened, good result for the first round? 
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah. 

Q.   How has your record been on this golf course?   Has it been a good place for you? 
DANNY CHIA:   It's okay.   It's always been a golf course that you really need to stay patient, and hit a lot of good iron shots here actually.   This year I think they have grown the rough a little bit, and so hit the fairways to give yourself an opportunity to hit the green is very important. 

Q.   Game seems to be gradually improving?
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, I've been more consistent now.   Been hitting a lot of fairway and greens.   Still the main priority for me, hopefully I can get back all my strength and body condition is what I'm concentrating at the moment.

Q.   Are you still feeling not 100 per cent healthy? 
DANNY CHIA:   Just I get tired really quick on my right shoulder, like especially when I'm facing like two, three weeks in a row stress and I'll get really weak on my right shoulder.   That's the only thing I worry about actually.

Q.   Do you practise less during tournament weeks? 
DANNY CHIA:   Less, actually I do a bit more putting and chipping.   But don't spend so much time hitting.
