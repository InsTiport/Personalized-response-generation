Q.   Has it been frustrating today?
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah.   Wasn't swinging it great today, but didn't manage to make any putts at all the whole day today.   So there's still a lot of room to improve for tomorrow.

Q.   This must be run of the rare occasions you don't have a birdie at all today?
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, thinking about it.   Probably it's been a long time, I believe.   Yeah.

Q.   How was the course playing?
DANNY CHIA:   It's wet.   I mean the rough is really thick, so I mean I didn't‑‑ I didn't think it was that bad, and I just missed a few shots and I didn't make any putts.
So I think the course is playing quite tough this week.

Q.   Your strength, was that an issue out there?
DANNY CHIA:   Mainly in the rough.   I mean I'm not as strong as I used to for the time being, so a lot of time I'm in the rough I'm struggling to hit the ball near the green, so that leads to a few bogeys. 

Q.   You up for the next three days?
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, definitely.   I just have to drive a little bit better.   My driving was off today, so I just have to drive a little bit better, and some putts start to drop, I might get in the right spot.

Q.   Will you go to the driving range to do some work?
DANNY CHIA:   Yeah, going to, but try not to hit too many balls.
