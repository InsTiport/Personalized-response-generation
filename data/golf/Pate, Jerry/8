Q.
Talk about your round.
JERRY PATE:  I got 18 more to play and I'm playing well.  Just sink a few putts.  If things go my way, I should be in good shape.
Q.  You're minus 6, it looks great.  Very close to the leader?
JERRY PATE:  Yeah, yes.  I think it's just a matter of just going out there and playing one shot at a time.

Hitting the green    fairways, greens and sink a putt here or there.  Just play consistent.
