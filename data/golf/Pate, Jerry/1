 Q.   With Jerry Pate.   Jerry, thank you for your time.   Can you fill us in a little bit about your round today, pluses and minuses in your mind, I guess.   
JERRY PATE:   Well, I played very well.   I had it 4 under par on 16.   I hit really well.   It wasn't that bad of a tee shot, but it got in one of the deep bunkers.   I made 6.   Ball stayed in the bunker.  
Made 6 on 16, and I hit a really good drive on 18 and hit the wrong club, came up just short, three‑putted and made bogey.   So that was my only two, 6 on 16 and 5 on 18 and four birdies.   So pretty consistent round.  
   
 Q.   For sure.   In terms of goals, obviously, you're in the hunt, in the pack.   Is that what you wanted to do, getting out on day one here?   
JERRY PATE:   Shoot as low as you can and play one shot at a time, and hopefully you're the low scorer at the end.   That's all you can do, play your best.  
   
 Q.   A lot has been said about the importance of keeping the ball on the fairway on this golf course and out of the heather.   Were you happy with the way you drove it today?   
JERRY PATE:   Well, it's actually fescue.   There's no heather.   And it's a tall fescue.   But yeah, I drove the ball well.   I hit the ball, as I said, I hit it just a little right on 16 and paid the severe penalty for it.   I was in a very deep bunker, the last bunker on the corner.  
Other than that, I played well.   Drove it right in the fairway perfect.   Probably about 310 on the last hole and had 160 yards and just hit‑‑ really should have hit one more club.   Came up short.  
   
 Q.   There's 160‑some bunkers out here.   So maybe one is not too bad when it's all considered?  
JERRY PATE:   Yeah, not bad.  
   
 Q.   Thank you so much.   Good luck tomorrow.   
JERRY PATE:   Thanks.
