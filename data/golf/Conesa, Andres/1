  Q. So just talk a little about the experience, what was it like to be inside the ropes for four days?   
 ANDRES CONESA: It was a great experience, something that you don't change. I mean, obviously she would like to have a better round today, but she leaves very happy and it was a great experience for both of us, for me and her.  
  
  Q. So what's harder, being Lorena's caddie or CEO?   
 ANDRES CONESA: This for sure.
