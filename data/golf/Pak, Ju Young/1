 Q.   Before you start playing today, did you receive any advice and consultation from your sister?  
JU YOUNG PAK:   When I was walking around the official golf course with my sister, she gave a lot of lessons and also how to address the certain play.   That was a big help.  
   
 Q.   First of all, congratulations on your good performance in the first round.   What was the biggest help and advice from your sister?   I saw you played with your sister and your sister made fun of you.   And so what I want to know is what was really helpful when you were with your sister?  
JU YOUNG PAK:   First of all, the coach management styles between the two of us are totally different.   For me, I always take a good look at the grass shape, the point I need to be aggressive.   But my sister, she is always concentrating on parts and areas where she should be defensive.   
So since both of us are totally different from that point, I take a lesson from the differences.  
   
 Q.   Did you receive any specific advice for you to address the specific holes?  
JU YOUNG PAK:   For example, she said that for the par‑3, I should focus on the center of the green.   That's what she said and that was really helpful.   
As for par‑5s, I shouldn't be always aggressive.   She advised me to use wedge shot.   That was really helpful.   So using wedge shot create some sort of spin in the ball.   That is the advice from my sister and also that was very helpful.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any specific method and strategy to address this course?   Let us know your own know how to address this course.   
JU YOUNG PAK:   It is most important to keep the tee shot in the fairway.
