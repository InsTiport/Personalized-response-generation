CHAN KIM: I think I've learned a lot, where I am mentally and how to manage the course, and just to stay more aggressive.  And aggressive doesn't always mean that you're picking aggressive lines or whatnot.  You can pick conservative lines, I just have to be aggressive to those target lines.  Yeah, I think I've done a pretty good job so far.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I mean I would say at least seven.  Yeah, just to stay more aggressive.  We stepped up on tees and thought, okay, let's hit an iron and try and be safe.  And it almost actually gets me in trouble because I'm not swinging like I want to.  So, yeah, I'd say about seven.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I mean, if I can get close enough, I'm going to try and do it, depending on which hole it is and what's around the greens.  But, yeah, I mean, if I can get one down there, I feel like I have a better chance of making birdies, especially with all the wind.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I can't really say.  I can't really remember.  I feel like I should have hit driver on 10.  That's the only hole where I tried to hit 3-wood and tried to play it safe, but I feel like I should have hit the driver, because I knew I could get it up there.  But, yeah, I can't give you an exact number.   
 Q.  When is the last time you played in weather like this?  
CHAN KIM: That's a great question.  I guess back home in Arizona when we have dust storms, but we don't have rain, so that's good.  But the wind is pretty strong.  So I would say maybe about a month and a half ago.   
 Q.  What's easier to play in, dust storm or rain?  
CHAN KIM: At least in the rain you can see, you know, and when the dust starts hitting your eyes, you can't really see anything.  And we have like safety warnings and air pollution warnings.  So definitely the rain is a lot easier.   
 Q.  Who is following you this week?  
CHAN KIM: I have my parents - both my parents, my mom, my dad - and my caddie, Stephen, is actually a real good friend of mine from Arizona.  And he flew out here to caddie for me.   
 Q.  What is his last name?  
CHAN KIM: D-e-g-u-a-r-d-i.   
 Q.  And S-t-e-v-e-n?  
CHAN KIM: P-h.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: So my parents and I and Stephen were all in one house.  It's a two bedroom with a loft.  So it actually worked out pretty nice.  But, yeah, I think it cost three thousand pounds, so it's not too bad.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, hopefully with some good food and a nice hot meal, and try and get some sleep before tomorrow.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, it's so different.  I mean, you know, you have to play so many creative shots.  There's so many different shots that you can hit into greens.  It's not get a number and try and fly it on to that number.  I mean, honestly every hole when you're going into the greens, you could hit anything from a pitching wedge to a 7-iron and roll one up there.  I think it's just interesting and it's actually a lot of fun.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Feels pretty good.  After I won Sega Sammy, I had told them that this is something that I wanted to represent the Japan Golf Tour really well.  And I hoped that I can keep playing well throughout the weekend so -- yeah, but that was my goal.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I think it all started with the sectional qualifying for the U.S. Open.  Going into the playoff and getting through I think boosted my confidence a lot.  And that kind of led into Mizuno.  And after winning Mizuno, I felt like my game has gotten a lot better.  And I think it's just confidence from playing well.  And obviously winning at Sega Sammy again, that just kind of reassured me that I can play out here.  So, yeah, it's just definitely the confidence.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: As of right now, I mean I've played some junior golf with Jordan.  And obviously it's at a whole different stage.  But these guys are good.  And if I want a chance to win, then I'm going to have to make quite a few birdies in the next two rounds unless the weather gets really bad like today, then a few under par each will do.  But, yeah, I'm going to give it my best.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Actually the most memorable one was when we played the Canon Cup.  I don't know if it's called the Canon Cup anymore now, but in 2008 I was playing in Connecticut.  He was my alternate shot partner, which was pretty awesome.  He's an awesome partner to have for an alternate shot, for how accurate he hits it.  It takes pressure off of me.  So it was a good time.   
 Q.  What year was that?  
CHAN KIM: 2008.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yes, we did, yeah.  That is the important part, absolutely.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yes, so I think I have to stay aggressive to give myself a chance.  If I play too conservative, I mean some of these guys are just going to run away with it.  So I'll definitely try and stay aggressive.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: That would be -- yeah, that would be a blast.  I think it would be a great experience for me.  Obviously as accomplished a player as he is, I think I could definitely learn some things from him to help my game a little bit.  Yeah, it would be amazing.
