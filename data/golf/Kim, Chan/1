CHAN KIM: It was a lot of fun.  I actually used to watch Ernie in the Sony Open back in like 2004, 2005 when I was living in Hawaii as a junior.  And I actually got to play a practise round with him, was it on Monday?  And then to be paired with him again, it was a really good experience.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, he did, yeah.  We played on Monday, so like on hole No. 6 he told me that -- just to hit driver and get it over the bunker.  And when I pulled driver on 6 and I hit a good drive on 6 today, so that's what he was talking about, just hit the driver and take advantage of the length.  So that was a good time.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I don't know.  He still hits it pretty long.  Obviously I'm a lot younger, but like on I guess hole 17 I think I got him by probably about 40 yards.  But I think on average I was only about 15 yards ahead of him.  Yeah, he still hits it pretty long.   
 Q.  I think the biggest thing is just to stay patient, just like I have for the last three days.  And be patient but be aggressive.  Don't be so tentative over shots and really make sure that I pick good lines and stay aggressive to those lines.  Yeah, that's my game plan for tomorrow.  
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I would have to say short game, just a lot of getting up and down from short side, if I get short sided.  My bunker game has been good this week.  I think I'm maybe a hundred percent out of the bunkers, so that always helps.  And the putting, a lot of the light putting and the mid range putts, if you can make a few of those you're going to shoot a good number.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yes, I'm using the G-400.  I've had it since the U.S. Open and I used it actually at Sega Sammy.  So, yeah, it's a driver that I really like.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, it's good.  I mean I can launch it low if I want to, I can launch it high if I want to.  The ball speed's a lot faster off of it.  But I just like the way how it sounds and how it feels.  It just gives me more confidence.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: I guess the three years of playing Mizuno Open and playing at the Chambers Bay in 2010 for U.S. Amateur, that's about it.  That's about the only times I've ever played links golf courses.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, first time ever playing a real links golf course.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous.  Final round, with one round to go in a major championship it's very, very nerve wracking.  But I'm also excited about it so I think it kind of takes the nervousness away a little bit.  But, yeah, it's definitely still there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Basically they just told me to play how I've been playing in the last three days and just stay confident and they said the biggest thing is just stay patient, especially the final round of a major championship.  They said you never know what's going to happen, just stay really, really patient and you should be all right.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: That's tough to say because I think the style of golf here on a links golf course is completely different.  But -- and because so many guys hit it long out here.  You look at Dustin Johnson and Jason Day and Rory, all these guys hit it long.  But to carry it over some of these bunkers that make the fairway a little bit narrower is a pretty big advantage.   
 Q.  Is it fun chasing down the leader (inaudible)?  
CHAN KIM: We played some junior golf together in the American Junior Golf Association, this was back in 2008.  He hit it great then and he hits it great now.  And he's always been a great putter.  He was kind of one of those guys that you look at him and you're like, wow, he's really going to be good.  And here he is.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, it's nice to see people that I've known for a while.  I know some of these guys may not remember me, hopefully they will after this week.  But, yeah, I mean the advice -- the players are really friendly out here.  They're not afraid to give you advice and say, hey, this may be the better play; test it out.  Like when I played with Ernie actually in a practise round earlier on in the week, he told me to hit driver on a couple of holes I didn't think I should have hit driver.  And it's really helping when I'm playing my rounds.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHAN KIM: Yeah, absolutely.  It's a matter of just trying to keep my confidence up, absolutely.
