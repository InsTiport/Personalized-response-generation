  Q. Do you want to just start off talking about the round today, and obviously the wind was real high and how happy you are to get it in?  
 KENT JONES: Yeah, I was happy with the round. It was definitely a little windier today. Sometimes you think you're going to get up in the morning and it's not going to be as bad. But it was windier this morning than I think it's been all week. It maybe played a little tougher, but I was definitely happy.   
 I didn't do anything spectacular but played solid. I was really good on my short putts and birdied the three par-5s, so I think that's kind of the key to the round. I only hit it in the hazard one time, so kept it in play for most of the day.  
  
  Q. Did you come out expecting to shoot this kind of score today?  
 KENT JONES: I don't know if I expected it, but I was pretty confident. I felt good about where I was at. I feel like I've been practicing well. I felt good this week. You know, I haven't been shooting good scores really, but I haven't felt bad about my game. I mean, I like this course. I feel good about coming here.  
  
  Q. If I remember right, you played well before here?  
 KENT JONES: I've played okay, but it's just a fun course.  
  
  Q. Something about the course that sets up good to your eye?  
 KENT JONES: Not so much. I just think it's a good course. It's the kind of course that fits anybody's game. You can be a long player -- if you can hit it straight you have a big advantage, so you don't have to be long to play this course. You just have to play solid, keep it in play. It's just straightforward and it's a fun course.
