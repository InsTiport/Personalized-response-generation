  PETE KOWALSKI:   The choice was a tough one.   I mean, you qualified for two USGA championships in two days.   What was your reason?   
SEAN KNAPP:   What was the reason for trying?   
PETE KOWALSKI:   For choosing the Senior Open.   
SEAN KNAPP:   Well, I think that it's ‑‑ I've played on two Pub Links.   I've played in 33 USGA events.   I can honestly say that this is exactly what I anticipated.   It's something different.   It's a step above.   It's like the amateur later, in later rounds, and anticipating that, I just thought that this was the proper venue to go to.   
I absolutely despise giving up a USGA event, an opportunity, but at the end of the day, when you got to choose, this is the one I chose, and hopefully I made the right decision.  
   
 Q.   Similar demographic too, right?   
SEAN KNAPP:   What's that?  
   
 Q.   Well, you played against 50s, not 20s.   
SEAN KNAPP:   Well, you know, that's true.   But I'd like to say that there's probably a lot more talent here, all due respect.   There's a reason why guys like Fred Couples and Tom Watson were number one in the world.   And some of those kids that are out there, they may attain that someday, but right now, even though these guys are older, they can flat‑out play.  
PETE KOWALSKI:   Perfect.   Thank you, Sean.   Congratulations.
