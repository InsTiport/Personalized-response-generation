 Q.   How nice was it is to be able to, one, to finish up and take advantage of these conditions?  
    JOE DURANT:   It was nice to finish for one thing.   That was kind of our goal at the turn, we wanted to get done.   As you can see the wind is not blowing at all.   We definitely had the nice end of the draw once the weather came and went, kind of took the energy out of air and there was virtually no wind the rest of the day.   It was cool, real cool for here.  
   
 Q.   You like this finishing up and your position now going into the next day?  
    JOE DURANT:   Yeah, to be done and to know we're going to start tomorrow and get a little more sleep, you know, for an old guy like me, I don't mind getting a few more winks.  
   
 Q.   I know that feeling.  
    JOE DURANT:   I'm not a morning person.  
   
 Q.   But here you talk about how --  
    JOE DURANT:   I've usually played here pretty well.   I love coming here.   It's just a golf course that suits -- someone that hits a lot of fairways and greens.   A very challenging course since they went to bermuda.   It's tough.   
    You got to play from Point A to Point B well here and the back-9, there's a lot of risk/reward type shots and a lot of danger.   
   
 Q.   How did you like the 7-under?  
    JOE DURANT:   Ben played solid.   Maybe one time he might have been in jeopardy of making a bogey, made a par out of it.   Other than that he played great today.   Yeah, it was fun to watch.
