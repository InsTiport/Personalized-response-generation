Q. Six bogeys yesterday and none today.
JOE DURANT: Yeah, yeah.
Q. What adjustment did you make today?
JOE DURANT: Oh, I just -- I didn't hit it very good yesterday, and I was chipping half the day.  I just tried to settle down, just hit some fairways and greens.  I wasn't overly aggressive with a lot of my iron shots.  I just tried to give myself some opportunities.
And that's basically all I did.  I putted beautifully.  I made three or four really good up and downs today, which you're going to have to do to have a bogey-free round.
Q. Course conditions today.  You guys played in the majority of the breeze yesterday and same sort of breeze this morning as well.
JOE DURANT: The greens were softer today, though.  The greens got really firm yesterday afternoon.  It was tough to control the ball once they hit the ground.  Today, you could be a little more sure that it was going to stop.  And it wasn't as hard until the last three or four holes.  But the one benefit was it was the same direction, so that kind of helps.  At least you know how the holes are going to play.
Q. 2 over heading into the weekend.  Looking like it's not going to be that far back.  What's your thoughts?
JOE DURANT: My caddie and I said our goal was to kind of chip away at it.  Just to keep fighting our way back towards even par.  Did a good job of that today.  Just keep doing that the next couple days.
Q. Good round today.  Good luck.
JOE DURANT: Thanks.
