  JOE DURANT:   Yeah, I played well.   I got off to a nice start and then just kind of hit the doldrums.   I couldn't make a putt.   10 through 14 I had some good opportunities and didn't make any of them, and then the bogey on 15 didn't help, either.  
   
 Q.   What happened on 15?  
JOE DURANT:   I pushed my drive a little bit and there was a big stone just on the right edge of the fairway and it hit the stone and came back about 80 yards, so I had to lay up.  
   
 Q.   In a way that kind of saved you, though, if you'd have been in the rough over there‑‑  
JOE DURANT: Yeah, could have been worse, absolutely.   I just knew I was going to have to make a putt for a par because I just didn't have much of a second shot, really.   That's a hard hole.   You need to hit the fairway there, and I didn't.   
   
 Q.   You had three solid rounds.   Yesterday was a little shaky, but‑‑  
JOE DURANT:   Yeah, yesterday was a little shaky.   I didn't quite have the speed on the greens yesterday with a little bit of wind blowing, but today I played really well.   I hit a lot of really good iron shots on the front.   Like I said, in the middle of the round I couldn't seem to keep things going, and I knew I had to, and I just didn't quite do it.   
   
 Q.   Looks like you jumped to 29.   
JOE DURANT:   Yeah, I'm going to have to play good again next week.  
   
 Q.   At least you're inside now.   Better than being on the outside looking in.   
JOE DURANT:   Yeah, I'm playing well.   If I just play well‑‑ I like the golf course, just a nice, solid week.
