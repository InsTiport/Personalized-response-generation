Q. Great round, 4-under and you probably left some out there from what I understand.JOE DURANT: I played very well.  I had a clean card today which is always nice.  Made one good save on No. 9.  I left a few out there but I just hit a really -- lot of really good shots.Q. Your fairways, I don't think you missed one today.JOE DURANT: Drove it beautifully today.  That sets everything up here.  If you don't hit it in the fairway it's a constant battle.  I drove it good, hit a lot of good solid iron shots and seemed to have good numbers today, too.  I didn't have to try to manufacture shots.  The wind was down a little bit.Q. I bet your buddy Hal set up to it.JOE DURANT: Couldn't have been better.Q. What did you do on 15 center?JOE DURANT: 15, I hilt a 3-wood.  I ripped it.  I killed it but it flew into the bank and stuck and trickled back down.  I had a tough pitch.  Hit a good shot, came up a little short.  Got on the green, little short, missed the putt. That's an interesting set-up because it's an awkward number.  Driver was going to go way through and couldn't get there with 3-wood.Q. Realistically if you would have made them all, what would you have --JOE DURANT: I don't know.  Two, three more, probably, being realistic about it.  I had a lot of good looks.  Hit a lot of good putts.Q. Did you like it?JOE DURANT: This week was absolutely fantastic.  Thank the people here at Oak Tree enough for the hospitality and unbelievable facility, great set-up.  The whole week was fantastic
