 Q.  Joe, 69 good score out on a tough golf course in these conditions today. 
 JOE DURANT:  Yeah, I tried to stay real patient today.  There's just some flags you can't aim at.  The par-3s are tough here with the wind.  The greens are firm and pretty quick, so that combination of things makes it pretty difficult to shoot a good number. 

 Q.  Even on 17 with the tee up like that, front left hole location, it's just one of those things you can't fire at. 
 JOE DURANT:  I was bailing out way right, and I hit it farther right than I was aiming.  But you can't go left of that hole, and there's about three or four out here that you can't wrong-side it at all or else you're going to pay a big penalty. 

 Q.  Tell me a little bit about how the course is playing out there today. 
 JOE DURANT:  I played the Pro-Am yesterday afternoon, and it really dried out, and the greens were pretty fast.  Then when I got out there today, starting out they were a little slower and a little softer, but six holes into it the wind kicked up, and after that the moisture was gone and it was pretty much right back to where it was yesterday afternoon.  It's a challenging golf course. 

 Q.  And with the wind blowing the way it is, you've got to expect that the greens are just going to keep getting firmer and faster. 
 JOE DURANT:  Yeah, I don't anticipate them putting a lot of water on them between now and Sunday, so it's quite a test.
