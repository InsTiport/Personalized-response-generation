Q. Take us through your round.
JOE DURANT: Had perfect conditions out there today.  Really, it was nice, a little bit of wind.  All in all, played very solid.  I birdied par 3, No. 3 and 4 out of the gate.  So I was 2 under early, and then made another birdie on the par 5, No. 6, I guess it is.  So I played the front really solid.
One little hiccup on 11.  I missed the green left and didn't get up and down, so made bogey there.  That was the only bogey of the day.  But then made a good birdie on 14 and 16.  So all the rest pars, but real solid, played good.
Q. What do you think going into tomorrow?  How do you feel?
JOE DURANT: I feel good.  You know, I'm hitting the ball a lot better than I've been hitting it.  Fortunately, I played with Mike Small yesterday, and he saw a little something in my golf swing that didn't look right to him.  We've been friends for a long time.
Hit it a lot more solid than I'd been hitting it.  If I can continue to do that, it will be fun.
