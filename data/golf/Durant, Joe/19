  Q. 4-under 67, great start to the week, can you just talk about the round today?  
 JOE DURANT: We had a little bit of a delay to start. We had about an hour delay, but once we got going, it was perfect conditions for us. We had very little wind, and the greens were receptive and they were rolling good.   
 So it was out there and there some good scores that obviously proved that.   
  
  Q. Heard you talking to your caddie, slow and steady today, anything flashy happening or solid golf?  
 JOE DURANT: I made a couple of good up-and-downs early but other than that I played very solid. This golf course kind of rewards that, if you're steady and give yourself a lot of opportunities; you don't have to do a lot of fancy things around here. Just good, steady golf seems to do very well.  
  
  Q. Great start, thoughts on moving forward here for the rest of the week?  
 JOE DURANT: I love playing here. This is one of my favorite courses we play all year. So I'm excited about tomorrow.
