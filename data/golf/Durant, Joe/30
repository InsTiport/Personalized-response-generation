   JOE DURANT: It's been a long time since I made one. I can remember when I made it, but I don't know how long ago it was. Gosh, 6 or 7 years ago probably.   
 I was a little stunned. I hit a good shot. It was going to be close, but for it to go in involves a little bit of luck obviously.  
  
  Q. What did you hit?  
 JOE DURANT: 8-iron. It was like 147 to the hole, which for me was kind of an in-between shot. I hit a nice little smooth 8-iron and hit about four feet past and drew back in.   
  
  Q. Were you relieved to get through your round tonight?  
 JOE DURANT: Yes. We were running the last couple holes to try to get done. It'll be nice to sleep in.
