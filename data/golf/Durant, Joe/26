  Q. A week ago if I said second place, would you have taken it?  
 JOE DURANT: Yeah, i would have. But being in the position I was in, I'm disappointed. I didn't play well today. Cameron played a great round. It was tough. I didn't have it. I tried. I gutted it out the best that I could, but I came up short.   
  
  Q. What can you take out of the whole thing? This was a terrific performance.  
 JOE DURANT: There is certainly margin for improvement. There's plenty of things to work on always. When you go out and prove to yourself you can still play halfway decent, I think I did that this week. I need to keep working, and hopefully go to Phoenix and do it all over again.   
  
  Q. How aware were you of the situation and that the Cameron was making a run? That was looking at the scoreboard on 15.   
 JOE DURANT: Well, the reason is because I was almost underneath it. I hit a bad shot and I saw he was -14. I assumed from the roar of the crowd, sounded like he birdied 17. I think he did. I knew I was two behind. I was trying to hole it. It wasn't a good shot.   
  
  Q. Thanks for your time.  
 JOE DURANT: Thanks.
