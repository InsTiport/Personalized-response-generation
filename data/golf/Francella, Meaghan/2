   JASON TAYLOR: 4-under and two back right now for the lead. You have got to be happy with how it went today.
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA: Yeah, definitely. I definitely -- considering how I've been starting the last couple weeks, you know, shooting 2-over and putting myself kind of behind the eight ball, it felt really good to get a solid round under my belt.
 JASON TAYLOR: You were in the earlier group today and you have a good part of the day left. What do you do now? 
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA: I'm going to eat lunch and go back rest, because I am exhausted. This morning, 5:45 came really fast. It's been a long week, long travel from the east coast.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA: I'm just going to do the same thing I've been doing: Just stay patient and one shot at a time. I have a lot of short irons in my hand, which is my strong point. 
 So just kind of continue to hit the shots that I'm seeing in my head and pick good shots on the greens and stroke it. Hopefully they go in. They went in today.

 Q. Started off a little chilly today. 
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA: Oh, yeah. 

 Q. And it's kind of warm out there now. The course has got to be in pretty good shape. 
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA: It's in perfect shape, yeah. The greens are rolling so well. You know, the golf course, I think, is playing great. A lot of good scoring holes out there. 
 But then you got to put the ball in the right position on the greens, and also in the fairway. If you don't put it in the fairway you're going to have a tough shot out of the rough. I only missed one fairway and it was, I think -- no, I don't think I missed a fairway today. I made every fairway.
