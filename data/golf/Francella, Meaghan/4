  Q.  How much fun has it been this week?   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  It's been great.  Just really playing some good golf and you know, hopefully I can get some more putts to go in this afternoon.   
  
  Q.  How has it been, being so close to home and so many people supporting you?   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  It's been great.  Looking forward to seeing how many people come out here this afternoon.   
  
  Q.  What would it mean to put together a nice round here?   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  Yeah, it would be great.  I'm going to take it one hole at a time, one step at a time.  I have a tough match again this afternoon.  I'm going to see what happens.   
  
  Q.  Either way, it's been an unforgettable experience.   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  Absolutely.  It's been incredible, and I'm just glad so many people could be out here.   
  
  Q.  When did you think it turned with Pat?   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  On 13 I hit a great shot in there and made birdie, just a big 3-wood in there and just knocked it up real tight.   
  
  Q.  That's been working for you this week, the magical club.   
 MEAGHAN FRANCELLA:  It's been good.
