   DOUG MILNE:  Just some general comments about your round? 
 DAISUKE MARUYAMA:  Everything was great today, besides one bunker shot, but everything else was working good. 
 In particular, the driver and irons are working very well. 

 Q.  How about the course, what do you think about the course? 
 DAISUKE MARUYAMA:  It's a little tight course, so you need very accurate shots. 

 Q.  And you're at 8-under, tied for the lead now, which may or may not hold up.  Going into the weekend, will you change your game plan? 
 DAISUKE MARUYAMA:  I don't want to change any game plans.  I just would like to continue what I was doing. 

 Q.  What's been the best part of your game the past few weeks?  What are you most happy with? 
 DAISUKE MARUYAMA:  Going into the Fall Series, I'm ranked 174th or something, and my feeling is I want to continue progressively go for pins and be more positive about the results. 

 Q.  The Fall Series is very valuable for a lot of guys trying to get into the Top-125.  Kent Jones was 239th and now he's like 130th.  Are you finding that valuable, and are you going to keep playing through the rest of the year? 
 DAISUKE MARUYAMA:  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want to give up.
