 Q.   Talk about your overall experience and how you played.   
BOB SOWARDS:   I played terrible yesterday, the front nine.   The first six holes I was 4â€‘over and then I started playing all right.   Today it's just tough out there.   It's brutal and teeing off at 7:30, theoretically it's a better tee time but it was a worse tee time.   We couldn't even see the ball land it was raining so hard.   I played better today but just a lot tougher conditions.   
   
 Q.   What do you take away from this week?  
BOB SOWARDS:   I take way a lot of fun.   It's great playing out here.   Obviously I wish I could have played better.   But the course fits my game.   I just started so bad yesterday.   You know, I take away a lot.   It gives me a lot of confidence.   I can't wait to get to Philadelphia Cricket Club next year and try to qualify again.
