 BOB SOWARDS:   As far as playing goes, I figured if I could hit fairways, I could play out here.  But I hit ten fairways.  I figure if I hit ten fairways a day, I would make the cut and be around even.  But I shot 81 and I hit ten fairways. 

Q.  Is the rough just that tough?
BOB SOWARDS:   I was missing greens from the middle of the fairways, which is something that I never do.  Maybe because I'm playing in a bigger tournament.  And I didn't putt it well, either.  I drove it in the fairway, which is normally my weakness.  Turned out completely opposite of the way I normally play. 

Q.  Did the greens get harder as the day went on?
BOB SOWARDS:   It didn't really matter.  I'm sure they will get hard by the weekend.  But, oh, well.
