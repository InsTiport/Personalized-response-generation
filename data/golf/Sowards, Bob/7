 Q.   Just talk a little about your round today.   
BOB SOWARDS:   I was hitting it right today.   I don't know whether it was practicing a lot on the range in a straight‑left wind or aiming everything to the right, but I was hitting everything consistently ten yards right with every club.   So got to figure that out.   
   
 Q.   How do you think the course played different this afternoon versus this morning?  
BOB SOWARDS:   Well, I mean, I don't know, I wasn't out here this morning, but it's just a hard golf course.   I'm looking forward to getting out here at 7:30 hopefully with not much wind.   So it will be a little more playable.   
   
 Q.   You've been in a bunch of these, this is not your first PGA Championship.   How has this one been different than the others?   
BOB SOWARDS:   It's different because it's tough for spectators to be out there, so you don't see a lot of spectators, pretty much, ever.   And playing by the ocean, you're dealing with who knows what if you miss‑hit one, as opposed to just deep rough, which makes it interesting.   Sometimes you get some breaks, sometimes you don't.   
I love it here.
