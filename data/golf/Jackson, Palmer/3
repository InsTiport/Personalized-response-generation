Q. Real quick, big chip-in there.
PALMER JACKSON: Yeah.
Q. Tell mow about how you're feeling right now.
PALMER JACKSON: I feel great.  I played okay all day.  Michael didn't play his best obviously.  I knew I had to make that chip because he had a 5-footer for birdie and he's making those all day.
Feels really good to take him out.
Q. Yeah, the defending champ.
PALMER JACKSON: Yeah.
Q. Little bit back and forth throughout the round; 1-up on 17.  What was your mindset going into 18 and what you had to do?
PALMER JACKSON: Yeah, just trying to get it in the fairway, which I didn't do, but I knew I probably at least had to make a par, probably a birdie, to halve the hole.
He was hitting driver and going to make birdie most of the time.  I really just tried to play my own game and play for three or four, and it worked out.
Q. On to the final 16.  How are you feeling going into the afternoon?
PALMER JACKSON: I feel really good.  Going to go rest because it's going to get hot.  I am going to drink some of water.
But you take down the defending champ, who knows what you can do.  Feel really good.
