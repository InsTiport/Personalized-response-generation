 Q.  Tell us about your game today.  How did you feel coming off the course?  
DYLAN MEYER: Not very good.  Not a good day.  Didn't hit it very well.  Just kind of struggled to get it around.  Didn't make any putts.   
I guess that's just golf and that's the way it goes.  You're going to have them every once in a while.  Just unfortunate I had to do it today on a very soft and gettable day.   
 Q.  How do you think the delay today affected your play?  
DYLAN MEYER: Didn't really affect my play.  I mean, I only had two holes in, not even a full two holes, so it wasn't really a full reboot.   
I still wasn't hitting it great when I came off those first two holes.  I thought the rain delay was going to help me, but it didn't.  I just kind of kept the same momentum all day long, which was basically nothing.   
 Q.  Any changes you make for tomorrow?  
DYLAN MEYER: Got to find something or else I'm going to get run over.   
 Q.  Think the course will still be soft tomorrow?  
DYLAN MEYER: It'll be soft.  It will be receptive.  I think there might be some more rain tonight.  Definitely it's going to be soft, but I think the superintendant is going to get it ready for us the best he can.
