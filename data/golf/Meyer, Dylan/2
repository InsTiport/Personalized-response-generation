 Q.  You've got to be pretty happy.  
DYLAN MEYER: Yeah, you know I'm real happy about what I posted out there today.  Hit the ball really; putted well.  Just executed the game plan that Steve and I set together in our practice rounds.  That's ultimately the goal.   
I've been feeling good about my swing coming into this week, and finally putting it all together felt really good.   
 Q.  You're from Evansville, Indiana; it's cold up there sometimes.  University of Illinois.  So this really isn't cold for you, is it?  
DYLAN MEYER: No.  I saw a couple guys out here with stocking caps and stuff.  Kind of made me laugh.   
Yeah, I've been practicing in this for the last couple weeks.  Back at home it's been 5-, 60 degrees, and I kind of saw the forecast.  What's the point of going to Florida or somewhere warm.  I just kind of got used to the climate, used to the weather, and that really benefited me.   
Definitely being at home this long and getting this advantage to play in this weather has been nice.   
 Q.  You're one of the few pros that wear prescription glasses.  Most guys go contact lenses or whatever.  Was there a problem yesterday with the rain keeping them dry?  
DYLAN MEYER: No, no, there wasn't.  You have the umbrella and everything like that.  It wasn't too bad.  But I've had them for a while.  I just kind of deal with them.   
I have a towel in the bag to wipe them off if they get too wet.  Didn't really run into any problems yesterday.
