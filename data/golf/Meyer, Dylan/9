Q. Looked like you were in control into the break.  Any difference?
DYLAN MEYER: I think I de pressed a little too much.  I didn't even get my phone out.  But I guess I didn't come out focused like I thought I'd be.  But hey, things happen.  That's golf.
Q. You also ran into a buzzsaw; the opposite happened for your opponent.
DYLAN MEYER: Yeah, he played well.  All day long, he was hanging in and make something good looks.  Eventually he was going to start making some putts and that chip-in he had on 16 was awesome.  It's good seeing him playing well.  It's good competition.
