   SCOTT STRANGE:  I drove it in the fairway trap on the last right up against the lip with an overhanging tree. There was nothing I could do. Tried to hit a seven iron out and it hit the tree and the next shot has flown over, caught the cart path and you saw where it finished. 

 Q.  Those three birdies on the back nine put you right in there? 
 SCOTT STRANGE:  I have been playing well all week and after my third birdie on the 15th thought I had a nice putt on the 16th and it got away from me. I three putted that but played nice all week. 

 Q.  What were you thinking on the 18th? 
 SCOTT STRANGE:  Just put a nice swing on it and go from there. Obviously it went in the bunker but I was dead in the bunker. I could have gone out sideways but then needed a three iron in so I tried to get down there and have a wedge in but with hindsight it was not the best call. I knew I was in or around the lead. I had a look at the leaderbaord on the 15th and made the putt which put me in the lead. But I saw Brownie had gone to 17 and needed a birdie on the last. 

 Q.  Sum up the week? 
 SCOTT STRANGE:  It was good. I would have taken it at the start of the week. I played well, the best I have played this year and I am looking forward to the rest of the year now. 

 Q.  What do you think of Mark's achievement? 
 SCOTT STRANGE:  Since the Volvo last year at the Thai Country Club he has been playing great so he has kept the form going. And to do it back-to-back is phenomenal, especially going from a small event to this which is good going.
