 Q.  Eight birdies and a double-bogey, give us your thoughts on the round.  
JENS DANTORP: That double-bogey was not very pleasant but apart from that, played really well today, so I'm really pleased.   
 Q.  Two really good rounds of golf to put you nicely in contention going into the weekend.  That must be pleasing on what's been tricky conditions?  
JENS DANTORP: Yeah, the wind picked up a little bit after six or seven holes.  I'm very pleased with the round today, and being in that position for the weekend.   
 Q.  Was it nice to be able to be quite a aggressive here, the fact that the greens are so soft you could almost go seeking the pins out?  
JENS DANTORP: Well, yeah, it is, absolutely, when you get something going, you just go at it.   
 Q.  Obviously nicely placed going into the weekend, you were 109, coming back to The European Tour after The Challenge Tour last year.  A big week this week would take pressure off the rest of the year for you?  
JENS DANTORP: Yeah, a good weekend here, and yeah, like you said, takes the pressure off.  I need to do well to do that, and I'm looking forward to the week.   
 Q.  Obviously the second Rolex Series after Wentworth last week.  Do you notice a difference in the atmosphere playing in these bigger events?  
JENS DANTORP: Yeah, it is.  It's nice to play against the bigger players and also the courses are a bit more challenging, so it's nice.
