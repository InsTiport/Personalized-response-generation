JENS DANTORP: Unfortunately finished with a pretty stupid bogey, but it happens.   
 Q.  A lot of people say that's a pretty daunting tee shot off 18 coming down there with the rough down both sides.  What do you feel when you're standing over the tee on a tough hole like that?  
JENS DANTORP: You just have to commit, hit it.  Pick a way to play it and if you want to drop it short of the bunkers, do that, or if you don't want to take it on, just hit it.  If it goes into the bunker in the rough, there's nothing you can do, really.   
 Q.  Have you played aggressively the first two days?  
JENS DANTORP: Here and there.  I took 15 on a little bit and 16, as well, and 18, so yeah, I think so.   
 Q.  Nice to be in contention in a big Rolex Series Event.  How much are you looking forward to the weekend?  
JENS DANTORP: It's going to be good fun.  Just keep going.  Play my game and hopefully I can keep the putter hot over the weekend.
