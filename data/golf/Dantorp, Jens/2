Q. Thoughts on the round and the changing conditions, the wind?
JENS DANTORP: I didn't think it was that bad in the beginning.  A couple good chances and didn't make the putts.  But I kept patient and it was nice to finish.
Q. A lot of players are going in the wrong direction today.  Must be nice for you to have stayed calm and kept a good score leading into Sunday.
JENS DANTORP: Yeah, it was a totally different course today.  The wind was blowing hard and in a different direction.  Wasn't the same course, really.  Feels good to have kept the good momentum going.
Q. And an exciting prospect for you now on Sunday, leading in a Rolex Series Event on what will be a tough day.
JENS DANTORP: It will be a new experience, but really looking forward to it.  Yeah, hopefully I'll stay on top.
