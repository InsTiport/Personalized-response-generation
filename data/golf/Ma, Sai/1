Q. This is your first LPGA tournament, and there are a lot of viewers and media reporters who are maybe not too familiar with you.  Can you give us a basic overview, even things like birthday and height they are curious about.
SAI MA: I was born in '95, January 8.  I'm currently at year two at University of Auckland doing a double major in psychology and sports and exercise.
This is my second professional event since I turned pro in the beginning of this year.  It's really exciting to play here, and even though today out there I was struggling with my putting, the speed of the green.
But overall, I'm quite happy with my performance as my second professional event.  I hit some really good shots, and yes, just really cool to learn a lot of experiences with all the top players in the world.
Q. What was the first professional tournament that you competed in?
SAI MA: My first one was about three or four weeks ago in Thailand, the Thailand LPGA Masters, and I made the cut.  I was very happy, and I finished tied 42nd.
Q. How did you start golf, and who influenced your decision to become a professional golfer?
SAI MA: I started golf when I was roundabout seven or eight because my family all plays golf.  But I kind of went through high school half-golf, half-school, because I really enjoy studying, and I found psychology, it's really interesting, so I don't want to give up studying.
But since I turned pro, and I'm already 21, if I don't come out here -- because playing on Tour has been my dream since I started golf and now it's my dream come true.  I just want to play for maybe five years, give myself maybe five years of time to see how well I can get.
Q. Did you say your height?
SAI MA: I'm 162 centimeters.
