 Q.  John, you had it going early on and then you lost it a little bit at the rain and then made a really good swing after that fat shot over there on 12.  
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: Yeah.  You know, I got off to a really good start, very in control of my golf ball, and the speed on the greens, and then after the rain delay, I just -- I told Kane we needed to refocus and everything, but I definitely didn't conduct the rain delay probably as I should have.  I didn't get really back into the round for a few holes, and that's unacceptable at this stage.   
But after that, after the shot on 12, I pulled Kane aside, my caddie, and I said, we need to talk through some more shots, kind of slow things down and really get our focus back, our process back in order because if we don't, we're not playing tomorrow.   
 Q.  One of the things that was so impressive to me, obviously that up-and-down on 18 yesterday, you gave us a little idea of what the wedge play is all about, and then when you lost your swing a little bit, the wedge play really showed up around the greens.  
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: Yeah, yeah.  Chipping is something that I've done well for a long time and something I'm very comfortable with, but it's also a product of leaving the ball in the right spot.  I understand I hit some bad shots into some spots, but none of them were impossible chips, and I think that's really important around here, to make sure that you're in the right spot because if you can do that, you can always kind of hang around in the hole.  But yeah, I hit a couple good ones out there.
