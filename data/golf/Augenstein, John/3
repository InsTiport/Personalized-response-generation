 Q. Were you able to get some momentum for the afternoon?   
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: Yeah, so we were on 12 green and I elected to putt out last night because I'd rather have a 3âwood off a tee than an eightâfoot birdie putt to come out of the gate. I don't know, I just felt more comfortable putting out last night, and so it was definitely different. I mean, I think when you're in the middle of the kind of rhythm of the round, 13 seems a bit easier, but coming out of the gate with a tight tee shot and a 4â or 5âiron off a sideâhill lie can be tough. I got off to a great start and just kind of made pars coming down the stretch, so it was good.   
   
 Q. Take us through 13; what did you have in there?   
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: Yeah, I think I had 215 and kind of with just the heavy air this morning, I decided to kind of choke down on a 4âiron a little bit, and caught it a touch thin, kind of hitting to the left bank there and rolled back into the little collection area. It was really a pretty straightforward chip. Obviously you never know you're going to make it, but I felt pretty good about getting it upâandâdown and just kind of came off right and caught the right edge and went in.   
   
 Q. As good as that one felt, how important were the upâandâdown par saves at 14 and 17?   
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: Yeah, I would say so. I think those are just really big for momentum to kind of save par there. I didn't really come out hitting it that great this morning, so I kind of had to scramble a little bit. I'd like to hit it a little better this afternoon and make it a little easier on myself.   
   
 Q. What do you expect from this course this afternoon?   
JOHN AUGENSTEIN: I'd expect the greens to get a little firmer. They were definitely faster this morning. I mean, I would just expect the golf course to firm up a little bit. It's going to be warm this afternoon and no rain for the next three days it looks like. So I would imagine it gets a little tougher each day. Pleased with how I played but left some out there but also made a couple, so just excited to get going again this afternoon or this morning.
