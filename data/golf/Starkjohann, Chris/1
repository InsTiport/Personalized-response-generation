 Q. Talk about the conditions on the course. 
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: The conditions are tough. It's hard to find a lot of casual water relief. I found some on 1 and 15. But for the most part -- maybe on 5 on the front -- the rest of them you just had to pick it and slash it. 

 Q. Talk about your day today, your game today. 
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: My day was, I got off to a rough start. I hit a couple bad shots and made double. I was just above the bunker on 11. I had to drop it just below the bunker. And so I went double bogey, bogey. I struggled a little on the back. But I played pretty good on the front. I just made a few dumb mistakes. 
 I bogeyed 4 from 91 yards and I bogeyed 9 from about 150, so I didn't play real good on the start but I got it together on the back nine.
