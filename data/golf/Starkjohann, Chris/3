  Q. So 69 today, comments on your round?  
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: I played real solid today. I putted better with my other putter. I hit the ball solid. Just made a bad decision on, didn't commit to my 3-wood on number 4.   
 I had 230 to the center and just came off a little bit and I made a bad chip and 3-putted. So that was my only really hiccup today.   
  
  Q. Second place, second low club pro, thoughts on that?  
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: Well, I'm happy with the way I played today. I just, it was a good finish, and I'm happy for Lindy, he played well this week, so he deserves it.   
  
  Q. What's the support been like coming from back home?  
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: It's been good. I've got my whole family here. I grew up around here. So I got my mom and dad and brother and sister and all that, so it was fun to be able to play well while they were here.   
  
  Q. Thoughts on the experience as a whole this weekend?  
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: It's always a very good experience when you can make the cut at a Major. That's always our goal as a club pro. And you want to do as well as you can on the weekend. So it's a pleasure to be here.
