 Q. Talk about the birdie you had on hole 3. 
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: On 3? Well, I hit driver all the way down there to the 116 marker and coming across I had probably about 128 with the wind and everything. I hit a wedge in there pretty well and it came up a little short, but I made, that was the longest putt I made all day and it was about a 25-footer. I hit it and it went in.

 Q. Do you want to compare both rounds you played in so far?
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: Well, I really played a lot more solid. I putted better. Today I didn't make a putt, other than maybe a couple in there about seven feet or under. Really just tap-ins. But I didn't putt very well from 10 feet on in today, so that was the difference. I threw six shots away from 8 all the way to 18.

 Q. How does it feel to make the cut?
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: Well, it always feels good. I think this is my third or fourth PGA, I think it is my third, and I made the cut in two. So I feel pretty good. 
 I missed the cut in Kiawah and -- no, was Kiawah the Senior PGA Championship? I can't remember. I missed the cut at Oak Hill. So I made two cuts in this and it feels good.
