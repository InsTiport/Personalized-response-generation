 Q. Talk about the round, how did it go? Talk about the experience of being at the PGA. 
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: The experience was great. I kind of reassured myself I could play with these guys out here. 
 I didn't putt well today. I had four 3-putts on the front so, that kind of got me off to a bad start. But all in all, it was a good experience. It's always fun to come out and play.

 Q. What did you learn here, whether it's playing with these guys or in the round in general that you'll take back to your membership at home? 
 CHRIS STARKJOHANN: Well, it's patience. The weather dictates kind of what you need to do out there. The wind blew harder I think this morning, so the greens will be tough this afternoon. I played myself out of contention this morning on the front nine, of making the cut. 
 You know, it's a fun experience and hopefully I have some good memories to take back.
