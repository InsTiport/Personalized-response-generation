 Q. Scott Sterling, you shoot one 64, that's very nice. You shoot another one, that's good stuff. Nice playing today, bogey-free.
 SCOTT STERLING: Yeah. Solid again today. Made some putts kind of like the first day and yesterday I played, you know, played okay, too, just didn't putt that well and didn't get it up and down a couple times and that was the big difference. I didn't feel like I played that much different, actually, from yesterday to today.

 Q. You got that LSU Tiger headcover on your driver and yet it was the short irons that really, obviously, were showing today.
 SCOTT STERLING: Feel like I've been hitting it well. Fortunately, I rolled some putts in today.

 Q. You've made about a half dozen cuts this year. Are you feeling comfortable in your rookie year, are you really finally feeling like you belong here now?
 SCOTT STERLING: Even at the beginning of the year I didn't feel uncomfortable, I just been struggling with putting all year and I think the Nationwide Tour definitely helped playing out there the last five, six years and, you know, I didn't really see much of a an adjustment, but it just so happened I'm making a few putts this week.

 Q. We won't start running the FedEx numbers seriously until Sunday but you're in the hunt to make a playoff run. Was that a goal at the start of the season, "I want to make a playoffs when it's over"?
 SCOTT STERLING: At the start of the season, sure, I thought I would have been a lot better by now. Like I say, I haven't felt like I've scored that well this year going into this week, you know, I'm just hoping to have a good week no matter if I make the playoffs or not, just try to get some money up there to count on the money list.

 Q. Keeping going well. Again, two 64s.
