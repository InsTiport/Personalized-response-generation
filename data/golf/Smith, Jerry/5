Q.  Great round today, any difference between yesterday's round and today's round, whether conditions about the same?
JERRY SMITH:  I felt like the conditions were relatively the same.  I felt like I hit it about the same, so I was pleased with that.  I really hit it well yesterday and thought I could maybe have gotten a little bit more out of it but I was very pleased and pleased with today's round.
Q.  Talk about your off season, getting ready for this season, did you do anything specific that might be the reason why you got such a good jump start this week?
JERRY SMITH:  Well, I didn't do a great deal.  But I live in Scottsdale and I get out at least every week, you know, two or three times a week and play, play with friends, practice a little bit.

I did play a couple of events in the off season and in the middle of December, then last week in Scottsdale there's a little Desert Marlin Tournament that a lot of the guys play as just kind of somewhat of a tune up but it's more for fun.

I've played well here in the past and I like it, the wind is very, very difficult, but I've played in Asia, played in a lot of this stuff.  So I feel pretty comfortable here.
