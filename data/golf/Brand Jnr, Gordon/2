 Q. Were there any surprises out there today? 
 GORDON BRAND: Only how badly I played. But other than that, no, it was pretty much as it was in practice. It was tricky. I didn't play well, if you didn't play well, you were going to struggle all day long. 

 Q. Was there a best club in your bag today?
 GORDON BRAND: No, nothing was working that well. I suppose I putted, I holed out, I could have 3-putted a lot more. So especially with the greens being so quick.

 Q. I saw you birdie the 8th hole. Did you feel like you were starting to get it together at the end?
 GORDON BRAND: No, not at all. That was, I played the hole, I played the hole okay and hit the putt, if it had missed it would have gone six feet past. And then played the putt at the last poorly, but salvaged a par. So I kept it, it could have been 85 or 86, I suppose, so I kept it reasonably respectable.
