  Q. Three under at Muirfield is a great start?   
 GORDON BRAND:  I played well but still missed a few short putts. It was a good day and the crowd enjoyed it. The weather held off, which made it even better and Gary (Player) played really well.   
    
  Q. Does it rub off you when you play in the company of someone like that?   
 GORDON BRAND:  Not on the golf but the company is great. He's great company - he'll talk forever if you get him going.   
  
  Q. You finished last season with two wins and started this European Seniors Tour season with a win. What's been behind the strong form?   
 GORDON BRAND:  I have gained in confidence slowly and it creeps up on you. You hope to peak in the bigger events. I failed in the US Senior PGA but let's just hope this week is different.
