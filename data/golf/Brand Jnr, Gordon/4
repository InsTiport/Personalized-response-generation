Q.   General comments?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  I am quite happy with that really as I struggled in the heat, terrible headache.  But I played bad today.  I was a bit more interested, so I enjoyed it, really. 
 

Q.   Take some medication?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  Took some Advil, somewhere, 15th or something. 
 

Q.   Does the heat give you a headache?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  I think so, yeah.  I am not great in the heat when we play in it.  There is not a great deal of sunshine in Scotland. 
 

Q.   Not even in Britain?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  Not even in Britain either.  There is not a great deal. 
 

Q.   You asked to play in shorts like Sam did?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  I would like to.  I don't know if it makes you that much more comfortable.  I think it is a discomfort.  Are you sweating all the time; you are-- never really-- I find it very difficult to concentrate. 
 

Q.   Did you ask John about shorts?
 
GORDON BRAND, JR.:  No, I didn't.
