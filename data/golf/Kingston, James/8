 Q. 5-under opening round; pleased? 
 JAMES KINGSTON: Yeah, absolutely. The fact that it's a new tournament, new golf course, nobody knew what to expect from this week. Everybody has heard the rumours about the greens being really undulating, and they are, but obviously shooting 5-under par, pleased with that.

 Q. How has everything gone so far with the new event? 
 JAMES KINGSTON: Obviously great. It's a great setup that they have got here. The weather was absolutely unbelievable, just perfect golfing weather. So from that point of view, everything so far has been just a real treat. 

 Q. How did you find the course condition?
 JAMES KINGSTON: The course is in great condition. I think from tee-to-green, it's a really great golf course. 
 Obviously the greens are really undulating, but I think as players get used to it, they will find that it's probably not as hard as we all pictured it to be, unless the wind picks up. If the wind gets up, it's going to be a little trickier to get the ball in the right areas, and then players are going to probably struggle around the greens a little more.
