 Q. How do you think about your chances? 
 JAMES KINGSTON: Yeah, be I don't know. I feel like it's probably one light. I needed one more, that last putt on the green, nice to be 11 are under on the clubhouse and post a score and see what happens.
 All in all, a good day, a great weekend. To shoot 10-under over the weekend, pretty decent.

 Q. To make the cut on the mark with two 72s, and then two 67s; what changed? 
 JAMES KINGSTON: Not much. I think yesterday was a disappointing day really because I shot 5-under par but really should have been 8- or 9-under. I made two really stupid bogeys from absolutely nowhere and gave myself so many chances and never converted enough of them. Same today, really got off to a flying start, and unbelievable, 6, 7, 8, 9 never converted any of those. And then you make birdie on 17 and had a chance on 18, didn't hit it great but then had all the chances. Still, all in all pretty pleased with the way I played.

 Q. What will you do now?
 JAMES KINGSTON: Right now? Going to wait and see and obviously I'm going back home after this week. I've got a few weeks off. It's been six weeks on the trot for us, so a lot of golf and much needed rest.
