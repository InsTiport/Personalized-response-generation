 Q.  Can you just tell me how you felt standing on the first tee this morning?  
CONOR PURCELL: Yeah, we were both quite calm. I was a little bit feeling anxious I'd say on the range and anticipating the crowds, and then we got there and we were just feeding off each other, and everyone was kind of calm, so we were fine. Alex hit his tee shot very well and kind of took charge from there.   
 Q.  First points on the board; do you think that will encourage your teammates out there?  
CONOR PURCELL: Yeah, that's big. I think any time you see the first point go up and when it's our first group, that's a big thing. So glad we led the boys anyway, and hopefully we come out on top.
