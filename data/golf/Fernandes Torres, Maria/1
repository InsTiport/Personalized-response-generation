Q. A great round, how do you feel after your third round?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   I feel good.  I just finished right now.  It felt really long, the round.  I was pleased with everything today.  I need to get a little bit of practice on some putts, but I'm feeling really good.
Q. And then you did also really well at Wal-Mart.  Have you changed anything or are you sticking to the same plan?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   I'm sticking to the same plan.  I'm trying to be calm out there and stay positive and just keep going.  I'm trying to get as much birdies as I can.
Q. How about course conditions, are they conducive to getting birdies?  Is it easy to get birdies?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   Well, first you have to hit it on the fairway to get really good opportunities, and then you have to take advantage of those opportunities.
Q. What exactly with your putting do you think you're going to work on?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   More a little bit on the rhythm on the shorter putts and I'm sticking more to the line that I pick.  I think that's one.
Q. You had a pretty long day.  What will you tell yourself mentally to relax and get ready for tomorrow?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   First I'm going to eat something, and then going to chill a little bit and just take the afternoon and try to rest as much as possible.
Q. The chemistry between you and caddie, how is that?
MARIA FERNANDES TORRES:   It's awesome to have someone to support you out there.  It's like your rock inside the golf course and you can lean on.  It has been a really good two years and a half together, so I'm thankful.
