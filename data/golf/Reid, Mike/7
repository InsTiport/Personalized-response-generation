Q.  How was the course today?
MIKE REID:  Everything is dictated by the wind.  The course has been in excellent shape all week, but every day it changes complexion a little and today was probably the kindest conditions we have seen all week.  And I kept telling myself it's going to yield a lot of birdies today, but I just couldn't seem to find very many.  But I think they were pretty kind conditions, the wind wasn't blowing too hard and it was just, it is what it is.
Q.  Any key shots in your round today?
MIKE REID:  It wasn't    well I guess 17.  I just bogeyed 15 and I made a good save at 16 and so I was, I knew that I wasn't, the last, I almost bogeyed two holes in a row and then I just hit my best shot of the day on 16.  I hit a 6 iron about eight feet and made that for birdie.  And that I guess was my shot of the day.  The rest of it was pretty you know inspiring the rest of the way.
Q.  How does it feel to be the returning champ?
MIKE REID:  It's fun, there's a few, I would call them very pleasant distractions early on in the week, the Champion's Dinner was one of the highlights of my golf life, Tuesday night.  And then as it slowly clicks on towards Thursday, by the time you tee it up you realize you're just another one of the 155 guys and after the first ball's in the air, you're just happy to have a tee time and a locker and you're just like everybody else.  We start at zero and away you go.
Q.  So not really any pressure?
MIKE REID:  I didn't think about it much after that.  But I think that tomorrow, you wouldn't say any more pressure, but you're always trying to do well.  I don't know that that changed any, but there's just a few more things to do, but they're all very pleasant.
Q.  Just trying to have fun?
MIKE REID:  Yeah.  That's right.
