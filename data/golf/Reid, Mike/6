Q.  Not out of the hunt yet, with the leader at 7 under, what are you going to have to get done to jump start you up the leaderboard tomorrow and on Sunday?
MIKE REID:  Somehow just find a way to score lower.  The conditions were quite a bit tougher today and so the even par I shot yesterday, I felt like I left a few out there, you know, and I hit the ball a little bit better today under the tougher circumstances, to earn even par today, which was a, I think, two, maybe three shots a better score than yesterday.

But I think that I just, you know, this is a very tedious golf course and I haven't figured out an answer to that question.
Q.  With the leaders where they are, do you feel like they will be perhaps becoming back, if the conditions worsen, or do you think that they will be able to post even lower numbers and stretch it out.  What do you think the winning score is going to be at in this mess?
MIKE REID:  I said earlier in the week, so much hinges on what the wind is doing out there.  And that was the difference, say, between yesterday and today.  And I don't know, I'm no weatherman, all I though is that that's going to play a role in the scoring this weekend and you'll have to sort of adjust accordingly.  So I really can't answer that until you get out here tomorrow and see what we have.
