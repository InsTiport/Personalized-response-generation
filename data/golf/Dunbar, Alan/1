  ALAN DUNBAR:   I was a bit hard on myself because I didn't play great yesterday either, but level par was a good score in those conditions.   Happier walking off the course today, chipping in for an eagle.   I didn't play great, but I'm happy. 

Q.   And tomorrow, what's the aspirations now?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Just go out tomorrow.   I'm going to go and do some work on the range now and hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to give myself a few more chances early doors to have a good chance of shooting a low score. 

Q.   In the absence of some of our major stars, nice to see an Irish golfer heading up toward the top of the leaderboard?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Yeah, I'm sure the guys are disappointed but there will be more tournaments for them.   I was happy to make the cut and shoot 69 today.
