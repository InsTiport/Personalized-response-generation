Q.   Did you have a score in mind out there?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Not really, no.   I just thought I would go out and try and hit the ball in better places and managed that at times, but even though it's hard to do.   But it just takes pars out there. 
7 I hit a good drive, about a yard off the fairway and I had no shot and I could only get it on the left side of 7 and 3‑putted, bogeyed that. 
I had a terrible bogey at 9 from the middle of the fairway and lost a bit of momentum then. 
A couple of stupid bogeys after that, but played all right.

Q.   Overall, what will be the memories of this week?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Just I'll remember the whole week.   What a great week.   I got off to a bad start yesterday, but I enjoyed it and I hope to get back. 

Q.   Did Augusta surprise you?   Was there something about Augusta that you're going to take away and say, well, I didn't expect that?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Just the whole thing.   Even today between groups they were out working on the course and blowing away the leaves and everything.   It's just different than any place else.

Q.   What shots stand out for you the most the last two days?
ALAN DUNBAR:   I hit a lot of good shots, but didn't hole many putts. 

Q.   The chip‑in at 1 was nice?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Yeah, I got a good start today.   I had a couple of good up‑and‑downs, I missed it in the right places.

Q.   You can tell the difference there, can't you?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Yeah.

Q.   When is your first tournament?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Wednesday in Madrid I think is the first tournament.   I'll be pretty busy after that.   I just don't know where yet. 

Q.   When you say Wednesday, where are you playing?
ALAN DUNBAR:   Madrid. 

Q.   Which course?
ALAN DUNBAR:   I don't know. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ALAN DUNBAR:   I'm here, I'm going to stay the weekend here and play Monday and go see my coach, catch up.   Do a bit of practice. 

Q.   Are you going to come out and watch?
ALAN DUNBAR:   I'm not sure.   I like watching on TV.   So you see more on TV than right here.   So I'll probably ‑‑ I don't know.   I'll see.   I have a few friends over.   I'll see what they want to do and I'll just follow them.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ALAN DUNBAR:   It was in the pro shop the first day I got here.   I'll probably take back a few presents, I suppose. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ALAN DUNBAR:   The practice round, I enjoyed it more in the practice round than the Tournament, but. 

Q.   Did you have any nerves walking down there?   All the history down there?
ALAN DUNBAR:   The first tee is the worst, I think.
