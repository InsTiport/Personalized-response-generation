 Q.   Will you retire now?   
JIYEON CHOI:   (Through translation.)   Tournament just finish, so we didn't talk about this.   
We think about it and then maybe we decide.   
   
 Q.   I noticed you got emotional.   What was it like watching her win?   
JIYEON CHOI:   (Through translation.)   I really waited for this time, so I'm really happy.   
Win is really important, but I try to like enjoy her golf today.   She won, so really happy.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like she was pretty close to winning?   
THE INTERPRETER:   Like today?   
   
 Q.   No, just in general.   The last couple years did it feel like she was really close?   
JIYEON CHOI:   She's really good player.   She has a lot of status last few years.   
Feel like it's coming, but she struggle with some tournament this year.  
After U.S. Open, at the U.S. Open, yeah, her shot is coming back, so, yeah, I think about.
