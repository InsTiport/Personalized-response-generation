   WANG TER-CHANG:  Had a good start with a birdie on the second hole and I was happy. But conditions were tough out there. Missed the fairway on eight for bogey and then missed fairway on nine for double bogey. Those holes knocked me off my stride.   
 Played a lot better on the back nine with four birdies, holed a 30 yard putt on the 13 for birdie which was great and had another chip in on the 17th. On the first day I also chipped in.   
 Tomorrow, I'll just aim for an under par round. I'm an old man now, under par here will be good for me
