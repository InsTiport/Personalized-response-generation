 Q.  Nice start, you must be happy with a 68? 
 WANG TER CHANG:  Yes, I hit it really good with my irons and I needed to as I didn't drive it too well. Putted nicely and holed the putts that I needed to. The greens here are very nice and the course is general is in great condition. I like it a lot. I finished tied 10th in the 2005 Thailand Open on this venue, so I like playing here. 

 Q.  How's your season been leading up to this week's Johnnie Walker Classic? 
 WANG TER CHANG:  It's not been good. I missed the cut in the Malaysian Open and Indonesian Open and didn't play very well in those weeks. 

 Q.  So where has this round come from? 
 WANG TER CHANG:  I don't know. Last week, I didn't practice much as it was the Chinese New Year. I just spent my time at home with the family. Maybe that is the reason. 

 Q.  Highlights of the round? 
 WANG TER CHANG:  I chipped in for birdie on the par three 17th from just off the green. That was pretty nice. Holed a long birdie from 18 feet on my first hole and the others were all pretty close from inside four feet. Hit some good wedges in the par 5s, 9 and 11.
