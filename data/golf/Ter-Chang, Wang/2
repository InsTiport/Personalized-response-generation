   WANG TER-CHANG:  It was a good day, my three bogeys were a result of poor drives. Hooked them into trouble. But still it was good as I shot five birdies. I'm hitting some of my irons nicely and at six-under for the tournament I'm in a good position. However, there are so many young guys ahead of me.   
 I'll try to move up over the weekend, this is a really difficult course. However, I'm comfortable on the greens and I like it very much. They are very receptive and have a good roll on them.   
 I don't want to start thinking too far ahead, like winning, just take it one day at a time. There are lots of good players in contention.   
  
  Q. How do you keep fit at 45 years of age?   
 WANG TER-CHANG I like going to the hot springs in Taipei. I do that about two or three times a week whenever I'm home for about 90 minutes each time. It helps remove the body toxins and you always feel refreshed after a session there. The warmth is good for the body. It's hot out here on course but if feel okay. But being my age, sometimes, I play good, sometimes not too good.   
 I'm looking to keep myself fit as I may want to take a shot at the US Seniors Tour when I'm eligible.
