WANG TER-CHANG:  I'm really happy with my score. I played 10 holes yesterday and was one under par and that was good. This morning, it was totally different and I hit all my greens in regulation to shoot three birdies.

In my 20 years as a pro, I've not encountered such windy conditions like what we had yesterday. In Taipei, we have strong winds all the time but nothing like this. I was really pleased to keep my score to one under yesterday as it was very hard.

In yesterday's round, I would birdie one hole, and then bogey the next, it was quite frustrating. But with the wind blowing hard, it was always going to happen. I just kept my composure.

The waiting was tough, it was really tiring. I just sat around with my friends yesterday and just chatted away to pass the time. And now, I'm finished so early this morning and have nothing much to do.

I'll probably go and practice a little bit and then return to the hotel. Don't think I'll be doing any sightseeing here as I've been to the Great Wall before.

I've not had any top-10s before in the Johnnie Walker Classic, although I've played in many. But it was in this event that I played with Tiger Woods in 1999 when the event was held in Taipei. That was quite an experience and hopefully, I can maintain my form.

I'm swinging it nicely so far, so I hope to keep to my rhythm.
