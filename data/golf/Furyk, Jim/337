 Q. I'm guessing there's some fatigue with you coming all the way from Royal Birkdale to here and then playing 27 today?
 JIM FURYK: Yeah, it's a little tough to get adjusted to the time change. But you know, it's been a few days. I'm feeling all right. 
 I think the hardest part really was sitting around all day yesterday. When you sit, you get tired. 
 When we came out today, though -- both days, the golf course, it's like walking in sand out there. 27 today kind of felt like 36. You just have to remind yourself to stay focused towards the end of these days. It's real easy to lose your concentration and throw away a couple shots, so you just want to grind it out down the stretch and make sure you stay patient, stay in the game.

 Q. I followed you for nine holes yesterday, and you may be the one non-Canadian that these fans are rooting for. Your response to how the fans have been treating you? 
 JIM FURYK: Well, it's been fantastic. I had a warm welcome back last year, and then to be able to finish strong on the weekend and win again, two years in a row, it's been nice. Really, I appreciate it. There's a few places I've played well throughout our TOUR stops, and it's always nice to come back and get that warm welcome. 
 The Canadians love their sports, they love their golf, and I'm proud about winning the championship the last couple years.
