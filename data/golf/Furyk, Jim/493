Q.  Jim, David, it's a disappointing morning.  The golf course played particularly difficult; did that have an impact on you?
JIM FURYK:  I think we all should expect that.  We're playing a Major championship type course and a Major championship type setup.  So the golf course is slow, relatively soft for the practice rounds.  But I think that, my guess is it was going to get a little firmer and faster, I think the wind probably helped that out.
Q.  David, is there any way to explain not having a birdie on your card today?

DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, when you don't play great golf on a U.S. Open setup; that's the way it's going to be.  The few chances I did have, I didn't capitalize on them.

So I think the way we played, we kept it in play, -- I think it would have been a good morning for alternate shot, but not a good one for bestball.  We just never did make any birdies at all, and so that's the way it goes.
Q.  Talk about day one, first four matches.
JIM FURYK:  We've got to keep our head up right now.  We obviously got outplayed this morning, but it's the first of five sets of matches.  So we need to keep our head up and grind it out and come out playing better.
Q.  The golf course today, was that it or was it just the match-play?
JIM FURYK:  Well, the golf course played tough.  I don't think David and I were real happy.  We only made two birdies between us, so we're not real happy with that performance.  But the golf course played tough.  We didn't play as well as we wanted to.
