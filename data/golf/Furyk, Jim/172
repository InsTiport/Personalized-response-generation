Q.   Seemed like a little bit of a scrambling round today.   How did you feel about how you were hitting it? 
JIM FURYK:   Actually I would have said the opposite.   It's probably my best ball‑striking round of the week but did a poor job of getting the ball in the hole.   My short game let me down a little bit, and I didn't putt nearly as well today.   Every day I think I hit the ball a little bit better, which was a goal, but I haven't done as good a job with the putter and around the greens, and that's why the scores have stayed pretty much the same, and today was my worst putting round, that's why I shot only 1‑under.

Q.   Graeme has opened up a little bit of a lead with Keegan.   What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?
JIM FURYK:   We'll see where he finishes up tomorrow.   He's good with the lead, he's good managing it.   He's a guy that doesn't make a lot of mistakes, so someone is going to have to go out there and catch him, he's not going to come back to the field I don't think.

Q.   Do you think there's a low round out here on the golf course?
JIM FURYK:   I do.   I do.   It would depend on conditions.   If it's raining tomorrow like it was this morning, then I'll go with no.   Then there's a chance for a 75 or something like that.   But you know, if the conditions are like they were on the back nine today, if we don't have a lot of rain, the greens are so soft, someone could get on a roll, you just have to knock some putts in.
