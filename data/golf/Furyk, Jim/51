 Q.  I'm ready when you are, starting on 1.  
JIM FURYK: Driver, 9-iron, about 15 feet, and I missed the putt.   
No. 2, driver, 60-degree wedge, probably about 15 feet, made the putt.   
3 was a driver and a pitching wedge that I holed.   
4, I hit driver, ball was in a divot and hit a 4-iron to about four feet, one of the best shots of the day.   
No. 5, I hit a hybrid probably to about 25 feet, two-putt.   
No. 6, I hit a driver and a 3-wood, almost pin high, or just a little short left of the pin.  Was probably about three yards off the green.  I putted it up to about four feet and made that for birdie.   
No. 7, driver, 9-iron to about a foot.   
No. 8, 4-iron, about 12 to 15 feet, made that for birdie.   
No. 9 was a hybrid, pitching wedge to about a foot.   
10 was driver, 8-iron, about 12 feet.  Again, fix up the putt distances.   
11 was 9-iron, probably about 15 feet, made that.   
12 was 3-wood, 9-iron, about six feet.   
13, driver, drove it in a divot, so I had to lay up, otherwise I would have had a go.  I hit a 7-iron and a sand wedge to about 25 feet.   
14 was driver, 9-iron to about 10 feet.   
15, I hit a driver just a few yards short of the green, hit a 7-iron bump-and-run probably about eight feet past and lipped it out.   
16 was an 8-iron to about 20 feet.   
17 was hybrid, 8-iron, probably about 30 feet past.   
And 18 was driver, 9-iron to about 20 feet.
