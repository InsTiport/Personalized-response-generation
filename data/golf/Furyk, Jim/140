 Q.   Jim, 2‑down through 10.   What changed?   The back nine seemed to go your way?  
JIM FURYK:   Well, I had a lot of opportunities on the front, to be honest with you.   I just didn't knock in some putts.   We played pretty even, I thought, on the front.   Charl was more solid with the putter.   I let some short ones for birdie slide by.   
On the back nine I mad some birdies, got the ball going in the hole.   I made a great save at 14 to put some pressure on him.   
He had a couple of bad shots, uncharacteristic.   I really think Charl is a great ball striker.   Most of the time I've play with him he's hit it very, very well.   He hit a couple of wayward shots today that helped me out on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   Has this golf course changed at all throughout the week?   Getting windier and firmer in some places?   
JIM FURYK:   It's getting firmer definitely.   I think it was more consistent today.   Then the breeze was tough at times.   It was‑‑ I didn't feel steady.   Kind of get a gust, lay down, gust and lay down.   
I was listening to the radio on the way in, and they said a lot of guys were struggling with getting the ball hole high.   And 18, I guess, was one of those places.   You can hit off some pretty high peaks at spots here.   You're putting the ball up in the wind.   At times I thought it was difficult to judge.
