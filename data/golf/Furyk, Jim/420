Q.  Thoughts on playing with Tiger tomorrow.
JIM FURYK:  Well, obviously, Colin has actually been out in a lot of first matches in the last few Ryder Cups, so interesting pair ups, and both obviously Padraig and Colin are good players and I respect both of them.  We'll have to go out there and play well.
Q.  Obviously pairing with Tiger, a guy you know pretty well, you've played with him?
JIM FURYK:  Yeah, I enjoy playing with Tiger.  It was no secret we were going to get paired together and hopefully we can continue some of the momentum from last year.
