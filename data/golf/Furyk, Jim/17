JIM FURYK: It was nice.  Not a lot of wind and we got off to a good start on the front nine.  I birdied 11 and then it started.  The wind picked up a little bit when I got to about 13, started raining when we got to 16.  So at that point it was just survive and get in the house.   
 Q.  A lot of emphasis on the Ryder Cup the last couple of years, trying to get that team ready for France.  What's your schedule going to look like moving forward for the year ahead?  
JIM FURYK: I'm playing about 18 to 20 events.  Right now that's about a full schedule for me.  But I have a freshman and a junior in high school at home and I want to be back as much as possible.  But I'm still excited about playing.  Healthy right now.  I didn't start the last three seasons healthy.  So right now I feel good, I feel younger, just want to see where it will take me this year.  I want to play a lot and excited about playing.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on Tony Romo's game.  What did you see out there?  
JIM FURYK: I wish you were here.  So when the cameras went on, Tony's game went on.  He saved his best golf for that back nine in tough conditions and I think he made four birdies on the back nine today.  So great playing and he's fun to play with, good guy.  And the beauty of golf is we get to meet people from all walks of life.  Being a big sports fan myself and a big football fan, it's fun.
