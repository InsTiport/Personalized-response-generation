 Q.  How do you explain the great match together in this situation? 
 JIM FURYK:  We couldn't explain it yesterday, I know that.  It was nice to come out, I think sometimes that putts a little fire under your rear end and it's nice to come out and, you know, after feeling so bad yesterday with the finish, to come out here and get a win for the team, put another point up is great.
