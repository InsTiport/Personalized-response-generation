Q.   Nice playing today, 65.   Just get some comments on the round. 
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, it was nice to get off to a nice quick start this morning, birdieing 2, birdieing 4.   Got a couple under.   It was nice to see some putts go in, so it took a little stress off‑‑ I hit the ball pretty well in round 1 and really didn't get a lot out of it.   And yesterday I thought I hit some good putts and didn't see a lot go in.   But it was nice to see some putts go in today.   Took some stress off the rest of my game.   And then have kind of a good start and good finish, birdied four of the last six.

Q.   Take us through those four if you can. 
JIM FURYK:   I birdied 13, beautiful drive and a 9‑iron to about eight feet left of the hole.
15 was the one where I kind of stole a shot or two.   I drove it in the right rough and tried to hit kind of a running shot and run it up on the green and didn't hit it real solid, left it short right, left myself in a really tough position to get the ball up‑and‑down and holed a pitch shot from about 30 yards, so that was like stealing a shot.
I hit an 8‑iron to about a foot on 16.
And a driver and a 4‑iron in the middle of the green on 18 and two‑putted from 25 feet.
