Q.  Great round today.  Except for the last hole, your putt lipping out, how do you feel you about your round?
JIM FURYK:  I had trouble getting going early.  I didn't make a birdie until the sixth hole today.  I kind of got in a good rhythm out there and played well the last 12 holes.

As you mentioned, I missed a 5 footer for birdie on 18.  I hit it exactly where I wanted to.  It just didn't go in.  If I had hit a bad putt, I would probably be a bit more disappointed, but I hit it right where I wanted to and it broke a little more and spun out on me.
Q.  Did the course dry out as the day went on?  Did you notice that and is that an advantage?
JIM FURYK:  I don't know what it was like.  It wasn't too much different from the time I teed off to the time I finished.  I don't know what the guys played on this morning at 7:30.

I'm sure they putted on smoother greens and they were probably a little more worried about spinning some of those wedges back off the greens than we were.

The golf course is playing totally different right now.  The golf course is playing real firm, real fast.  You're hitting 5 irons into 16 and I was reaching it with like a 5 wood at times, where today they were not reachable because it was wet and not rolling.  It's playing a lot different.  Last year it was real wet also.  I got off to a good start, and that's similar, but I have to keep it going.  Scores are going to be low for the rest of the week and you have to shoot 5  to 10 under.
