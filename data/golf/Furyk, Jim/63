 Q.  69 for Jim Furyk, you're in at 14-under.  Probably a little shy now in this one.  How did you feel you played today?  JIM FURYK: I played pretty well today.  I had my opportunities, especially on the back nine.  I had four good opportunities for birdie, and I just couldn't really see a putt go in from 15 or 18, and really that is the difference.  I needed to birdie two or three of those holes, and I wasn't able to make a putt.   Q.  It was a fast start, wasn't it?  Way to make a start with two quick birdies.  JIM FURYK: Yeah, hit an 8-iron left of the hole, this one was breaking maybe two cups left to right.  It was nice to get off to a good start, and I really hadn't done that yet this week, especially on the front nine.  To get out there and birdie 1 and 2 and get some momentum and birdie 5, and I had it at 3-under for a while.  Little slip up at 6, but overall played pretty well today.   Q.  The other shot I wanted to go through with you as well was the approach into 13.  You hit about 253.  JIM FURYK: Yeah, that is my hybrid.  I was playing a little downwind, playing short.  Just trying to land one on the front of the green and see if I could chase it back there.  I kind of fell and you know big mistake.  I hit a great drive, great second shot.  I left the eagle putt short. So I fell in love with the line, and left it a couple feet short.   Q.  Talk me through how special the atmosphere of the crowds were here today?  JIM FURYK: Well, the Canadians are a proud bunch.  They love their sports.  I think they've always been a very good crowd.  Obviously, they're pulling for Mr. Hearn out there.  It's a matter of time.  There are so many good Canadian players.  I feel bad Mike Weir never won this golf tournament.  But Graham DeLaet, David, there are a bunch of fine young players, so I'm sure it's going to happen.
