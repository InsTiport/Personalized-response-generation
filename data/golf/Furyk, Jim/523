MODERATOR:  Thank you, Jim, for joining us for a few minutes.  Great finish today with that birdie on 18.

JIM FURYK: Yeah, finishing up was nice.  I was trying to roll that long putt up there close and got an extra bonus.  It leaves a good taste in my mouth.  Overall it was a pretty solid game today.  I picked a few bad clubs on the way in, but other than that, I'm real happy with the day.  Starting today I was trying to shoot a low number and put myself in position, and I ended up in the lead.  One thing you know the scores are going to be low on this golf course, so I need to go out and fire it up tomorrow.

MODERATOR:  Questions?


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: I don't think it really matters that much.  I wanted to go out and get a low number, and whether I'm playing with Tiger or someone else, it doesn't make that much of a difference other than it felt like 20,000 people were watching us.  It doesn't matter who you're with.  You want to play well and try to get yourself to where you have an opportunity.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: They were relatively polite.  Everyone in our group played pretty well today.  I think they wanted to watch golf and Tiger more than anyone else.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: Well, yeah, I do like the golf course.  To get the ball in play, you're going to have a lot of short irons in play.  When I'm playing well, my strength is driving the ball accurately, and because I'm not very long off the tee, I have always had to be pretty good.  I have to be pretty good with the short iron.  I'm good with the short irons and wedges.  So far this week I've done that.  I hit a lot of fairways and hit some good wedge shots.  I'm comfortable here, and I do like the golf course for that reason.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: No, not at all.  Whether we tee off at 10:00 or 2:00, it doesn't matter either way.  It's nice to play it in twosomes because you play at a quicker pace and get more of a rhythm.  Whereas if you have a four-hour pace or five-hour pace, I think it's more fun for the fans to move along at a better clip.  Nothing really changes.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: Well, there is always an advantage of being in the last group because you have the last say in what happens.  As far as watching the board, I don't think it really matters.  You hit that Back  9 stretch, guys are making birdies, so you don't really need to look up there.  You know it's happening, and I like to look at the board just to get an idea, reference where I am at.  I didn't do it much today.  Most of the reason was I knew I had to make a bunch of birdies and go out there and play hard.  I'll peek up there.  It doesn't change your style of play because you have to be aggressive, but I like to know.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: I wasn't real pleased with the way I actually  -- I drove the ball well at the British, but I didn't score well.  I managed to do okay in the bad weather Thursday and played poorly Friday.  Our tour is just opposite to the British Open style of play.  I've changed my game in the last few years where I'm comfortable here in the United States.  Now when I go to the British, I'm a lot less comfortable.  It's my fault.  I haven't made the adjustment, and I played poorly there the last few years.  It used to be I would be hitting the ball so low when I was there, I would come home and it would take me two weeks to get my game back.  Now, I'm always feeling awkward at the British.  It's in the past, and I would have liked to play better there.  You're going to have some weeks where you don't play well. 


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: Well, I pretty much always play this event.  I've only missed it once in ten years.  I do like the event.  I liked it when it was the week right before the PGA All-Star.  It's a relatively traditional golf course.  I like the International, and it's a wonderful tournament.  We get treated there probably better than anywhere on tour.  I'm not sure that style of golf is the best way for me to prepare for a major tournament.  I could kind of play my way into shape for the PGA.  I'll come here, go home for a week and prep at home.

MODERATOR:  Can you go over your birdies. 

(Score card done.)


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JIM FURYK: The shot link will tell us down to the inch, so I don't know.

MODERATOR:  Couple more questions? 


Q.  It was a big gallery out there and they seemed to be moving around a lot.  Have you gotten used to that in playing with Tiger before?

JIM FURYK: When things move, it's worse on Thursday morning when there is three people behind the tee, and if one person moves, you catch it pretty constant.  With that many people, it kind of blends in.  When Tiger birdied 15, 16, 17, things got pretty crazy out there.  There was a lot going on at that time, and you have to be patient, let things quiet down, and that's part of it.  I think when it's a big mass of people, I think it's a little easier than sticking a few people behind the tee. 


Q.  How significant would winning here be in preparation for the PGA?

JIM FURYK: It would be nice to have a good feeling like that, but I wouldn't put that much significance into it.  I've played very good here and had a good PGA.  I've played well here and had a very good PGA; did well a couple years ago and did well in the PGA.  It's nice.  With a week off in between, it's probably less significant this year than it was when it was a week before.  More than anything, it's just confidence, knowing your game is in good shape, knowing you're feeling pretty good about the way you're playing, but  it's not a huge deal.  I don't think there is too many people that have won this event and gone on to win the PGA next week.  I guess it probably doesn't mean that much. 

MODERATOR:  Thank you, Jim for joining us.
