Q.   Let's just get some comments on your round.   Nice playing today. 
JIM FURYK:   Well, obviously happy to shoot 66 and following it up with 63.   At times you go out there and fire a low score‑‑ one day it's hard to follow it up, the next and keep that momentum going.   But the fact that I did it in the afternoon yesterday, it's kind of quick.   You get a quick dinner, to sleep, right back out on the golf course in the morning.   So I was able to kind of keep that momentum, knocked in a couple good putts today and made some great saves actually, some good par saves to keep the round going.
