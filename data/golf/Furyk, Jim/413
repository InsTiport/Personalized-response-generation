Q.  Just talk about your round today.
JIM FURYK:  You know, good, solid start.  I wish I would have finished it off a little bit better, but I hung in there through some tough stretches down the end.  But early on, put the ball in position on the greens and I was able to knock in a bunch of putts, and I didn't do that yesterday.

I hit the ball beautifully yesterday, putted okay, but I never really got the putter going.  My first side was the back nine today, I shot 5 under, and it was basically because I knocked in a bunch of putts and that was fun to do.
Q.  You've had Top 10s in six of your last seven starts with a win in that period, so you are really swinging at it good.
JIM FURYK:  I've been happy with my performances.  The finishes, I'm actually not even aware of the finishes, but I had a chance to win at the last World Golf Championships, the Bridgestone I lost by one, took a week off, went up to Canada and won there.  It's been a good stretch and hopefully I can keep it up throughout the year.
