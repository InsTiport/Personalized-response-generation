 Q. Have you had any sense that he would play as well as he did, and to be able to accomplish what he accomplished?
 JIM FURYK: Well, no. I felt better about my game than what I've been playing this year, and I kind of -- I want to thank kind of my partners a little bit. I had Phil for three days, and he was playing great, he had a positive attitude. 
 I have a feeling that I'll probably see him in the media room later -- I have a feeling he probably asked to play with me because I felt like he could get a lot out of me; meaning that we have known each other for a long time, we are good friends, and he's got a great leadership quality in these events, and you know, I struggled this year and he kind of took me under his wing and kind of boosted my confidence. And I was able to kind of ride Nick Watney's coattails a little bit and crack the whip on the young guy.
 I didn't expect to play as well as I did, but it had to do a lot with my putting this week.
