Q.   Has this place grown on you a little bit?
JIM FURYK:   A little bit.   It's a severe golf course.   It's a lot of fun when it's calm.   The problem is it's never calm, so it's grueling.   The falloffs and some of the runâ€‘offs on the greens, I know some of them have been fixed, but it's a tough, grueling golf course in this kind of weather, and we played in it for four days.   It is, I finished well.   I have two top 10 finishes, and I've enjoyed playing here.   I played well.
