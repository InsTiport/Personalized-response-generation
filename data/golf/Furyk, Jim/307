   On hole 16-18...   
 JIM FURYK: When you get through 16 and 18 at even par you've definitely accomplished something. They are hard. Those are solid holes. Hole 17 is just a wreck waiting to happen. The green slopes away from you and going towards the water. You can hit some decent shots that turn out pretty bad out there. It's a good tough finish.  
 You know you have to play those holes every day and you just have to grind it out. I made a good birdie on 16.  
 I played well today and I'm pretty happy with my round. I got off to a bit of a rough start. I missed a 4-footer for birdie on the first hole and then I hit too much club on #2 and made bogey. I felt like I hadn't missed a shot and was 1 over par. I just kind of hung in there and had two real good streaks of birdies (6-8, 14-16 (eagle on 14). It was a tough day to score today.
