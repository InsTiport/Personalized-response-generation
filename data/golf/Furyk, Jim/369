  Q.  You said you got spanked, if you could elaborate a little bit.   
 TIGER WOODS:  They chipped in twice, 11-under par through 14 holes, that's pretty good playing.  Not like we were playing bad.  Jim and I were talking about, we shot 6-under but we played the same holes.  So evidently, you know, we needed to take it a lot deeper than that and we didn't do it.   
 JIM FURYK:  Yeah, my hat is off to the other team.  They played a good match, 11-under, they hit a lot of key shots.  They gave themselves a few more opportunities than we did and they capitalized on them.  We were in the hole early, so it's tough to kind of dig yourself out.  You know, we tried, we gave it a shot.  And we made some birdies, but they made a few more and a couple of eagles on us we ran into a tough match today and we didn't make enough birdies.   
  
  Q.  You birdied the same holes, not like you were playing bad; does that take the sting out as you look forward to Saturday?   
 TIGER WOODS:  Obviously we needed to make more birdies in our match.  As I said, we both played pretty good, I wouldn't say great, but we were playing solidly.  We just didn't get enough looks at birdies on the same hole.  It seemed like one of us was in on each hole and was making putts but we needed to have both of us in there on the same hole and we just didn't do that.   
  
  Q.  Following these guys, does it help keep you focussed and fired up?   
 JIM FURYK:  We want to support our teammates.  We lost our match, and even though neither one of us played badly it doesn't take the sting out of it.  Best we can do is support our teammates and hope they get some points.
