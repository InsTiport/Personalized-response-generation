Q.   That came awfully close to going in. 
JIM FURYK:   The crowd liked it, being such an elevated green, we can't see it but I was just hoping that as it rolled by the pin it didn't go too far back and I had a little kickâ€‘in left.   So not as much stress. 

Q.   Good round out there today for you. 
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, I feel good about it, six birdies, two bogies.   You know, made a couple mistakes here and there, but I really feel like my game has gotten stronger every day.   I feel more confident with the putter in my hand, and I'm seeing a couple more putts go in and I think that's giving me some confidence, as well, and that's why my scores are getting better.

Q.   Momentum is always a key to any low round or a player's momentum, how hard is it to keep momentum on this golf course? 
JIM FURYK:   It's tough.   It's tougher.   It's a tough golf course, you're going to make some mistakes I think.   You can't let those bogies bother you too much.   At times, I got off to a fast start today, and birdied 1 and 2 and had some putts lip out, and then made that birdie on 6, or bogey on 6, and you just can't let that bother you.   It was nice to turn it around and make a birdie on 8 the par 3 and keep things going. 

Q.   You're in good position.   Can't imagine the leaders get too far away. 
JIM FURYK:   They will be in sight.   Last I looked Justin was at 7 and that will be a couple back there.   Could end up being two, three, four back, but at least they are in sight and I need to fire a good one tomorrow.
