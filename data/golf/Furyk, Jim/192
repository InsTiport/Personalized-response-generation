 Q.   You've been playing this game a long time.   You had the lead for 71 holes.   Can you tell me, the average person doesn't get to go through what you've just been through.   What does it feel like?   
JIM FURYK:   Well, I think they realize when something happens in your life that you're working so hard, you're trying too hard, you're pushing too hard, you've worked so hard for, I have no one to blame but myself, but when things go wrong, it's an empty feeling.   I'm disappointed.   I walked over, my boy is crying right after the round, and I guess it reminds you as an adult, as a parent that you have to act the proper way.   You have to do and say the right things to try to give the right lessons.   
But there's no way I could have made any worse than 5 on the last hole, there's no way I could have done worse than a playoff.   Put the third shot on the green, that would have put a lot of pressure on him to make that putt and it would be a lot more difficult and it would have given me a 5‑ or 6‑footer, and then I hit the worst putt of the week.  
I'm just disappointed.   The thing I love about golf and this sport is that I have no one else to blame but myself, so I'll go to work tomorrow and (indiscernible.)
