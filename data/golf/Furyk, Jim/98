  JIM FURYK:   Yeah, I feel like I managed the damage, but I made too many bogeys today, probably about four bogeys out there.  
   
 Q.   Correct.   
JIM FURYK:   I made a couple good saves early in the round at 4 and 5.   And then after that struggled ‑‑ when I did hit an errant shot, I just struggled to either get the ball up‑and‑down or put it in places where I could get the ball up‑and‑down.   I made a few too many bogeys today, but the good news is I did hit enough good shots, gave myself some good opportunities, although in the middle of that round I didn't make a bunch of putts, I was able to get some to fall at the end.  
   
 Q.   You talked about the four bogeys, but you had five birdies.   That's a lot of birdies on this golf course.   
JIM FURYK:   I feel like it played tough today.   I felt like the pins were a little tougher to get to.   I felt like yesterday was a little bit more scorable, but I don't know, I felt like the greens maybe weren't quite as quick today, and I didn't adjust to the speed very well.   My speed on those big, breaking putts was off, and therefore it affected my line.  
   
 Q.   You know what it takes to win the FedExCup, former champion here.   What will it take on the weekend for you?  
JIM FURYK:   I think two real solid rounds.   I'm still within earshot.   I'll be probably about four shots off the lead, and in order to win, I've got to win the golf tournament first, so I don't really worry about how the FedEx plays out because I realize it's all about how I played in this golf tournament.   Tomorrow will be a day to go out there and hopefully fire a good enough round and get myself in real good shape for Sunday.
