  Q.  Obviously a long day, but a good day for you; you worked yourself into contention here.   
 JIM FURYK:  Yeah, I had a good day yesterday, and I came back this morning, finished up the round with two more birdies, got myself in the hunt, and then had a couple early slips today.  I had a bad bogey at 2, wrong club, knocked it over the green, and three-putt on 3 and I was pretty disappointed with myself.   
 It looked like it was going to rain, and I turned around and birdied 5, 6, 7 and 8, so got myself back in the hunt and left one hanging on the edge on 9 and just missed about a six-, seven-, eight-footer on 10 for birdie.   
 But I'm playing pretty good.  I'm glad it didn't rain and we got some golf in because I made a bunch of birdies and kind of got myself back in the tournament.   
  
  Q.  Is it weird on a day like this?  Does it feel like a Sunday?  Does it feel like you're in the hunt at the end of this event?   
 JIM FURYK:  It's just tiring.  Coming in and then driving back out, not even getting to play a hole, driving back in.  I warmed up four times today.  I'm pretty spent, pretty tired, and I get to wake up at 5:30 and do it all over again tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Any strategy or thoughts going into tomorrow's round?  Obviously Geoff is playing great, Vijay is up there?   
 JIM FURYK:  I haven't really seen the score.  The last I saw, Geoff was 17, and I'm a couple back.  If I want to win the golf tournament I'm going to have to make a bunch of birdies again tomorrow.
