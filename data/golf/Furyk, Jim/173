 Q.   Jim, second consecutive 69.   Can I just get some comments on your round?  
JIM FURYK:   Yeah.   Yesterday I said that I scored really well and I got the ball around well.   Today I didn't putt quite as well as I did yesterday.   I still felt it was solid, but I felt a little bit better about my ball striking and when you kind of add it up, it's the same score.   So a little better off from the long game.   Maybe not quite as crisp with the putter, but overall still a good score, keeps me in the golf tournament.  
   
 Q.   Looks like these conditions are around for the week.   How were they out there today for you?  
JIM FURYK:   Well, I was surprised that the golf course was a lot more wet today than it was yesterday.   So they must have got a lot of rain overnight.   
It's quite soggy out there.   It's saturated.   There's a lot of standing water, and a swish under your feet when you're walking around.   So hopefully we get a little bit of a dry night and give it a chance to dry up a little bit.
