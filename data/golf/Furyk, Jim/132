 Q.   A lot of holes today in tough conditions.   How would you describe your day?  
JIM FURYK:   Pretty good, really.   I came out this morning and played 3â€‘under my last ten holes.  
And then I struggled to get it going on the front nine today, where I shot even par in relatively benign conditions.   And then I saw that that wind was going to pick up.   I knew that the finish today was going to be tough.   But I hung in there on the back nine, shot even par.   
I felt like it was a good day.   I needed to putt a little better.   The first 10 to 12 holes today I let a few shots go, and didn't really capitalize on opportunities.   But I kind of gutted it out and played pretty well in the wind.   
   
 Q.   A guy that's had a lot of success, Luke Donald, is on top of the leaderboard right now.   
JIM FURYK:   Well, he's got a lot of experience.   Former No.1 player in the world.   He's had a lot of success here and likes it here, and I can see why.   It really suits his game.  
I think it's going to be a very windy, tough day tomorrow.   I think that also suits him.   He'll be a tough guy to catch.   
   
 Q.   What's the mindset going into tomorrow, catching Luke?  
JIM FURYK:   It's going to be a tough day.   It's supposed to blow.   It's supposed to be very windy tomorrow.   It's been like that all week, but I hear it's going to actually pick up tomorrow from what we saw today.   So even par is probably a good score, anything under par might have a chance.   And put some heat on the leaders.  
Luke has a lot of experience.   He's playing well.   He's played well on this course in the past.   And he's really good in the wind and that style.   I think he'll be a tough guy to catch.
