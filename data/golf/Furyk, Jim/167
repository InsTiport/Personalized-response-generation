  JIM FURYK:   I don't mind taking a week off before a major, but I didn't want to take two.   A couple of things led to me playing here rather than Houston.   I would say first and foremost, Houston is a high, right‑to‑left, bombing golf course, and I'm not any of those three, so that takes me out.   This golf course I was told was more about placing the ball, and I heard it was severe around the greens.   But it seemed like ‑‑ I had some guys say that I think it might suit your style better. 
Then my kids had spring break last week, and I can't remember the last time I wasn't playing over spring break.   So this might be the first time since they've been in school that I was off during spring break.   So we had fun.   We went on a little vacation, and I was able to spend some time with the family which I needed.

Q.   Where did you go? 
JIM FURYK:   We had a whirlwind, actually.   We were supposed to go to two places.   We were going to go out to Deer Valley, Park City area, a place that we love, and my boy broke his collarbone, so that took skiing out.   So we spent a little time down in St. Pete, Clearwater area, and it was cold.   My son loves the Yankees, so for him we went and watched a spring training game.   My wife went to Ohio State and I went to Arizona, and they played each other in L.A. on Thursday.   I went to that game with my wife and kids, and we had already planned to go to Cabo for four or five days and meet my parents, so we had a great time down there.

Q.   Did he break his collarbone on vacation? 
JIM FURYK:   No, he did it a couple of weeks ago.   Probably three or four weeks ago now.
