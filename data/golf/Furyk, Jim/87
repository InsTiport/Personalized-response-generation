 Q.   Nice round out there today.   
JIM FURYK:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   The weather couldn't be any better, could it?  
JIM FURYK:   It's as good as it gets.   
   
 Q.   No bogeys on the card today.   Talk about your 7â€‘under round.   
JIM FURYK:   Felt pretty good.   First round of the year, I kind of pleasantly surprised to go out there with really no expectations, try to figure out where my game was at.   
But I got in a really good rhythm in my swing early in the round.   I felt that I hit a bunch of fairways, really hit the ball solid, just gave myself a lot of opportunities and was able to save a couple pars when I needed to and made a bunch of putts today.   
So, I think sometimes that no expectations is a good thing, you go out there and just kind of see where you're at and I really never got ahead of myself today and it was nice to go out there and play well.  
   
 Q.   Anything in particular you worked on in the off season?  
JIM FURYK:   Not really.   I had a really good solid season last year and I feel like there was things in probably in the back of my mind this last month but really November and December I got away a lot, I got away a lot from golf.   I played when I had to and but it was outings or different things, but the last month I really just tried to get back to the basics of what I was doing really well last year and tried to compliment that and add to it.  
   
 Q.   Have you seen any better weather here on the Monterey peninsula?  
JIM FURYK:   I've seen days this good, but they're far and few between.   So to have weather like this now it's supposed to be like this all week, it is absolutely incredible.   So, it's already one of the most beautiful places I've been to, or one of the most beautiful places I've been to and then to have weather like this, it's just spectacular this week.
