 Q.   Jim, a solid round on a tough golf course.   
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, I'm actually surprised at the scores.   The greens are quite soft out there.   This morning we didn't have a lot of win.   I thought the pins were in some tough spots and they definitely picked up some speed from yesterday.   If this wind keeps blowing they're going to be very quick this afternoon.   My group rolled a bunch of putts by 4, 5, 6 or 7 feet, and I think it kind of caught us by surprise today.   I'm a little surprised with the conditions that the scores weren't a little better this morning.  
   
 Q.   Isn't that the story always here?   You look at the card and look at yardages and you think it's there.   Especially this morning,   I saw the greens very receptive all day long, yet as you mentioned, the scores are nothing exotic?  
JIM FURYK:   The greens have to be receptive.   You know, the grass down here in this heat, if they don't keep some water on them, they're going to burn out.   But you can look at that card all you want and look at yardage and however you face it.   I have a lot of respect for this golf course.   I think it's a very, very good golf course.   When the wind blows, it's tough to score.   When the wind lays down, we have a shot, especially when the greens ‑‑ when we see the shot.   But that wasn't the case this earning month.   We'll see, maybe the scores will be a little better this afternoon.
