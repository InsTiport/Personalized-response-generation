 Q.   Nice start to the tournament for you.   
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, happy to get out there and get a good number under my belt.   The greens were pretty soft.   The golf course was out there for the taking.   Didn't get as breezy as I think they predicted, but it's still a hard golf course.   It's still hard to score on.  
   
 Q.   You did a good job off the tee.   
JIM FURYK:   I felt good about that.   I put the ball in play a lot.   On my second side on the front, I hit some really crisp iron shots, set up a bunch of birdies there at 1, 2 and 3.   Had a bunch of other putts that didn't go in, so I gave myself a lot of opportunities there.  
   
 Q.   Did the greens stay receptive throughout the day?  
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, they really did.   As soft as they were Monday and Tuesday, and then we got a bunch of rain all day yesterday, I don't really see them firming up for a while.   Maybe late in the week or Sunday, but for right now I think they're going to be pretty receptive the rest of the week.
