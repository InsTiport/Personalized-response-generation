 Q. Really nice position going into the weekend.
 JIM FURYK: It was playing real good for me with 3-under today. Yeah, I did -- the pin placements are a little tougher. I'm not sure what it was but it doesn't look like the scores are moving, the cut is moving as quickly as I thought.

 Q. You've gotten it all done on the first nine, couple of birdies, couple bogies on the second nine.
 Is that how you have to attack this golf course, get it early for the weekend?
 JIM FURYK: I'm going to have to play the back-9 better if I want an opportunity. I'm 8-under on front, even par on the back. I've had a couple slip ups, missed a couple short putts on the back-9. That's my bogies. 
 And I've also kind of ruined that 15th hole two days in a row but I've made great saves and pars. Kind of kept my round going. I need to play the par-5s a little bit better. I'm happy with where I'm at.

 Q. As you should be. You have an opportunity to become the first player to complete the Carolina Slam, the tournaments in South Carolina and North Carolina.
 JIM FURYK: Okay. Two in North Carolina and we have the Hilton Head. That would be nice. I wouldn't mind having that, adding to it my list.

 Q. Wouldn't mind having your name on the trophy here.
 JIM FURYK: Thanks.
