   JIM FURYK: First and foremost the goal to go out and play a good round of golf tomorrow and win the golf tournament.

 Q. How do you make sure you keep it through tomorrow?
 JIM FURYK: It's going to be real easy tonight. No one is allowed to play any golf. I'm not quite sure I understand the question.

 Q. How do you make sure you stay ahead of the pack and see this one through?
 JIM FURYK: Actually I would think that's the wrong way to look at it. The idea isn't to stay ahead. The idea is just to go out there and play a good round of golf, fire a good number, make them do something spectacular. Instead of worrying about, if you go out there and just try to make pars or just trying to break 80 -- first-time golfer trying to break 80, how about trying to shoot 75. The idea tomorrow is to go out there and play a good round of golf and do the best I can.

 Q. When you do have the lead, how do you relax? 
 JIM FURYK: It's not much of an issue. I sleep fine. I've got my family in town. I've got a lot on my mind packing for the Ryder Cup, and also there's a bunch of college football on today and some really good games this afternoon. I'd really like to go see them. I think I've got football tonight, and the early start tomorrow helps because you don't have to sit around all morning.
