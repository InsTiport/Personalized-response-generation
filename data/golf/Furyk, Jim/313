 Q. Obviously disappointing end to the round, but some good things to build on? 
 JIM FURYK: Well, disappointed that I made bogey, but it could have been double. I had a good up-and-down. Definitely kept me in a good frame of mind. I just couldn't -- my start was not as good as it needed to be. The ones on the front side, I think you can get a little help here on the front. 
 I had some wedges in my hand at 7,8, didn't make any birdies, and you know, would have liked to have got it going a little quicker. Played the back nine really well, 3-under coming into 18 and made bogey there. But the hole is playing tough. 
 I wanted to make up some ground and give myself a chance tomorrow, and I did a pretty good job. There's a couple of guys that are separating themselves, so wait and see how they finish up. 

 Q. A course you played well at and finished well at here last year. Is this a course that you're liking these days? 
 JIM FURYK: I do. I've always liked it here. I've won here in the past and lost in a playoff. I had my opportunities last year. 
 I always enjoy coming to Doral. I've played here probably -- I've probably played 14 times in this event out of 16 years on TOUR, so I enjoy coming.
