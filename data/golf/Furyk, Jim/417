JIM FURYK:  10 6 is an awful long way to come back from, but we've done it before.  We need to regroup and obviously we need to play real well tomorrow as a team.
Q.  Tiger, how difficult has it been continuously being behind in the matches?

TIGER WOODS:  Well, it's tough.  We're not only down in the overall matches, but we're always down it seems within the first five, six holes in just about every single match.

This format is really tough to come back because it's only 18 holes and you don't have a lot of time.  It's imperative that we as a team get off to a quick start like we did in '99.  In '99 I think we had six matches that we were up early and got points early, and hopefully we can do the same tomorrow.
Q.  You've taken on a leadership role in this Ryder Cup in the weeks leading up to it.  Is there anything you can do to inspire this team?

TIGER WOODS:  Well, I need to get my point tomorrow and the rest of the guys need to do the same.  It's imperative that we get together as a whole collectively and play well as a team.

You know, the Europeans are playing great, so we need to go out there and obviously beat them.  They're not going to give it to us.  We've got to beat them.
Q.  Jim, do you think you might be asked to go first out, happy to do that tomorrow?

JIM FURYK:  I'll be happy to do whatever Tom says, the captain says.  We're having a team meeting right now and I'm sure we'll discuss that.  I have no idea what the plan is right now, but I'll answer the call, wherever he puts me.
