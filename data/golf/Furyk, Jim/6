 Q.  Really nice play today.  Can you give us an overall assessment for the 4-under?  
JIM FURYK: Yeah, I needed to come out today and play a solid round.  At one point I was 4-over par yesterday.  I made a couple birdies on 16 and 17 yesterday and was able to salvage the round and shoot 2-over.  And I think that finish the last six holes yesterday I played very well, and that allowed me to kind of get out there today and kind of build off of it.   
I found something in my setup.  Something I keyed on.  Hit some solid shots.  And I was able to make some putts going early on.  A couple putts didn't go in.  I made six birdies, but I think the key to my round was that 8, 9, 10 stretch where I had to get up-and-down on both 8 and 9 for par, made some good, solid, relatively long par putts and was able to make birdie on 10.  Getting through in 1-under and only hitting one green was key.   
 Q.  You're playing Pebble.  Of course it's a totally different thing, how is it different for you?  
JIM FURYK: A lot firmer and faster.  The amount of club that we're hitting.  For instance, I wanted to play 18 aggressive yesterday, and that meant hitting 3-wood off the tee and 5-wood to the green.  I've laid up a lot with 3-wood during the AT&T.  Today I played conservative, 5-wood and 5-iron and gap wedge.   
So the golf course is playing a touch shorter in spots.  But that run-out at 9, that run-out at 10, that causes trouble, as well.  A little firmer, a little faster.   
I think the golf course is in great shape, and the fact that it's overcast, cloudy, it's maintaining enough moisture that guys can stop the ball.  There is an opportunity to score out there and shoot a pretty good number.
