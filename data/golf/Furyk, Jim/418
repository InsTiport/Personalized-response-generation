Q.  How do you feel about getting the first point?
JIM FURYK:  It's a great feeling.  Obviously we were put out there in a position just like Colin and Padraig trying to win the first point for our team, trying to go out there and do that.  We probably didn't play our best golf, all four of us, but we're happy with what we accomplished and we got a lot of work ahead of us.  We have a tough match this afternoon and we just need to focus on playing good golf and putting pressure on the other team.
Q.  Why do you think you and Tiger make such a great pair?
JIM FURYK:  We get along real well.  I enjoy his company, and I think when we go out there and play, he enjoys playing with me.
Q.  Do your games go together pretty well?
JIM FURYK:  I think so.  He has a lot more power than I do, and we attack golf courses a little differently because of that.  We do have very similar styles outside of that, and because of his length and maybe because of my little bit more control keeping it in the fairway, we have some differences, but we also have some similarities that will help us there.
