  Q. Jim, you seemed to dig yourself a little bit of a hole there on 7 and 8. Talk about that.   
 JIM FURYK: I dug myself a hole on the front nine and on the back. I played very poor golf today. I felt like I was actually relatively prepared for the day and hitting the ball pretty well. I got loose with quite a few shots. My short game was absolutely horrible and my score was way, way, over par. Your can't win matches that way.   
 We both played loose but I had no business winning match. I still made a lot of mistakes down the stretch and could have put myself in a position to win.  
  
  Q. What do you attribute that to?   
 JIM FURYK: I thought I just went through that, but I attribute it to my short game. I wasn't able to get the ball up or down for birdie or par when I needed to. I had a few pitch shots where I pitched it over the green. I left a couple short or I dumped them. I didn't get the ball up-and-down when I needed to, just didn't even give myself an opportunity with the putter today. I was just bad with the short game.
