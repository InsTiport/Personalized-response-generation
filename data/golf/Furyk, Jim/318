  Q. Not the way you wanted to finish the round, but talk about the round in general and also the week.   
 JIM FURYK: Well, obviously I was in position to win the golf tournament all week, and I played pretty poorly. At this moment there's probably nothing positive I could say. I'm pretty bitter. I'm mad at myself, and I just -- I struggled with my swing the last two days and then finally under pressure it showed up. I'm not striking the ball solid, and I had a lot of time off, and I managed to get the ball around the golf course for most of the way. I had two three-putts on the front nine.  
 So just disappointed in the week. There's a lot of places on this golf course where you can make birdies or you can make triple bogeys, and I found some big numbers on the way in.
