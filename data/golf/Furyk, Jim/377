 Q.  Were you thinking that was possible or did you know with the wind -- 
 JIM FURYK:  I didn't really worry about it.  I know it was a good round but you can't focus on what everyone else is doing and how someone else played.  Obviously, you know, this afternoon was I'm sure the scores will be a little bit higher this afternoon than they were this morning. 
 Hopefully we get our turn tomorrow and get some calm weather in the morning and hopefully we can get it going.  Always you can do is focus on your game and I was just trying to plug along and get it in the hole as quick as could. 

 Q.  What kind of effect did the wind have? 
 JIM FURYK:  Quite a bit.  It was blowing pretty good.  The forecast was only eight or nine miles an hour, but it sure felt more than that, especially somewhere around 3 o'clock today.  It was humming pretty good. 

 Q.  How are you feeling fatigue-wise coming off of last week? 
 JIM FURYK:  I'm all right.  I feel fine.  I have no excuses and feel pretty good, and the charter actually helped quite a bit and got us back here a day earlier than we would have been.
