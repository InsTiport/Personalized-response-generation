  Q.  On the course conditions.   

 JIM FURYK:  I'm still in it.  I'm a little mad at myself.  There's a good chance tomorrow, I'm four back.  A lot of guys will look at it and say, "What could have been."    

 When I had the opportunities to make birdies I turned it into a bogey.   

 I'm a little mad at myself, but I'll regroup and look at the positives.  I'm hearing it's supposed to be windy tomorrow.  Coming from 10 players in front of me, tough conditions is probably what I would like.  I'm hoping the conditions and course will be tough tomorrow.  That is as tough as I've seen here.   
  
  Q.  The set-up of the golf course.   

 JIM FURYK:  It's a big drastic change.  When you have a drastic change, you'll have opinions across the board.  The only thing they can't control at the Masters is the weather.   

 This tournament will look different in the upcoming years, you won't be seeing a lot of eagles and birdies any more.   

 This course was more fun to play 10 years ago and it's more difficult to play now.  It's supposed to play difficult.   

 Tonight I'll put negatives behind me and look at the positives.   

 I don't think players really mind the scores.  You want to play a difficult golf course.   

 But you want a course that rewards a good shot.  If it rewards good shots, the scores don't really matter.
