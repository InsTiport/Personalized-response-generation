 Q.
Jim, looks like you're getting your 14th top-ten finish of the year.  At this point is that encouraging or do you feel like you left a few out there today? 
 
JIM FURYK:  Well, I always leave a few out there.  I always look at what could have been, but I really wasn't on top of my game this week and I could have struck the ball better, but for what I did, for where I hit it, the position I put myself in off the tee most of the week, I played pretty well.  I just didn't hit the ball well enough or actually putt well enough from 15 or 20 feet to really be a serious factor.


Q.  How did you feel about the course this week?  Is this a course you still enjoy playing?

JIM FURYK:  It's one of my favorites.  It's in my top five every year.  I love coming here.  I missed it last year, although we played at a great golf course in the Pacific Northwest.  I love Firestone and Akron.  It's a great event to be qualified for and I've been lucky enough to be for a long time and I've had some success here and maybe that adds to it.
