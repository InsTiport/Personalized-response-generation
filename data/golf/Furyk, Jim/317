 Q. What did you learn about your game last week? 
 JIM FURYK: A little rusty. I didn't trust myself enough in spots. I made a few bad things that really cost me a lot for the tournament. Overall, I played relatively solid. My putting wasn't quite where I needed it to be, and again, I think my trust in my full swing was not quite where it needed to be but overall it was a relatively solid week.

 Q. Riviera, a place that almost everybody seems to like but for different reasons. What do you like about this place? 
 JIM FURYK: Not the traffic. Not the traffic. I don't think anyone is going to say that. 
 I would say, I love old, traditional golf courses. It's a good, classic course. You have to think your way around and you have to hit some shots. I think it's just a lot of fun to play. 

 Q. And if something -- if your game is a little different that week, you can still find a way to score. You don't have to hit it long and straight and find every fairway, and you don't have to be perfect around the greens, sometimes, if another part of your game is working. A lot of ways to score, I guess, is what I'm getting at. 
 JIM FURYK: There is. But I just love the -- I always say if it was built before 1960, there's a good chance I'm going to like it. If it was built after 1990, there's probably a pretty good chance I won't. It doesn't always hold true, but it's a good rule of thumb. 
 They have tweaked it here and face-listed it there, but it's really withstood the test of time. We've had major championships here and obviously a really good course. 
 The kikuyu is a little different, but I don't mind it. I've played a lot here and also over in South Africa on it, and I'm relatively comfortable but it adds another dimension.
