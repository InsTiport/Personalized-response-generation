Q.
I know it wasn't the finish you wanted, but you're right there.
JIM FURYK:  Yeah, you're right, it wasn't.  I hit some really good shots coming in and still made two bogeys.  One of the best drives of the day was 18, and I hit it right down the middle and hit a sprinkler head on the fly and couldn't figure out why it shot over to the right but still ended up in the shortcut of the rough, and I played a little bit of a dumb shot for the second shot and ended up getting through the green and making bogey.

I shouldn't have bogeyed 16 and 1, but that happens.  I knocked in some good putts at 14 and 15 for birdie.  I guess overall I'm over the bogeys now.  A little hot for about five minutes after my round, but I get over that and look at the bright side, I'm a couple shots back.

It's supposed to rain tonight, conditions are supposed to get soft and it'll probably be a shootout tomorrow.  I'll get prepared and try and get some sleep tonight.  I haven't had a tee time before noon this week, so 9:20 is going to be a little bit of a shock.
Q.
It doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of low scores out there today.
JIM FURYK:  It was set up much firmer and faster today.  The fairways were firmer, which always makes it more difficult to get the ball in the fairway here, and the greens were firmer and faster today, without a doubt.  You could see the balls    when iron shots hit, they released a lot more today, which makes it more difficult to hit greens, makes it more difficult to get the ball close to the pin, and the greens were rolling quite a bit faster today.

Plus the leaders go out and you have more of the field out there on the greens ahead of time.  They're in great shape, but you still have the traffic ahead of you playing.  When the golf course gets set up firm and fast, that's when the scores go up.
Q.
Maybe rain will be welcome?
JIM FURYK:  I wouldn't say that.  A lot of times you can make up more shots in the firmer, faster conditions.  If you play a good round    someone shot a low round today.  Casey maybe?  Cink shot a low round.  You can go from relatively a decent spot in the tournament, he shot 5  or 6 under and all of a sudden he's leading the event.

I like those firm, fast conditions, but tomorrow it's going to be a little bit more of a shootout.  If we get the rain, if it gets softer, and again, if it doesn't get windy, a lot of times that front blows in with the rain, the scores won't be all that good.  But if it's calm out here and soft, someone will go out and fire a low number.
Q.
How does a guy make four bogeys in a row and he's still right there?
JIM FURYK:  Well, he started ahead of everyone.  That helps.  It's hard to start four behind and make four bogeys in a row and be right there.
Q.
Just the mentality of not losing it out there.
JIM FURYK:  Well, I think you don't expect a guy of his caliber to go out there and make those bogeys, but also, a true test of the character is at that point    what did he start the day, at 9, he's back to 5, Davis at one time is at 11, he keeps chipping away, keeps chipping away, I don't know what he finished at, but I saw him at 8 with one hole to play.  He'll be right there tied for the lead or one or two back and he's got himself right in position again.  Even though it wasn't a good day he hung around, and that's what you have to do.
Q.
Do you have to have a different mindset if you think it's going to be a shootout right off the bat?
JIM FURYK:  No, you go out there and play as hard as you can.  If you start trying to hit shots and being impatient it'll jump up and bite you.  The golf course is too difficult.  You have to stay within yourself and think about how you're going to put the ball in the fairway, how you're going to put the ball on the green with an opportunity to make a putt and hopefully you make some putts, but if you try to force things it will bite you.
Q.
The hole in one yesterday, did that carry over any?
JIM FURYK:  A little bit, but then I turned around and missed like a foot and a half putt on 17, and I was a little disappointed in myself.  Where I really got it going yesterday was on the front side, my second side I went and I made about an eight footer at 1 for birdie and I hit three iron shots within about three feet on the back side, so I had about three holes    I actually two putted on 2 but I had three iron shots inside three feet.  I kind of got it going with my irons yesterday and got myself in good position.
Q.
You obviously have good memories of the shootout here.  You have to feel good going into the final day.
JIM FURYK:  I've had a lot of good finishes here at Akron.  I like the golf course.  That's probably the most positive.  It's one of my Top 5 courses that we get to play all year, and I like the layout.  It's in good shape this year as it usually is, but it's in very, very good shape this year.  It's nice coming back to a place where you're excited about playing the golf course.
