  Q. Jim, nice playing, you missed three fairways and three greens, 28 putts.   
 JIM FURYK: Thanks. Nothing exciting today. No birdies, no bogeys. No wind out there and very gettable spins so I can understand how the scores are so low.   
  
  Q. With no wind out here, does that change your angles into the green and the way you approach shots?  
 JIM FURYK: Well, you can be a lot more aggressive obviously and it's just -- this golf course, when it's blowing, it's blowing. There's nothing to stop it; 15 miles an hour here is a lot. If it's blowing trade downwind, all of a sudden 180 yards is playing 140 and 140 is playing 180. So it makes it very difficult to get the ball closer to the pin.  
 But today it was kind of a free ticket to fire at the pin.   
  
  Q. You have a house here but don't spend too much time here. Do you feel at home on this golf course like you have an advantage?  
 JIM FURYK: I don't know if I have an advantage. I do feel comfortable. I haven't played the event or the course since 2008. Kind of hopped right back in. You don't always have to hit the most perfect golf shots here. You kind of have to think your way around, and as long as you hit a couple good drives and key shots here and there, chip-and-putt and get the ball in the hole, you can score pretty well here.
