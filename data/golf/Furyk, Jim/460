JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  15 greens today, 1 under.  Just didn't get it close to the hole, the putts weren't going in, a combination of both?
JIM FURYK:  I probably had a better opportunity today to shoot a good score, as good an opportunity today as I've had all week.  I kept trying, but it just wasn't going in the hole for me.

The Front 9, I had some opportunities.  I missed a short birdie at 6 and bogeyed 7.  Still shot even par.  On the back, had good opportunities at 14, 15, 16, just couldn't get one to go in.  I was trying, but it didn't work out.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN: Kind of a continuation of good play that started in the off season with winning in South Africa?
JIM FURYK:  Yeah.  But, you know, I took some time off, felt a little rusty actually Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week.  I really wasn't happy with my game.  Kind of worked on a few things Wednesday night.  It came around.

Definitely happy with the consistency this week.  Try to build on it.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  As far as going over to play the Sony Open, much different golf course there?
JIM FURYK:  Totally.  It will be a big adjustment.  This is a big, wide open golf course, a lot of slope, a lot of undulation, wide fairways, wind.

There, narrow bowling alley fairways, kind of flat greens but very, very quick.  There's a lot of opposites other than where we're in Hawaii.  But both good golf courses.  A lot of fun in both places.  I look forward to it.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Steelers going to win today?
JIM FURYK:  Kept getting updates on the golf course, so it was fun.
