 Q.   Thank you, Jim Furyk, right in the mix here at The McGladrey Classic.   Not having played since the Ryder Cup, did you expect to come out and really put up again a performance much like you've done all year?  
JIM FURYK:   You know what, I didn't really know what to expect.   I took a bunch of time off.   I only played three rounds of golf in those two weeks, and I played well when I did play, but I felt a little rusty on the way in.   
I felt mechanically I was hitting the ball on the range.   I have a lot of confidence in my ball striking right now, but you know, when you don't play a lot, sometimes it's the course management, making the good decisions.   And so far that's all kind of coming back to me slowly and I've kind of gained momentum as the last two rounds have gone on.  
   
 Q.   This seems like the type of golf course that's TaylorMade for you, having to keep the ball in play, making sure that you're in the right spot.   Do you approach this golf course that way and how do you feel about the way that you can attack the golf course?  
JIM FURYK:   I agree.   I agree.   That's one of the reasons ‑‑ there's a bunch of reasons I come up here.   It's beautiful.   Davis is a good friend.   But of course, I love the golf course, too.   It suits my style of game.   It's a fun golf course to play.   And as you said, you gotta keep the ball in the fairway, you gotta keep it in play, and there's some awkward‑looking tee shots.   From the tee the fairway looks tiny.   When you get out there, there's plenty of room.   It looks at times more difficult than it is, and sometimes that makes it hard to make a good shot.  
   
 Q.   You made it look easy so far.   Jim Furyk, good playing.
