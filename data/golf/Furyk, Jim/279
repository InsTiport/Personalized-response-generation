   JIM FURYK: He's tough. He's a good friend of mine, but he's a real tough competitor. Usually doesn't make a bunch of mistakes. And I actually got the better end of a couple of mistakes at the end. And I feel bad that's the way the match ended. 
 But he's a tough draw and always a grinder and a tough guy and kind of a similar game as me. So I think that always makes it interesting. 

 Q. How's the golf course playing as compared to last year?
 JIM FURYK: I think the conditions are similar. It's beautiful out. The weather is good. The ball is going a long way. They've softened the greens, and done a bit of work on the golf course, so it's all positive. It's similar to what I remember last year. When you go back and you look at your yardage books and compare, you can see that stuff has flattened out. There's a lot more room to put some pins on the greens. I think all the changes were positive. But the weather conditions, I think the distance the ball is traveling, is very similar to last year.

 Q. You went to the University of Arizona, do you get some good support when you come back here?
 JIM FURYK: Absolutely. Absolutely. It's good to have the hometown crowd pulling for you. I have a lot of good memories at U of A. We had some good golf teams. I don't get back as much as I'd like but when I do I sure get a lot of support and I appreciate it.
