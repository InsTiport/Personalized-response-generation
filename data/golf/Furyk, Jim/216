  Q. A few people may have questioned this pairing; why did it work today?   
 PHIL MICKELSON: We played together in '99 at The Ryder Cup. We played very well together. We felt like for years, we have been wanting to partner up again, and the last few years, there have been some young guys that we wanted to get both he and I out with, and this year, we feel like our young guys are ready to play with each other or want to play with each other and are going to play well with each other, which they are.   
 That gave Jim and I a chance to do what we have been wanting to do for a few years.  
  
  Q. Both of you have been pretty vocal that you have not putted very well this year, but it definitely was not the case today; why, Jim?   
 JIM FURYK: I don't know. I've been back working with the short putter, been working on it at home a little bit and just needed to see it go in early just to get some confidence.  
 But my partner over here, I felt good with an iron in my hand. I knew I didn't have to hit it five feet. He was rolling the ball in the hole today.
