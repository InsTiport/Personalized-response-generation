Q.   On an afternoon where the golf course kind of extracted a little bit from the players, you managed a bogey‑free round which was some superb playing.   Take us through your round. 
JIM FURYK:   Yeah, I appreciate it.   I hit some bad wedges at 1,   3 and 5, didn't give myself good birdie opportunities on those holes but I said all week those holes, 6 through 12 are pretty difficult. 
I gave myself a lot of really good birdie opportunities through that stretch and wasn't able to convert and make a lot of putts.   Just really played patient today, bided my time and was able to make birdies at 18 and 16 and turned into a really solid round.

Q.   You're right there with a chance tomorrow, and so much to play for at this time of year, Ryder Cup, the Playoffs, your first win; with all that stuff buzzing around, how do you but that aside tomorrow? 
JIM FURYK:   I've been in this position a few times this year.   Played good rounds at Wells Fargo and The PLAYERS on Sunday.   Shot 1‑under at Canada and got chased down by Tim Clark but I've been in the position before this year.   It's still fresh in my mind and I think that will actually make it a little easier to just stay patient and not really worry what's going on around me. 
There are a ton of players within three shots of the lead, so my goal really is to go out there and kind of not look at the leaderboard, just go play my own game, my own style and hopefully get that putter a little hotter earlier today.
16 pars, two birdies doesn't sound like an exciting round but it was good enough to actually move up the leaderboard and get myself in a good spot for tomorrow. 

Q.   Do you have a number in mind tomorrow?
JIM FURYK:   No, it's a stacked leaderboard.   There's a lot of players tight.   Just going to go out and try to fire a good number and play the best I can.
