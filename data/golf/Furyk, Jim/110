Q.   Heading into tomorrow, you're still in the Top 15; what are your goals? 
JIM FURYK:   It's a little too early to think about it.   Right now I'm just disappointed.   I was one back on Saturday and now I'm five and have at least a dozen guys ahead of me.   So realistically, this isn't a golf course where a guy my length is going to go out there and shoot 62, and it looks like the rest of the field is going to shoot 66 or 67. 
Realistically, the way the golf course is set up, it's going to be very difficult for me to fire a low enough number to win the golf tournament.   But I'll go out and shoot as good a number as I can and see where it falls. 

Q.   Any of that help build momentum for the FedEx and the Playoffs and then The Ryder Cup? 
JIM FURYK:   Well, the fact that I just played my last 14 rounds under par and been playing great; this one probably was a momentum killer.   But we'll regroup and get it going the other way.   Just disappointed.   The golf course, it's just not‑‑ you know, a guy like me is hoping for very, very firm, fast conditions.   We got here, it was really soft, and all the rain has made it a really long golf course.   It's definitely stressing me out a touch.
