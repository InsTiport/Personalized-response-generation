 Q.  Talk about yesterday? 

 JIM FURYK:  I didn't play that poorly.  I wasn't able to manage the way I wanted to. 

 Today I hit a lot of greens.  Didn't putt very well.  Honestly, I don't think I can strike it as well as I did today.  I need to make more putts.  I only missed one green. 

 Q.  About the course. 

 JIM FURYK:  There's not much wind.  Pin placements weren't quite as severe as yesterday. 

 17th and 18th the greens were looking glassy already.  I've only made three birdies in two days.  I didn't convert a lot of opportunities today. 

 It was cold this morning.  If it's sunny like this, and not a lot of wind, then the temperatures won't be a big deal.  You get a little wind and a little cold it's going to be tough.
