 Q.   Jim Furyk obviously knows how to play well here at Quail Hollow.   How good was that round by you today?   
JIM FURYK:   I felt good about it.   Put the ball in play a lot, hit a lot of greens, wish I could have got one more down the stretch, 16, 17, 18.   I had a 3‑putt back at No. 10 that ends up being a thorn in my side, but it was a really good finish.   It was nice to get on again and get the blood flowing.   I felt like at Augusta and Hilton Head I got close to contention.   I wasn't happy with the way I putted the golf ball.   I felt like I putted it beautifully today when I switched to a new putter, a new Odyssey that I loved, and I'm looking forward to using it here for the next couple of weeks.   
   
 Q.   Was it a difficult wait in the locker room?   
JIM FURYK:   It is.   Once J.B. birdied 15 I felt like, okay, it's time to pack up, it's a 3‑shot lead with 3 to go, but 16, 17, 18, a lot can happen.   The bogey at 16, the clutch putt was the one at 17, if he misses that one, it's a whole new ballgame coming up 18, but I know he was probably dieing a million deaths out there but he sucked it up and made a good 2‑putt at that hole, and made that last putt with authority and knocked it right in the middle.   
   
 Q.   Thanks, Jim.
