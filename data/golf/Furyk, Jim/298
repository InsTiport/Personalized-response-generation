 Q. Nice round, 4-under par. You had three great looks at it coming in. How is the golf course playing?
 JIM FURYK: You know, it's playing well. Right now it's soft, which makes it easy to get the ball in the fairway. It makes it a little easier to get aggressive with our iron shots, and that's why you're seeing some good scores out there. 
 The greens were good this morning, but they're going to get -- because of how soft they are and how wet they are, they're going to get beat up with footprints and all kinds of traffic, but we'll have to deal with that tomorrow.

 Q. I understand you went to the barbecue last night at the Walter Reed Hospital. How was that?
 JIM FURYK: It's a wonderful evening. My wife and I went last year, and it was just good to meet a lot of wonderful people that have gone and risked their lives for our country. Some of them have gone through some very tough experiences, losing limbs, and the hospital is all about getting them back on track. It's amazing, their outlooks and their positive attitudes. 
 It's that old scenario where you think you want to go there and try to cheer some people up, and you leave there just in awe of their attitude and how tough they are, and they end up inspiring you.
