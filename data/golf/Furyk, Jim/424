THE MODERATOR:  Really bunched up out there.  They're not all done yet, but it looks like 11 is going to be the lead.  Bunch of guys at 10.  Bunch of guys at 9.  What's the mindset tomorrow then when it's that cramped on
JIM FURYK:  Well, I need to fire a good number.  You know, like you said, 11 or 12 will be leading, but a bunch of guys the 10, 9, 8, 7.  Someone's going to fire a good number tomorrow.

I don't know what the conditions are supposed to be like.  Kind of want to get home and check the weather report and get an idea for what tomorrow's going to hold.  But if the conditions are like they were today where it's still soft and the wind stays down, someone's going to go out and shoot a good number and one this tournament.

Need to get up tomorrow thinking about playing well.
Q.  3 under today.  Did you leave any out there?
JIM FURYK:  Well, you can always find spots where I could have made a putt here or there.  But I got it up and down and few times and, you know, I scored pretty well today for what I gave myself.

Need to hit some more crisp iron shots tomorrow.  Give myself some more opportunities to hit a better number.

THE MODERATOR:  Thanks, Jim.
