 Q.   Pretty good match out there.   I know you hate to lose it that way.   You played very well.   
JIM FURYK:   I played solid today.   I made a couple of mistakes on the back nine.   I had him in trouble on 12 and then end up losing the hole.   I had the opportunity to win a hole and lost.   
I just pushed it slightly on 14.   
I give him credit, it was great on 16, great up and down.   And then birdies at 17 and eagle on 18.   I tip my hat to him.   It was a good match back and forth, it was just disappointing.
