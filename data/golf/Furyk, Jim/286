 Q. (Inaudible.) 
 JIM FURYK: I didn't make the putt at 14, but we had opportunities to get some distance, and they hung around and they made some tough shots. 

 Q. Did you feel you let them hang around? 
 JIM FURYK: I give them all the credit. They made birdies, and we only birdied the last hole. 
 Going into 16 tee 1-up, I feel like you pretty much have to birdie two of the last three. 

 Q. What do you think about the finish on 17, giving guys a chance to score? 
 JIM FURYK: It's rare that you usually have that coming down the stretch. Usually you have some ball busters coming down the stretch and here you have three of the shortest holes on the golf course, probably three of the five shortest holes.
