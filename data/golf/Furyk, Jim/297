 Q. After that bogey start you played some awfully great golf today. 
 JIM FURYK: Yeah, obviously I hit an awful drive at 1 but ended up driving the ball really well, hit a bunch of fairways today. I had to stay patient on the front because I hit a bunch of good iron shots and didn't make any putts for birdie on the front side. So I birdied No. 9 and got it back to even par, and then it seemed like the holes opened up a little bit and I was able to make some birdies and get a good round going.

 Q. Tell us about that chip-in on 14. 
 JIM FURYK: Yeah, I hit it in the right rough. You never want to hit it over that green. I was in the right rough back there with a hybrid in my hand. I got a heater that got over the green, just trying to chip it, get it somewhere within six, seven feet of the hole and give myself a chance at par, and it happened to curl in. 
 Things have a way of evening out. I had a bunch of putts that wouldn't go in early on in the front nine, and I ended chipping one in from a place that's difficult to get the ball up-and-down.
