 Q. Jim, what did you learn about yourself this week that will help you for next week? 
 JIM FURYK: I think my game is close. I made a lot of stupid errors early on today and wasted a couple -- two or three shots on the front nine and really put myself behind the 8-ball, but I ground it out. Actually at one time I was 4-under par from the 8th tee on, walking up 18, and I made bogey. But my game is close, but I've got to make some adjustments.

 Q. Anything you take from a course like this to a course like that? 
 JIM FURYK: The only similarities I think they have is they're both really difficult. How's that? But next week will test a lot of areas of our game. You have to get the ball in the fairway. Hopefully we don't have a lot of rain and the fairways are firm and fast. It's a tough, tough golf course, and so is this one, so it's good preparation.

 Q. How much do you know about Anthony Kim? Have you ever played with him, and how good a player do you think he is? 
 JIM FURYK: I wouldn't say I know him well, but I've talked to him a lot in the locker room. I think I've played with him once before. He's got a lot of game, actually. He's young. You can tell that he's confident; he really believes in himself. He walks around with a little bit of a swagger and style, and you can tell that he's got a lot of confidence in his game. 
 But everyone you talk to says he can play, and he's whooping the field this week, so my hat's off to him. He's playing great.
