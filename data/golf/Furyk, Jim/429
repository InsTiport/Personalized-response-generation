against him, how amazing is it what he continues to do?
JIM FURYK:  I don't wants to be the first to jinx it    actually that would be you.  I would be the second.

But that being said, you know, no matter how he finishes his career, so far to this point it's been pretty incredible and 11 majors to this point and possibly a 12th coming up, pretty impressive.  I think he reached    a lot of people predicted he would give Nicklaus's record a run, but probably would not have predicted he would get to 12 this soon.
Q.  There's a lot made of that that guys in the same group with him last day of a major don't perform as well.  What makes it tough?
JIM FURYK:  I actually think it's harder to play in front of him.  I'm not particularly fond of playing right in front of him because the stampede of elephants is always running up on your group to get a spot to watch him play.  You have to play through a lot of distraction in the group in front of him.

Obviously he's a tough guy to beat head to head.  It doesn't happen very often.  It seems like no matter what condition his game is in, he finds a way to win and scraps it out.
