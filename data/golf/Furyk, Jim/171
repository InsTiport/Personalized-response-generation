Q.   You're playing Bubba Watson tomorrow.   Talk about what you're expecting. 
JIM FURYK:   My round 2 opponent is Bubba Watson.   Bubba is a very talented player, obviously a lot of power versus me who doesn't, so we have a little bit different styles of game, but he's able to maneuver the ball a lot, hit a lot of creative shots and is very good around the greens.
The one thing I look at is he's had a lot of success on this golf course in the past and played well, and I expect a very, very difficult match, and I'll have to play well to win.

Q.   What do you think the key was today for you to come out on top? 
JIM FURYK:   You know, it was this morning.   We kind of jockeyed back and forth yesterday and we were even when they blew the siren.   The weather was miserable on the 7th tee, and Ryan hit a perfect drive, bombed one down the middle, he was sitting in the garden spot.   I hit an ugly little low hook in the left rough, no chance of getting to the green in two, and then they blew the siren, so I knew that's what would be waiting on me this morning.   My goal was to go out and if I could somehow manage a halve on 7, it would feel like a victory, it would feel like a win.   I hacked it out, knocked a wedge up there from about 106 and knocked it to about four feet and made it for par, and it gave me a boost of confidence.
Ryan hit a couple loose shots for the next four holes, I made a couple birdies and it turned into winning four holes in a row, I won 8, 9, 10 and 11, and the final margin was 3.   So really get being off to a really good start this morning with the halve on 7 and then winning four holes was a big jump for me.
