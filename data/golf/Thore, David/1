 Q.   Talk a bit about the greens.   A lot of guys have commented how they got firmer and firmer throughout the day.    And that along with the pin placements, how was the short game in general for you?  
DAVID THORE:   Well, yeah, like I say, we were the last group in and with the wind it certainly dried them out.   
Like the last hole, I hit, I thought I hit a pretty good shot and it hit pin high and went to the back of the green.   But after three practice rounds I knew what to expect.   
The wind just made it a little bit too tough.   But I thought the pins were fair.   They just, they don't have so many pin placements, it doesn't look like.   There's just the few.  
   
 Q.   Other than the wind, compared to your practice rounds, any surprises?  
DAVID THORE:   No, no, it was pretty much what I expected and it's a good test.   It's supposed to be a championship.   And like I said, if the wind continues, I don't know if the wind is going to keep blowing this hard, but it will be okay if it lays down a little bit, we'll get used to it and it will be better.   
   
 Q.   Anything you would do differently tomorrow?  
DAVID THORE:   I drove the ball beautiful, right in the middle of the fairway.   I made three or four bogeys.   And I made a double bogey on the 8th hole, the hard hole up the hill.   I just hit a shot that went so hard, the wind was blowing, and it actually knocked it down and that was it.
