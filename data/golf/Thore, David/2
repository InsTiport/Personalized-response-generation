 Q. Overall just any comments on your experience here at the Senior PGA Championship?
 DAVID THORE: Yeah, the golf course was very difficult. Which I expected it to be for a Major Championship. And I was told it was fairly hilly, but there's a lot more hills here than I thought. I should probably have done some more leg training, I think. 
 But overall the golf course is very good and I thought they set it up very fair. It's been real windy, and like I couldn't reach some of the par-4s in the practice rounds, but I thought the golf course was set up real well. And like I said, I played with Jay Don who just shot 5-under on that front nine, so it's out there if you're playing well. 

 Q. What are some of the highlights of your week here?
 DAVID THORE: Just seeing a lot of guys that I played the TOUR with -- 25 years ago I played the TOUR in the early '80s -- and then I see them on TV all the time, but it's nice to talk to them, catch up a little bit on the families and things like that. So that's been the biggest highlight, I guess.
