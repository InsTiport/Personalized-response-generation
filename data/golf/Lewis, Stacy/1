  Q. Just start with the front nine.  The last two days 11-under par.
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.
 Q. What is it about the front nine that has you going?
 STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.  I hit a lot of fairways I think is the key, but just hit a lot of really good iron shots and I really didn't miss a golf shot until 14.
 So just hit it really solid and got the putter going late yesterday, so kind of found something there.  But pretty crazy.  I mean, you add those two nines I shoot 61, so pretty sweet.
 Q. How can you use that to your advantage tomorrow to get off to another hot start and hopefully keep the pedal down on the back nine?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think we're going to need another good one.  I do think it's going to play tougher as the day goes on.  The wind is going to pick up.  So hopefully I'm not too far back tomorrow.
 Just the confidence I have on the front nine, I'm playing well.  I thinned a wedge a little bit on 14, but other than that, I really hit the ball great today.
 Playing good, so just need to keep that in my mind and hopefully I can make a run tomorrow.
 Q. Put yourself in a good spot to do that.
 STACY LEWIS:   Uh-huh.
 Q. The rest of the day a Houston day I would imagine.
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.
 Q. Take me through first you have your husband, he was on the bag for one of his players at Houston.  I think they finished at +2 overall.
 STACY LEWIS:   Okay.
 Q. I think +1 is leading.  What was it like, the process for him to be on the bag at Augusta?
 STACY LEWIS:   Well, he's obviously her coach at Houston and she's, I mean, a great player.  It's just a cool experience for her to get to play there, to get to play under those circumstances and learn in that moment.
 So I was going to go see what they finished at.  My mom was watching on her phone today.  But rest of the day we got basketball to watch, and that was the one thing about the early tee time today is I could watch the games.
 So excited about that.  Probably do some swimming in the pool with Chesnee and just hanging out.
 Q. As far as the basketball team, what's it been like to see their run.
 STACY LEWIS:   It's been awesome.  We've got to know Kelvin and he's a fan of mine and so I'm a fan of theirs.  I love the way they play.  So it's been really cool for the city to make that run, and I think they got a chance today, so I'm excited to see it.
 Q. Yeah, go Houston.  Go Cougs.
 STACY LEWIS:   Go Cougs.
