   THE MODERATOR: We're here with Stacy Lewis. Great playing again today. Can you just talk a little bit about your round? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. It was a really hard round. I'm exhausted, as I hit it in the rough all day and just struggling to make pars, and just really glad for the day to be over. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions? 

 Q. Yeah. Particularly I think on the front nine it looked like you -- every hole you hit a four or five, six-footer, but you were making them. So I mean were you getting a certain amount of energy from the fact that you weren't making them or was it just a grind?
 STACY LEWIS: I mean you get some confidence from that, but it's really frustrating to have to make those putts hole after hole, and to be hacking out of the rough, whether it's off the tee on par-5, just trying to lay up. I mean I just made the day really hard on myself, but I was lucky to get away with still shooting under par. 

 Q. Is there pressure in playing with somebody like Yani who seemed to be on the pin every shot she hit?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. It seems like every time I play with her she plays like that. But she's playing great right now, and it's hard because you know that, I mean, she's got a pretty good chance of making birdie almost every hole. So it definitely puts pressure on me, but I felt comfortable there, and she's playing great golf, so I just have to go play some good golf tomorrow, too.

 Q. And did your lead seem to disappear really quickly on that front nine?
 STACY LEWIS: No, not really because I was glad that I just didn't give her the lead. She had to make three birdies and she had to earn the lead, and I actually still had the lead at the turn. So I was glad that she didn't shoot even par and pass me.

 Q. Would you wish you weren't playing with her for a second day in a row and maybe not have to watch everything she does?
 STACY LEWIS: No. I'd much rather play with the leaders and play with somebody who's No. 1 in the world any day. 

 Q. After grinding today will you do any more work on the range? Will you go home? Will you try it tomorrow?
 STACY LEWIS: I think I need to go to the range for a little bit just for myself, and I kind of figured some things out a little bit on the back nine, especially off the tee, so I want to kind of see if I've got that figured out. But not too much. 

 Q. When you're out there grinding like you were today, what do you tell yourself to kind of keep yourself going or how do you deal with that mentally?
 STACY LEWIS: I mean I told my caddie, I was like, let's just keep trying to hit good shots and hopefully we get a good bounce or something like that. 
 I mean on 9 I didn't hit a great shot, but got a really good bounce and made birdie. So you just gotta keep hoping for the good bounce.

 Q. It wasn't as hot today, but it was more humid. You said you like hot and humid. We gave it to you today. Were the course conditions markedly different or still pretty rock hard?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, they were still pretty hard. I think the wind was more of a factor today. It was definitely kind of swirled in the trees. It wasn't consistent all day. 
 Especially on I think it was 17 tee, we had trouble there. I think Yani backed off her shot two or three times. So the wind was just swirling in the trees. I think that made it a little more difficult today. 

 Q. Do you think your ability to stay patient today during a round where you had to really scramble and then get to an under-par round stemmed from your experience where you led the U.S. Open?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. I mean I think that's just me and just the way I play. I mean I know throughout four days you're going to have to have a round where you're going to struggle and you gotta just get the ball in the hole, so I hope today was that day and I'm just going to move on tomorrow. 

 Q. Do you feel like an underdog going into tomorrow?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. I think so. I mean any time you're playing No. 1 in the world, I mean she's No. 1 for a reason and she's playing really good golf. So I think she's got more pressure on her for tomorrow, so I can just go out there and play. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? No? Thank you, Stacy.
