 Q.   Not a surprise I guess but still a good day on the golf course?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's always hard to follow up a day like I had yesterday, especially on the greens.   It was the kind of day that could have been worse and it could have been better.   But, you know, overall, I'm right where I need to be going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   In what ways could it have been better?  
STACY LEWIS:   Definitely I just didn't quite hit shots as close as I would have liked.   Kind of some greens that I thought were going to really stop, the ball would just hit and stop; I had a lot of 15‑ and 20‑footers and just didn't make anything today.  
   
 Q.   A two‑shot lead heading into the final day.   How are you leading?   Some players say they obviously want to be in the lead, but you know deep down that's not quite the truth.   How are you in that respect?  
STACY LEWIS:   I honestly think it depends on the golf course.   I think if you're on a course where you are making a bunch of birdies, you'd almost be chasing, but as hard as this golf course is playing I think you would take every lead you can get.   I like being out there and I like having people chase me.   If I just take care of myself tomorrow, I'll be fine.  
   
 Q.   I guess having the score that you got in round two in the bank, knowing that you can shoot that, must really help?  
STACY LEWIS:   It does.   I know on this golf course if you start hitting some shots close and take care of the par 5s, you can shoot a good score.   
So just got to play a little bit smarter and leave the ball in a little bit better places so I have some better putts at it.   But I mean, overall, game feels good.   
   
 Q.   Do you have any stats for us?   
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know fairways.   I hit 16 greens and had 32 putts.   So that was the difference from yesterday.   
   
 Q.   You were getting the greens worked out yesterday‑‑  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, that's golf, just when you think you've got it figured out, it's something else.   But it was more, just didn't hit it quite as close.   Didn't have as many good opportunities at birdie.   But still hit a ton of greens and if I can just get a couple more putts to fall early tomorrow, then I think I'll be in a good place.   
   
 Q.   Is it difficult when you're in the lead and the other girls are finding it hard to shoot very low scores, is it difficult to like not think about consolidation or like, I'm in the lead here?   What's your mental approach going into tomorrow?   Is it push away or stick with what you've got?   
STACY LEWIS:   I think you've got to take‑‑ this golf course, you just have to take what it gives you.   If you have a shot like on 12 today, I felt really good over that shot.   I feel like I had a good number with it, so I was pretty aggressive with it and made birdie.   It was just something, if you feel like you have a good look at it, you've got to take advantage of it and not play safe.  
.   Certain holes definitely out here, you play safe.   Like 18 for me is a three‑shot hole every day and I think I can make birdie with my wedge.   
So it's just taking what the course gives you, and if I do what I did yesterday and start making some putts, I'll be fine.   
   
 Q.   You really find the 9th very easy.   
STACY LEWIS:   I walked off that hole saying, it took me the hardest hole on the golf course to make a birdie.   I had a similar number as to what I had yesterday as far as the shot in.   I knew what club I needed to hit and the type of shot, and this one came off a little bit better than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised how you've maintained the good form you've been showing over the past couple months?   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, usually you think you slip up here and there, but even when I have not played as well, I've still shot around even par.   So it just shows that my short game has been really good, kind of getting up‑and‑down when I hit bad shots.   It just makes things a lot easier for sure.   
   
 Q.   Are you disappointed that the year is coming to an end for you?  
STACY LEWIS:   I mean, as good as I'm playing, you kind of want to keep going.   But I'm also looking forward to some time off, and just to be in the same place for more than a week will be nice.   But I don't think I'll put the clubs away as long as I have in years past, just because I want to keep going and keep the momentum going.   
   
 Q.   Who would you assess, looking at the leaderboard, who would you assess is the main competition for tomorrow?  
STACY LEWIS:   Pornanong when we played together yesterday, played so solid.   She was hitting fairway woods into holes and I was hitting 8‑irons and she was hitting it inside of me.   She's just kind of sneaky and steady, so I think she's definitely somebody to look out for, and Carlota hits it so far that she can take advantage of the par 5s.   So I would look to those two.
