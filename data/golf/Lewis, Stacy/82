  STACY LEWIS: To have a good day after yesterday where nothing went right was a big deal for me personally. To post a number to give myself a chance at the medal at the end, I think coming into the week, that's all you can ask for.   
   
 Q. Disappointed none of the Americans are on the podium?  
STACY LEWIS: A little bit. But you think, you've got 60 players in the field and only three can be on the podium; it was going to be hard to get there anyway. You've got all the top players in the world here. You're going to have to play some great golf to get up there on the podium.  
It is what it is but we still had a pretty good showing.  
   
 Q. Looking back on it, is it the finish yesterday you're going to kick yourself?   
STACY LEWIS: It was more the round yesterday in general. Things started kind of going sideways and I couldn't stop it. It's just, I don't know what I would have done different to try to slow things down. It was just kind of the way things went yesterday was kind of the story of the finish.   
But I mean, to think that I could come back and still have a putt there to maybe get in the playoff is a pretty big deal.  
   
 Q. What can you say about Inbee? She's done it all.   
STACY LEWIS: It's not surprising. This golf course, especially with the wind, it's set up perfect for her. And the way she putts the ball, especially this week, she made everything she looked at yesterday in the wind, and that was a pretty impressive round of golf.  
   
 Q. Do people outside of the golf world kind of understand what she's doing?   
STACY LEWIS: I don't think people understand at all. If you watch her, or even Lydia, watch both of them play golf, nothing is going to, you're not going to be wowed. You're not going to be amazed. But if you watch it over a period of time, you'll be amazed, and people maybe just don't pay attention that much.   
Coming back from an injury and not playing and not being competitive, that's a hard thing to do. And the way she won this week was very impressive.   
   
 Q. Without knowing the TV ratings and numbers and statistics, in your estimation, obviously talking to others, what do you think these past four days have done for women's golf?   
STACY LEWIS: I think it's been great. I've had more messages and more texts from people that don't really watch golf. My parents have gotten messages from people that they haven't heard from in years, and they are watching golf just because it's part of the Olympics.   
I hope this made a mark for us, and you know, hopefully, we'll be in the Olympics for years to come.   
   
 Q. It was really cool you guys went out and watched them coming up. Would you like to see a team concept at some point?  
STACY LEWIS: I would. I would like to see some sort of twoâ€‘man team. I think you still have an individual medal, but I would like to see a team format. I think it would make things more exciting or more fun. I don't know what the scores would have ended up today, but just kind of more things to pay attention to out there.   
   
 Q. Gerina Piller came from nowhere and was pretty close going into the back nine.   
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I was watching the leaderboard all day and hoping one of us could get on the podium. But Gerina is going to get over this hump pretty soon. She needs the experience of being in these final groups. It's a different pressure and it's a different mentality, especially when you have Inbee that's going crazy. She's got the game and she'll get there soon.
