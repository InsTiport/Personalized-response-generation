 Q.  At what point were thinking, hey, maybe I can take the lead on this thing? 
 STACY LEWIS:  It was everything about the lead, hitting good golf shots. 

 Q.  Is she a good caddie? 
 STACY LEWIS:  It's awesome.  She knows the course as well as I do, so it's helpful.  She's like a friend and we can just hang out and have fun. 

 Q.  I know there's still 36 holes left to play.  Knowing that the last amateur to win a national event was 1969, and here you are 18 holes in with the lead, what does that feel like?  What do you think? 
 STACY LEWIS: It's a cool feeling.  Obviously I've never been here so I need to not really think about the lead and just go play golf.
