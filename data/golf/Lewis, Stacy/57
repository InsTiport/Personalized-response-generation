Q. Was it easy or harder than you thought today?
STACY LEWIS: Way harder.  In Gee played great, and I knew she would.  I knew it was going to be hard.  Was hitting a lot good shots, a lot of good putts, and they just weren't going in.
To make that up and down on 17 and then to hit the shot out of the bunker on 18, it's something you dream about.
Q. You came here with an mission.  (Regarding donating winnings to Hurricane Harvey Relief.)
STACY LEWIS: That's unbelievable.  You know, when I said that I had the goal winning the tournament, and you got to get a lot of things right, to go your way.
Just what we're going to be able to do, we're going to be able to help me rebuild houses and get their homes back.  That's more important than anything.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS: I plan not to play another hole.  I can tell you that.  I'm excited.  I'm excited to get the monkey off my back and just to know I can do it, I can hit the shots when I need to and hit the putts when I need to.
It's nice to see yourself do that again.
