 Q.  So Sei Young tied Annika's record for lowest 72-hole score.  What can you say about that score out here on this course?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, you knew somebody was going to do it.  Just the way this golf course was playing this week, you kind of had to figure somebody was going to go out there and shoot a low score, and it was going to take -- I had 8, 9 10-under in my head.   
 Q.  And what are your thoughts on your round today?  
STACY LEWIS: Not very good.  You know, just got off to a bad start, and putts just didn't go in like they had the last couple of days.  I had a couple hip out.  And hit it solid again.  So was able to kind of scratch out a Top 10 which is always good.
