  STACY LEWIS:   I feel like it's not really that far off with this golf course the way it is.   It just shows it when you hit it a little off.

Q.   How did you feel (inaudible)?
STACY LEWIS:   I mean, it definitely played harder, but I didn't think it was unfair.   If you hit good shots, you were rewarded. 
The wind was certainly a factor, but the greens were still pretty soft from the rain last night.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
STACY LEWIS:   I mean, it's really just missing the shot in the right place.   You know, No. 1, I missed it over the back.   Missed it over the back at 9, hit it in fairway bunker.   So I mean, I miss it in places where you are not going to get up‑and‑down.   That's the big thing is you can't hit it in those places. 
A couple of those were just good shots that went too far, so I don't really know what to do there.   I've got to make more putts.   I've had a lot of putts the last few days. 

Q.   After two competitive rounds here, do you feel like you can make up some ground over the weekend? 
STACY LEWIS:   I mean, it's hard to say. 
Inbee, she's played so good the last two days that she is going to be tough to catch if you are not already under par.   I mean, I'm going to come out and try to get back under par for the week and see what I can do.

Q.   She putts like that a lot, but it just seems like that confidence‑‑ playing with her for a couple of rounds, it's pretty amazing to watch?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, it's frustrating because she is not exactly knocking the flags down.   She is making putts off the edge of the green, ones that you wouldn't expect her to make.   It's definitely frustrating for us watching.
