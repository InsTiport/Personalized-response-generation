 Q.   Evian coming up, how excited are you to go back to France?  
STACY LEWIS:   I'm real excited.   I've played well there the last few years.   
I mean, coming off of this where my game is right where it needs to be, I'm excited.   I just need to see a few more putts go in, so that's probably all I'll do this off week.  
   
 Q.   It's a major this year; does that give you any added motivation to play well?  
STACY LEWIS:   There's always a little motivation there, I think, no matter what tournament it is.   That tournament has always felt like a major anyway.   
I mean, purseâ€‘wise you've always wanted to win it.   And now it's a major and you just want to win it more.
