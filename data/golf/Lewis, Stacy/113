Q. 4-under, you must be happy with that?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it was a bit up-and-down.  Definitely any time you shoot under par on this golf course is a good score.  But really, left a lot out there today, a couple 3-putts and just not taking advantage of 18 again, which I haven't done all week.  It's a little bit of a disappointment.
Q. What will your routine be like today?  Will you go back to the putting green and work on that?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I'll work a little bit with some tee shots and also the putting.  I hit my irons a lot better today, which I've been working on my swing here for the last two weeks.  So it's nice to finally see some fats going online and just got to clean the card up a little bit.  I think a low one is out there.  I'm going to need it tomorrow.
