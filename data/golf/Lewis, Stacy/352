   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You held a one-shot lead after what was officially the first round of what was supposed to be a 54-hole event.  Can you talk about what coming out here and playing on your home course means to you?   
 STACY LEWIS:  Well, obviously I played really well.  I mean, I'm disappointed that we didn't get to finish, but we played so well, it's hard to really be upset.   
 And yesterday was just a roller coaster of emotions going from playing my best competitive round ever, and then to kind of feel like a knife in your heart; you don't get a chance to win.  But it was a great week, it was a great experience, and I'll never take it away.  I'll always have it.   
  
  Q.  Did it feel like a win, or just one good round?   
 STACY LEWIS:  That's all it is.  It's not an official win or anything.  It's one good round of golf, and that's all really you can take from it.   
  
  Q.  Is it hard seeing the weather out there today?   
 STACY LEWIS:  It's hard to say whether we would have been able to play or not.  Obviously it's not the players' call.  It's not anybody else's call except for the LPGA and the officials.  I mean, we wish we could have played.  I would have played till Tuesday if we had to, but it's not my choice.   
  
  Q.  Have you heard any reaction from the players?   
 STACY LEWIS:  I know they were pretty upset about it.   
  
  Q.  No, about what you shot.   
 STACY LEWIS:  About what I shot?  Oh, yeah, everybody's told me "congratulations" and "good job" and things like that.   
  
  Q.  Like "you're going to be out here one day?"   
 STACY LEWIS:  Yeah, they know from the Craft and everything, they have seen me play well and they have seen me play.  A lot of the caddies have told me parents that I'm going to be out here and I'll be successful.  So that's good to hear.   
  
  Q.  Had this been an official win, do you know if you would have gotten an exemption on Tour?   
 STACY LEWIS:  Yeah, I've been offered an exemption for next year.   
  
  Q.  For the whole year on Tour?   
 STACY LEWIS:  Yeah, for '08, for the whole year.   
 I guess I could have finished school and then come out and played, we don't really know.  I don't really know how it all works.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it casts a bad light on the tournament?   
 STACY LEWIS:  Yeah, the players have been out playing for the longest -- it's just it's weather and it happens.  I've heard great things about the course.  Everybody has told me how much they like the course and love the area.  I hope we'll be back next year.  I know the players really like it here.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What kind of motivation does it give you, entering some of your first collegiate tournament in your senior year here, what do you take away from this?   
 STACY LEWIS:  Probably just more confidence that I can play with the best players in the world, and I can beat 143 of the best players in the world on one day.  It's just confidence going into the college season and I can't wait to get started.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Stacy, congratulations on a great round out there.
