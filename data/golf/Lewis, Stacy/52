 Q.  Two rounds down, how are you feeling?  
STACY LEWIS: Pretty good.  I wish I would have played better today, but all in all, I feel pretty good and excited to have two more days.   
 Q.  Obviously it's always good to look forward to the weekend.  
STACY LEWIS: Right.  I mean, that golf course got pretty hard out there, I thought, pretty firm.  It was hard to get it close to the hole, hard to make putts.  Glad I played well yesterday just to make today a little bit easier.  I'll just try to play better tomorrow.   
 Q.  What's your mindset going into tomorrow?  
STACY LEWIS: You know, just try to do the best I can.  I felt like I hit a lot of good putts today, and they just didn't go in.  If I can just get a couple more putts to fall tomorrow, I think a low number is out there.  Nobody is running away with this thing.   
 Q.  Seems like the greens keep firming up in the afternoon, so you kind of expect the same thing going into tomorrow?  
STACY LEWIS: I would think so.  They're very crusty this afternoon.  I think crusty is a very good term.  You fix pitch marks, and there's not a whole lot of water left in these things.  I'll be off a little earlier tomorrow, which will be nice, and we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  Do you like that quick turnaround --  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  You kind of have control but not really.  
STACY LEWIS: We don't have much of a choice, but I don't know, I just think with today being frustrating, glad I get to get out there tomorrow and do it again.
