 Q.  You ended on a high note today.  How was it to have a solid, 5-under par round?  
STACY LEWIS: I played much better today, which is kind of what I've been looking for all week.  Actually, I think I missed five or six putts inside of six or seven feet.  So still a little bit frustrating, but nice to post a good number.  It was definitely an easier day than I've had the last three.   
 Q.  What's it like stepping off for what could be obviously the last time for a while?  
STACY LEWIS: I honestly haven't even thought about it.  I've been such into the rhythm of playing.  It will be a little bit strange, but I'm looking forward to it.  I'm looking forward to having a little bit of a break and just kind of rest a little bit.   
 Q.  Talk about the support you've had the last four days.  You just heard the crowd go crazy there at the end for you.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I wish that putt would have gone in.  They still might have been cheering.  But most of it was my family, and it's just cool the way they continue to follow me regardless of how I'm playing or whatever it is.  They were cheering for me the whole way.  Just, it's a fun week for all of us.   
 Q.  What are you doing between now and November when you have a new baby girl?  
STACY LEWIS: I'll actually be pretty busy the next couple of months.  I have a few golf and sponsor things to do, seeing family and travel with my husband a little bit.  So not going to really be home until October when I'm forced to be home.  So I don't know what I'm going to do to be home for a month.   
 Q.  How enjoyable was that to have your husband on the bag this week?  
STACY LEWIS: It was a lot of fun.  He got to see the other side of it.  He definitely got a little frustrated with me out there, and I thought it was good for him to learn a little bit to help his kids when he gets home too.   
 Q.  Saw you having a nice chat with Bianca at the end there.  What was it like playing with her?  You're so much of a proponent of the four years of college.  
STACY LEWIS: Right, she's going to be a senior next year, and she just plays really solid.  I just told her that if she could learn to -- all these girls hit it so far, and just learn to manage it a little better and hit more fairways and hit more greens where she can get into a rhythm, I think she could be a really good player.   
It's always fun to play with the college kids.  They love it.  It's fun to see kind of what's coming up.   
 Q.  I would think that's something that makes this tournament even more special for you is everything they do for the NCAAs.  
STACY LEWIS: Right, I loved -- even, say, 10, 12 years ago, Judd was all about getting young amateurs in here and getting them this experience.  It certainly helped me a lot.  I like now it's brought some attention to it with the NCAA Championships, so we're getting the best of the best, which is pretty cool.   
 Q.  On the other end, what are your thoughts on the Senior Women's Open going on right now?  
STACY LEWIS: It's been fun to watch.  Seeing those girls play.   
You know, Juli and Laura they just seem to be playing a different golf course than the rest of the girls.  But it's cool to see them.  They're playing for a great purse, which I think is the best part.  Hopefully they get more coverage as we go.  I would have liked to have seen the first two rounds, especially seeing JoAnne Carner hit that first tee shot and see some of the ladies that maybe didn't make the cut.  Just the legends of the game that I never got to play with, and I think the world needs to see them again.   
 Q.  You were able to string two birdies on 2, 3, and then 13, 14, what was that like, to end your tournament on that kind of round?  
STACY LEWIS: It was nice.  It definitely makes walking away a lot easier.  Just posting a good number finally this week.  Just hitting it better.  I haven't hit it that good all week.  Seeing putts go in, and giving the fans something to cheer about.  Surprised to reach a par-5 in two, I haven't done that with this belly in a while, so I was pretty happy with that.   
 Q.  Pretty hot and humid today.  Did it bother you at all?  
STACY LEWIS: No, it wasn't bad.  This is a cool, summer day in Texas, so I was all good with the heat.   
 Q.  What is first on the agenda going on break?  
STACY LEWIS: I'm going out to Pebble with my husband.  He's recruiting the junior girls.  Actually, I have a marathon day tomorrow, so it's still not quite a break yet.  I've got one more day of work tomorrow.   
 Q.  Is the nursery all ready?  
STACY LEWIS: No, I haven't been home.  I think I've been home a week and a half in the last three months.  So I've ordered things.  So it's going to be like a baby shower when I get home.   
 Q.  What are some general thoughts just now that you're ready to go on to the next stage?  
STACY LEWIS: I mean, I'm excited.  I'm excited about what's to come.  I don't think it's quite hit yet.  I've been in this rhythm of playing.  I just don't think it's quite hit home yet.
