Q.   Is it fair to say another day where you hit well and played well but it didn't quite come off? 
STACY LEWIS:   Today was another frustrating day.   Today was probably the most scorable day we had all week.   Hit the ball great and gave myself a lot of chances.   I didn't make anything on the greens.   Chipped a little better but just didn't make any putts.

Q.   How do you sum up your position after three rounds considering all of that? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think that's where I've gotten over the last few years is that I can maybe struggle a few days and still hang in there and still give myself a chance to win.   That's what I did today.   I went out and at least made a few birdies there coming in to give myself a chance to win tomorrow.   That's the goal every week. 
So we'll just see what happens with the weather.   I think it's going to be a pretty tough day and just got to hang in there. 

Q.   Expecting a bit of weather tomorrow; hanging in there could pay dividends because anything could happen?
STACY LEWIS:   Oh, yeah, you can make a double so quick on this golf course that you've just got to keep hanging in there.   If you get in trouble, get out, and just stay patient.   If you make a bogey, it's okay, because you've got some par 5 finishing holes here.
So it's going to be one much those tough days and just hang in there.   But I like coming from behind versus having the lead.   I think the lead's harder when those conditions get hard.

Q.   So going into tomorrow, is it hopeful or confident?
STACY LEWIS:   I'm hopeful.   I would have liked to have been a couple more under par.   But you know, you can't make 'em all.
