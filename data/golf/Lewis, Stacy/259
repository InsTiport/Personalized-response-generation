 Q.   I'd like to welcome in Stacy Lewis, 5‑under, 67 today.   Fantastic round, no bogeys.   Talk about your round and how it went.   
STACY LEWIS:   It was really pretty easy.   I hit the ball great all day and kind of hit some shaky shots toward the end, but made some nice pars.   I don't know, it's about as easy of a 67 as you can get.  
   
 Q.   Talk about you missed only two fairways.   Talk about being accurate off the tees.   Everyone keeps saying tree‑lined, narrow fairways.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, today with it wet out there, I think it was especially important to hit the fairways to‑‑ we were playing the ball up in the fairways.   So if you got in the fairways, you could at least give yourself a good lie.   You didn't have to worry about that.   The key today was really hitting the fairways.   The greens are so soft, you are just playing target golf.   I love it.   Wherever that ball lands, that is how far it's playing.   That's my kind of golf.   
I mean, had a couple putts lip out on me.   Hit the flag at one point and it spun back off the green.   Had a couple of things not go my way, but I would definitely take this round.  
   
 Q.   Soft conditions.   Like you said, you are an aggressive player going at pins.   Hopefully we dont' get anymore rain delays, but to do you prefer soft conditions where it would allow you to really go at it?  
STACY LEWIS:   You don't want it too soft because it brings in all the low scores you are seeing today.   I think it's so soft out there, I think you are going to see a bunch of low numbers.   You'd almost want it a little bit firmer just so it plays a little tougher, but at the same time it's nice to be making birdies.   
Either way you just have to adjust to it.   The course is going to change throughout the week and you should just keep adjusting to it.  
   
 Q.   I have to ask, your KPMG family is out here.   Team Stacy.   They had a local group from KPMG to come out and follow you.   It's the second time.   They had a group out at Sebonack.   Talk about the partnership that's evolved with them.   They are on Twitter and they kind of took it to the next level.   Talk about how that has evolved and how awesome it is that they support you in every way?  
STACY LEWIS:   It's been about a year and a half since I have been working with them.   They are at the forefront of everything.   I do events for them and it's first class.   They do everything right.   
It's just so cool to have‑‑ those people could be working and making money today and instead they are out here supporting and cheering me on.   It's just really cool to have a team like that.   They do it for Phil as well.   They did it at the Barclays for him.   It's something they've really gotten into.   The employees, they love it; they feel a part of what's going on out there.   
At the U.S. Open, Suzann asked if I had a football team with me.   It's just fun having people following you around, people cheering for you, especially early in the morning.   It can be kind of quiet out there.  
   
 Q.   They started getting louder as the day progressed?  
STACY LEWIS:   It was a little early for everybody and they weren't quite sure.   A lot of people had never been to a golf tournament before.   I think it's a first experience for them and hopefully we have fans, get fans that continue to come out.  
   
 Q.   The whole withdraw thing, how did it feel this morning?   
STACY LEWIS:   I felt great.   I felt like a different person out there from last week.   Just being focused and I knew what my game plan was.   I felt great out there.   Doing what I did last week, other than maybe not starting the tournament and just not even playing at all, but passed that I think I did the right thing.  
   
 Q.   When you come in and it's sort of rainy, do you change how you approach the day?   
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I knew coming into the day, we got some rain overnight.   Obviously coming to the course it was raining when I got here.   Your mindset is different.   You are attacking pins.   You have got‑‑ I spun back some 8 and 9‑irons today.   The longer irons you can be more aggressive with.   I think I made two or three of my birdies with 5 and 6‑irons because you can be more aggressive there.   
I don't know, I think you saw scores early.   I mean, people were 3‑ and 4‑under through four holes.   You had to go out there early and make some birdies.   I hung in there and posted a good number.
