Q.   Well, nice round out there, I know we had talked earlier in the week about how tricky this golf course was, but what were the keys for you to be able to shoot low out there?
STACY LEWIS:   You know, I hit my irons good and just gave myself a lot of birdie putts.   I gave a few shots away off the tee, just which you kind of expect yourself to do.
Seeing Aza go out and shoot 7‑under made me realise you could make some birdies and shoot a low number.

Q.   We saw you last week get off to a hot start, too.   How are you feeling just about your game overall so far? 
STACY LEWIS:   I feel good.   My putter just kind of went cold on me on the weekend, and other than, that I really played fine.   So I'm not really worried about it.   I knew I was swinging at it good and just tried to stay patient and keep playing. 

Q.   When you did see Aza's low number and we talked about how tricky this course might be or how tough it might be so score, were you surprised to know that somebody could go that low out here?
STACY LEWIS:   I was very surprised.   I thought maybe she had started on the back nine, because the back nine I think you can definitely score a little bit more on. 
So for her to start off on the front, and she got off to a hot start‑‑ I was definitely surprised to see that number.   I don't see somebody doing that every single day, so you just hang in there, hang in there, and hopefully you're there on Sunday.

Q.   When you tee off tomorrow, any changes you want to make to your approach on this golf course?
STACY LEWIS:   No, we played it pretty smart.   I had to hit a lot of 5‑ and 6‑irons into the greens, but I'd rather do that than hit out of bunkers.   We played really smart and tried not to second guess ourselves and we did pretty good at it.
