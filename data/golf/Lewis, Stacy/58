 Q.  Given that you opened up with a 71, are you pretty happy with the position you're in right now?  
STACY LEWIS: I am.  It's nice to see your name on a leaderboard.  Didn't get off to the best of starts this week but I played really solid the past two days.  Hopefully there's a low one out there tomorrow.   
 Q.  Speaking about low ones, what do you think you need to shoot or what's your goal tomorrow and what do you need to maybe take the victory?  
STACY LEWIS: Probably something a little better than the last two.  I think people are making a lot of birdies on this golf course.  It's pretty soft, but I think a low one is out there.  I feel like I've left some out there the last two days.
