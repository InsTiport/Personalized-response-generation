Q.   Tell us how it went. 
STACY LEWIS:   It was pretty good.   The ball‑striking wasn't exactly where I wanted it, so to shoot 3‑under on this golf course is pretty good.   It was nice getting out early, getting the better greens than the afternoon wave for sure.

Q.   What do you like or don't like about this course?
STACY LEWIS:   You know, I like this year the greens are a little bit softer and you can be a little bit more aggressive into holes.   It's just a little bit quirky, and especially late in the days, the greens, just the type of grass they are, they get a little tough to putt.   That's really the only down side.   But this year it's definitely in much better shape and allowing us to hit some more shots.

Q.   You said the greens are softer but people have been saying a little quicker, too.   Is that a paradox, or is it just‑‑
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, that's usually how it kind of works out.   They're not really softer, they're just more predictable.   I think in years past we'd get some crazy bounces, but we're coming to this golf course more years, they're learning how to maintain the golf course a little bit better, and that's what happens in the third year of an event.

Q.   By the same token, are you guys learning to play it, too?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.

Q.   Is it much of a strategic course, and where is the strategy on this golf course?
STACY LEWIS:   I think the strategy really is off the tee.   You've got to keep it in play off the tee, and then I like it now.   I like now that you get rewarded for a good shot.   I think in years past you'd hit some good shots and maybe not gotten rewarded and then you get defensive and then you see some bad golf out there.   I think it just sets up for some better golf and more fun for the fans.
