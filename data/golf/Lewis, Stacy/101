 Q.  What differences did you notice in the course over the first two days compared to today?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, the course has played completely different every time I've played it.  The first day I played in the morning it was pretty soft, pretty gettable.   
And then yesterday afternoon I'd say it was almost unplayable at times.   
And today it was somewhere in the middle.  Getting to go out early and having an early tee time was definitely to my advantage.   
 Q.  What are your expectations going into tomorrow?  How are you going to play the final round?  
STACY LEWIS: It just depends on what the golf course gives you.  You just don't know with the conditions how soft the greens are going to be or anything.  So you just have to take what the golf course gives you.  And I like being under par.  I think that will be a good spot going into tomorrow.  And hopefully can chase down the leaders.   
 Q.  Between you and the lead, besides Lydia Ko, there's not a whole lot of experience, former No. 1 player in the world, you have a lot of wins, are you going to take that into tomorrow?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think you have to learn how to play the U.S. Open.  You have to learn how to hang in there and you just give yourself a chance on Sunday.  I've done that this week.  I haven't played my best golf but I've hung around.  This golf course you can make a double pretty quick with one golf swing.  So I'm just going to keep hanging around and see what happens.
