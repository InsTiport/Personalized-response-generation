Q. How would you grade your round on Saturday?
STACY LEWIS: A little bit of a mess today.  Just a few too many mistakes.  Made the birdies I needed to and hit some good putts there coming in.  But I needed a low one.  I knew those girls behind me were going to make some birdies.  Just go out there tomorrow and see what happens.
Q. Told me yesterday you were exhausted.  This was your sixth consecutive week. What are you doing to push through one more day on a major championship Sunday?
STACY LEWIS: Doing nothing but sleeping and play golf.  There hasn't been too many activity this is week.  I'm just trying to get through the week.  I felt good on the golf course.  I feel like I've been getting enough rest.  The game is close and it's coming around.
Q. It's been two years since your last victory and very close and some runner-up performances; do you think this could be the time to get this next win?
STACY LEWIS: It's going to need a crazy number tomorrow but hopefully it is.  If it's not this week, it's coming.  The game is on the right track, and when my wins have come in the past, usually there's a lot of Top-10s that precede it.  I just need to keep playing good golf.
