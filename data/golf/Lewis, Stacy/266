Q.   This is part one of a very, very long day.   Tell us about your day so far, first of all, what time did you get up? 
STACY LEWIS:   I was up at 4.30, so it was still dark out when I woke up, which is hard to do over here.   You knew it was going to be a long day, and I just paced myself out there and did a good job out there and feel pretty good about the round.

Q.   69, put yourself right in touch in this championship, just a couple slips on the homeward stretch, but overall, how do you view your position going into round four now?
STACY LEWIS:   Overall, it was very good.   I think I shot even par on the back nine, which is great score, and you know, 17 is basically playing as a par 5 today, so I don't feel like those two bogeys are going to hurt me too much at the end of the day.
Really the key is going to be getting out to a good start this afternoon but I have a couple of hours to rest up and I'll be ready to go.

Q.   It's about as intense as it gets in the final day of major having to play two rounds; what do you need most of to get through these rounds in good shape? 
STACY LEWIS:   I really hit the ball well this morning and stayed patient on the greens.   I had a bunch of opportunities and if you can just get a couple putts to fall here and there, you're right where you need to be. 
So this is I think the third time we have done 36 holes in the last five Majors, so I think we are all kind of used to it and you've just got to grind it out.

Q.   In all seriousness, fitness must come into play towards the end of this fourth round?
STACY LEWIS:   You would think.   So the golf course, depending on the wind, could get hard; it's stamina, staying patient, being in shape, so hopefully I can use that to my advantage.
