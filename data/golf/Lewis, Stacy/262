 Q.   A roller coaster day for you.   What an incredible up‑and‑down after all you went through today.   How did you find the energy to stay positive out there?  
STACY LEWIS:   I looked at that board and saw those red flags, and I had to get a half a point.   I couldn't let a blue one go up.   
But, I don't know how I got that up‑and‑down.   Paula was pretty amazed there.   But I had to get that half a point.   We both played great all day and we both deserved a halve.  
   
 Q.   You both did play great, but on the greens it was a story of missed opportunities.   Yet, you had to still stay, I guess, positive.   You had to stay optimistic.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I was hitting good putts, they were just lipping out.   That's just golf for you.   You have to stay patient, stay positive.   I hit a lot of really good shots.   And I feel fortunate to get the halve.  
   
 Q.   What will you do now?  
STACY LEWIS:   I got to get out there and cheer on my teammates.   
   
 Q.   Being the first out, when Meg told you that, how did you feel?  
STACY LEWIS:   I was excited.   We, Paula and I, talked about it.   We wanted to go 1, 2 and we wanted to get us off to a good start.   I like this position, I like having the cameras and the eyes on me, I want to be here.   So I was just glad to put some points on the board.  
   
 Q.   If there was something you could change today, some shot you could take back, what would it be?  
STACY LEWIS:   Maybe some of those putts, but a lot of the putts, I hit exactly where I wanted to.   So I had at least three lipouts today, but that's golf and you just keep grinding away.
