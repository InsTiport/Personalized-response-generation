 Q.  Two shots back heading into tomorrow.  Anything can happen out here.  I know it was a frustrating day.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it was frustrating.  I left a lot out there.  It was playing hard but I played well.  Just didn't quite do the little things right, so it's a little frustrating.  But only a couple back, which is good.  I think the weather is going to be even worse tomorrow, so it's really more of a mental test than anything.   
 Q.  Is that definitely what your mind-set is going to tomorrow, patience?  
STACY LEWIS: It's not even really patience.  It's accepting what the golf course gives you.  It's hard to describe even how hard it is.  I mean, it's probably some of the hardest conditions I've ever played in with the wind and this golf course.   
 Q.  Anything putting-wise?  I know you said some putts were left out.  
STACY LEWIS: No, it's hard to make putts.  You're playing the wind; you're playing the grain; you're playing the great; you're trying to keep your body still.  There's a lot of factors that go into making putts.  So when you make them, it's good.  But it's just hard to make them.
