 Q. Good start. 
 STACY LEWIS: Thank you.

 Q. How did it go?
 STACY LEWIS: It was good. I hit a lot of good shots, left it on the right side of the holes. I told my caddie kind of halfway through the round, I said, We need to make one putt you probably shouldn't make and then hit a couple close, and we'll be in good shape. 

 Q. You've got such a sort turnaround between the first and second rounds. What do you do during this time, and how do you get yourself prepared to play 18 more?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, just grab something to eat real quick, inhale some food, and then you've just got to get back into what you're doing, get warmed up, and be ready to go.

 Q. Do you have to be mindfully during the first 18 that you're going to have to play 18 more?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, it's in the back of your mind when you're walking up those hills at the end. Everybody's gotta do it, so you just gotta go out and do it.

 Q. How hilly is this course to walk?
 STACY LEWIS: It's very hilly, and the altitude just doesn't help. It's easier for us than the caddies; I feel bad for the caddies.

 Q. Our know how heavy your bag is?
 STACY LEWIS: Oh, those things are probably 40, 50 pounds easy. 

 Q. You said you birdied 1, 2, 6, 9. Any of those holes in particular stick out?
 STACY LEWIS: Probably 1 and 2, because I bogeyed 18 and then made probably about a 50-footer on the first hole. 
 Then made probably a 15-footer down the hill on 2. So that just kind of got me back into what I was doing, and kind of cruised in from there.

 Q. Did you execute the game plan you wanted? Did you hit one that you probably wouldn't have hit with the long putt? Did you do kind of exactly what you wanted to do?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, for the most part I did everything I want to do. Probably would go back -- if I could hit 3-wood on 18, I would probably do that.
 Other than that, it was a good day. 

 Q. How does it feel being on top right now?
 STACY LEWIS: It's good. I actually haven't really looked at scores at all so I didn't really know where I stood. Kind of stole one on the last hole. 
 I mean, I love where I am. Anything under par at a U.S. Open is a good spot.
