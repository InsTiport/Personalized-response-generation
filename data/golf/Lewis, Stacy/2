  Q. Stacy, 7-under 65.  That has to be a nice way to finish the Kia Classic.
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's definitely the best round of golf I've ever played here.  Just been working on my putter all week and finally found something today that clicked and hit the ball great, so it was a great combination.
 Q. I would imagine when you get putter rolling out here, especially on these challenging greens, that obviously makes a big difference.
 STACY LEWIS:   It does.  I think more than anything my speed was really good.  I had a couple long putts that almost made them, so just went up and tapped them in.
 So speed was really good.  It just frees you up to try to hit it closer.  Obviously setup, having the reachable holes, and was able to take more advantage today than yesterday.
 Q. You had a string of four in a row from nine through 12 and then ended with three ib a row.
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.
 Q. What was in the mind over those streaks?
 STACY LEWIS:   Well, I didn't realize the middle of the round.  I thought it was three in a row.  Kind of forgot about 9 not realizing it was four.
 I think the end was probably more important.  Made a pretty easy birdie on 16.
 About a 15-footer or 17.
 Then about a 25, 30-footer there on 18.
 So just really cool way to finish, and just to have some momentum and starting to see the ball go in the hole, obviously just really excited for next week.
 Q. Yeah, take us through that.  Never missed a cut at the ANA.
 STACY LEWIS:   Uh-huh.
 Q. Coming off Top 5 last fall.
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.
 Q. I know we talked last year, the grasses were a little different, played a little different.  Just how excited are you to get back coming off your performance?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, I love it.  I love this drive over.  It's like my favorite time year just knowing we're going to Palm Springs.  Honestly, probably one of my favorite golf courses we get to play all year and be in the desert where it's hot and the ball is bouncing and it plays hard.
 I hope it's playing firm kind of like it was here, and I think we'll a pretty great leaderboard at the end of the week.
 Q. Is there anything different about momentum at this stage in your career compared to earlier?
 STACY LEWIS:   Maybe a little, but I think as you get older you just kind of realize you just got to keep working on stuff, and you just keep working on it and I never know when one thing is going to kind of click like it did today.
 And I don't know, I think you worry about things too much when you're younger, and as you get older it's like, just keep working on it, just keep working on it, and it kind of slowly gets better, and hopefully it peaks at the right time.
 Q. Last one for you.  How nice of a week was it to have Kia back on the schedule and be back at Aviara?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it was unbelievable.  It was weird to think that we didn't come last year.  I love being in San Diego.  I have family out here, so just a fun week for me.  And love the weather this year, the weather was perfect this year, so made it even better.
 Q. Yeah, turned right around for the weekend.
 STACY LEWIS:   That's right.  That's right.
