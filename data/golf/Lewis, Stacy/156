 Q.  Well, these things keep happening?  STACY LEWIS: I guess the more times you do it, the easier it gets.  I don't know.  That's all you can do.  You can't sit and dwell on it.  You just have to go out the next week and try to win.  I'm doing a lot of really good things, so I just have to keep going forward.   Q.  Congratulations on a great week and go get them next time.  STACY LEWIS: Thank you.
