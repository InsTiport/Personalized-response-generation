Q. Stacy Lewis coming back from maternity leave.  How special is this event and being back in competitive mode after having your daughter Chesnee?
STACY LEWIS: It's been awesome, just knowing that when I leave here today, I get to go pick her up.  It just changes your whole world.  Golf doesn't really matter anymore.  Just pleasantly surprised with the round.  I wasn't quite expecting it.  But always going to take a good score.
Q. What has been the balancing act so far to get in practice and preparation for the season opener?
STACY LEWIS: It's been difficult.  Fortunately, I have great family members and great friends who have helped watch Chesnee so I can get some practice in.  It's a juggling act.  You don't get a lot of sleep, and it's hard to stay out there and practice too long, but maybe in the end it's a good thing.
Q. She'll be your good luck charm?
STACY LEWIS: That's right.
Q. Finally, being in this tournament, very unique start to the year.  The AT&T box had the loud music and fans surrounding you.  What's kind of the vibe?
STACY LEWIS: It's fun.  Walking off that 1st tee, it didn't necessarily feel like a normal golf tournament, but it was fun.  Playing with the guys, and it was just more relaxed.  It's just a great way to start the year.  If you have this at the end of the year, it's probably kind of a drag, but to start the year this way is a lot of fun.
Q. Congratulations on a great first start.
STACY LEWIS: Thank you.
