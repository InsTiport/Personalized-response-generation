Q. Has to be a nice way to start?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think I've improved my first round scoring average.  A little bit frustrating because I left some out there, but like I said, I think that's the best first round I've had all year.  So first round's kind of been my thing and to get off to a good start is a really good thing.
Q. Why do you think that's been?
STACY LEWIS: You get in trends sometimes where sometimes you get off -- you get on a streak where you get off to fast starts and sometimes you get off to slow starts and maybe a round like this will break the trend a little bit.
Q. How key is it in a 54-hole tournament to get off to a good start?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, that's why I think I've won here the last -- once or twice, because I've gotten off to good starts with both of them.  It's a shootout.  Especially as soft as the greens are and the course this year, there's a bunch of low scores, and it's going to be a shootout at the end of the week.
Q. I know you are one to say you play well when others are playing well in your group; you guys all had pretty low scores.  How much did that come into play today?
STACY LEWIS: It definitely did.  We had a bunch of holes where we all made birdies.  Anna I think is the only one that got off to a slow start, but then she just made everything the last 12 holes or so.  She made nine birdies in 12 holes or something.  It's cool and fun to watch.  Especially on these greens, it's nice to see other people making puts because then you feel like you can make some, too.
Q. What was key today?
STACY LEWIS: I hit a bunch of greens.  Hit the irons really good.  Missed some drives on some of the shorter holes where you want to be in the fairways and having some birdie opportunities, but hit the irons really good.
