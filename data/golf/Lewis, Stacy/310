 Q.   Tell me what the difference was.  
STACY LEWIS:   You know, I actually didn't play that bad yesterday.   I just kind of let a few things get to me.   My attitude was not very good, and I came out today, I didn't really have anything to lose, and I knew I was playing well.   So just a little better attitude.  
   
 Q.   Is there a little bit feeling of pressure of maybe trying to get a few birdies early, just make sure you get yourself under par for the day and get sort of building toward I gotta make the cut if I want to win; right?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I knew I needed to shoot a couple under just to make the cut, but I kind of looked at it as chipping away at the lead, so that makes me not focus on the cut.   That's what I did.   If I can get to under par tomorrow, I think I'll be in a good spot.   I'm happy I came back and played better today.  
   
 Q.   How big was the birdie at 2 after bogey one?  
STACY LEWIS:   Oh, it was huge.   I hit a bad second shot, bad chip shot that putt and I was like here we go again.   And birdie at 2, bounced back right away, made a really good putt, and that really kind of calmed me down, and from there I didn't really hit a bad shot from there in.  
   
 Q.   How far was the putt?  
STACY LEWIS:   About eight feet.  
   
 Q.   The kind you need to make?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean a par 5 you hit a wedge in there pretty close, you have to make it, here at a U. S. Open you have to make it.  
   
 Q.   Did you work on anything yesterday or do anything after your round?   I know it was so late in the day?  
STACY LEWIS:   Honestly I got done with the round and I told my coach, I said I don't know what I would work on.   I made a couple ‑‑ one bad swing on 6, and really, shooting a couple over is not really a bad score out there.   So I didn't really know what I needed to work on, so I didn't really do anything.   We also finished at 8:00.   So less than 12 hours to my tee time.  
   
 Q.   In some ways is that not better because then you're not stewing on it, too?  
STACY LEWIS:   Absolutely.   I was glad I didn't play in the morning, and I had all day yesterday to think about it and then this morning to think about it, so it was good that I was able to get into a rhythm early this morning.
