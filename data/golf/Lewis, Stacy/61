Q. What's been the reaction that you've gotten?
STACY LEWIS: Obviously been really positive.  A lot of messages and texts and people wanting to know how they can help.
That's kind of the point behind it, is to get more people involved and create some awareness about it.
Q. Was this ever something that's crossed your mind before or was this just so close to home that you felt really compelled?
STACY LEWIS: I just saw different people doing things with birdies and all that.  I just, I don't know, wanted to do something that was going to make a difference.  Just said, why not?
But, you know, there are so many bad things going on there.  It's not just about this week.  It's going to be going on for a long time.  The more help we can get down there the better.
Q. What's been the reaction from fellow players, especially about you trying to get people to donate shoes?
STACY LEWIS: Just everybody said it's really cool what you're doing.  It's just really cool that you're taking the time to do it and putting it out there.  There are not a lot of people that would do that.
Q. Have you gotten in any shoes yet?
STACY LEWIS: No, just put it out there last night.  Maybe get some today.  I would love to have too many shoes to send home.
