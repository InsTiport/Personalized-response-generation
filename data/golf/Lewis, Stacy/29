Q. Stacy, I know you left here when you were just two years old, but every time you open your passport this is going to be home.  Do you enjoy the support playing here year after year?
STACY LEWIS: I do.  I love it.  You know, it was pressure at first, but now it's fun.  It's nice having the crew out there behind me and give them something to cheer about this year, which is awesome.
Q. Couple of your sponsors motivate you to play well in a couple big events as well, KPMG and Women's PGA, and you're also a spokesperson for Marathon.
STACY LEWIS: Right.
Q. Do you feel an added responsibility when you come play in their event?
STACY LEWIS: There is.  I was the one that asked Gary, the CEO, to sponsor this tournament, so, yes, there is some responsibility.  I keep telling him thank you every year for believing in me enough to put some money out there and bring the girls back every year.
Just really special to think I was that little kid running around at this tournament and now Chesnee gets to do it.  I want to keep this tournament going as long as we can.
Q. Motherhood has obviously brought a little different perspective to life and to golf.  Anything take away that desire to win?
STACY LEWIS: No.  That competitiveness has definitely not gone away.  You're still going to see me get mad.  I want to win more than ever, but I forget about it as soon as I leave here.
Q. What you do need to do this weekend to get it done?
STACY LEWIS: Make a few more putts.  Ball striking is there and the golf course gets tough late in the day, so just making a few putts we'll be in a good spot.
Q. How does it feel to go into Saturday in contention?
STACY LEWIS: It's awesome.  You know, probably didn't play as good today but managed it really good.  Couple near the lead, so I'm excited about the way I'm playing.
Looking forward to the hot weather weekend.
Q. Surprised there weren't any real low scores today?
STACY LEWIS: I thought hole locations were a little bit tougher today.  Especially late in the day greens were firm and it was hard to get it close.  I thought the golf course set up a lot tougher today.
Q. Kind of uncharted territory for you here.
STACY LEWIS: Uh-huh.
Q. What's the difference?
STACY LEWIS: Just playing better golf.  I don't know what it is.  It's nice to be in contention and feel those nerves again and what that's like.
But just playing better golf and, you know, just try to make a few more putts this weekend.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS: Well, 18 green is a little funky now, so it's not a guaranteed birdie even though it's a reachable hole.  You can actually make a mess of it pretty quickly.
If the worst thing we make is par, we're doing good.
Q. You're in contention; family is around.
STACY LEWIS: Yep.
Q. What's that like for you?
STACY LEWIS: It's just a lot of fun this year to give them something to cheer about.  They were pretty pumped after the round yesterday.  It's always fun to have them and go have those family dinners every night and just be around everybody.
It's really special, because otherwise I wouldn't get to see them this much.
Q. I would assume family dinners are very exciting when put up scores like that.
STACY LEWIS: They are.  They're fun.  The baby's kind of taken over the family dinners this year, so she's getting all the attention, which is totally fine.
Q. In some ways she takes the pressure of you this week.
STACY LEWIS: She does.  The first question is how is Chesnee versus me, and that's completely okay.
Q. I want to ask you about your round one more time.  What did you make of it out there?
STACY LEWIS: I thought I played well.  Got off to a slow start again.  Kind of like yesterday, but was just able to manage it.  Didn't hit it as good as yesterday, but golf course was set up harder.
I'm pretty happy.  Especially always following a round like that yesterday is pretty tough, so just really happy with the day.
