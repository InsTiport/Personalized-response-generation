Q. You started so well; what changed after 4?
STACY LEWIS: You know, just controlling the irons.  It's been an issue from the get-go.  Kind of had good numbers for the first few holes, and kind of ran into a streak there where I had in-between numbers and just wasn't able to control the irons.  It's something I've been working on the last few weeks, so it's not necessarily a surprise.
Q. You go into the weekend back by nine or so.  How do you change what you do going into the weekend?
STACY LEWIS: I'm just going to try to play better.  I'm not going to be looking at a leaderboard.  At this point it's now try to play better and get ready for links golf next week and just controlling ball flight and controlling spin.  That's what I'll kind of work on this weekend.
Q. What about the long sleeves, does it feel any hotter or --
STACY LEWIS: No, they're actually cooler.  It's from a company in Australia, and a lot of the girls wear them.  But it's more to protect the arms from the sun and do the best we can.
Q. You've been here for a few years.  How is 18 playing different?
STACY LEWIS: 18 doesn't really fit in with the rest of the golf course to be honest.  The green is a little funky I think for the type of shot that you're going to be hitting in.  I don't know, I had something different in my head than what they actually did, but we'll see how it plays next year once it kind of settles in because that green is really firm right now and it's really hard to read just with the patterns of the grass.
Q. What are you going to do tonight that's not golf-related to prepare for tomorrow?
STACY LEWIS: Sleep.  Yeah, it's going to be a quick turnaround, so just getting some food and some rest, and that's it.
