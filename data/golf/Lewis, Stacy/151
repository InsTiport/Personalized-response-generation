  MODERATOR:   Like to welcome Stacy Lewis to the media center after a 3‑under, 69.   Feel pretty good about that after the rough start? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, probably one of the craziest rounds of golf I've ever played.   I think I only had six pars today, so it was all over the place.
But it was nice just to finish the way that I did, to get to under par and just to really keep it around the lead.   Things could have really gone sideways today. 

Q.   You played with Sei Young, who had a walk‑off holed 8‑iron, and you hit a very similar holed 8‑iron.   Kind of feels like a kind of karma out there, doesn't it?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   Maybe she was rubbing off on me a little bit.   I just finally made a really good golf swing there.   That's the part I was most excited about, is I made a really good swing and hit the shot I was trying to hit.
Kind of just got some confidence going after that with that swing.

Q.   Did you feel something at that point in your swing?   Seemed like your ball striking improved a lot after that. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I've been kind of working on trying to get my left tip to clear a little bit better in stead of sliding in front of it. 
That was really one of the first ones that actually did it right on because I was able to kind of hold it back into the wind where everything on a left‑to‑right wind was kind of riding it and missing right.
So I was finally able to kind of hold one back in there.   Still didn't hit great shots.   Couple I would like it have back coming in.
But definitely kind of showed me that I'm working on the right things. 

Q.   So I asked Lydia this.   Everybody has talked about how difficult the golf course is, but there are a lot of red numbers on the leaderboard.   What is so difficult about it, and how do you explain people playing so well? 
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I think the hardest part is you can make a double very quickly.   It's just one of those golf courses you can't lose your focus, because then you're making a big number.
With the way the greens are sloped you can kind of work some shots into the holes and make birdies like you're seeing.   I think it's just hard from the standpoint of one swing and you're making a double.   I think that that's what makes it the hardest. 

Q.   You ever get tired of crossing paths with Lydia coming in the media center?   You guys are always coming in here almost one after another. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's cool.   I kind of laughed to myself out there.   I saw the leaderboard on I think 12 or 13.   Just kind of laughed to myself to see her name up there again.
I mean, it's not surprising.   She loves this golf course.   You kind of have to laugh, but then you kind of don't because you expect her to be there. 

Q.   Just to follow that up, I know it's early, but how would you feel about the prospect of doing it again this year?   You guys dueled for the whole weekend. 
STACY LEWIS:   I would love to.   To be in contention again, that's definitely where I want to be.   I would like to come out on the other side of it hopefully, but with this course, we both have a long ways to go.
Neither one of us are going to shoot 5‑under the next three days.   This golf course is hard, like we said.   I think we both would like to be there on Sunday.

Q.   How about just Juli Inkster?   First round, here it is her home turf; 54 years old; legend in the game coming out here and playing the way she does.   Kind of your thoughts on that.
STACY LEWIS:   I just think it's really cool.   We should take a picture and do a hashtag of a throwback Thursday with her name out there on that leaderboard up there.
Just shows how good of a player she is.   She gets what it takes to win out here and what it takes to play well.   It's just really cool being from this area I think for her to play well.   It's great for our leaderboard and this tournament.
You know, we've had a lot of Solheim Cup stuff going on too, so it's impressive that she got it going today.

Q.   One shot behind you is another 17 year old.   You have in the past had some strong opinions about young people playing.   You got a leader who turns 18 tomorrow; T8 who is 17.   Can you repeat what you've said prior about this?
STACY LEWIS:   Yes. 

Q.   What you think about college. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I still stand by the fact that I think the rules should be that you should be 18 to be a tour member.   There are always exceptions.   To every rule there are exceptions. 
In the past those have been Lydia and Lexi, and they've proved themselves and come out and won.   I think if you do that, you deserve it.   You should come out here and play. 
But I think in general most girls aren't ready for what this entails at 16, 17 years old.   I just think there is a maturity level of ‑‑ and it's not just the golf.   A lot of times their golf is ready. 
It's dealing with the sponsors, managing your schedule, doing media, and those relationships.   I don't think‑‑ not all kids are ready for that.   And they are kids.   Lydia is still a kid to me.
So not all of them are ready.   Lexi and Lydia, they've had to learn on the fly and learn how to deal with that stuff, and they'll continue to. 
But there are always exceptions. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks for coming in. 
STACY LEWIS:   Thank you.
