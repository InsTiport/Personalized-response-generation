Q. I'm alongside Stacy Lewis, who just carded a 66.  Which ties the low score of the week with Inkster and Matthew.  A tremendous day.  What a difference a day makes.  8 birdies and 4 bogeys.  What clicked for you last night on the practice putting green, that enabled you to putt so beautifully today?STACY LEWIS: We worked on alignment, and found my hands were getting a little low on setup.  And when that happens the putter breaks down and the head releases.  That's what we kind of worked on and that's all I thought of today.  And it was just a cool day.  It's amazing how your nerves start to affect you and on this golf course it makes it twice as hard.  Just feels great to finish the way I did.
Q. Birdie, birdie finish at 17 and 18.  Reminiscent of how you won the British at St. Andrews, birdieing the last two holes, you finished well ahead of the pack.  Your thoughts on what those players have to do to try to maintain that lead?STACY LEWIS: Well, it's tough.  I made some bogeys coming in.  And I think the hardest part about that final stretch now, is Michelle Wie has the nerves, she's seen the leaderboard, you have a target and a number in your head.  I knew I needed to get out early and post some numbers and make Michelle Wie earn it.
