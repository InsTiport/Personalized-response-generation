 Q.  2-under to sit at 6-under total, what's been kind of working for you this week?  
STACY LEWIS: I don't know, I mean, I'm just hitting the ball a little bit better.  The new golf ball I put in play yesterday has definitely helped.  Shots just stopping a little bit closer to the hole, doing what I think.   
But really, I've left a lot out there the last two days, which is a good thing going into the weekend.  I'm up near the lead and haven't played my best golf yet.   
 Q.  How tough is that for you to make that quick adjustment to switch balls before the start of a tournament?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, it's the third time I've done it this year.  So I've struggled all year trying to find the right combination and this one is the closest to what I was playing a year ago.  So it's actually pretty easy, because now the shots are finally coming off the way I think they should.   
 Q.  You mentioned you haven't really been playing your best golf yet.  Do you see yourself being able to go low here on the weekend?  
STACY LEWIS: This golf course is tough.  If you get on the right side of the holes, you can go low.  But you'll go on a stretch of a few holes where you have sidehill breaking putts, and they are just hard to make.  So you can't go into the round thinking, I'm going to shoot a low score.  You just have to try to get on the right side of the hole.   
 Q.  Do you feel like that benefits you, knowing how you play your game, knowing there are some holes that you have to be a little more patient with the course?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think this golf course definitely fits someone that thinks their way around a little bit more versus kind of swinging away at every pin.  I've just got to keep trying to get on the right side of the hole and making the putts.   
 Q.  What your impressions of Brooke out there today and her play a little bit?  
STACY LEWIS: Today I think she just ran out of gas a little bit.  You could just definitely tell from the quick turnaround we had last night, she was pretty tired from last week.   
But she's definitely talented.  Definitely plays like a 17-year-old, kind of going at every pin and not really knowing when to reel it back, and that's the only thing that's going to hurt you on this golf course.  But she'll learn that.  You know, she's got a lot of improvement I think still to make.   
 Q.  And you're one of those players that you have a lot of hometown events, and this is kind of a home country event for her.  That grind of trying to make the cut at the end, you've probably been through that.  What's it like, and how do you feel Brooke handled it?  
STACY LEWIS: I thought she did good.  Yesterday you could tell she was pretty nervous.  I told her afterwards, I said, "I do this a lot."  I said that, you know, "they are going to cheer for you whether you hit a good one or a bad one, so you might as well just hit a good one."  She was smiling a little bit more out there today and kind of enjoying it, which was good to see.  She's learning and she'll get there.
