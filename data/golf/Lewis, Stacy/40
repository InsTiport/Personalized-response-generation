Q. (In progress...)
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, felt good.  Just got off to a good start there on the front nine.  Would've liked to have made a few more coming in, but overall it was really solid and a good day.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS: Uh-huh.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, for sure.  Yesterday with less wind was a little bit unexpected.  I think you come to this golf course expecting to play in wind, and when we didn't yesterday kind of threw me off a little bit.
I know the wind is going to keep blowing and may be a little worse this weekend, so I'm excited about that.
Q. Wind player?  Comfortable in the wind?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I grew up in Texas playing in the wind.  I like to hit different types of shots.  Yeah, I'm okay with some holes making par as a good score and other holes you got to make birdies on.  I've loved playing in wind my whole career.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, four birdies in a row on the front there, yeah.  Hit it close par 3; then hit another really good shot on the par-5 to a couple feet; made a longer putt on 6; made probably a 25-footer; then hit it to about two feet on 7.
Just really good shots in that stretch.
Q. (Regarding wedge play.)
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, wedge play, some longer irons.  This golf course though is such an advantage with the longer hitters.  Look at the leaderboard.  You got two of our longest hitters on tour at the top.
It's just if you're not one of the longer hitters, you got to wedge it and putt it really good to stay close.
