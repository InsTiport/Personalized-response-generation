  Q. Tell me about today's round.   
 STACY LEWIS: It was awful. My swing felt bad, felt horrible over the putts. Just a really bad day.   
  
  Q. But there's always tomorrow.   
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, kind of shot myself out of the tournament today so I'm pretty frustrated with it.   
 Just go out there tomorrow and just try to move up the leaderboard.  
  
  Q. You're a veteran; Thompson is young. Tell me about her game today. How do you think she played today?   
 STACY LEWIS: I mean, she played really well. She made pretty much everything she looked at and played really solid. She played well and deserves to be where she is.
