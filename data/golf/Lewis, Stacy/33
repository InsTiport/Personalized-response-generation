Q. 4-under, what does coming to this golf course do for you both with your game and your confidence level?
STACY LEWIS: There's just such a comfort level, and I don't know what it is.  It's not one thing because it's really a pretty tricky golf course.  But I know the lines, I know the greens, and there's just a comfort level of knowing that I can go out there and play good golf.
Q. Looking back at your round today, what are you most pleased with and what needs a little bit of improvement for tomorrow?
STACY LEWIS: I took advantage of the par-5s, which I was happy with today.  You kind of have to with this wind direction we had.  And didn't putt it good early, so I need to kind of clean a few things up.  It could have been a lot better today.  Just excited to put a good number out there to start and going to take a little nap this afternoon.
Q. We've talked about your No. 1 priority in the past, your daughter Chesnee.  What's on the game plan or the docket for the afternoon?
STACY LEWIS: It's a nap for me.  It's been a long week and a long couple weeks, and we're not sleeping through the night right now, so we're going to go get some rest.
