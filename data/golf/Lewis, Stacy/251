Q.   I'm now joined by Stacy Lewis who shot 7‑under today, currently 12‑under for a two‑day total, tied for second.   You really are comfortable on this course.   You really showed that today, especially on the greens.   Take us through that Back 9.
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I got off to a little bit of a rough start, kind of got impatient on the greens and didn't birdie the par‑5s like I needed to.   I don't know, I hit it close on the par‑5s and made two pretty decent putts after that and kind of got things going in the right direction.
Like I said yesterday, at the end of this golf course you can make some birdies, so I just need to stay patient and keep hanging in there.

Q.   Six consecutive birdies on the Back 9 after your last seven holes.   Underachiever, what happened on the 18th to make it seven in a row?   What happened?
STACY LEWIS:   I was trying.   I think my record is seven, so I was trying to tie that.   I hit a good shot, hit to like five or six feet, but unfortunately the putt hit a ball mark, but I can't complain too much.   7‑under is a good score today.

Q.   Seeing Jess and Na Yeon go out 9‑under yesterday, everyone says it's scorable conditions here, they knew there would be some low scores.   Is that kind of extra motivation seeing that go down in the first round?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I mean I didn't quite see 9‑under on that golf course, but to watch Na Yeon do it, you know, you could see it was out there. 
So you know, it's staying patient.   That's the biggest thing.   There are some holes that you just take your pars and move on and there's other ones you can make birdies on. 

Q.   All right.   Well, awesome job today.   Good luck the rest of the week.
STACY LEWIS:   Thank you.

Q.   You've said you like this golf course, feel very comfortable.   You've played in Asia a bunch over your career.   Scorable conditions and everyone's been saying there's birdies to be had, which you've taken opportunity of.   What do you think is going to be key for the next two days to really kind of put up big numbers?
STACY LEWIS:   When I first played this course, I didn't think ‑‑ honestly didn't think all these low numbers were even out there, but watching Na Yeon Choi shoot 9‑under yesterday kind of opened my eyes a little bit, and I think that's what you have to keep doing the rest of the week, you have to just keep making birdies and birdie the par‑5s and just keep giving yourself a chance at the end because showing what I did today, I think anyone is possible at the end of the day. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   Jess has become a good friend and she's a great player and this golf course really suits her game really well because it's high and far.   I think that's the key to this course is to be able to carry it on to the Green and stop it.
I like playing with her and I think we're both going to make a ton of birdies the next two days, so it'll be a lot of fun. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
STACY LEWIS:   I think since we're trying to play golf, I think the cameras are more annoying.   But they're both things you just kind of have to deal with and everybody's having to deal with it, so you just kind of have to go with it.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
STACY LEWIS:   You know, Inbee has a pretty big lead now which she deserves since she won three majors, but I mean my goal is always to win the tournament and then hopefully, you know, that keeps me moving up in position.   I want to get back to No. 1 in the world but I think Inbee has such a good lead right now that I don't think it ‑‑ hopefully ‑‑ I don't know if by the end of the year I'll be able to catch her or not, but that's kind of my goal going forward is to get back to No. 1 in the world.
