 Q.  You played well at this course seems like a few years ago and then you played well again today.  What is it about this golf course that really just suits your game?  
STACY LEWIS: I don't know if it's the golf course necessarily, but I just played better than I've been playing lately.  Things just seemed to click a little better today.  I actually switched golf balls yesterday, so just tried a new golf ball today, and it was a lot better.  I was able to free it up a little more.   
But you can shoot a number on this golf course.  You have to make some birdies on the par-5s, and when you have wedges in your hand and make a lot of pars coming in.   
 Q.  So what is the new golf ball?  
STACY LEWIS: It's still a Bridgestone.  It's actually a B330-S.  It's the third Bridgestone I've played this year.  So it's just been more of a struggle than I thought to find the right combination of everything.   
I noticed a difference around the greens.  It was a lot better today and actually picked up some distance off the tee back to where I was hitting it last year.  So good so far, I guess.   
 Q.  I was going to say, I know the frustration you've had in not finding the game and putting it all together at the same time.  How nice was it to feel that today that it seemed to be coming together?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, it was nice to just see the ball coming off the club the way I expected it to.  There is a lot of times in the last few weeks that I made bogeys with wedges and 9 irons and missing greens, and it's just that's frustrating golf to me because you just can't do that stuff.  Just shots coming off the way I wanted them to, spinning the way they should.  It's been a really long, frustrating year, and a lot of relief in today's round.   
 Q.  You played with Brooke.  We all know this is her first week as a member.  To see the crowds out here that were following her and the interest, how impressed are you with her with what she's been able to do with all the attention and focus and whirlwind?  
STACY LEWIS: Going into the day I knew there were going to be a lot of people out here.  It's kind of a reverse for me.  I'm usually the one with the hometown crowd.  I could definitely see there were some nerves in the first few holes and coming in there, but she did really good.  She hung in there, and I hope she can enjoy it a little more the rest of the week when she gets the nerves out of there.   
 Q.  This is the last week for Solheim Cup points.  You don't have to worry about any of that.  But as you get ready for Solheim, is that your game coming together?  Does it feel like a good time for that?  One more major to go and then Solheim?  
STACY LEWIS: Oh, sure.  Just I wanted to finish the year out strong.  I'm in a position money list wise and everything that my standards it's not been a good year, but I have an opportunity to still make it a good year.  So I just want to finish out the year really good so it doesn't hurt that Solheim's around the corner.  It's fun watching the leaderboard and seeing who is playing well and whose not.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next few days.
