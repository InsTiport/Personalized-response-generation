 Q.   Brooke Henderson right now is 2‑Under out there.   Pretty impressed with that from a 17 year old?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, this golf course is just playing hard, so I mean, I think it's one of those days where you're not really looking a the on the leaderboard.  
    That's probably to her advantage right now.   
   
 Q.   1‑under today.   What did you think of your round?  
    STACY LEWIS:   It was all right.   You know, I definitely‑‑ I got off to a bad start so to shoot 1‑under was pretty good.   Definitely left some out there, but overall pretty help.  
    Get really tough there at the end and really gusty.   Just got hard to make the short putts.  
   
 Q.   Morgan 5‑under, 67 today.   How good is that out there?   
    STACY LEWIS:   That was really impressive.   I think that's more impressive than what Brooke did.   
    That score today is playing some golf.  
   
 Q.   What have you noticed out of Morgan lately?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think the main thing is her golf swing.   I think she's got more control of it.   Club is in a better place to the top.   You can definitely see that.   
    She's picked up distance over the last couple years, so you can finally just kind of see her getting comfortable with the swing chances.  
   
 Q.   Did you notice her swing getting to where you were like, That's not the best position or the position she used to be in?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, her golf swing, you know, I wouldn't say it's textbook ever, but you could definitely tell that the club was not in the right place at the top where she could get it back to impact exact.  
    I think what you're seeing now is the club is in a better place to the top and she's not relying so much on timing, which you're seeing better golf week in and week out.  
   
 Q.   Six back, but basically I think you're fifth or six right now.   
    STACY LEWIS:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   Is it different knowing that Brooke is 17 and has never been in that position as far as chasing as opposed to if Lydia were there or somebody else were?   You think about it any different?   
    STACY LEWIS:   No.   I think this golf course, five, six shots is really not that much.   You go out and post a number like Morgan did today ‑‑ I mean, I think we're still going to get some wind tomorrow so it's still going to play hard.  
    You go out there and post five, six under, I think you got to a chance at the end of the day tomorrow.   This golf course is too hard for someone to just kind of run away with it.  
   
 Q.   You like the wind or not?  
    STACY LEWIS:   I do, I like the wind.   I like when it plays hard and you got to kind of fight it out a little bit.  
   
 Q.   You get to see that a lot down there in Jupiter, too.   
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, Florida, Texas, seems to be everywhere I've been there seems to be wind.  
   
 Q.   What's the key playing in the wind like that today?  
    STACY LEWIS:   It's just trying not to do too much with it.   Especially on this golf course.   You get short sided on this golf course, you're making a bogey really quick.   It's just staying patient and not trying to do too much with it.  
   
 Q.   Pleased with the week so far?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, somewhat.   I've made too many stupid bogeys, too many bogeys from inside 100 yards this week to have been up near the lead going into tomorrow.  
    But I'm still hanging around.   I'm in position where a good round tomorrow has a chance.   
   
 Q.   What's the most you've ever came back from on Sunday to win?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Seven in Japan a couple years ago, so it's definitely doable.  
   
 Q.   What did you shoot that day?  
    STACY LEWIS:   63.   That would be nice tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Will you look at the leaderboards tomorrow or just go out there and try to be as aggressive as possible and post a number and not worry about it?  
    STACY LEWIS:   I'll watch a little bit because I like to see how people are playing and stuff like that.  
    It's trying to hit as many greens as I can.   That's what I need to do tomorrow:   Hit a bunch of greens and keep giving myself putts at it because I'm putting well.  
   
 Q.   What do you think you would've been like if you had the lead out here at 17?  
    STACY LEWIS:   I would've never been here at 17.   It's amazing, but it's kind of becoming a norm now.   I don't think it's quite as amazing an accomplishment.  
    Lydia won when she was 15; Lydia has four or five wins now.  
   
 Q.   Six.   
    STACY LEWIS:   And she just turned 18.   While it is still amazing as a 17 year old, it's kind of becoming old hat.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it's kind of one of those things where Lexi and then Lydia kind of gives more confidence as they come up?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, just shows that, I mean, everybody plays their best golf at different ages.   For these girls it's younger than most.  
    For me, I was never even close to playing that level of golf at 17.   Everybody is different, you know, but definitely these kids see Lydia doing that, and they played with her in amateur and junior golf, and I think it does opens their dreams and horizons.  
   
 Q.   You seen Brooke hit at all this week?  
    STACY LEWIS:   I haven't.  
   
 Q.   Ever played with her?  
    STACY LEWIS:   No.   Got nothing there.
