  Q. Can I walk with you?   
 STACY LEWIS: That's fine.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your day and your latest round and your position overall?  
 STACY LEWIS: I played really good all day. I'm frustrated with the way I finished. It's unfortunate we didn't get done today.   
  
  Q. What do you do now just after having such a long day? What do you do to refresh? Like you're going to dinner right now?  
 STACY LEWIS: Go to bed. You eat a little bit and go to bed and try to get ready for tomorrow. I don't know how you do, but we've got to restart at 7:00. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Have you had this experience before, just all the different delays and the different times?  
 STACY LEWIS: A little bit, yeah. I was surprised we started so early again. We're starting at 7:00; they started at 7:45 this morning. I'm surprised at that.   
 Do what you got to do, I guess.
