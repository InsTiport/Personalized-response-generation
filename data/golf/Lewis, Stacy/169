Q.   You're hot onto the lead. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, that's pretty much the only good thing that came out of today.   It was bit all over the place today.   Played six really bad holes to kind of start the day but then got things going.
This 18th hole just frustrates me.   Over the years it's gotten my number more times than it's been good.

Q.   Let's focus on a good part of your round.   Great drive on the 15th hole. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, just tried it hit a little driver.   If I hit it too hard it would've gone too far, so I took a little off of it and it worked out pretty good. 
So it was good.   I needed that to just get back on track a little bit.

Q.   Are you going to hit balls now?
STACY LEWIS:   I'll be around the putting and chipping green.   The ball‑striking really was not that bad.   Just got short‑sided in some bad situations.   Hit some good shots, hit some shots too far actually.   This new golf ball in the heat is going a bit.
