  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Stacy Lewis into the interview room.   I know you had a bogey on 18, but could you just take me through the day. 
STACY LEWIS:   I really didn't play very good today.   I struggled hitting the ball, didn't really give myself many chances at birdies.   Then kind of made some putts at the end. 
I don't know why the tee shot on 18 just doesn't fit my eye.   I improved on yesterday, but I have to figure out how to get the ball on the fairway there. 
THE MODERATOR:   You have your family and friends out here with bright shirts.   How is that for you? 
STACY LEWIS:   It's awesome.   I was trying to give them something to cheer for today.   I made a couple putts. 
Last couple years, they've grown in numbers, gotten more shirts every year.   It's really cool to have them out there.   I don't think anybody else has anything like it, so it's pretty cool. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Roughly how big was your entourage today? 
STACY LEWIS:   My entourage?   I don't know, maybe 30 people today.   I think they ordered about 130 Tâ€‘shirts.   Who knows what it will be like this weekend when the weather's a little better. 
Family, friends, a few people from one of my sponsors, Marathon. 

Q.   Is it in any way a distraction at all? 
STACY LEWIS:   I don't think so.   I think I kind of put more pressure on myself just knowing they're there and wanting to play well for them.   I have to kind of get back to how I've been playing the rest of this year so far, just try not to force things so much. 
I just want to play well for them.   That's kind of always in the back of my mind. 
THE MODERATOR:   How was it been being back in Toledo for this event? 
STACY LEWIS:   It's fun.   It's cool to come back as I've been playing better.   It's weird, we had a big family dinner last night, went to a restaurant.   People were coming up for autographs.   Everybody kind of recognized who I was. 
It's cool to go to all these towns again and people are starting to realize who I am.   Kind of fans have grown every year. 

Q.   The year is not over yet, but you are No.1 right now.   First of all, did you ever think you'd be there?   Is there pressure dealing with that, being on top?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's something that you work really hard for, then it actually happens.   I don't know, I still have to kind of look at the rankings, look at the Money List to make sure they're right. 
It's surprising.   I don't know.   You work really hard to do it, but to actually see that there, it's kind of strange. 
It's not really any pressure because I still just want to try to win golf tournaments.   At the end of the day, if I'm still on those lists at the end of the year, that's a pretty good thing. 

Q.   Looking at your scorecard yesterday and today, the scores are almost the same.   You played most of the holes different.   Did the course just play that different?   Did it kind of reverse in terms of which holes were accessible today? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, the wind was the opposite direction.   I think that affected a lot of the way the different holes played.   Some were shorter, some were longer. 
I thought it played a little tougher today because the conditions early on, we had some rain, just figuring out how far the ball was going.   The wind started to swirl there at the end. 
I don't know.   I think the course I thought played a little tougher, but we'll see what happens. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you. 
STACY LEWIS:   Thank you.
