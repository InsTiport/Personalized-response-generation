Q. The way you finished and been playing all week, how do you think that helps you prepare for next week?
STACY LEWIS: Well, today was really nice.  Today, especially the first I mean 10, 12 holes I played were really good.  Had some awkward numbers there at the end, but really just excited about the way I played.
Felt really comfortable.  I made some good putts when I needed to.  Overall, the week was really solid and something I needed going into a major.
Q. I was watching on a couple holes, and looked like you were really comfortable over the ball on the putting green.  Is that something you think started to developed and you feel a lot better with now?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, the putting got better every day this week.  I am more comfortable today.  These greens got so firm and fast at the edged the day.  It was just hard to make putts.
Made some good par putts.  Those are the ones, some little 4- and 5-footers, those are the ones you need at a major championship.  I did that today under pressure.  Definitely much more comfortable with the putter.
