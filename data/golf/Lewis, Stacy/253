  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Rolex Rankings No. 2, Stacy Lewis, into the interview.   Thank you for joining us today.   You've had a lot of success here at this venue.   I know it's a little different golf course now with the redesign.   Finished runner up the last twoyears.   Is there any difference coming to Evian with this major title and how does your experience in the past here help you? 
    STACY LEWIS:   I really don't think this tournament changes a lot, I mean, for the players.   This was one of our biggest purses anyway.   I think your approach changes.   I don't think‑‑ for me the mentality doesn't really change.   It's still a good tournament you are trying to win, so whether it has a major title or not doesn't really matter to me. 
    It is nice coming back.   The last twoyears I obviously played really well here.   I have good memories, so it's nice coming back to that.
    A little disappointed that the golf course is a different just because I played well on the other one.   It is what it is and you go out there and try do this again.

Q.   I know you won the last major that we played at the women's British.   Is there something different though when you capture a major victories and you start adding those to your rÃ©sumÃ©?
    STACY LEWIS:   I think that's what everybody plays for is to win majors.   It's nice winning other events, but to have the majors, I think that's the ultimate for me. 
    The British was just awesome.   It's still kind of sinking in that I won there.   Now knowing that we have another opportunity to win a major and add that to our rÃ©sumÃ©.

Q.   Overall when you look at your career over the past year, what you have been able to do really in the last twoyears, what has been the biggest difference for you and how has that translated to the success that we've seen?
    STACY LEWIS:   I mean, it's really kind of been a slow progress for me.   I think that my golf swing getting better, putting getting better just kind of gradually.   But I think a lot of it is being comfortable, being comfortable in those last groups, being comfortable with your name on the leaderboard, with all the attention, with people expecting you to win.   It's a different mentality there.   It's just getting comfortable there.   I feel like I've done a good job of learning and trying to adjust to it and I continue to do that.

Q.   Inbee said that she now looks at you as kind of a rival, someone that every time she finishes, she looks up to see what you've shot and that you keep pushing her to be even better.   How has that developed for you as well?   You guys have been close even with the remarkable year that Inbee has had? 
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I watch Yani a lot when she was in her run.   We seemed to play a lot together, so I learned a lot playing with Yani and kind of watched what she was doing. 
    Now you're kind of doing the same with Inbee.   We're making each better.   We're pushing to work harder.   I think it's great for both of us. 
    I've had different people throughout my career that that have made me better.   As players that's what we're always trying to do.   I'm trying to hang with Inbee.   I have got to win two majors to keep up with her.   I'm just trying to hang in with her. 
    I do, I watch her scores.   I watch what she's doing.   I watch how she is preparing, how she is cutting.   I think you can learn a lot by watching people when they are playing their best.

Q.   Could you tell us who you work with on your golf swing and do you have a separate coach for short game and do you have a mental coach? 
    STACY LEWIS:   I work with Joe Hallet.   He is based in Nashville, Tennessee.   I worked with him since the end of my rookie year.   I basically do everything with him.   I do my long game, I do short game. 
    I use AimPoint.   I work with Mark Sweeney a little bit. 
    But mental side, I don't really have a mental coach.   I count on people that I've talked to throughout my career.   I have different coaches from college that I might talk to.   I don't like really like people telling me how to think so I kind of figure it out myself.

Q.   Can you give me a few of your takes on the new layout on the course and what do you think about it?
    STACY LEWIS:   It's interesting.   I think it it's hard to tell with this first year.   I don't think the golf course is quite ready for us.   Give it another year, I think it will be in really good shape.   I don't think we're quite playing it the way it's supposed to be played. 
    There are some good changes.   There are some maybe I don't quite agree with.   I think it's too early to kind of judge what the changes are.

Q.   What is the biggest differences? 
    STACY LEWIS:   Obviously the biggest difference is the greens.   I think some were made bigger, some were made smaller.   Some have more humps in them, some have less humps in them.
    The biggest difference is the greens and then the finishing holes.   I do like the 16, 17, 18.   I like the changes there.   I think they have a lot more going on at those last few holes.   But, I don't know, the biggest difference is the greens. 
    Off the tee shots are a little different, some bunkering and things like that.   They are still kind of hidden off the side.   They didn't level those out at all.   You are hitting off the slope still and you just now hit to the right spots of the green.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
    STACY LEWIS:   Pretty open question.   I mean, obviously it's been great for women's golf.   It's very impressive what she's done. 
    It started at this tournament last year.   She really started playing golf, good golf.   You look back over the last year and what she's accomplished and it's very impressive.   She is great to play with, fun to play with.   It's a little bit of getting the attention she deserves.   It took her a while, but she's getting it.

Q.   Coming off the victory at the women's British, second at Safeway, how do you feel about your game right now?   I know every season goes through ups and downs, but what is the state of your game at this moment?
    STACY LEWIS:   Obviously I'm in a good place.   Going bogey‑free, that was kind of one of the things ‑‑ my coach and I, we put goals in the back of our minds that aren't related to winning tournaments or anything like that.   It was one of those I had in my mind but I never thought it was possible, and to actually do it is really cool.   It just shows how consistent I was.   I hit some bad shots, but I got over it and I was able to get up‑and‑down from 100 yards a couple of times. 
    It just shows my game is in a good place.   I'm hitting fairways, hitting greens, making putts.   I'm excited about where my game is at.
    Now, this week, it's learning a new golf course and knowing where you can miss it and where you can't.   I think that is the biggest issue this week. 

Q.   Looking from the outside, you seem like you have got much stronger mentally.   I mean, you still seem to me to be hard on yourself, but it doesn't seem to affect you in a negative way any more?
    STACY LEWIS:   I think that's been a lot of the difference the last couple of years.   I'm always going to be hard on myself, that's just the way it is, but I had to find a way to not make it carry over to the next hole, to the next round.   It's a struggle.   It still is.   I wouldn't say it's perfect yet.   It's never ever going to be.
    It's definitely changed the way I played.   I wouldn't have won the British if I hadn't gotten better at that the last few years.   I wouldn't have been bogey‑free at Safeway.   It's something I continually have to work with to kind of reel it back in and realize you are not going to be perfect out there.   It's something that happened me a lot over the last few years.

Q.   The Solheim Cup experience, is that something you just flush out or to do you examine it and take things a way from it? 
    STACY LEWIS:   I think you take a little bit from it, but for me there are a lot of things that happened that were out of my control.   I've been a person if I can't control it then I can't worry about it. 
    There are a lot of things that happened that I couldn't control.   I have got to find a way to move on from them.   I don't really know what I'm going to take from that yet.   I don't think I quite figured that out. 
    I learned a lot playing with Paula; I know that.   I learned about how to win those matches that are tight at the end, how do keep your head in there.   I think that keeps getting me mentally stronger.
