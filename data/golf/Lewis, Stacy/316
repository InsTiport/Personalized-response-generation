 Q. Stacy, 6-under ties the tournament record. And you actually tied the nine-hole record. So can you just take me through the day a little bit and what was working? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I guess the front nine, I was hitting good putts, but wasn't playing being any putts and made a bad swing on 9 and made double. That almost got me more focused and started hitting good golf shots and putts started going in and things started going anyway in the back.

 Q. How tough is it when you have two days and to keep your focus when you go back out there?
 STACY LEWIS: It's hard, because you just don't know when you're going to go. The first time we went out, we didn't get to hit any balls, and you just don't know what you're going to hit it like or what your feel is going to be like and you don't really know what to expect. I got out there and made birdie coming in after the delay so it was good.

 Q. Is it difficult to keep your momentum, especially on a back nine like you were having?
 STACY LEWIS: I was disappointed because I made four in a row and had a good chance on the par 5 and it just killed the momentum. I was happy with the way I played coming out. 

 Q. Being tied for the lead after two rounds, I know it's still early in the week but has to be a good feeling for how you're playing?
 STACY LEWIS: I struggled last week and so it's nice to just get out there and shoot some good scores, and seeing putts going in is always a good thing. 

 Q. State of your game now, very pleased? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, very pleased. One bad swing on the back nine but other than that the game feels good. 
 I hit a good drive and just hit a little 6-iron in and just didn't really trust it and kind of bailed on it and it went in the water. But you're going to make a bad swing, especially on this golf course, there's enough water, you're going to hit it in the water at some point and hopefully that's my mistake for the week.

 Q. Anything that you're focused on?
 STACY LEWIS: No, just still trying to make putts. You've got to make birdies I think. The golf course is a little easier this year so you have to make birdies and just keep it in the fairways.
