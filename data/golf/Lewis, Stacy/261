Q.   So Caroline holed out to retain it.   First loss on home soil.   Just sum up how you feel. 
STACY LEWIS:   Well it was pretty disappointing.   Obviously, yesterday afternoon hurt us a lot.   We just couldn't get any good momentum going early and it's disappointing.   But they holed putts when they needed to and hit the shots. 

Q.   Just for a captain like Meg, who everybody adores, and even on the other team, how do you think she will handle it?   What do you think she will say to you guys tonight?
STACY LEWIS:   I think she will be fine.   She will have a smile on her face, I'm sure.   She had one on her face last night. 
She never gave up on us, and we never gave up on her, and this team bonded better than any team has ever before.   So I think that we have all learned a lot from this and we'll all be okay.

Q.   Did you feel throughout the week, that there was extra pressure on you guys, just because Europe was coming with the cup?
STACY LEWIS:   Well there's always pressure to win, whether we're ‑‑ whether we won it last year, whether we didn't, whether we're home, whether we're away.   There's always pressure and they're a great team. 
They're getting better every year, and they're making this what it should be.   So it's good for the event, it's good for women's golf.   We saw a lot of good, close matches this week.   But we'll be fired up and ready to go next time.

Q.   What will you take away from this week personally?
STACY LEWIS:   I learned a lot playing with Paula yesterday.   How to play in these matches.   And it definitely helped me today.   Anna played great and we were back and forth all day, and that's what helped me get that half point.   So I learned how to manage these rounds and play at a Solheim Cup, and I think it's going to help me going forward.
