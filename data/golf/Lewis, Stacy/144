Q. Stacy, all along you were saying you were close, and today ball-striking was fantastic.  What finally clicked?STACY LEWIS: Well, it's still close.  It's still not quite there.  But we worked a lot the last four or five days and I really had to think a lot out there.  It wasn't like I just got up there and hit it every time.  I was really thinking a lot about my golf swing. So I've still got a couple more weeks before I'm really kind of freeing it up and just playing golf.  So just got to keep fighting through it, so we're at least on the right track now.  That's what I'm most happy about.Q. After all you had going on outside the ropes, was it a relief to be inside the ropes?STACY LEWIS: I've been saying all week I can't wait to tee it up because of all that's going on.  It's a good thing but nice to be inside the ropes and what we're here for to play some golf.  It's really cool to see everything coming together.  We've been working on this for so long, and to see the result of all the hard work of a lot of people was pretty cool.Q. A lot of guys will say that this is the worst I could have shot or I got the best out of this round.  It looked like 3-under was the worst you could have shot?STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it could have been a lot better.  I didn't make some key putts that I needed to for par.  I had some good looks for par putts and just didn't make them.  Missed some birdie putts.  But all in all, honestly the way I felt last weekend and even Monday with working on the golf swing, I'm really happy with the start.
