  STACY LEWIS:   I was in a couple divots and it was just kind of a strange day.   I'm definitely disappointed, but I made some putts there on the back nine, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   How important was it to get a couple coming in, like you said, didn't have your best stuff today?  
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I knew I needed to stay around par, and that was my goal when I made the turn is try and get back to even.   This course you're never really out of it.   You can shoot a good number one day and be right there.   I just kind of had to fight through it a little bit today.  
   
 Q.   What are the positives from today that you can take into Friday?  
STACY LEWIS:   I drove it really well off the tee.   That was one thing, I gave myself a lot of opportunities out of the fairways and I made some putts, and my speed was really good, especially on the back nine.   Gosh, I had probably three putts go over the edge.   I mean, the game is there, it's just getting a few things to go your way.   
   
 Q.   What happened right there on (inaudible)?  
STACY LEWIS:   The ball moved.  
   
 Q.   Was she just asking for like‑‑  
STACY LEWIS:   Well, yeah, because they changed the rule that if a gust of wind or some outside agent could cause it, then it's not a penalty, but since there was no wind there, she just wanted to make sure she had to move it back kind of thing.  
   
 Q.   That's bad luck, isn't it?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think it's one of the worst rules in golf that we have.   She didn't cause that to move, it just kind of settled into a spot, and it's unfortunate.  
   
 Q.   Scores aren't that low.   Are you reasonably pleased considering that?  
STACY LEWIS:   Well, considering I made a triple and I shot 1‑over, yes, it's good.   You know, the greens might be as firm as I've ever seen them for early in the week.   Fairways‑‑ the problem is you land short, it hits and stops.   You land on the green and it releases.   The greens are firm and it's playing hard, so I knew I just‑‑ if I could somehow on the back nine get it back to even, I would be right there.   
   
 Q.   The swing that led to the triple, what happened?   
STACY LEWIS:   I just‑‑ I don't think I had a good number until the second hole‑‑ my 10th or 11th hole.   I was just in between clubs all day and just didn't trust the swing, and that was it.
