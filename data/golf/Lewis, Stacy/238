Q.   A little up and down.   Weather was obviously a little bit of an issue in the morning.
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, just had the rain to start and just changed the way the golf course played.   Kind of took me a couple holes to adjust to that. 
Once I did I hit some good shots.   You just had to be a lot more aggressive, fly back to holes we normally can't do that.   Just played completely different than it ever has.

Q.   Greens everyone is saying are super soft. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, very soft.   There were a lot of back pins today, so it was hard to get the ball to stay up on those back shelves and get yourself to fly them all the way back there.

Q.   Fairways obviously not giving you too many extra yards.   Changing yardages at all?
STACY LEWIS:   We haven't been getting a lot of roll all week, so it didn't play too much longer off the tee.   Just a lot of the back pins and having to carry it so much that made to feel like it played longer.

Q.   Anything stick out good or bad?
STACY LEWIS:   Just making all our birdies, which is always good news.   If I can just clean up a few shots here and there, I will be fine.

Q.   What were the mistakes you thought mostly?
STACY LEWIS:   It was just kind of only random things:   Couple threeâ€‘putts and then a bad drive got me in trouble.   Wasn't one specific thing.   Just a couple random shots.

Q.   Nothing to be too worried about?
STACY LEWIS:   No.   I made some more putts today which I didn't do yesterday, so I am definitely pleased with that. 
Hit the ball a lot better.   Just need to make a few more putts.
