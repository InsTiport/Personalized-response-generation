 Q. Your thoughts on today's play?   
STACY LEWIS:   I did a lot of good things; this course doesn't really show it.   I hit a lot of good shots and I made a few putts, but not as many as I would have liked.   
And the wind started to blow at the end so got pretty tough those last five holes.   
   
 Q.   How frustrating is it, like you said, when you feel like things are there but it just isn't going your way?   
STACY LEWIS:   It's definitely frustrating.   It's a Major, and you want to play well here, but that's golf.   Some weeks it's going to all come together and other weeks it's going to be tough, and you gotta fight through it.   But I'm in a good spot, I'm a few back of the lead going into the weekend on this golf course; I'm right in it.  
   
 Q.   What are the things you look forward to bringing into the weekend?   
STACY LEWIS:   Today I hit my irons better than yesterday, so I'm excited about that.   I hit the pin on 14; I was ready after that shot yesterday.   I need a few more bounces to go my way and to hit a few more fairways and I'll be right there.   
   
 Q.   Little doubt if Travis would be on the bag.   How good was it to see a familiar face?   
STACY LEWIS:   He was fine.   The media hyped it up to more than it was.   He felt a little off the last few days and needed some fluids to get going again, but he felt great today and I was glad to have him.
