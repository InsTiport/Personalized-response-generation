 Q.  What do you think of the week?  STACY LEWIS: Well, it was an awesome week for us.  It showcased the Tour really well.  Westchester was a great host and it was a really, really good first year for the tournament.   Q.  You had a lot of involvement in this event obviously.  Did it exceed your expectations?  STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think just kind of seeing the behind the scenes and what it took to put all this on is pretty amazing to finally see it all come together.  I know that ideas are already flowing for next year out at Sahalee, and I can't wait to get out there.  This is just a steppingstone.  I think there are going to be more good things to come.   Q.  I saw you give John (Veihmeyer) a hug off the 18th green.  What did you say to him?  STACY LEWIS: I just told him thank you.  I said it was just an awesome week and just thank you.  You can't say that enough when you have a CEO of a company that wants to see our events treated like men's majors -- you know, that's what we need more of out on this tour.
