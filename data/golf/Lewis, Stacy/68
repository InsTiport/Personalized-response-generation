 Q.  3-under, worth getting up early for?  
STACY LEWIS: It was.  The weather wasn't good this morning but definitely got off to a great start.  It was super hard out there and just really happy, happy to be done and getting to warm up.   
 Q.  A bit of everything out there for the weather, strong winds and then no rain and then there was a lot of rain.  How were you coping?  
STACY LEWIS: Actually, playing in the Pro-Am yesterday might have helped me a little bit.  I had to play in a ton of rain yesterday, so it really wasn't as bad.  The wind was very tough, though.  Our first nine holes, it wasn't too bad but as soon as we made the turn it got pretty tough there early on our back nine.  You've just got to do what you've got to do.  You don't worry about whether it's a good or bad shot.  You just try to get it up-and-down.   
 Q.  And a nice run of birdies?  
STACY LEWIS: I did, and they were great shots.  One was with a 5-iron and the other was with a 3-wood into a par 4.  I hit the ball great all day and just gave myself a lot of good chances and missed it in the right places, which is I think the key to links golf.   
I think the front nine of this golf course, I think it's a lot harder than the back nine.  So I knew, I actually like starting 10, because I thought that was going to be to my advantage.  Those first kind of 3,4, 5, those holes played so hard, dead into the wind.  It was just trying to make pars and move on.  Play slows down and your body gets a little colder.  It was tough getting it to the house.  But I played really solid, so I can't be too upset.   
 Q.  How difficult is it when conditions are more severe than you're used to, how much of a factor is it?  
STACY LEWIS: It's an adjustment but I love links golf personally.  The fact that this became an LPGA event, it was immediately on my schedule.  Just another opportunity to play links golf, I'm going to jump on.  It's hard; it's difficult, but I think I always play better in those conditions and that's part of why I like it.  It's about thinking your way around a golf course and having strategy.  You might miss a green on purpose because that's the easiest place to get up-and-down.   
 Q.  You said two shots in particular?  
STACY LEWIS: 15, the par 3, hit 5-iron to about two feet.  And then 16, hit 3-wood in there to about eight feet and it was a back pin.  Those are definitely the shots of the day.   
 Q.  What did you do on 14?  
STACY LEWIS: I was on the green in two on the par 5.   
 Q.  And just left the putt on 9?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I thought I made that putt on 9.  Hit it right where I wanted to.  Was just hoping the wind was going to blow it in there.   
 Q.  Did you hope for no wind or decent weather?  
STACY LEWIS: I mean, I'm okay with a little bit of wind.  When it rains, it gets pretty tough.  But a little bit of wind is what you'd expect.  On Tuesday when I played a practice round, it was sunny out and no wind.  It just didn't feel right being over here.  So this is more what it should be.   
 Q.  Is it the challenge of links golf you enjoy; the fact you've got to think things?  
STACY LEWIS: I enjoy the challenge.  I enjoy that you can hit so many different shots.  You can putt from 40 yards or you can hit probably ten other clubs in your bag from that distance.  I just like how creative you can be and it's not -- and every day, we play this golf course, it's going to play different.  Doesn't matter the wind direction.  It's always playing different.   
I might hit a few wedges but I'm going to go rest and take it easy this afternoon.   
 Q.  How excited are you heading up to St. Andrews?  
STACY LEWIS: It's the first time I've been back since winning British Open.  I'm definitely going to wander out there to the 18th green and check things out.  There's something about the British Open, just seems to put me in a good mood.   
 Q.  Do you see this as ideal preparation for next week?  
STACY LEWIS: Oh, for sure.  The worst thing is probably just the energy level, keeping the energy up, playing in conditions like this.  But the more you can do this, the better you're going to be at it.   
 Q.  I know it's Kingsbarns, but will you do anything similar to what you did when you won at St. Andrews, same house or anything?  
STACY LEWIS: I stayed at the Dunvegan when I won and we're staying there again.  As soon as I won, Sheena booked that for us.   
 Q.  Do they still own it?  
STACY LEWIS: Part of their deliberations on who they were going to sell it to was they wanted to be around for next week, so that was a condition in the sale.  So they are going to be around next week and helping the new owners' transition.
