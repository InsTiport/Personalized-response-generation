 Q.  Shot your lowest round of the year.  What was the most important part of your game to accomplish that?  
STACY LEWIS: I hit it good and putted well.  That's kind of the combination that's been missing, is just putting both of them together.  Finally did it on the same day.   
It was nice playing with Inbee.  Hadn't played with her in a while.  I love playing with her because she hits so many good putts.  Kind of get some confidence just seeing the ball roll really well.   
 Q.  At what point in the round did you realize you had it all together today?  
STACY LEWIS: I would say kind of early on in the front nine.  Just kind of felt really solid with the way I was hitting it.  Just needed to stay patient.  Made some longer putts there on 4 and 6, so those were kind of a bonus to keep the day going.   
 Q.  Yeah, but your scoring kicked in later on in the day.  You had three birdies in a row coming down the stretch.  What kicked into gear?  
STACY LEWIS: Just the putter.  I had hit a lot of good shots; just hadn't made any putts.  Made probably two putts close to 30 feet; hit one in there close; hit one in close on my second to the last hole on 8.   
All in all, just a really pretty easy 65.   
 Q.  And when the ball finally starts dropping in the hole, is that situation where you want to just keep playing because those birdies are finally cashing in?  
STACY LEWIS: I know.  You kind of wish I didn't tee off until tomorrow afternoon.  Wish you could just start again tomorrow morning.   
I'm looking forward to get a little rest.  We've had a ling couple nights with the baby, so I'm looking forward to having some time off this afternoon.   
 Q.  You called it an easy 65.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.  I hadn't had a round like that yet this year.  Just a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  Didn't necessarily start that way, but just found a good rhythm.  Made couple longer putts.   
Just hadn't had a round this year yet where I put the ball-striking and putting together.   
 Q.  This course last year, I don't know, results-wise did you like the course when you first came here?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, last year it was super firm and so I did not like the golf course.  Just felt like you didn't get rewarded with good shots, and it was a little bit of goofy golf.   
Now the greens are much more receptive and you can just hit a lot better golf shots.  They're still difficult to putt, but I just feel like you get rewarded more for good shots.   
 Q.  Is there some momentum carrying over from the good start in Hawaii?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I played a bad nine holes really in Hawaii when you add it all up.  Really the last month or so I really felt like I played pretty well.   
Like I said, I haven't put it together in one day.  One day I putted good and next day hit the driver good.  It's just nice to see it all coming together.  I know it's in there.  It's just kind of getting it all going at the same time.   
 Q.  Have you gotten into a good rhythm with the baby and the competition, or is it different every week?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it's different.  I mean, I think the last two nights combined I've had about nine hours of sleep.  We had a three-hour night two nights ago.  So a little bit of a rhythm just with day care and kind of how all that goes and dropping her off.   
Really with the baby it's different every day.  She could be in a great mood and all of a sudden she's screaming and you don't know why.  And we're getting teeth, so it's just the age that she is.   
It's a little hard right now, but do I feel like golf-wise I'm able to come out here and play and kind of focus on what I'm doing just knowing that she's okay and she's taken care of.  I don't have to worry about her at all.   
 Q.  Is your mom with you this week?  
STACY LEWIS: Well, my mom was here.  She left on Monday.  My husband is coming in tonight.  I wanted to just kind of see how was it by myself for a couple days, and she chose to have her worst night in months right after my mom leaves.   
But, I mean, it's really actually been okay.  The lady at day care, she said if that happens again you better call me and she would help me at night if I was by myself.  So I wanted to see how was it.  It's really been okay.  If I do have to do it down the read road, we'll be okay.   
 Q.  Good Gerrod be here the whole week?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, he's staying until next Tuesday, and then the plan is right now to be by myself again next week.  Just depends how these next couple nights go more than anything.   
If we only keep sleeping five or six hours a night I'm going to need some help.  I can only do that so many nights.   
 Q.  So this is a test?  
STACY LEWIS: It is a test.  Everything is a test with a baby.   
 Q.  Were you feeling fatigue at all with the lack of sleep out there?  
STACY LEWIS: A little bit.  We actually had to go to the UCLA Medical Center because she'd had an ear infection and was still fussy.  Ear infection is gone and she's fine, but I didn't get back until 8:00 last night.   
Get her in bed and myself in bed and then -- just say 8:00 am this morning came really fast.  I haven't had time to really feel tired.   
Be nice to have this afternoon.   
 Q.  So it seems like three hours sleep is the secret to shooting 65.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I don't know.  I was think ing out there that there has been weeks where I've been crazy busy with sponsor stuff and things in the past and I've played great.   
Maybe there is something about getting too much sleep and maybe you play worse.  I don't know.  But we're not going to continue the trend of no sleep; we're going to go the other way hopefully.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the par-3, the finishing hole?  It wasn't the finishing hole for you today, but I talked to you a little bit about that when you went through.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  It does seem like a par-3 where there could be, on Sunday, a two-stroke swing.  
STACY LEWIS: For sure.  Yeah, a lot can happen on that little green.  It's so small.  It's just a cool scene setting.  You can get so many people up here watching and people in the stands.  It's almost a more fun finishing hole I think for the fans.   
Definitely our 17, I mean, definitely looks more like the 18th hole.  I like it just from a fan aspect of being able to see it.   
 Q.  Is it comfortable standing on the tee?  I know it's not a comfortable tee shot for the members, but for you guys, the fact that it's only six paces wide there at the waist, does that...  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it's a little nerve wracking.  Just kind of depends on hole location.  You really just try to hit it to the middle of each section of the green, and if you make the putt, great.   
There are just certain places that you can't miss it.  Like long and left.  You can't be there.  You got to be short of all those back pins.  There are just certain places you can't be.   
 Q.  On 18 you had a three-footer fracture for par there?  
STACY LEWIS: It was probably more four or five.  It lipped out and went further away.   
 Q.  I'm sorry, on your 18th, so 9.  
STACY LEWIS: Oh, that last hole?  Yeah, that was probably about five feet.   
 Q.  That is an easy putt to 3-putt, isn't it?  
STACY LEWIS: Oh, I mean, I played almost a cup of break.  It had a ton of break.   
 Q.  Looked like you were very happy that that one went in.  
STACY LEWIS: Yes.  I did not want to end the day with a 3-putt.
