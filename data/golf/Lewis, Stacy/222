  THE MODERATOR:   We're here with Stacy Lewis, Rolex Rankings No.2, native Texan.   Talk about what it means to be back in Texas for this tournament. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I'm excited to be back.   This is a week where I get to enjoy my family and get to have some friends around, definitely play in some weather and at a golf course that I'm used to the style of it.   But more than that I think it's nice to be back a little bit closer to home.
THE MODERATOR:   You mentioned the family around.   You have a couple nieces and nephews coming out.   Who else is coming out from the Lewis family? 
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I've got my parents, of course, and then my sister and little niece and nephew.   My nephew is getting old enough that he's kind of starting to figure things out, so hopefully he behaves and doesn't make too much of a scene. 
THE MODERATOR:   Going back to the Texas thing, I know you were at the Rangers game on Sunday.   The Stanford‑Lang‑Piller Classic Presented by Lewis and Futcher, what do you think about that? 
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know about that.   You know, we have fun.   The baseball game was a lot of fun.   Just coming off of last week, it was nice to just be able to relax a little bit, and the game wasn't all that great, I guess, if you're a Rangers fan.   But it was fun to just hang out and just, again, try to take my mind off of the golf and get ready for this week. 
THE MODERATOR:   Angela threw out the first pitch at that event.   What did you think of her form? 
STACY LEWIS:   She did pretty good.   I think this was her third or fourth time doing it, so I would think she would get better at it as time goes on. 
THE MODERATOR:   And then another thing about the North Texas Shootout that's unique to this event is they have the two qualifiers for the two high school girls in the field, two college girls.   I know you're a big fan of growing the sport of golf especially among the younger generations.   Can you talk about what that is and what it means for those girls? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, you know, it's one of the things I love about this tournament is the fact that we get the younger girls in here and give them a chance to learn a little bit, to play, to play with the pros.   That's something that I got to do in college that I think really helped me a lot coming out here, kind of knowing what to expect and also knowing where my game stood and where I could improve. 
You know, I like that we get to be around the kids a little bit and have some fun.
THE MODERATOR:   Do you have any advice for them? 
STACY LEWIS:   Just for this week, just to really watch the other players, and that's something I even try to do is to watch the people you play with and see what they do that makes them‑‑ whether it's a great putter, great driver of the ball, whatever it is, see what makes them great, and try to take little pieces of everybody's game. 

Q.   Style‑wise does this course set up for a certain type of golfer? 
STACY LEWIS:   You know, I think this course requires just a lot of strategic play.   There's a couple goofy tee shots where you've got to kind of be careful with.   But the greens this year are in much better shape.   They're a lot more receptive.   You're going to get rewarded more for good shots.   So that's one thing I'm excited about this year.   The course is definitely more green, which is nice. 
You know, I think length is always an advantage, especially on the par‑5s here, but at the same time there's holes you've got to kind of reel it back in and hit a little bit less off the tee. 

Q.   When you come off a week like last week where you had a chance on the last day if you make some putts to do something, does that drive you more, and how do you take last week into the next week, or do you have to forget about it and try to start over? 
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I can tell you that, the old saying the more you do things, the easier it gets, I can tell you that finishing second doesn't get any easier.   You know, I didn't get a lot of sleep on Sunday and Monday.   You sit there and you think about all the shots, what you could have done different, you could have done this or that.   It's really hard to come off a week like last week where I had a chance to win, but I'm not the kind of person that's going to lay around and feel sorry for myself.   I came out and got right back to work. 
I mean, my game is in a great place.   I've got to get my mind back centered on what I'm doing.   I'm playing good golf.   I'm excited that we get to kind of keep going and keep playing, but it definitely takes a couple days to come off of something like that, like what happened last week. 

Q.   You talked about the young players a minute ago, the high school players.   The youth on Tour right now, talk about what you see that's doing to the game right now, the fact that the players that are young are the ones that are having quite an impact right now. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's pretty amazing really to think like what Lydia and Lexi are doing at such a young age.   I was never close to what they're doing at that age.   More than anything it creates good story lines.   It creates exposure for the Tour.   It draws attention.   If somebody is 26, 27 doing what Lydia is doing, it's a little different story than if you're 17.   It creates those story lines, gets people talking, and that's the best thing about what's going on right now is the LPGA is kind of moving in the right direction as far as tournaments, and now you've got some great players playing some really good golf, and that just helps our momentum. 

Q.   Can you address this event, how it went last year and what you think of the course, stuff like that? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, you know, last year I thought for the first year of a tournament, the turnout, just with the crowds, was unbelievable.   I remember it was either Saturday or Sunday just the ropes from the 18th tee all the way to the clubhouse were just lined with kids, and that was the coolest thing.   I've never seen that at any other tournament, just all the kids that came out, because the more we get into the markets where junior golf is big, that's where we need those junior players to be playing good golf. 
The fact that we're here and we're back again is a great thing.   I hope we're coming back next year.   I know we've got some work to make that happen.   But I think this is a place that we need to be playing. 

Q.   Going back to the question previously about the young players on Tour, talk about the expanded growth this year of the Tour and adding two or three more tournaments.   Do you think that kind of goes hand in hand? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, I think the more playing opportunities you have, for sure you get into more of a rhythm.   But the Tour this year, I mean, we're adding tournaments, we're adding sponsors, increases in social media and media hits.   I mean, you can feel it amongst the Tour.   You can feel the momentum going. 
I don't know, it's hard to say whether getting more tournaments has led to better play, but it's just good timing, I guess, for everything.   I don't know, I think we maybe could have used this a few years ago, but I think now we kind of have a really solid base of over 30 events.   Now you get some stars playing well, you start increasing purses, you start getting on network TV, things like that, and then the Tour just kind of keeps growing from there.
