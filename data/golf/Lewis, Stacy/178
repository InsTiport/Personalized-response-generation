Q.   Tough start.   One of those days after that? 
STACY LEWIS:   Well, first hole I hit pretty good golf shots.   Just unfortunately got short‑sided over the back of the green and made bogey.
The ball striking just wasn't there all day.   We didn't judge the wind very good either.   Seemed to be coming up short and long.   Just didn't judge the wind good like we did yesterday.
But fortunately I made a bunch of really good pars on the back nine especially.   Only hitting six greens and 2‑over in these conditions is pretty good.

Q.   It's a little early to try to take something positive out of this, but probably about as bad as you could have played and you're six shots back. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I kept looking at the leaderboard and the leaders weren't going anywhere.   I told myself if I could just get in under par for two rounds, you're not out of this. 
We're going to have this wind the next two days.   If I can just figure out how to control my shots a little better I'll be there.
The short game is obviously there.   I made some great up and downs coming in.   It's not far off.   It's just a few little things here and there.

Q.   Had you seen your wedge game be this good up to this week, or just something that clicked? 
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   I mean, I'm used to chipping off this grass being in Florida.   Practicing in Florida I'm used to having the kind of grainy chips around the greens.
I made some really great up and downs.
I like the sane in the bunkers. 
I'm really comfortable around the greens. 
I'd just like to be on the greens a little bit more. 

Q.   Is it relieving not to lose any shots to Inbee today even after a tough round?
STACY LEWIS:   Well, that's good to know.   I had no idea. 

Q.   She's at 1‑over. 
STACY LEWIS:   That's good.   I guess that's what everybody is kind of following.   I would've liked to have been closer to the lead.   That's the big thing.   I wanted to be within a couple of lead going into the weekend.
Six back is not a horrible position.   I don't think anybody is running away with this thing.   I think it's going to end up being pretty bunched up at the end and probably a playoff on Sunday.
I'm right where I need to be.   Trying not to think about Player of the Year and all that stuff.   It's up there, but trying not to think about it.

Q.   According to the Weather Channel it's going to warm up, but it's going to be this windy the rest of the weekend.   Is that good for you? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think if you're coming from behind you want it to be windy.   The leaders probably don't want it windy, but I do.
The warmer will help.   The ball should be flying further.   The golf course today played really long on the back nine.   I want the wind.

Q.   Is it a little bit of a disadvantage having a late tee time today?   Seemed like it got more windy as the day went on.
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it did.   I think it got cold when we were on 9, and then when we made the turn out there on 13 and got out into the open it really got windy on us. 
Yeah, it probably was a little bit of a disadvantage.   If you look at some of the low scores, they were off early today. 

Q.   Michelle said the wind out here is hard to judge.   It's really swirling.   Is that the case for you, too?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't think it's swirling, I just think it's hard to judge whether ‑‑ you know, downwind sometimes just knocks it down instead of carrying it. 
You get an into‑the‑wind crosswind and if you get the ball turning too much it just doesn't knock it down.   I mean, there so many factors you have to get right, because a lot of these holes are crosswinds.   They're not straight down.

Q.   How big was it to make that on 17?   I'm sure you weren't happy with your drive and then turned around after you hit your shot. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, 17 was nice.   I've been chipping well all week.   I knew I was due for one to go in.   Fortunately it was perfect to chip that one in.   The putt on 18 was probably more important just for my own psyche.   I think I feel a little bit better making that putt.
