 Q.   Well, run us through the round, very solid, once again?     
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I mean it was just a really solid day.   Again, hit the ball really good like I did yesterday, and just the greens were so much better this morning.   I mean it was a couple of shots difference, I think, playing in the morning versus the afternoon.   And just played a little bit smarter, got on the right side of holes and just hit a lot of good shots.  
   
 Q.   What happened on the bogey?  
STACY LEWIS:   I got on the wrong side of the hole and was too aggressive with the first putt, basically.   When you hit these greens, you gotta hit them in the right spots, and then if you do miss it in the wrong spots, you just gotta be careful, and I let one get away, but I think it helped me after that.   Got my speed better after that.  
   
 Q.   After last week you said your putter was a little "eh," and then everyone said the greens are very tricky.   Is that more just reading greens here?  
STACY LEWIS:   It's a combination.   The greens are really steep, so the downhill putts are really fast and they're breaking a lot, and then later in the day they get pretty spiked up.   You get a lot of footprints.   So it's just predicting which way it's going to bounce in the afternoons, but this morning they were perfect and it was nice to hit some putts on line and see them go in.   It was a good confidence builder.  
   
 Q.   Dori turned in a low number, but numbers overall it's not like last week, and I know you say it's good for the tour to have birdie fests, but you like to grind out on tough courses.   Do you think that's something that's going to benefit you this week?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I was surprised actually to see the number she shot.   It's very impressive.   You know, it's a hard golf course.   You can make a double pretty quick, so it's a hard golf course, and I mean I like that.   That's why I love the majors.   I love the hard test where you gotta‑‑ you know, certain holes you take your par and run and then other holes you can make some birdies on.  
   
 Q.   Someone going that well early out or Justine today, put a thought in anybody's head when you think, oh, that may have to be something we have to do on the weekend?   Does that change your mentality?  
STACY LEWIS:   I know she started on the front and so she got off to a really good start, so I knew‑‑ we started on the back, so making the turn I knew I could make some birdies on the front nine, so just kind of stayed patient because the back nine always plays tough here.   So just tried to stay patient on the back nine and made a couple of longer putts and then got to the front where you can really make some birdies.  
   
 Q.   Did you have your Omega thing this week?   Was that earlier this week or was that last week?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   Monday, Tuesday.  
   
 Q.   What was going on there?  
STACY LEWIS:   Monday night at the Omega Boutique at the Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego we had a little deal for a couple of hours where Omega brought in some clients and did kind of a little meet and greet there.   And then Tuesday morning I did a clinic with about probably 50 women, and I did a clinic, met with them for a couple of hours and then they went out and played but I came here to practice.  
   
 Q.   Where was that at?  
STACY LEWIS:   The Grand Del Mar, just south of here.  
   
 Q.   And who was that?   Was that through Omega?  
STACY LEWIS:   It was through omega, yeah.   It was just all women, just trying to get more women playing golf.   It's kind of what I do with a lot of my sponsors is just getting more female executives playing.  
   
 Q.   So were they omega execs or were they just women who sought out to come out and come play?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   Some were omega.   Some were people from the Grand Del Mar.   It was a little bit of a mix.  
   
 Q.   Are you a fan of enlarging the holes to maybe make it funner?  
STACY LEWIS:   Make it easier.  
   
 Q.   Make it easier, more interesting?  
STACY LEWIS:   No.   I don't think so.   I think it's gotta start with golf course design.   I think golf courses now are getting too tricky, too goofy, where it's good for us.   You know, it makes it hard for us, but for the average player they don't need to be doing that.   They don't need to be playing these goofy golf courses, so I think it's gotta start with that, the setup and making sure people are playing the right tees.  
   
 Q.   And then also, how do you go about getting women to play golf?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's more just trying to get them to feel comfortable, comfortable playing with men and being out there and realizing most male amateur golfers aren't that good, and women just are very self conscious of not being good.   And so it's just trying to get them more comfortable.   You know, I do a lot of instruction trying to just teach them how to play so they just feel more comfortable there.  
   
 Q.   And on this golf course, the course strategy wise, I know it's kind of tough, you don't want to get in the wrong spot, want to stay below the hole.   But would you say it pays to play aggressively out here, like do fire at pins, because I was just thinking maybe if you're 30 feet away you can have a much tougher putt than if you're 10 feet away.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   It's certain holes.   I think if you've got a wedge in your hand, yeah, you can go for it.   This year versus last year the greens are a lot softer, so it's more predictable what the ball is going to do.   So you can actually hit it where you're trying to.   But it just depends on the hole.   18 you're trying to leave it short of all day.   So it's just certain holes and depends what club you have in your hand.  
   
 Q.   Just picking your spot?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   Picking your spot.
