Q. Conditions today, got a course record today, some low scores.  62; seven straight birdies.
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.
Q. This isn't that easy of a course.
STACY LEWIS: No.
Q. Was it tee set up partly like with 16?  What were the other conditions that made it...
STACY LEWIS: Moved the tee up on 8, the par-5, and then 16 was up.
The golf course was a lot softer than I thought it was going to be.  I think with the heat they probably threw some water on it.  I felt the greens -- they stayed receptive all day long.  I felt like it played pretty fair.
I played late on Thursday and they get really firm.  I thought the golf course played more fair.  I think it's good to see birdies.  You don't want to see us struggling.
The rough isn't as long as years past, so that's properly why you saw the course record more than anything.
Q. Which is interesting, because we had more rain this winter.
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I don't know.  I like it this way just because it's more fun to play and you can make birdies, but you're still going to make some bogeys.
It's a lot more fun to play this way.
Q. You had your own string of birdies.
STACY LEWIS: Uh-huh.
Q. How was that?
STACY LEWIS: It was good.  I felt like I played really solid today.  There were two drives I hit left that kind of cost me, but just hit a lot of good shots.
Really excited with the way I'm playing, especially going into next week.
