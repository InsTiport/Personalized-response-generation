Q.   I know it's not the result that you wanted but you have to be pretty proud of how you played out there today?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I am.   I played great.   I really got off to a really good start, and just the middle of the round, didn't quite make the putts that I needed to.   Just I hung in there all day and just made Inbee work for it.   That was the goal, and you give Inbee four shots, it's a tough task to overcome, and you know, she hit the shots when she needed to coming in.

Q.   How important was that hot start with three birdies in the first three holes?
STACY LEWIS:   Well, it was huge.   You would think you would pick up a shot or two but I didn't really pick up many shots there.   But obviously Inbee making those putts, I knew I needed to do something, as well.   I was fortunate I got off to a good start, but in the conditions all day, it was hard and you just had to hang in there.

Q.   We talked a couple days about how you and Inbee never really seemed to be playing at your best when you're 1,2.   This week seemed like it was a sign of things to come?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I don't think this is the last time we're battling at the end of a tournament.   I think we're both playing some really good golf right now, and it's unfortunate I guess for the fans, it's the end of the season, but we have a few tournaments left and hopefully we'll do it again.

Q.   Finally, speaking of the last three tournaments you have left, how much momentum does a secondâ€‘place finish give you going into those?
STACY LEWIS:   Well, it's huge.   More than anything, I did a lot of really good things this week.   Four rounds in the 60s, and I played really well when the pressure was on and when it was hard.   I did a lot of really good things and that's what I'm happy about.   Excited to go to Japan next week, a golf course I've won on and a place that I feel really comfortable.
