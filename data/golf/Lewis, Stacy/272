  STACY LEWIS:   So when I'm not up there on the leaderboard, it frustrates me. 
So it doesn't really change it playing here.   It's great to have family and friends here, but doesn't really change my mentality.

Q.   Is there an adjustment you see that you'll make for tomorrow?
STACY LEWIS:   I'm just going to go do some work on the range and putt a little bit.   I need to clean up my rounds.   Making too many bogeys.   That's kind of the big thing.
I feel like I'm doing some good things.   It's just couple little thing here and there.

Q.   Is there anything you can maybe peg on this golf course ‑‑ you've played great so many places and haven't quite reached that level here.   Overtime, is there maybe a common thread here?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   I think these greens are tricky, and I haven't putted these greens well over the years.   You would think after you play them a bunch you would learn them a little better.   I just haven't quite putted them well.
I've been driving it straighter so I've given myself chances; just haven't made any putts.

Q.   (Indiscernible.)
STACY LEWIS:   It's really not.   I've been doing it now for so many years.   It's kind of become old hat.   I don't know, you're just doing it every year.   It doesn't really change.
I put more pressure on myself to be up on the leaderboard than worrying about who is here watching.
