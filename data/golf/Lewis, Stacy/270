 Q.   Given the conditions this afternoon, how happy are you with that round of level par?  
STACY LEWIS:   I would have liked to have gotten one there at the end.   I had two good chances on 17 and 18.   But overall, it was playing so hard out there.   It was just a grind.   You had to make‑‑ at least I had to make a bunch of 4‑ or 5‑footers for par, and even par on a day like this when it's windy is a good score.  
   
 Q.   You talked about your Curtis Cup experience here and experiencing so many facets of this golf course, but had you gone through 32‑mile‑an‑hour a winds back then?  
STACY LEWIS:   We had a little bit of wind.   I don't remember it being quite that much.   I think holes 11 through 17, I had 4‑ or 5‑iron into every single hole, so it was so long.   You really just had to make some good two putts, and it was definitely playing hard.  
   
 Q.   You've had a good season by anybody's standard, two wins, you've reached No. 1 in the world, but you've been relatively quiet in the Majors‑‑ puzzling, I'm sure, for you.   But what's clicking this week compared to other Majors this year?  
STACY LEWIS:   I think I'm just putting a little better.   I'm making those key putts and making some birdies, a couple longer putts here and there.   I was looking forward to this one.   
I love this golf course, so I think I knew I'd play a little bit better here.   I don't know why the other Majors were the way they were, but I'm just glad I'm playing good here.
