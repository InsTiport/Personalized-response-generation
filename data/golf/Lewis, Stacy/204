Q.   You seem pretty jovial after an opening 71.   Are you happy with the day?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think anything under par on this golf course is a good score.   It definitely could have been better.   Didn't hit the ball great today.   But managed to get the ball in the hole and posted a red number, which is good.

Q.   You said earlier in the week that you have to pace yourself around this golf course.   Did you do that today? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I did, because I think that those opening few holes are hard, and I figure you're going to make a bogey or two in them and I was 2‑over through three or four holes.   I knew I needed to stay patient and just keep hanging in there and I did that and was able to make quite a few birdies, even given the conditions weren't probably, but they were still pretty tough out there.

Q.   If you're looking at the round, think of 14 in the bunker and then 17 in the thick rough, seems as though you survived pretty well. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, Travis and I were talking, when you get in trouble, you've got to get out.   You can't compound mistakes.   You can come back from a bogey.   Doubles are just hard to come back from.   Was able to, I stole a couple birdies out there, stole a couple pars, which is good.   It was a good day. 

Q.   On Tuesday you said if it rains this week, I'd love it.   Does that mean you're disappointed today? 
STACY LEWIS:   No, I'm not disappointed.   This golf course is so hard, I couldn't imagine four days of this much rough and all the wind and everything it entails.   It's nice to have it pretty calm today.   I think it's going to get‑‑ Sunday looks like we have some worse weather, which I would love to see on Sunday.   So you know, it was nice though to play the golf course the way it should be played instead of a whipping wind.
