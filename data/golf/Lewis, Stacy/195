 Q.   Are you happy with the way you played?  
STACY LEWIS:   Well, the last two days, I really, I played a lot better.   And more than anything I just wanted to play 16, 17 and 18 well.   I kind of struggled on them all week, and it was just nice to finish off a good day.  
   
 Q.   Four birdies in a five‑hole span.   Did you just simply run out of time?  
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   I think I just got my act together a little bit.   Just I've been struggling with my game and I've been trying to work on things.  
I feel like yesterday I hit the ball a lot better, so I was excited about coming in today.   I felt like you could make some birdies on the Back 9 there, especially the way the par‑5s were playing.   So just happy that I did.  
   
 Q.   What did you hear from the galleries today?  
STACY LEWIS:   You know, all week everybody's‑‑ you know, they've been so supportive for so long, and everybody is sad that we're leaving, but I think we'll be back here in a few years.   You know, these crowds today just show that we should be playing here, and I think we'll be back.
