  Q. How did you manage that -1 on the golf course today?   
 STACY LEWIS: Well, I got some good bounces. I holed out for eagle on the par-5. Just kind of things started to go my way at the end, and I started to hit some better golf shots.  
  
  Q. What did you do on 9? Was it 9?  
 STACY LEWIS: No, I holed out on 4.  
  
  Q. On 4?   
 STACY LEWIS: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. How far away and what club?   
 STACY LEWIS: Actually 160, and I hit 6-iron. They said it just went in like a putt. So it just kind of got things moving the right direction, and then a made great putt on the last hole.  
  
  Q. Your mindset today was what going in?  
 STACY LEWIS: Um, I mean, I knew I was in okay shape. I mean, I was pressured the way I played, but I made two great pars finishing yesterday.   
 And so that was kind of some good momentum that I had going into the day. And I didn't even practice much. I just wanted to think about those good things I did and come into today like it was a new day.  
  
  Q. It's unusual when -1 is one of the better scores of the day. What does that say about how tough this golf course is?  
 STACY LEWIS: This golf course is showing its teeth I think today, and I think it's going to. The wind is starting to blow. Some of the par-3s are playing a little tougher today, I think, so I think that's gonna move me up a lot by the end of the day.
