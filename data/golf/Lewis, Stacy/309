  MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome our current leader, Stacy Lewis, into the interview room.   Congratulations.   63 ties the tournament record, which was set by Helen Alfredsson back in the second round in 2008.   What a string you went on with those seven straight birdies.   
Thoughts overall on the round and take me through that string of birdies and what was going through your mind during that stretch.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, you know I kind of got off to a slow start.   Didn't really have anything going the first few holes.  
I don't know what changed or what clicked, but I think the pretty close on 5 and made a long putt on 6; barely missed eagle on 7.   
From there I started to hit some good shots.   Made about a 20‑footer on 11, which is the last of the seven.  
So, I mean, it was just one of those days where you just get in this rhythm where you're just hitting golf shots and not thinking about a score or trying to make birdie.   It's just playing golf.  
I was happy, more happy to finish with the two birdies than even the seven just to get some momentum going into tomorrow.  
MODERATOR:   When you're on such a hot streak like that, are you aware of how many you have in a row?   Are thinking about it?   Is it your group say anything to you?   
STACY LEWIS:   After about the fifth one we started talking about it a little bit.   T.J., Brittany's caddie, just said, Are you going to birdie every hole?   I said, Well, why not?   That's what we're out here to do, right?   
So we started talking about it 6 and 7.   I barely missed my birdie putt for the eighth in a row, and Paula goes, Well seven is pretty good.   
I mean, it was just one of those days where stuff just starts going your way and you make a few putts.  
   
 Q.   Last you're you finished runner‑up here.   You seem to like this golf course.   What is it about it that suits your game?   I know there have been some slight changes to the course already this year.   How is that affecting play out there?  
STACY LEWIS:   I don't think it's really changed anything the way the course plays.   Playing well on this course is all putting well and making birdies.   I think every year I've learn the greens better and better, and that's the key.   I'm playing good golf.   
I love coming here.   It's so relaxing to come here.   The hotels are great and they take care of us so well that it's such an easy week.  
I don't know, can't help but put you in a good mood and makes you play some good golf.  
   
 Q.   Have you had a run like that before?   
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know for sure.   I know I made six in a row before, but I don't think I've done seven.  
   
 Q.   Because you've had a lot of streaks.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I usually make birdies in kind of streaks.   Usually make two or three at a time.   I don't know why I do that, but I kind of get some momentum going.   
I definitely think this is one of the lowest rounds I've ever shot.   I don't know 100% on that.   
   
 Q.   That was going to be my next question:   Is this your best round ever?  
STACY LEWIS:   I think it is.   I don't know 100%.   
MODERATOR:   We'll check on that.  
   
 Q.   I'm not trying to push you.   
STACY LEWIS:   I honestly have no idea.  
   
 Q.   Do you never think as the rest of us think, you know, I've made three birdies and things are going to go wrong now?  
STACY LEWIS:   Not really.   I think it's more because on this course so many under par usually wins every year that the moment you stop thinking about making a birdie or hitting a good shot, that's when you do.  
You just know in the back of your mind you have to make birdies and you have to keep hitting good shots.   What's done is done, and just keep trying to do what you're doing.   
   
 Q.   So you made eight in a row you say.   
STACY LEWIS:   Made seven.  
   
 Q.   Seven.   So what was your thinking when you tee'd up at the next then?   Do you forget the ones that have gone before?  
STACY LEWIS:   I definitely know that I made seven birdies in a row.   You definitely know you've done that.   
But, I mean, you still have to hit the golf shot at hand.   It's hard to not think about that.   You play a little defensive.   But my birdie putt on the next one went right over the edge.   I did everything I could to keep it going, but...  
I mean, you try not to get ahead of yourself and think back too much about your round either.   Just stay in the moment, and that's what I did today.  
MODERATOR:   You've been on such a hot streak this year in terms of your play.   We were joking in the media room that it's not surprising to see you get on a run in a round.   Overall when you look at this year and how well you've been playing, do the rounds just seem to come naturally right now to shoot low?   Just feeling very comfortable with your game?   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I feel really good with my game.   Coming of the U.S. Open I was really disappointed with the way I played there.   I went back and worked hard these last couple weeks just mentally getting in a better place.  
I got really upset with myself and got ahead of myself at the Open and just really wasn't working on my game the way I should've.   I was really disappointed with that.  
So to come out today and follow that up with a really good round, I think it does a lot for my confidence.   
   
 Q.   As a follow up on that, what else have you done this year that has really given you this super momentum?   You're just everywhere and doing really well, which is great.   
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   That's what everybody asks me.   I don't feel like I'm doing anything different.   I think a lot of it is being comfortable making five birdies in a row and going ahead and making two more.  
You know, I think probably this time last year I would get on the leaderboard and be unsure and start protecting the lead or something like that.   
I'm comfortable there.   I'm fine with seeing my name up there and playing in those final groups.   I think that's what really kind of changed things for me this year.  
   
 Q.   There's no technical changes or anything you've gone through?   
STACY LEWIS:   No.   I mean, over the last couple years I've been working on the same things with my swing.   It's kind of a gradual getting it into better position.  
It's really been all confidence for me.   My putter is all confidence.   If I feel good over it, I'm going to make the putt.   If your confidence is high, I think I can make a lot of putts.   
   
 Q.   You sure did today.   Keep them up.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, thanks.
