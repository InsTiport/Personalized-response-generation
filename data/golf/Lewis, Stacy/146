  STACY LEWIS:   It was pretty terrible up until that last hole.   Just hit the ball bad, putted bad.   Just didn't really get anything going.

Q.   How much does that last hole sort of give you some good momentum going into tomorrow?
STACY LEWIS:   It's nice to just kind of‑‑ it makes a bad round be a little bit better, which is what you need to do, you know.   You need to make your bad rounds not as bad.   So just got me a little bit closer.   I mean scores aren't going crazy.   The golf course is playing tough enough that you post a number tomorrow and I'll be right in it.

Q.   How difficult is it to stay reasonably patient in those kind of conditions with the wind?   I said reasonably. 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean you have to.   There's some holes out there that are playing really tough, and the wind is completely opposite of what we normally have on this golf course.   So holes that normally play easy were playing pretty hard today.   So you have to go in there with a different mindset.

Q.   How did you feel about your putting today?
STACY LEWIS:   I mean I should have made some more putts.   I definitely had a couple of 3‑putts, but that was more caused by where I left them. 
Didn't putt great, didn't hit it well and that's kind of what happens.

Q.   Gotta feel pretty good that no one ran away with it so far today, though; right?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean the golf course is hard, but with that said, it's going to be hard to shoot a low number just because of the way it's playing.   I mean I've done it before on this golf course, so you know, we'll see what happens tomorrow afternoon.
