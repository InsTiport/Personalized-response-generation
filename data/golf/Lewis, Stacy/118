 Q. Even par out there today. What was the round like?   
STACY LEWIS: Just wasn't very good. Didn't really hit the ball very solid and never gave myself a lot of good birdie chances. Just didn't play very well.  
   
 Q. Having said that, you are still only six back on a course that plays pretty tough that you have some experience at?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I've got to play some better golf. I've got to hit the ball better. Not really think about the lead, just need to play some better golf.  
   
 Q. What are you going to go to work on?   
STACY LEWIS: I've just got to go on the range and work on some stuff, hitting the ball more solid.  
   
 Q. And then going into the weekend, what's the approach? What's the mindset after you get your stuff worked on?  
STACY LEWIS: Just play better golf right now. That's all it is.
