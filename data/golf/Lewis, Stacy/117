  THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome in Stacy Lewis into the interview room. 5‑under, 67 today, low round in the clubhouse so far. Not a lot of low scores today. I know some of the tees are probably back a little bit. What was the key for today?   
STACY LEWIS: For me, I just made more putts. I didn't really hit it that much better than I have the last couple of days. Just finally got the putter going on the back nine and made a nice putt for par on 9. That really just kind of got things going from there.  
   
 Q. Waking up today, have a bit of sense of urgency for moving day or business as usual?   
STACY LEWIS: Urgency to get done, urgency to beat the storms and all that. But just really to play‑‑ to put a better score up.   
I didn't really play that bad the last two days. Just hadn't put the numbers together. I just really wanted to put a good number up and give myself a chance for tomorrow. It's going to take a low one, but at least I have a chance.  
   
 Q. Why is it on Saturday you play so well?  
STACY LEWIS: I have no idea. I don't know. I mean, I guess you want to play on a Saturday than Thursday or Friday. But I don't know.   
   
 Q. The leader is still not done, but what do you think is a realistic deficit going into tomorrow for you?  
STACY LEWIS: If I'm 5 or 6 back, I think I've got a chance, especially if we get weather and get some delays and things get tough. If somebody can post a low number, we'll see what happens. It's always better on these greens to get out ahead and not be in those last groups. They're a little less bumpy early on. If the weather gets bad tomorrow, I can post a number and just see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Stacked leaderboard. A lot of big names. Any specific reason why, you think? Is that a good thing for you tomorrow, somebody who likes to be challenged a little bit?   
STACY LEWIS: One, I think it's great for the Tour. I think you've got a big purse. Everybody is showing up, everybody is ready to play. It's going to be great TV and theater. That's what you want at the end of year.   
This golf course is hard. You got to hit it good. You've got to hit some good quality shots, long irons into a lot of these par‑4s. So I think that's the reason why you are seeing such a good leaderboard more than anything.  
   
 Q. There is fairly realistic scenario where you can win second here and win the Race to the CME Globe with all these second place finishes. Kind of emblematic of your year, but would you trade that for one or two wins?  
STACY LEWIS: It would be a really nice bonus. I don't know. That's a tough one. I would love to win. I don't know the scenarios. I knew if I could keep close to Inbee and Lydia and maybe beat them by a couple of shots, I could sneak up there and win a little bit of cash at the end of the year. That was honestly my goal more than anything coming in today, to get a little bit closer to Inbee and Lydia to give myself a chance to have a little bonus money to walk away with.  
THE MODERATOR: I know you are a numbers person. You can check the spreadsheet.  
STACY LEWIS: I don't want to know.  
   
 Q. I know you made a lot of putts. Was the par putt on 9 as important as any of the putts you made? You were only 1‑under at the time?  
STACY LEWIS: I hit a bad shot into 9 and made‑‑ that was a slider, too. It was about a 10‑foot slider that probably had the most break of any putt I've had this week. That putt was huge.   
I just got things going, and the par on 17, honestly, I think just makes this day a lot better. Makes things easier to leave the golf course today happier and some momentum going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q. Just generally, what do you think of the whole CME Globe Race? Does it work? Do you like it?   
STACY LEWIS: I love the Globe Race. I love the drama that it creates. It gives some people, media and TV, gives everybody something to talk about. That's what we need with our Tour.   
I do wish more than three people were paid. I think more than three should get paid. But we'll get there hopefully down the road.  
   
 Q. It was hard to tell on TV, was that your drive or second shot into the trees on 17?  
STACY LEWIS: The drive was in the trees, the second shot was off the pine straw and then I finally got back to the fairway and then I almost holed my chip shot.  
   
 Q. How far were you?   
STACY LEWIS: I was 48yards and hit, almost made it.  
THE MODERATOR: Great job today. Good luck tomorrow.
