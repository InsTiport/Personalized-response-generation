Q. How do you feel about your first round today?  You've got three more to go.
STACY LEWIS:   It was a good start.  I felt like the putter was a little bit hit or miss today.  It was really good at times and bad at others, but overall pretty happy.  I thought it played really tough out there this afternoon, just I watched some shots this morning, the way they were landing, and it was a lot firmer this afternoon.
Q. Speaking of the afternoon, you played later today.  How were the conditions today?  Were they as bad as you expected or thought?
STACY LEWIS:   It was pretty similar to -- I played yesterday afternoon, as well, in practice, and it was pretty similar to that as far as just the front nine, it was just hard to hold any greens.  You're hitting long clubs and then the greens are just very firm.  So it played tough, and hopefully get out there tomorrow morning and get a few close looks at it.
Q. What are you going to do tonight to relax?
STACY LEWIS:   Have dinner, put the baby to bed, get her in the bath at a decent time, and we'll putt a little bit here, but get out of here and rest.
Q. Focus on the next three rounds?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, yeah focus on tomorrow and kind of what -- keep hitting fairways, keep hitting greens, and if I can just putt a little bit better, the game is where it needs to be.
