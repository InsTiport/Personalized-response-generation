 Q. Obviously wasn't the finish you wanted in the second round. 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. 

 Q. You're still sitting, you know, close to the top. 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed with the way I played the last five or six holes. It was playing hard. I just didn't hit any fairways. 
 My caddie told me, he's like, You're in it; we still got two more days. Well, two more rounds. Who knows how many more days it will be. But we got two more rounds, and you're still right there. 

 Q. That had to be one of the craziest rounds of your life, 14 hours, I think. 
 STACY LEWIS: Uh-huh, yeah.

 Q. How would you sum it up?
 STACY LEWIS: Exhausting. I mean, I felt awful last night. I didn't feel much better when I woke up. It was just really tiring to me. I've played 36 holes, but not on a golf course like this. 
 It was tough, and I hope the second wave gets what we did today.

 Q. You said it was hard on you, especially with your back situation. How were you this morning?
 STACY LEWIS: It was better than I felt last night, for sure. Still kinda sore, but I've got some time to work on it and get it loosened it up. 
 Playing 36 holes and sitting on the bus for an hour isn't good for my back.

 Q. U.S. Opens are exasperating. Does this compound what you guys are going through?
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it's hard enough to play the golf course 18 holes. You're having just to keep that focus -- we were out on the golf course for almost 12 hours. To keep that focus that long is tough.
