Q. How important was it for you to come out and make a statement early?
STACY LEWIS: It was huge.  I wanted to get a lead early and kind of put a number up there for the girls to see, but just happy to get the win and get it done a little bit early, now I'm going to go get the rest of these girls in the house.
Q. Every time Mika gave you reason to think you might get an easy one, she fought back well with a tough putt.  What were you telling yourself midway through the round?
STACY LEWIS: I was just trying to fight through it.  I wasn't hitting a lot of great shots, and I was getting up-and-down and forcing Mika to make par and found a little something in my swing on 11 and just really striped it from there on in.  I made a bunch of birdies, which usually leads to wins.
Q. How good does this feel now?
STACY LEWIS: It's awesome.  I haven't done what I wanted in Solheims on Sundays, and this is not quite as much pressure, but my team pulled me out here for a reason, to go get a point, or two points, I guess, and I'm just happy we could get two points on the board.  They're playing good behind me, so hopefully we can turn this in.
