 Q.   Very solid start from you.   A nice back nine.  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Take me through the day.   What was working super well?  
STACY LEWIS:   Well, early, you know, I hit some good shots, but had to make‑‑ my speed was kind of off on the greens, had to make some five and six footers, but actually made them, so it kind of helped get the confidence going.  
Then the back nine for me, it just sets up a lot better.   I feel like you can kind of free wheel it a little bit and still be more open and is made a few longer putts, but all day I hit the ball pretty well.  
   
 Q.   How are the greens in everyone said they slowed down almost throughout the day.   Talked to Karrie, and she said they slowed down a little bit.   Did you see that at all?  
STACY LEWIS:   I mean I don't think it was too noticeable.   I mean it kind of happens on every golf course.   I feel like the greens kind of slow down, but I definitely‑‑ early I was hitting putts too hard.   I just wasn't‑‑ I didn't have the speed well, and the front nine greens also have some more slopes in them, so I think they seem to play a little faster than they are.  
   
 Q.   What part about this course do you think most suits you where you feel super comfortable?   Is you seem very comfortable, not really out of sorts too many spots.  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   Overall, a lot of tee shots they setup well for me.   They fit me eye.   I just like a golf course you can make birdies on.   That's the key.  
If you hit good shots here, you're going to have decent chances at it, and the greens are rolling so good.   It's just nice to play a really good golf course and one you can make birdies on.   It's fun for us to play and fun for people to watch.  
   
 Q.   We like watching it.   What do you think about number wise this I guess whole week?   20s do you think will be able to‑‑  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, there's always low numbers on this golf course.   You know, today actually the pins were harder than I expected them to be on the first day.   So I expected to see a nine or 10‑under truthfully just because the way the golf course plays, but the pins kind of didn't allow for that.  
So kind of depends really what they do with the setup of the golf course, but I mean it's probably at least 20 under at the end of the week.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, I was going to say, even if they have a couple of tough pins.  
STACY LEWIS:   You got it.  
   
 Q.   Thank you very much.  
STACY LEWIS:   You're welcome.
