Q.   Great day.   I know you kind of were frustrated a little bit with the game kind of coming in, but to be able to put together a round like you did today, tell me how nice that was.
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   You know, it started out kind of like it's been for the last few days and I just got more and more comfortable with my swing throughout the day and finally hit some good shots at the end and made a few putts, so it's just nice to leave here on a good note and know that I'm working on the right things and moving in the right direction.

Q.   13, just take me through that hole.
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   It was playing about 135 today, and it was just a nice perfect 9‑iron for me and right off the face I thought I had a car and for it to get that close was kind of disappointing, but it was a great shot and that's the closest I've come to making a hole‑in‑one on tour, so hopefully I'll get one here soon.

Q.   Isn't it always funny how that is that you can be one of the most successful players out on tour and just not have those hole‑in‑ones?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I've had one hole‑in‑one in my entire life.   So golf is a crazy game.

Q.   We talked a little bit earlier about the crowds out here and how tremendous.   What does it mean to have an event here as a Texan to see this and how impressed were you by the amount of fans that were out there today?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   This weekend it's been unbelievable, especially yesterday, I played with Paula, and the amount of kids we had with our group was unbelievable.   They all had their LPGA girls golf gear on, and just to know that these kids in Texas now have somebody to come watch and somewhere ‑‑ they aspire to be out here so just to have somebody to look up to.   And I hope we can continue to come here for a few more years.

Q.   Going into the next couple weeks, like you said, feeling good about the swing now, what's the hope kind of going into the next few tournaments?   How are you feeling about the game and what will it take in terms of getting you back to where you kind of want to be?
STACY LEWIS:   You know, I think when I think back on the year I'm where I want to be and I know I'm No. 2 in the rankings, but that's not what everything's about.   I want to have good days like today and fight through kind of not so good weeks and come out with a good finish.   And I just gotta compare myself to me.   I can't compare nice to Inbee or Na Yeon Choi. 
You know, I'm excited about where my game is, though.   Coming into this summer, we got the majors coming up and got a few weeks where I'm defending or I played well, so I have some good vibes going back there.

Q.   Is it one thing too you have to put in perspective a little bit for yourself after reaching the No. 1 spot?   You have two wins already this year.   You have five Top 10s.   It's a pretty impressive stretch already just early in the year?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   I found myself after Hawaii being disappointed with a ninth place finish, when anyone's usually happy with a Top 10, so I needed to kind of take some perspective back, and I've won twice this year.   I've had five Top 10s and hopefully get another one here.   But it's been really good, and I just need to not put so much pressure on myself and just realize I'm doing a lot of good things.

Q.   How much does the Solheim Cup play on your mind?
STACY LEWIS:   It's always there.   I think especially this year.   Every time you're playing with a European player you're kind of thinking about Solheim and what it's going to be like, and it's fun to watch some of the young Americans starting to play well, and you know, I'm excited to kind of see how they do when they get to Solheim.
