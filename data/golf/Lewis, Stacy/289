 Q.   You're 1â€‘under overall?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Just tell me about the day.   
STACY LEWIS:   It wasn't very good.   I just didn't really hit it very close and didn't give myself many birdie opportunities and just kind of struggled all day.  
   
 Q.   Have you felt any added pressure coming here as No.1 to sort of perform, and if not, are you feeling like tomorrow maybe you can make a run?  
STACY LEWIS:   No pressure really.   I mean, coming into the week my swing didn't feel great and I was kind of hoping I would figure things out by now, but I just haven't.   I don't know, maybe it all comes together today, but I think the weather is perfect today, so I'm probably pretty far back.
