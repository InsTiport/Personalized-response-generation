 Q.   7‑under par, not the day you were hoping for, I'm sure.   But just talk about your day and the tournament overall.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I got off to a bad start and was struggling early and just never really got anything going.   
It was fun, though, watching Lydia play, and I kind of got caught up in her game I think there at the end watching her play, and she went around the whole day, she played great.   Every single shot was right at the pin.   Jiyai and I started laughing about it at the end, so it was just really impressive and fun to be a part of history.  
   
 Q.   You talked about it a little yesterday.   You were sort of in a position.   You were top amateur, but now that she's actually won, can you just address what you saw from her and just kind of, like you said, being part of history?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean I was most impressed with just her demeanor.   I mean you would have never known that it was the final round of an LPGA event.   She played like she had been there before.   It was an impressive round for an LPGA pro, let alone a 14‑year‑old.   So I was really impressed.   She held it together out there and I was just trying to talk to her at the end, ask her what she's doing next week and kind of keep her distracted a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Sure.   Do you feel like almost ‑‑ you're now in a position where you've been there, kind of done that, and maybe you can kind of give back in that way to her a little bit?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think you finally saw some nerves there at the end.   I think she finally realized what was going to happen and we've all been there and we know those feelings.   So I was just, what are you doing next week, is your mom here, and just kind of asking her basic questions.   And she thanked me afterwards, but it was an honor just to get to watch her, so I had to say thank you to her.  
   
 Q.   That was really one of the great ball‑striking rounds.   Like from ten on, she just striped everything, didn't she?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I think 10 through 14, I think she birdied pretty much every ‑‑ or she missed one, I think.   Jiyai and I just started laughing.   I mean you look up, every shot's at the flag and the ball goes in the hole and obviously she just had one of those days that you kind of dream of having, and the fact that she's 15 is unbelievable.  
   
 Q.   Did you have to keep reminding yourself this is a 15‑year‑old girl we're playing with?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.   You knew to talk to her, you know that she's 15.   And there were some shots out there you could tell that just kind of some experience and shelled have played them a little differently, but she got the ball in the hole and I wasn't even imagining being out here at 15, so I'm really impressed.  
   
 Q.   So at what point in your round did you say, okay, I'm not going to catch her.   
STACY LEWIS:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   But you know the prize money is still there.   Do you start thinking about those things?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, you do.   She went on that run starting on 10 through 12, 13 there.   And you definitely think about it a little bit.   You're just trying to do the best you can and I just didn't have my game today.
