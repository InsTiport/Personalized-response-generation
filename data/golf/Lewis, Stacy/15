  Q. Stacy, I know it's always a treat to come back here to the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship, but is it more special coming in two weeks after a win and having that confidence back?
 STACY LEWIS:   It is.  I mean, every opportunity I get to play right now is special because I feel like I'm playing well.  Just need rest is kind of the key.
 But I love it here.  I love this t golf course.  It's unfortunate we don't have the fans this year, but it's still special being here.
 Q. You mentioned it being special.  A special week for you also.  Monday you were reunited with your husband of course, but also Chesnee after your first win as a mom.  Walk us through that moment.
 STACY LEWIS:   Actually the charter flew into the private hangar and my mom brought her to the airport.  As soon as she saw me her arms were out wide and she came running to me and wouldn't let go.  It was the best.  Every time I drop her off to daycare this week she thinks I'm leaving again, so that's the only bad part.
 Just being back with her and my husband, things feel a little bit normal again.
 Q. When you left, speaking of leaving of Chesnee, your dad told me you got out of the car three times to say good bye to Chesnee.
 STACY LEWIS:   Are you trying to make me cry?  That was the worst.  You know, she is starting to figure it out a little bit.  FaceTime helps, but at the same time, I want her to know that I did this when she was little, and hopefully one day she's pretty proud of her mom.
 Q. The point was made on the air that you might be in one of the best places from your professional career standpoint and mentally as a person.
 Do you feel that way?
 STACY LEWIS:   100%.  Just I have so much more patience on the golf course now because of Chesnee.  You know, I'm happy off the golf course.  I love my time off the golf course more than anything, so it makes golf easier.  Makes going to practice easier.
 Life is good right now.
 Q. Stacy, still a great round today.  Six birdies and that one bogey.  What was that feeling like to go out there today and have the first round under your belt?
 STACY LEWIS:   Well, felt really good.  I was a little bit sluggish and tired this morning, so I was glad I had the morning to relax.  Really started off -- made birdie on the 1st hole and made four birdies on the front, which is pretty rare for me.  I usually play the back nine better.
 So just excited to play well and make two birdies there to finish.  Makes dinner taste a little better.
 Q. Great.  And after playing the first round, what are you thinking about tomorrow in terms of your game?  Are you going to focus on one thing more than the other?
 STACY LEWIS:   It's really kind of sticking to what we're doing.  Looking forward to the better greens tomorrow morning.  They were pretty rough there at the end.  I kind of told myself just need to hit it closer.
 So good greens tomorrow morning and hopefully can roll a few more in.
 Q. We've been asking a lot players how they feel with no fans here, a lot less noise.  How do you feel about that?
 STACY LEWIS:   It's so strange.  I almost made a hole-in-one on 17.  I couldn't imagine what been like late on a Friday afternoon and everybody is off work.  They would've gone nuts out there.
 So those are the moments you miss it.  There are definitely some people on they're porches and patios watching and cheering.  Gaby and I got a hog call down 6 I believe it was, so we're still feeling the love.
 Q. Yeah.  Speaking of playing with Gaby, how was that?  Did you share a lot of stories today?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, well, it's fun watching her play.  You can see she learned from my coach, Shauna, as well.  You can kind of see a little bit of yourself in her.  She was grinding out there today and kind of pulled it together on the back nine and still played pretty good.
 I don't know.  You see a lot of yourself.  And she's still learning.  She's young in her professional career and still learning.  Seems to be doing a pretty good job of it so far.
 Q. Lastly from me, what does it feel like or what does it mean to be able to keep playing this tournament this year despite everything?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I mean, just a huge thank you to Walmart and P&G for allowing us to come here, and the state of Arkansas.  I'm sure there were a lot of people behind the scenes that okayed all this.
 We're so appreciative of the opportunity.  To get women's sports playing and on women's sports on TV right now is what we need to do, so it's just thank you.
 Q. You tee off tomorrow morning two back from the leaders.  How much was that momentum on 17 and 18 to carry into tomorrow?
 STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, the finish today was huge.  I mean, on this golf course, 3-under versus 5-under is a big difference.  So just to finish the way I did, kind of figured a few things out with golf swing towards the end, I'm looking forward to the quick turnaround.
