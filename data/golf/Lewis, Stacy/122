 Q.  I know you were disappointed, but got to be glad to see Jess win.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, Jess played unbelievable today.  Nobody was going to beat her.  When you have a two-shot lead and shoot 6-under it's pretty hard to beat.   
 Q.  Just a bit of a slow start there?  Seemed like you had it rolling on the back a little bit.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, you know, I just didn't hit ball as well as I had been the last two days.  It was a little bit more after struggle.  Just proud of way I hung in there.   
I think I did a lot of good stuff this week and a lot of good things to build on.   
 Q.  How do you plan to spend on the week off?  
STACY LEWIS: Getting back to the U.S. is going to be really nice for a week.  Just relaxing and keep working on a few things.   
Really just resting and getting ready for the next stretch.
