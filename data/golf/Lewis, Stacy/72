Q. 8-under on the front side this week.
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.
Q. What's been working for you there?  What do you like about it?
STACY LEWIS: Honestly, it's just that I've had more momentum going into that side than I have when I've played the back.  I played the back early yesterday and just wasn't striking it very good.
Then today, coming out after the delay you kind of lose some of the momentum there.
But I played sold for two days and still left some out there, so it's some good golf.
Q. Seemed like wind really died down after the delay.  How differently did the course play?
STACY LEWIS: It was a lot different.  The wind that was there was the complete opposite.  Hard part was you had in your head the way you were going to play the next few holes, then all of a sudden it's a complete change.
It was just hard at the end of the day.  The greens got slower, too.  I would say that was the biggest difference:  speed of the greens at the end of the day.
Q. Seemed to get softer with the rain?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, definitely got softer.  We had been playing it up all week and I hadn't had any mud until after that delay today, so it was definitely a lot softer afterwards.
Q. Kind of a grind toward the end there?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, you know, you get -- 16 is a hard hole and I hit a good shot.
Then 17 made a great par.
18, is just a hard hole.  If you can make par there you take it and go home.
I played solid.  Gave myself some birdies chances all day, and I'm pretty happy with it.
