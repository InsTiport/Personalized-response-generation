  Q. 1-under today. Talk about your round a little bit and the conditions as far as with the rain last night.   
 STACY LEWIS: Well, the conditions, the greens are just a lot softer, but they're still as fast. So you still have to be on the right side of the hole. The greens are more receptive.   
 I played better today. I hit better iron shots. I had five putts either lip out or go right over the edge. I could have shot -- I mean, I finished at a really good number today.  
  
  Q. You birdied 9. What club did you hit into there?  
 STACY LEWIS: 3-wood.  
  
  Q. Is that playing 210?  
 STACY LEWIS: 220, I think. 221 to the hole, and it was into the wind. I hit a 3-wood.  
 It looked perfect right from the get-go.  
  
  Q. 11 you birdied, as well?  
 STACY LEWIS: Birdied 11. Hit a 4-iron, hole high, about 15 feet right of it and then made the putt.  
  
  Q. What do you think, did the greens kind of firm up as the day went on?  
 STACY LEWIS: No, they actually stayed pretty consistent. The first hole, I actually had an 8-iron spin backwards. They kind of dried out a little. We're making pitch marks, and the divots are pretty good in the green.  
  
  Q. They're pretty soft?  
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah. If you're hitting it well and hitting it solid, you can get some good iron shots.  
  
  Q. How about the wind compared to yesterday?  
 STACY LEWIS: Similar. Strength-wise it's just a different direction.   
  
  Q. Is it swirling again?  
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, in the back it did swirl some. 9 is playing into the wind. Some of the longer holes they're playing longer.
