   THE MODERATOR: Stacy, welcome. Good playing today, a 5-under 67. Talk a little about it? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I've been playing well, and I played really well today. I even left a couple out there which is good for the rest of the week. So I'm really happy with it.

 Q. So Mexico's kind of been good to you this year? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, it seems like it. Every time I come to Mexico I play well. I don't know what it is, but I've also just been playing good in general, so it's been fun. 

 Q. What specifically is going well for you? Obviously you played well last week, and as you mentioned you've been playing well this year. 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I've just been hitting it really consistently. Hitting a lot of fairways and finally getting some putts to go in. 
 I think all the birdies I made today were pretty long putts. So putting has been key for, I guess, the last four weeks now.

 Q. You're coming off from a great play in the Mizuno Classic. So how are you going to keep this going because sometimes you haven't kept up with it, so what is your plan to keep it up? 
 STACY LEWIS: I think I'm just going to stick with what I did today, which is I put myself in position to make birdies and get a few putts to fall. 
 The final round last week really helped me to just realize that I can play with the best players in the world. I was actually really comfortable there. So I think that's going to help me a lot going into the weekend.

 Q. Which was your shot of the day? 
 STACY LEWIS: Probably the shot I hit my approach shot into 15. At that point I was 3-under in the round and I had just kind of been making pars and I needed to get something going. I hit a great shot out of the right rough to about probably 10 feet and made the putt for birdie. So I think that was the shot of the day for me.

 Q. How much do you have to adjust for Mexico?
 STACY LEWIS: It's actually really hard. I'm still kind of adjusting. Off the fairways to and this grass the shots seem to jump a little bit too. But I think it's somewhere between 5 and 10% depending on how long the shot is and how long it's in the air and things like that. 
 But I had some shots today that just went crazy far for me. So I'm still trying to adjust to that.

 Q. What was the toughest thing on the course today? 
 STACY LEWIS: I think it was definitely just figuring out how far my shots were going. Early in the round I hit a couple of wedge shots that just went really far. So it was adjusting to the altitude and figuring out how far the ball's going this week.

 Q. For us as Mexicans this course is like a treasure. We consider it one of the best in the country. How do you think it pairs up to maybe courses around the world? Would you consider it one of the best? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I've never been here and a lot of the caddies told me it's one of the best courses we play all year. That's what they told me last week. Then coming here, it's awesome. It's a great practice facility. The golf course is in great shape. The greens are rolling really good. So I was actually really surprised and impressed.

 Q. After 112 years, golf is going to be back in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. That is a great testament of what this sport has been able to do and accomplish. Could you give us your thoughts about that? 
 STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think over the last 10, 15 years golf has become so global it was almost kind of dumb that it wasn't in the Olympics. I think it's great. 
 We actually played a tournament in Brazil, and the fans were great down there. I think it's a great thing for our sport, and I think it will be great for Brazil too.

 Q. We know that you don't get to talk to Lorena a lot. But you were able to talk to her this week. What is your impression? Is she happy to be back on the course? Is she happy to be back to the tournament? 
 STACY LEWIS: I haven't talked to her very much, but I'm sure she's probably happy just to be playing and not have all the pressure that she's used to playing with. 
 I know I played with her in her final round. She played in Morelia, and the fans were amazing. They loved her so much. But you could see the pressure that it put on her. I don't know, I hope this week she can just enjoy it and just play golf.

 Q. This golf today may be one of the best for the weekend. What do you feel about that? 
 STACY LEWIS: I was very happy with it. I left a couple putts out there, I think, and a couple shots I would take back. But I think this golf course is hard and you have to hit a lot of good shots. At the end day I think I'm going to be in a really good spot. A couple more of those this weekend wouldn't hurt either.
