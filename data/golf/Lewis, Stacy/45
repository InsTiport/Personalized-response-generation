 Q.  So that was a pretty good round today.  It was pretty colorful there at 7, 8, 9.  Was it birdie, eagle, bogey?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell us about that stretch.  
STACY LEWIS: Well, 7 hit a really good shot out of divot in the fairway, actually, to like four feet and made the putt.   
Then 8 they had the tee up, which helped me out a lot.  I hit 5-wood and actually almost made it.  Went right over the left edge to I guess 6 inches; tap-in eagle.   
Didn't hit a good drive on 9 and made bogey.  But played really well today; can't be too upset.   
 Q.  We're hearing there is a lot of difference in the greens from yesterday to today.  What's that like?  
STACY LEWIS: You just know when you come out in the morning you need to play well.  There is definitely a difference putting on the greens, and I think the biggest difference was -- I mean, our back nine yesterday the greens were so firm and it got pretty windy.   
I just thought yesterday was hard to get it close.  This morning I thought it was a little easier to get it closer.  The greens definitely putt better.   
 Q.  How do you feel heading into the weekend and then into next week?  
STACY LEWIS: I'm excited.  I typically in the past haven't played very well here, so just to post a number like that is encouraging.  Just really right now in a place of trying to get better every day and get into more of a rhythm.  The more golf I can play right now the better.   
I'm excited to have two more days to move up the board.   
 Q.  Speaking of rhythm, how the baby doing?  Is she starting to get used to things?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, we're starting to figure things out.  Just getting the door in the morning and kind of the routine when you get home.  Officials keep gives us these late/early tee.  I think I would rather have early and then late, but we're figuring it out.   
I have my mom here as help.  Yesterday morning she kind of allowed me to sleep in a few more hours so my day didn't start at 6:00 a.m. like last week.  Definitely a little more fresh late yesterday.
