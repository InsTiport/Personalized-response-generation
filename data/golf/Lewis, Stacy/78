Q. What an awesome round you had today.  Talk about how fun it was, especially on the front nine.
STACY LEWIS: Well, got off to a great start.  That was the beginning.  Just making some putts early; hitting a lot of good shots, and great putt on 8; 9 was awesome.  The 9-iron was perfect in the air.  Nice to see it go in.
You kind of start thinking a little bit about what you're shooting at that point, but just tried to keep hitting good shots.  I did that for the most part most of the day.  If you'd tell me at the beginning of the day I would shoot 8-under, I would take it any time.
Q. What was the distance on that eagle?
STACY LEWIS: 136.
Q. Not that you wanted to be putting for par, but those were some good par saves you had on the back.
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, you know, kind of back there on the back nine the ball started going really far.  You know, maybe some adrenaline, I'm not really sure.  Or just the dry air.
We'll look at that going into tomorrow, being able to control my irons a little bit better.  I had a lot of downhill putts where you're going to have four-footers, five-footers coming back.
Made some really good putts, a good bogey putt on 18.
Q. How was the lie on 18?  We couldn't see you down in that trap.
STACY LEWIS: It was pretty bad.  It was kind of back up against a rake mark, so ton of sand behind the ball.
Q. Short sided?
STACY LEWIS: Didn't have a shot at it.  Yeah, just trying to make bogey at that point.
Q. Tell us about the pairing with Ariya.  I don't know what your best ball score would've been, but pretty amazing.
STACY LEWIS: Be pretty good.
Q. How good was the pairing?
STACY LEWIS: Well, Anna, she birdied the first two holes and got off to a great start.  We were all making putts.  We all played kind of the same rhythm too, and I think I that helped.  Nobody was slow.  Just going along there nice.
It's always great putting with Ariya because you know you're going to get to see good golf and see putts go in.
Some of the drives and two irons she hits are pretty amazing.  I enjoy playing with her, and she's a good kid, too.
