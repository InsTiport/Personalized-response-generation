 Q.   Well, 18 has been beating you up all week, and you showed it who is boss today?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, my goal all week was to get over the creek in two, and I finally did.   It was nice to finish out the week strong.   
I struggled all week, but things came together throughout the day and I just finished it off really good.  
   
 Q.   You're 5‑under.   What a way on Sunday to finish.   It's not where you want to be, but still, 5‑under is pretty good.   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, any time you shoot a low number on Sunday, you just hope you're in contention and have a shot at winning.   So just drag momentum into next week and keep playing good.  
   
 Q.   Another turn here in your hometown.   Just talk about what it's been like to be back the last several days and what it means to you?   
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's been crazy.   I come back every year and I'm playing better and better.   It just gets crazier and crazier, so it's a good thing.   My family was so supportive all week, and finally gave them something to cheer about today.   So I'm just happy to finish it off with them, and thank the whole town for their support this week.  
   
 Q.   Do you put anything extra on yourself to want to play better here?   
STACY LEWIS:   Oh, absolutely.   I want to give my family something to cheer for.   I want to play good here.   I think today I finally realized I've got to play golf for myself.   If I make a putt here and there, great, if not, move on.
