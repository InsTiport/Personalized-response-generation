Q. I know that today some of the putts weren't falling for you, can you talk about that?STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I didn't play well.  Didn't make many putts.  Had a bunch of three-putts, and it wasn't a good day.
Q. Going into tomorrow what are you trying to accomplish?STACY LEWIS: I've got to make more putts, that's the thing.  I'm hitting the ball good enough, I just need to make some more putts.
