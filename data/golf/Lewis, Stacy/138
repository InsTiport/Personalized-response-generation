Q. It looked like every iron shot was going in this hole today.  Have you hit your irons that good this year?STACY LEWIS: No.  It's been a really long time since I felt that way over the ball.  Just disappointed with the hybrids coming in. Other than those two swings on 8 and 9, everything was right where it needed to be.  It's nice when you are tapping in a couple 5-irons.  All in all, pretty solid.Q. One of the surprising things to everybody is the speed of the greens.  As Michelle was just walking off, she was shaking her head saying can you believe how slow these are.  Did you sense that?STACY LEWIS: Yeah, they're slow to start the day and then they get even slower as the day goes on.  Then you add the traffic and the spike marks of soft greens at the end of the day, and they are twice as slow. The downhill side, the side hill putts are hard.  It's hard to get yourself to hit them hard enough, but yet they are still going to break two feet.  That's the challenge of it is just getting the right speed with the right line.Q. Just kind of flared that hybrid on 18?STACY LEWIS: I pulled the one on 8 and pushed the one on 9.  8, fortunately I missed it in the right place.  Then at 9 that miss has got to be left all day.  More than anything that's what I'm kicking myself about.Q. Do you like where you are at right now through 36 holes here?STACY LEWIS: As things stand right now, being in the final group tomorrow, which is right where you want to be, I like the way I played today.  I definitely actually could have been a couple more lower if I made a few putts.  I was just happy with the way the ball striking today.  You have to hit fairways on this golf course and that's what I've done so far.Q. Is there a tournament that stands out in your mind that was the purest you have ever struck the ball that you can think of?STACY LEWIS: I don't know.  I mean, I think probably the most confident I felt given the conditions was at the British Open.  That's probably the most confident I've felt over the ball.  I don't keep track of all that stuff.Q. What are you trying to think about or not think about overnight when you are in a position like this?STACY LEWIS: You are just having fun with your family and friends.  That's what I've been doing.  We played cards last night.  Power went out in our house for a few hours, so we played cards in the dark and ordering pizza and hanging.  We were thinking about everything but golf.  The family kind of had the golf on TV and I walked away and went and did something else. I'm trying to keep away from it.  This golf course is hard enough that you don't need to be thinking about golf other than those five hours that you are out there.Q. What game did you play and did you win?STACY LEWIS: Of course I won.  You can ask the crew over there.  It's called Jerky Jack.  It's kind of a sequence kind of game.  It's kind of a family game that we play in Toledo and we brought the board with us here too.Q. Will you do that tomorrow before you play to kill time?STACY LEWIS: No.  We just play it at night.  I'll probably go to the gym in the morning and kind of do what I did today.  I will probably tee off, I'm guessing, around 2 o'clock again.  I have a pretty good routine of sleeping a little bit, going to the gym, coming out here ready to go.Q. You had a good weekend at last year's U.S. Women's Open, especially Sunday, a big charge.  A memory like that, is it relevant?  Does it help?STACY LEWIS: Yeah, because you know you can do it.  You know you can get on runs where you can make some birdies. That's what I was telling myself on the front nine yesterday.  You can have nine bad holes and still win this golf tournament.  Just knowing that you can get hot and make a bunch of birdies and put a good number out there.  I was watching scores a little bit today and nobody was going low or anything, but I felt like it was an opportunity to move up just because no one was doing anything.  Just the more time you are in position, the better.Q. People not going low, we heard equal parts tougher pin placements and the greens.  Is that pretty much why, you think?STACY LEWIS: Honestly, I think it was setup.  It was hole locations.  There were some out there that were just -- it was brutally steep.  If you get on the wrong side of them, you are going to be struggling to two-putt. The hole locations are pretty tough.  With the slower greens, they can put them on four and a half percent, which on a normal speed of a green you wouldn't get close to that.Q. What do you hit on 18?STACY LEWIS: 18, I've hit hybrid the last two days.  We played the up tee.  Practice rounds, I hit 3-woods.  It's just a long hole and it is what it is
