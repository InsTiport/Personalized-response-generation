 Q. You holed some lovely long putts out there the last couple of days.  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, and putts that kept the round going.   That's the thing.   I've made them at the right time.   I've had good speed all week.   Just had a lot of tap‑ins, even when they're not going in.  
   
 Q.   You had to be patient is right.   Birdie at the 5th hole and then you had to wait a while for the next birdie until 13.  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it was a day that I just had to stay patient.   Even coming in I could have made a few more birdies.   Didn't quite hit the shots around the greens that I needed to.  
    Shot 5‑under and made six birdies today, so it's a good day.  
   
 Q.   Good day for Texas, as well.   Playing with Brittany tomorrow.  
    STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun.   We're good friends with her and her brother.   It's good to see her playing some good golf.   Nice to see another American flag up there on the leaderboard.   It's be fun.  
   
 Q.   You're one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour.   Between now and tomorrow's tee time, will you go to the gym?  
    STACY LEWIS:   Oh, for sure.   I'll go through my same routine.   I will be at gym tomorrow morning.   With this jet lag I'm up pretty early anyway, so you got to kill some time.  
   
 Q.   We've got the bowling challenge tomorrow.  
    STACY LEWIS:   I won't be a part of that, but I'll be pulling for the caddies, no offense.  
   
 Q.   Question related to Brittany.   Brittany said tomorrow playing with you, you've known each other forever, good friends, but she can learn a lot from you as a player.   How does that make you feel knowing how well respected you are and people can take a lot from you?  
    STACY LEWIS:   It's cool.   I don't really think that of myself, so I guess it's pretty cool that they think that of me.  
    More than anything, she's a great friend of mine.   She hasn't really played her best at times this year, so it's good to see her playing some god golf.  
    It's always fun playing with her.   Her and her brother are always good for some laughs, so we'll have a good day.
