Q.   You shot 67 in the third round, coming to the final hole with three straight birdies, bogey on the 18th, you have to be pretty pleased with how you're going into the final round tomorrow?
STACY LEWIS:   Actually, probably the opposite.   Pretty disappointing.   I left a ton of shots out there today.   Just the greens were a bit softer and I just didn't quite adjust to it.   Speed was a little bit different, and just didn't make the adjustments.

Q.   Going into tomorrow, a lot of low scores today, what do you think is going to needed to be done tomorrow to come out on top? 
STACY LEWIS:   It's going to have to be superâ€‘low at this point.   I needed something today.   Just watching the leaderboard, watching the scores early, I knew I needed a low one just to get close to the lead. 
But you know, anything can happen.   I'm going to go try to make as many birdies as I can but I would have liked to have got a little bit closer today. 

Q.   You're right in the mix.   Has it crossed your mind about how special it would be for you to defend here and defend your title? 
STACY LEWIS:   It would be awesome to win here again.   I've said over and over again, this is my favorite tournament and I love the concept of the entire event.     Just to win here, having the founders here, to win in front of them, it means a lot.
