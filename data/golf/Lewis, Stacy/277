Q.   What did you do on the rain delay?
STACY LEWIS:   I sat inside for a long time.   Bernie and I played cards.   We just kind of sat around and talked, and then when the rain slowed down I decided to go out and hit some balls just because I figured that would be the only time we could hit balls all day.   So hit a few balls and putted a little bit.   And looks like we're going to be going home.

Q.   It's going to be pushing everything back.   Does that push off your schedule, your routine, things like that?   How do you keep all that straight?
STACY LEWIS:   I think coming into the day everybody knew what the weather was going to be.   We knew it was going to be a long day, long week.   It always is here.   So ‑‑ I mean we're golfers.   We deal with rain delays all the time.   So you just have to stay patient with it and when you have an opportunity to play, just be ready to go and hopefully your golf swing can stay in a rhythm.
But when you have the opportunity, you just gotta be ready.

Q.   Plans for the rest of the day?
STACY LEWIS:   I will probably go to the gym and get some lunch and maybe a movie later.   It's kind of nice.   You know, we don't usually get days off, a full day off at least.   So it's nice hopefully that we'll be able to get out of here and rest, because it does take it out of you when you do have to sit at the golf course all day.

Q.   Restaurant, is it going to be Wegmans?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   I've already hit up Wegmans a couple of times this week, so I don't know if I'll go back there or not.   May have to venture out.
