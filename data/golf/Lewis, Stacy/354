MODERATOR:  One of the observers said they thought maybe your back was stiffening up a little bit early on out there.  Didn't have any problems with it?
STACY LEWIS:   No, I just wasn't swinging well early.
Q.  You went 1 down the first hole and bounced right back, win the second hole.  What was your impression how the match played out today?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know, I was down the whole day, and I didn't    I started playing well like from 13 on.  Played really well.  And, I don't know, just fought and thought I made a couple of those putts coming in.  But it just didn't work out.
Q.  Yeah, I heard that toward the latter part of the match you were really playing better?
STACY LEWIS:   Yes.
Q.  Then your opponent?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, I hit the ball pretty bad early.  Then finally found a swing that was actually working a little bit.
Q.  What was that?
STACY LEWIS:   Just to not let my left side open up.
Q.  Was it nerves?  Was it just, hey, you've been playing a lot of days?
STACY LEWIS:   It's just golf.  It's just golf.  Not a whole lot you can do.  And didn't hit some    had some hard chip shots.  When I hit good shots it was like my shot on 8 I had no idea how that flew into the green.  It was just, I don't know what it was, actually.
Q.  What club did you use on 8?
STACY LEWIS:   An 8 iron.  I guess I just hit it too good.  I don't know.
Q.  That is golf.

How do you sum up the week for yourself?
STACY LEWIS:   I'm pretty happy with it.  And pretty happy with the whole summer.  And really wanted to win today.  But that's how it goes.
Q.  And where do you go from here?
STACY LEWIS:   Back to school.
Q.  This was the last one of the year for you?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, school starts next Monday.  I'm actually playing over the World University Golf Championships in Italy.
Q.  When will that be?
STACY LEWIS:   First week of September.
Q.  That's right around the corner?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah.  Couple weeks.
Q.  How does this stack up in your previous golf experiences?  I know you won Western?
STACY LEWIS:   Pretty high.
Q.  Pretty high?
STACY LEWIS:   Yes, it's pretty high up there.  It's been a great week.  It's been so much fun.
Q.  You talked about obviously being happy with this summer.  I mean did you learn anything about yourself?  Did you    how are you a different golfer now maybe even than at the end of the semester?
STACY LEWIS:   I learned that I'm a better match player than I thought.  Always struggled with it in the past, and finally figured it out, I guess.
Q.  What did you figure out?
STACY LEWIS:   Probably just moving on to the next shot and the next shot is the most important one.  It's a lot easier to do that in match play, too, I think.
Q.  Stacy, tell me about 14th, where you brought the match back to all square, long par 4, dogleg down the hill?
STACY LEWIS:   She hit it in the rough left.  We were both about the same distance.  But she hit first.  Was short of the green.  I hit and I was short of the green, too.  But she putted up and barely got on the green.  Then I putted mine close like to a foot.  She conceded it.  Then she missed her putt.  She had probably an 8 footer, 7 footer I would say.
Q.  How long was your first putt?
STACY LEWIS:   From off the green, probably 15 feet, maybe.
Q.  15?
STACY LEWIS:   15, yeah.  Around there.
Q.  1 5 and not
STACY LEWIS:   Right.
Q.  Very good.  You should be proud of yourself for what you did and really put yourself up there and the top echelon in women's golf.  Very good.  Thanks very much for coming in.
