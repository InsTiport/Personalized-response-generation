 Q.  Not what you guys wanted, but how overall would you describe how the first match for you went?  
STACY LEWIS: We hit a lot of good putts, they just didn't go in.  And the Europeans just made more putts than we did.   
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, definitely.  We started off really well, just couldn't find the hole, bottom of the cup.  Hit a couple of lip-outs.  We still fought through every shot and gave each other good opportunities for birdie.   
So obviously we're not happy about the outcome, but I think we're on the right track and we have a lot of matches yet, so it can go either way.
