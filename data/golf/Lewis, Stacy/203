Q.   Great round today,71, what was working out there for you? 
STACY LEWIS:   I just scrambled today.   I got the ball in the hole and that's what I said coming into the week I needed to do was just getting the ball in the hole.   I didn't hit it great but made some good up‑and‑downs and made a few putts which was nice. 

Q.   And you were paired out there with Charley Hull and ` Uehara.   Do you feel like being No. 1, how well you're playing, you inspired them?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know.   I mean, they were fun to play with.   They both played really, really well today.   Ayako obviously put up a really good number.   She seems like she wasn't in trouble at all.   She was just greens, greens, center of the green every day.   You can kind of learn a little bit from that and maybe not go at so many pins.

Q.   We had some great weather and you're one of the few in shorts and a tee shirt.   Do you feel lucky that you missed some of the heavy winds that can come through? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, you see that 6:52 tee time, and you're like, ah, because you have to wake up so early.   But once you get out here, it's a great time to have.   It's when the winds are the lightest and you can hopefully take advantage of the golf course a little bit.   But you know you're going to get some wind out here.   It's just the way it is.

Q.   How happy are you with your score heading into round two tomorrow. 
STACY LEWIS:   Very happy with it.   You can always do a couple shots better.   That's just golf for you.   Just happy to shoot something under par, be in the red numbers is a good place.
