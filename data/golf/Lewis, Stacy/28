Q. Feel like you're still within striking distance?  Still have a shot at this?
STACY LEWIS: I do.  As long as it stays windy and the golf course keeps playing hard I think there is a good round out there.  I feel like I'm getting really close.  I did a good job hanging in there today.  I thought it played pretty tough.
Just keep inching a little closer to playing some really good golf.  That's all you can do.
Q. Do you think about a number you have to shoot or do you just go out and play?
STACY LEWIS: No, it's just going out and trying to hit good gold shots and making good decisions and controlling and I can control.  The wind was really tough today.  It was all different directions and hard to pick a club.
You know, just really need to putt it a little better and I'll be in a good place.
Q. I know a couple times today you stopped and waited for that wind.  Is that something you just got to get that out of your mind, try to take as much control as you can?
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, you know, we were talking.  I don't think I've ever played this tournament with this much wind before.  It's kind of strange here.
Figuring out do we trust what the weatherman says or do we trust what it feels like.  That's kind of what we are were trying figure out on the golf course.  I don't know if we every really did, but you just do the best you can.
Q. Speaking of the wind, on the 9th hole, with that 250 yards it seems so close yet it's so far for a lot of reasons.  What's the risk/reward on that hole?  What's fun about it?
STACY LEWIS: I like it drivable, it's actually a very hard tee shot because if you go a little left there is out of bounds right there and you see a lot of people in those trees up there.  The right is no gimme up and down.
So the window to hit that tee shot is about ten yards.  It's really good risk-reward hole I think.
