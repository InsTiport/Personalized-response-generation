 Q.  You said you knew it had to be a low number today.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, I was a couple back starting the day.  Got off to a good start really.  Got off to the start that I needed.  Played the par-5s better which is what I wanted to do yesterday but couldn't quite get the putts to fall.   
Hit a lot good shots and didn't quite get rewarded for them.  I played well.  Hard to be too upset.   
 Q.  As we creep closer to ANA as well, starting to feel like getting yourself in a good place for that?  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah, I think so.  Got to clean up the putting a little bit.  I think that's going to be key going there.   
This golf course is pretty similar to that one.  Not quite as many birdies are played there, but still kind of some desert golf and the ball goes pretty far.   
Good warmup for in this week.
