 Q.   Well, how did you think it went today?  
STACY LEWIS:   It was a little frustrating.   I played really good, though, so I can't be too upset.   
A lot of those putts I hit exactly where I wanted to and they just didn't go in.   A bogey‑free tournament I've never done before, so my coach ‑‑ I keep checking things off of his list.  
   
 Q.   Were you aware of what was going on on the leaderboard?  
STACY LEWIS:   A little bit.   I didn't realize Suzann had gotten out to 21.   I think I was on 13 when I saw that.   I expected her to be maybe 19 or 20, but I didn't expect her to be that fair.   She obviously played some really good golf.   
I had chances there at the end, but I wouldn't go back and hit any of those putts or those shots any different.  
   
 Q.   How many putts do you feel like you maybe left out there?   
STACY LEWIS:   Off the top of my head, I can think of three or four that were right there on the edge, a couple of lip‑outs, couple that just broke right in front of the hole like the one on 18.   
But at the same time, I hit them where I wanted to, I hit them on good speed.   So I can't be that upset.  
   
 Q.   Would you say most weeks if you go bogey‑free, you would win?   
STACY LEWIS:   You would think if you went bogey‑free you would win the golf tournament.   It's just you're making so many birdies out here and everybody is scoring so low, unfortunately that's kind of the way it is.
