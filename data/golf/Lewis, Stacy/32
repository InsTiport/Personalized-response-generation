 Q.  Obviously you got to feel really good coming off 18 or 9 here today.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  How good of a feeling is this after round one?  
STACY LEWIS: It was awesome.  The biggest thing is I hit 18 greens today.  I've been working on the ball striking a lot, so just really nice to see some results.   
Got a few putts to fall there on our last few holes.  So just to get off to a good start in this tournament I feel like is always pretty tough.  Finally got one this year.   
 Q.  Yeah, you and I talked about that the other day.  
STACY LEWIS: Yeah.   
 Q.  This course, for whatever reason, just hasn't worked.  From that perspective, does it feel even better?  
STACY LEWIS: It does.  You know, it's a golf course I'm not necessarily 100% comfortable on.  I just had some really good golf shots today.  Had some easy tap-in birdies.  I haven't done that in the long him in general.  Just felt really good out there today.   
 Q.  How different do you feel this year as opposed to last year carrying a baby and everything?  
STACY LEWIS: It's so different.  I was thinking about this time last year I was going back and taking naps and no practicing afterwards.  So completely different.  Different level of tired I would say.  Just pretty crazy to think I have an eight month old right now.
