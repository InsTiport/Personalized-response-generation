 Q.  Just going to ask you, did you watch her at all? (Regarding Maria Fassi/NCAA.)  
STACY LEWIS: I did.  Yeah, I went up there for about a day and a half and watched some the golf and watched what I could on TV.  It was pretty cool.  There was no way anybody was going to beat her on that last day.   
Just cool to see all the fans that came out and watched the finish.   
 Q.  Did you get to congratulate her at all as a fellow Arkansas...  
STACY LEWIS: I did.  I sent a text to the coach who kind of passed it along.  They were moving straight from that into match play so didn't want to bug her too much.   
Just cool to see.  I know she's worked basically for four years for that moment.  Pretty cool to see her do it and do it the way she did.  She shot 5-under on windy conditions on that golf course.  It's an incredible round of golf.   
 Q.  And then just looking to this week for you, preparation for the U.S. Women's Open, how are you feeling about your game?  
STACY LEWIS: I'm feeling good.  I'm excited to have this week just to test some things out and see where we are.  Really this golf course is playing a lot like what we'll see next week with not being overseeded and Bermuda grass and fast greens.   
So this year it's a great prep leading into the U.S. Open.
