Q.   You must be disappointed.   Give us your reaction. 
STACY LEWIS:   I'm disappointed.   The back nine that Pornanong played was pretty impressive.   She hit golf shots when she needed to and made the putts, and I didn't.   I hit the shots, just didn't give myself‑‑ just didn't make any putts. 

Q.   The putt on the 17th, can you tell us something about that?
STACY LEWIS:   Right when I pulled the club back, a camera went off right behind me.   It's happened before and I should have been able to keep going, but it distracted me enough and I pulled it.
It's disappointing, just because I hit a pretty good shot in there.   Hit it pretty close and had a good look at it.   Just bad timing.

Q.   How far would you say that putt was?
STACY LEWIS:   About six or seven feet.

Q.   And on 18? 
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it was a lot of bad shots, bad tee shot and then I had a pretty bad lie in the rough off the tee, and then so that came out of the rough left.   
Then I hit a really good shot just to get anywhere over the water, and to end up where I did was pretty good.   But I didn't make any putts all week and it was just kind of the theme.

Q.   What club did you hit on 18?
STACY LEWIS:   6‑iron.   I know I had about 140 to carry the water, so about 152 to the hole. 

Q.   And the putt?
STACY LEWIS:   I don't know, 40, 50 feet.   It was pretty far.

Q.   As disappointed as you are with the way the tournament finished, your thoughts on the season, the amazing season that you've had?
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, it's been a really good year.   It's had its highs and lows.   I've played some really consistent golf.   These last few months have kind of left a sour taste on it, just kind of losing a couple of tournaments right at the end. 
But if anything, that leaves me with stuff to work on in the off‑season and just shows that there's always room to get better. 

Q.   Does that give you motivation? 
STACY LEWIS:   You always kind of like to leave with a win, but just to know I played some really good golf this week, but I could have done a lot better.   Gives me some things to work on and I know what I need to work on next year.

Q.   A camera flash, does that annoy you‑‑
STACY LEWIS:   It normally doesn't.   It was just very quiet on that green, and it was just right when I pulled the putter back. 

Q.   Are you able to forget about that when you're on the next tee box?
STACY LEWIS:   It is what it is.   It could have hit a spike mark.   It could have lipped‑out.   You can't really go too much off that.
