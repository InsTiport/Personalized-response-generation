 Q.   A long day, it's going to be a long day tomorrow, but you seem to be holding up pretty well, two back of the leader.   Talk about your day.   
STACY LEWIS:   Well, it was a good day.   It was fortunate I think getting out in those first couple groups, and able to play a lot of holes today, which was good.   It'll help tomorrow.   Just finally saw some putts go in.   That was the big difference.   I feel like yesterday and the first two rounds I hit the ball really well, it was just the conditions were so unbelievably hard that it was just hard to make putts.   I finally did that today.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about going into tomorrow?   Do you feel pretty good?  
STACY LEWIS:   I feel good.   I would have liked to have finished that round off today, but just going to bed with a good number posted so far, you know, I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   We're going to have to‑‑ Lexi and I are going to have to keep making birdies like we did and hopefully get off to a good start like we did today.  
   
 Q.   Does it matter that there's not going to be a re‑pair, so does that help?   Does it matter?  
STACY LEWIS:   At this point I don't think it really matters.   I think for us we went out there today to try to make birdies, and I think we've got to do that tomorrow.   We started pretty far back, so just go post a number and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   At one point there were like six people tied for first and like 15 within a shot.   Were you noticing how tight it was?  
STACY LEWIS:   Yeah, when we made the turn I kind of started paying attention to scores a little bit, just seeing what people were doing.   It looked like to me nobody was really going crazy in those leader groups, which was good.   It was fun Lexi and I going back and forth making a bunch of birdies and got both of our names up there on the leaderboard.   I think we'll try to hopefully help each other out there tomorrow and get some good, positive vibes going.  
   
 Q.   Does it affect how you approach it when there's that many players that close?  
STACY LEWIS:   No, not really because there's just less you can control when there's that many people that close.   In one aspect it's almost easier because you can't worry about one person, you can't pay attention to one person because then somebody else is going to jump up and pass you.   In a sense it's almost easier.
