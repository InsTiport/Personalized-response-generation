 Q.  How do you feel you played today over the two matches?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Today I was definitely striking the ball pretty well.  Overall game was very solid and consistent.   
So I definitely -- yeah, that's it.  Solid and consistent.   
 Q.  You're a quarterfinalist at the U.S. Girls' Junior.  How does that make you feel?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I'm super excited and my competitors I went against today, they're extremely phenomenal golfers and I just -- I don't know what to say.
