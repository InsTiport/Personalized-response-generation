 Q.  Overall you must be pleased with a round of 66 today?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Yeah, it was a good round. Made a lot of birdies. Gave myself a lot of opportunities and pretty pleased with the way I played.   
 Q.  As the week's gone on, each round's got better and better. Is that a case of getting to know the course, or is there something in your game that's improved over the week?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: I guess both. Game has been improving as the rounds have been progressing. Obviously it's my first time playing at Wentworth and learning more about the course with more rounds.   
It's shown I played really good today. I was reading the greens really well. All in all, pretty solid day.   
 Q.  After last year's success, fair to say this year, results have been slower; what's changed this week?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: I've not been playing bad the last few weeks. It's just about putting in four good rounds together. Just the whole year has been a bit slow, but haven't felt like I played really bad. It's just about getting the right breaks and putting in four good rounds. Hopefully I can do that this week and get on a good run after this.   
 Q.  You are right up there. How excited are you about being in contention going into tomorrow?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Really excited. Really looking forward to tomorrow. It's a great course. A lot of birdie opportunities. So anything's possible and I'll try my best tomorrow.
