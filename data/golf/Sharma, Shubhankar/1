Q. How good was that for you?
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Really good. I knew I had to shoot a low one. I'm very happy.
Q. What does it mean to you getting to Sun City?
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: It means a lot. Wasn't quite sure I was going to get into this week. Had to play my way into this week, and just making it to Nedbank is just the cherry on top. Really happy.
Q. And to try to get into Dubai, as well?
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Yes, that will be the main goal for me, making it to Dubai. I haven't had a great season, but I'm happy that I'm finding my form now towards the end of the season and having a strong finish.
Q. Positives of the game you're taking out of this week going ahead?
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Everything is coming around. Hitting the ball really well and hitting my irons close and putting well. Pretty happy with the way the game is right now, and it's all trending in the right direction.
