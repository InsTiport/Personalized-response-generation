 Q.  A 66, terrific end to that round, birdie at 16 and eagle at 17. Tell us about that from your point of view.  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: I hit a lot of good putts before that and they weren't falling, so I was kind of getting easier to make a few birdies coming in. That tee shot on the 16th was really good, a great 4-iron to about seven, eight feet, and I made that putt.   
17, again, a good drive and a good 4-iron to the middle of the green and that putt obviously was a bonus. It was like a 40-footer that I made, so pretty happy.   
 Q.  Overall how well did you play today?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: I played pretty good. Pretty solid. Obviously you always feel like you left a few shots out there but I'm pretty pleased with the way I played. It's great first round and I'm looking forward to the next few days.   
 Q.  You've been traveling a lot this year, a couple months away from home. You said you went back home and had some of mom's cooking. How much did that help?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: It helped a lot. Saw my family and hung out with any friends. So just kind of got my mind in a better place. I didn't go to the golf course at all for days and just came here and practiced on Monday. I feel like sometimes you need that and I'm pretty happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  How much are you looking forward to tomorrow, fresh greens in the morning and a real opportunity, potentially?  
SHUBHANKAR SHARMA: Slightly gusty today in the afternoon when we were on 10 and 11. I don't think we'll get that tomorrow morning. Teeing off pretty early tomorrow. So, yeah, looking forward to it. Playing well.
