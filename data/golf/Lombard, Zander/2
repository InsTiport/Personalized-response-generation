Q. Your reflections on that 72.
ZANDER LOMBARD: Just couldn't get it going today. I mean, I was 3-over after the eighth, and I had a good fight back to get it back to level par. Then I flushed a 6-iron on the 16th and made a sloppy bogey. I thought it was going to be par, but got a bogey there.
All in all, I'm still in the lead. Got to stay positive and really looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. You mentioned being 3-over after eight. That would have knocked a lot of people off-course and you managed to bounce back. How so? What did you do that got you back on track?
ZANDER LOMBARD: I didn't really make any mistakes. I just hit or missed two or three fairways that really put me behind the 8-ball, and you can't attack this golf course if you're not in the fairway. But stuck to my guns and started driving it better at 9 and 10. Yeah, it was much better golf on the back nine.
Q. Describe the adrenaline rush you received from the support today.
ZANDER LOMBARD: It's amazing. South Africans crowds love their sports and love their golf. It's great to have them here and coming in mass tomorrow.
Q. A year ago you were battling away at Tour School to regain your playing rights. Tomorrow you'll have a chance to win Africa's Major. Give us your thoughts on that?
ZANDER LOMBARD: I don't want to sound cocky, but it's been a long time coming. I've really made big strides in how I do things on and off the golf course. It's nice to get some feedback and some results from the hard work.
