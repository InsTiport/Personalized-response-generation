ZANDER LOMBARD: I hit the ball in the good spots.  Just excited to come off the course at 4-under.
Q. What do you think of the conditions at Carnoustie today?
ZANDER LOMBARD: I think it's playing fair.  Even if you stray, you've got a chance at making par.  Have a chance to avoid the bunkers, which I did today.  You've got a chance to control your ball out there, and I think I did pretty well.
Q. And after playing well today, how much confidence has that given you?
ZANDER LOMBARD: It's been a long road to get here.  I worked really hard for six months, played subpar golf.  But really quite a bit of confidence going off the Irish Open, and I'm just in a good space of mind and ready for the weekend.
Q. Zander, you were confident hitting into the first round.  How much more confident are you right now with a solid round under your belt?
ZANDER LOMBARD: You don't win it on Thursday, but my ball striking gave me confidence today, and I hope I can take that form into the next two days.
Q. And seeing ahead of you Erik also playing well, Erik van Rooyen?  Does that help you?
ZANDER LOMBARD: Absolutely.  Us South Africans, we feed off each other's confidence.  We're all good friends.  It's nice seeing each other play well.  Hopefully, we can motivate each other to get the win.
Q. How much of a factor was the wind today?
ZANDER LOMBARD: It was really, really out there, but it made it quite tricky because you couldn't really allow for it sometimes.  So it was a tricky working it out there.  I think still the main thing is to keep it in the right spots.  And even without the wind, some holes play completely different to what it did in the previous two days in the practise rounds.
But it's links golf.  The weather can change.  Anything can change.  Just have to take each shot on its own merit.
