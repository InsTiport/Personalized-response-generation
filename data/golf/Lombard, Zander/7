Q. Solid round out there for you.  Your thoughts on how you played?
ZANDER LOMBARD: Yeah, I think it was pretty solid.  I managed to make a few good up-and-downs to keep the momentum on the right side.  That's so important in links golf is just to keep going and fix your bad shots.
For me, it was definitely two good up-and-downs on 4 and 5 to just set the theme for the round.  Yeah, I was just solid all the way in.
Q. 4 and 5 are those quirky holes, as well.  How did you find them?
ZANDER LOMBARD: I really did enjoy them.  I think it's not too ridiculous, but it's to a point where it makes you think.  It's something we don't play every day, so something different.  It's always fun and new is good in golf, especially.
Q. The back nine, as well, coming in with the afternoon and late draw, as well, four birdies, I think it was.  How did you find your game adjusting over the course of the day?
ZANDER LOMBARD: Yeah, I did an up-and-down from short right on 12, and I was kind of mad at myself for that because I kind of thought if I can just hang on there until 12, and I have a good chance at birdie there and I didn't make it.  Just kind of took that anger in a positive way and just played really good golf in from there.
