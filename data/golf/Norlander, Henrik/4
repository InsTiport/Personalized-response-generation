 Q.  Henrik, tough golf course.  You started with two bogeys but bounced back rather nicely.  
HENRIK NORLANDER: Yeah, I thought I hit (indiscernible) on both 10 and 11.  You don't really have a shot if you're close to the lip.   
I made a few pars and then I birdied 14, which I think is probably the toughest hole on the course.  Sort of got me going a little bit.   
Then I holed out from 156 on 15 for eagle, and then I played really solid.  Made 11 pars and one birdie and hit every green I think.  Just really solid.  I hit every fairway, every green.   
 Q.  How do you describe the challenge of this course?  
HENRIK NORLANDER: It's brutal.  It's shocking.  I think it's the toughest golf course in the world.  I haven't played many tougher.  You can't relax on one single hole.  There is not one single hole where you can get away with hitting a bad shot and still make par.  You've got to stay focused for 18 holes.   
You should probably stay focused on every golf course for 18 holes, but here if you lose focus you're making bogeys and doubles quick.  The greens are pretty fast and firm and a lot of slope, so they're really tough.   
 Q.  (Question regarding the greens.)  
HENRIK NORLANDER: Yeah, they're pretty firm.  Going to be pretty firm this afternoon, that's for sure.  Interested to see how they are for us tomorrow afternoon.   
Try to stay patient and try to hit your numbers and stay away from some flags.  Some flags you just can't get -- you can't get to some flags and you just got to accept that.  If you start firing at flags you're going to make doubles.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
HENRIK NORLANDER: Oh, yeah.  I'd be happy if I make 54 more pars.
