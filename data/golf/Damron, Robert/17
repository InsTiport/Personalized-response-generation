Q.  Robert, obviously you've got to be pleased.  What a great found.

ROBERT DAMRON:  Yeah, things were going my way early.  I just finished with a couple bogeys but I would have taken a 66 and not played at all today.


Q.  How much did the wind play into it down the stretch?

ROBERT DAMRON:  Just a little.  I think it kind of got into  my head, more than anything, because the birdies were not going to be as easy later on, and I knew it.  And they were coming easy early, so I just kind of through it up.


Q.  Any home-course advantage here in that 66?

ROBERT DAMRON:  Sure.  You know, standing over putts, I think the only advantage is standing over putts.
