Q.
Just a couple quick comments about how you thought your round went today.
ROBERT DAMRON:  It went good.  It's nice to get off to a good start.  I've been getting off to bad starts for a while, and it seems like I'm scratching back late to shoot even par, so to get a few more early was nice.
Q.  What in particular about your game today was working well for you?
ROBERT DAMRON:  Pretty much everything.  I don't think I did anything bad today.  I rolled it well.  I didn't make anything.  I drove it well.  So I just gave myself a lot of chances.  I didn't really come close to making a bogey, so that means I was doing everything pretty well.
Q.  How is the golf course playing out there?
ROBERT DAMRON:  Yeah, it's nice.  It's playing pretty fast, and the greens are getting scary late in the day like this, so it's nice.
Q.  How do you feel your chances are coming in tomorrow and maybe getting up there at the top of the leaderboard?
ROBERT DAMRON:  If I do what I did today, it shouldn't be any problem, if I hit the ball and roll it the way I did.

It's a little early to make any predictions, but I like what's going on so far.
