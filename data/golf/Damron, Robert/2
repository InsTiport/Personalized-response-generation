Q.  Got out there early and had a pretty good day out there.
ROBERT DAMRON:  You know, my start the last few years has been so bad, I didn't know what to expect.  But I'm playing well, so everything went pretty well.  The course is in    it's the best it's played in, I can't even remember; as long as I've played here.
Q.  What are you doing well that you're playing so well right now?
ROBERT DAMRON:  Putting well.  I'm hitting the ball pretty solidly.  But I'm chipping and putting well.  I've struggled with my driver the last few weeks and I kind of managed to get it in the fairway for the most part today so hopefully I can keep that trend you up.
Q.  Comfortable here?  Does that make a difference, being close to home?
ROBERT DAMRON:  Not really.  Once the tournament starts, it really is just a another tournament.  Most of the course, local knowledge is out the window because the course plays different than it does day in, day out with the rough and the green speed.  It is nice to be at home and not have to go back to a hotel room.
