 Q.  Pretty steady day for the most part, a couple birdies, only one bogey.  
HAILEE COOPER: Yes.   
 Q.  How do you think you played today?  
HAILEE COOPER: Pretty well.  I was solid.  My goal was to hit every fairway, and I think I did that.  My goal coming out here was fairways and greens because when you get on the green you have some good chances to make some putts, so that's kind of what I did today.   
 Q.  Talk to me about the approach shot on 18, putting it less than four feet from the cup.  
HAILEE COOPER: Well, there was actually some mud on my ball, so we were like, okay, I think I had 140, but we played it a few yards up, and so I was like, I just hope it gets on the green somewhere, so it actually went a lot closer than I thought.   
 Q.  Was there one part of your game that you think you need to improve on tomorrow?  
HAILEE COOPER: I need to work on some chipping, like short-sided chip shots.  I had a few of those, but maybe like work on some uphill lies or something like that, kind of was hitting those a little unsolid, maybe some chips around the greens out here.  That's it.
