 Q.  So congrats.  Big wins today.  You're moving on to the semifinals.  How does it feel?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Awesome.  This is the furthest I've ever made it in match play either by myself or the first time with a team.  It's my first time making it to a semifinal match, so I'm super excited.   
 Q.  Good.  
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, it's an honor to be here.  There's tons of great teams and we played really well this week.   
 Q.  So tell me about your match that you just had.  It was over the Whiston sisters.  It must be interesting to play sisters?  
HAILEE COOPER: It was a fight.  They were really good.  They made a lot of putts.  We just made a few putts back, so it was good.  It was a dog fight all day, we were fighting back and forth.   
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, we kind of went back and forth all day.  Eventually on the back nine we just kind of pulled ahead.  We made a good par on 11, and then they birdied 12, and we bounced back with a birdie on 13 and 14, and then they birdied 15.  We parred 16, and all of us birdied 17 for us to win.  So it was a grind all the way till the end.   
 Q.  You guys both seniors?  
KAITLYN PAPP: I'm going to be a senior.  I'm finishing my junior year.   
HAILEE COOPER: I'm going to be a junior.   
 Q.  So you're class of '18?  
HAILEE COOPER: Yes, sir.   
KAITLYN PAPP: And '17.   
 Q.  How did you form your partnership?  I know you live in the Houston area, and you live in Austin.  That's not that far, but did you guys play together much before?  
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, we've been playing together since we were like 12, 13 years old at AGGA tournaments and now high school tournaments we play together a lot.   
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah.   
 Q.  Who called who to decide to play this year?  
HAILEE COOPER: She called me.  I didn't even know this was here.   
 Q.  You guys obviously didn't play last year?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Huh-uh, no.   
HAILEE COOPER: No, sir.   
 Q.  Did you know about it last year?  
KAITLYN PAPP: I knew about it, but I didn't really know who to play with or who was playing.   
HAILEE COOPER: I think we had another event or something.   
KAITLYN PAPP: After I heard how great of an event this was, I was like, hey, I should form a team and come out here and come play.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you go to the same high school as Kristin?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Yes.   
HAILEE COOPER: Uh-huh.   
KAITLYN PAPP: They're friends.   
 Q.  Any thought of teaming with her?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Well, I was thinking about it, but she made plans to play with Sierra, and, yeah.   
 Q.  Obviously it turned out to be a pretty good decision for you.  
HAILEE COOPER: Yes.   
KAITLYN PAPP: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What's clicked for you to be partners?  Why do you guys mesh so well as a team?  
KAITLYN PAPP: I think our accuracy off the tee and our distance off the tee helps.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah.   
KAITLYN PAPP: And we just hit a bunch of greens in proximity to the hole.   
HAILEE COOPER: We do good with the match play like, okay, they made this putt.  We do good at planning.  That's another thing, we plan well.   
 Q.  Have you played much four-ball?  
KAITLYN PAPP: We've played --   
HAILEE COOPER: I've played a lot.   
 Q.  You've played a lot?  
KAITLYN PAPP: I played Wyndham Cup for AGGA I've played before and the Solheim Cup we both played.  I think we did four-ball together.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, we did.   
 Q.  At the Wyndham Cup?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, at Wyndham Cup and Junior Solheim.   
 Q.  When you get into match play there's a lot of different things you can do with your opponents.  If one person's away, you can putt first and take the pressure off each other?  
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, that's what we've been planning.   
KAITLYN PAPP: You definitely have to strategize well.  It helps.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, different putts if they're going to read.  We do good talking about it, and talking through shots.  So that's good.   
 Q.  Is it more enjoyable to do this with a partner?  
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah.   
KAITLYN PAPP: It's a lot more fun.   
HAILEE COOPER: Less stressful.   
KAITLYN PAPP: Especially if you aren't doing so great on the hole, your partner's there to back you up all day to day.   
 Q.  Not saying sorry too much?  
KAITLYN PAPP: No, that's our rule.  Never say sorry.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yep.   
 Q.  You guys have a chance, you're in an area where there's a lot of fun things to do off the golf course.  Did you do anything before or after this event's over with Disney or anything?  
KAITLYN PAPP: I don't have time.  I have a tournament right after this.  I was going to fly out there Thursday.  I don't know if I am anymore since we're playing tomorrow.  But I have a tournament right after this so basically after this tournament's over, I have to leave.   
 Q.  In Texas?  
KAITLYN PAPP: In Arizona.  It's an AGGA tournament, thunderbird.   
 Q.  Do you guys go to school?  
KAITLYN PAPP: No, I got ahead.  I basically finished.   
HAILEE COOPER: I have finals next week.  But my dad said if we win, I'm going to Disney World.   
KAITLYN PAPP: Nice.   
HAILEE COOPER: So I'm trying to win.  Get to skip school on Thursday and go to Disney.  The whole family's going to fly out.   
 Q.  Spend some time with Mickey, right?  
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah.   
 Q.  You guys said you birdied 14 and 15?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Yes, 13, 14.   
 Q.  Tell me about those birdies, if you don't mind?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Short par-4.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, they almost made, they had like a 30-foot birdie putt.  Another girl was out of the hole.  She almost makes it.  I think we were 1 or 2-up at that point.  1-up?   
KAITLYN PAPP: We were 1-up.   
HAILEE COOPER: We wanted to get ahead.  We both had about a six-footer right in the middle, made them.  Nice, uphill putts.  Then the par-5 was the next hole, right?   
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, par-5.   
HAILEE COOPER: Kaitlyn made her putt first.  We both hit it inside 10 feet, and she made her putt.  They made birdie also, right?   
KAITLYN PAPP: No, they barely missed so we won the hole.   
 Q.  So those two holes kind of sealed the deal for you, pulled you far enough away?  
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, it was nice.  We had a comfortable lead, even though they birdied the next hole, I had to make a 6-footer for par, and we both birdied 17, which kind of finished it.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah, it was good.   
 Q.  What's the overall experience been like so far this week?  
HAILEE COOPER: This course is awesome.  It's so weird, because I've played in Florida and there is nothing like this.  I think the course makes it something special.  There's just such cool shots.  It's nice.  It's a nice place to play.   
KAITLYN PAPP: The course is great.  Everyone here is super friendly.   
HAILEE COOPER: Yeah.   
KAITLYN PAPP: And then just playing with a partner makes it a lot more fun.  It's not about yourself.  It's about the team.
