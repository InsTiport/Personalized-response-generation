 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Alone.   
  
  Q.  Is that customary for you to do?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  No, because it is all full, but that's okay.   
  
  Q.  What do you like about links-style golf courses, about Muirfield?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Tough, it's more tough than normal, and The Open.  It's more tough than Carnoustie.   
  
  Q.  The rough looks really long, doesn't it?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Narrow and long.   
  
  Q.  How is your game?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Not bad.

 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  No, just play hole-by-hole.   
  
  Q.  Nice to reach The Seniors Tour now and be here?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  It's very good.  Still play, still here.  That's the most important.   
  
  Q.  Show the crowds a good time and good golf?   
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Yeah, the golf course is very good. Good condition.   
  
  Q.  Were you inspired by the weekend, watching Paidraig and Sergio's tussle?
