  Q. How did your day go?  
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA: 2-over. Not so good, but back nine coming back very good.   
  
  Q. You had a good back nine there, a couple birdies and --  
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA: A couple birdie and like a bogey.   
  
  Q. The course getting tougher as the day goes on with the sun beating down on it a little bit?  
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA: It's not a fun hole, you cannot miss some shot and if you miss on the wrong side, you make a bad score.   
 On No. 9 I hit a very good 7-iron and just three yards short and it bounced and go back down. And I make bogey.  
  
  Q. What do you change between this afternoon and tomorrow morning when you go off early?  
 CONSTANTINO ROCCA: Oh, I don't know, maybe there is less wind tomorrow morning and you try to make the score less.
