  CONSTANTINO ROCCA: I have never, ever played golf with anybody as wonderful as this lady (Model Ines Sastre). She helped to inspire me but I have been playing really well of late. I have hit the ball good and close and big difference was that my putting really worked today.


Q. Been a bit tough for you recently?

CONSTANTINO ROCCA:  Yes, all down to my putting. I have felt great, driven well, but when you don't putt and can't putt, you don't score well. Today the putting came back and that is why I was four under par. Shame about the last (where he pulled his approach shot left and made bogey five) but to have got round Carnoustie in four under par is a great effort and now I am really looking forward to the next three days.
