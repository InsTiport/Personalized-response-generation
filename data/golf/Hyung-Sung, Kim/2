 Q.   Kim, very, very convincing win for you, how much does this win mean for you and for Team Asia?   
KIM HYUNG窶全UNG:   A lot of luck today.   Pablo wasn't on game, so I felt like I had a good time today out there and I just enjoyed it.   I thanked my caddie for helping me out there in certain situations, so it was a good team work out there.   
   
 Q.   After yesterday's round, what did Thongchai tell Team Asia?   
KIM HYUNG窶全UNG:   Thongchai brought the group together and said go out and play your own game and enjoy it and don't try to put too much pressure on yourself, which is not easy.   But I went out there and enjoyed the game and had a good time.  
   
 Q.   After the first round whitewash, how do you manage to come back and compose yourself?   
KIM HYUNG窶全UNG:   Well, we had nothing to lose.   We just went out and played our game and things turned around yesterday.   It could have been better, but like today, it gave us a chance so it was fun to be out there.   We had nothing to lose but everything to gain.  
   
 Q.   Was it tough playing out there looking constantly at the leaderboard and looking at the scores?   
KIM HYUNG窶全UNG: Well, today when I was looking at the scoreboard, the Asian teams are really doing well, and so it made me out there, it made me play a little harder out there and gave me confidence, so I think the vibes are good today.   The Asian team played really well, so it just helped me play better.
