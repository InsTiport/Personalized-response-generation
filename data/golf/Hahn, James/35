Q.   Talk about your round, what was working for you? 
JAMES HAHN:   Played isn't that right r smart.     Started off well.   Made a good par on 10 and then just kind of put myself in a lot of good positions off the tee to put myself in a good position on the green and then was fortunate enough to roll a couple in. 
I feel like I'm hitting them on line with the right speed, so any time you do that, you feel like you have a chance of making some putts.   Just trust it and make sure you hit a good line and put a good stroke on it.   I was fortunate enough to do that today. 

Q.   (How important was it to finish with three birdies)? 
JAMES HAHN:   I'm not going to say it was real important but it felt good to close out a round like that.   I felt good today, so the score to me is almost irrelevant‑‑ I know that's kind of silly to say but I just feel like I'm hitting a lot of good shots.
So whether I feel like a shoot even par or 5‑under, I feel like I have a good chance of competing this week.   I had some good numbers coming in.   I had a good 7‑iron to 3 1/2 feet on 7. 
And on 8, I hit a wedge to about 2 1/2 feet. 
18, I drained a long one from about 35 feet.   So it's good to see the ball go in the hole.
