 Q.  Nicely done.  Everybody in your group is one and one with a point, heading into the last of the matches tomorrow.  
JAMES HAHN: Oh, yes, definitely we were looking at the Day/Dufner match, and now it makes things a little interesting.  You kind of think -- you hope for that scenario to give yourself a chance tomorrow.  And we all put ourselves in position.  Dufner played great.  And that's just the name of the game.   
 Q.  You bring a good question, are you guys actually paying attention?  Obviously you know who is in your pod?  
JAMES HAHN: Absolutely.  We know who is leading, how many points you need.  We definitely need to keep track of who else is doing what to give yourself a chance for tomorrow.  It gives you extra motivation to play better, but we're all trying our hardest out here.   
 Q.  The wind came up today.  
JAMES HAHN: To me, it played a little easier.  Wednesday we had a hard time picking lines.  The wind was completely different.   
To play this course today it was a lot easier, and that definitely made me more comfortable.
