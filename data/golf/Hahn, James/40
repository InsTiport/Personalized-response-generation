Q.   What a great start and this golf course here, maybe not knowing it well is better than knowing it well?
JAMES HAHN:   Yeah, I had one practice round out here and took yesterday off and was kind of resting up a little bit, sixth straight golf tournament for me.   Usually don't do that.   Just played it the way it should be played, tried to hit as many fairways as I can and as many greens as I can and not hitting it close and hopefully roll in some putts.

Q.   What's been really the big key for you?   That's a great start this year. 
JAMES HAHN:   Started off well early in the round, birdied the first hole and usually when I do that I feel more confident to hit some tee shots and hit some shots over the green.   Been rolling it really well these last couple weeks, so it feels good to see them go in. 

Q.   What is it that makes Riviera, was it one that maybe you were probably thinking, I might not even get in at the beginning of the year, as well as you played, getting to play this week. 
JAMES HAHN:   I definitely didn't plan on playing six straight, so if I had this week off it would have been kind of a blessing but I love the golf tournament, all the history behind it and I figure this is one of the biggest tournaments for me so early in the season. 
But you know, one of the big goals of mine last week was to finish Topâ€‘10 and so that way I have a better chance of getting into the event, and that's what I did and now I'm just continuing my good play and just kind of riding the wave.
