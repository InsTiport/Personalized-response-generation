Q. A good back nine there, especially getting the birdie on 18 keeps you in the thick of things going into tomorrow?
JAMES HAHN: Yeah, it was a good front nine and back nine.  Didn't hit the ball all that well on the front.  Managed to just make nine pars, and sometimes that's half the battle.  Hideki started off well and birdied four out of his first five, so I felt like he's making a move and I'm sitting still.  But I managed to make a couple birdies coming in.  Finished 3-under and keeps me in it for tomorrow.
Q. Scoring the way it is, a lot of birdies on this course, is that a style of play that typically suits you or do you like it if it's a little more difficult?
JAMES HAHN: Either/or.  If I'm playing well, I can make a lot of birdies like I did yesterday.  When I'm not playing well, it's tough out there, because you see guys moving up the leaderboard and it makes you want to press a little bit.
But it's not really a golf course that you can overpower.  You really have to pick your clubs well off the tee and give yourself a good chance from the fairway.  But all in all, it's fair and there's a lot of birdies out there.
Q. Do you like this trip, Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, being here?
JAMES HAHN: I do.  I think it's amazing, seeing kids come out and watching us play golf, we get a lot of spectators out here comparable to a PGA TOUR event.  So it's good to see that the game is growing.
Q. Anything in particular you'll do tomorrow?
JAMES HAHN: Probably thinking 24-under is going to win tomorrow, so about 10-under, course record would be nice.  And then make a hole-in-one and get a BMW.
