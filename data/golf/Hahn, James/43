Q.   Nice round today, only one blemish on the card, and I only saw one score better today out of all three at 6‑under, but 5‑under, pretty darned good. 
JAMES HAHN:   Yeah, definitely hitting the ball good today.   I gave it a lot of looks.   I bogeyed No. 10, which is the par5.   I had 3‑wood in there and was standing up against a rock, chipped it out and didn't get up‑and‑down.   So it's a little bitter to bogey a par 5, especially in these conditions. 

Q.   The last few holes, it looks like you got good looks the last three or four. 
JAMES HAHN:   Yeah, the greens are rolling great.   Just a matter of reading them with the right speed.   Just burning the edges, so hopefully they will fall in this weekend.

Q.   Did the squirrel have the right of way on 17?
JAMES HAHN:   Absolutely.   I was scared, because they steel golf balls, not sure if you know that.   They have before. 
Actually, you know I'm a YouTube addict, I've seen it on YouTube, and everything on the Internet is true, right? 

Q.   You're in contention and good after two rounds?
JAMES HAHN:   Yeah, I don't know, I haven't seen what the other scores are. 

Q.   8‑under is the lead. 
JAMES HAHN:   It's a marathon out there; we are halfway done and we have two different golf courses left to play tomorrow, Spyglass tomorrow, which is the tougher of the three, so hopefully I can get a good round out there and compete on the weekend.
