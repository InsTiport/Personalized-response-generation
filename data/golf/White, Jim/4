  Q. Jim, did the course play different for you this morning than yesterday?  
 JIM WHITE: Surprisingly it didn't really. Club selection was pretty similar. The wind was quit a bit different today. But the golf course as far as the greens speed and firmness and everything it seemed like it was about the same as yesterday afternoon.   
 So they probably put a little water to them last night, not a lot. But, no, it was very fair. It was out there, you could -- if you hit good shots you got rewarded.  
  
  Q. How is the overall experience been the last couple of days?  
 JIM WHITE: Great experience. I thought that this was really a great setup. The facilities, the staff, the golf course is in phenomenal shape, very, very tournament tough as you can see by the scoring, it's not really good. Some guys are playing great and can get it under par and that's how it should be.
