  Q. Overall how would you describe your time here this week?  
 JIM WHITE: I played -- I've been fortunate to get to play in a lot of these things. And I felt like I was hitting it good all week and I got to the tournament and I couldn't get settled down for about the first 12 holes and then after that it was pretty good.   
 I love the golf course though, I think Ben did a great job. He had a great piece of property and it's very visual, you can see all your targets and, yeah, it's set up great.   
 But, no, he did a great job with the setup and unfortunately I didn't make anything.   
  
  Q. What are some of your highlights of your two rounds here?  
 JIM WHITE: I don't know that I really had any. Actually, the highlight was probably having a lot of family and friends come out, since I wasn't that far away. It was the first tournament we were able to drive to in a long time. So that was pretty nice. But other than that, the golf, there wasn't any highlights.
