  Q. Was it just the wind or what is it?  
 JIM WHITE: Just too rough for me. The whole thing is just ridiculous. I played terrible. I played pretty good the front and then just terrible. No game today.  
  
  Q. Just too tough right now with the wind and everything?  
 JIM WHITE: How many guys shot under par? One guy shot under par and that was this morning. So that says it all right there. If they wanted to play it tough, they got it. Five inch rough and 10 Stimp greens, it's pretty bad.
