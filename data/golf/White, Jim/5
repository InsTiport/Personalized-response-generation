 Q. Talk a little bit about your sixth appearance here at the Senior PGA Championship and what it means to you to get the first round out of the way here. 
 JIM WHITE: You know, it was one of those -- I loved my pairing, I had Dana Quigley I played with him for quite awhile, he's a good player and he hits it straight and a good guy to play with. And Joe is a really nice guy, so the pairing make as difference. 
 We had a good time. The weather was perfect. The golf course was great. I felt like I hit the ball better than my practice preparation would indicate, but yeah, it was nice to get it out of the way. I bogeyed the last two, which is kind of frustrating, but that's the way it goes.

 Q. What can you take from today into tomorrow's round?
 JIM WHITE: Actually, I didn't do -- there wasn't anything that was anything out of the unusual, no good breaks, no putts falling, and yet I got it to 4-over. So you know, I feel like I can improve on that tomorrow and still have a chance to make the cut and see what happens.
