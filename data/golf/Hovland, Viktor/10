Q. Nice turnaround from yesterday.  What was clicking today that wasn't yesterday?
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, I started off hitting a couple shots kind of close to the hole, and I just made the putts from the get-go.  So I got a really good feel on the green and really just kept that going.  Pretty solid ball-striking and made a lot of putts.
Q. When you get it going like that with the putter, do you get that feeling like if I hit it well I'm going to score well because now the putter is rocking?
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, exactly.  The bad shots, they don't affect you as much because you feel more comfortable that you're probably going to make it up-and-down.  All you have to do is just hit decent shots and you're going to have a good chance to make par or birdie.  Yeah, just kind of relieved, a lot of stress.
Q. What did you maybe learn last week about this course that really helped you today even?
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of places that you have to land them in different spots.  You can't just take on the same lines into the greens as you did last week.  Playing here a bunch, or a lot the last couple weeks, I know kind of the different contours on the green, where the up slopes are and kind of where the slopes are you can kind of use to feed it closer to the pin instead of just taking it right on because it's just going to bounce over the green.  So I'd say just I've become more familiar with the greens.
Q. Have you heard this week that when Nicklaus turned pro in '62, he played 16 out of 17 weeks right out of the box?  I wonder if you had heard that at all.
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   No, never heard that.
Q. Given what you're doing, can you relate to it at all?
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, this is my sixth week in a row, and I'm getting pretty tired, so 16 out of 17, that's getting it.  But it's fun.  I could get used to doing this every week, so yeah.
Q. Did guys give you the silent treatment after you made the birdie on 8?  You were 6-under for the day; did they start to go, we'd better leave this guy alone?
VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Not really.  I kind of went into my own head a little bit, but we still kept on talking and we had a good atmosphere in the group.
