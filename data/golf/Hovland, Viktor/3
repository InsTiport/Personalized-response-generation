  Q. How difficult is something like this to deal with considering it looks like the penalty that you got last night is going to cost you the cut?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, it's unfortunate.  Can't do -- I mean, I've already kind of put that past me.  I'm just more disappointed that I wasn't able to play better because I had a good start today, and if I would have just kept going in that direction, I could have been, let's say, 5-under par and then going into the weekend with a chance to win the golf tournament.
 I already put that past me, but yeah, just disappointed I didn't play very good today.
