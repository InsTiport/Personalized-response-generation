  Q Congratulations after what must have felt a very long week.  We know the week after a success of a victory, the following week is twice as hard.  How have you found it?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   I've done a good job resetting myself.  It's a new tournament, new week.  You have to show up and give it your best stuff.  I played some good golf this week and wasn't quite enough, unfortunately.  A little bitter, but all in all the last two weeks have been pretty cool.
 Q The leaderboard moving around has been changing hands a lot during the day.  How conscious are you of what's been happening?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, I was paying attention, obviously with my good start today, I thought I was going to be in a pretty good position.  Made a wrong club choice on four and bogey there and thought I was going to be in good position.
 I looked at the leaderboard on 5, and saw Matt had a really nice start and a couple other guys and that made me realise I had to make some more birdies.
 Q Given it's been a strange year by most standards, but the incredible success you've experienced, how do you look back on this year and what do you take from it?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Obviously two wins, that's been very special but kind of the biggest positives I'm sticking with it.  Just looking at how my game has improved since the beginning of the years, or even last year, previous years, I feel like I've taken a step in the right direction, and I'm excited about the future.
