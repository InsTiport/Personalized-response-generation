Q. So I'm going to read you a scoreboard, you tell me what it is, okay. Four players, minus 2, minus 1, plus 1, plus 2. What do you think that group is?
VIKTOR HOVLAND: You tell me.

Q. That's the group of the four amateurs that made the cut. 
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Okay.

Q. And you're currently leading the group of four. 
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Awesome.

Q. How much would it mean to you to come away from this weekend as low amateur at the 2019 Masters?
VIKTOR HOVLAND: That would be, yeah, that would be pretty sweet. Obviously winning the Green Jacket is the ideal, but it's not very likely playing as an amateur and the first time in the Masters. 
So, you know, achieving the silver medal is something that's a little bit more I guess likely, you can say, if I play really well. So that would mean a lot, but then again, I don't, I can't control what the other guys are doing, so I just need to play well and see where it stands. 

Q. So on the amateur circuit and also at the U.S. colleges, have you played against this group of guys much and if you have, what kind of success have you had?
VIKTOR HOVLAND: So I've played a lot with Alvaro, we're pretty good friends. 
And I've only played with the Japanese Amateur once, we played in Australia for the Australian Open. 
And Devon Bling, yes, I played with him in the final of the U.S. Amateur. 
So I haven't played with them a whole lot but I'm familiar with their games and I know they're very capable of shooting a low number out here. 

Q. So what do you do tomorrow? Do you concentrate on your game, just trying to get the lowest score or are you sneaking a peak at the score boards? Is?
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Oh, I'll check it out, I'll check it out to see how things stand. No, I'll go back and eat and probably, I don't know if I'm going to practice, I'm pretty tired, so I'll just rest up and get ready for tomorrow.

Q. And finally just talk about your round today. 
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Yeah, I got off to a really bad start. I didn't birdie No. 2 and I hit some bad shots on 3, 4 and 5, or 4, 5, and 6 and was 3‑over after six holes, but I made a nice birdie on 7 and when I dropped a really long one on 10 that kind of got me started and, yeah, so it was really, it was really up‑and‑down. I hit a lot of good shots but I hit some really bad shots as well, so unfortunately I wasn't consistent enough to shoot a really low number, but I'm proud that I was able to kind of grind it out.
