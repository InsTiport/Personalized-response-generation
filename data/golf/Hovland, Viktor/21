 Q.  Some comments on your round, if you could, please.  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Got off to a hot start with an eagle on 2 and eagled No. 5 as well. Made another nice birdie on 8, and I was thinking maybe if I shoot 4 or 5 under on the back nine as well, it could be a really, really good finish, but just didn't really hit the shots that I needed to hit and didn't really make any putts coming in either. So just ended up with a bunch of pars.   
 Q.  How would you assess your game after these first two weeks?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Not the best, to be honest. I haven't really hit it the way I would have liked to hit it. I felt like I really was in a good spot over the break, especially with my longer clubs, just how I was able to shape it both ways and hit a low, hit a high. It's a little one-dimensional now, I feel like, and I really need to kind of work on my -- working especially with the longer clubs and the driver, just straighten out the ball flight a little bit.   
But other than that, I'm really pleased with kind of finishing the way I have been considering how my game's been.
