 Q.  Very, very well done.  What a great way to finish.  Talk about that?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Thank you.  Had a very good start obviously with 4-under through six, seven holes.  And then kind of started to stumble a little bit, didn't hit the greatest shots coming from 8 until 14, probably.  But I managed to kind of take damage control on a couple of holes.  And obviously finish on 17 and 18 was huge for just to make me feel better going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're about to turn pro, what does it mean to go out and play a course like this with the pairing that you were in and go toe-to-toe with Molinari or with Brooks?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Yeah, it makes me feel pretty good.  I don't feel like I had my best stuff.  I'm not hitting it quite where I want to and how I want to.  So that really gives me a lot of comfort knowing that I can hang with the best in the world with not quite my best stuff.  So, yeah, that makes me feel really good.   
 Q.  The mindset going into tomorrow?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: I just try to play like I did the first seven and the last two.  Try to play a little better in between.  But just kind of play smart, take one shot at a time and hopefully make some putts.   
 Q.  You said you were nervous.  Did the nerves go away or did they stick until the birdie on 18?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Yeah, I was very nervous, way more so than I was at the Masters.  The Masters I felt really calm.  But after -- I'd say after I made the putt on 3 I really started to feel comfortable.  And after that I just kind of plugged along.   
 Q.  Is that pressure of you winning here, maybe everybody on the planet talking about your swing or what?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: It's just who I am, I guess.  I mean there's pressure, for sure, but there's so many other good players out there that I kind of go under the radar still because I'm an amateur and all that.  So I just try to do my best and hopefully it's good.
