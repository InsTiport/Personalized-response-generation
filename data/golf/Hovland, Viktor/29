 Q.  What's the verdict after that first round here at the BMW PGA?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: It was a little up-and-down today. In the end, I'm happy with a 69 after some bad shots here and there. Especially with that drive on the last that somehow managed to stay out of the trees, and yeah, ended up converting for birdie. That was nice.   
 Q.  We were all keeping notes to see if this streak of rounds in the 60s would continue. Was that in your head at all?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Not really. Just a couple weeks ago, or a month ago maybe in the first Korn Ferry Tour event, I shot two rounds in the 70s and I don't think people noticed that. So the streak isn't maybe as long as people think it is. But no, I didn't really think about that. I just tried to shoot as low as I can and see how it goes.   
 Q.  What are your feelings now that you've sort of played here on the European Tour in such a big event, the environment of it and the fact that you were playing obviously with The Ryder Cup captain?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: It's been a blast so far. Obviously a lot of people out here, and it's cool to be playing in front of them. Thankfully I made some birdies today, and just keep that up.
