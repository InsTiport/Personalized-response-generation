  Q. I know you've made quite the long trip to be here.  How are you feeling?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   I could be feeling a lot worse.  Took a nice little sleeping pill last night so I was able to sleep a little bit.  I feel a lot better now this morning, so ready for a good week.
 Q. The last time we saw you on The European Tour was actually right here in Dubai at the start of the season.  Feels like a very long time now.  Been quite the year for you on the course, especially.  How do you summarise the kind of success and the kind of results that you've had in not just the big events, but also the majors?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, it's been cool.  Just been a pro for a year and a half and been able to see some really cool places.  Obviously being here earlier in the year, yeah, worked hard on my game and I feel I've made a lot of improvements, just looking at the last time I was here, which is really encouraging.
 If I can keep on progressing in my game, I'm pretty hopeful about the future.
 Q. I'm not sure if you've seen it but the European Tour re-Tweeted some coverage, Norwegian coverage of that winning putt last week.  Did you get to see that?  You must have a crazy reaction back home.
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, did I see that.  They also had a pretty good one from Puerto Rico earlier in the year, as well.  I know those guys a little bit, Henrik Bj√∏rnstad used to play a little bit on the European Tour and the PGA Tour and always looked up to him a little bit.  Per-Ulrik used to play out here as well, and I used to be up early in the morning watching the European Tour and he would always commentate.  It's kind of cool to see those guys have the reaction that they had for my winning putt.
 Q. About this week, though, DP World Tour Championship, this is where it all finishes and it's a massive week.  What would it mean to you to tick the box of your first European Tour win and here of all places?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   That would be incredible.  Just to think that I've always won twice on the PGA Tour, it's gone by so quick and it's been amazing, so I feel like that would be another box we can kind of tick off to win on The European Tour.  Obviously being Norwegian, it kind of feels closer to home, so that would be amazing.
