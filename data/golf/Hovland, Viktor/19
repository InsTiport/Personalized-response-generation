 Q.  If yesterday was a day to get some scoring in, was today a day to be a little bit more patient out there?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: I mean, I tried to do the same thing out there but it wasn't really happening. Hit a lot of greens really the whole day, but didn't have that many close looks, and the close ones that I had I just didn't make. Yeah, I just didn't really get a whole lot of momentum. Made two really nice birdies on -- is it 3 and 4 or 4 and 5, I think? Yeah, 4 and 5. Didn't make birdie on the par-5 6th, and gave one back on 8 and missed a short one on 9. If I would have kept going, I could have easily been two more birdies and then it's a 66 instead of a 69. It is what it is. A lot of good stuff. Some bad stuff that I need to figure out a little bit, and hopefully we can play good on the weekend.   
 Q.  You shot your round yesterday in the afternoon when the wind had picked up and it wasn't the calm conditions the guys had in the morning. What were the conditions like yesterday afternoon compared to this morning?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Really there was hardly any wind this morning. It was pure for scoring. I thought the greens had maybe gotten a little quicker than yesterday, so definitely -- I just felt like I had a lot of looks that broke a whole lot. Maybe the pins were a little tougher, I'm not sure. But yeah, I mean, if you're playing really good and making some putts, you can take it low today.   
 Q.  So the course is still scorable today?  
VIKTOR HOVLAND: Yeah, I'd say so.
