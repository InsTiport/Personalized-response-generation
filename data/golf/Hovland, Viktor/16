  Q. Viktor, how would you characterize your round?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Got off to a very nice start.  It was very tough out there, so I knew that around par was going to be a good score.  A little up and down.  I felt like I didn't do a very good job of when I was out of position just take kind of the punishment and get back in play.  I kind of tried to force a couple situations, so it cost me a couple shots there.  Other than that, I hit a lot of good shots and try to work on the not-so-good stuff tomorrow.
 Q. Did it feel like a U.S. Open out there at times?
 VIKTOR HOVLAND:   Yeah, for sure.  The greens are really firm and fast, and obviously with the wind it's really hard to hit fairways, and then you're just out of position from the get-go.
