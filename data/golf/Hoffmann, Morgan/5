Q. Nice start, a couple of 67s, 8-under par headed into the weekend.  What are your thoughts about the two days?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: I feel really good.  I had my coach come in, Gary Gilchrist, and I haven't seen him in a long time.  It was much needed, and had some good swing thoughts and got some really good work in before the tournament started, and it's paying off.
Q. I know it's not been the year you were looking for.  What have you been struggling with?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Just everything, really.  Some bad breaks and then more mental, I guess, kind of whiney out there instead of positive, and trying to turn that around now.
Q. You've been through the Playoffs before.  You know what it means to be there.  How much pressure does that add to you as you come down to the end of the regular season?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: You know, I try not to think about it.  Obviously it's there.  Probably thought about it this season a little too much, especially in the last few events, but you know, I love this course and I feel really comfortable out there this week, so just trying to tee it up.
