 Q.  Morgan, nicely done out there, especially that eagle on the 9th, the 26-footer there to post 7-under par.  How was today's round?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Thank you.  Yeah, it was good.  It was a lot of fun today.  Ready to start the year, and it's nice to be in Hawaii.   
 Q.  What are the players going to face on the golf course today, do you believe?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: The greens are not too firm.  They're rolling really well, and basically the scoring conditions, there are a couple of tough holes into the wind there on the front nine.  But other than that, the par-5s are pretty reachable today.   
 Q.  How did you spend your time during the short break?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Took some time off, three weeks off and went surfing and diving and just trying to take it easy and then practiced hard the last few weeks.   
 Q.  I know you like to prepare your own food.  Is it something easy for you to do here in Hawaii?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: No, it's not easy.  But the food is great around here, so it's nice to have some local food.   
 Q.  Great start.  Good luck the rest of the way.  First hole, rough start and then a nice finish?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah.  It was really weird.  I had a root like three inches high and I couldn't even advance it.  I hit it backwards.   
 Q.  Where is the root?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: So the hole is over here and the root -- so it's like that.  I had to hit it back that way.  No, it was a good bogey.   
 Q.  And you say it was a wedge coming in here?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah.   
 Q.  The rest of the day?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: The rest of the day was interesting.  It wasn't very consistent.  Just made a couple of long putts.   
Yeah, the greens are rolling really well.  It's nice.  Hopefully hit a little better tomorrow.   
 Q.  Where did your season end last year?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Well, 2015?   
 Q.  Well, yeah.  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Or '16?   
 Q.  When did you stop playing golf in the year of 2015?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Sea Island.   
 Q.  How many years?  This is your third year?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Fourth.   
 Q.  Does it feel like you've been out here that long?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: No.  I mean it's crazy.  Time flies.  I guess everybody would say the same thing.   
 Q.  When you look at goals for the year, are there any in your head or do you actually write them down?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: No.  They're in my head.  I don't write them down.   
 Q.  Have you ever written anything down?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah, of course.   
 Q.  I don't.  I'm just curious if some of the guys actually physically go through the process on the yellow legal pad.  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah.  I've gone through those dream boards and all that kind of stuff.  I put pictures up.  I'm kind of big into meditation and just kind of visualizing stuff.  So I try to do that often.   
 Q.  What did you set as a main goal this year?  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Just to have my attitude in check.  I don't really have any --   
 Q.  No result-related --  
MORGAN HOFFMANN: No results.  Yeah, if I keep my attitude in check and practice the way I should and we have a plan, I think everything should take care of itself.
