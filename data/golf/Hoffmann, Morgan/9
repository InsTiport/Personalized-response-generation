Q. 2 is a pretty good number.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah, it seemed like it was pretty difficult out there.  The wind sped the greens up little bit.  So it was tough.  You've got to really plot out this course.  There's some really difficult holes out there.  So I'm happy going into the next couple of days.
Q. How is the atmosphere?  You got the September, playoff atmosphere, how is it treating you out there?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: It was really cool playing with Keegan.  He has the home crowd out here this week.  It's great to have that kind of support for him.  Whenever the crowds are rowdy I think it's really cool.  It's nice.
Q. Thoughts going into tomorrow, another possibly tough day.  You're playing with Keegan again.  How do you feel?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Pretty good.  Just going to stick to my game plan and try to keep it simple.
Q. Another bubble guy, you know you've got to finish really good here to kind of move your way up to The TOUR Championship?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah, absolutely.  Just going to take one shot at a time.
