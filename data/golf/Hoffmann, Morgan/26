Q.   Good start for you.   I know you're not happy with No. 8.   You had a terrible lie over there.   But all in all a good day for you. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Thanks.   I worked on my game hard.

Q.   How is the putting right now, because I like the way you putt, you stand straight up.   I know you've been working hard on it, is it a level now where you're happy with it?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, I'm really happy with my putting. 

Q.   You've got to feel like your game is real close to winning.   You've got a lot of game. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I'm not thinking about that.   I'm trying to get better, not focused on everybody else.   And just trying to hit shots and focus on target.

Q.   Are you following your Cowboys on the NCAA tournament?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I'm trying to.

Q.   What about against Gonzaga, that's a tough game, isn't it?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I think they're the sleeper this year.   It should be a good time. 

Q.   You're a Marcus Smart fan?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yes.

Q.   You both have the same sort of moxie, do you think?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   He's a good dude.

Q.   Take me through real quick the stretch, you really got it going on 16, 17 and then 1 and 2.   Take me through those holes. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, I was feeling good all day.   And didn't really make any birdies.   And that eagle was nice.   Then started trusting my swing.   My speed was getting better.   That's what really helped.

Q.   Take me through the 16th hole, what did you do there to get the eagle, what club?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   16 I hit driver, 8â€‘iron to just 20, 25 feet.   And made that.

Q.   All right. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   And 17 to three feet. 

Q.   And then 1 and 2?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   1 I hit to like four feet. 
And 2 I chipped in from just off the fringe.
