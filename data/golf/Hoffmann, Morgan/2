Q. Overall thoughts on the day?  Was there any thought ongoing for it on 18?
MORGAN HOFFMAN: No, it was just too far.  I blocked it off the tee.  It was pretty frustrating.  But I hit a great third shot in there and had a really easy putt and hit it right by.
Q. What do four rounds in the 60s do for your confidence?
MORGAN HOFFMAN: It was a great week, obviously the best I've had all year.  Working really hard.  I have a lot of confidence going forward.
Q. What do you feel like changed this week?
MORGAN HOFFMAN: Just sticking with the same routine every shot.  Slowing down a little bit and seeing the shots and trusting it.  It was nice.
Q. Not some where you play all the time, but pretty comfortable being around home and staying at home?
MORGAN HOFFMAN: Yeah, it's awesome.  Staying in my own bed, is great.
