Q.   Did you ever envision this? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, absolutely.   I was really‑‑ what's the word, I had no clue what was going on when I first turned pro in college.   I thought I could get a sponsor's exemption into The Barclays, and that wasn't the case. 
But ever since then, I was like, all right, I've got to get into that event and made it pretty much on the number this year.   So it was really exciting to finish the way I did.

Q.   Did you get used to everybody shouting your name and the Jersey chants?   What was it like? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I'd like to get used to that.   That would be awesome.   But no, it was so cool.   Seriously this is the coolest experience I've ever had.

Q.   You had a front row seat to Mahan.   How would you describe the way he played today? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Just consistent, plodded along and made birdies where he needed to and didn't make mistakes.   He's a consistent player.   It's good to see.

Q.   What does that teach you when you see him have a round like that under that kind of condition? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, it's great.   I've played with him a bunch and he's a great guy.   We have similar games in some aspects but it's really cool to play with him and watch that happen. 

Q.   You talked about coming in almost on the number this week and now you have a bit of that pressure off.   What does do for you the next couple weeks? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   It's great.   I have no idea what I'm going to finish on the FedExCup or whatever but hopefully it moves me into next week and go along from there. 

Q.   Did it enter your mind at all‑‑
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Not really.   I was just trying to play as aggressive as possible like I said I was going to and that's really where my focus was.   I had a good mind‑set today.   My swing wasn't really working on the irons.
