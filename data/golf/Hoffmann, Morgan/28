Q.   Talk about your start today.   Good start?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah.   I was just telling my caddy, Ryan, and my girlfriend it's nice to play golf again.   Two weeks off, feels like forever.   Just playing so many weeks in a row out here and taking two weeks off is kind of a little different and feels great to get back on the course.

Q.   What did you do on your off time?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Went to the beach, relaxed and I went up and had Scott Langley's bachelor party in Chicago.   Nice, had some fun and played some golf, Olympia Fields which is a great course.

Q.   What was the key to your round today?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I drove it well and then my putting was good.   Comfortable on these greens and it's nice to have a fast greens.   I like them.

Q.   With The Barclays next week did you grow up near Liberty National?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   About 20 miles away.

Q.   You've played it?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I haven't played it since it's new.   I haven't gotten home in the last few years.

Q.   Chomping at the bit for next week, though?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I'm excited.   I can't wait.
