Q. What were you finding that was going right for you today?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: You know, just trying to stay in the routine, and coming into this week, I haven't been playing that well, and just really wanted to stick to a routine coming into each shot.  My caddie and I did that really well today, and that's what was kind of keeping the pace for me.
Q. How did you assess the scoring conditions today?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: They were tougher, I think, tonight.  The greens got kind of firm.  They got bumpy, too.  But the fairways are great, and the greens will roll true in the morning, so looking forward to the morning.
Q. Talking about the state of your game right now, what are the things that you're working on?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: As I said, just working on a routine consistently, and working on kind of like an impact position, just like kind of a drill through impact that I can feel solid every time.
Q. Goals for the weekend?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah, just trying to stay patient and stick to my plan.
Q. And then looking forward to the rest of the season, what season goals do you have?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: You know, it's really kind of a mentality attitude kind of thing.  I don't really have any set goals to be like win five times or something like that.  I think if I stay very patient and even minded, I think that I could have a good year.
