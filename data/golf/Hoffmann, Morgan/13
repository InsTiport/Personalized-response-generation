Q.   Morgan you were right there.   Describe the tee shot on 18. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I was missed the putt on 17.   I knew I needed to make birdie birdie and had some people that were pretty into it just yelling and taking pictures and so its unfortunate but shouldn't have distracted me.   I'm not going to make that as an excuse.   Just was pretty mad about missing the putt on 17.

Q.   Henrik said you were on the clock on 15.   Did that affect you on 15 and 16 a little bit?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   With the speed of the greens on the backside they're a lot quicker and firmer and then trying to get the speed and the lines while being rushed is kind of unfortunate but we were playing so I guess --

Q.   What can you take away from this week?   You played well all week.
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah.   Up until the last 9, it was pretty good.   Just grind on the next two weeks until the Masters and hope we have a good finish there.
