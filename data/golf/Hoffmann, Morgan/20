  > Q.  Here with Morgan Hoffmann who birdied the final two holes, 17 and 18, to jump inside the number for now at 68 which will get you a spot at the BMW Championship.  Walk us through those final two holes and everything that was going through your mind.  MORGAN HOFFMANN: I was playing good all day.  I just had a couple of bad holes, two doubles on the front side.  I just had to stay positive.  I birdied the last two, and put myself in good positions off the tee and thankfully pulled it off.   Q.  It's been an interesting couple of weeks for you.  You snuck into the playoffs.  And then top-10 in the Barclays, which got you here.  And now you have a chance to move on to the next one.  You've had to basically fight your way into the next week every event in the playoffs and even the one before.  What do you have to do in your mind to prepare for something like that?  MORGAN HOFFMANN: It's been a fun ride.  I kind of -- my caddie and I talked a lot about it before coming into the playoffs, after we snuck in there after the Wyndham.  And I went back to my college days mentality, just freewheeling it, having fun, not really looking at the scoreboards, just going out and playing my game and playing aggressive, which I like to do.
