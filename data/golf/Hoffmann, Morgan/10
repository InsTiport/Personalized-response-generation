Q. Great number that you posted out there. Five birdies and one eagle. No bogies on your card. Great performance that you gave.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: It was great today. You know, I kind of came in this week with a new attitude, trying to hit the middle of the greens. My stats this year are pretty pathetic, pretty much dead last in greens hit. My goal was just to hit to the middle of every green and see what happens. It went well.

Q. You're safely inside the FedExCup. I want to go back to last year, you missed the cut. You needed to sweat it out to see if you made The Playoffs. Each week you took advantage and made it all the way to the Tour Championship by just squeaking in. 
When you went home for the Wyndham Championship on the weekend how difficult was that period of waiting to see what happens?
MORGAN HOFFMANN: You know, I kind of -- it was obviously a moment of frustration and anger and hoping at the same time and I kind of just let it go and it wasn't up to me anymore. The guys played and finished and thankfully I slipped in and kind of a new life.

Q. Morgan, five birdies and an eagle. That's the way to play in the 1st Round of this tournament. Way to go.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Thanks. I'll take it for sure. 

Q. Tell us about the eagle at the 15th.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: I hit a good drive on the left side of the fairway. It's always nice to get lift, clean and place and put yourself in a good lie coming to the par 5. I took advantage of it and got a good read on the downhill putt and poured it in there from 20 feet.

Q. Great job on the 9th as well. Not an easy putt no matter how far it is from the hole when you're above the hole here at the 9th green.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: That green gets really quick out here later in the day. These greens are some of the best on Tour. Keeps me going --

Q.  Great playing, keep it going.
MORGAN HOFFMANN: Thanks a lot.
