Q.   Morgan, great day for you out there. 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, it was great.   I give a lot of credit to playing or Oklahoma State in preparing for this wind out there.   It's a tough course and Carson Creek is just like this, so I felt pretty good about today. 

Q.   How bad was it out there? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   It was really tough.   There were some shots you had no idea how much the ball was going to take‑‑ how much the wind was going to take it, and it was really difficult. 

Q.   How did you feel when you started moving up, could you feel that? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I felt that, I stuck it on the front nine, I misread some putts and missed some greens, and it could have been 4 or 5 lower today but I'm happy. 

Q.   Ball striking was good today? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Ball striking was good. 

Q.   How about the whole week with regards to ball striking? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   The ball striking was great the whole week.   The first two days I literally didn't make one putt. 
I switched putters after the second day, so it worked out after that. 

Q.   What did you switch to?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   My old trusty that I've used for four years. 

Q.   What's that?
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Newport, Scotty Cameron. 

Q.   What did you have before? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   The first two days a GoLo, Scotty Cameron. 

Q.   Last time you were in town you secured your card.   Is the season going the way you wanted it to at this point? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I had a really slow start.   It's tough with the reshuffles this season because it's a shorter season, and you had to play good the first four weeks, which I didn't, so it was difficult to get into events. 
I've learned a lot out here this year, and I think the finish will be good. 

Q.   This tournament will help you out a lot and you've had a good finish or two in the past, right? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, I switched caddies and everything has been going great.   I had a lot of great people around me so good vibes the whole way. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Yeah, I wasn't in next week so this event will be huge. 

Q.   What's next for you after that? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Well on Monday I have the British Open qualifier, tomorrow, and Colonial next week and hopefully Memorial. 

Q.   You haven't played Colonial before.   Have you played at the golf course? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I haven't.   I heard great things, though.

Q.   From who? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   All the players. 

Q.   Where are you living now? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I live in Jupiter, Florida. 

Q.   And that's because of practice or what? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   Pretty much.   I love the area. 

Q.   Did you get the chance to meet with Ken Venturi?   Do you have any stories about him? 
MORGAN HOFFMANN:   I've never met him, but I've heard a lot of awesome stories, like he was drafted out of high school to the Yankees.   He's a great athlete and it's cool to have good athletes on the PGA TOUR, so I try to shape my life around being a great athlete.
