 Q. 3-under 68 today.  What's working well for you so far in the tournament?MORGAN HOFFMANN: Well, I switched back to my old trusty putter.  So that's really brought some confidence back out, and just trying to hit the middle of the greens and keep it simple out there.
Q. Now you've played well here in the past.  What is it about these older-type of courses that brings the best out of you?MORGAN HOFFMANN: I can read the greens pretty well because I grew up on this kind of grass, and just same around the rough, too, and when I'm hitting chip shots.  So it's pretty easy to read for me.
Q. Was there any noticeable difference playing in the afternoon yesterday compared to the morning today?MORGAN HOFFMANN: The greens were much smoother in the morning, but you know, they are pretty good all day.  But other than that, there's no wind this morning and yesterday was pretty breezy.
Q. Going into tomorrow, finishing early, you're minus four, what are your thoughts going into tomorrow and your position?MORGAN HOFFMANN: Yeah, just try to keep it simple out there and have some fun.  I think I have a great game plan for the course.  Other than that, you know, just go out and stick to my plan.
