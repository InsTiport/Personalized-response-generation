  Q. Talk about playing with Tom today.   
 TREVOR DODDS: It was great playing with tomorrow and I thoroughly enjoyed just being back in the mix of competition. And I had a few bad holes, but to finish with an eagle the way I did was awesome.   
  
  Q. How long was that putt on 18?  
 TREVOR DODDS: It was four paces, so what, 12 feet.   
  
  Q. Do you have any idea when your next golf will be?  
 TREVOR DODDS: I'm hoping next week. I got to go qualify for next week I hope I get in there.   
  
  Q. Is that Monday or Tuesday?  
 TREVOR DODDS: Tuesday.   
  
  Q. Okay.   
 TREVOR DODDS: So I hope I get in.   
  
  Q. I was going to ask early in the round on the front nine you had climbed the leaderboard enough and the leaders had comeback, did you realize that you were on top there for a hole?  
 TREVOR DODDS: I knew it was going to be somewhere between 8 and 10 is where the number was going to be. You kind of know that starting out.   
 So I wasn't too concerned with it. I just made a bad mistake at nine and then on 17 I just got a really bad break. I made double there. But in a way that probably motivated me to make eagle on the last hole. It is what it is, it's golf.
