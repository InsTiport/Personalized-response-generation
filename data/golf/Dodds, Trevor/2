 Q. Would you talk a little bit about today and how you feel about it? 
 TREVOR DODDS: Well, I managed my game pretty well today. I hit a lot of greens, which was key, made key birdies on -- what did I shoot, 1-under and 2-under on two different nines. I just played solid. I didn't get myself into trouble, drove the ball pretty solid, so it was a good day all in all.

 Q. Are you looking towards tomorrow yet?
 TREVOR DODDS: No, tomorrow will have enough problems of its own. We'll worry about that tomorrow. Right now I'm thinking about food.
