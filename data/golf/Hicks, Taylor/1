   TAYLOR HICKS:  I'm good.  I'm happy.  I had a great time.  You know, I mean, being with the LPGA and being out there with Angela Stafford and all the girls was a thrill for me.  My first and hopefully not my last LPGA event.   
 THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Taylor?   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
TAYLOR HICKS:  I think this is the best group that I've ever played with.  We rotated each great shot with each other, which is a -- which was really cool.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Maybe one or two out there.  That's what I'm good for, I think, is a long drive here and there.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  No, no, no, she gave me some pointers.  She gave me some green reads.  Played a couple of putts with her and she's obviously a great athlete.  You can tell by the she strikes the ball.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  You know, try to think centered, think in the middle, don't think out of bounds, which was good, because after that I hit a pretty good drive.  She lined me up some great putts.   
 THE MODERATOR:  You played at Ross Bridge with the Regency charity Classic.  How does the course here differ from that?   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, you know, it's -- I think out here you really got to place your drives.  Target golf out here is the key.  That's kind of tough for an amateur like me sometimes to get out there and try to place my drives.   
 But we had a great day on the course and, you know, it's definitely enjoyable.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  I started playing golf when I was probably about eight or nine years old out at the Grayson Valle Country Club in Birmingham.  Home of Charley Boswell's home course.   
 You know, I really remember the great story that he has.  As a kid, yeah, I'd always heard stories and sometimes I would see him out on the course walking around.  They would strike the ball amazingly well.   
 That's kind of one of the reasons why I guess I picked up the game, too, was because I just thought it was -- I had fun when I got the ball finally up in the air I thought, I'm not going to give this sport up.   
 THE MODERATOR: :  Any other questions?   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, you know, I don't think that I'm there yet.  I need a couple of more albums, but this is -- what a wonderful lifestyle to be able to be on a golf tour of any sorts.  I get out and try to play when I can, but I'm a working musician and always will be.   
 I don't definitely see myself as a working golfer anytime soon, but I would, you know, any time I get a chance to play and do those charity events and Pro-Ams I do for the cause.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Never had a hole in one.  You know, I guess I could be like 99% of the population and say that I've come close, but not one that's actually gone in the hole.  I had one about eight feet today on a Par 3, which was close.   
 Yeah.  Getting there.  Slow and steady wins the race with these things.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, I've done -- you know, I did the Oxmoor Valley, Robert Trent Jones down there in Auburn.  I think the Trail a very unique to Alabama.  I think we're very proud of the Trail.  I've been in planes and traveling around the country and, you know, one of the things that come up in conversation is -- you know, when I talk about my home state one of them is like, I've played the Trail before.  So the Trail is a definite unique part of Alabama's culture.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, you know, I love it.  I just like being out there with the girls, you know.  (Laughter) that's always fun.  So that's definitely a plus.  And we've had a wonderful day today.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Of course I would.  I would love to come back.  Yeah, it's a great course.   
 THE MODERATOR:  You have an open invitation.   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Great.  Open invitations for life.  Trail card for life.  I'd love that.  I'd like to play the Judge.  So I've got the senator, but I haven't played the Judge.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, I will be in Pennsylvania this weekend and then I'm doing the Big E, which is the country's biggest state fair up in the Boston area Saturday night, which will be fun.   
 Few one-off gigs here and there, few performance appearances here and there, but I'm in the creative process right now writing my second record and releasing it next year.  I'm a touring musician and always have been, so that's kind of how things are going to go.  Get back out on tour and performing as many places as I can with the next record.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, I'm definitely interested in -- until those things really get set in stone you're not really supposed to talk about them.  We'll see what happens.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Yeah, I have.  I'm excited about that, too.  Yeah, it's really nice.  I used to play a little restaurant in the docks up there.  Yeah, that's a very nice area up in North Alabama.  I was up there playing before the American Idol win, so...   
 I'd like to get back there but I got a little music left in me.  I'm not into regular retirement homes just yet.  There is a retreat somewhere in Alabama so I'm happy about that.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Right.  Well, you know, I'm going to have to put some music together.  I'm still in the process of winding this record down.  The affairs that I have and engagements that I've got coming up in the next couple months, after that's over with I'll have time to regroup and put the creative process in the works and start writing the next record.   
 I got a DVD coming out this fall.  It's called Whomp at the Warfield.  I'm looking toward forward to that.  That's on HD Net on October 7th:   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, I think I did a million plus.  You know, and I had a platinum album for that so I was pretty excited to hear that.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Well, I don't know.  We'll have to see.  We'll have to see if that footage pops up somewhere.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 TAYLOR HICKS:  Yeah, that's a good look.   
 THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
