Q. Best round of the year.
JACQUI COCOLINO: Yes, yeah.
Q. What went well?
JACQUI COCOLINO: Mentally stayed stable.  Hit a couple loose ones, but you're going to.  And then dropped a couple bombs, to, so...
Q. How do you like this course?
JACQUI COCOLINO: I love this place.  The energy is great, the fans.  I have a great group of friends here that came out and watched all day.  It's nice to have that support.  If you're not playing well or if you are playing well you can feed off it and pick yourself up.
Q. Yeah, how big is that for you to feel like you have that support coming from maybe outside the ropes?
JACQUI COCOLINO: Yeah, no, it's great.  I absolutely love it.  The whole Sportsman's Grill here and the whole crew, it's been really neat.  My fan base keeps growing here.  The Allied Group and my pro-am yesterday; had a bunch of guys out here today.  It was a blast.
Q. How has your season been going so far?  How would you assess it?
JACQUI COCOLINO: Flashes of brilliance and then some not-so-good stuff.  It's golf.  Ebbs and flows; you're going to go through it.  You just have to make sure you keep plugging along and stick to the process, whatever that is for you.
Q. Is there anything that you've been working on maybe that you saw today?
JACQUI COCOLINO: Just working on some setup stuff and just trying to commit to my targets and the ball flight I'm trying to hit.
If it happens, it happens.  If not, go to the next one.
Q. You seem pretty good about shaking off whether it's a missed cut or a bad round.  Is that just a fact of your game, mental state?
JACQUI COCOLINO: Yeah, I don't know.  You know, you just keep saying like it's golf.  You're going to have bad weeks.  We're human, you know.  You just have to know it's a long season and you're going to play good at some point, you're going to get hot.
So waiting out for that moment and then feeding off it.
Q. How nice was it to get hot today?
JACQUI COCOLINO: It was nice to get hot.  Hopefully I can feed off it for the rest of the week.
