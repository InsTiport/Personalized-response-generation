PAUL ROVNAK:  Jill, thanks for coming in and speaking with us.  We appreciate it.
JILL McGILL: 
Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  36 holes today, that is a lot of golf.  Before we take questions, let's go over your scorecard of the final round.
JILL McGILL: 
The morning was much more exciting.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
You birdied No. 1 in the final round.
JILL McGILL: 
Yep, I hit a 4 iron to six feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Bogey on 2.
JILL McGILL: 
I missed a duplicate.  Probably would have been my footprints from this morning in that bunker on the right.  I hit it to about ten feet and missed it.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Bogey on 6.
JILL McGILL: 
I came up on the front of the green and I hit what I thought was a pretty good first putt.  My comeback was where I wanted it.  It was just a misread.  I hit it to the right.  That was the 9 iron.  My first putt was 30 feet, my second one was three feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Bogey on eight.
JILL McGILL: 
I hit a 6 iron left of the green and then awful chip to about ten feet, and just hit an awful putt.  It was just awful.  It was a bad hole.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Then you came back.
JILL McGILL: 
Actually during that stretch I think the 36 was getting to me, just my concentration and my focus.  I wasn't able to zone in on what I was trying to do.  I kind of regrouped after that, ate some more food, tried to drink a lot of water.

Anyway, that is what I am blaming it on.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Birdie on 11, so it must have worked.
JILL McGILL: 
Yeah.  I hit a 9 iron to ten feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
14.
JILL McGILL: 
That was a 9 iron also to about 20 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Bogey on 17.
JILL McGILL: 
Hit a bad swing with a 6 iron and my ball was kind of down in the grass.  I couldn't tell what it was going to do, I was expecting it to jump a little bit more and hit my pitch to probably, I don't know, 15 feet and just misread the putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
This is a great finish for you.  Talk about that.
JILL McGILL: 
Yeah, I am really pleased.  I had a good week last week.  I was trying to build off that.  My putting is coming around.  I don't know how many putts I had this afternoon.  I think it was my first three putt on No. 6 of the week, and that is something that I am really working on.  I just am getting more confidence, having a lot more fun on the golf course.  It makes it easier to go out and try to hit good shots instead of hoping to get good shots.  Just take the runs and whatever comes your way unless you are trying to do what you are trying to do.

I am really pleased with the way I played.  I know I can probably hit a couple more iron shots closer.  They weren't that great this week.  But I made a lot of putts.  I chipped in three times.  So, I am not going to complain too much.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
We'll take questions.
Q.  The Spiderman Band Aid, what is that?  Is that any special significance there?
JILL McGILL: 
A friend told me maybe I should wear it and that if anything ever starts going astray, to look down and laugh and realize that things aren't that bad.  So maybe I will have to make it a habit for me.

When I was choosing between Dora, Barbie and Spidey, I thought Spidey was best.
Q.  Dora?
JILL McGILL: 
You never seen the cartoon, "Dora the Explorer."
Q.
Is all of this recently make you feel like you are closer to winning?
JILL McGILL: 
Yeah, I do.  I think I held in there pretty well today.  I think the conditions were very difficult.  You know, it was a very trying day, and my focus was a lot better.  I was getting tunnel vision, which I struggled with throughout my career, and just being able to relax a little bit more over the shots.

Although I bogeyed 17, I think I have a sneaky suspicion of where I was.  I tried to block out everything else.  My caddy is great.  He has been on the bag since Vegas, however many tournaments that is.  I just talked about my goals for the last five holes regardless of what the outcome in the tournament may have been.
Q.  Do you just get the feeling like if anybody could have put a little pressure on Cristie maybe something happens?
JILL McGILL: 
 Yes.
Q.  Nobody was in a block's range of her.
JILL McGILL: 
Cristie is a great player.  You don't expect Cristie to make mistakes.  Who knows, if you do apply a bit of pressure.

That pin is hard to get to on the 18th hole.  If some players feel as though they need to play aggressive, it could be challenging.  16 and 17, those pins are pretty accessible.  So, you know, Dylan and I talked about that and said, "Let's make a couple of birdies and put a little pressure on her."  Not expecting her to fold but it would have been a lot more fun.
Q.  Dylan being your caddy?
JILL McGILL: 
Yeah.
Q.  Can you spell his name for us.
JILL McGILL: 
D y l a n V a l a q u e t t e.
Q.  Where did he come from?
JILL McGILL: 
A friend of mine who caddies on the PGA Tour knew him from out there, and he is from around Albany, New York but he was working out for Roger Tambellini on the PGA Tour.  He is a USC guy, and he was with Jason Buha before that.

So it seems to be working out pretty well.
Q.  Did you take a look at the leaderboard at any point and say, "Kerr is still at whatever under.  She is not giving it up today"?
JILL McGILL: 
I didn't do it.  I didn't really look at the board.  I got a glimpse after or before I birdied 14.  I caught a glimpse.  I didn't see where I was, and I knew where I was in relation to her.  I didn't know anything else in the field.

So she played great golf.  She is 2 under on the day for 36.  The conditions were really difficult.  So, you know, it is just one of those things.  She is in the zone, probably and making a lot of putts and a lots of good shots.
PAUL ROVNAK:  
Thanks, Jill.
