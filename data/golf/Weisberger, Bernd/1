 Q.   You must be delighted with your position?  
BERND WEISBERGER:   Yeah, I'm very pleased with my playing.   I've had a couple hiccups during the round.   I had to scramble well.   I putted beautifully again as I did yesterday.   I'm quite delighted with my play so far.   
   
 Q.   How is the course playing out there?   Was it tougher today?   
BERND WEISBERGER:   The breeze was up maybe just a little bit but obviously it was much softer than yesterday and maybe a couple tricky pins than yesterday.   It played quite challenging, but hit really good shots and converted.   The course did play fair, so I think it was the right decision, as well, to play the ball down.  
   
 Q.   How do you rate your first two rounds compared to other performances in majors?   
BERND WEISBERGER:   Well, it's a different level for me.   I've in the been very successful in the Majors so far.   It's my sixth one and only one cut so far, so it's disappointing how I've played in the majors.   
Yeah, I had good preparation coming into this week.   I had a couple weeks off and came here early and had a good look at the course.   I've really enjoyed being here so far, and I think it shows in my play the first two days.
