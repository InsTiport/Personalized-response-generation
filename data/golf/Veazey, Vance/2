   VANCE VEAZEY: Ball striking was a little bit sketchy but the golf course, like I said all week, you have to control your ball and if you don't, you're going to shoot over-par. I shot 1-over today which is not the end of the world. I wish I could have gone out today and shot four, 5-under. Hopefully tomorrow will be the day.

 Q. Feel pretty confident going into tomorrow?
 VANCE VEAZEY: I'm glad to be at home with family and friends. I want to play well for them. See what happens tomorrow and hopefully hit a little bit better and make some putts.

 Q. Some low numbers out there.
 VANCE VEAZEY: It can be done but you have to be on your toes out here. This golf course can eat your lunch. Hopefully, like I said, tomorrow I'll get off to a good start. Get the front side, get it going and you just hit good shots.

 Q. Big difference in the course today after the rain yesterday?
 VANCE VEAZEY: Definitely much slower today. The ball wasn't going as far but, you know, the wind was down a little bit so that helped. But it's still a tough golf course.

 Q. Getting out there pretty early tomorrow. 
 VANCE VEAZEY: I think we're going off at 7:30 and 9:30. Be good to hopefully beat some wind and have some good low scores.
