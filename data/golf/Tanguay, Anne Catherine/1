 Q.  Does that make a difference when you're just having fun out there and playing free golf?  
ANNE CATHERINE TANGUAY: Yeah.  Definitely does.  It's easier said than done.  Gotta have a few years of practice to kind of really understand what it is and how you can do that.   
 Q.  What did you learn about your game out here?  Any doubt in your mind you can compete with these girls out here?  
ANNE CATHERINE TANGUAY: No doubt.  No doubt.  I feel really great about my game.  I think this week I just managed my mistakes a little better, and I think it was the goal this week.  Just wish I could have given myself a few more chances today, but I mean I'm still happy with my week, and I can't -- you know, I'm really happy.   
 Q.  Where do you go from here?  
ANNE CATHERINE TANGUAY: I go home.  I'll go home for a week and then play a few more Symetra events for the rest of the year and probably go back to third stage.  But you know, I'm feeling really good about it, so it was great confidence booster of a week.   
 Q.  Given the crowds that we've seen here this week, what can you say about the growth of women's golf in Canada?  
ANNE CATHERINE TANGUAY: I mean I think it's booming, and especially with Brooke, Alena and the Canadian national team has -- the program's been doing so much for women's golf and young girls, too.  So I think it's getting there, and we've seen so many young girls out here this week and throughout this season, too, and it's so good to see that we can help grow the game.   
 Q.  Do you think you inspired any young golfers this week?  
ANNE CATHERINE TANGUAY: I hope so.  I really hope so.  I did my best, and just had some fun, so yeah.
