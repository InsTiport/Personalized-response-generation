  Q. Tim, excellent round today. A little more attention with Gavin in the group. Seemed like a little bigger gallery than you might be used to in this kind of event. You must feel good about how you're playing.   
 TIM WILKINSON: I played solid. It was good. The gallery was fun. It was a good gallery. I've played in front of a lot bigger.   
 But it's fun. It's always nice to have people out there, and obviously they were supporting Gavin, and he's a good young player.  
  
  Q. What did you think of his round?  
 TIM WILKINSON: You know, I think he had a little bit of adrenaline going early on. He hit it over a few greens, but after that he played really well. Shows how much talent he has, so it was really impressive.  
  
  Q. Do you remember the first time you played professionally, what that was like for you?  
 TIM WILKINSON: Yeah. I was about 19, I think, so four years later than Gavin.   
 He's a good player, so has a good future.  
  
  Q. And you played pretty well. There was a lot of people out there, and you --  
 TIM WILKINSON: Yeah. I played solid. You know, I got injured last year, and I really haven't played that well since I got injured.   
 I had surgery on my thumb. I haven't major medical this year and I Monday qualified here.   
  
  Q. What did you shoot today?  
 TIM WILKINSON: 67. But yeah, other than that, I mean it's good to come back. Takes a little bit of time to gain confidence, and yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you say anything to Gavin out there? Did you kind of feel like you were rooting for him?  
 TIM WILKINSON: Yeah. Definitely. It's hard watching someone that's a little bit nervous on the first few holes, and it's a little bit hard.   
 But as long as he has fun and learns from it. He's got a big future in front of him. He's got a good game.
