Q.   Talk about what was going good for you today. 
TIM WILKINSON:   Short game was good.   Hit some nice short irons.   Short game was good.   Few 6‑foot, 7‑foot birdie putts early in the round that got me going and I had some good up and downs, good one on 15, good on 16 and 17, great up and down, yeah, so short game kept me in it.   I hit a lot of good shots as well as.   I don't know how many greens I hit, but quite a few.   I was in play the whole time. 

Q.   The wind seemed to come up as the morning wave was finishing and then it calmed down a little? 
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah, on the third hole, was waiting for Brooks to hit and when it was my turn I went up two clubs.

Q.   Really?
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah, because it was down wind.   Off the left, it felt like.   And then within 30 seconds it was off to the left.   So it was tricky, a little bit, judging the wind and seeing where it was coming from.   Seemed like it was switching some? 

Q.   Gotta be happy going into tomorrow morning?   Better conditions?
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah, nice and calm.   We don't have to get up too early, so reasonably warm, yeah.
