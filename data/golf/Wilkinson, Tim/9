 Q.   Talk about your round today?  
TIM WILKINSON:   I drove it well the last two or three holes.   I played well today.   I don't know, it's hard to say.   I didn't make any putts really today.   I couldn't get it to the hole today.   I left myself under the hole in good spots, I just couldn't hit them hard enough.   
I played well, I just hit a couple of bad long irons in the wrong spot.   On number 5, number 10, actually I thought I hit a really nice shot and it‑‑ wind was off the right and it started fading and I don't know if I had something on my ball or what, but I felt like I hit a good shot and the wind got it and then I made bogey there.   
Then I had a bad lie on No. 12, but other than that‑‑  
   
 Q.   Were the conditions okay?   It was all four days were tough.   
TIM WILKINSON:   It wasn't bad today.   It's pretty good after the last two days, so.   It was scorable out there.   You just have to really play some of the holes 8, 9, 10, a little better.   Other than that, it wasn't too bad.  
   
 Q.   Does it make any difference playing in the last group like that?  
TIM WILKINSON:   I was actually really comfortable today.   I've done it twice now.   I played final pairing with K.J. Choi on Sunday in Hawaii, and then with Brian Gay at Hilton Head, and then today.   So I was comfortable today.   I wasn't nervous.   So I thought I would play well, I just didn't get the momentum going early.  
   
 Q.   How about Jimmy today?  
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah, he played really solidly.   And then he hit it over the green on 12, really should have birdied 14, and then you know, he played well.   He made it more interesting than it probably should have been.   But he got the job done and good for him.
