Q.   Tim, quite a round. 
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   Just get some comments. 
TIM WILKINSON:   Started off with a shitty driveon ‑ you can't put thatin ‑ a bad drive on the 1st, and then made a good up and down for par. 
Pulled my second one‑ I keep thinking the opposite way round‑ on 2.   Bogey there. 
I never made three birdies in a row.
Pretty good shot into the par‑3 about ten feet and made that. 
Then similar distance on the next hole. 
And similar distance on the next hole. 
So made three good putts there.
Then 3‑putted No. 5, I think it is.

Q.   6. 
TIM WILKINSON:   6, is it? 

Q.   Yeah. 
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah.   My first putt‑‑ sometimes it's hard to read the speed out here. 
I had a nice birdie on the par‑5, 6 points or something.

Q.   Then it got really good. 
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah.   Then I made five birdies in a row.   I made a nice putt on 10 about 20 about feet; five‑footer, six‑footer on‑‑ I skipped a hole.   Probably 15 feet down the hill on‑‑ 15, 18 feet on the par‑3, and then made a five‑footer. 
Made a really good up and down just short right of the green.   Not of the green, the bunker on what is it, 13?   Hit to about four or five feet and made that. 
Almost holed it I think on the par‑4.   (Indiscernible) 40, 50 feet and two‑putted that.   Putted pretty solid today still coming in. 

Q.   Miss any chances coming in?
TIM WILKINSON:   Just the one on the last hole.   Yeah, other than that, I played well, putted well.

Q.   This golf course obviously suited you today.   How do you like it?
TIM WILKINSON:   Yeah, I like it.   It's a little softer than it has been. 

Q.   Right. 
TIM WILKINSON:   But it's‑‑ I enjoy it out there.   Good scenery. 

Q.   First time here?
TIM WILKINSON:   No.   I've been here two other times, I think.

Q.   Has it been a while then?
TIM WILKINSON:   My first year was '08, and then 2010.   Played all right in '08, I think.   I missed the cut (indiscernible.) 
It's nice to get a whole lot of points this morning.   It can get a bit gusty in the afternoons and a bit trickier.
It was calm this morning, and it's good to get a whole lot of points under your belt early.

Q.   Speaking of the other points, just a couple weeks left in the regular season.   Goals in terms of the FedExCup?
TIM WILKINSON:   Obviously pushing inside of the top 100.   There is not as many this week.   You need a good finish.   Top 100 would be good. 
Week off, and then I'll play the Wyndham, Barclays.   Deutchebank.

Q.   There you go.   Win that 10 million at the end. 
TIM WILKINSON:   It's just about taking it just as it comes really.
