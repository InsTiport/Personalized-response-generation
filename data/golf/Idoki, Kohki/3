Q.   As defending champion, you'll now be here on the weekend after finishing with two birdies.   What are your overall thoughts on the day?
KOHKI IDOKI:   I made a double bogey, so after I end up hitting for double bogey on No. 6, I knew that I had to make, I had to have two birdies and hole number 7, it's hard to make birdie on that hole, so I had to have my momentum going on for number 8 and No. 9 to make a birdie and I did it, so I satisfied with the result, even though I had a double bogey on No. 6. 
So my first goal is to make the cut, no matter what, so I'm satisfied that I'm able to play for the weekend.   So I'm happy with that. 

Q.   How long were your putts on the last two holes, the birdies?
KOHKI IDOKI:   One meter and a half and then the last birdie that I made was one meter. 

Q.   Did you feel any extra pressure as the defending champion?
KOHKI IDOKI:   I felt so much pressure just because as the defending champion, I just had so many people expecting me to do much better. 

Q.   What was the feeling you had when the putt went in on 9?
KOHKI IDOKI:   When I had my address, my hand was shaking a little.   So then I was happy that it went in. 

Q.   What is your mentality now heading into the weekend?
KOHKI IDOKI:   Since I made the cut from here I want to aim a little higher goal to make it to top‑10 or top‑5. 

Q.   What are your overall thoughts on the course itself and the conditions?
KOHKI IDOKI:   I told you guys this already, but I just can't relax on this course, like from tee box to second shot and third shot and putting, I just have to concentrate a hundred percent on this course the whole time.
