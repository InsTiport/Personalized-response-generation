Q.   Just tell me a little bit about your preparations, being the past champion for this event. 
KOHKI IDOKI:   I prepared my body, so I skipped the last tournament, so I could prepare for this tournament as the defending champion.   But I felt pressure and I guess I couldn't defend the pressure that I had. 

Q.   Tell me a little bit about your round today. 
KOHKI IDOKI:   The first nine holes, because of the wind, I miss calculated some of the holes and ended up having some bogeys.
But then the back nine I was able to adjust the calculations and was able to get some birdies.
