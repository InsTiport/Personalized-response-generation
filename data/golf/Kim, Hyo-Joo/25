  THE MODERATOR:   I would like to welcome in Hyo Joo Kim into the interview room.   Another great round, 2‑under today, not as good as yesterday but still stuck with it.   Tell us how you felt throughout the entire round today.  
HYO JOO KIM:   I expected it to be a better round today, but it turned out to be worse.   But I'm doing all right.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the birdies.   You got off to a good start.   Talk about the front nine.   How did you feel coming into the round today?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I start out good but as I progressed, I lost confidence.   
   
 Q.   At what point in the round did that happen, do you think?  
HYO JOO KIM:   I had attempt to make a birdie, but I couldn't make it to a birdie.   So that's the point when I kind of struggled.  
   
 Q.   What hole was that?  
HYO JOO KIM:   From the 8 hole, I started to make mistake, but I got bogey.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to try to do tomorrow and the weekend and minimize mistakes and not try to make as many mistakes?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I plan to have birdies all the time, whenever I have a chance.   You know, it's windy outside so that's a big factor.  
   
 Q.   You said your putting was good yesterday, do you think it was just as good or worse today?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I like the putting that I performed today.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to try to do tomorrow and Saturday?   What is your game plan?   Anything specific you want to do better?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I think golf course is more slippery than other golf course, so I'm going to play‑‑ I'm going to overhit it when I putt.  
   
 Q.   Are you used to playing in winds like this or is this very windy for you?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I had a few matches last week and it was kind of windy, as well.   So I'm used to it.
