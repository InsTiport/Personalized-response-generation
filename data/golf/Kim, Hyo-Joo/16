 Q.   What's been the key to your great start this week?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I was sleepy this morning.   I just played relaxed and I just think to myself, hit soft, and that's the key for me.   Because I came early this morning, I was very tired.   
   
 Q.   How do you deal with having to play so many holes in one day?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I was worried because of‑‑ last night I was worried about doing 30 holes.   Good weather in Arizona, so I didn't feel like tired because of the weather.   
   
 Q.   So what's the approach going to be going into the weekend, likely one of the leaders?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I'm rookie of the LPGA, so I want to learn something from all the players.   So I just want to pay respect from the other players.   I want to learn from them.   
   
 Q.   Speaking of being a rookie, it's your first event as an LPGA in the United States.   What's that experience been like for you so far?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Great course, and every player I feel like are very strong players here, so I'd better concentrate more.
