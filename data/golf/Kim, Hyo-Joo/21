Q.   So a little bit of a hard start.   A little rough.   How did you get mentally back in it and finish on a better note?
HYO JOO KIM:   It was same like yesterday.   Today the wind is so hard, so I think I have to do well. 
I think that I could not do less miss, so I kept my mental.

Q.   So you thought, I have to do better, I have to do better?
HYO JOO KIM:   Uh‑huh, and less miss.

HYO JOO KIM:   16 hole.

Q.   16 hole, the pin position?
