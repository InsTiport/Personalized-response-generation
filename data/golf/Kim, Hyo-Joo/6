 Q.  Back nine you kind of went on a tear, a lot of birdies.  What was going right?  
HYO JOO KIM: I hit good drives, good tee shots and iron shots, and I managed to get up-and-down, and I made good putts.  It was good.   
 Q.  How do you feel with a somewhat sizable lead going into the final round?  
HYO JOO KIM: A long time I was leading the tournament, so I just feel happy right now.  I will be happy again tomorrow.  Every day I'm happy.   
 Q.  Did you expect to see your playing partner Lydia Ko miss such a short putt on 18?  
HYO JOO KIM: I didn't really see it.  I was already scored.  But when I turned around, I saw it miss.  But I understand; they can miss.  Even though she missed, she's still the No. 1 player.  She's Lydia Ko.  I had a lot of fun with her today.   
 Q.  Was it more pressure or inspiration playing against the world No. 1?  
HYO JOO KIM: It was a long time when she turned pro.  Before turning pro we played together, but it's been too long since I've played with Lydia.  She's younger than me, but I learned a lot of things playing today's round, and I had so much fun.  I didn't feel much pressure, I just enjoyed it with Lydia Ko, tried to learn something.   
 Q.  Your thoughts heading into tomorrow; what will your approach be tomorrow heading into the final round?  
HYO JOO KIM: I'm going to feel the same thing.  I'm not going to feel -- final round I'm not going to try to feel pressure.  But it's the same thing as yesterday, just try to feel the swing, keep going.
