Q.   Great round today.   Played really well.   Just take me through her round and what was working well for her. 
HYO JOO KIM:   (Through translation.)   Front nine I hit very well and putting was good.   Today I (indiscernible) the back nine, but later on I kind of lose my concentration and I didn't putt well.
So I just want to focus tomorrow. 

Q.   How much fun was that grouping for her?   Ariya is also 17 and Lydia is 15.   It was fun for us to watch such a young group play together. 
HYO JOO KIM:   (Through translation.)   I'm very comfortable with them because Lydia is younger than her and she know her very well.
Ariya, she play with her on February so she's very comfortable playing with them.

Q.   She played so well at Evian; tied for fourth.   What did that experience do for her, and how much confidence has that given her now competing in other LPGA events? 
HYO JOO KIM:   (Through translation.)   I finish very well in fourth place in Evian.   The thing is, you know, it was long ago, so I forgot that. 
It's always good to have the opportunity I have in the LPGA Tour.   I really have fun with the game in LPGA Tour.   This is my last goal, so I happy to be here.   Yeah.
