 Q.   The putt on nine?   Very long?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Seven meters.   
   
 Q.   How great was that to finish off on a high note on nine with that putt?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Today I score 1‑over.   I feel I did less day.   Yesterday last hole is par.   I feel same.  
   
 Q.   Same as yesterday?  
HYO JOO KIM:   Yesterday last hole.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   So how did you keep your composure, stay level headed?   You didn't play well on the front nine but played well on the back nine.   How did you do that?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I feel a little bit angry.   
But, again, I feel have the new start so I can do well.  
   
 Q.   Was there a point in the round where you started to feel better?   Was there a hole where you thought, I can turn this around?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I kept turning my mind so I can control.   
   
 Q.   She kept turning her mind?  
HYO JOO KIM:   Every time.  
   
 Q.   So she didn't feel like she really got it together the whole round?  
HYO JOO KIM:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   Was there any pressure coming into today knowing it would be difficult to match yesterday or just say, Try to play my game?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I want to erase yesterday's score, because today I have to do well.   I'm a person, so I can feel the pressure.   I will do my best.  
   
 Q.   So your goal today was to forget about the score and start a new day?   
HYO JOO KIM:   That's right.   
   
 Q.   What about the struggles today?   What were you struggling with?   Difficulties?   
HYO JOO KIM:   It's not connected for the driver and irons.   It's not connect.   
   
 Q.   Nothing was clicking all together?   Okay.   Well, you still have the lead now.   I know you're not feeling good about the round, but you have you to feel good about being at the top of the leaderboard, right?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I didn't mind the first, second.   I'm just playing.   I just think I score, not the first or second.   I just...  
   
 Q.   So you're just concerned about the score, not trying to look at the leaderboards.   
HYO JOO KIM:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   I got it.   Is this your least favorite part is talking to the media?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I want to be your best friend.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   Any other questions?   Okay, perfect.
