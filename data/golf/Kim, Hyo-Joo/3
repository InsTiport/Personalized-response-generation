Q. You're in the lead, 12 under.  How does it feel to be the leader after two rounds?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I saw the scoreboard and some player got 14 under, so I tried to focus on my game.
Then, yeah, that's it.  Yeah.
Q. So you had seven birdies and only two bogeys.  Any holes that were very good for you?  What was it about your game that was working well today?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I remember No. 7; No. 7 I missed the tee shot.  And the second also.
I felt it's a miss but it's hit the rough and then into the green.  So the wind was help that hole.
Q. You talk about the wind.  The wind got more throughout the day.  Does it bother your game at all, or are you happy to be done before it gets even more windy?
HYO JOO KIM: (Through translation.)  I mean, like actually the other players have to tee off afternoon and then two round more remain, so no pressure like yet.  Yeah, just want to focus on weekend.  Yeah.
