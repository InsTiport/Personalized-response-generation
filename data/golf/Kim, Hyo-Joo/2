Q. How was your day?
HYO-JOO KIM: Well, I'm happy with how it turned out.  First of all, I didn't have too many mistakes.  Also I was lucky enough to be paired up with the player that I'm pretty familiar and close to.  So that also helped, I think.
Whenever the opportunity presented for me to get a birdie, I think I managed to capture that.  So I'm also happy about that.
Q. How much practice were you able to get in this week?  Did you spend much time getting to know the course?
HYO-JOO KIM: I got one day, 18 holes, on practice round.  The other day I got nine holes and that's probably all I got.  But then again, it didn't hurt me that much not knowing the course that clearly.  But it just worked out, I guess.
Q. South Koreans have much success in this U.S. Open.  Do you think that you have a chance to tomorrow to add to that list with a great round?
HYO-JOO KIM: Well, realistically, I'm a few strokes behind her.  But this course has been pretty good to Korean players, so I have not given up.  I'm going in tomorrow with the hopes that I might have that chance.  Who knows.
Q. Do you have an explanation for why this tournament has been so good for your countrywomen?
HYO-JOO KIM: Well, as we all know, Se Ri Pak kind of opened up the gate for all of us.  It's very inspiring for all of us who want to become like her.  I think this tournament means probably more to Korean players.  That's one of reasons, I guess.
