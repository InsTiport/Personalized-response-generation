  MODERATOR:   It is my pleasure to welcome in the 2014 Evian Championship winner, Hyo Joo Kim, into the press conference room.   Hyo Joo, congratulations.  
HYO JOO KIM:   Thank you.  
MODERATOR:   You looked a little shocked on the 18th green.   Did you know you won?   I think your caddie said you might not have known.   Did you know at that moment?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I was very nervous, so I didn't think about winner.   On the 18 hole putting I did all my power on there.   
MODERATOR:   Did you feel nervous at all starting the day today?   On the first tee you said you felt a little nervous.   Did you feel nervous in the morning?   
HYO JOO KIM:   No, I'm not nervous on the first, but I'm nervous at the 18th hole tee shot.   
MODERATOR:   18 hole tee shot.   Take use through that.   I know it was a tight tee shot.   What was going through your mind walking on the 18th tee?   
HYO JOO KIM:   If I didn't score the birdie then I didn't win the play, so I thought that I have to do only birdie.   
MODERATOR:   So you knew going in you had to make a birdie.   You kept a pretty level head on your two bogeys on the back nine, the two late bogeys.   How did you keep your composure and stay calm and regroup and go to 18?   
HYO JOO KIM:   I didn't think I did a bogey, so I just concentrate and do my play and do the best.  
MODERATOR:   You didn't think you had a bogey?   Just thought, Nope, didn't happen?   Yes.  
HYO JOO KIM:   (Laughter.)
