(Through translation.)   
 Q.  Same kind of feeling today as yesterday?  Just felt really good out on the course?  
HYO-JOO KIM: Definitely feeling yesterday was way better.  Still today I played great, so I feel good.   
 Q.  You like playing in the mornings better than the afternoons?  
HYO-JOO KIM: Doesn't really matter.  Afternoon or the morning, doesn't matter to me.   
Early in the morning wind is a little more quiet; afternoon I can go sleep a little bit more, so that's two things different.   
 Q.  You do anything to celebrate your birthday last night?  
HYO-JOO KIM: I couldn't do too much to celebrate because yesterday we finished late and then we've got to come out early in the morning.  So I just ate dinner with dad and me (translator) and went to sleep.   
 Q.  What did you learn from the course yesterday that helped for today?  
HYO-JOO KIM: Normally I focus on swing pretty much like normally.  But I didn't focus on the golf course, because if I focus on the golf swing, all the golf course is kind of the same thing to me.
