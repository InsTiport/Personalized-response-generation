  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Hyo Joo Kim, even par 72, very good effort considering the conditions today.   How big of a factor was the wind for you today? 
HYO JOO KIM:   So I think the wind picked up considerably compared to the rest of the field, from the first hole to the last hole but I'm satisfied with my play today.
THE MODERATOR:   How much fun did you have today?   Know you played alongside your friends.   Minjee said you had a lot of fun.   What was the best part about playing with your friends? 
HYO JOO KIM:   When I saw the group yesterday, I knew immediately that I would feel very comfortable with the game and I knew I would have fun.   It was a lot of fun and we talked a lot. 

Q.   So considering all success you had this year, what is your goal for this championship? 
HYO JOO KIM:   I think my score here two years ago and last year was not that satisfactory.   My whole goal this year was and is to play better than last year. 

Q.   So it seems that you have experience playing with Minjee and Lydia since your amateur years, and now you're all going to be touring professionals.   So I'm curious to know what you think are the strengths of Lydia and Minjee are? 
HYO JOO KIM:   As for Lydia, I get this question a lot and I answer it, she's an exceptionally strong putter. 
And for Minjee, actually it's the first time I've played with her in competition, and I think that she has a very positive mind‑set.   And like myself, she's a bit simple‑minded and I think that helps her, as well.   So the two players have different strengths, but I think that they are both exceptionally good players.
