 Q.   Another really good round, what's been the key?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Been really good with the driver, second, third, totally all the clubs.   If I miss, I save, so I'm playing good.   All the putts feel good.   
   
 Q.   You've been in contention before, obviously winning a major championship, how much will that help you tomorrow?   How much does it help that you've won a major and have experience?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Yeah, I've won before‑‑ and I've been playing four or five times a year on the LPGA.   So I have experience but not much like this in the States.  
   
 Q.   When you grew up playing golf, when do you look up to?   Who was your idol?  
HYO JOO KIM:   When I start playing, golf was just a hobby.   But mostly Annika Sorenstam and SeRiPak, of course.   
   
 Q.   How did SeRiPak motivate you, and have you spoken to Se Ri since you turned professional?   
HYO JOO KIM:   Just simple talking with her.   Just asking me how was playing today, like that kind of stuff.   But definitely she's been helpful for mentally.
