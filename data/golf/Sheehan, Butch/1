 Q. Pretty good round compared to the rest of the field. 
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: Not too bad. 

 Q. Meet your expectations?
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: Yeah, I missed a short putt on 6. I had a bad one there. Other than that it was pretty solid. I didn't get in trouble really and when I did, I like on 18, I got it up-and-down, so. 

 Q. Any surprises on the course today?
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: No, well, the golf course is playing fast, playing real fast. Ball's running out pretty good in the fairways and the greens are getting firm. 

 Q. You had a birdie on the par-3 there, the second hole. 
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: Yeah, I knocked it in there about three and a half, four feet it was a nice little 6-iron.

 Q. Was that one of your better drives?
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: It was just, you know, mediocre 3-iron or three par, it plays 170, 173 or something. Whatever it was. Nice little shot in there about three, three and a half feet whatever it was and made it.

 Q. Any adjustments to make for tomorrow?
 BUTCH SHEEHAN: Make some putts. I hit the ball decently, just got to make some putts.
