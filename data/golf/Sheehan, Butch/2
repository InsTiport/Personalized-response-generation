Q.  How do you feel you did today on your round?  You shot a 1 under?
BUTCH SHEEHAN:  Well, I had double bogey.  I thought I drove the ball pretty good on number 4.  Drove it through three feet into the rough and it was about in eight inches of grass and made double there.

I missed a three footer on the last hole for birdie.  But other than that was pretty good.
Q.  Being a club pro do you feel pretty confident about your game now as far as the other professionals?
BUTCH SHEEHAN:  I spent two years out here, 2002 to 2003 I was on the Champions Tour.
