  Q.  Brill
Q.   Brilliant round of 66, the highlight of which came when you holed your second shot at 10.   Tell us about that one?
DANIEL BROOKS:   Hit it in the right rough off the tee, which is not the ideal place coming to a front right pin.   But hit a full 9‑iron, came out perfect and landed a couple yards short and trickled in.

Q.   3‑under through 12 holes yesterday and dropped five shots coming in; how determined today not to let that happen? 
DANIEL BROOKS:   Sort of been the story the last few months, really, where I'm going nicely and I hit a patch where I sort of lose the plot and struggle a bit.   Same happened yesterday.   Come off the course, probably not in the best mood but felt like I was playing quite nicely.   So get out there again today and try to do the same what I did early on.

Q.   You mentioned the torrid stretch, 13 missed cuts in row, was there any sign this was coming?   How difficult has that stretch been? 
DANIEL BROOKS:   It's been tough the last few months.   When you sort of get on a run like that, it's not good.   It gets you down a bit.   Last week actually was the best I played in a few months.   Just missed out on the number last week which is a bit unfortunate. 
But played quite steady and played okay at Woburn on Tuesday for one round, and so going along quite nicely this week so far.

Q.   Is there always a sense that one big week can change everything? 
DANIEL BROOKS:   Yeah, definitely, especially like these big weeks, these big money events.   You only need a good week and it bumps you up The Race to Dubai.
