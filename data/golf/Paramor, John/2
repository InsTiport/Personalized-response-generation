Q. Can you explain what happened exactly John, please?
JOHN PARAMOR:   Rory s ball came to rest in a marked gallery crosswalk to the left of the 2nd fairway from which relief is available under the rules, as if it s a piece of ground under repair. He found what he thought to be his nearest point of relief where the ball was outside and when he dropped the ball within a club s length, when he actually stood to the ball, his left foot was standing on or just over the line demarking the area of ground under repair which is treated as part of the ground under repair. Therefore he has not taken full relief and he is in breach of the Rule 25/1, the penalty for which is two strokes.
