Q. You were all square through first two, and you kind of took the lead and never let it go.  Talk about the match.
TRENT PHILLIPS: Yeah, I wouldn't say I have my best game at all right now.  I'm really just finding a way to get it in the hole.  Although it maybe a little stressful, I'm getting it in the hole.  That's what you got to do.
I'm just going to stick with what been working so far and just keep on plugging.
Q. You have Cole Hammer in the round of 16.  Thoughts on that matchup?
TRENT PHILLIPS: I've known Cole for a while so it should be fun.  He's a good player.  Should be a fun match.  Looking forward to it.
Q. Going forward, I know it's a short time in between, but anything you're looking to change or just stay with the same game plan?
TRENT PHILLIPS: Not really.  Just stay aggressive, and if you get up, keep the pedal down and don't let up.
