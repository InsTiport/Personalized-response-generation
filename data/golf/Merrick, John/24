  Q. Bogey free, you make birdies at 17. What a great birdie at 17. Our Kodak Challenge hole makes it a deuce there. Then you make a birdie at 18, and make the turn and make a birdie at 1?  
 JOHN MERRICK: I know, I had 7 pars to start. And stay close in there at 17. All you're trying to do is hit the green, and it worked out. A birdie, and pretty good wedge in on 18 and made another putt. Yeah, I caught three in a row really fast.  
  
  Q. You finished Top 10 at the Masters. How much does that give you confidence for the remainder of the year?   
 JOHN MERRICK: It kind of relaxes you a little bit. It was great playing, you know, in that kind of intense atmosphere. Then that gives you a lot of confidence.   
 I had a good week off last week. And I think the hard work that I put in during Augusta is kind of, I think, showing off a little bit.  
  
  Q. You're having such a solid and consistent year. Is there any reason for the change? Not really the change, but the continuation of a world class career?   
 JOHN MERRICK: Yeah, I know it's my third year out here now. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can every week. You just really need to work hard out here and stay positive, and you know, try to improve all parts of my game. You know, it's working right now. I'm happy with the start I've had.
