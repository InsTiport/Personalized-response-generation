 Q.   John, played well in the first round.   I know you got to come back in the morning and keep it going.   Sometimes it's kind of tough but bogeyed early, but a real nice round of golf.  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah.   Kind of, you know, just stayed pretty even keel today.   Didn't hit it as well today as I did yesterday.   Not as comfortable with my swing.   Got some good up and downs and I was happy with it.  
   
 Q.   I was looking at your schedule, you played a lot of golf this year.   I think this is the 15th, 16th tournament.   Had some missed cuts.  
JOHN MERRICK:   I feel like I've been close.   Just need a little bit of momentum, drop a couple putts at the right time.   I didn't feel like I'm doing anything different.   Kind of working out this week.   That's all I can say.  
   
 Q.   All right.   5-under and thoughts on the weekend now?  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah.   Keep my head down and keep playing and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Good stuff today.   Good luck Saturday and Sunday.  
JOHN MERRICK:   All right.
