 Q.   John, when we talked yesterday you said "going to keep my head down and keep plugging along."  
JOHN MERRICK:   It was good.   Kind of grinded it out.   Tough conditions out there today.   Really windy, tough to pull a club.   I had some kind of icky points in the middle of the round and hung in there, made a long bogey putt, I think on 13, and then made a long par putt on 15, which kind of saved my round.   
I was able to birdie 16 and 17.   So it was kind of one those rounds it could have gone either way and kind of grinded through and finished strong.   I was really pleased.   
   
 Q.   I don't know if you're the type of guy that looks at the number you might have to shoot during a certain round.   Did you have any idea that a 1-under for you today would have you atop the leaderboard?  
JOHN MERRICK:   This course is sneaky.   Once the wind starts blowing, the greens get firmer.   You don't need to make a ton of birdies.   You need to play smart and make a bunch of pars, kind of grind it out you can move up the leaderboard.  
   
 Q.   Scrambling, I looked at these numbers.   Nineteen times up you had to make a up and down.   Sixteen times you did it.  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah.   It's like past tournaments I feel like my ball-striking has been the same as this week.   I haven't been kind of chipping and putting this week.   I'm chipping and putting better.
