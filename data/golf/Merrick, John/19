 Q. Pleased with 2-under 70?
 JOHN MERRICK: I am. I scored well. I felt like I got around the course okay. I've only played a practice round around here, so it's a good round under my belt and I'm happy. 

 Q. The conditions, how would you describe conditions? Easier than you thought maybe? 
 JOHN MERRICK: You know, the first four holes played tough. They were right into the wind and I could only see my ball fly about 150 yards in the fog for the first four holes, so that played tough. 
 But the conditions, there's nine holes into the wind and nine holes downwind, so the holes downwind, you have to take advantage of those, and then 1 through 4 is into the wind -- if you take advantage of those holes, you can shoot a good score. The greens are soft so you can make some good scores.

 Q. Do you like this golf course?
 JOHN MERRICK: I do. I couldn't really -- it was a lot to digest in the practice round, and I feel like I got more comfortable. It's nice when they allow you to hit it close and make some birdies, so it's fun. 

 Q. 2-under in the first round of a major, pretty good start?
 JOHN MERRICK: I'm happy. I'm happy. Anything under par I think is pretty good and I wanted to just kind of get used to the golf course a little bit more and I made some putts, so overall, I'm happy. 

 Q. How about the group you were in, did you feed off each other a little bit? I think you're the first group to come in all red?
 JOHN MERRICK: Yeah, we played well. We hit some good shots out there and we all made some putts, so it was a good group.
