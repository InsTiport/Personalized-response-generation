 Q.   What was the difference today?   Was it a little tougher pin placements?  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, a little breeze out there, which is pretty common out there.  
I played okay.   Just had a couple of hiccups, didn't make any birdies.   Made an eagle on 16.   But it was just kind of a‑‑ just a tough day out there, really.   Just couldn't get anything going.   
Just kind of had a‑‑ gosh, just messed up on 10.   Didn't take my time.   We had a short putt for par and missed it, wasn't really thinking.   And missed a short putt for bogey, made double there.   I hit it into the lip of the trap on 15 off the tee and had to wedge out.   
That's golf.   You get bad breaks.   Just one of those days I couldn't get anything going.  
   
 Q.   That eagle had to be a big‑‑  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, it was great.   I didn't really feel like I played that bad.   I made that double and just missed a couple 6‑, 8‑footers for par, which could have GONE in.   All of a sudden 4 over par for the day.   It was nice to roll in that putt for eagle.   I made a good par save on 17.   On 18, it's just such a tough putt.   You can't believe how much that putt breaks to the right.  
Overall it was just kind of an opposite day than the first day.   I got it going the first day and then today I just couldn't get anything going.  
   
 Q.   After a couple of hiccups you still going to be happy with where you are at on the leaderboard?  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, it's a tough golf course.   Yesterday I just didn't‑‑ I think I got all my birdies out of the way and only made one bogey yesterday.   You're going to make bogeys out here.   Just kind of made a few in a four or five hole stretch today.   It happens.   And hopefully make some birdies tomorrow.
