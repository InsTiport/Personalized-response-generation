Q.   Good give us a sense of the difficulty of the course?
JOHN MERRICK:   Whenever courses get firm and fast, it's always tough, especially around here, with the breaks of the greens and when you get short‑sided, it's tough to get up‑and‑down.   You add the firmness of the greens and it just makes it that much harder.   I felt that I let it slip away a little bit in spots and was able to hang in there. 

Q.   That being said, how good is 1‑under par? 
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, I'll take it.   I played the par 5s great.   Yeah, you're going to have to make a lot of putts out here because you're not going to hit every green.   You know you're going to be chipping and you have to make those putts inside ten feet.   But I was generally happy with the day. 
I saw some UCLA cheerleaders out there, pretty psyched.   Got a lot of support out there from fans and friends and family coming up from Long Beach.   So it was a good time. 

Q.   How do you approach tomorrow? 
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, looks like I got in the last group‑‑ I wanted to get in the last group, and yeah, three back, and going to have to make a lot of birdies to catch him. 

Q.   With the course playing as it is, how difficult is it to be aggressive? 
JOHN MERRICK:   No, it is.   It's tough.   You really need to pick your spots here, definitely.   You can't shoot at every flag, and that's kind of one of those things around here, it just Bates you into being more aggressive than you need and you need to putt well obviously.
