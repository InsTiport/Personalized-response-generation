 Q.   What's it like emotionally knowing you've got to birdie to get in.   Is that tough?  
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, I started the back of the pack and behind the 8â€‘ball.   I figured I needed a top 10 to probably make it, and I didn't, so I'm probably not going to make it.   Not the end of the world.   I felt like I played a solid week, just needed a couple more shots.  
   
 Q.   Did you know you needed an eagle on the last hole?  
JOHN MERRICK:   I kept looking at the board, and it kept saying, if he makes one more stroke then he needs another one or something like that, so I figured I needed two.   I figured I needed to birdie 17 and 18.   I thought I hit a great shot on 17, just went past the hole.   Yeah, just had a tough putt on 18, still hit a good one.   
I played solid, just not good enough.   When you start out at 98 you can't expect to just cruise through to the next round.   You've got to play well, and I almost did.  
   
 Q.   You have a great attitude, but you came to close.   That's got to be gnawing at you a little bit.   
JOHN MERRICK:   Yeah, it is, yeah, to finish that close.   I guess I would rather finish like this than missing the cut or whatever.   I guess I'll just take some time off, and I'm going to probably play a couple times in the fall.
