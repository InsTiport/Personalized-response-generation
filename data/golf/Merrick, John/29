  Q. I guess you're actually a crowd pleaser, making eagle on 18 and 9?  
 JOHN MERRICK: It was crazy. It was nice to finish like that coming off the delay and coming out and hitting a 3-wood on the green and making the putt; it was pretty neat.  
  
  Q. Talk about the eagle on 18.   
 JOHN MERRICK: Killed my drive and had a perfect yardage for my pitching wedge which is 127 so just smooth wedge and hit it and went behind the hole and looked like it rattled the stick a little bit and disappeared so that's pretty cool.  
  
  Q. Finishing on the front nine, you hang around on even par, and you play the last five holes at 5-under and you're in the mix?  
 JOHN MERRICK: I felt like I was hitting great the last couple of days, just not close, 15 feet, 2-putt and kind of happened fast.
