Q.   How'd you hit them?
JOHN MERRICK:   Had a good day.   Hit a lot of good fairways and greens, able to string some birdies together there at the end.   Missed some putts in the beginning of the round, but finished strong.   I two‑putted both par 5s for birdie, so that was nice, made a couple of ten‑foot putts there at the end to finish it off.

Q.   So momentum's going for you?
JOHN MERRICK:   Yep, momentum's going.   If conditions stay like this the rest of the week, it's going to be a birdie fest the rest of the week.   Flag locations were pretty tough today.   They put them on the edges, but it's going to be great for scoring.   The greens are holding and the fairways are pretty soft.   So you're not going to have a whole lot of run off into the rough.
