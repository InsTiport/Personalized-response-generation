Q. 66, bogey-free.  Best round since July.  What was going so well out there for you?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think my coach is here, so if any problem, he will fix it.  So I don't think too much.  Just hit the ball.
This is last tournament, so I just want to finish it and get some rest.  Yeah.
Q. What kind of things has your coach been telling you the last couple weeks and leading up into today?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Just need to more believe myself.  I change a little backswing, so feel a little bit more solid.
Q. You're good friends with Yani Tseng.
PEIYUN CHIEN: Right.
Q. What kind of things did you learn from her that you can apply to your game?
PEIYUN CHIEN: She hits so far, far and far.  I think short game is very good.  We practice together, so just learn a little bit, yeah.
Q. What kind of things do you hope to improve on?  Is there anything you want to improve for tomorrow's round?
PEIYUN CHIEN: No.  I'm not thinking about that way.  I just enjoy my game and do better my backswing.
That's it.  I don't think too much.
Q. How have you felt about your rookie season now that you're at the last event?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think this is good year for me.  I think it's good year for rookie.  Very happy to finish like top 60, yeah.
Q. Looking forward to the off-season as well?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Everybody.
Q. You said you worked on something in your backswing?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Yeah.
Q. What was that?  What change did you make?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Because I always too outside my first move, so my coach wanted me just keep little inside.  That's it.  Pretty easy.
But I always want to hit more far, so I use a lot hand.
Q. What do you need to continue to do to win this tournament?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think keep patient.  Yeah, that's it.
