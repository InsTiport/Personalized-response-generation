 Q.  Congratulations on a wonderful four days; are you proud of how you've played this week?  
PEIYUN CHIEN: Proud, very proud, because a lot of Taiwanese, a lot of Taiwan fans really care about this tournament, and I played well.  I think still a lot of pressure for me.  On 11 and 12, I missed a driver, and the second one -- I can get better.   
 Q.  But still an incredible week and your best finish on the LPGA.  How do you feel now as you head overseas to Scotland?  
PEIYUN CHIEN: I feel great because I worked with my caddie about six months.  We are getting better, and every week we find some problem and we will change it, so we are getting better.  I think for me looking here, a top 10 is great.  Yeah, I'm very proud of me.
