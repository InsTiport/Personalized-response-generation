Q. So you birdied the last hole; you had six or seven birdies today.  How do you feel?  You seem to be playing well.
PEIYUN CHIEN: It's not bad because the front nine I was a little bit nervous, so I got two three-putts in the front nine.  I tried my cross-hand because my putting ball position is a little change, so I change that, and the putting is better.
Q. And you said yesterday you were trying to swing more freely; were you able to do that?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Yeah, I tried to -- don't think about a lot the swing.  It's hard to me because this year my swing, it change a lot, so I need to think about swing, but in close I cannot think, so it's tough.
Q. Do you feel like you're playing the best you've played this week in a while?
PEIYUN CHIEN: This week, because I tried to get in the Open, I want to play because I didn't play -- because this is lucky year for me.
Q. So you're trying to get in the British?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Yeah.
Q. So you've played well; do you watch the scores the rest of the day?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I try to don't look at the leaderboard.  More relaxed.
