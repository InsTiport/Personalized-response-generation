 Q.  So you have three birdies but one bogey there at the end today.  Tell me how you felt playing today.  
PEIYUN CHIEN: I feel a little pressure for me, and I think today is pretty windy, so it's more hotter, but I still had a lot of birdie chances, but I didn't make them, and a lot of up-and-downs because a little windy, a lot of between clubs.  So doing well, and it's a lot of greens, up-and-down a lot.  Just last hole didn't make it.  It's pretty tough because I think that I should just use 3-wood.  I used driver, that's why bunker to bunker.  Pretty tough.   
 Q.  Right now we still have a group left, but you're only two strokes off the lead, so close.  How do you feel going into tomorrow's last round?  
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think it was a little windy, so I'm not very aggressive.  Tomorrow, if any chance, like pitching wedge, I will go more aggressive, yeah.   
 Q.  So you'll push tomorrow if you need to?  
PEIYUN CHIEN: Yeah, but still will be like safe.   
 Q.  What would it mean to you to get your first LPGA win?  
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think it's very important because I play a lot of golf.  Start in Taiwan and Asian Tour, try to get qualified.  It's very tough.  LPGA is pretty tough.  I didn't play well when I qualified, so I played the Symetra Tour, and it's another tough one, tough Tour.  Everybody is like very hungry, very strong.  I'm very lucky top 10.  If I won, I'd be very happy, yeah.
