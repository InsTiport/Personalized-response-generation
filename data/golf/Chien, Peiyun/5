Q. You had eight birdies and one bogey, a very good round.  How do you feel coming off the golf course?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I think the golf course is narrow and a lot -- it's very tough first shot because you need to play a cut or little draw a lot, not just hit it straight.  Doing well today because I changed my playing because I'm always thinking the swing on the golf course, so today I just played freely, tried to find some feeling and play, and it's worked, so I'm very happy.  I will keep doing, yeah.
Q. I'm sure you hope to do that again tomorrow?
PEIYUN CHIEN: Yeah.
Q. What do you do between rounds?  I know it's very quick from today to tomorrow.  How do you prepare?
PEIYUN CHIEN: I'm going to eat some sushi with my whole family because they like Asian food, so I'm very happy, and they have a small dog that's so cute.
