 Q.  You were 4-under today.  What was working well and how are course conditions?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: I think it helped starting off early because there was less wind.  Course conditions I think have been the same pretty much all week.   
So I think just today was focusing on landing spots and getting better with kind of how the greens are reacting and where to miss the ball, because out here, pin might be in one place but you're aiming at a whole other place.  I just think today was smooth.  I didn't have any unlucky bounces or bad lies.  For the most part it was really good.   
 Q.  You had a good finish here last year and you're going to have another good finish this year.  What is it you like about this tournament and the course?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: I think I like the course.  It plays hard, kind of like majors do.  Scores aren't super low, so it's not a complete birdie-fest.  It challenges all aspects of the game, and I enjoy that.  I think sometimes the course defeats half the players before they go out there, so I just try to keep a positive attitude about it and enjoy the resort.  It's tropical and nice.  You can't really beat it.
