 Q. Did you change your game plan a bit? After the delay everything was a little softer and there was no wind. 
 RYANN O'TOOLE: I didn't change it right away. It was more like you're gathering information as you go along. It's just like you find out -- I mean, played two holes, one hoe was a reachable par-4, and then next hole par-5. It's just like -- so I didn't really factor in -- I didn't really notice weather, or at least (indiscernible) until the par-3 when, you know, all day I didn't hit a full pitching wedge 120 yards or whatever it is, 132 out here. 
 It's flying five yards shorter, so, you know, it's like, okay, you've got to make note of that, and then it's just -- you know, I left a couple putts short when I went back out there. Just trying to get myself to hit it after putting really well after 28 holes, it's tough to transition. 

 Q. What would you say is the part of your game helping you the most, helping you score out there?
 RYANN O'TOOLE: I'm definitely keeping the ball in play. I'm hitting a lot of fairways and hitting a lot of greens. I'm not putting myself in any like crucial positions. 
 When I do kind of hit an errant shot, I take my medicine. If I take a bogey, I just kind of move on. It's one of those where you can't get mad about getting bogeys. It's key just to play one shot at a time and make par, then birdies will come. 
 But I've been putting well this week, so I haven't really given much away with putts, which has been nice. I think that just kind of, you know, keeps the ball rolling and keeps your momentum going.

 Q. How do you feel about your position now going into the weekend? I guess you still have a few holes to play tomorrow morning. 
 RYANN O'TOOLE: I'm glad that I have four holes to play tomorrow morning, so I can capitalize, you know, and finish the 36 holes that I started and leave it on a good note. 
 I have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth with a couple bogeys that I made when we went back out. But I can always turn that around, reverse it tomorrow morning. 
 9 is a great par-5, birdie hole. Any hole is really a birdie hole if you set yourself up for it.
