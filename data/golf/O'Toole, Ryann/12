 Q.  Day one 69.  You just caught fire there on the back with the five have birdies.  What changed there when you made the turn?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: You know, I just stayed patient.  I started my round a little slow.  I think it was early; warming up in the dark also.  My caddie does a really good job of keeping me patient and just waiting for them to drop.   
Started getting on a roll and sticking it close and was running with it.   
 Q.  This is your best start in a tournament so far in 2018.  What have you been working on?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: You know, I think what I've been working on in the off-season is a lot of ball striking, kind of putting, short game, and trying to just grow confidence basically.  And not getting ahead myself.   
So setting small goals and then allowing that to kind of lead to better things.   
 Q.  We kind of had this annoying intermittent rain throughout the day.  How were the conditions out there today?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: I know.  Southern California and it's raining.  It wasn't too bad.  It wasn't a heavy rain.  No lightning.  Wasn't that bad.  Umbrella here or there, but I never put on rain gear so it was fine.
