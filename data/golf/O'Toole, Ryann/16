Q. So a lot of people going low today.  What do you think is different about today out there?
RYANN O'TOOLE: There's not really any wind.  Pins are accessible, and it's warm.  So the ball is flying, and I think the course is getting firmer, so things are rolling out, which is nice.  I just feel like I was a lot of short irons in today and not too much breeze, so the holes that would be intro the wind yesterday you had nothing.
Q. You had bogey on 1 and then kind of went on a tear?
RYANN O'TOOLE: Yeah.  I kind of feel like I was not awake or something happened.  I had gap wedge into the hole, and I just hit it short and then three-putted.  I'm like, really?  Okay, wake up, Ryan.  And then after that it was back to what the whole week has really been.  I mean I played well yesterday.  I just had two bad lucks on the last hole that kind of cost me and made me frustrated all night.  So I think I let out a little fire today.
Q. What will you do to get ready for tomorrow's round?
RYANN O'TOOLE: For tomorrow's round?  I don't know.  Kind of feel like I want to do the same, but I will probably, honestly, hit a couple putts, just feel like the stroke is still going good, do some speed stuff because the greens are getting a little faster, hit some shots and go home.  I mean when you're hitting it well, there's nothing really to fix, so I don't want to go find something on the range or go wonder what's up.  For some reason I tend to hit it right on this range and then I get on the golf course and that's not the shot at all.  So I don't want to spend too much time over there.  Just kind of relax and get ready for tomorrow.  I just put myself in position to miss my flight.  So I gotta go look for an alternative flight.
Q. You called over a rules official on 18.  What was the issue there?  Was it a sprinkler head?
RYANN O'TOOLE: Yeah.  There was a sprinkler head that basically I was rubbing right over on my back stroke, so if I putt it or chip it, it was kind of just in play.  I was trying to see what direction I could go.  I was hoping to go right and just be able to putt it and not have to go through any fringe.  Sometimes it's nice when you use the rules to your advantage, you can get a lot of times a better lie, better angle, anything.
