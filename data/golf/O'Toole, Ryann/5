 Q.  Ryann, you're a bit of a local girl here, aren't you?  UCLA is only 20 minutes away.  How much fun do you have playing in front of your home fans and home crowd?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: Oh, I love it.  I mean, there is no better place to be able to play around than people that love you and support you and know who you are, and especially turf that you know.   
Definitely enjoying my time out here.   
 Q.  I saw you rolling in a few good putts out there.  How different is playing in the afternoon to morning?  How much are you looking forward to playing tomorrow morning?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: Well, since the greens are poana, morning to afternoon is much different.  Especially out here they get fast in the morning, so fresh, but they'll definitely roll better.   
You have to stay patient in the afternoon.  I could see it on the back side.  A few putts that took off quickly wrong.  So, I mean, that's all I can do.  It's a tough track and pars are good.   
See if I can squeak in a couple birdies.   
 Q.  Since you're a local girl and we're got like the whole crew listening to every word, what's a good place to eat around here?  
RYANN O'TOOLE: Sugarfish.  There are quite a few locations of it, but it's awesome.  You go earlier the better, otherwise it's a long wait.   
Yeah, I heard you talking to Lizette earlier about Trojan fans.  I think I see a lot more blue out here.
