 Q.  Pease Bay is only about half an hour from here.  
TIFFANY JOH: I was doing a little research.  I heard that there's like one shop that I can maybe rent a board from but I'm hoping if I just put out my energy to like Twitter or Instagram, someone in the area will be like, hey, you can use our board.   
 Q.  We'll do our best --  
TIFFANY JOH: I saw a picture in the men's locker room and it's like Brooks Koepka on like the 11 tee, and there's like a little -- there's some corduroy lines coming in off of the horizon.  It looked really good but Bronty said she had walked around down there -- I went at low tide and it looks like a lot of things you can break your neck on.   
 Q.  Pease Bay is definitely the place.  
TIFFANY JOH: Apparently it's hard to play golf if you break your neck.  That's what I've heard.
