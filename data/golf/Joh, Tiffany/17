Q. What's your assessment of your play through the first two rounds?
TIFFANY JOH: You know, today was super, super scrappy.  Yesterday I hit it a lot more solid than I did today.
I think every day you kind of just have to accept it for what it's going to be.  And today I scrambled really well.  But then I have to just shut the book on this round and focus on tomorrow's.  And I think that's kind of how you have to tackle this course.
Q. You mentioned the course.  What particularly do you like about Sahalee and how does it fit your game?
TIFFANY JOH: I just like the Pacific Northwest in general.  I love this temperature.  It's a little bit colder than some people like.  But I love it.  And I love the tree-lined fairways and everything, and the greens are in perfect shape.  If you can pick a good line and roll it consistently over where you're going to roll it you can make tons of putts out here.
Q. What's the game plan going into the weekend?
TIFFANY JOH: I think hit a few more fairways, because I think that makes it a little bit easier on you.  So we're going to try to do that.
But then I think the key to this course is patience.  I think on Thursday when I was starting to play, I knew that everyone was going to like get bad lies, and everyone is going to screw up and everyone is going to make mistakes, and it's kind of a matter of who reacts the best to that.  The worst you can do here is out of the rough create a shot that doesn't really exist.  The worst you can do is be in a bad position, be like, I'm just going to hit a draw, slice, fade that goes high, then goes back really low and then goes back high again.  You have to just kind of take your medicine.
