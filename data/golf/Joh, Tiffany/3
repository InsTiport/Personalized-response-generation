 Q.  Two of the most enjoyable personalities on the LPGA Tour.  Tiffany Joh, I'll start with you first.  How many hot dogs in the hot dog eating contest that Marina Alex won?  
TIFFANY JOH: Well, we did two hot dogs for straight speed, and by the time I had finished laughing she was already done with her two hot dogs, so it wasn't really even a close contest.   
 Q.  To the round today.  We mentioned you two seem to have a lot of fun on the golf course.  You're both always smiling.  How good that for the energy in order to perform properly?  
TIFFANY JOH: Oh, man, every time I see Shanshan on the pairing sheet next to my name I get really excited.  She plays really quick.  She's really refreshing.  I just love watching her play.  I could say I'm a big fan fan.   
SHANSHAN FENG: Oh, come on.   
TIFFANY JOH: (Laughter.)   
SHANSHAN FENG: Big fan of yours, too.   
TIFFANY JOH: Stop.   
SHANSHAN FENG: Oh, yeah.   
 Q.  All kidding aside, 7-under today out of you as well - 6-under for Tiffany, 7-under for you.  Does the pairing help when you're both playing well?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Of course.  I was really happy to play with Tiff, too.  She was being really tough on me.  I made that eagle on 13th hole and I still didn't get the honor to tee off on the next hole.   
I would say I really enjoyed the whole day.  We both played really well and I felt like we were almost on one team and trying to go low.   
 Q.  Your thoughts going into tomorrow?  
SHANSHAN FENG: End of last week actually at the interview I said this year I have never been the winning circle so far.  My goal was actually try to get in the winning circle as soon as possible.  I was trying to get every part of my game together, so I think I've been doing pretty well for the first three days.   
Just keep it going.
