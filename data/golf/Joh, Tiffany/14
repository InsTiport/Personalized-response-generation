Q. What is your approach?  You climbed --
TIFFANY JOH: Yeah, when it's like this and it's kind of a birdie-fest, it's super fun, but it's also stressful if you're not making birdies, so I think the best thing to do is to not stress out.
Q. How do you feel your game is going into next week now?
TIFFANY JOH: Yeah, you know, I feel really good about it.  Obviously next week's setup is going to be a little different, so that's going to be an adjustment.  But like good golf is good golf, so I'm feeling pretty good going into next week.
Q. From the course to the clubhouse to the operation, how did these guys do in their baptism?
TIFFANY JOH: Oh, man, awesome.  It's funny, I actually flew in a little late and my clubs got in like Wednesday night, so I kind of wished that I had gotten here a little bit earlier.  It's just such a beautiful course, and the area is so beautiful.  I had my first go at cheese curds last night, and those were amazing.  I had a double bacon butter burger for the first time, and that was pretty good.
Q. Welcome to Wisconsin.
TIFFANY JOH: Yeah, but my stomach wasn't happy around 2:00 a.m.  But yeah, it was delicious, so now I know.
Q. Now you know the good fuel for the next tournament?
TIFFANY JOH: Yeah, and a root beer apparently.  I did it right.
