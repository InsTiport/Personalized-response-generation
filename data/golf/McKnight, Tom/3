Q.  How do you feel that playing in the World Amateur and on the Walker Cup team will help you in your first senior PGA tournament?
TOM MCKNIGHT:  I don't know.  I don't know how you can compare the two.  It's a totally different situation now than playing amateur golf.  That was representing your country and that was a whole different scenario than being out here now and playing like on the Champions Tour this year.

So it's hard to compare those two situations.
