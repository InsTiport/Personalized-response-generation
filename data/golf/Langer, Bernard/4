Q. How would you compare your second round to your first?
BERNHARD LANGER: The first day I made some putts, and today I found it difficult to get the ball near the hole on these outward nine the wind was so strong, I never got the ball anywhere near.  I always had 50-footers, 80-footers, and hit two beautiful shots on five, a drive and a 9-iron, and the ball wouldn't -- again, I had 100-foot putt, three-putted, which was really a birdie hole today.  And that hurt.  But I played very solid, no bogeys.  Had plenty of opportunities.  Hit most of the greens in regulation, and toward the end we got a nice break.  The last three or four holes the wind kind of dropped and it was a lot easier than it would have been about three hours ago.
Q. You mentioned the conditions for the weekend supposed to be windy again and wet.
BERNHARD LANGER: Any other good news?
Q. No, hey.  That may be good news.  You won in Wales last year in these conditions.  Does that give you a little more confidence heading into the weekend considering what happened last year?
BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I've played in all sorts of weather.  And most of us have.  When you get to our age, you're doomed to have some of the worst, and Wales was some of the worst for a period of time.  And I hope it's not going to be that bad on the weekend, but we'll deal with it whatever comes our way.
Q. Should be a fun show.  Thank you very much.
BERNHARD LANGER: You're welcome.
