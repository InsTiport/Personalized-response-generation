Q. 66, you must be very happy?
HAYDN PORTEOUS: Yeah, you know, I wasn't in until a week, two weeks ago, and when I came out here, the plan was to expect nothing and take everything.  Just go out there and free it up, and a few putts went in.  Found a really good golf swing for the week, and hopefully I can carry on with the same sort of form.
Q. Was that the key?  Was putting key today?
HAYDN PORTEOUS: Yeah, I made a few really good putts out there, especially the knee wobblers from 5-foot and in, which was pretty solid.  Kept the momentum going with some good par saves and made the birdies that I needed to make, especially on the par 5s.
Q. A few mud balls, did that affect you in any way?
HAYDN PORTEOUS: Yeah, I flight it pretty high; Joburg boy.  So I was picking up quite a bit of mud.  So I did have a word with the referee at some stage on the course, and pointed out that, you know, there was maybe a little bit too much mud; it was quite excessive.
So we'll see about tomorrow.  Hopefully it does dry out, if not, then hopefully then we can place.
Q. Overall happy with the start and looking forward to the rest of the week?
HAYDN PORTEOUS: Yeah, it was great.  It's a great week to be here and hopefully I can carry on the next three rounds.
