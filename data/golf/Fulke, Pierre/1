Q. Pierre, you shot under par at Carnoustie yesterday, yet changed both your driver and your putter for today. Can you explain?
PIERRE FULKE:  Well, it was not so much the clubs, I was coming off two weeks off and hadn't touched the clubs back home and I was just a bit rusty really. It is easier to blame the clubs! I got this new driver off Ping that I put in the bag today and it worked fine and the new putter is just a different one I have used on and off for a while, and I think the greens here need a little more loft on the putters. I also changed my putting style today a little for here today which worked as well. They will both be in the bag again tomorrow though.
Q. Four top 15s in your last five outings, you must be encouraged by that?
PIERRE FULKE:  Definitely, I am playing nicely and hitting good shots and the putter is what has been bad even though I have been in the top 15. If I can get my putter working for four days then I will be all right.
Q. Highlight of the round was the 16th obviously, talk us through that one?
PIERRE FULKE: That was fantastic. I had 140 metres to the front, 30 back to the flag, 170 metres and I hit a little six iron and it bounced up beautifully and it rolled right in like a putt. It was a great moment.
