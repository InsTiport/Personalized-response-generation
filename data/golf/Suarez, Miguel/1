 Q.   Just talk about your round today.  
MIGUEL SUAREZ:   Today was I mean very bad hitting.   You know, I hit it so bad, but you know, I shot 74.   I kept it in play hitting it really bad.  
   
 Q.   What's your goal tomorrow?   Obviously you got some work to do.  
MIGUEL SUAREZ:   Yeah.   I need to play good and shoot under par and make the cut.   That's my goal right now.  
   
 Q.   Was there anything that wasn't working in particular today for you?  
MIGUEL SUAREZ:   No.   My driver was off completely and my irons were off.   
But at least they were straight off.   I kept it in play and I didn't make any big numbers.  
   
 Q.   Now, I don't know if you see him, but Rafa is 4â€‘under right now.   He's having a good day.   What would it mean to have one of the four Puerto Ricans really do well this week?
