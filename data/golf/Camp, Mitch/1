  Q. This is your first PGA Championship?  
 MITCH CAMP: Yes.   
  
  Q. You got it in the books. Probably didn't finish off like you wanted to, but overall?  
 MITCH CAMP: Overall was okay. The last hole was not very good. But a little shaky. Sitting around all day yesterday didn't help. I thought I would handle that a little better, but obviously I didn't.   
 So I'll have a better afternoon. Get some rhythm this afternoon, get 18 straight holes in, hopefully. And it's a little easier than waiting all day. But very good. Very good.  
  
  Q. So your experience here overall?  
 MITCH CAMP: It's been great. It's been fabulous overall. It's been good. Nice pairing. Fun to play with Rod. I played with John in the Big-10 championship. The last time I did that it was 1980.   
 So it was a nice pairing. Two old friends that I hadn't seen in a long time. So it really was a nice pairing. I hope I play better this afternoon.
