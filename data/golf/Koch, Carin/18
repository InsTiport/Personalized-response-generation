Q.  Carin, funny sort of day really.  The match didn't go your way, but overall how does it feel?

CARIN KOCH:  The match that matters went my way and the team's way, yes.  It feels great.  Obviously I'm out early.  I wanted to give Juli a match.  She's probably the best match player in the world, so I knew it was going to be tough.  I gave it to her a little bit too easy, I thought.  The way it ended I don't have to think about it anymore.  I'm just so excited right now.


Q.  To be a Swede and win the Solheim Cup in Sweden.

CARIN KOCH:  It's awesome.  These crowds have been just great.  The weather, everything's been great.  There's no comparison.


Q.  Tell me a little bit about the team spirit amongst the European camp because that seems to have been evident this week?

CARIN KOCH:  We have such great team spirit.  There's people that you don't see all year, you don't know them very well, because they only play in Europe.  Most of us play in America.  We just all come together.  It's a great team.  We don't have to put any effort into it.  It just happens every time.  I think that's why we do so well the first two days.  And this year we managed to do really well in the singles.


Q.  How significant is it that you went into this final day a full three points up?

CARIN KOCH:  I think it's very big for us because of the history of the singles.  I also think we had a really good plan this week.  Catrin was fantastic as the captain.  I think we just kept doing what we were planning to do.


Q.  Wonderful to watch.  Thanks very much.

CARIN KOCH:  Thank you.
