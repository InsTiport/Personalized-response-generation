Q.
Carin, I suppose you shouldn't be surprised.  You and Sophie have played 12 foursome matches and never lost one.

What's your secret?
CARIN KOCH:  You know, we play well together, and we had fun today.  Sophie had some beautiful iron shots.  I didn't putt like I did yesterday, but the greens were beautiful.  If you get it on the right line, the right speed, the greens are really true, and they'll go in.
Q.  The momentum's with the Americans for the moment.  What can we do to get it back?
CARIN KOCH:  What we did yesterday, I guess.
Q.  Wish you luck.
