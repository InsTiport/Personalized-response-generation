Q.  Laura, how do you feel?  Are you disappointed not to win the match or grateful to get a half?

LAURA DAVIES:  No.  We dominated the match pretty much from the word go.  We had a couple of pulled holes at the front towards the end of the back 9.  We had so many chances to win the match.  I think they're very pleased with the half and we're disappointed with the half.


Q.  And towards the end they managed to go 1-up?

LAURA DAVIES:  I have no idea how.


Q.  Really?

LAURA DAVIES:  We were inside them in the, I think 11 of the first 13 holes.  We had chances, 7 or 8 of those to win holes.  We just couldn't make a putt.  Down to the last.  I hit my first putt a bit too hard and left Carin way too much to do.


Q.  Carin, do you feel the same sense of disappointment?

CARIN KOCH:  I do.  I really wish I would have made that last putt.  I think we earned  -- we would have earned the match.  And after making the putt on 16 and Kelly made two really good putts on the last two holes.  So she really saved them there.  For us not to make par on the last, that's tough when we were ready play.  That's the way it is right now.  So at least we didn't lose the whole point.


Q.  Even so can you not look up at the score board and see the two points that are there already there.  Overall you couldn't ask for more?

CARIN KOCH:  No.  Overall I love that blue on the board.
