Q.   You were within one of Adam Scott.   Did you look at the scoreboard?   Did you know?   Did it matter?
CHESSON HADLEY:   I wasn't really paying attention.   But, no, it definitely didn't matter.   I was just trying to‑‑ I don't know, everything felt good, so I was trying to make some more birdies. 
And I'm a little disappointed in the finish.   I think the putt on 14 could have gone in.   I felt like it hit something.   And I totally had a mental error on the 3‑footer.   I was sitting over there, man, I could miss this right, and then I did, like an idiot.
I played really awesome all week.   Three rounds in the 60s out here is something to be proud of.   I don't know what Adam is going to do on 18.   But I think I was five back. 
So, you know, there's going to be some nasty flags tomorrow, and if I can shoot 4‑ or 5‑under you never know.   Just go, get a good night's sleep and see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   You look so comfortable out there from my vantage point.   What about inside?
CHESSON HADLEY:   Yeah, I did.   I felt really‑‑ I just felt really calm out there.   And I think that's important, especially for tomorrow, as well.   Just get off to a good start, hit some good shots early and get comfortable, settle in. 
These greens are so nasty that you can‑‑ I mean, you know, I had that 5‑footer on No. 17 and playing defense, because you can't really jam it in there.   You could roll that thing ten feet by the hole if you wanted to.
It was a great day.   And like I said, let's just go and see what happens tomorrow.
