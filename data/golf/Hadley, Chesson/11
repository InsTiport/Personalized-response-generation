Q. I was waiting for a finger snap today, I finally saw it at the end with you finished on 9, but I'm sure you gave it to them on 16.  But let's talk about your round overall.  Not your best ball striking round, but, boy, the putter saved you today.
CHESSON HADLEY: Absolutely.  Any time -- if you drive the ball well you can get away with things and if you putt the ball well you can get away with things and I was certainly able to do the latter today.  I putted exceptionally well and I kind of saw the line and had the speed right from the get-go.  I did hit some good shots, but my driving was poor for sure.  I just need to find some more fairways tomorrow and certainly over the weekend, we're not even to the weekend yet, but if I want to compete over the weekend, I'm going to need to find a few more fairways.
Q. I don't think I've ever seen what happened to you on 5 happen to anybody.  Have you ever seen that before?
CHESSON HADLEY: No, but I tell you what, I got lucky.  I hit a terrible drive and then I kind of fatted my whatever out of the desert, just got over the hazard, and it was just in the rough.  I was trying to land it five paces on the green and it was going to roll all the way back to the flag.  Well the rough is super dry and thick here and it grabbed my club and turned it over.  It was probably a good break/bad break.  That ball was way left of where I was trying to hit it, it could have gone in the bunker, but it certainly stopped in a hurry.  And it stopped, honestly, right where it needed to be, because I knew if I was just like a foot off the green about a hundred feet away I knew that was a perfect spot to make that putt, so.  Did you hear any sarcasm in that?  Catch any of that?
Q. You made it, so you get to say how you planned to do it.
CHESSON HADLEY: Absolutely.
