 Q.   Chesson, 5-under par 67 1st Round.   Did you get all you could out of that one?  
CHESSON HADLEY:   Yeah.   I made -- I think I made everything I was supposed to make.   I did miss -- it wasn't a little par putt on the last hole.   But, you know, that kind of leaves a sting a little bit but that's good.   Leaves me something to be fired up about tomorrow morning.   So, great round today.   Played so bad here last year.   So to be able to get off to a great start and, you know, get a little bit ahead of the pack early was good and great.  
   
 Q.   What were the course conditions like?  
CHESSON HADLEY:   Perfect.   The fairways are a little bare but the winter was so, so tough here.   But the greens are smooth, they're great.   Perfect making putt speeds.   I was able to make quite a few today but, you know, there wasn't that much wind.   It was 75 with 50 percent humidity.   It was just absolutely perfect out there right now.   
Great start today and obviously I'd love to shoot 5 everyday.   I think I'm going to like where I'm at on Sunday but --  
Q.7-under is leading.   Are you surprised with the benign conditions there wasn't a lower score so far?  
CHESSON HADLEY:   No.   This is a really hard golf course.   7-under is really golfing your ball well.   Even though the wind is not blowing it's still tough.  
   
 Q.   Obviously for you, terrific round, North Carolina native.   You didn't finish the way you wanted to but overall you got to be pretty pleased with what you did.  
CHESSON HADLEY:   Absolutely.   I played so bad here last year and, you know, honestly just to be under par is -- seems to be like a small victory so I played great today, hit a lot of good shots.   I putted extremely well and certainly happy to be in the house at 5-under.   I'm just excited about carrying that momentum over to tomorrow morning.
