MODERATOR:  Thanks for joining us.  Right now you're tied for the lead.  Can you give us some opening comments and then we'll take some questions.
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: I started out on 10, hit a very nice drive, hit it in there an 8-iron in there about 12 feet, and I made the putt for birdie.  On 11, I hit an 8-iron into the hole at 138 yards, and I left myself about a 35-foot putt, and I made it.  I've got a local caddy here this week.  They've got great caddies here.  We're doing a good job reading the greens together.  Anything else? 
We'll go over the next birdie, 17, a 9-iron 118 yards, hit it in there about 12 feet and rolled it in.  And 18, par 5, I had 243 to the hole and hit my 3-wood on the green and left the putt hanging on the edge for eagle and tapped in for a birdie.  Number 3 was the par 5, and I had 95 yards in, and I hit a 52-degree wedge in there, about 10 feet and made the putt for birdie.  That was about 10 feet.  And then on number 5, I hit  -- I had 135 yards, 8-iron in there, probably about 6 feet, made that putt for birdie.
MODERATOR:  Questions?
Q.  It's a pretty neat card there.
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: That is really nice.

Q.  For this golf course, that's pretty darn good.
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: That's nice to have a round like that, you're right.  I'm pleased we avoided the mistakes, and the golf course is in excellent condition.  I have to compliment Michael Scott, the greens superintendent, and his staff.  They did a really good job.

Q.  Can you talk about the difference between having a local caddy and having a regular caddy?  Is it just you rely  on him more to read greens?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: I have a regular caddy, and he's out on the West Coast.  He's probably kicking himself right now, so we talked about it, and I'm just playing this week, and I'm taking a couple weeks off.  I'm not going overseas.  I came here and I was supposed to have somebody else, but it didn't work out.  I met Avery on Wednesday.  He's just a real good caddy, and we seem well together.  Maybe we knew each other in another life.  This is my first week away from my kids.  That might be helpful too.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: Oh, yeah, my little daughter, the baby, turned 1 last week.  She's not here, so I don't have to think about changing diapers.  I don't have to worry about cooking, doing the laundry, getting up in the middle of the night and giving a bottle.  My husband is back home with the kids, and my sister-in-law, aunt Mary, and her daughter Molly flew down from Michigan, and they're staying with the kids.  My older daughter is 8.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: He's a real estate appraiser, and he's probably playing golf right now, conducting business.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: No, my most competitive round is a 63.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: It was when I won the tournament in '97.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: You know, I have had one top ten this year.  I took all last year off because I had the baby.  Earlier this year in Los Angeles, I finished 7th or 8th place I think.  I had some good rounds there and played pretty well.  The courses are similar, more traditional.  You have to think about where you leave yourself.  I guess I like that. 
You know, I don't know.  It really didn't rain that hard.  The rain that did come probably helped the greens.  The greens actually got firmer yesterday afternoon I think.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: Right.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: You just have to play that day to day.  For myself, if I played so well like I did today, I should try and do the same thing.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: I think so.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: Yes, sir, it was in Los Angeles.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: My bank account's getting low, so  -- I mean, what do you guys do when your bank account gets low?  You start working, that's right.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: You know, I don't know.  I guess I changed a driver.  I have a new driver in my bag and a new sand wedge.  The short game is kind of my game.  I was miss-hitting some wedge shots.  I think that's helped me.  I made the cut in Atlantic City, and I saw some progression.  I elected not to go out to Vancouver and come out here.  Yeah, I was expecting it.  I like this golf course.  I play well here in New York.  I love this golf course.  You know, you would have to check the record book on that.  I think I've only missed it a couple years, two pregnancies and one, I don't know why, but I love it here in New York.  I caught a show last night.  Went and saw "Moving Out," Billy Joel.  It was great show.  Had dinner at the ESPN2 sports bar.  That sports bar, that's just for women.  I'm going to go see the Yankees tonight.  
Roger Clemens is pitching tonight.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: Absolutely, I think so, and I think Juli Inkster has done a really good job of doing it.  Her husband, and a great nanny and her parents.  You have to have a great support system.  It's helpful not to have them here because I can be selfish and focus on golf.  You're right, you do just do the best you can.  I know there's times when Juli has to withdraw from tournaments because your kids get sick or whatever happens.  Fortunately, I haven't had to do that yet.  If I had to, I would.  They're worth the sacrifice. 
MODERATOR:  Any other questions?
CINDY FIGG-CURRIER: Thanks you guys.
