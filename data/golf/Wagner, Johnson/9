Q. What were your thoughts as you were coming into this week about how you wanted to perform?
JOHNSON WAGNER: Well I missed the cut last week and got some really good week in with my coach, Bobby Heins at Old Oak.  I was stressed out coming in here Monday.  I work with a sports psychologist, Gio.  We talked and I'm playing great, and I expressed that and wanted to put 125 out of my head, and thought I could contend.
I really wish I could have made a better run today.  But man, Ryan and Ben are playing great.  I've not had a great year.  I am very excited to be going to Barclays, and my game couldn't be better.  So I'm jacked about the opportunity to go win Wyndham next week and make a Playoff run, finally.
Q. Does it change the mind-set knowing, step one is done, and now you can just focus on winning and not just maintaining?
JOHNSON WAGNER: Absolutely, that's the goal every week; no to the play for your job.  But PGA TOUR, these young guys out here are so good.  It's becoming harder and harder.  You play good golf and you just get lapped out here.  I'm fired up to keep my job another year, and I feel like I'm ready to win another golf tournament.  It's been four, five years.  So I'm ready to get in that winner's circle again.
