 Q.  Johnson, great day.  That is the blueprint, the formula.  Bogey-free, assault the par-5s.  Was that the plan?  JOHNSON WAGNER: Absolutely.  Par-5s were playing kind of downwind.  16 and 18, and 2 was very reachable.  Just got to take advantage.  Hit it in the fairway.  Greens were a little softer this morning, so, yeah, had a lot of good opportunities, and always good to get a bogey-free round.   Q.  Walk us through your approach, second shot on 18.  We had you at 185.  That thing never looked like it left the flag from our angle.  Walk us through that.  JOHNSON WAGNER: It was just a perfect number, 178 front.  So it was a perfect 7-iron, and I knew it was going to cover.  Wind was helping off the right, and I could just throw it out there, and let the wind bring her back.   Q.  Thoughts for the weekend?  Game plan stays the same, change anything, or just a good night's sleep or keep it going?  JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, the putter has been working the last three weeks, so I'll do some work this afternoon with Juan and make sure everything's in check.  So, yeah, fairways and greens, and roll some balls in the hole.
