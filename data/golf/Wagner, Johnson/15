Q. Talk about your ruined today and your mindset for tomorrow?JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, it was there.  I'm happy I didn't make any bogeys.  I warmed up great, and then it was pretty much a struggle with my swing all day.  Fortunately made some good pars, and I made a few birdies and hung in there.  It's hard to contend with a guy who's just won two majors and shoots 61 on Saturday, but I feel like I'm in striking distance, and if I can get the putter hot and strike the ball a little more solid tomorrow, I think I've got a good chance.Q. Talk about your day a little bit.  Couple of delays.  It didn't bother you at all because you didn't tee off till later.JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, I woke up this morning and looked outside and it was dumping rain and saw my buddy, Ryan arm or teeing off by himself and playing 16 holes in the rain today, and then get out here with the delay, and it couldn't have been better.  The only thing I had to complain about were the mosquitos, so it was a great day.Q. Talk about the mindset going into tomorrow, other than knowing you have to throw up a low number.JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah.  I would like to have gotten a couple more, been a little closer.  Would have been nice to be in the last group.  But I got hot yesterday out here, and I know I can get hot out here.  So let those guys sleep on the lead tonight, and hopefully I can make a run at them.
