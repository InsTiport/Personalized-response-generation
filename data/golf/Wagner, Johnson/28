 Q.     Johnson, nice playing today, 4‑under par 66 got you to 10‑under par, talk about the eagle at the last, that was huge?  
JOHNSON WAGNER:   Hit a lot of greens today and had a lot of good opportunities and just tried to stay patient.   Kind of my new deal, it's very clichÃ© but I get real frustrated when putts don't drop.   And just a timely putt drop and get two quick strokes under par, it was great.   It was a good day and I love playing with Spencer and just had a great day out there.   
   
 Q.   This is a fun golf course to play, you're a ball‑striker and you like to figure out a golf course, and you were able to do that this week.   Your thoughts going into Sunday?   
JOHNSON WAGNER:   The golf course is playing so good.   I played really well here my rookie year in 2007 and it was firm and fast just like this.   I think we had more tradewinds, but when this golf course is firm like it is, it is just tailor‑made for me.   I just love playing out here.   
So, I'm excited about tomorrow.   I hope the wind blows a little bit.   I like the wind, so windy, firm, Waialae, I like it.   
   
 Q.   Is there a harder set of fairways to hit, maybe Colonial, on the PGA TOUR?  
JOHNSON WAGNER:   I don't know, I play at home in Charlotte at Quail and they are pretty tough, but I can't think of any harder fairways to hit.   I've probably hit six or seven really good drives this week and they just go through real quick.   But it's what make it so good, jumpers out of the rough and firm greens, you just have to be committed to what you're doing.
