Q. The day overall, you've got to feel really good about it, 7-under par?
JOHNSON WAGNER: Absolutely.  I'm striking the ball really nice.  Putts were lipping in today.  I got a lot of good breaks.  Got a little aggressive on the chip on the last.  Was trying to hoop it.  But my caddie and I work on leaving chips in the appropriate spots, and I left it seven feet above the hole fast as can be, so it was a little disappointing, but great day.  Love playing here in Canada.  Happy to have a chance this weekend.
Q. Speaking of putting, you made eight birdies out there.  Your iron game must have been spot on.
JOHNSON WAGNER: Iron game was great.  Had a lot of -- a couple kick-ins, really short ones.  Just a few mid-range putts.  Just seemed to find the hole.  Everything was going well.  And I've already forgotten about that.  Well, not really, but almost.
Q. You've been out here long enough, you sit outside the Top 125 number.  Is it pressure that you feel the last month or so, or how do you deal with that?
JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, I mean, this is not new territory for me, but it is my fifth tournament in a row, fifth cut made in a row.  I've been in really good position every -- after Friday every week and just not getting it going on the weekends.  I think kind of trying to -- not force it, just nervous, wanting to not mess up, wanting to play well.  It's got to happen for me sometime these next three tournaments, so there's no time like the present.  I may not get another chance like this, so it's time to go out this weekend and take care of business.  I'm ready to be aggressive and go try to win a tournament.
