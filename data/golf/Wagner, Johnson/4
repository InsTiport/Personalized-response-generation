JOHNSON WAGNER: Went to a movie last night with my family and waiting for a family to come out of a different movie, my kids want to play claw games.  I've never gotten anything out of a claw game.  Four straight attempts, I won something.  My wife actually said, "Let's go buy a lottery ticket."
Q. (Inaudible)?
JOHNSON WAGNER: 3-wood off the tee and had 97 yards.  Hit a lob wedge.
Q. What does this week feeling like holing out and getting attention?
JOHNSON WAGNER: I tend to play pretty good when I know what I have to do and I know I need a high finish this week so I wish at the beginning of the year someone would just tell me you need to finish 6th or better this week and you'll -- I don't know.  I know what I need to do and I'm trying to make that happen.
Q. Harold mentioned you played with him yesterday and turned out -- you feel the same way?
JOHNSON WAGNER: We play a lot of practices rounds.  We beat up on Carl Pettersson and Jason Bohn week on Tuesday.  I got off the a good start.  He was kind of slow and steady and picked up on the back-9 and made a couple birdies together and Harold is -- he's one of my heros out here.  I love him, love playing with him and I wish we were playing together tomorrow but I'll be watching him on the leaderboard.
Q. To be in contention you kind of focus on winning or --
JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah.  I think I need to finish 9th.  Not that I know (laughter).  But, yeah, I'm happy to give myself a chance to win and if I don't pull that off, hopefully I'll keep my card but I'm definitely going -- going out tomorrow with the idea of, you know, having a chance to win coming up the 18th hole.
