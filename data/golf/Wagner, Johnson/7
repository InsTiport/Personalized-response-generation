 Q.  64, you have to be happy with that?  
JOHNSON WAGNER: Absolutely.  My career low is 66 here at the Bethpage.  I shot that in the 2001 Met Open.  The goal for the week was to get to that number at least one day.  This golf course is so hard.  Had perfect conditions.  Drove the ball on a string today.  Made a lot of putts.  It was a perfect day.   
 Q.  Tied the tournament course record, and of course you obviously have some history; has to be even more special?  
JOHNSON WAGNER: Absolutely.  I figured once I made the birdie on 15, I figured I was pretty secure.  I couldn't mess up the last three bad enough to play my way out of Deutsche Bank.  Really was grinding to make a couple birdies coming in.  I wanted to make a 63, but whatever, I'm happy.   
 Q.  What kind of momentum is this moving forward?  
JOHNSON WAGNER: It's huge.  The golf course is long out here, and I think coming off the last two weeks, I tried to hit the ball a little further off the tee this week, and today, after a good session yesterday on the range, went back to just hitting the ball -- I hit it plenty far when I just hit it solid.  So just hit the ball solid.  I play Deutsche Bank really well.  I can't wait to TPC Boston and keep this Playoff momentum going.
