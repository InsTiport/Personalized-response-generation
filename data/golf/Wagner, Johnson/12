 Q.  You seemed to bring out some really good ball-striking rounds, and today was no different.  
JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, I played really nicely.  Hit a lot of greens.  Missed maybe two, including the last, which was a frustrating.  But hit a bad drive and made a lot of putts today.  Speed was incredible on the greens.   
Just, yeah, really happy with the start.   
 Q.  You referenced the greens conditions out there.  
JOHNSON WAGNER: They were a little soft, but we were third off on the front so they were probably the best greens I've seen in a long time.   
Got a little bumpy on the back, but I was rolling the ball so well I didn't see anything.   
 Q.  And your thoughts on the Plantation golf course tomorrow for your second round.  
JOHNSON WAGNER: Yeah, it's a good course.  I've played to a bunch in years past.  Come down to Sea Island for years and it's a good golf course.  Very gettable.  Wind is supposed to be up, so we'll see what it gives us.
