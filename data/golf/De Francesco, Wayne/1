 Q. Tell me about your round. 
 WAYNE DE FRANCESCO: I was a 1-over after nine. And then just started missing some shots and you can't miss anything here. I got a couple of iffy breaks and not making many pars out here. You got to hit every shot good on the hole to make a par.

 Q. With this wind and the rough is this almost too unfair or too challenging?
 WAYNE DE FRANCESCO: No, you could play it. You could play it. You just had to hit exceptionally good shots all the way around you couldn't get away with much of anything. 
 So, yeah, I mean this course is right in front of you. I wouldn't say it's unfair. It's just golf. It's just hard. You take a Major test and put a bunch of wind and cold weather on top of it, it's just going to be extra hard.
