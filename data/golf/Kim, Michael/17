Q.   Comment on your round. 
MICHAEL KIM:   Yesterday I was 2‑under going to the suspension.   I had a par chip on 4.   I actually made an 8‑footer for par on 4.   I putted really well today and yesterday, and I'm in good position.

Q.   Are you surprised with where you are after two rounds?
MICHAEL KIM:   Yeah.   I didn't really expect to be‑‑ I think I was in 13th last time I checked.   It's pretty cool. 

Q.   Did you check the leaderboards at all?   Obviously the numbers in Round 2 are going up and up.   You had one of the best four or five rounds today?
MICHAEL KIM:   Yeah, I didn't really check.   I checked last night.   And these leaderboards, they mostly show the leaders like Donald and Horschel.   So I didn't really see it.   I mean, I just tried to focus on my game and that's about it.

Q.   How is the course playing?
MICHAEL KIM:   It's tough.   You miss the fairway, you're lucky to hit it on the green.   The pin locations are getting pretty tricky and the greens are speeding up. 

Q.   Is being low amateur a goal of yours?
MICHAEL KIM:   Yeah, obviously Pan is doing well right now.   We have a few more rounds to go.   So I could get last.   You just don't know. 

Q.   What are your thoughts heading into this afternoon?
MICHAEL KIM:   Just the same thing.   One shot at a time and trying to hit as many fairways as possible.

Q.   What has been the key to your success the first two rounds?
MICHAEL KIM:   Just been really steady.   Hitting a decent amount of fairways and greens.   I've been putting pretty well.   These greens are really tricky.   And I think putting is one of my strengths and it's been working so far.
