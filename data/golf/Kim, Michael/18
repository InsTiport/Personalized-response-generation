Q.   Talk about your round today.   You had some great putts. 
MICHAEL KIM:   Yeah, I got off to a pretty solid start, parred the first few holes and I definitely could have made birdie on them. 
And then hit a poor drive on 14 and just made a bogey. 
But made a really good birdie on 16, kind of came back. 
I just tried to get through those 14 through 18 stretch in even par, because you're making shots on the field at that. 

Q.   Your goal coming in obviously to make the cut.   How is everything progressing towards that?
MICHAEL KIM:   I'm not sure.   Trying not to think about it too much.   Low expectations and whatever happens, happens tomorrow.
