Q. Talk about your round.
MICHAEL KIM: Hit it great all day.  Putted well all day.  Looking forward to a good Sunday.
Q. You put yourself in position to be into the mix, looking for that first win.  What experiences in the past will you lean on with 18 holes remaining?
MICHAEL KIM: Right, just lean back on my college wins, back at the Cal-Berkeley days, which you know a lot about.  You know, it will be a new experience.  I'll probably be a little nervous, but I'll try to embrace it and see what happens.
Q. Where do you think your game will be with those nerves and the chance to win?
MICHAEL KIM: You know, hopefully I'm prepared.  You know, the game felt good all week, and I'm sure it will extend to tomorrow.
