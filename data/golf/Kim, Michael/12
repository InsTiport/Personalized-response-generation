 Q.  Would you say that was the longest two days?  
MICHAEL KIM: Yeah, conditions were brutal.  Brandt summed it up pretty well.  He said it was a British Open conditions and a U.S. Open setup.   
And I mean, I can confidently say I've never played in anything harder than this.  And it was tough two days, but glad I went through it and looking forward to next year.   
 Q.  Growing up on this course and seeing those trees all down, that was a little strange, right?  
MICHAEL KIM: Yeah, it was crazy.  Like the big tree on 15 there came down and that hole's just never going to be the same.  That tree kind of made the second shot a little tougher.  But just seeing trees and the roots, taller than me, on the ground, is pretty crazy.   
 Q.  For you, is this -- you said it was the toughest conditions, but what made it so tough?  Was it the wind?  
MICHAEL KIM: Just a combination of everything.  The wind, the rough, the PGA TOUR didn't really help us out with the tees being pretty -- a lot farther back than I thought.   
Just the wind made everything -- your misses worse and so even some of your good shots turn out in the rough and missing the green and such.  So, just a really tough day out there.   
 Q.  Do you think the two hour push back also -- because it seemed like the wind really kicked up at 10 again.  
MICHAEL KIM: Right, we were thinking that the wind was going to stay comfortable, and then kind of right when we were about to go off it started getting windier.   
When I was playing the 14th hole, 13th hole, it got pretty bad.   
And my ball on the 16th hole was moved right when I was trying to mark it.  So did Jonas' on 18.  So the wind was howling out there for sure.
