 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
J.L. Lewis:   We have been friends for many, many years.   Great guy, good player.   And had a hell of a career out here and I'm just kind of struggling along trying to stay in the game.  
   
 Q.   What's it like being on the course with him?  
J.L. Lewis:   It's pretty quiet, we don't talk much on the course, we probably talk more off the course than we do on.   It's good camaraderie, but it's not an ongoing conversation, I wouldn't say.
