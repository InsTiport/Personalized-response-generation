   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sophie, thanks for coming in and joining us today. Another great round out there for you, 69-68, 7-under par so far, and you're tied for second. Can you talk about your round and specifically those two eagles you had on 11 and 18 today? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Well, very happy with 4-under because it's tough out there. Very happy. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Great round, especially in these conditions, to have two eagles on the back nine is really impressive. Can we go over your scorecard starting with a birdie on the 9th hole? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit a wedge to about 20 feet.

 Q. The eagle on 11, your first? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit a 4-iron to about five feet.

 Q. Then the only bogey on 13, what happened there? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: That was a three-putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far was the first putt? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I would say 25 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And then the remarkable finish, the second eagle on 18, what a finish in front of a good crowd. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit 3-wood to about 45 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And you made that putt? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Wow, that's great. 
 We'll take questions for Sophie Gustafson. 

 Q. Was there a rule on 9 where you got to place your ball -- I'm sorry, on 18? Was it casual water or something? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: No, I wasn't sure if I was on the fringe so I could pick it up and clean it. 

 Q. First of all, you did a lot better than the Yankees did today. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Oh, really? 

 Q. Yeah, they lost to the Mets. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Oh, well.

 Q. Do you usually like to attack the par-5s? Is that part of your game? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Well, I'm fairly long hitter, so that's obviously my strength. So if it's doable, I'll go for it. 

 Q. Did you have good chances to go for the other par-5s? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Like we had one that I was in the -- the 5th, and the 7th I was on the right, yeah. 

 Q. On the 45-footer for eagle, were you trying to make that or were you just trying to lag it close?
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah, lag it.

 Q. Was it a big breaking putt, or was it kind of just a straight --
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it was probably a four-foot break left to right.

 Q. What's with the Yankee hat and shirt? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I'm sponsored by Major League Baseball.

 Q. So you wear different Major League Baseball teams?
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

 Q. Different every day? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Well, in the New York area I wear Yankees.

 Q. You're a long hitter, one of the longest hitters out here. Baseball seems like a -- a home run, is there any link between your sponsorship with baseball and the fact that you hit the ball a mile? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: No (laughter). But I can't throw any good, though. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Thanks for your time, and congratulations on a great round.
