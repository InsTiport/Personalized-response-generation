PAUL ROVNAK:  Terrific round today, 9 under par.  We were just talking that that's a career record for you, and it's also a tournament record.  Now you've just put yourself into contention and you have a good shot at this thing.  Just if you can go ahead and talk about that, and we'll take a couple questions.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Well, I actually played about the same yesterday.  I putted awful yesterday.  I actually gave away my putter.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Who did you give it to?  (Laughter).
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  But it was nice to be able to make good shots.
Q.  Did you already have another putter somewhere in your bag that you pulled out for today, and had you used it before?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yeah, it's my old putter.
Q.  It obviously worked well.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yes.
Q.  Were you more comfortable with it?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yeah.  Just the other one wasn't.
Q.  How long did you have the other one, the one that you threw away?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  That was my    probably my second round with it.
Q.  Was this an autograph seeker that you gave it to?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yeah.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Was she surprised?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yes.
Q.  What kind of value are we talking about, the putter?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Well, I don't know, you can see if you can find it on eBay.  (Laughter).
Q.  It sounds like once you changed out the putter, got rid of that, you said you played well yesterday except for the putting, did making change help you mentally or were you rolling the ball different with a different putter today?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  I think it's a combination.  My coach was here until this morning.  So when I got finished yesterday, we worked on it.  It's a combination.
Q.  Did you know you shot a record for the course, or you didn't know until you came in?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  No.
Q.  You knew it was good, though, right?  Did you think it was that good?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  I didn't know it was a record.  It rained on the first hole, but it wasn't that bad.
Q.  Obviously not.  Do you play well in the rain typically?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yeah, yeah.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Can we go over the score card if you don't mind, Sophie.  You started on No. 11.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yeah, I had a wedge to probably eight feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  14, the par 5.  Did you get home in two?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  No.  I hit a 56 degree wedge to two feet.

15, I had a 9 iron to about six feet.

18, I 2 putted.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you hit 3 wood or 7 iron?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  7 wood.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you know how far your birdie putt was?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  First one was probably 40.
PAUL ROVNAK:  2, the par 4.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  I hit a sand wedge to eight 18.
PAUL ROVNAK:  4, the par 5.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  That was probably 30.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Another par 5, No. 7.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  That was a 2 putt, 6 iron.  The first putt was probably 45 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And then you birdied your last hole on No. 9.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  I hit an 8 iron to maybe 18 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  So you made some long putts today.  The new putter worked well, or the old putter worked well.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  The other one was absolute rubbish.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you, Sophie.
