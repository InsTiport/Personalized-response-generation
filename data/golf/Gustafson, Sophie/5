 Q. Can you talk about your round and what happened out there from your perspective? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: It's obviously a disappointment to me here at Annika's tournament. It's not much more; I didn't have a good day. 

 Q. Was there anything that wasn't working in particular for you today? Anything you weren't hitting good? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Everything. 

 Q. Can you talk about the approach for you today, mentally coming into today? Were you nervous or did you feel like you were going to play it safe or aggressive? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I was just wanted to do what I had the last three days, but then obviously that didn't work. 

 Q. You got off to a good start. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Uh-huh. 

 Q. And what happened --
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I don't know what happened. 

 Q. Did you make any putts today? Was that a problem? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: (Away from mic.)

 Q. All in all, can you describe the week? Was it a success finishing in the top handful of players? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: No, I can't. I mean, if -- if I would have come from behind and shot 66 the final day and finished fourth, I would have been happy. 
 But having a 6-shot lead going into the last round and finishing fourth, it can't be much else than a disappointment. 

 Q. Was the course playing any differently today than it was the last two days in terms of pin placements or wind, pin positions? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: No, I felt it was very similar to yesterday. It was the same wind. That's basically what -- I mean, the biggest factor that makes this course difficult.

 Q. Was there a particular point in time or hole where you felt that you were pressing or getting nervous about the rest of the pack catching up? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: After the 10th, I had trouble the middle, and then on the 11th, I had a 5-foot birdie that I missed. 

 Q. How much scoreboard watching were you doing today and when did it start?
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I wasn't looking until like the 14th.
