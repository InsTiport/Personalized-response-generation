 Q.   Well played today.  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   Yeah.   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Are you happy with your position?  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I am, but before I was going out, I was thinking a ten would be a good number to get to.   And that was what I was working towards.   
   
 Q.   I mean you've had an up‑and‑down season.   What would it mean to win here tomorrow?  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   It would mean a lot.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you have a good chance?  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I mean obviously Alexis is going to be hard to beat, but if I can keep playing well, then I think I have a good chance.   
   
 Q.   So what do you think of Alexis's sort of play and her game because obviously she's billed as the new star of women's golf.  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   She is a fantastic ball striker, and if she just keeps working on the little things and doesn't start changing something major, then I think she's going to be really good.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you are a long ball hitter as well, I mean I guess different background.   What were you doing at her age when you were 16 and does she remind you of yourself in any way?  
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:   Yeah.   I think the only way that she does remind me of myself is her power.   
I wasn't anywhere close to being as accurate as she is when I was 16.
