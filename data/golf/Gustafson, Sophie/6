   MIKE SCANLAN: Great round out there and nice birdie on 18 to tie yourself for the lead. If you would, just tell us how you played today. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Well, I hit it really awful but I managed to score well. 

 Q. Are you playing with a lot of confidence now? 
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Not really, actually because I have not been hitting well after -- I will go practice after this and see if I can figure it out. 

 Q. You say that you're trying to figure it out but a couple weeks ago you finished second to Lorena and it looked like you were playing pretty well in that tournament, as well. 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah, that tournament -- I should have picked up my clubs during my off week (laughter). 

 Q. Does it go away that quickly, for some of us who never know what it's like to have it, does it disappear real quickly if you don't continue to hone in on things? 
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: But I hit horribly -- I will have to try and figure it out.
