PAUL ROVNAK:  Sophie, thanks for coming in and speaking with us.  You won here in 2000, so you're familiar with the course, and you're the last person to win here on our tour.  You're 3 under now and you're winning again, so you obviously must like this course.  Can you just talk a little about that maybe?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Well, I'm not sure there's a lot to say except that it's actually my favorite course.
Q.  Is it nice to be back on the European Tour?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yes, it is.

I actually think that I have been playing better than what my scores have shown.
Q.  Inaudible?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Sure.  Kind of, you know, it's kind of hard, but if you are playing ahead in the fairway, it's not.
