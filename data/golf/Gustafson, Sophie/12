JOEL LAMP:  We have Sophie Gustafson here in the interview room, 6 under par 66, leading the tournament right now.  Sophie, we'll start off with your score card.  Birdie at No. 2.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  That's a par 5.  I hit an 8 in there, and I chipped it up to about 15 for birdie.
JOEL LAMP:  Let me ask you this.  The 8 iron, was it short of the green in two?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yes.
JOEL LAMP:  You followed that up with a birdie at 5?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  It was also a par 5.  I hit a 9 iron in there to about 28 feet and I had two putts.
JOEL LAMP:  Birdie at 6?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  It was wedge to 15 feet.

JOEL LAMP:  Birdie on 17.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I was about 16 yards.
JOEL LAMP:  What club did you hit there?
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Lob wedge.
JOEL LAMP:  It looks like your iron play was pretty good today, knocking it close a lot.  Just your general thoughts about how you played today.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I played good.  I was excited about this week.  Even though the course is short, I was going to play aggressive.  I hit a lot of drivers, so I didn't really have very far for my second shot.
JOEL LAMP:  Questions?
Q.  (No microphone.)
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Yes, it is.

Q.  (No microphone.)
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  The last 18 months I have had some health issues.   IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve won four times in the LPGA and 11 times in Europe, so IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve been in this position before.
Q.  (No microphone.)
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  I'm just hoping that we will have the same weather.
Q.  (No microphone.)
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Kind of.  I think the only explanation for that is the wind.
JOEL LAMP:  Any more questions?

Thanks a lot, Sophie.  Congratulations. Great round.
SOPHIE GUSTAFSON:  Thank you.
