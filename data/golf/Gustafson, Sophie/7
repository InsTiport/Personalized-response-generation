   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sophie, thanks for coming in and joining us today, another great round out there, tie for second place. Can you just talk about your finish and maybe a little bit about 18?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Well, I'm quite pleased. I shot 3-under on the back nine, so I'm happy about that. It was good to putt a little bit of pressure on Lorena the last few holes.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You definitely put the pressure on Lorena coming into the final putt on 18. Can we go over your scorecard, starting with your first birdie on the 4th hole?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit an 8-iron to about seven feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 5.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit my second shot in the water and two putts.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 8.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Three-putt.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far was the first putt?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Maybe 30 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 10.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit a 7-iron to three feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 11, birdie.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: 11, I two-putted.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Two-putt on 11.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah, from about maybe --  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far was the eagle putt?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: 12 feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 13.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: That was a wedge to about 15 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 14.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I missed the green and chipped it and two-putted there.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far away was that?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: The first putt was probably maybe 18.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And the birdie on 16.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I hit a wedge to about 10 feet.   
  
  Q. How far was the putt on 18 for birdie?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I would say that was about 12.   
  
  Q. Did you misread it? Did you hit a good putt like you thought?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I didn't hit it.   
  
  Q. Did you feel a lot of tension on the back nine, and if so, how did you manage it?   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: I actually felt relatively calm when I started to play and was trying to think about two things, patience and attitude. That was what I was trying to focus on all day.   
  
  Q. You had the opportunity to hit first into 18 with the approach shot, and when you hit it pretty close, did you expect Lorena to respond like she did?  
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. You've seen that enough?  
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Yeah (laughter).   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sophie, thanks for your time. Great play this week.   
 SOPHIE GUSTAFSON: Sure. Thank you.
