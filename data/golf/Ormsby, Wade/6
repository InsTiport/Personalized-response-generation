  WADE ORMSBY:   Just happy to be here this week, with a back nine like that straight out of the box was nice.   Great start.   
   
 Q.   Ever had anything quite like that?   
WADE ORMSBY:   Well, the last few weeks I've had quite a few hot runs.   Perth I had five in a row on Sunday and last week in the first round, I had four in a row.   I said to Rich after four in a row‑‑  
   
 Q.   This is eight on the back nine and there's a bogey thrown in there as well?  
WADE ORMSBY:   On 12 I drove it left and kicked into a bush and had to take an unplayable.   So no, it was fantastic.   I holed about a 15‑footer there for bogey and then, yeah, just kept on making putts coming home so it was perfect.  
   
 Q.   Been a good, busy time for you with Hong Kong and Australia and India last week?  
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, exactly the event I won last year, Panasonic Open, went back and defended that.   Nice lead‑up to here.   Similar time zone, so I thought I would throw that in on the way over here, try to give myself a bit of match preparation and didn't finish the tournament off as I would have liked but game is it in good shape.   Nice to get a good start this week.   I had a pretty crazy day, Monday, worked hard yesterday, played nine yesterday morning.   Game feels pretty good shape.  
   
 Q.   Ambitions?   Targets?   Looking for Dubai next week?  
WADE ORMSBY:   Sure, still keep on trying to play as good of golf as I can and all that stuff takes care of itself, all the old clichÃ©s.   Game feels good.   That's the main thing.   It's nice to have a crack at things when your game is in good shape, you can try and tick some of those boxes but I'll just keep trying to do what I'm doing.   
Probably didn't hit it as good as I could have off the tee, but that's one of my strengths, driving it quite straight.   And I drove it okay, but nothing like I had the last two days.   So might do a bit of work on that but overall pretty happy.  
   
 Q.   Is this one of the best streaks you've been on with consistency going from week‑to‑week?  
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, I think the last few weeks has been good.   I think I turned the corner.   I think the back end of Europe, I made a lot of cuts but didn't get myself into the mix, a lot of 30th, 40th 50th places so the game is really not firing right there.   I knew the game was close.   I just had to get it going again.   Ball‑striking dropped off a bit, but hit a lot of good short irons and wedges stiff today so that makes a bit of a difference on the scorecard.
