WADE ORMSBY:  Only missed two greens today so the up and down on the last was nice. It's nice to save par when you miss them. On the range I was struggling and early on I was just trying to find my rhythm. The wind picked up as it did in practice and I was just trying to get it in position on the fairways. The scores were lower than I thought.

I have been up there a lot but only a few decent finishes. Last year I struggled in  the middle of the year and this year I have tried to really focus in the big tournaments in this part of the season and play well in the big events.

Had a week off last week and went to the British Grand Prix and then went and watched the Aussies give the English a good thrashing at the Oval. It was good. I know Ricky Ponting a little as he plays a bit of golf.
Q. Have you seen much of Adam Scott?
WADE ORMSBY:  I actually spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon. I was hitting massive cuts on the range and phoned him to say I can't find my rhythm. He just told me to complete my shoulder turn and that would make it easier to turn it back. I have been working on that and it is doing the trick. We played Junior golf all the way through and he helps me out a little bit along with my coach back home. Just little tips you get from players out here all week.
