 Q.   Nearly completed your second round, but looks like you're going to have wait.   How difficult was that?  
WADE ORMSBY:   Well, the weather was pretty nasty.   Really depended where you were on the golf course.   Even though I was going along nicely, the wind whipped up there on No. 5.   Snuck away from there with a par and 6 is the next toughest hole out there and I drove it in the water and scrambled out of there with a bogey so I got out of there unscathed compared to what it could be.  
   
 Q.   The horn blew on your 17th hole and you have one extra hole to play tomorrow and a lot of the field won't have many more holes to play‑‑  
WADE ORMSBY:   Depends what the weather does.   If this weather sticks around with this amount of wind, I'm sure I'll have an advantage with less holes in the wind.   We'll see, 9 is an accessible pin.   Go out and have a crack at it and see how we go from there.  
   
 Q.   What's your assessment of your play?  
WADE ORMSBY:   Game feels good.   Driving it pretty good, could have a little more control with my ball‑striking.   Wedges are dialed in this week.   Hitting them pretty close and then I'm rolling the putter pretty good so overall I'm pretty happy.   Not trying to tinker with my golf swing at all.
