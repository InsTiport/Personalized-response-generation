Q. After the start you had, it must be satisfying to have the finish that you had?
WADE ORMSBY: Yeah, sure, it's a bit of a grinder's golf course out there, and it's the kind of weather it is, too, just have to keep on trucking along.  Did a good job of that today.  Made a few putts towards the end and putted pretty solid all day, even though I had a slow start.
Q. Do you relish the challenge that a golf course like this poses?
WADE ORMSBY: Yeah, definitely.  I love this place.  I love putting this on my schedule.  It's always a week I feel like I can get around the front, sort of give myself a chance on Sundays and that's what I'm trying to do.
Q. A tough couple of weeks just before the break, was there anything in particular that you were working on back home?
WADE ORMSBY: You're always working on stuff, yeah.  I didn't play that poorly in India.  I just had a really unfortunate finish.  It is what it is, you know, given my position, I feel like I'm trying to push new areas of my golf swing trying to get better.  Sometimes you take a couple of steps backwards, but the ultimate goal, going forwards, so all good.
Q. As you made a run on the final few holes, were you watching the leaderboard as your name slowly went up there?
WADE ORMSBY: I had a look on 14 or 15.  Thought if I could get to 3- or 4-under would be good and to finish at 5 was a bonus.  Had a good look at the last, too, and missed that.  Just nice to hit some good shots the last five holes.
