Q.   Two good consistent rounds for you.   You must be happy? 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, it's good.   It's a big event and you always want to play well.   So my game felt all right.   I'm not really taking the ball striking from the range to the course, which is frustrating me a bit.   But the putting is solid, so it's keeping me in there.

Q.   You've played this golf course before; how do you find this golf course? 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, it's a good track for me.   I generally hit it pretty straight.   So it should be a good course.   Maybe my ball striking doesn't feel as good as it could be.   But like I said, the range has been great.   It's just between the ears, I've got to sort that out and I'll take it.   Hopefully keep the hot putter and work my way in there.

Q.   Good position to be in the last two days, isn't it? 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, it's always good.   It's nice to try to be in the mix with them and try to play with some great players and try to work your way up towards the front.   But, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   It's a great event.   So it's fun.

Q.   Is it your first time playing this event? 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, obviously, it's a fantastic event.   Lot of these guys over here, lot of them I know from my college days, so it's good to see how you match up against them.

Q.   Anyone in particular that you get to catch up with? 
WADE ORMSBY:   There are two guys on my college team that are actually on the bags for other players.   Ryan Palmer's bag and Jimmy Walker's bag.   So it's nice to catch up with some of those guys.
