Q.   I take it that's usually satisfying to do what you did at the last and put yourself right up there?
WADE ORMSBY:   It was nice.   Caught it a little bit thin but Richard said not to tell anyone, my caddie.   I had a good number in there.   Thought it could be a mini‑flyer and I thought, just commit to it, and if I get a flyer, it would have been on the back edge, so nice to catch a little spinner in there to a couple inches.   

Q.   Effectively tap‑in to lead the championship, which must be very tasty. 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, my game feels good, made a lot of birdies out there today, made a few little soft mistakes early on but overall pretty happy.

Q.   I know Wentworth is an entirely different course but it is the tree‑lined nature.   I recall you playing so well there.   This just seems to appeal to you somehow. 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, the courses where you have to keep the ball in play appeal to me.   Get a little bouncy‑‑ obviously don't hit it that far, so if I keep it between the trees, I feel like I have a pretty good chance around these type of places.

Q.   Were you looking at the leaderboards? 
WADE ORMSBY:   Yeah, the first time I looked at it was on the 10th hole, and yeah, I was a couple back and I thought I made a couple mistakes and that's kind of where I thought I should be.   Game was good and knew I could make some birdies coming in. 
Just keep the ball in play, and some pins you can't go at, 16 was tough today to get it close, and definitely 17 and 18 if you got the ball in play, you could have a crack at it, so it was nice.

Q.   What do you reckon to the final day?
WADE ORMSBY:   Just keep doing what I'm doing, try it give myself in the mix with a few to go and if all things go to plan, I should be near enough.
