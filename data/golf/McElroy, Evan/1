Q.   A very disappointing two days for you obviously.   What's been the problem out there? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Just struggling to get it in the fairway mainly I suppose.   As firm and as fast as this golf course is, if you're not hitting the fairway, you've got a little problem hitting it close to the flag.   It's just kind of a bad first nine holes both days. 
I kind of rescued the situation last night a little bit coming in.   It was just a quick turnaround from a 9.30 finish last night to an early start this morning, and I just didn't come out of the blocks this morning very fast at all.   Hit a couple of‑‑ hit two loose shots in the first nine holes, which is my back, and 3‑putted 18 and hit it in the water on two.   Trouble from there. 
So very disappointed.   This course has been so good to me over the years.   Just not to be this year but that's golf.   It's a work‑in‑progress.   Keep grinding and big summer ahead.

Q.   It's been a disappointing season for you so far; is it just a matter of being patient and keep grinding, or are you thinking of changing things up? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   How do I keep grinding?   I've got a lot of technique in my head, I've got to be honest, and I have to strip that out.   I'm having problems stripping it out.   I've got to get back to basics a little bit and try and clear the mind a little bit.   Just been working too hard on trying to get the technique fixed and making it worse. 
But I've just got to strip it out, back to basics.   I've got a lot of golf to play.   Just need courage in my pocket, get out there and work it out.   I know it's in there.   There's a little bit of clutter in there right now, but that's golf.   You take the rough with the smooth.   It's been a great three or four years.   I'll dig this out and I'll be back.
