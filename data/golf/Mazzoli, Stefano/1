 Q.  2-under par in the first round of the U.S. Amateur is probably something you're happy with.  
STEFANO MAZZOLI: Yeah, I was really happy, really pleased to be here.  First of all, it's a great tournament, it's probably my last tournaments as an amateur and so it's a nice first day, nice to start in this tournament this way for sure.   
 Q.  The birdies that you made, you had four, and were any of them really, really good ones in your mind and what did you do to get the birdie?  
STEFANO MAZZOLI: I feel like I had a really good up-and-down on No. 6, probably, the par-3.  That made me go into the next hole, I made birdie.  So that was really two key holes for me during the round.   
And then I had the really good birdie on 13, the par-3.  That was a really good one.   
 Q.  How close did you hit it on that one?  
STEFANO MAZZOLI: It was probably 18 feet I would say.   
 Q.  The golf course, the way it's structured, it's hard, it's firm.  
STEFANO MAZZOLI: I feel like it's a fair golf course.  Obviously you're going to hit a bad shot in this stuff, the rough here can be perfect, it can be really unplayable, but if you play well you can score.
