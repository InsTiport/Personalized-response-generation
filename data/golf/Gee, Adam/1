 Q.   Nice to get off to a start like this?   
ADAM GEE:   Nice, played quite solid.   Hit the ball in the right spots as you have to do out here, and nice to make a few putts, so, yeah, pretty standard actually.  
   
 Q.   Good to be back‑‑  
ADAM GEE:   Oh, yeah, just keep looking at the golf course you're playing, the hotels, you're in, yeah, it's very nice.   Certainly makes a change from some of the places where you're sort of slogging it, trying to save a few pennies here and there.   
   
 Q.   You say "slogging it"; I guess that's been the career for a little while.   
ADAM GEE:   Yeah, yeah, it has been.   
   
 Q.   You've always known your talent.   
ADAM GEE:   The way the strength and depth now, playing tours around the world, everyone can play.   Everyone knows how to put numbers together.   So it's just trying to keep your head above water and when you have a good week, just press on and keep your foot down.  
   
 Q.   What is the approach to a new season?   To put the foot down straightaway?  
ADAM GEE:   I don't know.   Every day is different.   You wake up a bit older, every day, your body feels a bit different from the day before.   
So just clichÃ©s, enjoy it, every day as it comes and just keep‑‑ just stop making silly mistakes and keep out of my own way.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you've learnt some lessons along the way?  
ADAM GEE:   I don't know.   My report card at school would suggest otherwise.   I don't know if wiser and older go together in my case.   I hope so.  
   
 Q.   Are you enjoying the fact that it's here at Fanling?   
ADAM GEE:   Yeah, fantastic golf course.   Really, really good.   You don't play too many sort of old‑style courses like this where it's fast, bouncy.   You get on the wrong side of some of the flags and it's devil's own job to get it anywhere close, let alone up‑and‑down.   It's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Are you good at that discipline?   
ADAM GEE:   We'll see.   There's a long way to go.
