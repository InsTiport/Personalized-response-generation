Q. So, Mark, it was kind of a roller coaster round today, a little bit of a tough finish, but you're still in the lead.  How would you sum up the round today?
MARK MULDER: Well, roller coaster.  I shot, I think, a 68 with two doubles.  So that's kind of the way it goes sometimes.  I hit a few bad shots, and they cost me.  So you pay the price.  This new format is a tad bit different, I guess.  It's not minus 2, so that helps a little bit.
But for the most part, I knew I had to get closer today to John and Mardy, and I think I did that.  With this format, it's a lot harder to come back on guys.  But with the weather tomorrow, I mean, to be fair, anything can happen tomorrow.
Q. It looks like it's shaping up to be a bit of a pitchers' duel between you and John Smoltz out there.  Do you think you'll be able to take him out tomorrow?
MARK MULDER: He's playing great, so I just need to focus shot to shot.  I know it's very cliche-ish, but it's true.  Make some good putts and see what happens.
Q. Do you think it's going to be hard to focus in and get in the zone tomorrow with all the chaos going on?
MARK MULDER: It's not going to be hard.  What's going to be hard is the weather.  I know it's supposed to get worse from 8:00 a.m. on every hour.  So depending on the winds, you're going to have to be able to hit some golf shots tomorrow, which for a lot of us athletes, it's not what we do.  So it's going to be a challenge for us.
