Q. Tell us about your round. 
MARK MULDER: Started off very slow, a lot of pars, mixed in a bogey, then kind of the weather's rolling in and out. Grinded a little bit, and then I made a few birdies, had a couple eagle putts, left those short. That's always great. Then kind of battled my way back. Then I doubled 18 for minus 2 points. 
But other than that, I was happy with it. And I'm happy with what happened today because I didn't hit it great. I think I had 21 points. So all things considered with the way that it went, I'm cool with it.

Q. And what was the double out there? 
MARK MULDER: Just we had so much wind in our face off the right, I tried to hit a draw and play that wind and played a little too much, and it went in by a couple feet. Got a little too greedy, tried to play it out to the right, and just overdrew it.

Q. Any birdies that stand out? 
MARK MULDER: No, there wasn't any that were great. I mean, I had a good eagle putt on 10. I had a birdie‑‑ so I birdied 10. I birdied 11. And then birdied 14. So I had a four‑hole stretch there where I made 3 of the 4. From then on, those were my only three birdies. 
And other than that, it was just kind of a ho‑hum round. Made some good putts, but everything was 30 feet. I just didn't hit anything a whole lot close to be aggressive with.

Q. And can you talk about playing with Gerina. If you notice anything about her game. Was she‑‑
MARK MULDER: Well, she's pregnant, for one.

Q. She is. That's what I meant. 
MARK MULDER: Let's not let that slip. But she hit it great, all things considered. I was asking her, are you going to be playing in a few weeks? She was like, nope, I'll be at home, as she should be.

Q. She's probably hitting a lot of woods. 
MARK MULDER: Exactly. So for her to be here, it's incredible, and she hit it great considering the conditions.
