 Q.  You're back in the hunt as defending champion.  Is it harder to be a defending champion and defend, or is it harder to win it for the first time?  
MARK MULDER: Probably harder to defend.  I played really good today.  Just couldn't make any putts.  The greens were incredibly difficult.  They were in perfect condition.  And just all those 10 --15-footers I had, I just couldn't get them to be close enough.  I was a little tentative on all my putts, but for the most part I'm very happy, happy with how I played today.   
 Q.  How are you feeling after round one?  You're only a few points behind.  Wagner's got 27.  What are you looking forward to tomorrow?  
MARK MULDER: Yeah, I'm perfectly content with where I'm at.  Being in, I think, the top three right now, I'm fine with that after day one.  It's totally cool.  Like I said, I missed a few today, but there's two more days.  There's no pressure.  I felt I was real confident today.  I was really relaxed, which was a very nice feeling as compared to recent years.
