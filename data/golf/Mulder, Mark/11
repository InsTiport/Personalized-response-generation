Q. So it looks like you're going to come up just shy of John Smoltz.  How did you play today, do you think?
MARK MULDER: Well, he deserves it.  I didn't play all that great.  I was grinding but just a handful of short missed putts, a couple bad drives.  The two 6s that I made on -- I think I made them both on the front nine.  I had two 6s, and then I three-putted No. 10, the par 5, after hitting it in two.  Those are the ones that absolutely kill you.  You can't let that happen.  So I kind of put myself in that situation, a little too far behind, especially with this format.
Q. Were you keeping track of what Smoltz was doing out there today?
MARK MULDER: I was trying not to.  My brother, who was on my bag, just constantly kept reminding me of where everything was.  I'm kind of that person who likes to keep their head down and not pay attention to what else is going on.  So he was letting me know, I guess you could say.
Either way, it doesn't matter.  I just didn't quite hit the shots that I needed to hit.
Q. Can you tell me about the experience this week, how fun it's been and all that?
MARK MULDER: Every year it gets better and better.  Diamond Resorts has done an incredible job.  What they've created now with the LPGA Tour is something special.  It's fun to be a part of.  I feel very lucky to be a part of it and fortunate all at the same time.
