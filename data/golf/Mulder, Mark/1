  Q. Looks like you had a great day today.  I think six birdies, if that's correct.
 MARK MULDER:   I think, yeah, it was six with a bogey.  I threw in a bogey on 17.  Not sure how that happened, but it does.  That's the way it goes.  I at least got it going.
 Last couple days have been a struggle, so today was a lot better.  Nice to see some balls actually go in the hole.  Hit some shots where I was trying to hit them, so it was moving in the right direction.
 But it's still a long ways back.  It was nice to at least get back into it.
 Q. And it was raining off and on today.  How are the course conditions?
 MARK MULDER:   Course was awesome.  My rain gear, my umbrella, is all doing great in my hotel room.  I did not think it was supposed to rain at all.  I brought it but I didn't think about putting it in the bag so I didn't have it.  My brother who is caddying for me, we just wore it all day.
 But, you know, it must have worked.  So I played well.  The conditions are what they are.  There is nothing you can do about that.  Hopefully tomorrow go out and have another good day.
 Q. Talk about tomorrow a little bit.  Obviously you've won this event, and just how you feel going into the final round.
 MARK MULDER:   Well, I haven't seen a scoreboard so I don't know where Mardy is at.  I'm sure after the first two days I'm still quite a few points back.
 With this scoring system, with no minus points, it's kind of hard to catch somebody when they're playing well.  I would assume even with my getting 40 or 41, whatever I had, I would assume I would have to be 10 to 15 behind Mardy tomorrow.
 So there is no catching him as good as he's playing.  But second, third, fourth, whatever it might be, hopefully I can go out and put up a big number and see what happens.
