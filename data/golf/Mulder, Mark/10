 Q.  You guys are always at the top.  Here you are second and third, and here we go again, so one of those.  It's the first time he's been able to finish ahead of you guys.  
MARDY FISH: It's also nice to have different winners.  Romo won in Tahoe, and Smoltz here.  It's not easy to win these, and so it's nice.   
MARK MULDER: We had our chances.  We had chances.  We didn't take advantage.  He did.   
 Q.  I said to Smoltz yesterday, I said, hey, if this was any of the other events, we'd be giving you a trophy.  Then he goes, this is a four-round tournament?  
MARK MULDER: Exactly.  It's a little different.  It's more of a grind with four rounds, but it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Overall, as far as playing with the ladies, give me the impression over the week real quick.  I mean, as far as the format.  
MARDY FISH: I mean, straight, long.  Brooke Henderson, I played with her three days.  All of them were so nice, and every one of them that I asked loved the idea of playing with the athletes and celebrities and stuff.  So it seems like everyone had a blast.   
 Q.  And you guys too.  Here we go next year.  It should be a lot of fun again.  
MARDY FISH: Absolutely, yeah.  We're playing with the best players in the world.  I played with the No. 1 player in the world yesterday.  It was pretty awesome.   
MARK MULDER: I got lucky three of the days.  I think I was playing with first, second, and fourth place girls going into the final rounds.  That's who I got paired with.  I think it makes it that much better.
