 Q.  We got four days versus three this time.  How does that impact you, Fish, better players, versus maybe the other level guys, or what do you think?  
MARK MULDER: Well, I heard the format's changed a little with the points, trying to close the field down.  It's another day where you can try to separate yourself.  Obviously, that's what we're hoping for.  That's what I'm hoping for.  It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it just gives you that extra day to put up a good number.
