Q. Another day still in the hunt, not as good as you wanted obviously, but you've got two more days to get them back.
MARK MULDER: Yeah, I left myself in a lot of tough spots today.  Didn't hit it all that great, but that's the way it goes.  I mean, you've got to find a way to hit some shots.  A few times I did, so to bail myself out, especially on hole 17.  The one bright side, I'm probably not going to hit it this bad the next two days.  Let's be honest.
Q. Well, like I said, you're still in the hunt.  You're going to be four or five back probably.
MARK MULDER: Yeah, this format's a little different, though.  The further you get back, the harder it's going to be to make comebacks because it almost turns into a stroke play type tournament because, instead of it being a five-point swing with a birdie and a double, it's a three-point.  So that makes it a little tougher to gain on somebody, especially when the better players are not making double bogeys.
So for the most part, you've got to go hit a bunch of greens and hope you roll a bunch in.
Q. How about that caddie of yours?
MARK MULDER: My caddie is -- he's been better.  But you know, like I said, if I improve, he improves.
Q. And now I'll ask the caddie.  Are you ready for the 10 percent commission?
PHIL MULDER: How about the zero percent.  I got a raise this year.
