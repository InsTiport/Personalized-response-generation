  Q.  Looked like you had it going there for a while, you had to be feeling pretty good after that 6, 7, 8 stretch.   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, after that long putt on 9, it was like, wow, made me just -- I had a good look on 9 with a wedge on my hand.  Just really didn't have any good birdie looks after that.  A couple 15-footers, but it's tough.  I hit a 7-iron on 14 and just was a yard short.  I don't know what happened.  I hit into a bad lie, made double -- other than that and that 3-putt I played pretty good.   
  
  Q.  On the bunker shot --   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  I really was happy where I with was wasn't really too worried about it.  Maybe I took it too lackadaisical, and it's unfortunate.   
  
  Q.  Were you aware you were tied for the lead?   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  I wasn't watching the board but I figured I was pretty close.  I knew it was tough out there.  You know, I hit some great shot on the front nine, made some long putts so I'm happy with the week.   
  
  Q.  Two weeks in a row now you've been in contention, it's got to be an encouraging thing for early in the year.    
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, I feel great.  It's a tough golf course.  You're hitting 4-irons and 3-irons and hybrids into these par 4s and I'm not that long of a player, and obviously some of the players it's playing to their strengths but I'm happy, all in all it's a good week.
