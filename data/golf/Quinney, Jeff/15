 Q.  Talk about your round and when you thought I've really got something going if I stay within myself? 
 JEFF QUINNEY:  I made a good putt on No. 9.  I hit a poor wedge to 20 feet and holed the putt and got 4 on the front nine, and I was feeling in control of my game.  I knew where the ball was going and was comfortable out there. 

 Q.  Where does this rank on your best rounds? 
 JEFF QUINNEY:  It's got to be up there.  I shot 63 in the Phoenix Open, the FBR Open on Friday this year, to get the lead. 
 On this course you don't really expect to go that low, and this is definitely on top. 

 Q.  Sometimes players get in a zone, do you feel like you got in that zone out there today? 
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, I was definitely in the zone, I was at ease and calm.  Nothing bothered me.  You're not worried about the score, you don't realize how many under par you are, just one of those special days. 

 Q.  If it's you and Phil tomorrow both at 7-under, do you like those chances?  Do you like that pairing? 
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, you've got to like that.  Anytime you can play against the best, that's where you want to be.  Obviously two AZ Sun Devils playing at the top of the game, it would be a great battle. 

 Q.  Coming in with your round with your score after you had the first two, was there a number -- not necessarily an overall round number, but I'd like 3-under or 4-under after this round? 
 JEFF QUINNEY:  I didn't know the wind conditions were going to be that strong.  I think I would have been very happy with two or three under.  This is the type of course where you don't expect to go really low, but just one of those days where the conditions were there for the taking and I took advantage of it.
