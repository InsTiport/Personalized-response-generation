  Q.  Pretty nice start.   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, a good front nine.  You know, I was in control of my game, just felt pretty comfortable out there again.   
  
  Q.  Was it just kind of a continuation of the way you've been playing?   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Pretty much.  You know, I chipped in on the first hole.  It's a pretty easy chip, but sometimes you get just some good breaks going.  I got off to a good start.   
 I didn't take advantage of the par 5s for a little bit.  I didn't birdie any of them I don't think, so I left a few out there.   
 But all in all, pretty happy.   
  
  Q.  Scoring conditions today, were they just about ideal, or not quite?   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Just a little chilly warming up, the first couple holes.  Pretty ideal.  You know, the greens were a little bit more receptive with a little bit of rain from what I played on Monday or Tuesday.  They were running out, and you could fly some longer irons in there, which kind of made the wedges a little tougher because they were spinning back so much.   
  
  Q.  Your birdies, anything really -- you had a chip-in, but did you make any long putts?   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  I had a long putt on 7, the par 3, just kind of hit it in the middle of the green, probably made a 50-, 60-foot bomb.   
  
  Q.  Wow, that's a good feeling.   
 JEFF QUINNEY:  Yeah, back right pin, figured just kind of make 3 and run, and that was definitely a bonus there.
