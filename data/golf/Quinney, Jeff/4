  Q. Jeff, I'm sure you know you're right on the number, 125 right now. Guys still out on the course. What does that seem to be like?  
 JEFF QUINNEY: Little frustrated. I could have taken care of my own business today on the back-9. Got off to a good start, 4-under, was rolling.   
 Kind of been struggling on the 11th and 14th holes all week. Haven't been comfortable on those drives. I drew some bad lies in the rough and struggling to make pars and I wanted a couple coming in, but pretty frustrated.   
 Obviously the scores are just ridiculously low today and kind of pressing and we'll just wait and see, you know. In the airport, either going West or North.
