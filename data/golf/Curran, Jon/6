 Q.  66 in round three.  First question is how difficult were the conditions today?  
JON CURRAN: Yeah, I mean, the wind is obviously up.  I think if you watch telecast you see a lot of those flags whipping around, especially when you get close to the ocean, close to the water.   
But, yeah, I mean, the course is tough.  Some of the holes are playing a lot different from day to day because the wind will switch around.  One day you'll hit a 9-iron into a hole and the next day you'll hit a 5-iron into it.   
So, yeah, you got to adapt and hit good iron shots and keep it in the fairway.   
 Q.  You're at 9-under, only four off the lead at this point.  Are you controlling your golf ball pretty well this week?  
JON CURRAN: Yeah, I'm hitting a lot of good iron shots.  Seem to have.  I think I hit like six or seven 6-irons today for some reason.   
I am hitting a lot of good iron shots and controlling the distance well, controlling the flight.   
Yeah, I'm putting really well.  Made some good, long putts today.  It was good.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy playing in the wind?  
JON CURRAN: Yeah, it's a challenge.  I like playing at Sea Side.  This is one of my favorite courses to play on every since I was a little kid.  Played some junior tournaments and SECs here.  Regardless of the weather, it's a good place to be.
