Q.   Thoughts on starting your PGA TOUR career with a top 10. 
JON CURRAN:   Yeah, for sure it's been a great week.   I had a really good feel for the golf course all week, but it's awesome to come here to Frys and start the year off on a good note for sure, especially since I didn't end the year off too well on the Web Tour, but I was ready to come out here and get it going.   So yeah, I'm very excited.   It's been a good week.

Q.   What was the turnaround?   I think it was nine of 10 missed cuts on the Web.com TOUR and you played well here. 
JON CURRAN:   Yeah, honestly I probably played poorly two of those events.   The Web Tour is just so hard to make cuts sometimes.   I don't know, there's something about it.   It's just low scores, guys are good, cut to 65, so they cut to less people.   It's a grind. 

Q.   You had clinched your card pretty early.   Was it kind of an‑‑
JON CURRAN:   No, because the position you get from‑‑ you guys all know about the priority rankings and stuff, it's huge because there's guys that didn't get into this event.   They get their card but they don't get into the first event of the year, so I knew there was a lot to play for still, so I hung on.

Q.   So no big tweak?
JON CURRAN:   No big tweak, none whatsoever.   Just happy to be out here.

Q.   Did you hear from Keegan at all this week?
JON CURRAN:   Yeah, a little bit.

Q.   Anything you want to share?
JON CURRAN:   No, not really.

Q.   What was it about the golf course you liked?
JON CURRAN:   I got a lot of wedges in my hand this week.   My wedges have been so dialed this week.   I didn't particularly drive it well today.   Putted pretty good, had some good saves, but I had a lot of wedges, so I got the chance to get some opportunities.
