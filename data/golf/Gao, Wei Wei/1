Q. Wei Wei, great week for to you get to the quarterfinals.
WEI WEI GAO: Yeah.
Q. How do you look at it?
WEI WEI GAO: Like I see like I could have done a bit better because on 15 I missed a short par putt.  Wait, sorry.  15 I hit it in the hazard on the left side because I -- yeah, it was really bad shot.
On the next hole, 16, I hit a good tee shot on the green and then 3-putted it.  Yeah.  I hit it too hard over the hole.  My second putt just u-turned on the hole.
Q. And you made a birdie on 17, but he also...
WEI WEI GAO: He also birdied it.
Q. Yeah.  How far was the putt on 17?
WEI WEI GAO: It was like five feet.  Yeah, he putted first; went in.  Then I play next and also went in.
Q. Did you feel confident when you got off to a good start being 2-up after six holes?
WEI WEI GAO: Yeah, I felt kind of confident.  Like I just wanted to stick to my process when I was up by two, then like he was also playing really well.
Yeah.
Q. What impressed you about him?
WEI WEI GAO: Like he doesn't really get nervous.  Like when I got a birdie, he just remains calm.  When he gets a birdie also, I don't really react to it.
Yeah.
Q. Go back to you.  First USGA championship.  Was it everything you thought it would be?
WEI WEI GAO: Yeah, it's a really nice course and greens are really fast and stuff like that.
Yeah.
Q. What will this do for you in the future, do you think?
WEI WEI GAO: This made me a better player.  Like I experienced like people watching me.  It's a really nice course.
Q. Do you think you'll come to the United States more?
WEI WEI GAO: Yeah, I will.  And I'm going to win more tournaments.
Q. All right.  Good luck.
WEI WEI GAO: Thank you.
