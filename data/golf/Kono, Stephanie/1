 Q.  How much fun was that today?  
STEPHANIE KONO: It was a lot of fun.  I hit a lot of good shots and obviously I got the putter rolling.  It was just so much fun to play my last round here in Hawaii this year and make some putts.   
 Q.  All things considered - playing at home, this being the final day of a tour event - where did it rank for you in terms of all-time rounds that you've played?  
STEPHANIE KONO: Well, my lowest rounds ever is 64, so this isn't really far behind with a 65.  Obviously given that's it's the Lotte and the last day, probably one of my best rounds ever.   
 Q.  What was the difference today?  Obviously not far away yesterday.  What do you think helped that to get in today?  
STEPHANIE KONO: Like I said, yesterday I just didn't make any putts, even though I hit a lot of good ones.   
Today I just stayed patient.  Seemed like I saw the line really well and I just felt so confident over every putt.   
 Q.  Yesterday I asked you about taking advantage of opportunities.  Obviously you did that today.  What's next for you?  
STEPHANIE KONO: I'm not exactly sure.  I think I'm going to do the Monday qualifier in San Francisco in a couple days and see if I get into that event.   
Think I'll be in a few more events after that.  We'll see.   
 Q.  As far as your career goes and showing yourself what you can do in a tournament like this, does that give you some confidence moving forward?  
STEPHANIE KONO: Absolutely.  I mean, I never felt nor comfortable, more confident out there.  I just want to remember that feeling and keep moving forward.
