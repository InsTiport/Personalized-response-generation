Q. Cool to see all the fans and following you have.  You're the only local girl left in the tournament.  What's that like for you?
STEPHANIE KONO: It's awesome.  I mean, I didn't have a great day, but just to be out here with some friends and family and know that so many people support me just means so much to me.
Q. Still have 18 to go tomorrow.  What's the mindset?  What do you need to work on to get back in it tomorrow?
STEPHANIE KONO: You know, I hit a couple of loose shots today and I need it tighten that up.
I hit a lot of good putts but they just didn't go in today.  I'm just going to trust that my feel is still there and hopefully they'll go in tomorrow and have a good day.
Q. As far as your career goes, not too many opportunities like this to play in events like that, but taking advantage of it this week, how important has that been for you?
STEPHANIE KONO: It's been really important knowing this is the last tournament before the first reshuffle of the season.
It meant a lot that I made the cut yesterday, and hopefully I have a good day tomorrow so I can move up a little bit.
Q. How did you feel at the turn after the first nine holes?
STEPHANIE KONO: I bogeyed nine and I think that was my first 3-putt of the tournament.  You know, I was bummed I didn't make that par putt, but I still felt really good.
Like I said, I hit the ball not so great on the back nine, and so I was just kind of trying to keep it together.
But, you know, hopefully I'll work things out on the range and it'll get a little bit better tomorrow.
