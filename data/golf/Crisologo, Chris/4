 Q.  Chris, was there a lot of pressure here on these two holes that you played?  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: Obviously there is a lot of pressure just trying to get it into the match play portion.  You know, it was just different.  There are so many people and so many variables that can go on, and you got to stay focused and hope for the best really.   
 Q.  You hit a nice shot on 14.  Tell us about your tee shot.  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: I knew I had some room from the front to the back of the green, so I kind of took a little bit off an 8-iron.  I knew it would cover the bunker for sure.   
Put a good swing on it and ended up being around nine feet.   
 Q.  Looked like the putt caught the edge a little bit.  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: It just caught the edge.  Got a nice line from a playing partner over there, so I was fortunate enough to have that.   
So just really grateful to have an opportunity in this match play.   
 Q.  And now you've got Hayden Wood, the medalist, this afternoon.  A little time to rest, but I don't know if you've ever played him before.  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: No, but he's been playing really solid golf.  Hopefully we can do the same and it'll be a good match out there.   
 Q.  Obviously played Riviera this week before.  How does it suit your game?  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: There are a lot of scoring opportunities if you hit the ball in the right spots, hit it decently far.   
So just putting myself in a good spot.  A lot of these players, you see a lot of good scores out here.  Obviously you put yourself in a good spot and give yourself opportunities hole in, hole out, and that's just the golf course.   
 Q.  Would you say this is one the top moments in your golf career?  
CHRIS CRISOLOGO: Definitely is.  Just playing in a U.S. Am is always special.  Just really grateful to be here.
