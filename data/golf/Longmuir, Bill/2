BILL LONGMUIR: I am happy with it. I played well. I hit the ball pretty solidly but I had a poor finish with three fives. In general I am happy with the way I am playing. I love the way the course is and I am looking forward to the next three rounds.

The wind made it a little testing. I don't mind if it gets a little stronger. It will be interesting if it gets stronger.  Club selection will be a bit difficult.
