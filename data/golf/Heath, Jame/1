JAMES HEATH: I guess it was a good game.  3-under, 2-under out there.  Greens getting a bit baked, so couldn't really attack many flags, and I was in the semi rough on a couple of shots and couldn't get within 20 feet and couldn't get auto aggressive out of the semi.   
Hit great shots on 16 and 17 and great tee shot on the last.  I think I've done it to about three guys this week, birdied the last.   
 Q.  Talk us through 16 and 17.  
JAMES HEATH: Yeah, it's funny, my two brothers, they will laugh at this, but I tried to draw it on 16 and every time I've tried to draw, I've left myself in trouble.   
But with that left flag, I need to be aggressive both times early this morning and today, and I hit this lovely little draw; surprised myself.  And 17 is a stock shot for me, really easy tee shot for me.  Most of the guys I played with hit iron down there and I was able to hit an easy shot and get to the green in two.  Got to take advantage where you can if that's a shot you're comfortable with.   
 Q.  17 could easily have been two-shot or four-shot swing.  What were you thinking over that putt?  
JAMES HEATH: You're trying to keep your wits about you but as it turns out, only one-shot swing.  He's one of those guys you really don't want to play against.  He's unflappable.  I had a chance on 16, 17, but wasn't putting great to be honest.  I wasn't really making anything.  Holing out okay, but not making anything.   
 Q.  The loss is still quite raw, but what can you take from this week?  
JAMES HEATH: It's been maybe not so good on the course.  I'm one of those players, I love to make every single cut, every single week and have a stress-free life, but I seem to miss loads of cuts and get really down and get really down, and then come top five and want to play again.  It's just one of those things and I've got to deal with it.
