ANDREW LANDRY: I had an early morning tee time this morning, so I went to sleep pretty early, and my wife woke me up at 1:30 in the morning and said, hey, everything has been canceled. I was like, what? Looked at my phone, sure enough, got a message from the TOUR saying everything was canceled for the rest of the week this week and then leading up through Valero. So it's like pretty sad that this is all happening. This is a tough go-around. I know all the people from the PGA TOUR didn't want this tournament for sure to be able to go unfinished. A lot of preparation, a lot of hard work going into this event, and I know that Jay and all the staff at the PGA TOUR is doing the best that they can with this virus going around and taking precautions for our health and our family's health.   
It is what it is, and we'll just move forward and hopefully everybody can travel safe home and say healthy.   
 Q.  How do you process all the news around the world with being a father and a husband and realizing golf is fairly insignificant at this moment?  
ANDREW LANDRY: No, for sure. Like I said, we're going to go home, take our precautions and wash our hands and try to stay healthy and try to keep baby boy healthy and mama healthy and just go from there.
