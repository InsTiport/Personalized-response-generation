Q. Okay.  Andrew, halfway through, 7-under but let's just talk about that two-putt on the 18th.  You were all smiles after that one.
ANDREW LANDRY: That one was probably the hardest putt of the week there so far.  These greens out here getting lightning fast and you catch a couple putts out here where you just have to really focus on your speed and try to hit your lines and try to do as best as possible to get it down in two.
The green speed picked up obviously today and they were were getting it.  I'm looking forward to obviously faster and firmer greens throughout the weekend.
Q. Andrew, we've done the math.  A tie for 2nd, at the very best a two-way tie for 2nd will get you into the Top 125.  How does that factor into your approach on the weekend at all?
ANDREW LANDRY: It doesn't.  It doesn't.  You know, I've set my schedule to go to the Web Playoffs and that's it and if God has another plan, so be it.
Q. What is the strength of the game that has gotten you to this point in this tournament this week?
ANDREW LANDRY: You know, I think my iron game is finally coming back around.  Hitting a lot of greens.  Just giving myself opportunities and rolling in a 30-footer here and there and whenever I'm hitting it close, capitalizing and obviously I didn't do that good of a job today.
I hit a lot of shots close and didn't get it to go.  But the greens out here are really hard.  You can have a 6-footer that breaks four cups.  It's one of those things you have to kind of leave it in the right spot and you just have yourself a great opportunity.
Q. I know there's a lot of golf.  Go get the tie for 2nd.
ANDREW LANDRY: Thanks.
