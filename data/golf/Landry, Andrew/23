 Q.  Not many people knew about this man coming into the U.S. Open, but they know about you now.  How do you think you've held yourself out there on this very difficult golf course today given the circumstances?  
ANDREW LANDRY: Fine.  I think I did a really good job out there.  No nerves, very comfortable.  Playing (indiscernible) off of Dustin.  Obviously, he probably didn't remember me, but it was fine.  We had a good group.  We had lots of fun out there.  It was hard to make birdies out there with*, so we're just trying to -- I'm just trying to hit a bunch of greens and just give myself a lot of opportunities.   
I snuck one in there on like 7 or something.  Hit a bad shot on 9.  Kind of just hitting and trying to leave myself in the right positions to give myself uphill putts.   
I haven't really done that great of a job, but looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  The journey continues tomorrow, but so far, what have you learned about yourself?  What have you taught others about you?  
ANDREW LANDRY: I don't know.  I feel like I played good golf on hard golf courses where par is a good score.  That's just kind of my game.  It's always been my game.  It's kind of like Q school.  It's the same thing with Q school.  It's such a hard, long six rounds of golf.  You just have to stay really patient and try not to make a lot of mistakes.   
 Q.  What is your mentality as you get ready to put your head on the pillow tomorrow for a long day?  
ANDREW LANDRY: I'm fine.  I'm tired.  I'm ready to get some sleep.  I'm pretty pooped, and I'm ready to get some rest and get back out here.   
 Q.  You'll approach tomorrow how?  
ANDREW LANDRY: Same thing.  Just go and hit a bunch of greens and maybe the putts go in, maybe they don't.  So we'll see.
