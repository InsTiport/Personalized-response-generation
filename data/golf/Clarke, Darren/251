LEE WESTWOOD:   I played great, even on the front nine, where I shot 3-over.  I got unlucky a couple of times.   First, at the 8th, and my drive landed in a divot, and it cost me a 6.   Then again at 16, I hit two great shots close to the green, and my chip checked short.  It had been releasing all day, so that surprised me.  I hit good shots on last two holes, but could not make a birdie.  That is the way my day went.  I played great, putted great, but got no breaks.  I must have walked over a walked under a latter or run over a cat on the front nine.  I only hit one really bad shot at 7th.  The other bogeys and the double were caused by bad breaks.  
 
PHILLIP PRICE:  I played lovely for 12 holes, but it was scrappy for the last six.  I holed an 18-footer at the last for a par, which was nice, and I'm pleased to have made that one, because it helps me regroup and start again tomorrow.  The greens were firmer today and the pins tucked away, which made it a lot tougher.  
 
DARREN CLARKE:  I caught a few bad breaks today.  I hit the ball lovely, but missed a couple of fairways and a couple of greens.  I got a flyer at the 14th from the rough, which landed in the bunker and I had no shot and made bogey.  At the 16th, I clipped a tree and it went into the rough, and I had a horrible lie.  I chipped out into the bunker and from there; it was always heading into the water, for a double.  That sums up my day.  I hit the ball nicely, but didn't get much out of the round.
