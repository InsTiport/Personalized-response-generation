 Q.  You just didn't look this morning like it was any big deal being down 4-0.  Describe your emotions as you watched what happened this afternoon.  
DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, that's The Ryder Cup.  That's what all these people come to watch.  You know, historically, Europe have probably been stronger in the foursomes and America have always been stronger in the fourballs and that was completely turned on its head.   
As I spoke to you after this morning, the guys were disappointed with the way they played this morning and the way they performed.  But they showed tremendous bravery and heart and desire to go out and play the way they have done this afternoon.  As a captain, I'm extremely proud of them.
