 Q.  A disappointment to bogey the last but the story seems to go on for you? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  Yes I am playing much better as I've said to the media this past while. I didn't hit the ball quite as well today but my short game was very good and so to be able to shoot level par when I'm not playing my best is perhaps another sign that I'm moving in the right direction. I would have hoped for better but I am pleased with level par. 

 Q.  It looks like you'd want to play every week right now if you could? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  Yes definitely, I'm mad keen to get out there and play and for the first time a long time I am enjoying working on aspects of my game as well. If I could do I'd play all the time as you say but I think Tyrone and Conor (his sons) would be a bit annoyed if I kept on doing that so I'm going home for a week next week. 

 Q.  What has brought it all together for you? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  Just a combination of everything I think. I am more at peace with myself now I think, I am more comfortable with myself and all the work I've been doing with Ewen (Murray) has been really good. I have a new ball from TaylorMade which spins a lot less which means I can control my ball flight which is great and I'm just keen and eager and wanting to play golf which is great. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts on the year ahead? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  I just want to keep working hard on the things I have been working on and trying to be a lot more consistent on the things I have been working on and with the evidence of recently, I know I am doing the right things so I have just got to work on them, keep doing them and hopefully I can take my game to where it hasn't been before. 

 Q.  I think everyone in golf is willing you to succeed? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  I definitely trying. I'll get there.
