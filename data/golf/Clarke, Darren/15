DARREN CLARKE: This afternoon the roles may be reversed and the Europeans will go out and make some putts and get some momentum.
Q. Did anything happen this morning that caused you to send these afternoon pairings out or was that pretty much what you had in your mind that you wanted to do?
DARREN CLARKE: That was very much what I wanted to do this afternoon.  That was what I was looking to do.  With six rookies on the team, you have got to get them out and get them playing.  Nothing was different from this morning.  If it had been 4-0 our way, it would have been the same pairings going out this afternoon.
