   DARREN CLARKE: I had lots of chances today and played really nicely. I am in contention and enjoying myself a lot. The only worry is the weather forecast for tomorrow. They're talking of high winds, maybe even bad enough to stop play. And we are going to be at Kingsbarns which would be the worst to play if the wind really gets up so I suppose it's just a case of waiting to see what happens tomorrow.
