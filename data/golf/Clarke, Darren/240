DARREN CLARKE:   Finishing third is pretty good, the way I hit the ball for the first three days.  It was a lot better today and I made a lot more chances.  I had a couple of 3-putts midway through the front nine which stopped my momentum, but I still came back well and played a pretty good back nine.  It always looked as if third was the best could I do today, and that's what happened.  Four rounds in the 60s is a pretty good performance over this course.  For the first three days I pitched and putted my way around the course, but it was much better today, more opportunities.  Next week is going to be very tough for the guys playing in the BMW and trying to make the team.  But I think the side looks very good at the moment.  I don't really think it matters who gets there.  I thought I had to go really low today to have a chance, but these holes on the front nine stopped me.
