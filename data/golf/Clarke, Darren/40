  DARREN CLARKE:   I can't strike the ball any better than I did and I'm actually quite amazed that my putter isn t in two pieces.   I was going to do a Shane Lowry.   I can't hit it any better.   I just can't take any more putts on the green today.

Q.   Do you take encouragement from the fact that you are hitting the ball so well?
DARREN CLARKE:   Not really.   You can hit it badly and score.   At the end of the day, out here it's about the score.   Certainly it's more enjoyable to hit it better.   I'm just really, really frustrated.

Q.   Do you feel there's the opportunity for somebody to go to go really low?
DARREN CLARKE:   Well, there was this morning.   The wind is starting to pick up now and it's going to play obviously a lot more difficult.   But the course was there for some good scores this morning.

Q.   And overall how do you enjoy the experience of The Irish Open? 
DARREN CLARKE:   It's been fantastic.   The golf course has been great, spectators have been great.   All the guys have really enjoyed it.   It's a tough test but a fair test.   If you play well, you should score well, as long as you hole a couple of putts. 

Q.   How frustrating a day was that for you? 
DARREN CLARKE:   I can't really put it into words because you'd have to put too many beeps on whatever is going out on air. 

Q.   That bad? 
DARREN CLARKE:   Yes, I can't hit the ball any better than I am from tee‑to‑green, and I just can't make a putt from anywhere.

Q.   Is that a new putter in the bag today?
DARREN CLARKE:   It was a new old one.   It's currently still in one piece.

Q.   What's the cure, do you think?   Another change? 
DARREN CLARKE:   I don't know.   Maybe try closing my eyes tomorrow or something, I don't know.   But the ball‑striking was as good as it's ever been and walking off shooting 1‑over par is not particularly pleasing. 

Q.   Can you take much satisfaction when you hit the ball that well but you're just not making any putts?
DARREN CLARKE:   Been doing that for a while now, so the game is winning the battle at the minute. 

Q.   You're hitting the ball as well as you ever had, it's just that putter. 
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, it's not working at the moment.   The putter and myself have different ideas, and unfortunately there's nothing going in at all.

Q.   Could you understand Shane Lowery's frustration yesterday with his putter? 
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, we all get frustrated.   We all go through periods of not making any putts.   Mine's just been a bit longer than most.   It's frustrating when I play well and not scoring. 

Q.   You can take a lot of satisfaction out of playing here at the home open in front of all those fans?
DARREN CLARKE:   It's been a brilliant week.   The go course has been fantastic and everything about it has been really, really good.   To see so many people coming in and supporting the event at Royal County Down is brilliant.
