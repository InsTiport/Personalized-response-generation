Q. A flawless round of golf until missing that tiddler on the last, what was that, a lapse in concentration?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yes I was too busy watching the big screen over there watching the rugby and I just completely went blank.
Q. Yesterday you had nothing positive to say, today you went out and played like that - how?
DARREN CLARKE:  I have no idea really. I was on the range this morning and I turned to an old drill and I have been working hard with Pete and Ewen Murray came over and gave me a couple of suggestions as well and I just managed to get it on the clubface all day.
Q. Very well by the look of it?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yes I just can't explain it. I have played so badly now for a week or so and today I have gone out and played like that and shot a pretty decent score.
Q. The cream is rising to the top, is that testament to the severity of the test?
DARREN CLARKE:  I think so. The course is in great shape but it is just very tough with the conditions we have had for the first three days it is a big challenge as you can see from the scoring, there is nobody really running away with it. It is shaping up for a good day tomorrow.
Q. You came with no expectations, what now?
DARREN CLARKE:  I am going to go out and play and hopefully get it in the clubface like I did today and not miss too many of those like I did on the last.
Q. What would it mean to you to win the Irish Open?
DARREN CLARKE:  It would be great, this has been a tournament I have wanted to win for a long time but we are still a long way from that, hopefully I can answer that question tomorrow.
Q. Good crowd following you again today, does that help?
DARREN CLARKE:  Most definitely, there were a lot of people out there watching myself and Padraig in the game in front so there was a lot of golf for the Irish people to watch.
