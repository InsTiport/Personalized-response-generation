   DARREN CLARKE: Difficult day but that's what happens when you get fog delays. I think I got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning when I came back out I had a bad finish, but came back today and shot 2-under.   
  
  Q. You have the drive the ball well round here and that suits you?  
 DARREN CLARKE: Driving the ball well and hitting knock down iron shots. All in all I am very pleased with the way I am playing.  
  
  Q. The Ryder Cup gets exciting for you?  
 DARREN CLARKE: It is very special to me. I have had good times when I have been in it before. I have a lot to do now over the weekend. I need to have a really good weekend to get in there.   
 Bit disappointing finish this morning but nice to go out there and shoot 2-under. I gave myself a lot of chances.   
  
  Q. Can't be a coincidence; you did well here in 2004.  
 DARREN CLARKE: I like the course. It is a proper test. You have to drive the ball well, hit a lot of knock down shots and keep the ball flight under control and that's probably why I like it.
