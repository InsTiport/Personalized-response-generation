 Q.  Tell us about a good day? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  I played pretty nicely. I struggled on the greens because they are so grainy that I am struggling to pick my lines but I hung in there and chipped in at last which was a nice way to finish. It was a great reception and it is always nice to chip in but especially on the last green. 

 Q. You don't sound too well? 
 DARREN CLARKE: No I haven't eaten for almost three days now and I have poorly for a couple of days, throwing up and other things as well. I am just feeling very poorly and the physio guys are giving me lots of things to help me keep going so I am doing not too bad. 

 Q.  Can we just put it down to Delhi Belly? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  Yes something like that. But I'll keep going. 

 Q.  Is this type of course one you favour? 
 DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know about that. It is very tight and it is a tough test and you can see that from how bunched the leaderboard is. It is a great venue I think just very, very tough. The last was a huge bonus for me there and I can hopefully get a better night's sleep tonight, feel a bit better tomorrow and get up that leaderboard at the weekend.
