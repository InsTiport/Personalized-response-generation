Q.  Talk about what happened on the 18th.
DARREN CLARKE:  Just moved out of my second shot and tried to play a little pitch and run on my third try and chunked it, basically, and left myself a very tough putt.
Q.  Talk about 9, you acted with incredible integrity?
DARREN CLARKE:  That's part and parcel of the game.  I had a lie    when I went back out this morning, a lot of people had been looking for the ball and a lot of people had flattened the grass around it.  It was a much better lie than what I left it yesterday.  I come back to it and could have put it on to the front of the green if I had done, so just decided best thing to do, chip it out like I would have last night.
Q.  You may not have won the Irish Open but you've won a lot of people's hearts; well done.
DARREN CLARKE:  Obviously very disappointing.  I really wanted to win and disappointed to finish bogey, par, bogey.
Q.  I know your feelings about 18th will be different from what you did before this; you were so patient.
DARREN CLARKE:  I kept giving myself chances this morning and didn't make any putts, but just made a mistake.
Q.  16 and 18 were bogeys; 18 you were in good position.
DARREN CLARKE:  I was in good position to get it up there and just moved out of a 3 wood and made a mistake and tried to hit a sand wedge and chase it up there on the green and just caught it heavy.
Q.  The day started with a bizarre scenario with your ball in a much better position than it was yesterday.
DARREN CLARKE:  When I got back out this morning and the ball was there, not much grass around it.  And I had the opportunity to hit it on to the green, but I felt my conscience wouldn't allow me to do that.  So I decided to chip it out like I would have yesterday.
Q.  You must be feeling very, very disappointed.
DARREN CLARKE:  To say the least, yeah.
