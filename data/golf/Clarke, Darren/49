Q.   Guess it's the old clichÃ© but it's moving day and you really moved up the leaderboard. 
    DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, I've played really well all week.   I hit the ball really, really well yesterday, too, and then made a mess of the last hole.   Made no putts and made a mess of the last hole, the ninth yesterday. 
    Today I wanted to go out, play well and keep doing what I've been doing.   Hit an awful lot of good shots today and holed a couple of putts.

Q.   Conditions good for scoring? 
    DARREN CLARKE:   Very little breeze this morning so makes it a little bit easier but saying that, the pins were toughest today that they have been all week.   There were some real hard ones there today.   Obviously 64, I'm pleased.

Q.   What do you think the winning score needs to be?
    DARREN CLARKE:   I don't know.   I don't know and I'm not concerned because hopefully the guys won't get too far ahead and I'll put myself in there with a chance for tomorrow. 

Q.   You confident for tomorrow now?
    DARREN CLARKE:   No, I'll just go and play, try and play the same way as I played today I hope and see what the outcome is.

Q.   One of your better rounds in a recent while?
    DARREN CLARKE:   I shot two 64s ‑‑ I played in the Pro‑Am in Turkey two weeks ago, the Banco Classic, and it's a three‑round tournament, and I shot two 64s down there on the first day and last day.   So I'm playing okay.   I'm playing better again which is nice.

Q.   There's a suggestion that there needs to be a shorter format of golf to get more people participating, especially youngsters; do you think that's a valid call?
    DARREN CLARKE:   I don't know, I've heard talk about that for quite some time.   We do need to figure out some way within the game of getting more kids involved.   There seem to be a lot of people getting turned off by the game by the length of time it's taking to play. 
    You could I suppose blame it on us the professionals but at the end of the day it's our job and we have to be meticulous on what we do and some people take longer than others unfortunately.
    I can understand where the concerns are coming from.   I think trying to get a method is going to be quite difficult.

Q.   That's the way sport is going, though, at the moment, Rugby Sevens; Twenty20 cricket. 
    DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, more exciting and stuff and what‑have‑you, but it will be a very clever person that comes up with the format.   But if they do, great. 

Q.   Talk about the eagle on 16. 
    DARREN CLARKE:   I hit driver off the tee and just missed the green right down around into a very, very tricky lie in the rough and I hit a beautiful little pitch and lobbed it up there and trickled into the hole. 
    I had another chance for eagle on last but left it short but through a bit of a misread more than anything else.

Q.   I think you've been working long hours on the range this week.   Is it reaping the rewards of the hard work?
    DARREN CLARKE:   Well, I always work.   But because I've ‑‑ 

Q.   Always end of the year? 
    DARREN CLARKE:   No, well, I'm here to play.   I'm not here to make up the numbers.   You know, especially this past year where my game has been okay but not great.
    My timing has been off a little bit because of all the weight that I've lost.   So because of that, it's taken a bit of time and it's starting to come back now.
