   DARREN CLARKE: Two really good, strong teams and I'm sure it's going to be very close. On paper Europe would definitely be a stronger team than we are, but I'm sure it's going to be a very interesting week. 

 Q. You played in a few of these when Seve was still with us. How were those experiences? 
 DARREN CLARKE: I think they are all very good. I think it's a great thing for the young guys and the rookies and what have you. Not that we don't enjoy it as the older guys, but it's much more relaxed obviously than The Ryder Cup is and stuff. 
 But it's a fantastic way for the prospective Ryder Cup players to get on to the team.

 Q. A great steppingstone for the likes of Simon Dyson. 
 DARREN CLARKE: Exactly. Great steppingstone for those guys. 

 Q. Is it good that you can have a chance then still to honour the memory of Seve?
 DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's the best way. We're all here.
