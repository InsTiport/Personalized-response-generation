DARREN CLARKE:   I played nicely again today.  Just hit a bad swing off the 18th tee and pulled it into the bunker.  I had a lot of really good putts again all the way around the back side.  Again had a chance there and none of them went in.  I played nicely again.
Q.  Assess your week?
DARREN CLARKE:   I finished poorly.  If you take a look at the way I played 17, 18, I wasted chances.
Q.  Do you know Scott?
DARREN CLARKE:   Not at all.  Not at all.  He's got a one shot lead there on the last.  I don't know him at all.  Very impressive.
Q.  Do you think he's at that stage that he doesn't realize the enormity of the tournament?
DARREN CLARKE:   I have no idea.  I don't know the guy.  He's obviously playing very well.
Q.  What's your schedule heading into Shinnecock?
DARREN CLARKE:   I'm playing Buick.  This week off, then playing Buick the week after.
