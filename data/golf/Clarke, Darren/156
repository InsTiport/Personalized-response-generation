DARREN CLARKE:  I just didn't lay the clubface on it at any stage all day. I hit the ball terrible. I managed to get it round. That is about as good as I can put on it.
Q.  24 putts the key?
DARREN CLARKE:  Well,  I kept missing greens so if you keep missing greens you are going to get the putts down. Well you should do.
Q.  Proud of the way you came back with four birdies in the last seven?
DARREN CLARKE:  I did well.
Q.  It finished okay?
DARREN CLARKE:  The score is a much better reflection than the way I hit the ball. I played terrible today and didn't lay the clubface on it at any stage. Just grinded out there, made a lot of mistakes but couple of good breaks at the end and managed to hole a few putts.
Q.  Important when players are pulling ahead?
DARREN CLARKE:  Paul played very nicely and made some nice putts. He played really solid all day and if I was going to give myself any chance I knew I had to get something going. It wasn't through the ball striking.
Q.  Practice or Cup Final?
DARREN CLARKE:  Definitely Cup Final first. Maybe practice afterwards.
Q.  Tomorrow?
DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know. I played so badly today I just don't know.
