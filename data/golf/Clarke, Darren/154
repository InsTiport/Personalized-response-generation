Q. Better than yesterday?
DARREN CLAKRE:  Not particularly, no. I am deriving no pleasure whatsoever from playing golf at the moment. It is horrific.
Q. So when you get off to a start like that, does it not perk you up a bit?
DARREN CLAKRE:  No, it was a lucky start, there wasn't too many good shots involved with it.
Q. So that is two weeks in a row you are saying that you cannot lay a club on the ball?
DARREN CLAKRE:  Yes I can't be bothered with it any more, I'm fed up with it.
Q. So where do you take it from here then?
DARREN CLAKRE:  I don't know, I'm not interested. I can't be bothered.
Q. Is it the rugby tomorrow then Darren?
DARREN CLAKRE:  Yes, it is. I've got more interest in trying to watch that, but it is a two-tee U-draw, so I don't know if I'll be finished in time for it or not. Hopefully I'll be finished in time so I can watch the rugby.
