DARREN CLARKE:  I dropped my ball, I was an inch from the ball on the 13th green, and it hit my coin, flipped it over, and the referee came along and told me to put it back.  Subsequently, a one shot penalty.
Q.  What happened?
DARREN CLARKE:  I was putting the ball back down on the 13th green.  I'm just about here and the ball as flown this far from the marker, the marker has flipped over, called the referee told him I put it back, under no penalty because I was in the process of replacing the ball and JP (John Paramor) has pulled me and said it's not; it's a one shot penalty.
Q.  So the ball slipped out of your hand when you marked it?
DARREN CLARKE:  Put it back down, yeah.
Q.  Did it hit the marker?
DARREN CLARKE:  It hit the mark on the marker.
