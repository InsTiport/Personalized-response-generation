   DARREN CLARKE: I played nicely for the most part today. Played sensibly to the middle of the greens much of the time and attacked a bit with wedges in my hand.   
  
  Q. Nice memories from 2004 when you led after round one and hold the course record?  
 DARREN CLARKE: Yes. The course is fantastic and it is always nice to come back to one where you have played well on before. That's the same for everybody. It's a lot different to then though as it is softer and the greens are holding and it wasn't quite that way last time we were here.  
  
  Q. Any highlights?   
 DARREN CLARKE: Not really. I just played nicely all day. I have just done the right thing, struck it well and didn't get myself into world of pain off the tee. It was alright. The only hole I played badly was that last one there in the dark, the 14th, and I have a 30 footer for par in the morning. That's a big ask to hole that but overall pretty good.
