DARREN CLARKE:  Hit it terrible and not playing very good.  I just can't get a strike on it and I can't control my ball flight at all.  And I'm working my way on trying to sort it out and I can't get out of it.
Q.  Good to see Paul up there?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, it's good.  He's been playing good for a while and I think he's had a good score coming.
Q.  You had a 5:00 start this morning.  You look a bit tired.
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm fine.  No excuses.
