Q.  Overall, your reflections?
DARREN CLARKE:  Obviously to get in good position, you know feeling a lot better, after the third tee shot.
Q.  First competitive round here; did it stack up as you expected?
DARREN CLARKE:  I think it probably played a little bit easier today.  You can see that from the scores.  It was easier today than it did yesterday in the Pro Am.  Certainly it was tough out there, a lot of tough shots out there.
Q.  What was the key?
DARREN CLARKE:  Trying to hit driver off the tee, trying to pick your line and hoping the wind is going to move enough to take certain bunkers out of play and it's tough to get it on the fairway.
Q.  Every aspect it tested?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, the wind is whipping hard across there now.  We were fortunate this morning in that we haven't got the worst of the weather.

I believe the wind has pushed back up a little bit.  The greens were a little bit softer but maybe they are going to firm up and be more difficult this afternoon.
Q.  What about the pressure of playing in front of the home fans?
DARREN CLARKE:  It was good obviously to get off to a about start and put in a really good score the first round.  I did have a very early tee time, but did manage to make a nice birdie on No. 8 and got it back to 2 under.  Come back tomorrow and hopefully get off to a decent start and get myself right up there and give them something to cheer about.
