Q. Pretty raw right now.  You've been on both sides of this equation.  Are they too raw to offer any perspective about the entire week?
DARREN CLARKE: No, not at all.  At the end of the day, the American guys played better that we did.  They holed the putts when they had, and we lipped out.  But that's happened the other way around for quite some time.
The guys gave it all.  They are trying everything, they tried as hard as they could.  You can't ask for anything more as a captain.  We're obviously bitterly disappointed, but credit to Davis and his team for the performance of the day.
Q. I saw you gather a number of your guys just a moment ago, including Lee Westwood.  What do you say at a moment like that to your team?
DARREN CLARKE: There's things that I say, but it would be very prude of me to say what I said to my team at a moment like that.
