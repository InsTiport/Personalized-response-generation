DARREN CLARKE:  I hit it really nicely today and gave myself an awful lot of chances. I missed the 11th green and the last there - a lapse in concentration - but I had a lot of putts from the 10 to 12 feet range for birdies and unfortunately missed a few but overall, six under is pretty good.

I have been working on a few things with Ewen Murray and trying to hit it as hard as I can and if the club is in the right then I can do that, and I am feeling quite comfortable with what I am doing.

I played nice, really nice and hit it well. There were an awful lot of them. I've been in contention here a few times before and it's good to be up there again for the weekend.
