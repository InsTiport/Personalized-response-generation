Q.  The 18th again?
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, bad 6.
Q.  Talk us through that hole, if you would.
DARREN CLARKE:   I pulled it.  It was a poor shot.  I pulled it and bounced over the bunker ran up against the out of bounds fence and I had to take a penalty drop.
Q.  Obviously a disappointing finish, particularly after birdieing the 17th.
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, it was.
Q.  Thoughts for tomorrow?
DARREN CLARKE:   Well, beating my head against a brick wall at the moment.
