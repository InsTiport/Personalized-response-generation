DARREN CLARKE:  Hit the ball terribly.  Missing it all over the place.  Played very poorly.  
 

Q.  What is the difference? 
 
DARREN CLARKE:   Why do you keep asking me these questions you know the answer to?  
 

Q.  What is the answer? 
 
DARREN CLARKE:   I don't know what the answer.  I did a lot of good work at the start of the week.  Felt everything was pretty good  -- but going into playing the tournament and it doesn't work out that way at all.  
 

Q.  Indication is you played a lot better yesterday than today?
 
DARREN CLARKE:   I played better, yeah.  Today I was trying to hit a lot of knock-down, punch shots, which is what I go back on whenever things are not going quite so well, and even those ones were not good.  So it's not going in the direction that I want to go. 
 

Q.  Do you get any satisfaction, getting a 70, feeling the way you are and the way you played?
 
DARREN CLARKE:   No.  I hit it that bad.  I can't get any satisfaction out of it whatsoever.  I was pleased that I finished birdie, birdie to give myself a very flattering score.
