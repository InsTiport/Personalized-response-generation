Q.  Well done, guys.  Spectacular victory.  Darren just getting the embrace.  I suppose it had to be you, didn't it, Darren?

DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know, it's worked out that way the past couple days, me finishing it off, but Lee played great today.  If it hadn't been for him, we would have been a lot more under them.
Q.  Did you fancy that one when you stood behind it?

DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know, he teed it up for me, but I was lucky with the lie.
Q.  You're making Ian Woosnam look rather good at the moment as his two captain's picks?

DARREN CLARKE:  People said we were a gamble, and I think the people who were mostly sure it wasn't a gamble were the two of us.  We know each other's games so well and we enjoy each other's company so much and we enjoy playing with each other.

LEE WESTWOOD:  He's one for the drama, though, isn't he?  It's like a big stage.
