 Q. Clearly not the day you were hoping for. What was the problem today?
 DARREN CLARKE: From tee-to-green I was fine. I just struggled on the greens again today and missed a couple short ones early and then struggled for my pace after that. Trying to get 20-footers stone dead is pretty tough, and just made a few mistakes on the greens, that was all.

 Q. Any consolation birdieing two of the last three?
 DARREN CLARKE: Always better to shoot under par than over par. I was grinding my way out there and two birdies on 16 and 18 and managed to get a couple putts to go in the hole, so that was all right.

 Q. More frustrating because other people managed to make birdies?
 DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, there are some other people making some putts and what-have-you, and you can only put as good a stroke on it as you can. And a lot of the times I felt as if I hit really good putts and I 3-putted from two foot on No. 2, and I didn't believe I hit a bad putt at first. 
 That's just the same for everybody. There's a few guys obviously with the scoring, the breeze is down, so if you do get it on a run, you can knock some in. 

 Q. Do you think two wins in the last four months is enough for Mr. Faldo?
 DARREN CLARKE: My other ones were to try to get back up the World Rankings, so that's important for me. I need to go out and have a good day tomorrow to get as many World Ranking points as I can and try to get back in that Top-50 again. From my perspective I'll go out and play well, in terms of The Ryder Cup, I've played as well as I can play this week, and we'll see what happens.
