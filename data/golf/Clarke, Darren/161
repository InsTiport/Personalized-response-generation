DARREN CLARKE: Played shite. I'm putting very solid.  I'm hitting it very poorly, I'm trying to minimize my mistakes and I knocked in a couple of really good putts when I needed to. I'm eight under par but that is not through ball striking.
Q.  Went a bit left a couple of times?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, just everything was heavy left.  Everything. It is not as if I am not putting in the time on the range. I am working hard down there. I can't get where I need to get.
Q.  You mentioned Tiger gave you a little tip in the scorer's tent yesterday.
DARREN CLARKE:  That didn't work either. I'm stuffed.
Q.What now?
Q. Either the range or the bar. I haven't decided which yet.
