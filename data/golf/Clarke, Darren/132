  Q. Three over after eight but turned it around well?   
 DARREN CLARKE: Yes, I did. I just hit some poor shots and short sided myself. The rough is difficult and you can't afford to do that. I hit a lot of good shots after that. I had a few chances and made four good birdies with a few more chances and it was disappointing to bogey the last. However anything around level par is okay. The course is much more difficult than any year I've been here. The rough is thicker than the year I won it but the course is magnificent as usual. All in all, even par isn't a bad start.
