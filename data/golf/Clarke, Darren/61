 Q. Your thoughts on the first round?  
DARREN CLARKE:   I don't think you could really‑‑ I don't think you could publish my thoughts right now.   But I had a lovely tee shot to the first and made a pure putt.   From there, it just got worse.   I played poorly and I putted worse.   It was disappointing, because at practice I hit it really, really well.   But what can I do, I tried my best on every shot, but unfortunately it wasn't there again today.  
   
 Q.   Are you even more disappointed that the scoring conditions were what they were today?   
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, just everything.   The Open Championship is the biggest and best tournament in the world.   The course is so benign, if you hit good shots out there you're going to get rewarded.   I wasn't able to make any putts at all to save anything, to save any momentum or gain any momentum.   That's it, bad day at the office.  
   
 Q.   A long way back, and you have a lot of work to do for the weekend.   
DARREN CLARKE:   It is a long drive back home, isn't it?   I've got to go and practise.   I've got to work.   I'm basically disgusted with myself for shooting 6‑over.   That's not what I was after.  
   
 Q.   When you walked to the first tee and stood on the first tee as champion, did you feel like it was going to be a good day?  
DARREN CLARKE:   I've hit it well in practice and hit it well on the range, and I went there and I couldn't do it.   I started hitting it in the bunkers.   Even though my strike was good, I was starting too many shots right of my target, and I couldn't quite figure out a way to get it back on line again.   Couple that with not holing any putts at all, I think of two single putts, one from a foot and one from three foot.   That was about it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   You can't really do that at Lytham, unfortunately.   You've got to manoeuvre your way around.   Off the tee I wasn't too bad, but from there on I wasn't very good.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, the crowd was great.   They kept shouting for me and showing me support.   Unfortunately I couldn't reciprocate.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, and then I hit a really good second shot trying to chase a 3‑wood.   Just caught the corner of that bunker.   As the ball is sitting down, I'm trying to splash it, hit it really hard, and I sort of half‑shanked it into the other bunker.   It was one of those lies that I had to do something, but such is golf.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   No, no, no that's links golf.   I just tried to stay patient, and I did.   I didn't get overly frustrated all day.   I tried my best and everything, and it didn't happen.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, yeah, that's‑‑  
   
 Q.   The birdies are there?  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, the birdies are there.   That's links golf.   That's what it is.   But I've certainly got to hit my scoring clubs an awful lot better than I did today.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   No, I just‑‑ yeah, I did have chances all the way.   Even my putts for saves were from not that far away.   I could not marry the line and pace at all.   Couldn't get it today.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   No, the greens were perfect.   There was nothing wrong with the greens.   It was just me.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah.   Probably coming up the last thinking how the bleep did I manage to win this last year?
