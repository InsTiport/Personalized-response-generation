  Q.  Talk about your round?   

 DARREN CLARKE:  Strangely enough, I didn't play as bad yesterday.  Almost had a chance to make the cut today.   

 I played really solid today.  Yesterday was a really big disappointment.   

 I played nice today.  I plan to go back to the beach in the Bahamas (Abaco).  The course is great.
