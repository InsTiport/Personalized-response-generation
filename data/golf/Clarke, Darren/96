   DARREN CLARKE: It just wasn't there. I had a 30-footer for par there on 14 last night. That was always going to be a tough one to hole. 
 Then 15 missed the fairway and that is one of the longest holes on the course. Hit a good third shot to six feet and missed it. Perfect tee shot on 16 but totally misjudged my pitch. Hit it a bit heavy as I tried to run it up there. Just short of the green. Chipped up to four feet and missed it. Then on 17, hit a four iron and tried to hold it up and just pulled it a bit. I was in a deep heel mark in the bunker. It was one of those that was supposed to be raked and someone had walked through it and it wasn't. Just one of those mistakes. I couldn't get it anywhere and lucky to move it five yards. Then on to the green, two putts, double. Then rallied at the end for a par.

 Q. Are you eager to find out whose footprint it was?
 DARREN CLARKE: No just a mistake. There are so many out here they are going to miss one now and again and just unfortunate I was the guy in it. That's the way it goes sometimes.

 Q. You got it going yesterday so that's positive?
 DARREN CLARKE: I am playing well. I just had a bad morning, that goes without saying. Disappointed with that as going out this morning I was hoping for better but that is the way it is. That's this golf course, if you make any poor shots you pay the penalty and that's what I did.

 Q. Any good vibes from 2004?
 DARREN CLARKE: The course is fantastic. I don't think any players will complain about the course whatsover. The course is a fantastic test of golf.
