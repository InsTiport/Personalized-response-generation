   DARREN CLARKE: I played really well from tee-to-green and I couldn't quite get the ball to the hole. The greens were a little bit slower today than they have been the first few days, I don't know why, but I just didn't quite have the pace on the greens.

 Q. What did you think of the course generally?
 DARREN CLARKE: I think the course is great. I think it's going to be a fantastic Ryder Cup venue. The way they have done it, there's so much room for movement off tees that they can make it much more a risk and reward golf course, which is what the Ryder Cup is all about.

 Q. And your experience in that, how does this compare? 
 DARREN CLARKE: It will be good. It's always difficult to judge a course when it's new and this is obviously new. A few years of the course maturing and getting better, I think it will be a great venue for The Ryder Cup.

 Q. And do you like this tournament?
 DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, I haven't been here for a few years, but it's great to come back again and especially good to have a look at the golf course.

 Q. Still in the mix. 
 DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, I've got to go low tomorrow, but it's possible. 
 I'm playing okay, so we shall see. 

 Q. Keep your fingers crossed, big name missing, Woosnam, you're obviously missing him. 
 DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, I keep in touch with him, he texts me a little bit now and again and we speak to each other. He's venturing into new grounds at the moment and it's great to see him back fit again and healthy again and playing and he's going to start racking up the wins sooner rather than later, I'm sure.
