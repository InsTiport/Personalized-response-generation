RODDY WILLIAMS:  What are your thoughts on coming back here to Britain?
DARREN CLARKE:  Certainly big Ryder Cup memories.  Yeah, well, it's obviously good to come back.  The only real reason I'm here playing this week is because Chubby is running the tournament.  Otherwise I certainly wouldn't be here.  But it was nice it get back to the U.K. again, only a couple of hours away from home.  I'm sure it will be a good week.
Q.  Have you looked at the Ryder Cup standings?
DARREN CLARKE:  I haven't, no.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  I played Wentworth last Friday.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  A, I don't think there's much chance of me making the cut; and B, I will definitely be at the Cup final.
Q.  How are you getting there?
DARREN CLARKE:  Whatever way I need to.
Q.  You have tickets?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yeah, I'm a season ticket holder.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  Not necessarily, no.  I could commute just as easily from London as I can from here, so I will do whatever I need to do.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  I could sort of say that, yes.  I feel it always has been.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  No, Chubby and I did discuss that whenever we were coming from parts of Ireland unfortunately, but the tournament's got a bigger and better sponsor now and some events have to move.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  No, I don't, do I, Chub?  No.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know, why, I don't know.  No, not really.  I don't know, probably winning the European Open at The K Club.
Q.  Predictions for who will win?
DARREN CLARKE:  I would love to say that Liverpool would win 2 nil.  That's what I would love to say.  Surprises have always happened there.  I would love to say it was going to be 2 nil.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  I don't know, I've always been a fan of Liverpool since I was a kid, always have been.  Just from when I was probably seven years old, I was a Liverpool fan.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  Not an awful lot, no.  It could well be, yes.
Q.  Inaudible?
DARREN CLARKE:  Unfortunately not an awful lot.  I don't get the chance to go but when I can, we do.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Darren, thanks very much.
