   DARREN CLARKE: I'm just going away. I need a rest. I'm tired. I won't up the clubs for ten days. I won't even look at them for ten days. So I'm just mentally tired. I need to have a rest.   
  
  Q. It's been a whirlwind for you since the British Open?  
 DARREN CLARKE: It has been busy, good busy, but I'm ready for a rest.
