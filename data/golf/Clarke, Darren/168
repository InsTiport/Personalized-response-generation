DARREN CLARKE: I was pleased with that. I've struggled with my game for most of the week and haven't hit the ball all that well, but we went on to the range last night for a couple of hours and figured a couple of things out and I drove the ball really, really well today. I was swinging the club properly and everything was pretty good.

I wouldn't imagine it's enough. Good finish for going into next week and I'm pleased with the way I played today. I'm doing okay, grinding it out when I have to and kept on going and some days you wait for a day like today when it gets better. Hopefully I can get the grinding days down a bit and have more days like today.

My putting was the problem the first couple of rounds, but everything was good today. I drove it as well as I have for some time and long as well. You have to be long and straight next week and keep it out of the bunkers. Next week -- the Open at St. Andrews -- it doesn't get any better. That would be the ultimate one.

Last week I wasn't in the slightest bit bothered if I had gone missed cut, missed cut.
