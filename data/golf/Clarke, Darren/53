  DARREN CLARKE:   68 was probably the worst score I could have shot today.  
   
 Q.   Is it small things that can make a big difference?   
DARREN CLARKE:   Just knocking the odd putt in somewhere to make a birdie or save par or whatever, that's what I haven't been doing for a couple of years.   Today I did that on a couple of occasions and certainly putt a little bit of a spring in myself and I feel as if I can hole some putts, I know I can compete.   
   
 Q.   You're well in contention in this tournament.   
DARREN CLARKE:   Well, not quite in contention, there's a lot of guys there.   But I've been very pleased with the way I've been hitting the ball for quite some time.   My scoring hasn't been ridiculously poor.   But in saying that, just carrying on this weekend and keep hitting the way I can, hopefully kick on from here, have a good weekend and carry on to the Greenbrier in a couple weeks.  
There's a low score in me somewhere if I can hole enough putts and give myself chances and that's been the way for quite some time.   It would be very nice if one of those low scores were to appear this week.  
   
 Q.   Big crowds here, big Irish support, must give you a big lift, as always, at this tournament?  
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, the crowds have come out again and we've had some wonderful weather and it's nice to play at home.   The crowds are loud and they love the players from home, and they show that everywhere we go around the course.
