Q.   Good today? 
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, I played really nicely.   Hit it pinâ€‘high all day long.   I had chances from everywhere.   Missed everything on front nine and holed a couple, not much, holed a couple of ten, 15 footers on the back nine so all in all very good. 

Q.   Signs of the rust coming off. 
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, definitely.   Getting used to my stroke.   Overall, pretty good.   I had a huge horseshoe there on the last.   All in all, very good today.   Hardly missed a shot.   Thought it was going to take a bit of time but it was good.

Q.   Have you noticed how fit you feel?
DARREN CLARKE:   I'm certainly not as bad as what I would have been a month ago, put it that way.

Q.   And how did you enjoy the Amateur format? 
DARREN CLARKE:   It was very good.   Well, we won it last year, and Jason was good fun today.   We had a real good time with him.   It was all good. 

Q.   A welcome addition to the tournament?
DARREN CLARKE:   I had no problems with it last year and certainly he was a great partner again today.
