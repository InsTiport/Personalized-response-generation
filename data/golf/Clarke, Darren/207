DARREN CLARKE:  It was pretty good early on and then let a few slip toward the end. Wasted a few. Hit two really good shots onto the 17th and then three putted it and then didn't birdie the last. Disappointed to let a few go.

It's been okay but I feel I have left a few out there today. Two good shots onto 17th and then hit it in the rough on the 18th. Hopefully I won't finish too far behind at the end of the day.
Q.  Did you have a figure in mind?
DARREN CLARKE:  No, just went out to play and see how I got on.
Q.  Ernie the man to watch?
DARREN CLARKE:  Yes. He will probably go out and shoot a few more. He will be tough to catch but hopefully won't be too far ahead. The game is fine.
