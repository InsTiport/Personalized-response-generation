Q.  How were you playing tee-to-green?
DARREN CLARKE:   Tee-to-green everything was really good, really good. In match-play you've got to get it up-and-down.  I did it two years ago, but I didn't do this time.  Tee-to-green, I played exactly the way I want. 

Q.  Were the greens too difficult?
DARREN CLARKE:   You can't really blame the greens if I'm missing my putts.  I had a good tee shot on 15  -- after I got two back, I had a 9-iron to 30 feet behind the hole and missed it left.  Then I holed it from 18 feet; that was a huge putt. 

Q.  What was the difference in the match?
DARREN CLARKE:   He putted nicely and I didn't.  Just didn't make anything.
