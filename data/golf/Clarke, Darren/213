DARREN CLARKE:  Unfortunately, I had a bad hole but got away with it, but I hit quite a few good shots as well.
Q.  Was the 18th
DARREN CLARKE:   It just got very steep.  I had to drive my wrist into the ground.  It was down where the ball was.  I just got steep on it and hit it heavy.  That was one I got away with it.  There was a couple of other ones which didn't go where I wanted to go, but I grinded out and hit some good shots to make up for it.
Q.  Been resting since Dubai?
DARREN CLARKE:   I got here     got home from Dubai     if I had gotten a flight that night I would not have been able to watch the rugby.  So I actually stayed in Dubai and then got a flight home.  So I stayed in Dubai and watched the rubgy.  It was just fantastic.  I flew home on Sunday and flew here Wednesday.  From here, we rented a house in Isleworth for a month.  Stuck around last week, doing Disney and things like that.
Q.  Are you looking forward to staying in one place for a while?
DARREN CLARKE:   It will be nice, yes.  I have a very hectic schedule.  It's nice to be over here and be in one place.
Q.  The first couple of times you played    does it fit your eye?
DARREN CLARKE:   Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  Last year     it's just getting used golf course.  It's easy to keep going back to the same ones in Europe because you get to know them well.  This one I didn't really see myself getting around.
Q.  So this must be your best round?
DARREN CLARKE:   Yeah, I think it is.
Q.  Is it nice to know that you can shoot 66 on a course that you don't particularly like?
DARREN CLARKE:   I didn't say I didn't particularly like it.  I was able to grind it out again.  I did that.  And I think as I told you at The Match Play, I was grinding and was able to do that again today.  That's another part of my game that I've been trying to work hard on.  I keep on doing it.  I've always tried to hit good shots all the time.  Sometimes it just doesn't happen.
Q.  So patience, as well?
DARREN CLARKE:   Yes, just keep going and see what happens.
Q.  What will you do this afternoon?  Will you see Butch?
DARREN CLARKE:   I'll go to Isleworth and hit balls.  I'll speak to him and go over there and go over there.  Just keep working on the same things.
