 Q.  How important was it for Sergio and Rafa to come back the way they did?  
DARREN CLARKE: Yeah, massive, huge.  To have that heart and to have that belief and to have that team thing.  I mean, the two guys are just so pumped up for it.  They worked hard.   
Every other pairing are trying to do the same thing.  Every team member is trying to do the same thing.  Certainly from their point of view, just to push it that further for the team is fantastic.   
 Q.  Thoughts on your pairings for the afternoon?  
DARREN CLARKE: Strong.  You look down the list at the guys that are down there, they are obviously very experienced players, the majority of them.  They are right there and they want to play.  A lot of them, it's four matches in a row, but they are ready to go.   
 Q.  Five of your guys play five matches and you've done that yourself; is it a calculated risk?  
DARREN CLARKE: It's something that I spoke to all of them about before and they were all comfortable to do so if asked to do so, and that's what they have done.
