  Q.  Still the only European to have won the WGC - Accenture Match Play?   
 DARREN CLARKE:  I played well that particular week and now I am just looking forward to playing Sergio. I am looking forward to it. Will be very good.   
  
  Q.  Some good matches all the way down?   
 DARREN CLARKE:  That's what happens with the top 64 players in the world. This is a very different course to La Costa and there are lots of birdie opportunities out there so there will be a lot of upsets. Should be an interesting week.   
  
  Q.  Having won at La Costa, are you happy to see it move?   
 DARREN CLARKE:  I would rather it was still at La Costa.   
  
  Q.  When was the last time you played against Sergio in Match Play?   
 Absolutely no idea. Maybe in a practice round in the Ryder Cup but really have no idea. Just want to go and play and enjoy it.
