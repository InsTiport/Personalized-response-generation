  Q. The week has got better score wise, do you feel that in your game too?  
 DARREN CLARKE: Yes I do, there is a lot of encouragement in there for me. I didn't play my absolute best out there, even today but I did not bad. I left some shots out there but I have had two weeks off where I didn't do much apart from lie on a beach. Sometimes you need that just to recharge the batteries but it means when you do come back that you find time to get your eye in and your scoring eye in if you know what I mean. So this hasn't been bad.   
  
  Q. You have been working hard on your game, looking ahead to next week?  
 DARREN CLARKE: I have and although it is not quite where I want it to be, I am really looking forward to going to Hazeltine. The guys at the PGA of America have been very kind in giving me an invite to play in the tournament and the fact I have a little bit of form going to it means I am very much looking forward to it.
