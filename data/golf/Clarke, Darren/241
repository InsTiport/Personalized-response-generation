DARREN CLARKE:   My position going into Sunday is very flattering, considering the way I've hit the ball.  I am 8-under when I feel I should be  8-over.  If I knew why, then I wouldn't have to struggle like this.  It's been the same old problem that's been costing me shots.  My short game has been great, I have to say.  I wish could bottle whatever it is I had this week.  Tomorrow, if the rain is heavy, it is going to play a lot longer, but we'll just to have to wait and see.  I've had a mixture of horrible shots with some really good  ones.  I don't know what's going to come next.  I just ground it out all day.  Some of my up-and-downs this week have been phenomenal.  Seve would have been proud of them.  I finished quite well with two  putts from 25 feet for a birdie at the 16th.  I hit an 8-iron to 12 feet for another one at the 17th.
