  DARREN CLARKE: I played well.  I had a five-footer to go 3-under for the round on 11 and missed it.  After a couple of bogeys, had a couple of pulls in the right-left in the wind, which is never good.  So I've got to do a little bit of work on that.  Drove the ball extremely well.  And had enough chances.  Had a lot of really good putts again.  But didn't quite make as many as I should have done.  I had a lot of chances but didn't quite convert them.  Level par is not bad.  Hoping for better, but level par is okay.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: You get good sides.  I've been at enough Open Championships where I've had the bad side of it as well.  They all even out.Q. What are you hoping for tomorrow?DARREN CLARKE: Just going out and playing and trying to not pull in this right-to-left wind, and go out tomorrow and hopefully shoot a good score.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: Yeah.  I played nicely again last week, and you know the ball-striking, as I said, is getting better and better again.  So my golf game is coming back slowly and surely.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: That's wonderful, you know.  He's had a tough Friday and you guys have obviously kept reminding him of his tough Fridays.  But it's great to see him doing what he's doing today.  He's a great kid.  He's a talented kid.  If he keeps playing as he is, he's going to be a tough man to catch.  He's proved that before.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: The oldest gentleman to make the cut.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: Brilliant.  I don't know where I'm going to be when I'm 64.  If I was going playing golf like the quality of golf that Tom Watson is playing, then I'd be very, very pleased.  He's just a gentleman on the golf course and he played quite beautifully.Q. Are you happy to play until you're 60?DARREN CLARKE: I don't know.  Could be in rehab at that stage, I don't know.  We shall see.Q. Is Rory the man to beat?DARREN CLARKE: Well, obviously with the score he's shooting at the moment, of course he's the man to beat this week.  When Rory gets in form he's pretty tough to beat.Q. (Inaudible.)DARREN CLARKE: Yes, he is.Q. Would you bet against him now?DARREN CLARKE: It's great to see him doing what he's doing.  He'll be a tough guy to catch.
