 Q. Nice to be home, Martin?
 MARTIN LAIRD: It's a shame, everybody keeps saying it's a shame for the players. We are fine in here. The people that spent all of the months and weeks getting ready for this and spectators, it's a shame for. We are kind of used to delays. It's not too bad for us. It's a shame for the area, such a big event and then have this happen. 

 Q. And it's real act-of-God stuff. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, there's nothing we can do about it, it's no one's fault. It's just one of those very unfortunate things.

 Q. 54 holes the right thing to do? 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, they were saying that if the weather forecast isn't much better tomorrow, that might even be tough to get in. I haven't been down to see the course but I understand it's not in very good shape right now with the rain which is understandable. 

 Q. I suppose with the next tournament coming up --
 MARTIN LAIRD: It's tough, this is such a big event. For me I obviously would like to play a full event, but you can understand with a major next week, that a lot of guys wouldn't be happy with the decision to go into Monday. 
 It's one of those things. It's horrible timing.
