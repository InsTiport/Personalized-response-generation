  MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, it was difficult out there today.   Starting on the front, you've got the first few holes that are easy and down off the right and holes 5 through 13 you're playing into wind off the left the whole way, and I don't know what it's blowing, 30 miles an hour, but trouble everywhere.   So I fought with all of those holes just to shoot 3‑over on those holes. 

Q.   You move the ball from left‑to‑right, as well, so does it make it even more difficult?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I really struggled on those holes.   I think I hit one green in that stretch.   My chipping was really good today.   Chipped well and holed a lot and made a lot of 10‑footers just to keep my score around where it was at.   Today was one of those days, you could see how guys are shooting 7‑, 8‑over par, no problem, it was very, very tough.

Q.   How excited are you about the chance to win a major with the way it's going?
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm obviously in a good position.   I don't know what the weather is going to be like this weekend but if it keeps up like this, the scores are going to be high.   But I'm right just in there at 1‑over.   If I keep chipping the way I did and hole some more putts, we'll see what happens.
