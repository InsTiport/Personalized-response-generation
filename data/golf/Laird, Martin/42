Q.   Martin, had a good round today, 2‑under to go with a 3‑under yesterday.   Your thoughts on how you played today? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   Didn't hit it the as good today, but I chipped and putted really well, putted really, really well, especially on the back nine, a lot of saves.   Tough golf course, so you're going to have to do that, so with some of the shots today I'm happy with that number.

Q.   When you made that putt, it was a nice sand save to get in the house with a par there?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I had just bogeyed 17 and I had been playing good all day and kind of saving myself all day, and I really didn't want to finish bogey‑bogey, so making that nice one on 18 definitely helps and will make lunch a little bit nicer.

Q.   Birdie 4, eagle at 5, so that kick‑started everything. 
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, great shot into 4, 5‑iron to about 10 feet, which was nice, because that's one of the harder holes every year, and then a nice little chip‑in from the front edge on 5 so, you know, 4 is one of the harder holes, and 5 is a good par 5, so it's a bonus to play those in 3‑under for sure.   So that got everything going, and then it was a case of holding on on the back nine.   Started struggling with my game tee‑to‑green, but I managed to hold on. 

Q.   How different were the course conditions this morning compared to what you had yesterday afternoon? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   It was totally different.   There was obviously no wind today, but the course was playing way longer.   It was cold this morning, the ground was wet, and I would say it was playing a club, maybe more than a club, longer in terms of the 7‑iron yesterday was a 6‑iron today, so the course was playing long, and this course isn't easy, even with no wind.   It wasn't like it was easy out there with no wind. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Martin.
