   On being in the field at THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time.
 MARTIN LAIRD: I'm obviously excited and ready to get started. It's one of those tournaments that I knew I would be in when I kept my card last year and it's a tournament you definitely circle on the calendar. It's one of those tournaments you always hear about so I was really excited to get here, now I'm just ready to get started. Any time you get to play in a field like this you have to be excited to test your game against the best players in the world on a very tough golf course.
 On watching this tournament over the years.
 MARTIN LAIRD: One thing you realize watching this tournament over the years is that it's never over. You always see guys who look like they're going to win and then they struggle down the stretch because it's such a tough finish. Pretty much from 14 on it's a really tough finish. It's definitely a golf course where you can't point to one hole and say that's an easy hole. It's a course where you have to be playing well every day, you can't get away with an average round. It's definitely an exciting tournament.
 On playing 17 for the first time.
 MARTIN LAIRD: I played it yesterday for the first time. It's obviously a great hole and I was happy to get that behind me. You're even a little anxious to hit your shot there in a practice round. Hopefully I can hit four nice shots there during the week and not give anyone anything to talk about.
 On his mindset standing on 17 tee for the first time in competition.
 MARTIN LAIRD: I can't speak from experience but I'm sure there will be a few nerves standing on that tee on Thursday.
