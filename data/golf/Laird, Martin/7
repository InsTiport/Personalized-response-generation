Q. Great two rounds of golf for you.  And being here there's probably an expectation for you to play well, but how difficult is it to have people expect you to play well and actually go out and do it?
MARTIN LAIRD: Oh, you know, I have my own expectations, I don't really feel like I have any more expectations this week to play well than others.  So I just like being at home this week, sleeping in my own bed and playing a course that -- I don't play this course very much in between the Waste Management tournaments, but I practice out here a lot.  So obviously feel comfortable out here, I spend a lot of time out here, so it's always nice to do well in a tournament here.
Q. You're definitely scoring a lot through the first two rounds, 12 birdies and an eagle in there, some bogeys certainly mixed in there.  But that comes with the risk/reward, right.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, it's that type of golf course.  There's a ton of birdie holes, but there's also a good number of holes out here that a shot that's not that far off can get you.  You got to manage this course pretty well and I feel like I've done that well the first two days and just continue to do it.
Q. Sounds obvious and like a dumb question about birdieing the final hole, but talk to me as a player what it feels like walking off with the ball going in the hole for a birdie.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, it's always nice on, what would it have been, 5 and 6, I left myself very similar putts to that one I made for birdie and I under read both of them, missed them both just low.  And that one I kind of told myself play it out there, it's going to break.  And it was nice to finally get one outside the hole -- it almost missed high, but it broke right and went in.  So that was nice to make that little adjustment to see that one go in.
Q. So where are you with your career right now?  Golf has its peaks and valleys and everything.  Are you about where you expected to be at this stage of your career?
MARTIN LAIRD: I don't really know how to answer that.  I know I still have been out here awhile now and I still have the hunger and still want to be out here and be competing.  I mean it's, playing in tournaments like this and playing well it's what we do it for.  I've not really played, the last few years, I haven't really played as well as I maybe would have liked to, but I also have a four and two year old at home too, so it's no coincidence that my game took a little dive the last few years when I had kids and the kids became my priority over golf and practicing, spending time with the family.  But I think I got a pretty good balance now and I really, I do, I mean, I know you hear me say it all the time, but I really do feel like I'm playing a lot better now.  I've been finishing well the last really few months and I've been at it long enough I just keep plodding away and eventually those little streaks will turn into the results that you think you should be getting and then you wonder why it took you so long to get it.
