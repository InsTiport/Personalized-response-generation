   MARTIN LAIRD: ...par-5 and then the short par-3 and then the drivable par-4. You know, I hit a great shot in there to about 10 feet and two-putted that and took advantage of that par-5. It was a nice day.

 Q. Well, you shoot a 9-under par 62. You might need a couple more of those depending upon how these guys are going. It's out there with the low winds and the soft greens. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I mean it's like playing inside out there. Apart from the rains we got for those couple of holes, it's perfect. There's no winds, and as I said, the soft greens. 
 You know, it's definitely the type of tournament you just gotta keep firing and even when you're up 5, 6-under par, you know that's not good enough. You gotta keep going at pins, and that's what I did. So keep doing that this weekend.

 Q. Good feelings from last year, definitely, and trying to carry those over through the weekend?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah. I love this. Love this golf course because it's kind of a fun tournament to come and you know you gotta make a lot of birdies and it's not hacking up deep roughs like we do a lot of the year. 
 And it's just a fun week, kind of relaxed week, and hopefully keep it up this weekend.

 Q. Keep it going. Have fun this weekend. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Will do. Thanks.
