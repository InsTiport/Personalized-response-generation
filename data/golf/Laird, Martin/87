  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 MARTIN LAIRD: As I said, I feel like -- I made double bogey from the middle of the fairway and hit it out of bounds and shot 2-over. If you take that into consideration I played really well the other 16 holes.  
  
  Q. Is this your best Open round, though?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Nothing plays as hard as last year at St. Andrews, but it's tough out there and I struck the ball well. As I said, I'm most pleased with how I controlled myself out there. I can get impatient. That's pretty easy to do.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, yeah, you know, as I said, if I play like I did today, tomorrow, it shouldn't be a problem. This golf course you've just got to go and pick your target and hit your shot, and where it ends up it ends up because you can hit some good shots and it ends up -- I made birdie on 8, and really that was probably one of the worst shots I hit all day, my second shot. I pulled it left of the flag, was trying to cut it out to the right side of the green and I pulled it -- popped up, rolled down to about four feet and I made birdie. So it kind of swings around like that.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, you know, as I said, I played well there. I think I shot 5-under the last round in windy conditions around the Old Course. Putts like those last three holes you've got to hole those for par because you're going to have lots of them, and that's really what's improved over my last year or so. I feel like even at 2-over around this course, it's not something where the scores are going to run away. If you put in one round around par, you never know what can happen.
