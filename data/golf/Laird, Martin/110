 Q. Tell me about what kind of pressure you had and what it's like.
 MARTIN LAIRD: I was way out coming in two years ago. I was -- I knew I had to finish like Top-5 or 6. It almost helped me for the week. I come off a 4th place finish two weeks before and it helped me because I kind of freed up and, you know -- probably taught me a little lesson how you should normally play. 
 When you have this goal, got to finish for the FedExCup, I fired at flags all week and played good. I kept that going in the first FedExCup event and ended up playing all the way to the BMW.

 Q. Advice you give to other players in that situation.
 MARTIN LAIRD: You have nothing to lose. That's the kind of the thing that I had. You got -- when you know you got to finish that far up you got to go from the first hole on Thursday. You know the guys right on the bubble, it's a tough situation because especially if they are there by the cut line coming down the stretch on Friday, definitely has a little extra pressure. You need to make the weekend to have any chance.

 Q. This year it's a different story for you. How are you dealing with it this year? Obviously the higher you get the better.
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah. I came and played this week, my fourth week in a row and I came because I want to try to get as high as I can. I'm trying to play good enough this week and next week to make sure I get in the third one, the BMW. That's kind of my goal, to get back there. If you play good in the playoffs you can move up into higher spots. My game is starting to come around. I played well the last few weeks.
