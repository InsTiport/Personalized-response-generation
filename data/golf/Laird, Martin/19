Q. Great week, but how do you feel coming up just a shot shy at the week?
MARTIN LAIRD: A great week.  Obviously happy with it.  But a little disappointed right now.  I hit great putts on 17, 18, and they didn't go in.  A little disappointed but overall, I'm sure once I get past that, I'll look back and this was a very solid week all week.
Q. You certainly gave us something to cheer about on the 18th, what a beautiful putt you hit.  I thought it was in.  I think you thought it was in, didn't you?
MARTIN LAIRD: It was one of those ones, when it was halfway, I had the thought, I thought to myself, "I made this."  I was watching it, tracking.  I read it about half a cup out on left and I hit it right on a perfect pace, and halfway to go it was on the left edge of the hole and I thought it was in and it never moved the rest of the way.
Q. You made 122 feet in putts in the final round.
MARTIN LAIRD: That's probably more than I made the first three rounds combined.  I really putted really average the first three rounds.  This is probably one of best ball-striking weeks I've ever had in these tough conditions.  I don't know how many greens I missed this week, it wasn't very many.  It was nice to finally see some putts going in today.
Q. You came into the week 126th in FedExCup points and you're projected into the top 80.  That's really nice this time of the year.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, that puts a big smile on my face.  I wasn't really too worried about it with the way I was playing but now I really don't have to worry about it at all.  I can start playing in the first couple weeks of the Playoffs now, which is nice.
