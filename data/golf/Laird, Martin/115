 Q. Heck of a round and especially that dramatic last shot. When you saw it land, did you think it was going in?
 MARTIN LAIRD: I knew it had a chance to be close because I hit it good. I knew it was going to spin back. Then the crowd was getting louder and louder as the ball was getting closer to the hole. I knew I had a chance and nice to see it disappear.

 Q. Nice cap-off for a really solid round. Quite a few birdies as well?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I don't know if I would say solid. It was pretty up-and-down for the first six, seven holes or so.
 And then I didn't make a par my last 11 holes. Had a bunch of bad bogeys. But I also birdied, finished, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle. And I'm also very happy with 6-under.

 Q. Also posting 11-under in the clubhouse giving the rest of the folks behind you something to look at; that's got to feel good, too?
 MARTIN LAIRD: This golf course, and these conditions, it's not a course -- you're thinking you're struggling to come in. Every hole you're thinking let's make birdie. It's playing pretty easy right now. 
 I'm not expecting them to look at me and think they have to stay ahead. I'm sure they're going to go the other way.

 Q. Gives you good hope for tomorrow, A; B, if the conditions are like they are?
 MARTIN LAIRD: I'm playing great. I've hit it really, really good all week. Played good Thursday in the wind and played really nice yesterday. Didn't make any anything to shoot 5-under yesterday. I finally made some putts today and I need to tidy up the bogeys.

 Q. Have you ever had a round like that where you need an arithmetic degree to calculate. It was unbelievable. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: I was walking down the last -- trying not to think about it. I was like this is probably the last, not make a par my last 11 holes. I was going great after 7 holes, playing really with 3-under. Sorry, after eight holes 3-under. And hitting it in the water on 9 and hit bad chip on 10 and all of a sudden going the other way, up-and-down.

 Q. You've been having a really good year. You played in the Open. Been a consistent year. What's the greatest thing you've learned out here on the PGA TOUR?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Last year I learned I was in the same position, played bad the first half of the year and played good after a vacation. 
 That's something I'm definitely a lot better at this year than last year. Like today, when I made a couple of bogeys in the middle of the round, probably lost my head a little bit and probably not finished like I did. But I needed a day to kind of stay in them, played really well. The putts are going to go in.

 Q. Last question. You got yourself into contention. What would a victory mean here to you tomorrow?
 MARTIN LAIRD: It would mean everything to me, obviously. That's been my goal all year. Especially my position. 
 But I really like this course. I finished 4th here last year. I love the setup. Nicholas course, I like to play it. A lot of good holes for me.
