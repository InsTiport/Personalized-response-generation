 Q.   Your thoughts after that?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm obviously very disappointed.   You never want to go out, especially I didn't play very well off today.   I started off‑‑ got off to a great start and then had five holes during the middle I made four bogeys.   And I've got someone with as good a player as Lee Westwood, you can't do that.  
   
 Q.   Just a case of running out of steam?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   No, I don't think it was running out of steam.   Just had a couple of bad yardages, hit bad shots.   And then coming up 9, I had a good number and hit a bad shot.   So that wasn't really the reason.   I don't know what it was.   I'm obviously disappointed.  
Lee didn't make a bogey today.   I knew it was going to be tough.   He played very solid and I just didn't have it.  
   
 Q.   All in all a lot to take from this week?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   Definitely I'm going to take a lot from this week.   I played really, really well the first three rounds.   I needed to play that well today to win.   And obviously Lee is playing really well also.   And, no, anytime you can make it to Saturday in this tournament you're happy.  
   
 Q.   It's a decent foundation to build the rest of the season from?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   Definitely.   I came in here after not too bad results on the PGA Tour.   And to get to Saturday, I'm going to take a lot out of this.
