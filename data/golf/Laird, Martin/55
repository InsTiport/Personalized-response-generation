Q.   What were scoring conditions like today?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, the course setup was a little different today.   The pins were a lot harder, especially on the front.   There was a lot of tough pins starting out.   I played pretty well today to shoot 1‑over.   Didn't putt great, didn't really make any but played very solid.   Drove the ball‑‑ I'm not sure how I missed a fairway all day, drove the ball a lot better than yesterday, which was nice.   But it was tough today with the wind kind of swirling around and tougher pins.

Q.   How was the fatigue issue today?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Felt a lot better today.   I didn't do anything last night when I finished, didn't practice or anything, just went home and watched some TV and fell asleep on the sofa.   It was nice to get some rest.   I felt fine today and I was hoping to make a couple birdies coming in and see if I could sneak in, but I think I'll come up a little short.

Q.   What's your schedule coming up?
MARTIN LAIRD:   My schedule is I'm next going to play Quail Hollow, Wells Fargo in Charlotte, and then THE PLAYERS, and right now I'm in the in the other two majors so I'm going to be doing the international qualifier for the Open and then obviously the qualifier the week before the U.S. Open.   I don't know when the cutoff for top 50 is, but if I have a good week here in the next few weeks at THE PLAYERS or Quail Hollow, hopefully I can get in the top 50 and can get in automatically.

Q.   Do you plan to play the French Open this year, too?
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm not sure of my schedule really.   It all depends on how I do getting in these tournaments. 

Q.   Today when the rain came how did the course change? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   I mean, it didn't really change club selection.   Actually when the rain came it probably got a little easier in terms of the wind died down for about an hour.   Now it's probably playing harder than when it was raining.   It's just not as pleasant to be out here in rain.   That's about it.

Q.   Is it headfirst then into the stress of moving house or will you rest first?
MARTIN LAIRD:   No, we'll be back in Arizona before we do anything.   I'll enjoy the last week.   I've not had a chance to do that yet, so I can do that next week and celebrate with some friends, then head to Charlotte.   First tournament we'll be staying at home playing Quail Hollow, so it'll be good. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm definitely going to play the Scottish Open.   That one is always on the schedule.   I'll be back for that regardless if I qualify for the Open or not. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:   No, it was to deal with three‑hour time changes every week playing over here and four‑ to five‑hour flights home every Sunday night.   Now we're about an hour and a half every week, no time change.   We don't leave Charlotte until Tuesday morning.   I'll fly out, play nine holes Tuesday and‑‑ or on Wednesday.   It's a lot less stressful than leaving early Monday and getting in Monday night.   It just makes it so much more relaxing, can even go home between tournaments.   That's really why we did it.

Q.   Any examples of the wind switching, kind of catching the ball‑‑
MARTIN LAIRD:   You know, like 13, for example, I hit a good drive down 13, and if you went off the way the wind had been all day, it should have been off the left for the second shot, but you stand in that fairway and it's straight into your face, so you've got to play it straight into your face.   You know, it's always a little disconcerting when the wind has been going one direction the first 12 holes and then you stand in the middle of 13 fairway and it seems to have moved.   Yeah, it's just really down that stretch, 11, 12, 13 kind of really swirls around down in there.   Like we played the tee shot on the last straight left to right, and then the second shot played straight down, which it just kind of comes around the corner of the trees it seems there.   But yeah, it's just‑‑ this golf course is so penal if you miss your spots.   You've got a five‑yard circle to land the ball, and when the wind is blowing 10, 15 miles an hour it makes that a lot harder and a lot harder to get close to pins or even just get it on the surface sometimes. 

Q.   Have you bought anything or done anything to celebrate the win? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   No, not yet.   As I said, I'm not going to go anything stupid.   But I'm sure we'll buy something or do something to‑‑ I'll try to do something to celebrate the win. 

Q.   How do you feel leaving here?
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm obviously disappointed in how I played this week, but I'm definitely not going to let this week put any damper on last week.   Me and my wife were saying last night, I was kind of in a bad mood last night, after yesterday I was a little disappointed, and then we kind of looked at each other, like wait a minute, I won last week.   That's not a reason to be in a bad mood.   I don't know if we'll have a little celebration tonight or when we get back home.   Who knows.
