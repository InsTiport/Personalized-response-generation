  Q. Ten under par for three rounds around Firestone is exceptionally good, what is the secret of your success so far?  
  MARTIN LAIRD: I have played pretty much solid golf for the first three days especially today, I hit the ball really well and no bogeys round this course is really good. These greens are really good too so I'm feeling really comfortable on them and I know that if I keep hitting the ball the way I am and roll in a few tomorrow then I can make a charge up the leaderboard.   
  
  Q. You got married on Saturday, what are you doing here?  
  MARTIN LAIRD: If it was any tournament outside of this one or a Major, I wouldn't be here and it is tough to skip this week with such a quality field and such a good golf course. I played pretty good here last year and felt comfortable on the golf course and as I said this is only one of four or five tournaments that I would play the week after I got married.   
  
  Q. Did your win at Bay Hill convince you you could win any tournament in the world, even with a field as good as this one?  
  MARTIN LAIRD: Yes it did. That was one of the strongest fields outside the majors and the world golf championships that we play all year and to go somewhere like that and win around such a tough golf course, that really showed me that it doesn't matter what the setting is or how tough the course is that I can come out on top and that is important coming into a tournament like this. Last year I probably came here thinking that I couldn't win but this year, even though I hadn't played for a couple of weeks, I came here thinking that I have a chance of picking up the trophy on Sunday.
