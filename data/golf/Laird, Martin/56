  MARTIN LAIRD:   I did everything pretty well today.   You've got to do that to shoot 5‑under around here.   I putted really well.   I've putted well all week.   Driver has been about the only club I've not hit well this week, and today I think I only hit it three times.   So, I've been hitting my 3‑wood great all week and I just kind of relied on that today.   Around here if you get on the fairway, it doesn't matter if you've got 7 or 8‑iron, you can go at the flag.   If you're in the rough around here, it's hard to hit greens never mind get it close to the flag.   So that was my mindset today and it paid off.  
   
 Q.   You're pretty much the only player to go 2‑ or 3‑under.   Is the course playing that much more difficult today?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, the wind is a lot stronger and we got some trickier pins today on Sunday, and as you'd expect the greens are faster and firmer, definitely the speed.   They may not be firmer than yesterday, but they're definitely faster.   So you get on the wrong side of the hole, and it's tough to lag it down there as opposed to other days you can maybe have a run at it.   
Yeah, it's just Sunday at THE PLAYERS.   It's tough.   That's one of the best rounds I've played all year and one of the best rounds I've played in a while.   I think I probably played better today than I did last year when I shot 5‑under in the final round.   I think it was playing a little tougher today.  
   
 Q.   You came back from 5‑back to win the Valero.   Do you feel pretty confident in your weekend game?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I went in today actually confident, it sounds silly, but giving the leaders a push.   Because last year I came in 5 or 6 back in the last round and ended up finishing second with a chance to win, and I did it at Valero.   It kind of sounds weird to say when I was 5‑back I was not confident of winning, but I knew I could get in contention.   I had to get off to a good start, and did I that.   Once I started that, I wanted to keep going, and as I said, I played really well.
