Q. It was nice to finish early on a Friday afternoon with a clean card.  Tell me about the day.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, it wasn't very clean out there.  It was a clean card in terms of bogeys, but my golf game wasn't very clean.  I struggled a little bit with my irons all day, but my putting was probably the best I've putted in a long time.
A lot of nice saves where you're looking at a bogey and then rolling a 15-footer for par.  Those days are always nice.
Q. Just to back up your observations out there, you were seven for seven scrambling, bogey-free, 136 feet, 10 inches in putts.
MARTIN LAIRD: There you go.  I knew it would be a lot.  As I said, I think I only missed three greens yesterday, and today I think I missed probably seven or eight greens.
It wasn't quite as tidy tee to green, but it's amazing what a putter can do for you.
Q. Tell me about the golf course and how it's set up.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, you know, and early in the morning it's playing long, really long.  11th hole yesterday I had 3-wood/wedge, and today I had driver/6-iron.  That just shows you the difference starting early as opposed to in the afternoon.
When you're coming in in the morning with mid-irons to pins that are close to the edge, you'll play a little safer.  But the greens are so good.  If you get it inside 15, 20 feet, you really feel like you have a good chance at making it.  And I rolled some in today.
Q. Good day with the putter?
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, great day.  The putts, I made a lot of putts.  I made two bunker saves, holed probably 20-footers for my par putts.  Short-sighted myself in spots where I hit good bunker shots and went to 20 feet because the greens are so firm and rolled them in.
As I said, yesterday I hit the ball really, really well and putted okay.  Today I drove it well, but I didn't really hit my irons very good, but my putter was on fire.
Q. (off mic.)
MARTIN LAIRD: I don't know.  It's been a little while since I have made that many mid-length, 15-, 20-, 25-footers.  Finishing there, I made two of the last three holes, I made probably putts over 20 feet for par and birdie.  It's always fun.
Q. (off mic.)
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah.  Obviously I was really happy yesterday at 4-under, and then to go out and feel like I struggled a little bit tee to green, and to put up a better score today, I'm obviously really happy.
I think I know what I'm doing, causing my irons to be a little off.  Go down to the range after lunch and work on that.  If I can tidy that up and keep putting well, it should be a good weekend for me.
