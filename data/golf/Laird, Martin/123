 Q. Martin what a tournament it's been for you, 63, 74, you barely make the cut, go from 1st to basically the last guy to make the cut and bounce back today with a 64. Brilliant playing.
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I played good. I made a lot of putts today. About a 50-footer for eagle on a hole. Actually didn't feel like I hit it great but just the putter can save you.

 Q. Glad to see you make the par save at 18 the hole that bit you yesterday. You called the two shot penalty on your on yourself. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Just a mental error. Yang putted over my mark. I thought it would break a lot and it didn't break. That's what I was thinking, doesn't break as much as it looks, don't play as much to the left as I thought first and just I was thinking about it, I completely spaced out on my mark which it's my fault, no one else, and I've never done it before and I'll probably never do it again but it was just one of those things. 
 You know, honestly it was an anomaly at the time. It didn't upset me too much. I was more upset with a couple other golf holes.

 Q. You were the only guy who saw that, you called it on yourself. Golf is a gentleman's game, game of honor. You ought to be commended for that.
 MARTIN LAIRD: It's one of those things. I honestly -- I was so kind of into -- I didn't think I moved it back but I wasn't a hundred percent sure. That's why I made them check on TV. You know, one of those things.

 Q. Let's look ahead now. 64 puts you in the Top-10, Top-5 right now which is a long way to go. You're in position to cash a good check this weekend, get a lot of points.
 MARTIN LAIRD: As I said, my goal was to get into 144, the FedExCup, and I think the Top-10 will probably do it, so you're coming out this weekend. 
 I set myself a target for what I wanted to go under par this weekend and I've taken a big chunk off of it today and hopefully I can do the same thing tomorrow.

 Q. You were with Chez Reavie in Canada when he won. He said, "The same thing that happened to me, can happen to you." 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Oh, yeah. That was a big confidence for me watching one of my friends I've played a lot win like that. I've been playing good the last month. 
 Kind of Top-5 in Reno really gave me a lot of confidence. Obviously the first round here. I was confident coming into the weekend despite shooting 74 yesterday.

 Q. Great bounce back. That was fun to watch. Congratulations.
 MARTIN LAIRD: Thanks a lot.
