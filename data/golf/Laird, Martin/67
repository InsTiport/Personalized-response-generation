  MARTIN LAIRD:   You know, it was tough today.   The wind picked up a lot from the first couple days, and you know, this course gets firmer and faster as the week goes on.   Everyone knows that.   It's gradually getting a little harder.   I didn't putt as well today, so that kind of cost me a couple shots, but overall happy with even par.

Q.   A couple of bogeys back‑to‑back in the middle of the back nine.   You must have been thinking about the finish you had yesterday, but equally now pleased to have recovered so well?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, disappointed with those two bogeys.   First one was middle of the fairway, just hit a bad 6‑iron, and then the second one hit a bad tee shot.   Disappointed with those two in the middle, but had really good looks at birdie on 17 and 18, and after my finish yesterday obviously I kind of wanted to get a little bit of payback on those three holes.

Q.   Looks like it could be a good week.   You're inside the top 10 going into the final day. 
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I know Kuchar is pulling away a little bit.   I'm five back of him.   But between me and him, there's not that many guys.   It's not like there's a bunch of guys at 10 and 9.   Tomorrow is going to be tough.   Anything can happen, as we saw yesterday, over the last few holes.   So hopefully I can post a good round and see what happens.
