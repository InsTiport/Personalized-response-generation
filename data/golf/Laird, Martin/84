 Q. Congratulations on your wedding this past weekend. Some of the guys came out?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, obviously it was a very special weekend last weekend in Colorado. I had a few faces from out here on TOUR there, which was fun. But yeah, it was nice to get away from golf for a couple weeks with the wedding, and then it felt good to be on the golf course again today.

 Q. Your first round since the British Open. How did it feel? Did you have to remember which way to go?
 MARTIN LAIRD: I really haven't played in two weeks, since Friday of the British Open. I played nine holes with some friends last weekend. I was kind of curious to see how I'd be this week, and I came out here on Tuesday and hit the ball great warming up and went out and played pretty good. My coach was here and we worked on a couple of things. But I was kind of excited to get back on the golf course again. I wasn't so much burned out, but I definitely am fresh right now. I was excited to go today, and surprised how well I hit the ball.

 Q. Even par through the first side, then you made the turn and stuff started happening. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I really hit the ball great all day. I had one messy hole for a double bogey, but the only difference between my front nine and then the back nine was I made some putts on the other nine. I really hit the ball well today, and I could have been three or four better, but I'm definitely not going to complain with 4-under around this golf course in the first round.

 Q. Not your first rodeo here. You like this course?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I do. It sets up really well for me. It's long and you've got to drive the ball well, and that's what I did today. I drove it well. And if you're in the middle of the fairway around here, it makes a huge difference. The course is in fabulous condition. The greens are perfect. If you're hitting it in there birdie range and you hit a good putt, there's a good chance it's going to go in, so that's why there's some good scores out there today.

 Q. You've won at Arnie's place, Arnie has a great tradition here, it would be good to put this one on top of it?
 MARTIN LAIRD: It sure would. It's a long way from happening yet, but if I keep hitting the ball like I did today, I'll definitely be around there on Sunday, and that would be kind of a special couple of weeks for me.
