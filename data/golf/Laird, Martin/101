  Q. Talk about the day.   
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, real nice day. Starting on the other two courses you got to get these two, especially when it was a perfect day today.   
 I hit it real solid and finally made a couple putts. Not really -- I've hit it good the last two days, not really made anything. I finally made a couple today, so it was nice.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you have any advantage tomorrow since you got the harder ones out of the way?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: All these courses, if you play good, you know you can go low. But I think it's an advantage that we get to play here, we kind of stay at PGA West for the last three rounds, we don't have to go over to SilverRock and then come back here on Sunday. Because this course and the Nicklaus are very similar styles of courses.   
 But apart from that, it's not much different. You can't really look at the leaderboard too closely until everyone's played all four courses.  
  
  Q. Plans for the weekend? To win?   
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I mean, I'm in a good position, I didn't really know how I would play this week, coming off not playing a tournament for three months or however long it's been, but obviously pleased with how it started.   
 The course is in great shape, so you know you got to go low, because you got to keep firing away at flags, because you know other guys are going to. So that's the plan this weekend, just keep doing what I've been doing.
