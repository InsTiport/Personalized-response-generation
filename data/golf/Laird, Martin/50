  MARTIN LAIRD:   It's playing pretty easy with the way the wind is, all cross‑winds, and the two drivable par 4s are reachable today which was not the case yesterday.   Some good scores out there. 
I played okay but 7‑under is still in a good spot, so looking forward to the weekend. 

Q.   How do you feel you're placed going into the weekend? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   You know, right now I'm only five back, which is definitely in touching distance.   I hit the ball really well yesterday.   Didn't really make any putts and today I just didn't drive the ball that great and my iron game was pretty bad today.
Overall, 3‑under is pretty good, and as I said, in a good spot, looking forward to the weekend.

Q.   What kind of score do you think it's going to take? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   If the conditions stay like this, I think it will be 20‑under at least.   You know, I don't know what the forecast is, it's supposed to get a little cooler‑‑ if the wind doesn't pick up, the course is playing so fast.   You can hit drives almost 400 yards now. 
The par 5s are playing short and the course is kind of for the taking if it doesn't blow.   If it's the same, you're probably looking at low 20s. 

Q.   69, 3‑under for the day, 7‑under for the championship but maybe you might feel a bit frustrated? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I didn't play great today.   Played pretty average.   Overall, 7‑under is not bad for two rounds.   Hopefully today was my off‑day and I can have a good weekend.

Q.   What were conditions like? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   It was windier yesterday afternoon than it was today, but there was a little breeze out there from the start this morning.   It was lovely and warm out here.   The ball is going a mile and the fairways are firm and fast and the course is playing pretty short.   There's already been some good scores, and I think they will continue into the afternoon.

Q.   What were the bits of the course you let get away from you? 
MARTIN LAIRD:   I really didn't hit a good shot until about my sixth hole today.   I just had the blocks going coming out and had a few of them on the back nine, too, that cost me a couple of shots.   I kind of held it, scrambled well, had a couple really nice up‑and‑downs and held it in there.   As I said, 7‑under is a good spot so hopefully that was my bad day out of the way.

Q.   A Tiger Woods‑like question; 7‑under, you might be five, six, seven back; if you really needed to get into contention over the weekend what would you have to do?
MARTIN LAIRD:   If conditions are like this tomorrow, I mean, I'm probably thinking I've got to shoot 12‑ or 13‑, 14‑under on the weekend to win if the conditions stay the same.   It's out there and I feel like I'm playing well, so if I hit the ball a little better‑‑ I putted well today.   If I putt like that over the weekend and hit the ball well, I can definitely do it.

Q.   In these conditions come Sunday night, 19‑under, 20‑under might win?
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I think if it stays like this, you're looking at those scores.   The weather is so good, and the course is in fantastic shape but it's so firm it's playing short right now.   Some guys are going to be hitting it miles and have some short irons into some holes that are not playing long now.   It's going to be interesting to see what happens over the weekend and I'm looking forward to it.
