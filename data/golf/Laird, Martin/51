 Q.   With 69 you move to 10‑under, it's enjoyable but obviously not easy.   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, you know, I'm surprised the scores are not better today.   I played lovely today.   Just didn't make a putt all day, and you know, kind of speed of the greens‑‑ the greens rolled great but I'm not used to greens this slow and I left four or five a little short in the middle today.   
Frustrating to finish, especially par on the last, when it's easily reachable coming down the last but I was right there.  
   
 Q.   Ernie Els said the greens are gorgeous but he just can't get them or read them right.   
MARTIN LAIRD:   There's lots of subtle breaks on these greens.   You can have a 15‑footer with three different breaks on it.   You never really have a nice, you know, gradual breaking right‑to‑left or left‑to‑right putt where you can kind of see easily they might break a lot.   
As he said, they roll great.   It's nothing to do with the quality of them.   They are just tough to read and a little slower than I'm used to, but hopefully tomorrow I can get the ball to the hole and hopefully make some.  
   
 Q.   The conditions seemed reasonably benign today; how many opportunities did the course offer up?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, you know, I shot 3‑under today and I could have shot a lot better.   I mean, I thought it was playing pretty easy.   All the par 5s were reachable‑‑ well, actually 12 wasn't but the other threes were and a couple par 4s were reachable.   I wouldn't be surprised if somebody shot a 7‑ , 8‑under today and kind of stretched away.  
   
 Q.   If it stays like this, what do you think the winner will be on tomorrow night?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   Depends on the pin positions.   I didn't see them all today.   Probably some trickier ones today which has a little to do with scoring.   If it stays like this, I imagine 15 or 16 would be leading after the end of today; and I'll still stick with high teens, maybe even touching 20.   
   
 Q.   You sound a little frustrated‑‑  
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm very frustrated but I'm playing great.   Today was probably the best I played all week in terms of my ball‑striking.   I just didn't make any putts.   If I can make some tomorrow and cancel out the 3‑putts, I don't see why I can't make a charge.
