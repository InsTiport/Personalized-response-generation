  Q. Martin they're making a movie about a round, it would be a thriller. You had a lot of excitement on both ends of it.  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah. I got off to a good start. Hit a driver on 5. I had a good lie down there and hit one up there pretty close and made it.   
 You want to get off to a good start but you don't think 5-under through 5 in the middle of the round. Kind of -- you know, you got to keep firing out here and I started playing a little more defensively. Obviously, it was good the last four holes.  
  
  Q. Were you playing the mental game at all with what do I need to do today? Did you know it going out, did you think about it at anytime during the round, what do I need to do to make the playoffs?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: I knew I had to be Top-10. I set a goal after Friday on 12-under during the weekend and I'll get it done.   
 I shot 6-under yesterday and 7 today, so I got my goal. That was kind of the only thing I had. I figured 12-under on the weekend. I played really good.  
  
  Q. Good round, 63. You almost made it 62, 6 63, 64. That's got to give you a whole a lot of confidence going into next week.  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Definitely. I've been playing really good the last month. It's good. It's better week to week and Top-5 in Reno, giving me more confidence.   
 Nice off week last week to kind of recharge and my putter, I switched to the new putter the last two rounds of Reno and this thing, I made everything.   
  
  Q. Good luck to you as you head into the playoffs and down the road.  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Thank you.  
  
  Q. You were ten strokes back. What kind of mindset do you have to have, play your game or how do you look at it?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: I didn't look at winning the tournament. I figured I didn't have a shot, I figured I would have to shoot 10-under today. The course was giving up some birdies.   
 I wasn't thinking about winning, but go out and try and shoot 5-under, 6-under and see what happens. I shot 7. That's better.  
  
  Q. After four days here, what's your idea of the course?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: I really like it. I said to my caddy I really like it. Lot of 2-irons and 3-woods. We play courses all the time where it's driver every hole. Here you have to shape some shots and work the ball into some flags. I really liked it.  
  
  Q. The thing that you think maybe getting around about the course, getting a view from Forest Oaks and coming to a traditional golf course like this --  
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah. Everyone likes it. Greens are in great shape. I never played the old course. I can tell you that. There might be a few more guys that hear this is a really a good course that come next year. It's a good test of golf.  
  
  Q. The second round --  
MARTIN LAIRD: I was putting way too good coming into this. I had motivation. I gave myself a goal of 12-under for the weekend and shot 13. It was a very good weekend.  
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about playing in the playoffs.  
 MARTIN LAIRD: That was my No. 1 goal. Obviously to do it, it's good. I guess right now I'm 122 so, you know, have a good week next week and I'll be in a couple more. That was my No. 1 goal and I got it.  
  
  Q. As a rookie, what did you know about the playoffs before?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: I watched it last year, obviously, but I didn't really study it too much. All I know, you want to get in there. If you're playing good you have a chance to go on. I've been playing great the last month. Keep on next week and keep going.  
Q. Any shots down the stretch Friday where you made some big putts to make the cut?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: On 9. I knew on the green I had two putts to play this weekend. It was probably big for me.  
  
  Q. How many feet?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Probably 65 feet up over the ridge.  
  
  Q. Do you think if you miss that you 3-putt?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah. No, I'm not thinking of that.  
  
  Q. You might go home?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: I'm not going home now. I'm going to New York next week.  
  
  Q. Then what?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Well, I'm sure they'll be happy for me at home. I'm not going to come back but they'll be pleased.  
  
  Q. Good playing.  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Thank you.
