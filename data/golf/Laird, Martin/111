   MARTIN LAIRD: I played really well today. The key to this course is driving it on the fairway and I drove it great all day. You can go for the flags and for a major it is playing relatively easy if you drive on the fairway and I did that today. There's a little breeze which is nice as takes the heat out but makes the first four or five holes into the wind tough but then you get a few downwind holes you can try and make your score on that's what I did.

 Q. Are you and Stephen Gallagher flying the flag for Scotland?
 MARTIN LAIRD: I had never met him before this week and we sat during the delay and had a chat. He is a really nice guy and we were talking about having a couple over here and flying the flag. I love this course and hopefully I can keep it going.
 Bogeyed the first when I got a flier out of the rough. It was an interesting start not being able to see the first fairway when they made us go. After that it was solid and anytime you shoot two under in a Major is a good thing.

 Q. It was a bit like a grizzly day in Scotland out there first thing?
 MARTIN LAIRD: Maybe if you take the temperature down 20 degrees. But it is the same for everyone and once I got started I was excited to go.
