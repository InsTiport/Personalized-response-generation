  MARTIN LAIRD:   Not too happy, 2‑over, but another good week.   You know, I played, as the day went on, I started hitting a lot better shots.   My short game was not very good today.   I don't know if the greens were slower because of the wind but I just really struggled getting the ball to the hole and any time I did, I pushed it or pulled it, and that was really the case today.   I didn't putt very well at all. 

Q.   Just suddenly the wind blows‑‑
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, obviously that had something to do with it.   It was tough to get close to a lot of the pins.   The course setup was tough today.   Yesterday I thought the pins were slightly easy and today they toughened them up, as they should be on a Sunday.   With this wind picking up, some of those holes are playing very tough, and just didn't really give myself enough good looks, and when I did, I didn't make them. 

Q.   Is this what you can expect next week at Lytham?
MARTIN LAIRD:   I wasn't really out there thinking about next week, but you know, looking back, that's one thing that was good about today, get used to hitting some of those shots.   As I said, I got more comfortable and started hitting a lot better ones coming in, controlling my ball flight a lot better.   Starting the round, I struggled a little bit with that. 

Q.   Do you ever find it's easier in the wind‑‑
MARTIN LAIRD:   I don't see any difference really.   As I said, I struggled with the pace of the greens today.   I just couldn't get the ball to the hole all day, especially in the wind, I was leaving them not just a foot short, but five, six feet short; 30, 40 feet, and leaving myself a lot of work from there.
