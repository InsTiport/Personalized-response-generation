  Q. 3-under par, 69, excellent start.  If we can get some comments on your round.
 MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, very happy with that.  It was a little breezy out there, especially early and cool this morning, so both front nine and back nine the first three, four holes are some tough holes.
 I was really pleased to get off to a good start through my first four, five holes and then just kind of kept it going.
 Q. 2011 champion here.  Obviously it's important to you from that standpoint, but just talk a little bit about the tournament as a whole and Mr. Palmer's legacy as well?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, of course, even before I won, this was a tournament you always wanted to get in, just because of Mr. Palmer being associated with it.  And now as a past champion it's always very special coming back.  It doesn't get old seeing all the umbrellas and just being here, the feel of this tournament, it's definitely one of the special ones that we play.
 Q. Nice today to have some fans out.  Just talk a little bit about that.
 MARTIN LAIRD:   We were talking about that, yeah, it's nice to hear some cheers and a little bit of energy from the fans, it was fun to play in front of a crowd again.
 Q. Excellent start, just talk about your expectations for the rest of the week.
 MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, just keep doing what I did today.  I feel like I'm playing pretty well I've been hitting it nicely the last few weeks, my results just haven't been here.  This is a course you got to stay patient on, it's a tough golf course, you got to drive it good and then take your chances when you get them.
 Q. The social media stuff that the European Tour is doing, how creative they have become and whatnot.  How aware are you of that kind of stuff?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   I am not -- I am probably the worst person to ask that, I'm not on any social media, so, yeah, sorry, I can't really -- I've seen some of it and it's great and some of them are funny, but I really haven't seen most of the stuff.
