  Q. 5-under 67 here on Friday, how would you break down your effort here?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, I played really nicely today.  It was getting a little baked out, out there around the hole those last few holes, but very pleased.  I drove the ball excellently yesterday and with the rough we got here this week you need to do that.  If anything, I think I maybe even drove it a little better today.  That's kind of the important thing around here right now, getting the ball in the fairway.  So I've been doing that for a couple days and hopefully it can continue.
 Q. You missed the last three cuts coming in, what clicked for you this week?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   There's nothing really clicked.  I played really well the second round in L.A., barely missed the cut after a terrible first round.  I knew my game was pretty good, I've been getting a little impatient on the golf course the last few weeks and really made a conscious effort these last, the second round in LA and then this week, to just not worry about anything else, just focus on myself and stay as patient as I can.  And it's been paying off.
 Q. You won here a decade ago, how does that help you heading into the weekend, knowing that you've gotten the job done here before?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, obviously good feelings about this place after winning here, but this course, I like it, it's a hard golf course.  I feel like it's a course you really got to pick your spots where to -- there's two or three times I said to my caddie, it doesn't even matter where the pin is, you're just trying to get it to the middle of the green.  And I like golf courses like that where you really got to pick your way around it and pick your spots to be aggressive.  So hopefully I can keep making good decisions the next two rounds and see what happens.
 Q. How do you think things might change with the weather expected to roll in?
 MARTIN LAIRD:   It's expect to be a little wet tomorrow, who knows.  It will definitely change.  This course is getting really firm and fast, especially around the hole, so that will change.  But it's still going to be tough.  Nothing's going to change for me, just going to focus on what I can do and see what happens.
