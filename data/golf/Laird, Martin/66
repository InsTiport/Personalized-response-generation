 Q.   How was today?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Same as yesterday, it's tough to put a good score up when you can't make a putt, and I think I made one putt over about five feet in two days.   
Yeah, obviously very disappointed to be down after two rounds, but you know, can't get too down on myself.   Just a couple of bad days.  
   
 Q.   Any part of your game that you're happy with right now?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, to be honest, I'm really happy with all my game.   I just didn't play very well today.   Today was tough out there this afternoon.   We definitely got the harder side of the draw out there being out there in the afternoon.   That last five or six holes is about as hard as you'll ever play.  
I feel like my game is good.   I had a good warmup this morning, and hit the ball well when I went to the range after my round yesterday.   It was just one of those weeks where I could not get any scores done.  
   
 Q.   Better happens not the time to ask but where does this leave you with your summer here on The European Tour?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   I still have the same plan as before.   You know, I'm going back to America to play the week before the U.S. Open in Memphis, and then I play the U.S. Open, and then I'll be back over here for French Open, Scottish Open and The Open Championship.   
Looking forward to coming back, but as I said, disappointed to be done after two rounds here.
