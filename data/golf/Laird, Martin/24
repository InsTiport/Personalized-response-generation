Q. 3-under par today.  Traditionally the more difficult of the two courses.  Talk about the start you got off to today.
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, anything under par around here, you're pretty happy.  I was real happy with my play today.  I played really nicely all day.
I got off to a great start.  I was 5-under through 11.  And really just made one bad swing all day on 4, off the tee.  Apart from that, I played great all day and very happy.
Q. What's the most important part of your game to have around this South Course?
MARTIN LAIRD: You have to drive it in the fairway around here.  The rough this year, it's always pretty thick, this year it seems a little juicier than the last few years.  If you're not in the fairway, you got no chance.
And I drove the ball really well today.  Only one drive that wasn't ideal.  That was kind of what -- because if you drive it well around here, you can have chances.  There are some short holes, if you're in the fairway can you go at flags.  If you're not doing that, you're in trouble.
Q. Excited to be a couple under par with a chance at the easier North Course traditionally?
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, it's probably my favorite event of the year.  How can you beat being out here on the South Course with these views and this weather.  Farmers is always a fantastic event.  When you get weather like this, it's tough to beat it.  I just love being here and it shows with how I play.  I generally play pretty good here because of that.
The North Course is -- it used to be a little easier than it is now, but it's definitely one that is probably a little easier.  But I'll just go out tomorrow and hopefully drive the ball well again and see what I can do.
