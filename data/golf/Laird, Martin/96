 Q. Talk about your round today. 
 MARTIN LAIRD: I got off to a great start on the first hole. No. 10 is a great little hole, tricky little one, and hit a nice pitch shot over the bunker in there close and made birdie. Just played nice all day, made two bogeys and six birdies, so obviously very happy.

 Q. There's been some rain early in the week but the course is in pretty good condition? 
 MARTIN LAIRD: I played a practice round on Tuesday and the course was firm and fast and it was perfect. And then we got the rain. But even today it's firmed up a little and the greens are still perfect, which is unbelievable work by everyone here to keep the course in such good shape.

 Q. What were the keys to your round today? 
 MARTIN LAIRD: I holed some nice putts. I hit the ball well, but any time I hit a good shot in there I took advantage of it. I got a little lucky on 18; I hit it about 30 feet behind the hole, and if it didn't hit the hole it was probably going 15 feet by, and it hit the back of the hole and went in. It was just one of those days where a couple things like that happen, and all of a sudden I'm happy.
