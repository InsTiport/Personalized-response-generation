  Q. Bogey-free 5-under 66, good start to the week?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, very good. I like this golf course. Last year was my first year here and I liked it. It always helps when you come somewhere that you like and feel pretty comfortable here. You have to drive it pretty good around this place. Got a new driver in the bag last week and been driving it good last week and this week so far.   
 A couple of good saves in the end on 7 and 8. 7, I hit a bad 3-wood left of the fairway and kind of got up-and-down from 80 yards out of the rough for par. That was nice.   
 And then on 8, hit a bad shot left of the green and holed a seven footer for after chipping up. Apart from that, those were the only two holes that I had to grind for a par. Would have been a little disappointed if I had not got those two up-and-down and only shot 3- or 4-under.  
  
  Q. Great start, 5-under, thoughts on going forward from here.   
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, get out early tomorrow. The greens will be perfect, because we will be one of the first groups. Weather is awesome. You can't get better scoring conditions than this.   
 Last year the greens were a lot firmer, and I thought this week with the greens being softer, the scores would be a little bit lower, but there's quite a lot of rough out here. It's one of these courses you have to get in position off the tee. You have to scramble it around and if you keep driving it good, you can take advantage of it.
