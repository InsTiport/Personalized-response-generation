  Q. 3-under Martin. Happy?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Obviously happy. I felt like that was about as high as I could have shot today. I played really well today and not a lot of putts -- I chipped in the first for birdie which was nice and then after that, the second and third hole missed putts inside six feet for birdie and mostly happy to shoot 3-under when I really feel like I left -- 15 there's another one 3-putting from the fringe -- I felt like I left three or four shots out there, so, but obviously happy with how I played today.   
  
  Q. The shot on 16, an epic shot. Did you think you holed it for a minute?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Oh, it was a perfect number. I hit 8-iron and I knew that to get it there I had to just smash it and I hit it as good as I could. And it's a nice pin to know you can't hit it over, so it let me go for it. So I was really happy, especially after not making par on 15.   
  
  Q. Did you have this sort of score in mind?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: No, not really. I knew that I had to keep, if not improving on yesterday, do the same as yesterday. And if I keep shooting in the 60s I'll keep going the correct way up the leaderboard. And obviously pleased with shooting 3-under, but obviously a little frustrated that it wasn't lower today.   
  
  Q. What did the win in Athens do for your career?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Well, you know, it gave me a lot of confidence and I really, it really made me feel like I could win on the Nationwide Tour and then get on the PGA TOUR. And I just said from there I've been, I kept getting better every year and kept moving up.   
 So there's stepping stones every level and that was definitely one on the Nationwide Tour. So it was definitely a big confidence boost for me.
