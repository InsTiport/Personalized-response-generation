MARTIN LAIRD:  Sometimes the situation got in the way,
but it was not like that yesterday, it was just kind of a freak
show out there.  I said to my caddie I don't remember the last
time I hit a shot like that.  I hit 3-wood off the tee, hit it in
the right rough every day.  Then I hit it on the green and made
par.
I've hit it in the right rough every day and I've played
the hole -- hit it on the green three times and missed the green
badly one time.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:  I mean, yes and no.  It's the first time
I've really gotten in the mix in a Major, I know that my game in
the position now that I know I can compete.  I didn't need this
week to kind of prove it to myself.  And like I said, I didn't
really play that great on Friday and I was still 6 going into the
weekend.  I hit the ball great warming up on Saturday.  I just
really wish I could replay No. 3.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:  I'm not sure yet.  All depends.  I really
don't know my schedule after the playoffs.  Really going into the
end of the year.  We'll have to wait and see how to go.  I'm going
to decide what I'm going to do after that depending on how I do in
the playoffs.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:  Oh, yeah, I mean, obviously I want to win
golf tournaments, and winning golf tournaments is going to help me
in the rankings.  Obviously you're playing well if you're having
good finishing.  But I want to be in contention in tournaments
like this.
The good news for me is in three weeks' time there's
another Major on a golf course which everyone has told me I should
like and should suit me.  And two weeks' time there's the WGC on a
golf course that may be my favorite that we play all year in
America.  So I've got two great events coming up.  So next week
will be nice to kind of look back on this one, and get over it and
get ready for two huge events coming up.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD:  Next year, yes.  Yes.  And then as I said
it will depend, the playoffs, what I do the rest of the year.
