 Q.   And how do you describe what went on?   Seemed like there was a little bit of everything out there today.   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, just didn't drive the ball very well again today.   It's a tough golf course from the rough.   I putted great yesterday, and today the speed‑‑ I thought the greens were maybe a little slower today and just struggled with the speed a little bit and a couple of three‑putts for bogeys.   But saying that, still had a chance with three holes to go.   Drivable par‑4 and two par‑5s to maybe shoot 3‑ or 4‑under, and unfortunately finished three pars.   A little frustrated with the finish, but I just said to my caddie coming down the last, I really didn't play very well today and still shot 1‑under, so I'm still in the tournament.   Not if Moon continues what he did today because he played unbelievable, but I'm still right there.  
   
 Q.   How do you try to get back to the form you saw the first two days?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   I'm going to go to the range right now, hit a few balls.   Yesterday I went there after I played and hit it great on the range, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on‑‑ the difference between my range swing with the woods and then the golf course and then hit a few putts.   I think the putting was just an off day.   Early I didn't really have the speed, and that kind of threw me off, so I'm not worried about that.   But I'm going to try and sort out the driver, and if I drive it well tomorrow I can be aggressive and try and catch him.
