 Q.   Martin, nice start to the tournament.   Just get some comments on your round.   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, played very nice.   You know, conditions were perfect this morning:   no wind and the greens were great.   Course is in great shape.   It was ideal golfing conditions.   
You know I was just talking to my caddie.   When it's like that and you're out early on a Thursday, it's nice to play well.   Then you feel like everyone else is playing catchup.   
So very happy with my round.   A little disappointed that I missed about a three‑footer on the last and I bogeyed ‑‑ my only bogey on the golf course was the easiest hole on the golf course, a drivable par‑4.   
Apart from that, I played great.  
   
 Q.   Any birdies that stand out?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   You know, birdie on 16, the par‑3.   I just laid up on the drivable par‑4 and made a terrible bogey.   And then I kind of choked my way up the next hole, and then 16 is probably the hardest hole on the golf course, the par‑3.   
I had a great 6‑iron in there and it came up like, I don't know, 30 feet short and I made that putt.   That was nice.   That's like a bonus.   That hole played well three this week, so to make a two there, it's a big bonus.  
I needed that one after kind of choking my way down a couple holes in a row, and finished nicely.  
   
 Q.   A few weeks left in the regular season.   What are your goals?   
MARTIN LAIRD:   Oh, you know, to win.   You know, I really struggled nearly all year, but the last few weeks I've really started to see my game come back.   I have been working on some things that I worked on in the past, and I feel like any game is getting a back to where it was, you know, 2012 and before.  
And a run like this, I love this golf course.   Played here twice before and had a chance to win both times.   For some reason just sets up good for me.   I look forward to coming here, and it's nice to start off with 13 points, which sounds weird.  
   
 Q.   You haven't been here for a while.   Anything new or different about the course?  
MARTIN LAIRD:   No.   I haven't been here in I think five years.   Practice round it took a couple holes.   I had forgotten about it, and then after one time around I remember them.   
I remember the greens being firmer.   They're a little soft this week, which means the scoring is going to be great.  
Some of these holes with the greens firmer are very, very difficult.   They're playing a little easier right now.   
If they keep getting firmer as the week goes on, the scores will start getting higher.   
I just like this place.   I like playing in altitude.   I played college golf at Florida State, so played in altitude for four years and feel comfortable.  
I think that's got something to do with it, too.
