Q.   Six birdies, no bogeys here in the final round.   Got to be feeling pretty good overall about the week. 
MARTIN LAIRD:   Yeah, you know, (indiscernible) my caddie coming up the last.   Considering how I played on Friday with three doubles and two (indiscernible) balls and a disaster run and whatever minus four points to finish, I don't know. 
I'm third right now.   I played great.   With the exception of that one round, I played as good as everyone else here.   Would've been right here with Geoff, but... 
It was a costly one, but overall I'm happy.   Sometimes it's easy, (indiscernible) take it into the weekend. 
But I knew I was playing great, and I played great again today.   Just would've been nice to see that one go in on the last, but we'll see if that makes a difference.

Q.   Is there any particular element of your game you feel good about after this week?
MARTIN LAIRD:   You know, really every part of my game is really pretty good.   My chipping was probably‑‑ had a few up and downs that didn't get up and down that I would like back, but I putted good.
I have been struggling a lot with my ball‑striking this year.   Last few weeks it's been getting a lot better.   This week especially I hit it great.   Friday I am just kind of throwing that in as a day that doesn't count, because the other three days I hit it great. 
That's really what I would say what I'm happy about this week.   All parts of my game were really solid.   Putted nicely.   I just like this place.   Finished second, fourth, and now, what else, you know?   Three times here and maybe three top fives.   So for some reason I feel comfortable here.   I like it.   It sets up if good for my game, so I'm obviously happy. 

Q.   Perfect.
