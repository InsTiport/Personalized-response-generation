Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: Missed two three-footers and didn't make anything.  But that was the hardest thing when it's blowing like this, is making putts.  No one in our group really made anything.
Honestly I didn't really play that bad tee to green and shot 9-over, because it's extremely tough.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: No, I had a couple where it was oscillating, but nothing moved.  With this wind, non-prevailing wind, this golf course is just a beast.  I mean, the 480 to 500 yard par-4s, are supposed to be playing downwind are playing straight into the wind.  And I'm hitting driver, 2-iron in there and yesterday was hitting lob wedge into a couple of them.  A lot of the holes are the easier holes, when it's -- I guess you could say these holes are the shorter ones are either hard left to right or down off the left winds, and it's tough to get it close.
So there's no doubt the golf course plays a lot harder in this wind direction and it's also blowing hard.  But obviously I'm really disappointed.  I said to my caddie, I'm not really playing that bad and I'm 9-over.  Putts are terrible but tee to green I was all right.  You've just got to make those ten-footers and then when it's like this, you're going to have lots of them for par.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: I don't know if the wind is going to pick up more than it was.  I saw the forecast, what is it right now, it's supposed to be kind of consistent.  If it's picked up anymore, the ball is blowing around, like you said.
But, no, I don't think it's probably going to be the same.  It was pretty windy all day out there.  And I don't know how much it will dry out.  I think there's some rain coming, too.  I think it may be the opposite.  I think it may be wet.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: I mean, yes and no.  The way this wind was, it was just hard for me.  I like to hit fades and yet the way the wind is with the prevailing wind, I can hit my cut and it sets up nice to the hole.  It felt like every hole today was opposite.  My fade was just like never the shot, it seemed like.  Seemed like I played a lot more holes off the left.  I don't know why, it's just the way the wind comes.
It's hard to prepare.  I mean, I've not played in conditions like this for a long time, for a good few years.  It's hard to make yourself hit 6-iron from 140 yards sometimes, and that's the club.  I could have done a couple of things better, club selection.  But as I said, it was really on the greens, just putted badly.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I live 40 or 50 minutes from the course, but I've played it a bunch of times, in the Wells Fargo tournament we play on the PGA Tour.  I've played the course a bunch and it's a lot different than this, and it's going to be unbelievably warm, and generally in the summer it's not that windy.  It's going to be different.  It'll be really, really hot and probably pretty calm.  It's going to be a tough golf course, too, but it's going to be one my game, hitting it high and fading, it's going to be more suited than here.  But it's a long away right now.
But as I said, it's disappointing when you miss the cut and you really feel like you're playing well.  I knew if I just battled out a bit better today and just stay anywhere around par, you're going to be a shot going into the weekend.  So I'm a disappointed right now.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: I mean, yeah, I wouldn't want to play in this every day, let's just say that.  It's fun to come back and I still love this week.  I still had a great week of links golf.  But I'll take playing golf in Arizona year-round over playing links year-round, I'll just say that.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: I love Carnoustie.  I played Carnoustie in the Dunhill a couple of times and a couple of other times just casually.  And I really like Carnoustie.  I think that's a great golf course.  So, yeah, no, hopefully fare a bit better there.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MARTIN LAIRD: Yes, that's what I heard.  I'll hopefully be back for a two-week stretch like this year, and hopefully play the weekend next year.
