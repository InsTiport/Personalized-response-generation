MARTIN LAIRD: I hit the ball really well.  I've been doing that all week.  Putting average so far, so hopefully I can make a couple more tomorrow.  I've been playing really solid, which you have to on a golf course like this in these conditions.  It's a bit blustery out there, so I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  In terms of the golf course conditions, how firm and fast it is -- how have you found it out there today?  
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, today they softened the greens up a bit.  I played late Thursday and it was the same Friday afternoon.    It was hard to stop the ball no matter what club you had.  They definitely put more water on it and I felt the course is accessible today.  It's hard to hit a lot of fairways out here.  I think the greens are a little softer but still is playing fast.   
 Q.  Some of your stats for the week so far, you're just outside the Top-10 on driving distance at the moment, 44 out of 54 greens in reg so far.  
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, that's kind of a premium on this golf course.  It's hard to get up-and-down around here with the greens firm.  Yesterday I missed one green in the wind, and that was one of the best ball-striking rounds I've ever had, and today wasn't much worse.  My strokes gained in putting might be misleading because I'm hitting so many greens.  I'm not hitting them close, and having a lot of putts.  I missed a few short putts, so hopefully I can get closer to minus two or even or whatever you want to call it tomorrow.   
 Q.  Minus six, how do you feel you're set for the final round challenge tomorrow?  
MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I'm in a good position.  I don't know what the leaders will go to.  The back nine with three par 5s, i gettable.  But obviously very happy with the way I played.  I can only all I can do, and wherever they go, they go.  As I said, I'm hitting it well and hopefully roll in a few putts tomorrow and we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  126 FedExCup, something you're starting to think about coming down the stretch?  
MARTIN LAIRD: I mean obviously I'm aware of where I am.  I really started playing well a few weeks ago.  I think I was probably more worried about it two months ago than I am now, because my game wasn't really good.  I was still inside 125 but I was falling fast.  It's kind of funny, even though I'm just outside now, actually I'm not really too concerned about it.  If I just keep playing like I am, I've been playing really well the last few tournaments, and if I keep doing that, that's not going to be an issue.  I'm not too worried about it yet.
