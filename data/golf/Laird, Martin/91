  Q. Just your thoughts on the day?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: You know, it was a lot of fun, playing with Tiger on Sunday at Augusta when he's making a charge up the leaderboard. It doesn't get much better. But just a little disappointed in how I played. But overall obviously happy with my week. First time here.  
  
  Q. That's the thing to concentrate on; that's a really good performance.   
 MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, especially the last hole just summed up my week. Didn't hit a very good tee shot, hit a good second shot and then hit a good putt, it just went over the edge. Had that all day today, just didn't make anything really. You know, and didn't drive the ball great again.   
 But you know, it's obviously going to take a while. It doesn't feel like I played my best this week and finished 20th, so that's obviously a sign that my game is in the right spot. Just takes time.  
  
  Q. Talk about the madness of playing with Woods.   
 MARTIN LAIRD: Some call it madness, but I wouldn't call it madness. It was a lot of fun. You know, his golf swing, hitting shots -- he hit some of the best shots you'll ever see today.   
  
  Q. Atmosphere?  
 MARTIN LAIRD: Atmosphere is unbelievable. Crowds are great out here. As I said, when you're playing with Tiger on Sunday and he's making a charge up the leaderboard, it doesn't get much better.
