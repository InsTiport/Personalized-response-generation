Q. You shot 4-under today, a 68 on the South Course.  I understand you started, did pretty well at 16, 17 and 18.  That must have been a big boost to your round today.MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, it was a nice little stretch there.  Any time you make three birdies in a row on the South Course you're happy because every hole out here is a tough hole. So I didn't drive it great, but kind of scrambled well today and hit some nice shots when I did hit the fairways and made some birdies. A little disappointed to hack my way down No. 9 there and make a bogey, but that's, I'm not going to complain, I'll take 4-under on this golf course any day.Q. How about the eagle on 6?MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, that's obviously a nice bonus.  I hit a great drive.  It was one of the only good drives I hit today.  A perfect 4-iron to that back left pin and it landed right on the front of the green where I wanted and chased up to about five feet and rolled it in. Obviously, it's hard to make birdies around here, so when you make an eagle, it's a double bonus, obviously. Then I went on and birdied the next hole.  So I had a couple of nice little runs in there, 16, 17 and 18.  And then 6 and 7.  I played those holes in 5-under so, that obviously helps.Q. A disappointing 9th, but still a good bounce back from last week.MARTIN LAIRD: Yeah, I'm playing well.  Last week was last week.  I made one bad swing, really, and I had a bad time and that was that. The rest of the tournament I played great, I putted great, everything in my game feels pretty good. So this is maybe my favorite course to play all year, the South Course, so I've been looking forward to coming here. Obviously you never know you're going to play good, but I came in here feeling pretty confident in my game, obviously and very pleased to start with a round like this on maybe the hardest golf course we play all year.
