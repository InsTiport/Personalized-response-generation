Q.
Talk about your day today, 4-under.
PETER LONARD:  Played ordinary early, I suppose, and my putter kept me in it.  Then I holed a nice putt on 17 to get it back to even par, and from then on I played pretty good.  I'm reasonably happy with it.  I left those two par 5s out there on that other nine, which I think the field is going to birdie really.  4-under is a good score, but I feel like a left a couple out there maybe.
Q.
What about the conditions?  Is it a little soft out there today?
PETER LONARD:  Yeah, softer than I was expecting.  After yesterday I thought the greens would be quite firm, but I thought the course was probably as easy as it's going to play all week.

No one really took a great deal of advantage of it apart from Jacobson.
Q.
Overall talk about the state of your game right now.
PETER LONARD:  It's good.  The first four months were crap, and then I had a lot of trouble getting it back together after the ribs and stuff.  Yeah, the last five, six weeks I've progressively gotten better each week, and I feel good.
Q.
Next week is a big week for you.  Do you feel good about that?
PETER LONARD:  Yes.
Q.
Have you played Shinnecock?
PETER LONARD:  I haven't played Shinnecock.  From what I hear it's sort of a linksy type of thing and you've got to keep the ball down, and that's right up my alley.
