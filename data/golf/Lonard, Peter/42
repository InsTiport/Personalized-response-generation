 Q.  Your thoughts on David as a player, and competitor, because I know you haven't played with him?
PETER LONARD:  He's a great player, and kept it in play pretty much all day.  And he made me sort of catch him in the end.  We had four or five holes to go and I was struggling to get him and then it wasn't good enough in the end.

Q.  The results weren't what you wanted, but are you proud of the way you've played here this week?
PETER LONARD:  Yeah, I think I've played well. 

Q.  Very exciting match.  You putted beautifully today, it just wasn't enough in the end?
PETER LONARD:  I probably didn't hit enough good shots, and when it comes down to it, I missed a few fairways coming down the stretch, and that's always important.

Q.  Having seen him up close, what are David Toms' strengths?
PETER LONARD:  He doesn't miss that many shots, does he?  He's always there, and he makes you make the birdies or take the risk to sort of catch him, and once he gets ahead he's a hard man to catch.

Q.  Do you give him a fighting chance against Tiger?
PETER LONARD:  Yeah, sure, if he drives it good like he did today, yeah, you never know.
