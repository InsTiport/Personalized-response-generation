Q. I take it the eagle was the highlight of the day -- what did you do there?
PETER LONARD:   I hit a great six iron to about a foot from about 190 yards.

Q. You had good three ball -- you all played well?
PETER LONARD: McGinley was great today.

Q. Does it help when all three of you are playing well?
PETER LONARD:  No I don't think so -- I don't think anyone takes any notice anymore. Maybe a little bit, but as long as the guys you are playing with aren't playing badly and throwing clubs around it doesn't really matter what your partner's doing.

Q. Is the course the bounciest you have seen it today?
PETER LONARD: Maybe the first bounce on the greens is a bit more than normal. Normally the greens are a bit more receptive I think. The fairways are usually really bouncy and the greens a bit more receptive whereas today the fairways were firm-ish but reasonable and the greens definitely are bouncy. I had a six iron into the first and I flushed it but it still bounced ten yards on from where it landed and that is a fair bounce on.

Q. You must be pretty pleased going into the final round and well in contention?
PETER LONARD:  Well, I didn't come here to come last or miss the cut. I'm here to try and win and hopefully I'll be around with nine holes to go and you never know do you?
