Q. Glad to be back here and looking forward to the week ahead?
PETER LONARD:  Yes, totally. This is a great course to play and having lived in Sunninghill for a while it feels a little bit like coming home for me.
Q. Do you know this course well then?
PETER LONARD:  I didn't play that much here outside of tournament golf, but I know the area really well and it just feels right being back here.
Q. You've had a pretty good season so far in America with your win at the Heritage and then third last week?
PETER LONARD: It's been OK, but pretty erratic to tell the truth. When I'm good I'm good and when I'm playing bad I'm bloody hopeless! But it was nice to win one and then be third last week so I've got a bit of money on the board over there in America.
Q. What have you found different over in America?
PETER LONARD:  Their courses are different. I think the main difference is that the opportunities to play your best are more improved over there because of the practice facilities that are right on your doorstep, especially where I live in Florida. You couple that with the weather and being able to practice more on your time off and that is the main difference.
Q. You obviously still want to play in The Tour's main events though?
PETER LONARD:  Yes, absolutely. I have kept my card here for the last four years since I left. I play the 11 tournaments and it feels good to be back for the BMW Championship because the Schedules have worked in my favour this year, so it all works out well.
