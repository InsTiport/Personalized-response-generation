Q.   Overall, great round out there today, talk about conditions maybe a little bit?
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, you know, it was actually playing pretty tough but the wind, especially our front nine, it was really swirling.   We were not sure where it was coming from.   It got a little more steady on the back side and we knew what it was doing. 
Yeah, I'm super happy with how I played obviously.   I had a couple chances coming down the stretch with birdies, 16, 17, 18, but played well. 

Q.   You've put yourself in good position now for the next three events for the Playoffs. 
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, exactly.   Coming in here, I knew that I would either need probably one really good week to get to Atlanta or a couple really solid ones or three kind of Top 15, Topâ€‘20 type finishes, so it's definitely a good start.
