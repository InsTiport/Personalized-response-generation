 Q.   Talk about round No.2 compared to round No.1.   Obviously the score was different, but I thought you still hit it pretty good.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, tee to green it was better today.   I wasn't seeing the lines on my putts.   I hit some good putts and just kind of misreading things.   Some days you see it and some days you don't.   I played nicely.   Kind of a stress‑free round.   I made one up‑and‑down on the 4th hole, and other than that it was pretty stress‑free, so I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   Three back going into Saturday.   You're in great shape.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, that was kind of the goal today was not to really get ahead of myself and try to play solid golf.   I would have liked to have a couple more, but yeah, I'm right in there and got a chance.  
   
 Q.   Talk about Saturday because more rain is coming.   Looks like you're going to have lift, clean and place again.   It's going to be the same scenario the first two days.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, you're just going to have to keep going low.   Getting the ball in the fairway is key, especially if you're able to clean and give yourself a perfect lie every time with these soft conditions.   If you hit it in the rough, especially on the par‑5s, you can't really get home in two.   So driving is going to be kind of a big advantage, and hopefully holing some putts.  
   
 Q.   You told us about the price tag on your putter.   Still there?  
GRAHAM DeLAET:   No, I mean, I actually felt like I didn't putt poorly today, just nothing really fell.   We're going to keep rolling with it.   It feels good.
