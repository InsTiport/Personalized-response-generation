GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, just one of those days.  This golf course is obviously very difficult.  It played about as easy as I've ever seen it in the years I've been here.  I was playing well, and even par through ten and I missed the fairway on 2 and I was kind of thinking to myself, man, if I make four here, I'm 1-over through 11 and I felt like I'm playing well.  But able to make par there and then kind of went on a nice little run to finish the day.
Q. Talk about the birdie at 8 to get you to 4-under par.
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, that was a nice putt.  I hit a really good shot, and I wasn't trying to be quite that aggressive.  Shot it right at the pin and made a nice kind of quick little downhill right-to-lefter, and it was a good day.  We've got a long ways to go.
Q. Was the breeze a factor, you mentioned how easy it was --
GRAHAM DeLAET: First of all, how soft it was but this place is notorious for howling winds.  It was a club, club and a half wind, nothing crazy.  We've seen a lot more and I anticipate we'll probably see it before the week's over.  I'm happy to be where I'm at right now.
