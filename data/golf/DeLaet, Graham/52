 Q.   The past two weeks gotta be just out of your mind as well as you're playing.   Last week just carried over into this week.   Wasn't the outcome you wanted, but you have to feel good about where you are.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, I have been playing well.   I have been playing well for the last few months, it seems.   I really feel like I worked super hard in the offâ€‘season, and it's nice to see it paying off.   
Disappointing here to be within one.   I think this is the fourth time now, but I'll be back I hope.
