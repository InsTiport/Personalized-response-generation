 Q.   Okay.   Gram DeLaet, 5-under, 67 1st round, good playing.   Talk about your round.  
GRAHAM DELAET:   Yeah, thank you.   Yeah, I played well pretty much all the way around.   I made some good putts today.   I hit one poor tee shot on No. 11, my second hole, hit it in the water.   Good start, happy with it.  
   
 Q.   Conditions had to be pretty good out there.   Not a lot of wind.  
GRAHAM DELAET:   Yeah, I mean, the nice thing was even though -- there was a little breeze, obviously, but it's the same wind we've played the last few days here.   So I mean there's nothing, no surprises anyway.   It seems like it's picking up here a little bit.   Go back in and have some lunch, and hopefully it picks up a little bit more.   Happy with that.  
   
 Q.   You guys were first out.   Obviously you had to warm up in the dark.   Is that a little bit of a hindrance?  
GRAHAM DELAET:   No, we're used to it.   We do that all the way probably until we get back to Texas for the Byron Nelson and Colonial.   That's when the days start getting longer.   We had good conditions.   Soft out there.   Kind of long iron shot.   Had birdie looks all day.   Hopefully I can keep that going for another three days.  
   
 Q.   Which birdies stand out to you today, Graham?  
GRAHAM DELAET:   Can't even think what holes.   I feel like I've played so many rounds.   We got here on Sunday.   I'm getting them all confused.   I made a nice birdie on 5, actually, that's a top hole.   Good 3-wood, 8-iron.   Made probably a 15-footer there.   That's a hole you're looking for par when you stand on the tee.
