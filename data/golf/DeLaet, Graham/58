Q.   Thoughts on that match? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I think, thinking about it last night, 8 and 9 was pivotal that we lost those two holes.   I hit a poor drive on 9 and had us on the back foot.   And then really this morning, they came out and hit it close and made every putt, and it quickly turned this morning so we couldn't get it going.

Q.   Now thoughts going into singles?
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, we're up against it.   We're just going to have to fight as hard as we can and if we can get enough blue going, we're looking for one of those miracle come backs I guess.   You know, otherwise, we all want to win our matches anyway just for our own pride.

Q.   An up‑and‑down match, but talk about the adrenaline after making a shot like that. 
GRAHAM DeLAET:   It was unbelievable.   Just one of the coolest feelings in my life really. 

Q.   Probably something you dream about doing in a major golf tournament or anywhere, but to be able to do it on the 18th hole of The Presidents Cup had to be pretty awesome?
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Exactly.   I was standing over it, and I was like, this is what we practice for.   We put in a lot of time around the greens, and it was a little grainy and it was super soft.   I just did all the technique we've been practicing with Gabe and it paid off. 
I found a really nice spot but my ball wouldn't stay there unfortunately and had to move it over to a spot that wasn't quite as good, and it worked out.

Q.   In terms of Keegan on top of you making it‑‑
GRAHAM DeLAET:   They made some really good putts down the stretch.   You had to play well to get a half point against those guys and that's the way it is.   Happy to get the half point, that was cool.
