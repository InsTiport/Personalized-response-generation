  GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, it hurts.  I mean, it's an important tournament to me, obviously.  I guess when it all came down to it, I felt if I could compete and still hit the ball well, I probably would have kept going.  But just I didn't have any kind of golf game out there today, and then it was hurting. I've still got the PGA coming up here in a few weeks, a couple playoff events before they make the decisions for the Presidents Cup, and I want to try to be healthy and make a good run with that team.  I guess more than anything kind of looking out for the future right now.   Q.  What is the actual extent of the injury, do you know?  GRAHAM DeLAET: I don't think it's anything too serious.  I'm going to go get some imaging done here and hopefully get back to Arizona and see the docs down there as well.  But I'm not a doctor, so I can't tell you exactly what's going on right now.  It's disappointing.   Q.  You talked about grinding yesterday.  You went out and played four holes and parred them.  But when did you realize it was time to shut it down?  GRAHAM DeLAET: Even my opening tee shot I hit 40 yards right, and my tee shot on 11, I hit 30 yards right, and my tee shot on 12, I hit 15 yards right with a 4-iron.  I knew I didn't have it.  I wanted to keep trying, but it was just kind of pointless. I think I need to shoot 3- or 4-under to make the cut today, and I felt like a 5-handicap, and that's pretty hard for a 5-handicap to do.   Q.  What was the progression of events between yesterday after your round until you decided to withdraw?  GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I did some cold plunges yesterday with some ice.  We taped it up today to try, and it actually did kind of help.  But just kind of in the end it was just kind of trying to be smart and not try to force anything.  It just sucks that it's this week.
