  Q. You played well. 67 here on Sunday.   
 GRAHAM DeLEAT: Yeah, it was a nice day, a nice way to finish off a pretty good week all in all. Think I probably secured my card, which was kind of the main thing coming into this week.  
 So it feels great. Disappointing 3-putt on the last kind of stings a little bit, but all in all a good week.  
  
  Q. At what point did you start watching the leaderboard? Did you know you were within a couple shots?   
 GRAHAM DeLEAT: I kind of always glance at it, so I kind of knew where I was the whole day. I was playing well. I knew that if I could keep making birdies - because it was tough out there -- you never know. I have a chance.   
 And if I could have birdied 18, you know, post 12, I thought that I would have a chance maybe. Unfortunately it was bogey and kind of dropped me out of it.   
  
  Q. Let's talk a little bit about the putt at 18. It was long putt 18, almost 50 feet, over that little slope and downhill to the hole location. Are the greens changing as they gather water then it drains out a little bit? What's going on out there for the players today?  
 GRAHAM DeLEAT: Yeah, a little bit. It's funny, because I actually said to my caddie, I don't think it's going to be crazy fast coming down that slope because of the dampness of the greens.  
 But, I mean, I don't know what happened. As soon as I hit it, I knew it was 10 to 20 feet past the hole. It was a terrible putt. Yeah, I think it is changing. The ball is not really spinning as much on the greens. They're kind of taking little skips instead and just kind of stopping.   
 So it's playing a little bit different than the last few days.  
  
  Q. Congratulations on securing your card.   
 GRAHAM DeLEAT: All right. Thanks.
