 Q.   Your thoughts on shooting 65 to get nicely in the mix?  
GRAHAM DELAET:   I'm still a long ways behind Dustin.   He's playing really well, running away with it a little bit.   I played bogey‑free, made a nice putt on the last to finish it off.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a sense there was a good score out there for you?   
GRAHAM DELAET:   Yeah, the conditions are good and the greens are great.   So if you can give yourself some looks, especially on the right parts of these greens, there's a lot of kind of different levels, and if you can get some uphill putts, it really helps and I was able to roll a good number of putts in today.  
   
 Q.   Looks like the last couple of days you were playing well, maybe not getting quite the breaks or birdies.   
GRAHAM DELAET:   The last few days I played really well.   The first day, it wasn't my best stuff but I hung in there to shoot 1‑under par.   I've got a chance tomorrow.   I'm going to have to probably take it pretty low but there's a chance.   This is my first WGC event and it's great to be here and it's the best players in the world, and to be playing well is that much better.   
   
 Q.   Are you enjoying the whole experience in China?   
GRAHAM DELAET:   Yeah, two weeks in Asia, Malaysia last week and here.   I'm looking forward to getting home.   This is my last event of the year, and looking forward to just relaxing and getting in the gym and enjoying the off‑season.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts, you mentioned Dustin being a bit ahead, but you can get a prominent finish here.   
GRAHAM DELAET:   Yeah, absolutely.   There's a lot at stake tomorrow.   I'd love to shoot a really good round and have a chance to win the golf tournament but at the same time, if I can play solid all day, a good finish would be a nice way to end the year.
