Q. Graham, you're off to a good start.  Five birdies on your first nine holes.  Nine points.  Just a few comments on the round.
GRAHAM DELAET: I played pretty well.  It wasn't quite the finish I was looking for.  But it was nice.  It's been a month since I've played out here.  So I was a little bit nervous on the first tee.  And it was a good start.
Q. How much do you have to kind of recalculate your game with the altitude?
GRAHAM DELAET: Yeah, I hit a sand wedge over the back of the green on our 17th hole, No. 8.  It was 140 yards.  I hit it over the green.
Every once in a while there's some like fluke shots, it seems like they come off the club.  But all in all, I think we're all kind of in the same boat.  We're all guessing a little bit.  But you try to do the math and add or take off a certain amount of numbers.  But, yeah, it definitely is a little bit of a difference.
Q. How about the aggressive tendency in it with a format like this?
GRAHAM DELAET: That's the fun part.  I think that's why this is kind of a unique event.  Because really you can make two bogeys for every birdie you make and still be at even.  You take on a lot more than you probably would in a regular tournament.  It's just fun to play something different.
