 Q.  Just talking about the heat, Graham.  You're probably glad to have this one under your belt and be moving on.  Going to get a little steamy in the afternoon.  
GRAHAM DELAET: Last few holes are starting to get hot when the sun popped out.  I'm happy to be done, happy to have a good opening round.   
 Q.  What about the front side then, 2, 3, 4, 5, you had a great roll going.  
GRAHAM DELAET: I made some really good putts.  I wasn't hitting great shots.  Made a couple 30-footers, and then on 6 I had a really good chance to hit a birdie.  Hit a good putt from 12, 15 feet, missed that.  Played well really all day.  Kind of solid.  Didn't make any mistakes.  Made a couple good par saves.  That's what you got to do to keep the momentum going.   
 Q.  Talk about saving par, you had some scrambling opportunities here.  You made the most of them.  You got yourself in a little bit of a jam around some of the greens.  Found a way to work out of it.  
GRAHAM DELAET: Other than my only bogey today was on 14 the par-3.  I hit a pretty marginal, bunker shot.  Other than that, I did good to give myself chances at par or tap-in par, and hopefully I can keep doing that for another three days, and it's still early but a good start.   
 Q.  How does a guy like you up North, little chilly up there, come down to the sauna and perform well?  
GRAHAM DELAET: This is tough for me, actually.  There's some tournaments that I don't particularly enjoy because of the heat, but this is always -- this is kind of my break on my rookie year, I love this golf course.  The greens are always as good as they get on Tour.  I always enjoy coming here.
