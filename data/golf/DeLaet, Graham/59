Q.   Tight match; how difficult does it make it because you know there's a lot of pressure right now? 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it's very stressful out there.   Strick and Jordan played great, and myself and Graham also played great.   We gave ourselves a lot of opportunities on the greens, and, oh, man, this guy is clutch on 16 again.   Just to stick it in there close like he did, we needed that one, and then to hit my 7â€‘iron close on 18 was just a good shot. 

Q.   Now you get to turn it around and perhaps avenging the one blemish on the record so far this week, you get Mickelson and Bradley; Phil thought perhaps it might provide you some motivation. 
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, they definitely took it to us the other day.   They played tremendous golf, and like Jay said, we are both playing well here today and we are looking forward to this foursomes match. 

Q.   Tough match, well played today.   Your thoughts on what was a very, very tighten counter? 
GRAHAM DeLAET:   It was a very satisfying win for sure.   Jay played so good the middle holes, 10,11, 12, 13, 14.   I was kind of missing some shots there but we close it off, and it was like I said, super satisfying and we were looking forward to the afternoon match. 

Q.   Mickelson and Bradley, your quick thoughts on that? 
JASON DAY:   Very explosive team.   We hit a bus the last time we played them.   We just have to go out there and keep giving ourselves opportunities.   I know if we just chip away at it, hopefully it will be a close match and we can make it exciting.
