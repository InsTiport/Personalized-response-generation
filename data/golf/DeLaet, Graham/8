 Q.  I thought you showed great guts after 7 and 8?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I was proud of myself.  I had a lot of good chances coming down the stretch.  Obviously it's not what I wanted but I'm pretty proud of myself.   
 Q.  You have to sort of find yourself in that moment and I think you were able to steel yourself.  Did you feel that ability?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I hit a great tee shot on 9.  A perfect wedge and made a great putt.  That was a tough birdie today, straight downwind and got right back out.   
And on 10 that was probably the best shot I hit all day and caught the tree and fell down in the rough.  That was disappointing, because I was starting to get some momentum back again.  But it's still a good week.  I'm happy.  But not as happy as I'd like to do.   
 Q.  What will you try to take away from it?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: I think I did exactly what I set out to do today and that was stay calm and stay in the moment and I did that.  And it was the execution that wasn't there.  But emotionally and everything I think I did a pretty good job.   
 Q.  What do you take away from a tournament where it's basically one swing that keeps you out of a playoff?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: I don't think about it like that, that's what I'm saying.  This is a career, and this is one week of a year that's hopefully a long career for me.  This is a small bump in the road.  But I've played well, and I'm happy about it.
