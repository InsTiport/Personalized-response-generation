Q. What do you take away from today?
GRAHAM DELAET: Obviously you can't be in contention putting the way that I did today.  It's disappointing.  I was actually pretty proud of myself.  I hit the ball really well.  I kept trying all day long, I mean I just kept telling myself it was going to happen, it was going to happen.  Never did, but, you know, I'm proud of the effort that I put in.  Didn't happen today.
Babe Ruth and call my shot or anything like that, predict anything.  I needed to believe in myself.  I felt like too many times I've just kind of let what everything else playing and I wanted to take control.  Obviously I didn't take it but I'll be back again.
Q. Graham, thank so much for your time.
