 Q.   2‑over par today, talk about your round overall.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   Yeah, I hit a bad tee shot on both 2 and 3 and just got behind the 8‑ball.   I battled hard.   I was making a lot of pars which you had to do but I just got too far behind really.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions of the golf course and the weather and how that affected you.   
GRAHAM DeLAET:   It was tough.   It was toughest test since probably the U.S. Open last year that I can remember.   I mean, the scores are almost like U.S. Open.   
We made the turn straight into the wind there on 12, 13, 14, 15, and then we turned back down 17 and the wind stopped and we had the par 5 downwind.   So that was kind of disappointing.   But I felt like I grinded hard.   Like I said, I just got off to a bad start.
