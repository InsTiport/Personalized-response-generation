Q. Talk about today.GRAHAM DeLAET: It was kind of the story of the week.  It was just super disappointing.  I can't finish rounds right now.  I don't know what the heck is going on.  It's been two months of this and it's pretty frustrating.Q. Yeah.GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I was playing hard.  I wasn't trying to hit it where I hit it off the tee, but I had hybrid in and I hit a hard drive, and if you're in that bunker up against the lip, it's impossible.  I hit it to -- all I could do was just get it out and I still had a tough third -- or fourth, I guess, and it's a double, and then, I mean, hit a fat wedge on 18 and then my lag putting was terrible all day.  Not a good day.Q. You said it's been a month, but can you think of another week where you hit the ball as well as you have this week?GRAHAM DeLAET: Last week and the week before and the week before that.Q. Phil hit it on the balcony on 17 today when he was 10-under.GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I know I'm hitting the ball well, but I've got to figure out how to get the ball in the hole.  That's the bottom line.  My short game was absolutely terrible all week, and I've got to figure it out.Q. How do you do that?GRAHAM DeLAET: Practise.  I haven't had the time to practise.  Next week it's going to be -- obviously it's a short week.  You know, it's tough right now because it's so fresh, I just got off 18.  I know I'm hitting the ball well and I'm playing well, but you can't score unless you can get it done around the greens.
