 Q.  How would you assess your week here at the RBC Canadian Open?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, you can't get much done out here shooting par on the weekend.  It was pretty mediocre golf to say the least on Saturday, Sunday.  But it was fun.  We'll be back again next year and hopefully somebody can get it done.   
 Q.  Another event next week, Barracuda.  Tell us how you prepare for that.  
GRAHAM DeLAET: It's a fun event.  It's the Stableford system and rewards aggressive play.  You can take a few more things on.  We rented a house in Tahoe for the week, so it should be a good event.   
 Q.  You joked earlier yesterday that it's nice to have a crowd following you, you haven't had a crowd following you like this before.  Sum up what it's like to have that many people cheering for you know matter how you finished this weekend.  
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, it's fun.  The support we get as Canadians in this golf tournament is obviously great.  But you want to be able to give them something to cheer about, and I wasn't really able to do that this weekend but hopefully next year.
