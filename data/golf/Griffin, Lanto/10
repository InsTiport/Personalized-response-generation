 Q.  Nice playing. If we can get some comments on your day.  
LANTO GRIFFIN: All right. Go through the round? Yeah, got off to a -- yesterday I putted really well. Today I wanted to be a little bit more clean off the tee. So I got off to a good start. I had two really good up and downs on the front and three birdies, a clean card.   
Then the back nine I hit a few wayward shots and one mistake on 12 and made bogey.   
Other than that, putts didn't fall on the back. I felt good. Actually felt better over the ball today than I did yesterday even though the score didn't reflect it.   
Putter still feels really good, so looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  Putting is going to be a big key going into the weekend. Are there any adjustments you'll make going into Saturday and Sunday?  
LANTO GRIFFIN: Same thing. No, I've been putting really well. I had three or four on the back nine that couldn't dropped and they didn't. But it's tough. They got the pins tuck out here. Obviously it's playing fairly easy, but you can't really short-side yourself. There are a lot of the silly bogeys out there. Like on 18, the pin is four from the edge.   
It's one of those courses where even if you have a wedge it's hard to really fire right at it. You have a lot of those 10- to 20-footers for birdie. Those are the key out here, is just kind of rolling those in.   
 Q.  Yesterday was warm and sunny; today cooler and overcast. How did the course play differently?  
LANTO GRIFFIN: Surprised it actually played somewhat firmer. The greens are firming up, the fairways were firming up, and the course is playing great. The greens are perfect. They're fast. The weather is obviously really good, but the wind does swirl. I think three or four times today it did about a 180 shift on us out of nowhere from when one guys hits to the next guy.   
Kind of expect that down in the valley with mountains on both sides, so...   
But te course is great. Fits my eye. Haven't heard a bad word about it. Yeah, Greenbrier is awesome.   
 Q.  Your a Blacksburg guy.  
LANTO GRIFFIN: I am.   
 Q.  Is it almost like a home feel to you, close to home?  
LANTO GRIFFIN: Yeah, I grew up about an hour and a half away. Feels like I have half the gallery out here on my side. It's fun. There is some added pressure, but it's good pressure. The type that kind of focuses you up and makes you want to play well in front of the home crowd.   
It didn't have a negative effect on me, which it's good. It's fun having my whole family and girlfriend as family and my niece and nephew out here. My niece wouldn't give me a bite of her cookie when I finished, so... I don't think it would've mattered if I shot 60 or 80, she still wouldn't have given me a bite, but...   
 Q.  That was a good up on 18. That deserved a cookie.  
LANTO GRIFFIN: I know. She wouldn't give me a bite, and she's in player dining, getting it from player dining. I'll have to talk to her after the round.   
 Q.  You have to find out where those cookies are.  
LANTO GRIFFIN: I'm going to go get one right now.   
 Q.  You got the afternoon off. What are you doing?  
LANTO GRIFFIN: I'm going to go probably hit about 15, 20 minutes, get tempo and rhythm back and maybe hit a couple chips. I'm staying up at a cabin about 40 minutes away. We're going to go maybe do some target practice and cook some pizzas on the outdoor pizza oven. I got about 15, 18 people up there, so I will have plenty of distractions. I won't be thinking about golf, which is great.
