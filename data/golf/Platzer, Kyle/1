THE MODERATOR: Thanks for joining us today and supporting professional women's golf and the LPGA.  Can you give your name and team?
DENNIS WIDEMAN: My name is Dennis Wideman, and I'm with Calgary.
KYLE PLATZER: My name is Kyle Platzer, and I'm with the Edmonton Oilers.
TANNER PEARSON: My name is Tanner Pearson, and I'm with the Los Angeles Kings.
MIKE HOFFMAN: Mike Hoffman with the Ottawa Senators.
Q. Can you speak to the significance of having a professional sporting event like this week's Manulife LPGA Classic in the region?
KYLE PLATZER: It's a great golf course to have an event at.  It's fun to watch these girls go out and post good numbers.
MIKE HOFFMAN: For myself, I mean, I've never played with a professional golfer.  So be pretty cool to see how they hit the ball, and their approaches and putting and whatnot.  So I think that's the biggest thing.
Q. Did you all practice in preparation for today's game?  Be honest here.
DENNIS WIDEMAN: I've played four rounds in the last three months.  So, no, I didn't practice.  I have two young kids, so I don't get to play much.
KYLE PLATZER: I played a ton this year, but not recently in the last month or so.  Hopefully my "A" game comes out today.
TANNER PEARSON: Yeah, we're all members of the same course, so us three golf quite a bit together throughout the summer.
MIKE HOFFMAN: I play quite a bit in the afternoons, usually three or four times a week, so there should be no complaints.
Q. What are you looking forward to today, as you play in the Pro-Am?
MIKE HOFFMAN: We're here to win.  We're not here to sip tea.
Q. (Inaudible)?
DENNIS WIDEMAN: I usually try to follow it as much as I can.  This year they had a great year again, and they did win the Cup the year after I left there.  Yeah, I follow them, I still keep in contact here and there when I can.  I'm obviously pretty proud of the Knights and what they have been able to do over the last decade.  So it's exciting to see them winning again.
Q. (Inaudible)?
DENNIS WIDEMAN: I think it's huge.  I think when you are just a young kid like that and you are just learning the game and learning the ins and outs of how to play, I think they do a great job there of getting you ready for the pro life.  It's a hundred times different from junior to making that transition into pro.  I think having those guys there that have done it for a long time, have been around the game for a long time, really get the players ready to turn pro.  I think that goes with the amount of players that are coming out of their system.  When they do come to the NHL, they seem a lot more ready.
Q. (Inaudible)?
TANNER PEARSON: No.  I have surfed, yes.
Q. (Inaudible)?
TANNER PEARSON: I live on the beach, so it could come in handy.
