   RHONDA GLENN: Carolyn, why don't you just sum up your week for us here, first. How do you feel about today?
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Well, I played great all week until the eighth hole today, and so I feel good about the week. 
 Any time you get in the finals, it's an honor and it's a privilege. And you work hard to get there, and you hate to lose, but you're there. And you're the only other person that has a chance, so that's worth something.
 RHONDA GLENN: You were playing in memory of one of your dear friends today. Just briefly tell that story.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Toni Wiesner has been a friend for over 30 years, and she passed away this July of cancer, and fought the hard battle and loved golf and was quite the competitor. And we all looked up to her, and modeled ourselves after her, and you know, I'd rather her be here and me not be in the finals. How about that? 
 RHONDA GLENN: And a blue ribbon.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Was given to everyone at the State Amateur. She died the day we qualified for the State Amateur, and one of our friends had made all the ribbons, and we put them on our hats. So I still got mine on.
 RHONDA GLENN: And you were the last one standing with the blue ribbon on. That's quite something. Toni Wiesner was the runner-up last year. 
 Carolyn, you were 1-up going into the eighth hole, and 130-yard par-3, you hit it in the bunker. What happened on that shot, the tee shot? 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Well, I think the same thing happened on that shot that happened on the rest of the bad shots. I got my body out in front of myself, and it causes it to go short right. And it didn't occur to me until too late.
 RHONDA GLENN: I know. It looked like you kind of lost your hand speed.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Well, my body just, yeah, the body gets fast or the hand. I don't know what happened.
 RHONDA GLENN: And the thing on the eighth hole then, Sherry Herman, her putt well passed the hole. So it wasn't a sure thing. 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Well, my ball was buried in the bunker. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Was it buried? And then you hit your ball and over the green and had to chip back, so it was a double, a 5 to Sherry's 4, match is on all square. Then on 10 she had a nice birdie, but you had par. So she went 1-up. 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: And I made a slew of bogeys. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Yeah. 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: But I just started hitting it bad. There's nothing -- she didn't -- she hit it well. She made pars, and I hit it poorly, and didn't. And my putting was less than exceptional today. 
 RHONDA GLENN: You drove the ball very well, I thought. I mean you were hitting the fairways.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Yeah. Pretty good.
 RHONDA GLENN: Good distance, but it was your approach shots, you would say, your iron shots? 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Yeah. And not making my putts. Left two hanging, and one, I don't know. That one.
 RHONDA GLENN: Which one are you talking about? 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: 11. Out of the bunker. I hit a pretty good shot out of the bunker, and then I had about a 6-footer to win the hole, and it went up and looked in and rolled the other way. I don't know how that happened. Anyway, so three putts that hung on the lip. 
 RHONDA GLENN: That would have made the difference.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Would have made a difference. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Sure. Okay. What about for you now? Are you going to play the Women's Mid Amateur? 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Yeah. The Southern Seniors is next week. The Mid Am is the next week. Well, it's in a couple weeks, and then the twin matches are the next week.
 RHONDA GLENN: Senior Women's Amateur --
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Invitational matches. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Senior Women's Invitational matches. Where are those played this year? 
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Crooked Stick. 
 RHONDA GLENN: Oh, good. All right. All right, Carolyn. Thanks so much. You've been so gracious to us all week.
 CAROLYN CREEKMORE: Oh, I've had a blast, until just about the last two hours.
