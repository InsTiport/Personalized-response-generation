 Q.  Just comment on your round.  Tough conditions out there.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I got off to a really nice start which helped, knowing that the conditions were blowing in, trying to take advantage of the front nine.  And then once they started to come in there, it was just try and hold on for dear life and felt like I played well to just make all pars there.   
 Q.  And just thoughts on coming back tomorrow morning and what tomorrow will hold.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I think we had the option to finish out the hole, but we weren't on No. 9, so it wasn't going to do us much good.  So I've got a shot from the fairway on 8, and then the 9th hole trying to make two pars there, and then go on to Pebble and kind of see what the day gives you.  I'm not sure what the forecast is.
