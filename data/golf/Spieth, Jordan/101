 Q.  Jordan, are you satisfied as you walked off this golf course today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No, I felt like I played better than 1-under, but it's getting better.  I mean, I feel like all parts of the game are where they need to be to be able to compete in the tournament.   
Just a couple kind of sloppy wedges on the back nine, or else, you know, could have been 3- or 4-under, only one back, but going out tomorrow, early conditions, try and get out there and post a number, 4- or 5-under, stay in this tournament.   
 Q.  We talked yesterday you're very enthusiastic where your game is right now.  Is the only validation for your hard work a high finish or a win?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Not at all.  Actually quite the opposite.  I don't need a high finish or a win.  It's more kind of just the way I feel out there.  I know when the game's there and whether it's a high finish or a win, if I'm progressing the right direction, I know historically that's where it leads.   
So I'm not in any rush.  I'm just trying to stay patient with it all.  1-under in a first round is a really good score for me on Thursdays this year.  I actually should be pretty happy about that.  I've been over par most of my first rounds and then climbing back from there.  So on a difficult golf course, if I continue to hit fairways like I did today, you can shoot 4- or 5-under.
