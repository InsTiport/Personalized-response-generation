 Q.  Seemed like you built some momentum early in the back nine, and then the bogey at 5 kind of halted things.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I really only had two bad swings today.  I'm hitting the ball great, which is what I've really been working on the past couple weeks, trying to get more consistent and better ball-striking, better control of it.  I'm hitting it -- I feel as comfortable over the ball and driving it the best I've driven it the whole year, hitting it great, just distance control and then my speed control with the putter, which are things that sometimes take a round or two to get back.   
 Q.  It looked like you really liked your approach shot at 6 and at the end it kind of trickled off.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, we thought -- we played 75, 80 percent of the holes into the wind today.  It was flipping back and forth, and almost every tee shot was into the breeze, and I got up and I even played that one -- my tee shot on that hole was into the wind, and then I played my next shot to be downwind and I still hit it over, so stuff like that with flipping winds.  Still hit solid shots that just caught the wrong gusts, but that happens.  I can't make that many mistakes when it does happen.   
 Q.  You looked like you were frustrated with the putter, pushing some of them to the right a little bit.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it'll come around.  It's something that I'm trying to trust right now, and it feels like I'm going to hit it left when it's actually hitting it on line.  But it's something that -- it's actually the same feeling I had at Augusta, and it worked fine there, so it shouldn't be a problem.  I just need to trust it.   
 Q.  Can you kind of explain to us what happened on 9?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I hit it seven times.  Yeah, just -- I hit two fantastic shots, and then not really sure after that.
