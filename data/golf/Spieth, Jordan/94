JORDAN SPIETH: Really did a great job of staying patient, and turned it into and under-par round.   
 Q.  Tiger is 7-under through 10.  Does it feel like you missed the cut like 20 when you're playing next to him?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Anybody that's tearing it up and they're 5, 6-under the 1st Round, it's not going to be -- you're sitting there, it's an easy golf course.  The second you try and force something here into these pins you end up making bogies.  You don't force anything, there's not a whole lot of bogies out there.   
You play the par-3s the right way and play to the fat parts when you're out of position you should make pars.  So, I thought I did a really good job kind of just talking to myself, being patient, not getting upset with the fact that you hear roars everywhere and obviously with Tiger and Rickie both playing well.  I thought today was a really, really good test for me mentally and I did a good job finishing up.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, 5 that was a horrible swing.  It was a phenomenal up and down.  That one certainly propelled the finish throughout.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Not really.  You just kind of hope that -- kind of hope that you're making putts before he does because after he makes the putts a lot of times there's a lot of movement going on.   
But, no, for me it was -- again, just like I told Doug, it's anybody lying about that, you obviously realize it's happening but stay focused on your own game.   
The toughest part is when there's that many birdies within the group, him and Rickie, it's tough not to force it when I was out of position all day.  So, I thought my 3-under was fantastic from places I played today.   
 Q.  You looked frustrated early on.  How do you get over that mentally?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I was frustrated off the tee because I struggled this year a lot with alignment issues.  I did a good job last week of staying committed to my lines and really know where they were and the last couple of days and today they just got off.   
I kind of changed the swing feel out there that had me start the ball closer to the right line.  I was able to hit fairways the last five, six holes.  I just was frustrated because I know that when you hit the fairway you get these really good opportunities to make birdie, and, if you don't, you're essentially playing for par.  Off the tee right when I strike the ball and I look up it's like, man, I'm either in the hole or out of the hole.   
 Q.  Probably not the right person to ask, is this course a good test?  Does it test you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I think it does because of the severity of the greens.  It's almost like the way I thought about it coming in, it's almost like Trinity Forest in the sense the greens are big, the fairways are wider, it's not overly long so if you play -- you just have the right mindset going in like smart golf when you're out of position, you're not going to make many bogies.  But in order to make birdies you really do have to feed it in or make big breaking putts.   
I think it's a fun test.  I think it would be even better if the fairways were narrower obviously, and it's firmer.  That's kind of weather-dependent, which there's not a whole lot you can do.   
 Q.  Did Tiger changes shirts today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't think Tiger changed shirts today.  I know that's been a common theme for him, more shirts for round.   
 Q.  He did.  After the range.  
JORDAN SPIETH: I didn't know.  Yeah, it's hot but I thought Monday was really hot last week.  I thought yesterday was pretty hot.  Today, it was okay.  Nothing I'm not used to practicing in this time of year in Dallas.  I don't mind it.  Problem is the crowds block the wind.  When you're playing with Tiger, you get the bigger crowds, they block the wind on the tee.  The tee boxes were so hot.   
 Q.  When is the last time you made a birdie putt and nobody cheered?  
JORDAN SPIETH: That was weird, right, all three of us.  Wait until you grab it out of the hole.  That happens, that happens.   
I'm trying -- 12 at Augusta was really delayed and they obviously see it go in but it's like a good three seconds after it goes in you hear the roar.  That's the only one I could think of that's kind of like that.  Kind of weird.
