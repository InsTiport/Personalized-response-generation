Q. How do you assess your play at the end of the day?
JORDAN SPIETH: I did a lot of things really well today. And there was just a lid on the hole. I might have had five plus lip‑outs, and I didn't adjust to the speed dropping down a couple of feet on the Stimpmeter. But all in all I felt like I played a 4‑ or 5‑under round, something to stay in this tournament. And got just kind of unfortunate on some of the looks.

Q. 2 and 3 you had about 12 footers, if you made one of those, might you have gotten something going?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, one went to the right, one went to the left. They were just great putts that were the right speed and pace. I mean it was just really, really close and just a little off. I don't know if it would have made a difference in the rest of the round, but I wouldn't have felt as rushed at that point, when you know it's a very scorable golf course. 

Q. You were on the back, did you kind of have an idea who the big roar might have been for?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, there was at least a few of them. And then I wasn't looking at the board to start, I kind of told myself I wouldn't, and then once I was at a certain point in the back nine, trying to figure out what the course was giving everybody else you kind of need to. And we could hear them right behind us, they were for Rory, most of them. And then Patrick's was the big one for the eagle on 13 and 15. 
So, yeah, I mean there was a lot of roars all the time at Augusta on the weekend. It's pretty cool. You can normally tell if‑‑ last year, second to the last group, I could tell the eagle roar is different from a birdie roar which is different from the par save roar. The octaves, you kind of understand what the score was.

Q. But you're trying to focus on what you're doing, are you wondering who did what?
JORDAN SPIETH: Patrick's roar ‑‑ the birdie roar for Rory, right there‑‑ Patrick's roar on 15 was while I was over putt on 17. But you just‑‑ it's not like it really would have made a difference. I knew that whatever it was for, it wasn't making a difference in probably the outcome of the tournament for me. You're over putts sometimes, sometimes you're just walking down the fairways. Either way it's unique and cool about this place.

Q. Your back nine numbers are about as good as anybody's, 3‑over on the front, do you feel you haven't got it going on the front?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, my poor start yesterday I didn't think could really determine the outcome of the tournament for me. But given where the scores went yesterday afternoon that was huge. 3‑over through those first three holes yesterday when they were playing right at 1‑under for the average for the field, that's four shots I've given back on just yesterday's start. 
Again, today I did everything I felt I could do. I had a lot of really good chances. And it just wouldn't go in for me. And that happens sometimes. 
So I'm not down. I get to go out for one of my only stress‑free rounds that I've ever really played at Augusta National tomorrow and enjoy the walk, whether it's with DJ or Justin. Either way, two good buddies I could be paired with. And then we'll go try and do what some of those guys did out in front today, shoot 7‑ or 8‑under.

Q. What do you make of what Reed is doing, separating himself out there?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, two eagles. Patrick is somebody who isn't afraid of challenges, obviously, as we've seen in the past. It's been kind of a major championship hump that he's had to get over and play the way that he knows how to play. So I'm not surprised. It was kind of a matter of time, I thought. And he's been progressing nicely and gaining confidence every week.

Q. (No microphone.)
JORDAN SPIETH: Patrick? Yeah, I think that‑‑ yeah, I'm sure you can draw back on any success in majors. Okay, that was just like another tournament. It's just hyped up ahead of time. And I think he's come in with the mentality that he's fully capable of winning here, and he's proving what he is capable of doing here. It's going to be a pretty cool showdown with Rory tomorrow, maybe with a couple back now.
