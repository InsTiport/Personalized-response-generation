 Q.     Jordan, nice round there, the last.   What a great back-9 that was to really get some things going.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, sure.   Played the first seven holes really well.   Had a lot of good chances and just misreads here, just didn't quite match the line and speed.   So, stayed really patient, though.   Could have made a mistake there on 8, trying to be too aggressive.   Went ahead and hit it to the middle of the green, 2-putt for birdie.   The back-9 gave a few more.   The wind died down, and with the greens being soft, if we were playing out of the fairway, you could really fire at some flag sticks.  
   
 Q.   Everybody was hitting greens today.   How did you find a way to start making putts?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Well, the greens are rolling nicely, but I also started giving myself a little shorter putts.   Instead of 30, 40-footers, I was hitting it in there in makeable range.   That certainly helped.   Once you see a couple go in the hole, starts to look bigger.  
   
 Q.   They say the winds are going to shift.   Anything you think maybe a key as the winds shifts north, northeast?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   The harder holes are going to become even harder.   Holes like 15.   Holes like 5 and 6, and look at the last three, 16, 17 -- 15 through 18 are all going to be what looks like into left to right wind.   That makes those holes really hard with water on the left.   Really driving the ball in the fairway on those holes is going to be extremely key.  
   
 Q.   Jordan, Tiger didn't play last year when you played.   Are you eager to see what it's like with Tiger at Augusta and the roars?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   He's playing?   I'm sure that -- I'm sure that wasn't talked about at all.   Yeah.   Was he not there last year?  
   
 Q.   No, he had back surgery.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Okay.  
   
 Q.   You crushed so many people.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   I've been paired with him in like San Diego where you get big crowds.   Augusta obviously there's going to be roars and everyone is going to really want him to get off to a good start and do whatever they can to try and give him some momentum from the crowd.   So, if he gets a couple birdies early, I'm sure it will be really, really loud out there.
