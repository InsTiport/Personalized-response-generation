JORDAN SPIETH: This is the best I've felt in quite a while.  I'm very happy.
It's the same reason the last five or six years, my best finishes are in the majors.  We pick a plan to peak for the majors.  It's very difficult to try and to do that every week because you use a lot of energy up.  The next couple days, I can't really, I mean, I don't feel like I can do anything.  I've got to just rest and recover.  But you do everything to try and peak for these tournaments and you put in extra time and hours, and just stuff that would be almost impossible to do week-in and week-out, and fortunately, what we do is correct.
My score in majors typically reflects the state of my game at that time and I've been speaking to how it's been closer and better than maybe results would show, and I felt like it is about -- it feels about how I finish this week.
I knew coming into the week that it was unlikely on this golf course that I was going to have a chance to win, and that's a humbling feeling for me, but I knew that if I played the course the right way, had the right mentality, kept putting the way I've been putting, that I would be in it; that I would be, you know, in and having a chance to make some noise.
Q. Do you feel like you overachieved this week?
JORDAN SPIETH: No.  I don't feel like I overachieved.  I felt like I made progress from where I was last week and I felt like -- and I feel like I can go to a course next week that I've had success at, and is a way better fit for me I think than Bethpage.  Bethpage, just when the rough is up this high, obviously I can't pick a course that's probably further away from it being for me.
Having said that, and still feeling like I have work to do, I'm in a good place.
When you get from 11 tee box today -- it went from being one of the easiest holes on Thursday to maybe the hardest hole on the course today, and then it just doesn't get any easier.  You have a 600-yard par 5 straight into a 20-mile-an-hour wind trying to hit two shots in the fairway and another one to get up.  Just the entire golf course from 11 in today is playing as hard as any course that we'll see even at any U.S. Open I can remember as a closing stretch.  It's just tough.  I mean, it's just, for DJ to be at -- I think he's at 2-under now and for him to have been at 3-under through 15 holes, has got to be the score of the day through 15 holes.  I think there's maybe a couple under shot early in the day.  But that's like shooting 8- or 9-under on -- through 14 on a given week.
If someone were to do that from that 5-under and it's DJ, then it's not totally out of the ordinary for it to get closer.
Q. How Brooks has been playing --
JORDAN SPIETH: I think it was probably, I don't know, four shots harder today.  Just looking at scoring average, that will probably tell you.  Yeah, probably around there.
Q. What does this say to you about this performance --
JORDAN SPIETH: It says that I have full belief in our team.  I have full belief in my process, my mentality, my selfishness and my work ethic.  I put in more hours over the last five months than I've ever put in my game in a five-month stretch, just trying to get to where I can be out here on a major championship Sunday making par saves, making birdie putts, and contending even without having my best stuff.  That's like 2015, 2016, 2017, that's how I felt then.
Q. Do you have to change your attitude --
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't know if I have to change my attitude and I have been speaking to this.  I've just been waiting patiently for this work to continue to get better but it's very positive going forward, yes.
