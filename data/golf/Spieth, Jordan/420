Q.   Six birdies today.   The bad news, you finished with a bogey.   But other good news is that the last six winners have come from behind.   How do you feel about your day?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I'm going to need a special round, I believe, and hit the ball and putt better than I have any of the rounds this week.   So trending in the right direction, things are getting closer and closer.   My putting inside 10 feet isn't quite there but I'm making some ones that are unexpected.   So it's an interesting type of week.   Hopefully tomorrow we can get out and get off to a hot start put a little pressure on them.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, sure.   No. 1 was nice to have a good look for eagle and a short putt on 2, that kind of same start would be ideal.

Q.   Jordan, just about 35, 40 minute drive to home, a little bit extra time.   What are you going to do tonight to get ready for tomorrow?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Going to go hit some putts, just kind of lay low, get off my feet this afternoon and try to eat a good meal.   It's nice to be in contention on such an incredible golf course, one that there are low scores out here, they just haven't really been shot, so hopefully tomorrow brings them.

Q.   Jordan, I thought it was a little bit of a strange round, you make some bombs at 8 and 9 and then there were a couple 10-footers that I had marked down as birdies on my card that just kind of slid by the cup.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, you know, the ones on 8 and 9 were unexpected.   No. 2 was a five-footer that I thought I could rock in and missed it.   But just the mistakes, I've got to limit the mistakes.   I just didn't have enough really good looks today.   There were putts from 18 feet felt like they were eight feet, maybe I make two or three more.   Still grabbed six birdies so it's good news going into the tomorrow though.   I didn't really have the best stuff, still made six birdies.   I've just got to figure out how to play No. 5 and we'll go from there.

Q.   We could have predicted that ball on the left-hand side, you weren't going to miss over on the right.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   Tomorrow I think I'm just going to take out driver and say screw it, hit it over the tree.

Q.   Two good things, you're in the house, you're under par and you beat the rain. 
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, yeah, that's nice.   I'm going to get some work in before it starts raining here on the green and see if I can't find something in my putting for tomorrow.

Q.   That was actually three good things.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I can't count, either.

Q.   Jordan, you're done, you're dry and you're in (inaudible.)   What do you think?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I mean, I've been minus 8 at one point in this tournament so it's tough to come up here after a round not being at least there.   But had some chances today.   It was kind of a really weird round.   I got off to a good start the first three or four holes there and then had a couple looks that I thought were going in and made a couple bombs.   So it was interesting, it was interesting.   Making three bogeys a round isn't really going to cut it out here having, I think it is now eight or nine over-par holes in the tournament.   Making enough birdies to win, I just have to limit those mistakes.   I've got to be able to make those par saves.

Q.   (Inaudible)
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, my matching the speed and line is really close and so some of these longer putts, they're dropping; some of the shorter putts, some are dropping, some are missing.   Yeah, it's odd, it's odd.   I feel almost more comfortable with the 25-footer than I do an eight-footer right now.   I put a lot of work in, I just need to put some more, get adjusted to the greens.   They've certainly changed with the weather being a little softer, maybe a little bit slower, and maybe I haven't made that adjustment because some of the -- most of the ones that I'm missing that are shorter length I'm missing low.   So just not quite hitting them firm enough and having confidence in the next one.

Q.   How's the course holding up with all the rain?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I mean, it's amazing.   The first round we actually could have played the ball up, we didn't -- I mean played the ball down.   Yeah, with the amount of rain that we've been getting in the Metroplex, it's incredible that we can play a tournament let alone have it not affect the scores and to really make this still a challenging venue.   Obviously there's a premium on putting the ball in the fairway because then you can throw a dart in.   But all in all the greens are still quick and they're not too soft or getting spiked up.   They're putting nicely.

Q.   Did you have a number in mind today?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, if I struck the ball well and with these conditions, I started out driving the ball extremely well, and if that were the case I feel like I could shoot 6-, 7-under out here and that would have moved me back up I felt like within one or two.   I had a really good look at it.   I knew I needed probably 10-under for the two rounds to have a chance to get to 13-under.   I think that still could possibly be the number.   Obviously shooting seven tomorrow isn't ideal, I would have liked to have grabbed a few more today.   But all in all I just want to -- I just want to find the fairway tomorrow, get off to a good start and just kind of get in the flow of the round.   I got a little anxious on a couple holes today.   I don't have to shoot 7-under and it's tough for me to ever -- when I'm this far back, it's tough to not press because I just want to get to the lead so quickly, you know, by the end of the round.   Normally I can get away with it.   On this golf course you can't, you can't get away with trying to press.   Even like the layup shot on 11, I ended up birdieing the hole today but I hit a really dumb shot there trying to push up to a certain number versus hitting my stock shot that's going to be in the fairway and I'm going to have a gap wedge in versus trying to get up to a lob wedge.   I got lucky I had a good lie and actually made birdie, but that kind of stuff, and pushing it off the tees that I don't get away with on this course and that's what's prevented me from winning the last couple years, so I'm going to try to make adjustments for tomorrow.

Q.   Three birdies in a four-hole span, what do you take with you moving forward?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I mean, they're out there, just need the looks.   The holes started to look bigger and bigger at that time.   And then 12 I have a wedge in my hand in the middle of the fairway and make bogey, just stuff like that.   The hole's already starting to look bigger, I've just got to give myself a putt; play the ball 15 feet left of the hole instead of going right at the pin and I'm going to make it.   I have that kind of confidence at that moment in time and then you just kind of -- it gets kind of shot when I hit it in the short-sided bunker, chunk it out and have to chip it again.   It was tough, it was tough at that moment, but I'll learn from that.   If I can get in some kind of a stretch early tomorrow, I'll be able to pick a little more conservative targets, aggressive swings and have more putts.
