 Q. (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: Up and down, standing on the range, hitting into a 30-mile-an-hour wind, I was just kinda laughing to myself, saying, you make pars out here it's going to be an awesome day. 
 I stepped up and birdied 1 and 2, and it was like, all right, who knows what will happen, who says you can't shoot 5 or 6-under today. Then reality kinda kicked in, I caught a couple of bad breaks and within those bad breaks made a couple of amateur decisions. That definitely hurt, but I learned from 'em and I'm actually -- I'm in a good mood because I finished well on 17 and 18. 

 Q. How difficult was it out there? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: Extremely hard. I told my caddy every single hole make sure you're telling me to stay patient on every shot. I just needed to be reassured, just trying to settle down and make loose swings and think through each shot. The wind is so hard to sit there and think through where you're going to hit it and still make the best swing. 
 So I struggled. On four or five holes today I made four or five swings where I wasn't ready to hit it. And it cost me five shots. 
 But, you know, I'm happy today the ball is rolling on the greens and my putter is keeping me in this and helping me. Maybe one of these rounds I'll find a way to not make any bogeys. 

 Q. You're not going to your graduation? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: No, I don't think so, it's going to be too late.
