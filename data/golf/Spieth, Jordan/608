 Q.   Very impressive, considering your experience in that sort of position.   Did you know where you stood coming down the stretch?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, the scoreboards, it was kind of annoying, I was trying to look at it and every time I looked it wasn't the top scores.   But I asked Michael on 14 and he told me I was actually tied for the lead.   I thought I was a couple down.   And made a good save there.   Just unfortunately didn't get up‑and‑down on 15 or 16, but obviously I haven't been in that position very much.   
I was feeling the heat, and you know, hit good putts.   That was the biggest thing is my hands stayed good under pressure with the putter.   May fall one short here, but it was a great experience.  
   
 Q.   Now, you're going to get into Tampa next week.   How do your expectations change there?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   I feel ‑‑ I didn't think of this as any lesser tournament than any other PGA event.   So I'm going to go in with high expectations.   I've been playing well, and just try and do the same thing.
