 Q.  What was the difference Thursday to Friday?  
JORDAN SPIETH: On the greens, yeah.  Nice to get off to a good start, and I saw a couple putts go in early and normally that's all I need to kind of stop skiing uphill and start to turn downhill.  So, yeah, I got off to a great start, 5-under through nine and cruised a little on the back, that was more ball striking, but hit better putts today on greens -- when we teed off yesterday we were one of the first groups, today we were one of the last groups, so the greens on this poa annua were a little bit more beat up and it's a little tougher as you get later in the day.  So go in to tomorrow to Pebble and try and shoot a low number Saturday like last year.   
 Q.  Anything specific in your setup or anything that you've been working on with your putting that you did before today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, some minor adjustments just to get on top of the ball and see the line a little easier.   
 Q.  What's your biggest thought going into tomorrow?  What do you feel like you have to do to go low like you did a couple years ago?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It's going to be breezy, I think we're going to get winds from 10 to 15, maybe even more miles an hour, which could be advantageous on some holes out there at Pebble, but it's all about just giving myself enough opportunities.  I just did a good job on that front nine and I had eight out of nine really good looks at birdie and knocked five of them in.  So tomorrow in the wind, greens in regulation are going to be important.
