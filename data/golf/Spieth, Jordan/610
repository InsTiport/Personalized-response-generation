 Q. How was the day? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: It was good, first three holes today, I mean, I was shaking. You know, I thought I would be ready and I thought it would be a little easier, but, in fact, it wasn't and I lost a couple of shots just based off nerves that I think I can get back the next couple of days. 
 It's unbelievable, just practicing with these guys, seeing how good they are with their short game and how consistent they are, it's cool. 

 Q. Did that surprise you that you had to fight that early? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: A little bit. I thought I would be more prepared but I didn't get a lot of sleep last night I was so anxious to get off and unfortunately I had to wait until 1:45 today. It would have been nicer to get the first round off in the morning but I'm not a veteran out here complaining. I'm happy to be here, but you know, I was a little surprised that I was that nervous, especially when I hit my first tee shot, probably the best shot I hit all day besides 18, just right down the middle. 
 I thought, all right, cool, I'll get this on the green and get settled in. Just caught a couple in between yardages, so start and I'm just happy with the way I got the putt to fall and made a few more. 

 Q. What did you do to settle down? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: I made a birdie on 4. It was, you know, it was about a 10-footer and I just -- just like last year, just like any other tournament I play, once I can get one putt to fall then more can fall, but I think that birdie on 4 was really just huge for settling me down, and I think it's the reason I was able to shoot under par today. 

 Q. How about on 6, do you think you just -- (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, yeah, it was hauling when it went in. If that didn't go in I was going to have to make a 10-footer for bogey, I guess. I thank the golf Gods for that one. That was -- really, first three holes when I was walking to 4 green my caddy was like, all right, you've been back, here, you've been tentative, even if you have to rip it and it goes 3 feet, just go for it. 
 So I ripped one in on 5 and that nails the stick and goes in. So, you know, just trying to stay aggressive but that was a cool roll for the crowd, too.

 Q. 19, frustrated that you're scoring well but you're not playing well, is that right? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: I wasn't driving the ball well at all. My stroke felt the best it's probably ever felt. Starting putts right on my line and the reach is good at least to start and when I missed them, they were rolling right by the lip, I had a couple of lip-outs, but just, you know, I couldn't get myself in a good position. 
 The hardest holes out here, the key holes, like 12 and 14, you know, you can't miss either one of those right and I hit it way right and went over. Just kind of dumb mistakes I look back on, and I'm glad I fought through and was able to get a birdie coming in to make me happy now but lookin' back, hopefully I can take advantage of those holes tomorrow. 

 Q. Jordan, seemed like you were missing to the right down there, was that the problem? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: Well, yeah, I think I was kind of aiming there, I just -- my natural swing I normally see those things draw but right now I'm hitting a straight stock with the shot, which is a good ball to have with balls not moving, I've just got to play it. I'm not quite used to but the more shots I hit on the range and on the course the better it will get. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: You know, over the ball I felt okay, just the thing was my mind was not in a right spot to start. Number 1 I was in between clubs and I was thinking just don't hit it in the left bunker instead of, put this to 10 feet. Like I started to think the rest of the round. Just mentally I just wasn't quite ready to handle the nerves today and it cost me at the beginning, but I'm glad I'm in the position I'm in going off early tomorrow before the 30-mile-an-hour wind picks up. 

 Q. Will you sleep better tonight? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: I think I will, definitely, considering I'm about to pass out right here and fall asleep. (Laughter.)

 Q. Seemed like the round was long. 
 JORDAN SPIETH: It was, like, six hours, one of the longer rounds I've played in a while, plus the fact that I -- I went to the basketball game last night, so I didn't get back until late and my heart was beatin' so fast, I was so happy for the Mavericks game that I couldn't get to sleep. 
 I got a feeling I'm going to hit the hay early tonight.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: I don't think a lot of it because the course dried out actually a lot. It really wasn't -- the greens, for all the hail, they were in awesome shape. Marks at the end of the day just like any other course, spike marks stickin' out but I don't know why it was that slow, it was perfect otherwise, but I'm glad I'm going off early tomorrow. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: We've known etch ear for a long time and we're going to be roommates next year. We've played together in tournaments recently, and he's as intense as I am out there, as competitive, and times today where I was having a good time, saying hi to my friends, he would bring me back and get me focused, and that's why I chose him to caddy for me this week, and he did a great job today. 
 He stayed extremely positive when I got kind of down to start. Once I made that putt on 4, he was more pumped up than I was because he knew that it would help me settle down. 

 Q. Vijay Singh came through earlier but you had bigger galleries than Vijay. Talk about having fans come out to see you. 
 JORDAN SPIETH: Oh, yeah, a lot of them are friends from school and stuff, so it's awesome, the support I got today and I know in the morning some of them might not want to get up so early but they might make it by the back nine, but hopefully I can play well tomorrow and get a lot more support out there. 

 Q. One of your playing partners today, Bobby Gates, a former Texas guy, does that make it easier to play, with a fellow Texan? 
 JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I mean, you know, us Texans, I guess, have more personality. It's always good to learn from guys like him who have been through similar situations growing up in Texas, incredible player. He's a nice guy, had an unfortunate break, had a ruling, he had a penalty at the end but he fought back today. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JORDAN SPIETH: I've been out of class for a while now. All of us seniors have been out for a couple of weeks now. I'm not missing any school this year. Everyone is out now.
