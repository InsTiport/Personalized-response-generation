Q. Jordan, a solid win today, 2 under.  And a solid season.  You had two wins this year.  Reflect on that.
JORDAN SPIETH: It was a good season, pleased with it.  We had, I think, eight top tens.  Number of finishes just outside that.  You know, it's a kind of what-if season, couple shots here or there.  But all in all, I'm very pleased with it.  If you asked me what's a successful season next season, I'd say that the one I had this year was right there.
I'm a little bummed with the finish this week.  I feel very comfortable at East Lake, but going to take some momentum off today's round into the Ryder Cup.
Q. What are you most looking forward to at Hazeltine next week?
JORDAN SPIETH: The pressure.  It's going to be fun.  The first tee shot, getting into that rhythm, finding out who we're going to team up with and who we're going to play against, and then trying to feed off the crowd.  I've not played a Ryder Cup on American soil.  So it will be a really, really cool experience.
Q. We're looking forward to it.  Good luck next week.
JORDAN SPIETH: Thanks.
