Q. How tough was that match today?
JORDAN SPIETH: I mean, I don't think it would have been that tough to beat me today.  I just didn't have a really good day.  You know, sometimes that happens.  I just got a little off.
Yesterday I could feel it after the round with my driver.  I went to the range, a setup thing.  It kind of bit me on the first couple of holes today with a few out-of-play balls.  Patrick is a great competitor.  I felt like I fought hard around the middle of that match and then I just didn't quite have it today.
Q. Can you fix something like that in the short period of time, do you think?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, yeah.  It was just like an alignment thing that happens from hitting balls on the range into the wind a lot.  I just get a little open.  Just your typical stuff.  I just didn't make the adjustment early in the match today.  It was really tough conditions.
After the first few holes, I think I played the course under par.  So I'm proud of the way I fought after it looked like I could have shot who knows what today.
Yeah, it was a tough draw to have Patrick in the pod.  But that's how it works.  You have got to beat some of the best match play players in order to win this tournament.
I will go back and get ready for the next couple of weeks.
