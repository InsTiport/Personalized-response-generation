Q. What was going through your mind on the last hole?
JORDAN SPIETH: Your blood is running, it's running through your hands.  You know it's there.  I have a great trigger that I picked up at East Lake on those putts that I normally kind of push out to the right where I can really stay down through the ball; and just looking at the spot just in front of the ball allows me to get over the tension in my hand and make a nice, solid stroke over that point.  We could have made it a little easier from 90 yards out.  I could have gotten us below the hole.  But man, what a comeback we had there.  That was a great fight.  And it was a huge point in The Presidents Cup.
Q. Speaking of that comeback, you guys were 3-down and they were playing very well.  What gave you guys the belief that you could come back and win this match?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, we knew we were playing good.  We hit great shots on the front nine.  We didn't make a bogey all day.
So we knew we were playing solid.  We were hitting it in the right spots and giving good looks at it.  We just weren't rolling it in.  Finally on the back nine we made some putts and made some really good saves coming down the stretch.
Q. Playing with Patrick again, finally get some Ryder Cup memories?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I'm sure he'll be firing.  Hopefully we can get some putts to go and those two will hopefully lead into something this afternoon.  I'm looking forward to it, very much so.  I know he's ready to get a nice, solid point this afternoon for us.
