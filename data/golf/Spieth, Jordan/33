Q. Tough round today.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, very.  We saw it in the practice rounds a bit.  Wednesday it got kind of actually worse than it was today.  It was nice to have been out there Wednesday playing in it.  Actually when the weather was at its worst I hit the ball pretty well.
It's a day when you're starting the day within ten shots of the lead, it's the day you want because a couple under goes a long way.  And certainly you can see Tony, I think he's shooting even today or something like that or maybe 1-over or something like that and he's just moved up into third place if he finishes that off.  The two guys out front are just playing phenomenal golf.
Q. If you hit it well --
JORDAN SPIETH: Just in the bad parts.  I hit a lot of good putts, just nothing went in on the weekend.  I didn't make anything the last two days on some really good putts.  It's fine.  It happens.
Q. Do you take positives out of the week?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, a big bummer today.  I really would like on an off day to finish top-10.  I'm pretty bummed right now.  But it was my first -- after three weeks off and a lot of times you make some kind of rusty errors.  Certainly this weekend I wasn't patient with it.
Going into a pretty heavy stretch coming, and hopefully it gets better coming.
Q. Talk about the experience of being in Portrush for the first time.
JORDAN SPIETH: It was amazing, I hope it's on the rotation.  I enjoyed the golf course.  It played tough and fair.  It was scorable yesterday and maybe the afternoon before.  And they had it today it was really, really tough and showed its teeth.
In the town itself, the people were topnotch.  This tournament they always are.  Here and Augusta are my two favourite events in the entire world, and it never disappoints.  And it didn't here.  It was awesome.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JORDAN SPIETH: That's what I've been practicing in all summer.  So it will be a little more normal for me as far as yardages and whatnot.
So, yeah, it was great.  Honestly I've liked having weeks off after this event, to have the opportunity to hang around a day or two.  But with the condensed schedule it means if you want to keep playing, you've just got to deal with it and come back in the fall or something.
