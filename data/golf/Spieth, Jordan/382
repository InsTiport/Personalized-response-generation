 Q.  You had it going but not quite the finish you wanted?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No, to play the weekend even par was disappointing with the conditions we had, soft conditions, gettable.  To be honest, this was -- as poorly as I felt with my game, to shoot double digits under par, so it's actually a big step forward because I felt a little bit better than I did after those last couple events, but I still am lacking a bit of confidence in my game to really get through a lot of shots, which means I'm lacking a bit of consistency.  I've got some moments of some really good shots like with a birdie-eagle finish in that second round, but then my misses are just further off than they normally are, and that's what's killing me.  I'm making way too many over-par holes, too many mistakes that I'm not able to recover from.  You know, and that's good, though.  It's good, because I'm at 11-under in this tournament, almost a top 10, and I feel like I really didn't have my game this week, maybe like a C game, so if I can get it up there and work a bit on my putting this week, my coach will be there, if we can get things back on track, then I feel very confident about the outcome of Atlanta.   
 Q.  The boost going into Atlanta, you go there second in the standings with a very good chance to win the FedExCup still.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Sure, I don't know where I'll end up in the standings, but it'll definitely be in the top three, and from there you control your own destiny.  That's what's great.  There's plenty of things to say about the FedExCup Playoffs, why are they four times the amount, why is Jason's lead going to go way back to 200 points.  All in all, it really doesn't matter.  It's all for this setting, for Atlanta, and there's a lot of exciting players that are all in the mix that's going to create quite a finish for next week.  I mean, everyone is playing extremely well.  The top 10 in the world are all on their game, and that's what you want for the TOUR Championship.
