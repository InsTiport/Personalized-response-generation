 Q. How many fairways did you hit today?JORDAN SPIETH: Three fairways and seven greens -- well, 3 1/2 fairways.  I hit it down the wrong fairway one hole and then I birdied it.  When I hit the fairway, I think I made birdie every time, pretty close -- I bogeyed 11 from the fairway.
Q. That ball bounced out of the tree, didn't it?JORDAN SPIETH: Not on 11.  On 4 I hit it left and hit the trees and went into 9 fairway and I made birdie from there.
Q. So how did you think it was playing in general?JORDAN SPIETH: Very difficult.  The rough's really high.  I mean, it's hard for me to tell, because every course is going to play hard when you miss that many fairways.  You miss 11 fairways, so there's not going to be much of an opportunity to shoot a low score. But I felt like I really salvaged my round.  To be honest, 3- , 4-under, if that stays leading, if the wind picks up, I'm still in this tournament somehow, and it didn't look like that was remotely possible midway through the round.  So did a great job of staying calm and taking advantage of just a couple opportunities. So all in all, just got to get out there on the range and figure it out.  But I'll be all right tomorrow.  These kind of days are always followed by something good, so I'll have a good day tomorrow.
Q. Is there something specific that you wanted to work on when you go to the range?JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I'm just trying to work on the same thing I've been trying the whole week.  Just a little more rest than practice last week, but I'm just trying to get around my body a little more off the bat because I'm getting a little up high, and from there, it starts right and goes right or starts left and goes left.  It's a pretty big issue to get resolved but it's something that I've been working on before and played good golf working on it. So ultimately, I'll be all right.
Q. What was the gallery, the feel?JORDAN SPIETH: It was cool.  It was great.  It was great to see everyone behind Tiger welcoming him back and wishing him well.  He said that he's feeling great.  He said it's a little different starting out and he finally found his rhythm and we saw what happens when he found his rhythm there. So look for a pretty solid round tomorrow out of him.  Wouldn't be surprised if he shoots a few under.  No, it was great.  I enjoyed it.  It was cool playing the first one back. I love playing alongside Jason, as well.  We are all rooting for each other, and that's a good feeling.  It was hard to root for each other because it just looked like the lid was closed on the hole.  But once we all started hitting a couple fairways, it got better at the end.
