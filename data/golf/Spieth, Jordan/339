 Q.  How would you describe it out there for you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was tough.  Wasn't a very good round.  I got off to a poor start and I was behind the 8 ball with gusty winds, you know, on a tough golf course.   
So, yeah, I've been feeling good about my game.  I probably would have shot 5-under yesterday in the Pro-Am.  Unfortunately right now on my off days typically my history, I'm able to hold that around even par and I'm just shooting too high a number, you know, and didn't quite squeak out even today, even though it was an even kind of round, and hopefully less wind tomorrow and I can work hard to play on the weekend.   
 Q.  Can you fall into the trap of when you get into the trees if anything can go wrong, it will?  You did have some tree issues today.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.  Today was one of those days where you just seemed to be when you don't hit a great shot you don't deserve a good break but I ended up not having much out of the trees and then I actually drove it into a couple divots in the fairway.   
One of those days.  I hit it into -- I hit a pretty good shot on 18 and I get up there and it wasn't a divot that had been refilled, one from maybe a couple groups in front of us sitting straight down, and hack it.   
I actually hit a great shot on to the green.  Sure, it was kind of one of those days but that doesn't happen often.  I don't think that way often.  I don't think I fall into that trap normally.  Kind of one of those days.   
 Q.  You sort of except it as the nature of the game?  
JORDAN SPIETH: What good is kicking the door other than hurting my foot and withdraw?  I'm kidding.  No, I'll be fine.   
 Q.  What was your goal walking off 18?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Get even for the tournament.  I think I was 4 at the time.  I knew I'd have, you know, iron into No. 1 on a par 5 and wedge into 2 and couple other wedge opportunities.  I knew it would be very challenging.   
I thought 2-under would be a good score and 4 would be fantastic.  I just didn't hit enough greens.  I had the opportunities on a few holes today and actually there was a lot of holes where I thought if I hit great shots posing and it's 10, 15 yards off on the distance based on the gust of the wind.   
It was a very tough day.  I just caught the wrong gusts.  We guessed incorrectly.  You kind of get a 50/50 chance on a day like today on those into the wind shots.  I flew some greens where I thought they were perfect and backed off being aggressive, I tried to be a little more tentative on last few holes and just shot up in the air.  So, just happens.   
 Q.  What's the biggest correction you have to make for tomorrow?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I need to go just -- I'm not going to wear myself out.  I'm going to go rest.  I'm going to go probably take a nap and -- you know, it's a long time, 24 hours in between finishing here and starting tomorrow so, you know, tomorrow is a brand new day.   
 Q.  Does it feel different at all from last year?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.  The greens are about as slow as I can ever regular putting on the PGA TOUR.  I don't think they came in from a pretty rough winter here, unfortunately, but everyone got to play with it and you can actually, can be more aggressive so it could free you up.   
But it's so tough on some of these putts down the hill to hit them as hard as we have to hit them.  You saw some 3 putts that are not just from me but I mean Bill and Henrik, you saw 3 putts from 20 feet down the hill that you just -- they were left five feet short.   
You don't see it.  It's an adjustment.  It's something you got to trust.  It's one thing to practice on the greens and get used to it, it's another to actually do it.
