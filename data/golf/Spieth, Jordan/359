Q. Dustin, you and Jordan were 1-up after the 7th but weren't able to get a hole after that.  What was the difference after that 7th hole?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: On 8, they made a long putt.  They made another -- some really good putts on 9 and 10, too.  I had a couple putts to win the hole on 12 and 13, and hit pretty good putts.  Just they are tough.  Should have made them, though.  They weren't tough.  Just the wind made it a little bit difficult on the putting.
We played pretty solid all day, both of us.  Just we couldn't get it in the hole.
Q. Pretty obvious with your body language on how you feel you played.  You didn't seem like you were very pleased with your game.
JORDAN SPIETH: That was one of the worst rounds of golf I've felt over the ball in a long time.  I don't know what I owe it to but one of us was out of the fairway on every single hole and one of us was missing the green on every single hole.  We had no chances.  We didn't get anything to go.
It was just really poorly played.  And DJ counts on me to keep the ball in play and be consistent; I didn't do that to free him up to play his game.  You know, that was Merry Christmas to them.
Q. Hearing you say it's one of the worst rounds you've played in a while, very alarming; do you think you'll be able to work on?
JORDAN SPIETH: Sure, just a bad day.  Whatever it was, shake it off and be back.
