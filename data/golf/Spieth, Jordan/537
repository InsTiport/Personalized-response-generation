 Q.   You probably didn't believe you'd be in this position after you bogeyed six of your first seven holes of the Valero Texas Open.   What does it mean to you to be able to claw your way back?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   It means a lot.   I dug in deep.   It was difficult, I struck the ball horribly on Wednesday and let it kind of carry over.   We also had tough conditions in the morning.   Just never got into a groove.   
Just somehow fought back for 3‑under on that back nine that day, and it allowed me to somehow get in contention here.   That's what it's all about is grinding, and if things are going bad they'll turn around.   Had unbelievable support from the fans here, and obviously in the state of Texas and being home for me, I think that that definitely helped, too, carry me through.  
   
 Q.   We talked about the fact on Thursday that despite the bad start you still had a chance to win.   That was borne out here on Sunday.   When did you really think you were in contention here and had a chance to win this thing on the final day?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I birdied 6 and birdied 7.   4 and 5, I played 1‑over.   Probably needed to play those under par.   In order to come back from nine down you really have to have everything go perfectly.   But out on this golf course that can happen.   You can make a comeback.   When I made the birdie putt on 7 I was only four back at the time with the wind picking up, thought if I maybe got three more birdies, shot 3‑under from there on in, it would be good enough, and I think it probably would have.   Just so tough once we turned into the wind.   I would have had to play a perfect back nine.
