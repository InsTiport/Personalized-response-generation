  JORDAN SPIETH:   It was solid today.   To only have two bogeys, and they were early in the round.   And then to not have any blemishes after 7.   Played the last 11 holes in 3‑under, certainly very pleased with that.  
   
 Q.   Joking around this morning about what you would take today?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yes, at breakfast we were joking around, would you sign for 2‑over right now?   That's actually a tough question.   But that was obviously looking at the scores from this morning and those conditions.   And to be honest, had those conditions stayed that way my round probably would have been about that.  
We got really lucky there.   It will be a little cold in the morning, but it won't be as big a difference as today's round.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was still breezy.   It was still one and a half to two clubs in.   But earlier today it was around three, three and a half.   
15 and 16 would have been quite a bit different.   Our front nine was still about the same.   And then really those last I want to say five or six holes it really knocked it down for us.  
   
 Q.   Is your putter causing you to be calm this week?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I feel okay with it.   I don't feel quite as good as Tampa or even Doral.   I felt great at Doral, just with my alignment and getting through the ball.   
I'm still making some putts, catching a couple of lips.   I'm going to need to continue to work on it to get it back to where it was a few weeks ago, which is the comfort level I like to have.   Yeah, they're still going in, I just don't feel ‑‑ not quite there.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, not really.   Just enough repetitions, just enough reps and working on some four and eight footers around the hole.   
   
 Q.   What did you hit for the eagle?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I hit driver, 6‑iron, landed short of the green, a little soft, went on to the front edge, probably 20 feet and made it, 15 feet.
