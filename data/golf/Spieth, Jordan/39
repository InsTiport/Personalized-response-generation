 Q.  Assess your week here, please.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I drove the ball really well, just hit my irons poorly yesterday, which set me back. And then, man, I just historically, I've had a really hard time putting, reading these greens and it just continued this week. Felt like I put good strokes on it and then I would look up and I missed them by like a foot off line, which was very unusual for me. And, but overall I'm really happy with the progress I've made off the tee. I mean, that was the best I've driven the ball in a couple years. So when that happens I know the rest of it's kind of coming behind.   
So put in a good fight today. Just needed a little bit too much, and like I said, if you're not make being any putts, it's going to be hard to force 4-under. So the last hole I felt like I needed to go at the pin to get to 1-under. And that's my only regret of the day, is that I didn't at least give myself a chance on the last hole. But did a lot today to make it work, and I hit 17 -- or 16 greens, I guess, which is another really good sign.   
 Q.  How would you describe your comfort level with your swing, particularly your irons?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't really have a fade right now. That's what let me down this week. I knew I shouldn't have been playing fades, but sometimes you kind of have to. And I was probably 3- or 4-over cumulative, even if I was playing out of the fairway, with a wedge, playing fade this week. So that will start to come. I'm still kind of, on the fade, just kind of chopping down on it a little bit, so I've got to get a little more patient in my back swing. But overall, like I said, when the driver starts to come around, everything else -- that's normally last, so when that starts to come around, I'm not worried about the rest of the game. And I'm not worried about the putting either. I mean, I've had bad putting weeks where I've walked away saying, I don't know what's going on in the stroke. But I hit my lines almost every single putt and just simply misread them all. And I know that that's not the case historically for me on the three courses next week, so I'm looking forward to that.   
 Q.  You had a little bit more outward emotion on the course today. Does that speak to an overall sense of frustrated with the week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I think it was just will. I just really wanted it. I wanted to play the weekend. I had a bunch of buddies come in town. I wanted to kind of give them something to watch the next couple days. And just when you fall behind and you know -- I knew once I started hitting those tee balls down the fairway to start the round today, I knew I was going to give myself plenty of opportunities. So when I just, I couldn't do the easy part for me, which is the putting. That's what was so frustrating. It hasn't been like that. It's been putting saving me and today it was kind of a little bit of the opposite.   
So any emotion was just kind of a want or a will. It's not like overall frustration. I've got, I've had plenty of that. I'm done with that. I'm on the rebound now.
