 Q. If you're asking the rules official about backing into a bush, is that a bad sign?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was just a bad shot. And then started to get a bit better from there on in. I felt like I had plenty of‑‑ other than that tee ball, I felt like I set myself up well on the tee shots, just didn't hit irons close on holes that I really could have.   
But then I played a really solid back nine. So I have a fighting chance at least of shooting a good score and make this a real positive week.   
   
 Q. You're 4‑over on the front and 8‑under on the back, is that kind of the story of your week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, just not great starts so far this week. But the front nine is harder to score on than the back nine. I don't think that's totally out of the ordinary. I've historically played the front nine really well, but I've had an easier time on the back nine. But obviously shooting‑‑ getting back to even for the tournament on the front nine would be kind of nice next time around. And then see if we can make more on the back.   
   
 Q. And as far as the par‑5s, I think you're 2‑under, I think, for the week, does that sound right? How do you feel like you've played them?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, last week in San Antonio where the par‑5s were the hardest par‑5s on Tour, I played them probably best in the field, even though I finished like 30th, it was something ridiculous on those par‑5s. I think it's just kind of a fluke. 8 I hit three bad tee balls. 2 I hit a couple bad tee balls. And then I haven't given myself a good look at going to the green in two on 13. So it kind of hurts when that's the case.   
But other than that‑‑ I mean it's just been kind of the tee shots on the par‑5s that were just unusual bad ones out of the tee balls that I've hit this week. And obviously you want to take advantage of the par‑5s here.  
   
 Q. When you talk about the difference between first round, second round, working out some of the kinks, do you feel like the progression in the way (no microphone.)  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, everything just seems to tighten up. The club is still behind me and I'm out in front. And it's behind. And I'm favoring it on a lot of my shots. I'm just trying to find a way for that not to be the case. And I get closer and closer each week.   
And I hit some shots today that made me feel were really close and I hit some others that made me feel like we need to start over. So I think it's the latter. I think it's really close. I putted the ball better on the back nine today than I have the entire week as far as how my strokes felt. And so if it clicks tee to green, it could be a really fun one.
