 Q.  You reached the 6th hole, and any momentum you were trying to capture, sort of disappeared.  What happened there?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Well, I was just trying to do a little too much.  Instead of just firing a straight ball at the hole, trying to bleed some big cutter in, and I just double crossed it.  From there, the pin is actually located on a pretty tough little spot, where it -- you know, if you hit your first putt too hard, then you're left with a little bit of trouble.   
So I just got into some putting trouble today and couldn't quite get it going on the front nine.   
 Q.  A course like this, trying to get aggressive to move -- overcome that just a little bit more --  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, at that point, the tournament is over.  You just try and fight back to even par, which is tough to do.  Started to do it, and then the story of my week is just playing the easy holes poorly.   
You know, 11, 14, and 2, to play it whatever I played them, 7 or 8 over, on those holes the leaders are playing them under par.  Funny thing is I felt like I didn't have my game this week.  If I play the easy holes at even par, I'm still top 5.   
That's what's tough to swallow leaving this week is you do all this work on this course, and it was the easy little iron/wedge holes that tore me apart.  But I think that's just kind of bad timing on them.   
 Q.  Time to retreat and regroup.  What's ahead for you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, just go home this week, and then I'll look forward to World Golf Championship in Akron to try to gain some momentum for the next couple of majors.
