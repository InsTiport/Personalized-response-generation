Q. How would you assess your day?
JORDAN SPIETH: Good start and then that -- really 7 through 11 could have been really good and I just, I played 6 and 7 poorly and then that really kind of hurt me and then putter just kind of went cold.  So I was trying to shoot really a 6-under, 6-under on the weekend was the goal.  Thought if I could get to 17, have a good chance come Sunday afternoon.  And had plenty of opportunities today, just didn't cash in.
Q. Is it hard for you to assess where your game is right now, given the conditions, the greens, the wind everything?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, especially on the greens it's very difficult to assess, I think.
Q. You say you wanted 6-under, 6-under, are you just going to go gung ho tomorrow and see what happens?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, why not?  7th place doesn't really do a whole lot for me at the end of the day, so the idea is to fire at flags and just putt aggressively.  It's one thing to say it, it's another to be out there and then all of a sudden you just feel so uncomfortable trying to hit that hard and I struggled with that this week.  So I've just got to be really aggressive on the greens.
