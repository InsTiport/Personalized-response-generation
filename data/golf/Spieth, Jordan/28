 Q.  Jordan, how would you assess the round out there today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was probably the highest I could have shot today. I just didn't make anything. I didn't make any putt outside of probably six feet today, and I hit a lot of good putts. So yeah, I mean, it was -- wedge play and putting were a little bit off today, but I'm really pleased with shooting 3-under when it felt like it was the highest I could have shot. It played tougher. It was a different golf course this afternoon than it was either of the last two days, and it certainly looked a little different than this morning, so hopefully tomorrow morning we get it without the wind and a little bit more receptive, and we can take it deep.   
 Q.  Was the course firming up a little bit out there?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, yeah, there were certain holes where you started to see it get real shiny on the high points of the green, which is a sign of it obviously starting to bake out. If we don't get any rain, it looks like the weekend it could certainly play very firm.   
 Q.  I hear you guys say a lot, that's the highest I could have shot. Is that a positive thing to you or maybe a little bit of a fix?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it's frustrating but it's positive, yeah. I think when I'm saying it, I'm meaning it in a positive manner, I just simply -- I hit a lot of good putts and they either bounced a little bit or I just misread them, whatever it may be. From where I hit my tee balls, I really should have shot a lower score, so that part is frustrating. Especially when you feel good about kind of the way you're hitting it, it just seemed like I played a 7-under round and only shot 3. Yeah, just going to try -- in other words, I don't really need to change much, just hopefully more of them go in.   
 Q.  From last week, what did you take out of last week? Did you take more out of the first couple days or the weekend?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I don't know. Each week I've been trying to kind of figure out where things are and try and get in a groove, and the idea is to start to try and really get it going come August through kind of the next August. I feel like I'm happy with where things are progressing. I kind of had a long way to go when we went into quarantine and I feel like I've come a long way since then to where I actually stand on the tee feeling like I can go low each day versus I'm fighting a lot of things.   
It doesn't feel like I have full command of every shot like I'd like, but I'm working in that direction, and more and more shots seem to be kind of -- I have more shots going where I'm looking each week so far.
