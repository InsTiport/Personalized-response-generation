 Q.  Right now, still inside the top five, what are your reflections on the week overall?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I was talking with Michael up the 18th fairway saying, wow, birdie here, we're definitely Top-10, and I felt like we were off this week.  We were off this week.  I didn't make anything.  I didn't quite a few myself a lot of chances the first couple rounds.   
I didn't get in a rhythm, and when I did have chances, they just wouldn't go.  Just a little off on the read or the speed, one of the two.  Sometimes that happens during a week, and we kind of grinded out 8-under on the weekend in what really could have been something special but it also could have been worse.   
Kept our head in it there the back nine, really finished 4-under on the last seven holes to carry some momentum going forward off of a week that I could have just bagged it in.   
 Q.  You're a bit of I globe trotter at the moment, Middle East this week and Singapore next week.  Can you tell us about the inspiration behind that?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I've always wanted to visit here and I've always wanted to visit there.  I've heard from quite a few people that it's arguably the best city in that part of the world, very clean, very fun to go to, good food, great golf course.   
It's an event that we've kind of had our mind on for a year or two and thought it might work out on a trip around the world here, go this way and just kind of puddle-jump over there I guess and go home.  I'm excited to get home.  I'm excited for rest.  But next week will be fun.   
 Q.  This has been your first regular European Tour event this week.  Can you give us your overall impression of your experience on the European tour?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I would say it felt like a normal PGA Tour week in my mind.  Sorry if that insults people; sorry on either side of the pond.  Yeah, everything was fantastic here:  Place to travel to; the hotel, food, accommodations were great; the golf course and the competition.   
Yeah, just felt like another week.  We just happened to be somewhere outside the U.S.
