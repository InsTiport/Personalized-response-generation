 Q.   Talk about the day.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Happy with the way I fought back and it's nice to finish a round golf course under par in the last few holes.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you are a little anxious in this setting?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, it felt like I was forcing some things, especially when you see Keegan shoot 10‑under.   I was driving up to the first tee and I thought maybe that was the Pro‑Am score and maybe I was trying to fire too much instead of letting it come to me.   
   
 Q.   Were you fighting out there or were you letting go a little bit?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I got back from the three‑week stretch and my swing has been a little off.   I'm working on some stuff and it's difficult to do.   I drove the ball great, that's what I've been struggling with, but with my irons I was a little off today.  
   
 Q.   What are your feelings today going around this course as opposed to the first time?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   You get more and more comfortable each round.   I got settled in fine, just didn't make as many putts as I wanted to, at the same time I only hit four greens on the front nine and that's not going to cut it on a course like this.   
It didn't have anything to do with the course, it's just me personally.   I need to be conservative and not press it.   
   
 Q.   Will you feel pressure tomorrow?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, we're off early, try and get out there and play my game, and the birdies will come, I had five today.   They'll come and I just need to limit some mistakes and I'll be good.
