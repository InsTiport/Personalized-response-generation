 Q.  Obviously very different course with the overnight rain and rain this morning.  How long did it take you to adjust to the different speed of the fairways and particularly the different pace of greens?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It didn't take much to get to the used to the ball striking part of it.  On the greens they were a wicked two feet faster on the Stimp meter at least, even after all that rain.  They were so smooth, they were pure and they were really nice to putt on.  But, man, I hit almost every midrange putt I had a good two to four feet past the hole.  Luckily I hit quite a few in there close enough to be able to knock in relatively straight putts for birdie on the front nine.  It was an adjustment on speed control on the greens for sure.   
 Q.  Talk about the seventh hole.  That was a complicated drop you took because you had water and the cart path and another disappointing result on that hole?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I just tried to find out exactly all the options I had and ultimately taking relief from casual water gave me the best opportunity to still drop it on the cart path, play it on the cart path.  It took a while because of different drops.  We weren't sure where my stance would still be and it wasn't full relief.  Ultimately I still ended up playing with a toe in the water.  Because the angle had changed from the angle of my stance looking at the pin, he said he was very happy with it, that it was relief and I was altering my stance to play a different shot, which is true, from where the other drop would have been, which is going right at it.  It was really weird.  It was as complicated as I've ever really had it.  Took about as much time as I've ever taken on a free drop.   
It was resolved.  I hit a pretty good shot, really wish I could have made par there.  Just don't hit it right on No. 7.  I have done it two days in a row.   
 Q.  Did you have relief from the path as well?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I originally could have taken relief from the path.  My drop would have been to the left, and that would have caused me to have little to know shot.  So I wanted all my options, one of my options was you can take relief from the causal water without taking relief from the path.  Because he asked me, hey, if there were no casual water on the cart path, what would you do here?  I said I would for sure play it.  I would play it off the path.  Anybody would.  There is no other shot from left there except to try and punch -- you can't even punch back out to the fairway.  You would have to punch up No. 10.  I decided to take we relief from the casual water which I didn't do correctly the first couple of drops.  I ended up still standing in it.   
Finally, on the last one, it went into a location more straight back in line with the hole where I could then have a stance in line with the hole that would not be in casual water.  I then altered my stance to play a different shot than what I would have played had it been on the original angle of my drops.  Because of that, he said we were following the correct rules and we were taking relief.  I was just altering the stance with a toe that was up.  It wasn't resting in it because it was on the cart path and it was dug down.  I say cart path, it's that gravel.  So the waters dip down.  So my toe wasn't on the water, I don't know if it matters or not, but it was certainly hovering over it.  It was a different angle in flight at the right of the green that he said was appropriate.  So I trust my rules official there.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, 100 percent.  I would have never hit if I was not told it was okay by a rules official.  He told me it was fine.  Really don't know why we were talking about to be honest.  It was a casual water relief drop that took a little extra time.  I guess obviously people are talking to you thinking it should be a problem, but it was no problem.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I'm hitting the ball fantastic.  I just can't get a putt to go in outside ten feet.  And from ten to 20 feet, the amount of opportunities I've had that aren't that difficult, up to my putting standards I would be 5, 6, 7 strokes better right now.  It feels like it's a bit of a struggle adapting line and speed control on the greens.  Inside of ten, I made quite a few good birdie putts today to get me in contention.   
I'm striking the ball beautifully.  Driver went a little astray, but overall I feel like I'm in a good position to make a run, I just need a couple good rounds.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Oh, no.  Never thought about it once I hit my shot.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Okay.  That's fine.  There was microphones.  It can be reviewed that he said, hey, this is relief from it.  You are changing the view.  We've fallen under the rule to make this appropriate.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No.  Like I said, I never thought twice about it whatsoever.  I don't think there's any problem with it.  If there happens to be then that's not on me.  I literally asked every question I could ask and I got every answer I could be to be content.  That's first and foremost what you are trying to do is obviously abide by the rules.  If I had to go over any more, if he told me I did then I would have.  He said it was just fine, so it was just fine.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, the course just changed a lot today, and it will continue to stay receptive off the tee and into the green.  Unfortunately, I think for everyone this course yesterday was -- it started to be pretty nice seeing balls bounce and having the control shots into greens versus throw low ones into the back and hope they don't spin too much.  That's just the way it's going to be.  Just adjust to it accordingly.   
Yeah, I just need to get -- find a nice rhythm with my putting stroke.  That's what's next.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Ball is not rolling the fairway and then it's extremely receptive on the greens.  I'm not sure, it's hard to tell how different they are going to putt compared to what we saw yesterday afternoon.  They were certainly different in the morning, but that is the way it is on poa annua.  It's very different morning to afternoon.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I mean, I got third in the World Golf Championship a couple tournaments ago.  Yeah, I feel good.  Again, I've been striking the ball well.  My putting was great.  It just got a little off at The Open.  I just didn't hit them hard enough.  I haven't really adjusted to the speed here.  Once that comes and my putting gets back, then I'm firing on all cylinders.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JORDAN SPIETH: They blue the horn right before they were going to announce our names.  So we waited in the tent object 10 for about 40 minutes or so, 50 minutes and then we just went out and teed off.
