Q.   How would you describe the way you played?
    JORDAN SPIETH:   Solid, yeah.   I was happy. 
    Didn't strike the ball particularly well at Hilton Head a couple of weeks ago.   Put in some good work at the end of the week with my instructor at home.   Put it to the test out here and it was good.   It was a solid round, one bogey and I think five or six birdies there.   I would certainly take it the rest of the week.

Q.   People always say it's hard to get to the top, hard to stay at the top.   Now that you're at the position you're in, No. 2 in the world, do you find the continuation of excellent play more difficult or perhaps easier because you are playing so well at the time?
    JORDAN SPIETH:   I don't really find much of a change, to be honest.   I'm certainly more comfortable in certain situations.   When the pressure is on, I can look back at the Masters and other high‑packed, pressure situations where I've seen putts go in and it's a little easier on the greens.   All in all, nothing feels very different for me.   It's just another week.

Q.   It's got to be feeling good.   Tell me about today's match. 
    JORDAN SPIETH:   It was good.   I look at our group.   I think it's tough.   There's guys that have all won recently.   Really good match play players, as well.   It's good to get off to a good start.   I played solid golf today.   It got a little interesting there on the back 9.   Big turn around on 12 and 13 to get 3‑up and close it out on 16.   I'm extremely pleased.

Q.   Have you had a chance to exhale since Augusta?
    JORDAN SPIETH:   Sure, yeah, yeah.   I got to rest for a few days, work my way back slowly.   We had some not‑so‑great weather.   All in all, I got some good work in with Cameron.   I knew what I needed to do when I got out here. 
    We've been trying to save some energy.   Hopefully it's a long week.   At the same time, you got to get used to the greens and the rough out here.

Q.   Matt Every up next for you. 
    JORDAN SPIETH:   Not only did he win at Arnie's event, but also been playing well the last few weeks.   Matt is a strong player, really good putter of the golf ball.   I have to play a round like today to win.

Q.   You have been introduced a couple times on the tee now as Masters champion.   That has to be awesome and yet it carries a lot of responsibilities.   Has your golf game changed at all?   Do you have an added burden on you because you have that jacket?
    JORDAN SPIETH:   I don't think so.   Nothing has really changed.   I feel the same inside the ropes, feel more comfortable on the greens with shorter putts just having made them under pressure at the Masters and other pressure situations. 
    So all in all, if anything, there's just a little bit of an added comfort level, almost like I'm free rolling.   That was just a huge goal that we accomplished.   Still need to work hard because it's not obviously the ultimate goal.   It would be really nice to advance here, get to play some good guys and move closer to No. 1.
