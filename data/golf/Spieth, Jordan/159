 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
JORDAN SPIETH: I hadn't really missed a shot in the first 12, 13 holes and I was 1-over.  I just got a little erratic, just had a rusty short game, honestly.  Just a rusty putter right now, just trying to get into the thick of things and hit putts that matter.  A month off, it sometimes happens, and I'm not really taking, not thinking too much about it.   
 Q.  Are you concerned about anything mechanically or anything or do you feel like this is just a competitive rust issue?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Well, it's something that Cameron and I have worked on since after Tiger's event.  There's some significant adjustments I'm making in my putting that will take some rounds to get comfortable and to a level where I think I was at the last couple years with my putter.  So, it's just stuff that needs on course reps in tournament play and didn't expect it to be on fire at all at the start and if it was, that would have been an advantage.   
 Q.  Can you explain some of those changes?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Just some setup stuff.  Just some comparisons to 2015 and 2016 that I kind of got a little lazy with in 2017 with the putter.  So I'm just trying to get back to where I feel as comfortable as I can over the ball.
