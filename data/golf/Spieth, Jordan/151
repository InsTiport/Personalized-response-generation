Q. Had to have been a fun walk even though it wasn't the result you wanted in singles?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, the last couple holes, it was nice to extend the match a couple extra holes and kind of make Jhonny earn it, I guess.
I was watching the screens all day.  It was a weird situation because you want to be able to like be there when we get the clinching point, but you also want to win your match.
I just didn't play well today.  But really proud of the team for the way we played this week.  Really proud of the way I played this week, especially yesterday.  What a solid week for the U.S. Team, and the Internationals came out guns a-blazing today to certainly make us think.
Q. You got that pick four years ago and now you're an International Team vet for this U.S. Team.  But with all of this young class being here, what have you seen this week in terms of the growth and development of you guys as a team, because it felt like that for the first couple of days?
JORDAN SPIETH: I think guys just got to know each other a little bit better, I think develop some relationships -- you see this every year, but develop some relationships further that we can take throughout the year.  A lot of times, guys travel with their teams and you don't see a whole lot of each other.  This week, you have no choice; you're with each other and you start to get to know each other, and nights like tonight where you can celebrate a team win are very memorable, and we're certainly looking forward to it.
