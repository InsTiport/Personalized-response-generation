  JORDAN SPIETH:   4‑under after two days is a solid place to be at out here when 8‑under seems to be the score that normally wins after Sunday. 
So, I would like to see a little bit more wind than today on the weekend, have a chance to shoot a few under and make up some ground. 
Yeah, very pleased with today.   Got a really good draw again, on top of yesterday.   So I took advantage.

Q.   How different was the condition today compared to yesterday?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, very different.   It was cold this morning, we had three layers on.   With no wind that's still not too bad.   And then by the third hole we were shedding layers.
It played about as easy as I think it can play today.   A couple of the pins were still in tough locations.   There will be some more gettable locations this weekend.   But all‑in‑all this was the day to take advantage.

Q.   How excited are you about the weekend now, after improved play today?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, yeah, very excited.   2 back as of now, not sure where that will stand.   But that's right in contention, right where I want to be.   And obviously chasing I think it's Aaron and Jimmy right now, two really, really good players, that are not really going to give up the leads easily.   I'm going to have to really bring my "A" game.

Q.   Do you feel the support out there?   Because every time you hit a shot the crowd just‑‑ all sorts of electricity out there?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, sure.   It was fantastic.   Coming back to Texas, seeing familiar faces, friends, family.   And then playing alongside Jimmy who is a local here in San Antonio, it was a lot of fun.   Had a lot of Hook 'Em Horns and a lot of cheers in our group.   So that was fun.
