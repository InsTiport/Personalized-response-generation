Q. Round kind of similar to yesterday's?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I just 3-putted the last or it would have been the same thing.
Yeah, really pleased with the way that we can streak the right direction, five birdies in a row or 5-under in six holes, four birdies pretty much in a row to finish.  Really pleased with that part of the game.
It's just obviously on this golf course with how wide the fairways are and how big the greens are, you really should not play many over-par holes, and to have five the last two days; I mean, last year, I may have had one bogey each round instead of those five.  That's nine shots, I'm in the lead.
So it's close.  It's really close.  Just a little bit of bad timing and a couple bad breaks that didn't have last year.
Q. What was the particular areas of rust coming into this week that you showed up and you don't feel like you have?
JORDAN SPIETH: It all comes down to just a little bit of the consistency.  We practice quite a bit in the off-season and work on things, and then you get into a tournament and you see obviously see tougher pins than you're used seeing at a country club, and pins that are in trickier locations with grain.
Also, you have to commit to different shots that you may not normally have to commit to on a daily practice basis.  So just a little bit of fine tuning, getting into that kind of rhythm.  Picking your right spots to hit enough greens within makeable range to start getting the rhythm of the putter.
I really haven't putted well this week.  I made a couple long ones today but missed quite a few where I've just bailed out on a stroke and I think it's just a little bit of lack of consistency and the amount of chances.
Q. How have you seen Justin Thomas has improved since he's been on the PGA TOUR?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, definitely.  I think his course management has gotten significantly better.  As a young player on TOUR, you come out -- all of us have to deal with it.  You really have to manage the course better than you ever have before, and it's always an adjustment for everybody to start.  He certainly kicked gear into that.
He's also obviously learned how to win and close tournaments out.  He's the only guy who beat Hideki all fall.  He was beating the hottest player in golf at his hottest time, so he's certainly not scared of that.  And off the tee, he's certainly got more consistent.
