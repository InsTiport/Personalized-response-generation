Q. How would you describe that round?
JORDAN SPIETH: A bit weak.  I played the hardest holes on this golf course 4-under par.  And then I played all the easy ones over par.  Just kind of a bit odd.  I just was not quite dialed in with the wedges or short game.  I had three chances on par-5s, green side, just little chip shots, just basic shots, and I made par as well as bogeying that 115 yard par-3.
So a little frustrating with that.  But all in all, to actually shoot 1-under with what I felt like I should have shot today is promising, considering we're going to the two easier courses, in my mind.
Q. What do you feel like you should have shot based on how you hit the ball?
JORDAN SPIETH: Just from the positions we were in I would say, if I had a solid day with my short game and wedges, it would have probably been 6- or 7-under.  It depends on if I would have made the putts.
But a couple misreads here and there, but then just didn't really give myself a lot of chances.  Like I said, again, to finish at 1-under par and play those very challenging holes well, kind of serves me right.  But I'm pretty pleased about it.  But with no wind, any of these courses, you're going to have a lot of chances.  And between me and Dustin both, we just looked just a little weak, like not quite committing to our shots.
Q. Did it take you awhile to get going?  Seemed like the front nine some of the approaches were a little errant.
JORDAN SPIETH: I was hitting a couple shots where I told Michael that's one out of 50 or one out of a hundred where I hit wedge that far off line.  Stuff that I don't need to look into too much, it was just bad timing where the misses were, in the wrong spots.  Shots like on 4, that's one of my top couple favorite holes of this week.  I love that hole.  And it's really frustrating, because I love it so much, to hit the shot I hit in there and bogey it.  I had just a full pitching wedge, a good number, and looking to have maybe inside 15 feet from there.  But, yeah, I don't know if it was -- I felt fine getting going.  I hit the ball well on the range.  Felt pretty confident with the way I was stroking the ball.  Just got a couple bad breaks early on.
No. 1, kind of the bounce through the green and then stopping where it did, if it had released another foot it would have actually released right next to the hole.  From there, instead of starting 1- or 2-under, I start 1-over.
But, hey, again, I've got a lot of very easy golf holes coming in the next couple days, if I put myself in positions off the tees, and I'll certainly get better when it comes to the wedge play.
Q. Wayne Gretzky, The Great One, he's obviously quite the character.  I know you were focused on playing, but what was it like being grouped with him?
JORDAN SPIETH: It was great.  We played together last year and got to know him a little bit and it's obviously incredible any time you get to spend time with someone whose been the best at whatever they do.  Whether it's business, entertainment, sports.  He's obviously, he's set records that I don't think will ever be matched in the sport of hockey.  I think a lot of people agree with me with that.  So, pretty unique.
It's kind of fun to see him having fun, doing something different.  He loves golf.  He's a golf nut.  We have a really good time, the four of us.  Sometimes too much.  Sometimes we're laughing still while we're getting over our putts.  But that's the beauty of this tournament.
