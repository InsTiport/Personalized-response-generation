 Q.  In your press interview yesterday you said you've learned more this year than any other year in your career.  What is the big thing you take from it?  
JORDAN SPIETH: A lot of different things about different parts of my game.  It's still a work in progress right now.  And if I step on the first tee and understand my swing, it's not going to be where I want it to be totally that day.  And that's somewhat difficult.  I'm making more mistakes around than I'm used to making.  But I got the putter going and played the easy holes pretty well this week, especially the par-5s in order to move up the board and have a chance to make it.   
 Q.  Just on the first hole.  What is it that's really clicking with this now?  
JORDAN SPIETH: My setup has been better, so my timing of the striking of the ball has been better.  I haven't forced the strike on the ball, just a motion with the shoulders.  It's that simple, back to basics.   
 Q.  Is this an example on 3 where you're using all of your skills to produce the score?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, that was inside of four feet there.  The short game is starting to come around, too.  That was actually probably the most difficult to trust what I'm trying to do with my swing to get around my body.  I'm used to playing in a steeper position around the greens.  That shot was awesome.
