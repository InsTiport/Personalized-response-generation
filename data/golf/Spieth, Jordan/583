  JORDAN SPIETH:   Got a really lucky break on the chip shot.

Q.   How did you do patience‑wise, mentality‑wise? 
JORDAN SPIETH:   Okay.   I knew things weren't going to go as perfectly‑‑ it's hard to hit 18 greens in regulation.   So there was going to be stress involved.   Felt like I handled it well to start the day. 
I mean, making a double on the easiest hole on the course and then following up with bogey on par 5 with a lob wedge in my hand, it was very difficult at the turn for me to stay calm and hit good shots to start the back nine, kind of turned it around. 
Maybe lost a couple shots with my emotions there, which is upsetting, but like I said, I shot 5 under yesterday, I could shoot 5 under tomorrow and be in great position.
