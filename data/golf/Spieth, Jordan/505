 Q. You were given Henrik the stare there.  How do you take that out to the course this weekend?JORDAN SPIETH: Well, you guys were talking about the European side being so strong at the Ryder Cup, so that's what I thought of that.
Q. It's been a pretty amazing year for you.  How do you feel in this year's U.S. Open?JORDAN SPIETH: I feel great.  I look back and I've actually played more than half of the events that I'll play this year, but there's only been one Major played.  So I feel like the biggest tournaments are yet to come, including this week.  I feel like the year's kind of only halfway through or not even yet. So there's just a lot of stuff on my plate for the rest of the year, a lot of goals that I have yet to try and accomplish.  So yeah, playing well here, playing a different course than Martin, but you know, you just never know what will happen with the golf course, as long as the rain holds off.  I think if the course gets harder and harder, that's the only way any of us will catch him, the way he's playing right now.
Q. What was your initial reaction getting to the course today or turning on the TV and seeing he had thrown up two 65s and is 10-under?JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I saw that.  I typically don't watch any, but today I wanted to see because I had heard that the greens were more receptive and that that rain really made a difference.  So I turned it on and I saw a lot of shots coming into greens, obviously saw all of Martin's shots for a few holes there. He's just hitting it in the right spots and then he's making putts.  He's not making any mistakes, he's not missing many fairways, and from there he's -- if he misses a green, it's right below the hole where he could get up-and-down.  Then he's got to be leading the field in putting.  That's going to put him at the top.  It is difficult to come to this kind of golf course and see somebody tearing it up and trying to still stay patient, even though you know that in order to catch the lead you got to do something special.  So you just can't force it. Early in the round, I just wasn't hitting any fairways and then started to really find a groove there until I went back away from it again at the end of the round.  But that's just going to happen out here.  To shoot 1-under through two rounds on Wednesday, I mean I would have taken that in a heart beat. So no complaints here.  I just need to -- if the greens are going to be like that, I'm going to have to make some more birdies in order to catch him.  But the way this tournament normally works, it's not going to be that way, it's going to play harder and harder.  So I would duplicate my round right now for the next two rounds.
Q. You had a front row seat to Martin's last win, what was your biggest takeaway from that?JORDAN SPIETH: Well, he's back.  I remember watching him at No. 1 in the world and when he won the PGA, and I always liked his game.  He just plays that high fade and doesn't make many mistakes and he works really hard.  He works really hard behind the seasons, he's here early, he's here late, and especially lately he's been obviously grinding to get back and for such a nice guy and such a classy guy, somebody who has offered advice to me and put his arm around me when things weren't necessarily going well at the PLAYERS, when we were in the final group.  You can only root for the guy.  You just hope that I can make a couple extra ones. But I've always been a fan of his game, he's back on top right now and playing incredible.  I never played on TOUR when Tiger was doing this, leading by six, seven, eight shots, but I imagine this is what it was like the way Martin's playing this week.
