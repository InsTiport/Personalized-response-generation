Q.   Jordan, you had a pretty solid round today.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Very stress free.   My longest par putt was 3 feet.   We had a very getable course today.   The wind was down in the morning with no rough and big greens, we were able to hit a lot of greens in regulation, have a chance to make some birdies.   I played the par-5s 1-over.   That's really where you get strokes out here.   That's very poor.   I'm going to have to improve on that.

Q.   You told us this week you really want to work on hitting a straight ball.   Did you try that today?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   It's tough when the wind comes up.   It was a lot easier earlier in the morning, and last few holes it started to come up.   I tried to do a little too much.   Yes, the swing feels good.   Struck some really solid iron shots.   Ball striking improved week to week over the last couple and hopefully continues to do so.

Q.   Jordan, how was it out there today?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Playing very getable.   Soft greens and the speed of the greens, you could certainly make some putts.   Par-5s were very getable.   I played them 1-over.   That was the challenge today.   I played a good solid round of golf with no par putt over 3 feet, which is how you want to play the golf course except for, you know, would have liked to grab a couple under on the par 5 instead of 1-over.   Right now obviously stings a little, but a tough finish to the round.   All in all still in it.

Q.   What happened on 17?
JORDAN SPIETH:   No. 8?   Hit my drive left and hit the cart path.   Went on No. 2 green.   Took a drop, and from that far over, it was really tough to get the yardage and the wind and I had plenty of club to reach the green.   It wasn't like I was going to lay way back.   Instead of erring short, I took a hybrid and tried to be a little too aggressive and it bit me.   From 40 yards left of the fairway it's very tough to find out exactly what your yardage is to the hole and to figure out the angle on which you're coming in to get the wind.   That's what Michael and I struggled with there.   We didn't get it right.   We thought we were far enough over for it to be hurting and it wasn't.   It was still helping.
