Q. So much motion on the leaderboard.  You're trying to make your move.  Describe how it went for you in trying to just make a change, make a challenge.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it went pretty well.  Got off to a dream start for moving day, and then just kind of boned a wedge, kind of put a bad swing on a pretty stock shot that killed momentum.  I went double bogey, bogey.
I played three holes at 4 over today with a wedge in my hand from the middle of the fairway, and it's just kind of a bummer.  You're not going to be able to do anything at a U.S. Open if you get the wedge opportunities and you play them over par.
So felt like still really happy with the way we played after that, and come out tomorrow and try and pull a Johnny Miller.
Q. Mission's clear.  What do you do?  Anything different?  Play it the same way?
JORDAN SPIETH: No, probably play it the same way.  Those wedge opportunities are -- normally, out of those three, at least 1 under versus playing 4 over.  That's five shots right there.  I'd have shot 65.  So I don't even know if that's what we need tomorrow.  So I don't need to play any different, just hit my wedges a little closer.  Just bad timing on a poorly executed shot.
