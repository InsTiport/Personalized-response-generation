Q.   How much does the excellent putting alleviate the pressure from the long game?
JORDAN SPIETH:   It certainly does, yeah.   I feel comfortable taking a little‑‑ we take a safer line on our approach shot.   We're able to get to a midrange putt and feel really good on these greens.   They are new greens, which means putts don't break as much as, say, give it a few years and the grass grows in more. 
We really found a rhythm today.   That was some luck involved to make that many midrange, long range putts.   To play with no bogeys, the way that we played, I knew I had to play a strong round and we did.

Q.   What was your thought process as you got back in it?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I was happy it was early in the round.   I was happy that it was only through the first couple of holes, then through five holes.   At that point it was nice to see that one go in on 6 and 7 there, two that didn't expect to go in from that range. 
Once that happened, I kind of climbed back to even on the match, from there it was just going to be a fight.   We just happened to make some more putts.

Q.   6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12, birdie run.   Just your normal putting stroke? 
JORDAN SPIETH:   I think over the last couple of days we've been trying to adjust to the speed of these greens.   They are slower than we're used to.   They are firm and seem like they are going to be fast, but they putt slower.   I had a lot of time.   We were delayed a long time to start today given matches were going extra holes.   So maybe just spending an extra hour on the putting green today, I was able to get a good rhythm to get the speed on the greens. 

Q.   It looks like a comfortable win.   If you don't make that 12‑footer on 14, now it's suddenly 2 and anything can happen.   That was a huge par you made at 14?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I've had that happen to me.   I tell you what, it's not fun.   You pretty much are expected to win the hole and then to come back and make that putt after a poor chip.   That was just kind of the tale of that second half of the round. 
Matt played some really, really good golf today.   We just happened to be really on our game.   I have to stay that way.   With our pod kind of mixed around, I think I'm going to have to win tomorrow or else I'm out.
