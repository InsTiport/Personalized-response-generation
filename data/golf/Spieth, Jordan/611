 Q.   Some weekend.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   Better than Thursday and Friday.   
   
 Q.   What turned it around?   What made the difference?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I think driving the ball.   I was more confident with my longer clubs.   I played.   I was hitting.   My fairway percentage went up maybe double.   So that was probably the difference in the two days.   
   
 Q.   Fog starts to roll in, was that even a factor at all today?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I don't think so.   It kind of confuses you, you know what the predominant wind direction is and you see the fog moving fast one way and you could second guess it, but it's not really doing anything to the ball.   
   
 Q.   What do you interest a tribute your better play on the weekend to?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Just driving it better.   I hit more fairways.   I think knowing the course, I had only played one practice round, so I went into Thursday, I had seen the course, but nothing like after five days of playing it.   
So I think that was a big factor too was just knowing which places you can miss and which you just can't.   
   
 Q.   What were your goals coming into this week as far as what you wanted to accomplish?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I was confident coming in.   I was kind of just‑‑ I didn't expect to get in.   I was running on some adrenaline from the national championship and then got a call late Monday night and kind of rushed out here.   
So really I just wanted to play consistent golf.   I kind of thought that I could give myself a chance at making a run at it.   After two rounds I was, I wasn't able to do that, but I wanted to be low amateur and there's a possibility that can happen, even though Beau's playing great golf.   
   
 Q.   Talk about his golf.   You guys aren't that far apart in age, but and you've both come here and played well.   Look at him and talk about it?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   He's a good friend of mine in junior golf the last couple years, and I think that I would like to say that I helped him, convince him to come to Texas, along with obviously our coaches.   He gave me a lot of calls, along with a couple other guys on the team to find out some stuff about the university.   
So I've been close to Beau and we're aware of how good a player he is and what he's capable of doing, and he's just walking with a little extra cockiness in his step out here.   
He just looks really confident on the course and he's handling himself well off the course too.   So it's just been an all‑around great effort by him and cool to see him sporting the Longhorn gear out there.   
   
 Q.   What are your plans for the rest of the summer as far as what you're going to compete in?   What are you doing until school starts back up?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I'm actually going play in some TOUR starts this summer.   I have two right now, Congressional in two weeks and I guess a week and a half now and then John Deere and right now I have the U.S. Amateur.   And those are kind of the only three that are on at right this second and looking for a couple of other exemptions.   
   
 Q.   If you don't get low amateur for this, will it be less of an experience than you had, or how do you view that?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, definitely not.   With how I played on the weekend, 1‑under for the two rounds, I couldn't really ask for anything more.   So it wouldn't be because I gave it away, it would be because Beau earned it.   
So I would be obviously really happy for him, I've been happy watching him.   It's been pretty cool.   So obviously that was a goal of mine, but if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world I'm happy with how I finished out.
