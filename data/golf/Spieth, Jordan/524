 Q.   Jordan, that last putt meant something to you, obviously, to keep this streak going.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I had an opportunity to play three full rounds, bogey‑free.   And it was really ugly coming in, but somehow did I it.   I got a lot of great bounces, got a lot of great breaks today for not having my best day ball striking or really putting.   
So it meant a lot to me, it was a putt I didn't necessarily expect to go in, putting through that fringe.   You want to hit it with the right speed and if it bounces, it bounces, if it rolls true, it rolls true.   And, fortunately, that one rolled true.   And I think it was the longest putt I made all day.   
So it was nice to see one go in and it meant a lot to me before I hit it, so that's good news going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   More importantly, here you go again.   You're where you want to be, right?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, yeah, definitely.   Could have taken advantage of a lot more opportunities today, but also had a lot of good breaks.   
So if you told me I was going to hit it like that, before the day started, I would have signed for 1‑under and said thank you and walked away.   
So I'm very excited about where my game's at, I think it will be back there tomorrow striking the ball and finding more fairways and hopefully that leads to more birdies.
