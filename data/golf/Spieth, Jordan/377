 Q.  How important was the 21-footer for birdie on 8 coming as it did after the back to back bogeys?  
JORDAN SPIETH: 8 was important.  8 was a nice putt.   
I think 9 was a dagger.   
8 was a great birdie because we played it the right way.  I was in between clubs, played the safe shot.  And I just needed to see something go in, needed something to fall.  And it was really, really nice.  The one on 9 was a steal.  I hit a poor second shot and that put a dagger in it.   
 Q.  Henrik spoke as if 11 was the dagger, because he was looking at making up a stroke possibly.  Could you see the wind go out of his sails a little bit?  
JORDAN SPIETH: On 10, Henrik missed it.  I had a pretty short putt to be 3-up, and I missed that.  He hits it close on the next hole and I have a possible 3-putt.  Could have very easily walked out that have hole tied for the lead.   
So to walk out two strokes up and to be able to kind of par in from there, that was definitely the key moment.  I think 9 started to move that direction, 10 gave a little hope back, and 11 shot the door.   
 Q.  So, you earned on the course, and in bonuses this year, 1 million dollars for every year you've been on the planet.  What do you make of that?  How do you even process that?  
JORDAN SPIETH: That's great.  It's fantastic.  I have an opportunity now, with a year like this and a bonus like that, to celebrate and to share it with the people that have made it possible.  And that's kind of the plan.  Our team did an unbelievable job this year.  Everything was exactly how we needed it to be to peak at the right times.  If we can continue to do that, then we'll have more seasons like this.   
But right now, we're going to enjoy it, and I'm able to help out those who made this possible.  Because it was not a single effort.   
 Q.  I know you want to enjoy it, but moving forward, how daunting is it thinking of following up one of the greatest seasons ever?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't know right now.   
 Q.  What do you do for an encore?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Hopefully improve.  Get better.  There are places I can get better.  Ball striking-wise, tee ball I can get stronger, I can hit it further, my short game I want to keep consistent, keep exactly where it's at.   
But, yeah, as far as dissecting that, it's a little early.  I'll probably do that a little bit more in the off season and figure out what our weaknesses are.
