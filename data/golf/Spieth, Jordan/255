Q. Four birdies and an eagle, I know you didn't finish the way you wanted to, but just a few comments about the part of the round that you were happy with.
JORDAN SPIETH: I had spoke after the first two days, my short game felt like it was there, and I was searching on my swing.  Figured out that I got into the tendency I typically do get into when it's really wet out, which is I get a little lazy in my load on my back swing.  So I found that out on the practice range today and I struck the ball beautifully today.  Two chip-ins, which obviously helps.  Putter just went cold for me.  And it wasn't bad strokes, I left everything just short.
So, it was a round of what could have been.  It really could have been a 7- or 8-under in this wind and it was one of those special rounds that ended up being 4-under.  But I feel really good about where everything's at, I'm putting the ball nicely, my stroke's where I want it to be, I just didn't adjust to the fact that they were about a foot slower today.  My speed's been fantastic this whole week and balls have just been dying just past the hole or just into the lips and today they were just that half a foot shorter and that was, they were definitely a little bit slower and I didn't make the adjustment.  I didn't really figure it out until around the middle of the round, and then it was a little late.  I had some good options before that.  But again, really solid, 6-under with 6-under almost 7-under through 15 and I'll get those ones back tomorrow.
