JORDAN SPIETH: I had kind of the tugs the first few holes, but every ball was struck solid.  They were just overcurving to the left and I kind of didn't know that was going to happen on the range.  It was a good range session.  But when that happens, it's actually pretty easy for me to fix it.  The other days I was kind of missing on both sides.  It was just kind of the left today, so I was able to hold onto the ball, hold onto the face a little bit to straighten it out and gave myself a lot more putts at birdie.  I think I hit 14 greens today, which is by far the most I hit this week.
Really pleased with the progression that we've made from Thursday in the ball-striking this week.  The putting stayed consistent.  I felt like I've played better each day.
Yeah, it was a really nice finish there on 18.  I'll go down and -- I won't have that many up-and-downs that are harder than that for my career, so it was a nice penny saver, too.
Q. I know you come in and compete every week to win.  What do you take away from this week?
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, it was going to be a big challenge after 16 yesterday.  I just threw myself pretty far back on a course that just doesn't yield seven, eight birdies in a round, which was what I was going to need today.  I had a good opportunity.  The first couple holes, really 1 through 4 or 5, I needed to make some magic happen, and I was 1-over, so what I take from there on was very solid.  4-under on this course when really some of the easy holes were already in the past.  Yeah, I thought we gained a lot of momentum today and momentum through the week.  I thought it was, again, a very nice progression day-to-day and one where I'm now starting to feel very comfortable with my golf swing.
