Q.   You had mentioned the tough holes with the wind.   How much of a fight though -- you had a great score going -- the fight of trying not to get ahead of yourself? 
Did that play at all today?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I looked at the scoreboard.   I knew where I was.   It really -- I don't think it had an affect at all.   It was more just really, really difficult holes and I mean I hit good shots that just -- I was kind of wondering how they went over the green. 
I was hitting punch shots right at the hole and ended up going over the green.   I look back and I don't feel like I ended up finishing the way I did but, you know, there's -- it's disappointing because I really didn't hit the ball that bad.   Just those holes got the best of me.

Q.   There was one hole, I forgot to mark it down, you and Briny were back behind and you punched yours and went down.   What hole was that?
JORDAN SPIETH:   8.

Q.   What did you see there and how did that shot maybe get away from you?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I mean you can't leave it back down where you were.   Mine -- Briny ended up banking it and getting up and down.   That's a really difficult shot.   I felt more comfortable trying to spin it, land it on the fringe and spin it.   Wasn't much that I had.   Just trying to hit the pin, really and --

Q.   It did.
JORDAN SPIETH:   If not, it's going to go by.   I hit the shot how I wanted to.
