 Q. You get to 5 tee box and it just looks kind of like there's no one else around. How weird is that to kind of have a place on the course where it's so quiet back there.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Well it's really 12 and 13 that's so quiet. I mean 5 now you have fans that are back on the tee box. So 12 and 13 it's very unique here to have a couple holes where there are no fans, especially on kind of the most picturesque holes that we play the entire year and there happens to be no fans in some of the biggest moments in our sport's history happen on those holes with no one around the green. It's kind of wild.   
   
 Q. What do you take away from this week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Positives. Really I mean the first round was just a big bummer that first nine, just getting started. If it weren't for that nine holes I probably would have a chance to win today. So I'm proud of kind of the progress I made sticking to kind of the process and I felt like I got to a position today that's felt better than it's been tee to green and even on the greens in quite awhile, so I'm just going to stick with it and hopefully get off to a little better start next week, keep the consistency and have a chance to win.
