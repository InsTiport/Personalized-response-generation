Q. Thoughts on your first round here in the Abu Dhabi HSBC championship?
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, I didn't drive the ball well, which is really the key out here.  So to shoot 4-under with the way I felt with my driver is spectacular.  Yes, I'm very pleased with that.  I need to play the par 5s better.  I had 85 yards into two of them, played them 1-over on our back nine, the front nine, and that's a perfect number for me.  I'm normally looking to make a 4.
I feel like I scrambled pretty well for the majority of the round, and then a couple wedge shots just really hurt me from making it a great round.
Q. You said you had the experience of watching this on TV and that might help; did it?
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, it's very different when you're out here.  The course plays different day-to-day any ways.  But it was just in such spectacular shape.  You have to be in the fairway, so difficult to advance the ball out of this rough and then the greens are rolling about as pure as any I've ever putted on.  It's a beautiful golf course.  It's a great place to start the year, and you know, given a short week coming over from the States, I'm okay with 4-under to start and I'm going to try and improve each round.
Q. It is unusual to have the three big stars right together for the first day; so how was that experience?
JORDAN SPIETH: It was great.  We were saying walking off the last green there, we wish that we could play this group all the time.  It's very rare to get it, so we're soaking it in.  It's fun feeding off each other.  We obviously all watch each other, whether we're playing in tournaments together or not.  Competitive within the group but friendly competitive, you know.
