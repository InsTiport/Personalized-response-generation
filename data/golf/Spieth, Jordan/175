 Q.  How do you feel about playing your way back into this?  
JORDAN SPIETH: A lot better than yesterday for sure.  I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed yesterday.  I woke up and got out here, and I was just -- I was cranky.  I don't know.  I guess we all just kind of have days like that.  The first nine holes being 3-over didn't really help that.  But to stay patient and to get two birdies coming back in, to at least feel like you could do something today, that was big, the back nine yesterday.   
The putter just hasn't quite been there for me in that mid range today.  Fortunately today I hit it close enough times to make up for it.   
 Q.  How tricky was that 2-putt there on the last hole?  
JORDAN SPIETH: At 18?  It was just really tough to get the right speed because I had to go through about eight feet of fairway and then had to just barely get over the slope to have the right pace on it.   
And when I hit it, I hit it shorter than I meant to.  I thought it might be -- I thought I might have left it short.  But once it started to creep over, I knew it was the right speed and it was going to be a little 2-footer up the hill.  But yeah, I had a 5-iron in and I bailed a little on the line.  But I knew if I hit it over on that left side, you can at least cast it down there within five feet.   
 Q.  Like you said yesterday, when you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, is it easy to get over a day like that, as opposed to if something goes wrong, like your putting?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I think so, yeah, because I can consciously fix that with sleep.  Sometimes it's a little tougher when you have to work on something and then trust it on the golf course.  For me it was just a matter of, you know, just stop being cranky.   
I don't know what to tell you.  I was getting more mad at bad breaks than you should.  I was just like -- I just didn't feel -- I felt fine.  I just was -- sometimes everybody has a bad day at the office.  It was a bad day at the office yesterday and a really good one today.  I'm going to need two really good ones again.  But to be within four shots after yesterday's round is a tremendous accomplishment in its own.  Just going to need to keep the birdies coming.   
 Q.  Especially because you pretty much knew what Jon's score was?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I saw his score, it would have been like No. 4 or 5, first time I saw that he was at 9.  Might have even been later than that because I just figured DJ was in the lead after the first two holes and thought we were just kind of gunning down DJ.  Yeah, Jon posted two really solid rounds.   
 Q.  How does a wet golf course change any plans tomorrow?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Well, it's really firmed up right now.  So I imagine -- you're saying when it rains tomorrow?  I imagine it won't make much of a difference on the fairways because it's going to be kind of on top of the grass, so it will be skiddy to start, and I think it's still going to have that firm base.  Sunday will be I think a softer golf course than tomorrow will be if we're playing in the rain.  But the greens will certainly become softer, and they will get back to where they were maybe Wednesday.   
 Q.  Do you get a little extra juice playing with Justin and DJ like you have the last two days?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I enjoy it, yeah, for sure.  I've always loved playing with DJ.  He's been a partner of mine.  Justin, obviously we go way back.  Just a lot to talk about.  Good fun, yeah.  I think we all, you know, enjoyed the pairing when we got it.   
And then we were potentially going to get it again the next couple days, but I think those two will probably be paired together and I wouldn't obviously want to be a stroke back.  But any pairing, you know, everybody really gets along and has a good time together once we start playing together so often.   
 Q.  I'm sure you have huge galleries every week.  What did you think of them today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, they were loud.  They were drunk.  (Laughter).  They were definitely drunk out there.  It felt different than a golf tournament.  It felt like you were at a -- I mean, there were guys yelling at me, "Spieth, J.T.'s better; Spieth, J.T.'s better."  You just never really hear that.   
Normally in a golf crowd, if you like somebody better than someone else, they just root for them;  not actually tell you how they feel about you.   
But it's sports.  I mean, when somebody, opposing team comes in and plays the Dallas Mavericks, I'm yelling at them, so who am I to judge.
