 Q.  You were joking around back there --  
JORDAN SPIETH: There was no joking about that.  We got off to a good start and we played extremely well in the morning together.  And then all of a sudden we just caught fire.  The shot he holed on 6, same number on 7, made birdie there, birdied 8.   
I tried to make sure that we had two putts on every hole, even if I was a little off, to least make sure we had a chance at birdie.   
It was really, really fun to be a part of.  I know he has that in him.  We've all seen it before.  He's Captain America for us.  He wanted to play five matches at the beginning of the week.  Tiger told him he might be sitting one and he said, You are not sitting me on any matches.  We got off to the start in the mornings that we needed to secure a spot in the afternoon.   
Henrick and Justin are an extremely strong team, gold and silver medalists.  Fun to be a part of.  We know we have a lot of work to do.  12 points at stake tomorrow, so a good start tomorrow can carry the momentum.
