Q.   Just talk about the round today? 
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, started off well on the first hole and then I think I had a tough time getting the wind on the holes.   I was hitting the ball further today.   I was striking it really solid and hitting it too far on some holes and it left me in some tough positions.   Just, honestly, I made four bogies in the last two rounds.   Eight bogies total, four in each round, and you just can't do that.   That's just too many mistakes.   I'm trying to push it too far off the tees to give myself wedges when, in reality, with how soft the greens with an 8‑iron it's easier to get it closer, I can worry about the spin.   So got to change my game plan a little for tomorrow. 
Yeah, overall it was just a little up and down.   I really didn't like the pin on 13.   I thought the TOUR did a poor job of placing that pin there, because on my 30‑footer, which I hit a pretty good shot into that green, I had 30 feet.   If I hit it two feet past the hole it's in the water on my putt, so I left it four feet short and missed it and bogeyed the next, so it set me back.

Q.   Still there are like 30 guys within two shots of the lead.   Nobody's run away with it.   You have to be happy going into tomorrow. 
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I think somebody will get to 8, maybe 9.   But, all in all, it's going to take a special round tomorrow, but not too special.   It's out there.   I can do it, and I'll be going off early enough to get in there and make it a scare.
