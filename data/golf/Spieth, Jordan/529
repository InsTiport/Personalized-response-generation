Q.   Jordan, wow, what a round.   You turned at + 3 and then made four birdies on the front-9, your final 9. 
What was the difference when you made that turn?
JORDAN SPIETH:   You know, I wasn't hitting it any better.   I scraped a couple birdies out.   I was in a lot of trouble and found a couple holes near trees to go through and capitalized on the putts and started putting well. 
You know, I was putting all right on my front-9 but just let too many mid-iron shots get away from me.   I was trying to move the ball too much on the green, really just need to hold it low and straight out here in this wind.

Q.   You're a guy that basically had your career launched in part at this tournament a year ago.   What does that experience bring this time around when you come back to play in 2014?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, definitely.   This is a golf course I actually played in Junior Golf as well in a tournament.   It's one of the only courses, one of the three events now that I've come back where I've actually played four PGA TOUR rounds on the golf course.   So that's really nice. 
It's nice to see the same pins and kind of have an idea of where the places are you should miss it and where the best chances to make birdie come from.
