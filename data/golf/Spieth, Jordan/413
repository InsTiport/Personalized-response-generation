 Q.  What a remarkable accomplishment.  What does this championship mean to you?  JORDAN SPIETH: I don't know right now.  I can't seem to wrap my head around the finish of today.  I've tried to think about it since it ended and boy, I feel for Dustin.  It's the same feeling I had on 17; I just was able to have another hole to rebound. I mean, this is incredible.  It's incredible.  It will take a little bit to sink in.  I didn't think this would be over and I would be holding the trophy.  Definitely didn't think that at the time.  Obviously pleased.   Q.  Youngest since Bobby Jones did it in 1923 back-to-back major championships.  That's historic.  JORDAN SPIETH: Thank you.  Yeah, I mean, every single thing that I'm able to do, somebody seems to find a history lesson on why I was the youngest to do something or as young as somebody way back when. For me, this is my life.  I've now been doing it for a while.  I don't really think of my age.  I just think of us all as peers. It's cool to be able to have two legs of the Grand Slam now, and to conquer golf's hardest test.  The U.S. Open is conquering the hardest layout in all of golf.  That's the way every year. The fact that we did it is amazing.  We really grinded this week.  Didn't have my best stuff ball striking at all and we really grinded over those 4- or 5-footers, and that was the difference.   Q.  Amazing story with your caddie being from here as well.  What did that mean for you sharing that moment with Michael?  JORDAN SPIETH: I closed the door and we went away from any cameras when it was happening, when the finish was happening with Michael.  He just said, Dude, be positive.  I was sitting there going, I think Dustin is going to make this, what did I do?  How did I possibly let this happen?  He said, Be positive.  You just never know. I was sitting with him when that second putt missed.  I just -- my eyes were wide looking at the TV screen and he was silent as well.  We didn't really know what to do.  Then got up.  He said, Dude, give me a hug, you did it. It was really cool.  It's amazing.  What a special place for Michael.  He was married here.  He shares arguably one of the best moments of his life here.  I was able to add to that history that he has at Chambers Bay. That was probably the best work Michael has ever done this week to get me through.  At Augusta I was on and making everything and striking the ball fantastic.  He was the one that got me through this week when I wanted to get down when things weren't going well.   Q.  What does "paint the picture" mean?  You said that a couple of times, Michael would say that to you?  JORDAN SPIETH: It means zero in, really focus on the shot, on the target.  In my -- I say "struggles."  It wasn't bad, but I didn't have full control of the golf ball.  When that happens, I start thinking about different things in my swing. Just paint a picture, zero in on the target.  Don't worry about your swing, the ball will go there as long as you focus on it.  That's how it works. He was reiterating that today and yesterday.  That's what we were focusing on is seeing the ball flight, seeing it land, understanding where it's going to roll to.   Q.  Club with Rory McIlroy going to St. Andrews, two players holding all four of the major tournaments.  JORDAN SPIETH: It's kind of cool.  I think to have two players hold the four majors and Ricky having the fifth.  It's awesome that the game is in young hands. I don't think much of a rivalry.  I've said that from the beginning.  I don't think much of a rivalry.  Rory has four majors and dozens of wins and I'm just starting out. Again, I'm certainly quite a bit younger than he is.  I'm just happy to have this and to be chasing that No. 1 spot which he holds.  So I'm certainly focused on that.
