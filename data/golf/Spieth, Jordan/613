 Q.   Obviously not the ideal finish but overall a great week.   At one point yesterday I think you got as high up as the Top 15.   Some comments on the week overall being here.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was exciting.   I gained a lot of confidence from it.   Going in, I've been playing okay, not great but, you know, fortunate enough to get the invite.   
Yeah, yesterday it got really fun and I knew what it was like to be in the Top-5 in a PGA event and a feeling I would like to have again.   So, it didn't end the right way but it was a great week overall.  
   
 Q.   This wasn't your first Tour event, obviously.   Your first Valero Texas Open.   Just some comments about the tournament and everything.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I mean everything just went so smoothly here.   We had delays the first day and still got out there, got plenty of time to finish and, you know, everything just ran the right way.   
It was run -- everyone was really classy and was very, very good to me at least and I know everyone else felt the same way.  
   
 Q.       My last question for you, what do you take away from it, where do you go from here?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Well, like I said, I got a lot of confidence, got a little confidence boost in the tournament.   We have all our college stuff now.   Our post-season, Big 12, National Championships.   
I'm glad to be back and joining the team for that and then can't wait for summer, this summer, should be filled with quite a few tournaments.
