 Q.  Highlights of your week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: The biggest highlight of my week was yesterday, was our comeback with DJ when we were 3-down at the turn and 2-down with -- really 1-down with a couple to go.  That was a huge match, I think obviously for the team, because they were supposed to win that match.  We instead, won that match, not only we tied, we won, but that flipped two points and ended up being a point difference.   
Then that afternoon was the best golf I've played the whole week with Patrick.  Obviously I love pairing up with DJ.  I think that's something that's going to work in the future.  I think we are a great alternate-shot team.  I think we are a good best-ball team, too.  Me and Patrick have some kind of energy together that really works.   
And I really enjoy the team part of this.  That's my favorite part about these matches.  We play individual matches all the time.  We play individual events all the time.  But the team part of this was fantastic this week, and DJ was a new partner, was something new to tryout.  I loved it.   
 Q.  Your match today, didn't go your way.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I should have won.  I should have won this for this team.  I thought on 15 that I may lose us The Presidents Cup with a couple of shots that I hit.  Marc played great golf.  15, I handed it to him, but the other holes that were won were won because one of us won the hole.  And that's the match you want.  You want both of you to play well; you want someone to play a little bit better.   
For a while there, that's how it was.  And then I kind of handed him a hole, almost got it back.  And I did all I could in the last two holes there.   
And Marc Leishman will win a major championship in my mind.  I lost to a really good champion and a solid player.
