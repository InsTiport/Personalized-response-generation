 Q.   Jordan, can you assess your round?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, today I hit it solid.   My putter felt really, really great in this round and I started to putt‑‑ halfway this morning, made a couple putts that went in and got a couple birdies.   Saw the ball go in, and made a good bogey save on my first hole.   
I was thinking about my speed control, hitting very solid on these greens and I was able to control the pace.   
   
 Q.   On 16, a little bit of fire on that‑‑  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Well, yeah, you know what, it was a bad decision off the tee.   If I hit driver on to the green, it's actually a pretty easy up‑and‑down.   Just kind of bailed and didn't play the smart shot, just bad decisions.   If the execution is the problem  inaudible   if I'm going to make bad swings, but just three really bad decisions in a row.   
Yeah, definitely, hitting the tee shot in the bunker on the par5 on 15, but other than that, didn't really have any problems today.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.).   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Just the fact‑‑ make the next event or making a certain amount of points.   Just go out there and get on top of the leaderboard and try to make some birdies.  
   
 Q.   Do you approach tomorrow like any other event, or does it feel different or different mind‑set?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I don't think the wind is going to be up.   I wish it would be.   So hopefully it blows.   The greens are just getting faster and faster.   I know they were faster today, very slick.   Pins will be hard.   
I'm going to have to play smart golf tomorrow, and obviously a round like I shot today is going to be a really good round.   I don't think it ends up winning tomorrow, but I think I go out with the goal to try to hit as many greens as possible and focus on my speed to try to post a few under and see what happens.
