 Q.   [No microphone.]   
    JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, very.   Most difficult part is driving the ball.   Very tight landing, especially on the back nine here.   In the rain, it's just a lot more difficult to maybe release or get the right transition on the ball because you're kind of more focused on holding that club a little tighter.   
    Yeah, it's definitely a lot more difficult.   Those last two holes were really, really hard, same with 13.   But other than that, we actually caught a little break.  
   
 Q.   You played with Henrik.   Obviously, it doesn't happen often on tour where guys distance themselves.   What did you see that he was doing that the other guys aren't right now?   
    JORDAN SPIETH:   He's not hitting a bad shot.   He made a couple of bogeys somehow, but even when he was in trouble, found a way to make saves.   
    So all in all, very impressive what he's doing.   He's hitting that 3 wood for the most part right down the middle of the fairway.   From there, it's easy golf for him.
