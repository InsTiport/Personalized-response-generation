Q.   If you could explain to people how difficult it is to close out one of these matches, how would you do that? 
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it is difficult.   Yeah, it's just putting them away, and you feel the nerves just like you would on an opening tee shot or anything else, and really, the pressure is on us to putt them away and they are kind of freeâ€‘wheeling it because their backs are up against the wall and we are probably playing a little bit more conservative.   It's always tough, but we've got it done and we are onto a couple matches today.

Q.   What are some of the challenges having to sleep on a lead and coming back early in the morning trying to close it out? 
JORDAN SPIETH:   I think it's easier than if we were down but all in all we were in a tough position on 15 there.   I just knew if I got it on the green anywhere in the right tee you would make the putt so got it to dorm my there and from there on in, just had to make a par on one of the last three.   Like he said, play a little too conservative but all in all I hit a couple putts that didn't leave him exactly what he wanted to close out the match, but we got the job done.   But you know, sleeping on a lead is a little easier than sleeping trying to come from behind.
