 Q.  Some comments on your round today?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Am I the pre-Phil interview?   
(Laughter.)  Boy, I'm hitting it great now.  I drove the ball spectacular.  I kind of fixed a little something in my driver, 3-wood, long irons, after the round yesterday, and then before the round today.   
I feel very, very comfortable ball striking.  I just couldn't get it in the hole.  I've struggled putting here at Monterrey Peninsula the past few years.  The hardest greens to putt, in my opinion, because they're the softest.  I had a couple putts today that I pretty much started walking in from eight to 10 feet, and then they just kind of dive off or bounce off and lip out.  It just happens.  Sometimes they go in and you think they might miss, sometimes they miss when they're good putts on poa annua.  It doesn't matter where you are.   
Speed control needs to improve to have a chance with these putts to drop.  But I go to Pebble Beach tomorrow.  If I hit the ball the same way, and I can really take advantage of par-5s, then it should be a low round still in the arsenal this week.   
 Q.  What about the week?  How do you view where you are going into the weekend?  
JORDAN SPIETH: My game feels great.  I'm playing much better than I'm scoring.  As long as I kind of focus on that, I'm in good shape.  I feel great about my chances for a low score this weekend and especially next week on a course that I'm even more comfortable on.   
But I'm going to try and do my best to still -- I mean honestly, I'm only seven back and on Pebble, you get a couple good low rounds, and you never know with conditions out here, I'm still in this tournament.   
But what's really killed me this week is the way I've played the par-5s.  I've been in such great position, I'm 1-under on the par-5s.  And from where I've been at, I played them, they have pretty much all been par-4s for me, so it almost feels like I'm playing them 7-over.  It's bizarre, normally, I play the second shots on the par-5s so well, but I haven't found any of the greens and I haven't been strong with my chipping.   
So you got to chip the ball close here, because no putt is good on poa annua greens.  But I go to Pebble where I kind of feel maybe most comfortable, and I'll enjoy that stretch of 4 through 10 on the most beautiful scenery in all of golf, and hopefully make some more putts.
