 Q.   Can you just talk about your round, please?   You're in great position.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   Solid round tee to green I felt like today was one of my best ball‑striking days I've had in a long time.   Wasn't worried, just one little swing thought that I've been having the whole week, and from there drove the ball a lot better today as far as striking it on the middle of the face and put myself in a lot of great positions to make birdies, and there were quite a few wedges that I didn't, but I definitely stole a few on top of that.   Very stress‑free, and I'd like to have a round like that the next two days.   
   
 Q.   How do you explain your success on courses where first‑timers aren't supposed to play well like Augusta and here?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I don't know.   I didn't know that.   Every course I've played over the past few years has been a brand new course to me.   It's only this year am I seeing places a second time.   Even junior to college golf, I only played a year in college, so I only saw those courses once.   It's nothing new.   I played a junior event here a long time ago, but not in the same setting or with the same game.   I don't see that it's necessarily a first‑time thing.   It's just normal.  
   
 Q.   You made birdies on 7 and on 14, which are two of the more difficult par‑4s out here.   Was that just because you're so confident in your ball‑striking right now?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Well, 7 I hit a drive up there to where I could kind of just punch a pitching wedge.   I only had 125 to the hole to that front pin.   That made it a little easier with a good lie and a good wind for me.   I just hit it below the hole there.   
And then 14, that was unexpected.   I hit a good drive up there again, but I had the same 6‑iron I had on 13 from 185 with a little into, off‑the‑left wind, so that's just a perfect number to just rip it, playing about 192 or so, and it drew in there nicely.   I was aimed up a little right and overdid it just a touch, but I got away with it.
