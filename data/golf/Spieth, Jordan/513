 Q.   Can you kind of sum up your round for us today?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I had a lot of good looks.   No.1, you obviously want to get off to a good start and I had to work for a par.   But I didn't think I was out of it.   I had a lot of really good chances.   I hit some really good putts that just didn't quite go in.  
It's been kind of a thing for me when I'm getting close, but I just‑‑ I don't put it on anything other than my speed and reach just aren't matching.   I'm hitting them a little too firm.  
I had a lot of good chances.   Very easily could have won this golf tournament today, even from far behind, which is positive going forward.   Had a great crowd, had a lot of fun today.   Loved playing alongside Aaron.   I've had him in the past.   He's very positive.   Easy guy to play with.  
Yeah, I mean, to only have two birdies with all the looks that I had is one thing I draw from today.   And just get up to next week and get on the greens and make sure my putting is there.  
   
 Q.   Talk about how competitive this weekend has been.   You've looked at this leaderboard, it's changed like crazy.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, it's going to.   Yeah, you play another 18 holes after this, it's still going to do it.   It just 2 happens to be the one ahead after 18 today.   I thought it was going to take about 7‑under for me to pull it off.   And it looks like 10‑under may be good enough, which I had enough chances to do.   But with the great players left out there, you'll see some more birdies coming in.   But there are plenty of pin positions that are going to fool some people.  
It will be interesting to see how it ends up.   It should be very exciting.   
   
 Q.   I saw you handing your gloves and a ball to the kids that were down there in the gallery.   Can you just talk about when you used to come out to these tournaments and the guys you looked up to?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I remember being out here at the Colonial only three years ago or so watching, which is pretty funny.   But, yeah, the kids have been phenomenal.   They show up in Under Armour hats and stuff.   And follow around, cheer us on.   After every hole they want a golf ball.   If I give them all away, I get disqualified (laughter).  
It is a lot of fun to see the kids out.   And helping and helping to grow the game here in DFW.  
   
 Q.   Jordan, another solid week here at Colonial, how would you size up your game for the U.S. Open?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   It's good.   It's a work‑in‑progress.   This week, early on this week, I saw my instructor and we put a game plan in for The Open and we knew that things might be difficult these next couple of weeks to get nailed down as far as my swing goes.   I would be working on it.   I don't have full control over the ball.   And I still had a chance.  
So I struck the ball very, very well as the week went on today.   I started to hit it better and better and make better decisions son this golf course.   So, yeah, I mean I think it's right on track heading into the next few weeks here with my eye on the Open just trying to get everything right then.
