Q. I know you didn't have your best today.  How good does it feel to be able to put an under-par round on the board?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, really good.  When I walked off of 12 green, I'm sitting there going, man, how do I squeeze through and make pars the rest of the round, and now when I finished I wished I had two more birdies.  It was a nice turnaround those last six to gain some momentum.  Really wish I would have cashed the one on 18 but I just never really got comfortable over the putt.  But yeah, when you're really fighting, recently those have been my 2- or 3-over rounds that have thrown me out of the tournament.  To shoot 2-under on this golf course and probably actually improve my position from when I started the round, that's a positive.  I mean, that should give me momentum.
Q. When you have those doubts like with your swing and you said you didn't feel comfortable over putts today, what you did today with that under-par round, could that maybe be a small turning point for you?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I mean, I'm still -- well, I'd like to think -- I wish it were an off day when things were feeling good versus when things haven't really been feeling great and then it was worse today.  But I mean, it's a process coming back.  Anytime I get a chance on the weekend and especially anywhere near contention to kind of see where things are, then I'm able to make adjustments and improve from there.  I'm very pleased with the position I'm in given the way things have felt.
Q. When you are struggling maybe a little early in the round, how hard is it not to let doubt creep into your mind?
JORDAN SPIETH:   It can be hard when it's been something that's the norm, when you've kind of been fighting through things for a while.  I did just a way better job today than I did last Friday.  It's eerie how similar of a position I was in through say eight or nine holes, through 27 holes of each tournament, and I felt like I just stayed so calm, collected; just whatever comes at me, shrug it off, take some punches and wait for your opportunities versus really getting, like you said, down on yourself and upset like I did last Friday, and it led to a missed cut.  I can take a lot out of that for sure.
