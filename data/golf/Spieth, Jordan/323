 Q.  Thanks for joining us on the PGA TOUR Live.  It was a bit of a tough one out there for you today.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it was.  I was really looking to gain some momentum today and kind of halted it.   
 Q.  The conditions of the golf course are obviously different.  Couple more days here over the week.  I'm sure you're going to try to get your game back.  What are you going to be working on to get it back in shape?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I got to putt better.  I'm losing a couple strokes back to the field on putting and normally we're gaining strokes.  Inside 10 feet I got to be solid and confident.  I can't get into a rhythm.  I'm stepping off putts.  That's a tough feeling, you know, kind of bleeds into the rest of your game, too, because you feel like you got to be more aggressive.  So, it really comes down to the putter for me.  I have to get better before next week.  I got to get more comfortable, find a set-up position that I feel like is going to produce the correct start lines.   
 Q.  You described your form going into the Masters, no?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It's tough to say.  It's so early.  We still have what, five days or so, so I've got a couple more competitive rounds and then a few more practice days.   
 Q.  How did the wind affect you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was tough.  The course played tougher.  It's very difficult with this north wind.  I played it with this wind quite a few times now.  I just -- I felt like I was hitting it very well to start the day, everything seemed fine, and then I just kind of made a mistake on 3 with my first putt and it just kind of all tumbled down from there.   
 Q.  How close are you from where you want to be at this stage?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I'm close.  It's the dumb stuff, like I mean two water balls on par 5.  There's four shots.  Those holes are playing at 4.5 today and I had played them with two 6s.  There's four strokes right there.
