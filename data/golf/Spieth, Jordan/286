Q. Jordan, your round today, 2 under, reasonably happy?  I mean, you made five or six birdies.  That's got to be a good sign.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I putted the ball great.  I felt awesome on the greens.  Just missed a lot of greens.  I just hit -- didn't have great control of the ball today, but I think it's close.  Just didn't get off to a good start on the first few holes striking, and from there, it got me thinking about stuff.
But my putter made up for it for the most part.  To shoot 1 under on my front nine, the back nine, was by far the best that I could have possibly shot.  So scoring well, and brought it over to the front a little.  Almost got some momentum, but hopefully we'll be fine.
Q. Was there any particular place in the round where you thought, okay, I've just turned this round around a bit?  Was it towards the beginning of the back nine?  The one on 16?
JORDAN SPIETH: The one on 16 was a nice bonus.  I just hit a really poor iron shot and hit it up in a really tough spot.  Just kind of hacked it out there just to kind of take 4, and it happened to go in.  That was a big momentum kind of keeper.  I played 17 and 18 pretty well, yeah.
