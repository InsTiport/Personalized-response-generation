  BILL MACATEE:   70 today.   How big was that putt at the 18th after the double at 17? 
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was huge.   Just to see one go in after the disappointment there on 17 where I probably should have just hit 3‑wood off the tee.
But that up and down I don't recommend ever hitting it there.   That wasn't easy.   It was kind of maybe one in five, if you make a putt.
So very pleased with having that putt roll right in, gave some momentum.
BILL MACATEE:   You said when we stood here a year ago that the runner up finish just made you hungry to get back.   How often have you thought about this week over the last year?
JORDAN SPIETH:   All the time.   We always think of Masters week.   This is the greatest week in our sport.   And, you know, last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.   I've been looking to get back, looking at trying to get some revenge on the year.   I've got a long way to go still.
BILL MACATEE:   Did it feel a little different today than it did the first two days?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I think so.   Felt a little different because I played in the morning yesterday.   I had a long time.   I had 24 hours from the time I finished to the time I teed off.   That's a long time to sit on a lead like that.
Now we're finishing in the evening, it may help just to get back, get some rest, and be ready for tomorrow.
But, yeah, out on the course it felt a little bit different.   And maybe got a little anxious at times.   But all‑in‑all kept it together with the putter.
