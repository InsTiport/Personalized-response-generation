 Q.  Jordan, how would you assess the week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I thought it was a good, solid week, just needed some better wedge -- like the easy shots, the wedges out of the fairways, and kind of par-3 game.  Just my approach game out of the good lies.  When I hit fairways, it needs to be tightened up.  That was the difference for me this week for having a chance to win today.   
 Q.  Is there a point during the final round today where you felt like it was getting away from you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, through three or four holes I thought unless something special happens, I mean, I'd already gone to like five down or something, five or six down on this golf course at that point.  So I wasn't necessarily trying to win today, I was trying to just go out and shoot a number, and if it was good enough, great.  I wasn't really going to do much scoreboard watching, and I didn't.  Knowing this north wind was going to be tough, trying to make a couple of birdies on each side, which wouldn't be enough anyways.   
 Q.  Do you feel the last few weeks -- have you felt different, or have the results just been different, a combination?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No, I felt very different, yeah.  I've put a lot of work in the game.  It's felt like -- it wasn't like I felt the same standing on the tee January and February as now.  It's totally different.  And there's still quite a bit of work to do.  I know showing up with essentially B game tee to green, on and around the greens I've got it right where I wanted it.  In order to get it to A, keep doing the same things, it just needs more reps.   
 Q.  Going back to a course you won, event where you won?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I'm pleased to have this week off but still be coming off a four-week stretch pretty soon into the event, I feel like I need the week to rest and I need some quality reps on the range.  And at the same time I feel like it's still pretty close to when I just played a lot of golf and made progress and gained a lot of momentum.   
I feel good about it going in.  It will be a golf course I never played before, to be honest.  What we play in February is not the same as what we're about to see.  There's going to be a massive adjustment on what clubs to hit off tee and how we are going to attack the golf course.  Having won there is always nice.   
 Q.  Thinking back to when you became No. 1 for the first time, do you remember that being a different feeling in terms of expectations you had or people had before you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No, I think it felt like a goal accomplished.  It was really satisfying.  But it wasn't like a totally different feeling.  And it's not something that -- it's not a goal of mine anymore.  It's not like I set being No. 1 -- if I take care of what I want to take care of, if I want to accomplish the other goals that I want to accomplish, that comes with it.  But it's not -- I reached it, and it was a goal of mine as a little kid.  And I'm kind of on the rise from kind of a trough, and it feels good to be on the rise.  It feels good to have some momentum.   
 Q.  Do you feel close to that?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It's because I'm compared to a level I can't possibly be at day in and day out.  Right now I feel like I am close, yeah, to being able to -- right now I've been in a position come Sunday the last three weeks of having a chance to probably do something special and win.  But that out front, in full control is close.  And I haven't been there any of these weeks and still had a chance for a special round Sunday to get it done.   
This is where I like to be.  I feel like I didn't play fantastic golf this week by any means, and in top-10 and had a chance to win.  That's where I'd like to live week to week, and then when it is on, I'm out in front.   
 Q.  Is a big Sunday the next step for you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Not necessarily.  If you just look at scoring, the Sunday at the PGA was 1-over, but if you look at it -- if you just put that score maybe here in the same position, it was really a 5-, 6-under type round.  So I had that in a major two weeks ago.   
So I don't feel like it's necessary.  I don't doubt my ability.  It's not like the moments -- it's just simply, just progress.  And today I missed three greens with wedges, two different rounds.  And then shots off par-3s -- the stuff that I normally really dial in is -- the timing is just a little bit off, but it's very close.  With those shots being improved, I'm right up there with a chance.
