 Q.  No problem, just a birdie here at the 9th to begin your day?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, after hitting the fairway we knew we had 86 yards with the same exact wind that's on the driving range, so I just went and hit the shot probably 20, 30 times before going out, hit some putts around where I thought I'd have a mid-ranger from, and it was obviously a different lie than what you have on the range, a little upslope, but that's a good number for me.  I was able to punch a lob wedge in there and get closer than what I thought.   
 Q.  What did you think of Jason's shot?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was a bit weak.  Yeah, it was a bit weak.  I mean, for a 59, being able to place it in the rough and softer greens, you know, you would have liked to see a better chance.  But I've come to expect not great things from him lately, so didn't really surprise me.   
 Q.  Yeah, it's not like he made a hole-in-one in the round or anything, right?  
JORDAN SPIETH: That's the only way I could win a hole today.   
 Q.  Last time you made a hole-in-one you weren't old enough to buy drinks.  Were you able to celebrate?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I was.  We were in Puerto Rico; I think it's 18.  Yeah, this time -- there will be something for you guys today.  Last night actually I was trying to take the tab and Justin Thomas took it from me.  What are you going to do.   
 Q.  Just a comment on Evans Scholars, the scholarship that is given out; is that something that you're able to comment on?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.  I think it's fantastic.  I didn't know that was there.  Not that anyone would ask because you don't really expect to make hole-in-ones, but it's really cool.  It was cool to present it and have two Evans Scholars here.  I became aware of the Evans Scholarship when I was introduced to the Western Am when I was, I think, 15 or 16, and learned about it then from the Western Golf Association.  I think it's one of the cooler golf organizations around the country to be able to give kids who may not be able to have a chance to have, or at least would be in a lot of student debt, a chance to kind of work for it from the ground up and be presented with it by earning it themselves.  So it's cool to just be a small part of that.   
 Q.  How difficult is it for you to stay within yourself playing with the guy.  You went through it at Whistling Straits, you went through it with Dustin Johnson at the British Open.  Is it increasingly difficult for you?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It is definitely challenging.  It's something that I struggled with.  The attitude has struggled the last two tournaments where he gets up 3-under in the first four or five holes in a tournament that we play, and it's like the courses are hard.  It's just hard to stay patient when you see somebody -- Bubba is 6-under to start New York and Jason is 4 or 5 early into the back nine and then I try and force some stuff because I'm like, hey, there's birdies out there.  Normally my game revolves around being patient, being able to make some putts to get into a rhythm.  I just wasn't doing that, seeing the scores around me.  It was tough.  Today I was kind of laughing at it.  It was a different approach.  When I saw the first few holes, by the time he made his putt on 13 to go 3-under through 4, I've got a putt for birdie to get back to even.  I stayed patient, just kind of laughed it off.  This is what he's doing right now, and just try and play my game, and that was the difference.  I made a couple mistakes where I really cost myself two shots on one swing on the drivable hole, and also the three-putt before that, and that was exactly what happened the last couple tournaments, and I didn't bounce back from it.  I think this little -- coming in with a more positive vibe, just arriving on the premises and trying to smile a bit more helped me to react a little bit differently this time.
