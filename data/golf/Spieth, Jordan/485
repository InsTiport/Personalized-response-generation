 Q.  Sorry for the result.  What kind of turned the match in your opinion?  JORDAN SPIETH: Well, I kind of had a good first putt, it went by the hole.  Then I missed my 3-, 4-footer, 4-footer coming back on a hole where I really just needed to make par.  He had par. When that one missed there, I went to 2-up and I still thought I was just fine.  He went to the next hole and the hole after I missed another short one. Once we got back to all square with obviously the momentum and the crowd on his side, he kept on rolling with it.  I made a good birdie on 14 to halve the hole, and then my driver just fell off.  My driver -- I didn't hit the fairways when I needed to today on the back nine after playing a really solid front nine. I hit my drives average on the front nine, but I was hitting really solid second shots and putts.  And then I just got a little tentative on the greens on the back and he took advantage of it.   Q.  Was the tentativeness just a case of some Ryder Cup pressure first time in singles?  JORDAN SPIETH: Sure, there's always the tentativeness when the momentum is on someone else's side, and you just got to get over it.  Some of the reads I just didn't trust or I just left it short.  The green speeds have been -- I left a lot of putts short this whole week, so that just kind of continued today.   Q.  Mission was accomplished early on with getting a good start.  Obviously felt good starting the match?  JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, felt fine.  Good save on 1 and then got up to 2-up through 3, and eventually 3-up through 5.  Had a putt to go to 4-up through 7.  That one missed and then birdied two in a row to stay 3-up.  I thought everything was rolling just fine, just needed to play solid golf and I just didn't have it.   Q.  What are your feelings right now?  JORDAN SPIETH: I'm very disappointed.  I feel like I left my team down. They put me out there first, out there with a full amount of trust to get the job done.  And I put red on the board early like they wanted me to, I didn't finish the match for my team
