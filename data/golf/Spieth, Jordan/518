 Q.   Talk about your round.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Just was an off day.   It's going to happen, just unfortunate here.   Still trying to figure something out, driving the ball, so tough to attack from bunkers, trees and rough and that's kind of what it was today.   
   
 Q.   Saturday a year ago you talked about sometimes trying too hard here, wanting to‑‑  
JORDAN SPIETH:   That wasn't necessarily it, I just didn't have in my opinion, chances to go with pins.   No. 1 I hit a good shot and had a good rough, hit a good putt, it broke, I didn't think it was and after that I didn't have another look until 5, 6, were long distance, 7, I didn't have enough close birdie chances.   
I wasn't trying too hard, I just‑‑ the bunkers are placed perfectly for when I'm not driving the ball well, I can't quite carry them so therefore on the lips of a lot of fairway bunkers and didn't make it around the corners on other holes so just an off day.   
   
 Q.   Talk about 14.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I had a tough wide down there, I didn't want to pitch at this point and tried to be aggressive.   I don't regret the shot at all, just the last time I looked up I tried to go closer to the tree and that was the issue.   It's a tough lie, seemed like it was buried down in the rough there, when it wasn't very thick rough.   In that sense it was a hard shot, but, you know, if it's a foot left or foot right when it comes out, then it misses the tree but it went right into the tree and I was dead from there.   
   
 Q.   How disappointed are you going into the final round?   
>> Very, yeah, very disappointed.   It's tough to swallow today's round.   We had good conditions and I was confident going in and had a good warm‑up session this morning so just have to sit back and work on a few things.   I don't need to think too much about it, just come out tomorrow and trying and low early and hopefully the wind picks up.   
   
 Q.   When you have a tough hole how do you feel you handle putting it behind you and moving forward?   Do you have a hard time with that?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, I don't think so.   I think I'm getting better at that.   Each shot I'm better.   I have a history of starting off poorly on the first four or five holes on this golf course all the way for the past four years, very rarely do I start under par for the first five holes and they just don't fit my eye.   So hopefully tomorrow I get a couple of putts to go early and can run with it when I reach the holes that I do take advantage of.   
   
 Q.   What's the goal for Sunday?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   59.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Thank you.
