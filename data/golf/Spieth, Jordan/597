Q.   Just give us some quick thoughts on the ending here.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, at the beginning of the round I had told Michael that I think I was going to have to shoot six.   So I told him after each hole let me know how many I need left.   And got to 5‑under through 10 there and thought that maybe I would need to get at 21 or so.   Those guys were at 21, 22 at the time. 
You know, I tried to play conservative golf, tried to hit the greens, give myself eight chances after No. 10, eight looks at birdie.   And you know, just one short.   Didn't get up‑and‑down on 15 or 16, and it cost me. 
But all in all, obviously I'm real excited with how the week ended, and I would have taken second at the beginning of the week if you told me. 
It was cool to battle on the back nine there and know that I was close in the heat and feel the pressure.   First‑time experience for me.

Q.   Top 10 you'll be into next week.   What's your thoughts on continuing out here?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   I just played three in a row, so I'm pretty worn out.   I may sleep for a couple of days and get out there and just try and keep on riding the momentum and see what happens. 
Coming in here I was hitting the ball well and struggling a little with the putter, and now I've come out of it knowing that my stroke's a lot better.   I feel really confident for the rest of the year.
