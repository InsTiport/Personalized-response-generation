Q. Quite the eventful middle part of the round.  You really got things going.  Just a few comments about the day so far.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it's a very interesting day, one where I saw a bit of what I saw the last couple tournaments in that any time I gained momentum I just kind of tossed it back and played 14 and 15 -- when I hit the green on 14 in two, I played those holes 1-over.  Really should have been at least 1-under.  So to bounce back from that then and get that spark off the hole-in-one and then the chip-in, to then play No. 4 solid, 7 solid, really this is the nine holes that I needed to really feel confident and comfortable and back on track.
Q. The hole-in-one gets one lucky person a year, through Quicken Loans, that's got to be --
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, that's very cool, and there's a scholarship, I think, given here.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  It's a really cool deal what's going on with Quicken Loans.  I'd be happy to help four times a round if I could.  It's nice to get one, and hopefully it goes to somebody who needs it.
Q. How comfortable were you on the greens?  I didn't see a whole lot of your round early.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, average.  I came in, I'm not extremely confident in putting right now, had average practice sessions this week.  I've tried to work on it pretty hard, but just haven't really found a right rhythm.  I made a couple good par saves today, though, and I missed a shorter length birdie putt that hooped out all the way around the hole, which is kind of a tough break.  But all in all, it's almost there.  It's getting close.
