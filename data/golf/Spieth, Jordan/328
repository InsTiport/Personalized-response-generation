 Q.  You're a huge sports fan.  You are playing a pseudo home game.  You went to Texas.  You had the largest galleries by far.  In this individual sport, can you feed off crowds in this sport like you can in team sports?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yes, I think you can.  It certainly doesn't hurt to have this kind of support.  Michael was saying before the round started, hey, we're going to have nice crowds today and feed off that momentum, they'll be rooting for us, whether up or down.  It was nice to get off to a good start and kind of get everyone going.   
As we got to this back nine here on the water, it was awesome, massive crowds.  And Justin and I both enjoy playing in front of you of that.   
 Q.  Speaking of Justin, he's a very good friend of yours.  You've known each other for a very, very long time.  What's it like playing against him in a format like this?  
JORDAN SPIETH: It was a bit odd.  I like being on his team.  And hopefully we'll team up in a lot of events going forward.  It was a bit of an odd scenario, we've played against each other a couple of times in the past, but we're always rooting for each other.  Now we're in a tricky situation.  I know he wanted to beat me pretty bad.  And that made it a tough match for us.   
And we just kind of had our game today to start the round once again.  And jumping off to a 3-up lead early on the front nine for the third straight day takes a lot of stress off.  I need to be a little more disciplined as we get in the middle of this back nine.   
 Q.  For the third straight day you got off to a quick start, that just excited the fans and I bet there was a lot of adrenaline pumping out there?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, for sure.  I woke up this morning with some nerves, knowing that no matter what Justin was going to be a tough opponent.  I knew I pretty much had to win or tie this match.  Even after playing so great the first two days, it still felt like it was a win or go home, you don't want to rely on a playoff.   
It was a great start, birdieing one and two.  Seeing a putt go in on one and another on two, gets kind of a nice feel for your nerves with your putting stroke.  And I think that's very important to see a couple of putts go in early, jump off to four or five birdies there on the front nine, really put him behind.   
 Q.  You talked to we talked about course management.  Are you happy with the progress on the course?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, for sure.  We seem to have our kind of edge back with that, seemed to have lost it for a few events, seems like we're ready to go now and we really feel like this is leading up into Augusta.  We're going to play hard and grind.  And luckily in match play you feel nerves on most every swing, versus a regular Thursday, Friday round.  And I think that -- I say luckily, because I think it's good when you're trying to prepare for a major.  Yeah, we're pleased with where the game is at.   
 Q.  Birthday party in the Spieth household tonight?  
JORDAN SPIETH: No, it was yesterday.  So we had dinner last night.
