Q.   (No Microphone.)
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was an incredible experience.   It was one that I always wanted to have.   I've always dreamt about it.   As a little kid, I always dreamed of playing at Augusta on Sunday and closing out the Tournament. 
I got off to the start I wanted to and then they just didn't fall.   Couple bounces here, couple bounces there, a ball flies further on nine, ball flies a little further on 12 and it's a different story.   But to know I was that close and really performed mentally better than I could have anticipated, that's very reassuring going forward. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
JORDAN SPIETH:   I learned that I actually can have patience.   That's something I've been struggling with when in these kind of positions.   That's why I don't think I've won more when I've had a chance to.   I think this week I proved to myself that if I can go in with that kind of attitude that I'll be successful more often than not. 
Ultimately, Bubba played some incredible golf.   Hat's off to him.   It wasn't going to be a whole lot I could do, unless I played a flawless round, even after being a few under.   So he deserved it, 8â€‘under on this golf course was a number that I thought would be difficult to achieve after the first couple days.   He found a way to do it.   So hat's off to him. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, they're my peers and it's been kind of an honor to get to play with and against guys that I've grown up watching, grown up really trying to emulate a lot of parts of their games.   I feel that I am ready to win on this kind of stage and that's really cool, regardless of age, first time here, I think that this, I can see why even when you're playing your A game why it's difficult for a first time winner to pop up here, because it's just so hard with the subtleties of the greens and it may have made a difference by about three shots during the week. 
No excuses.   I couldn't have imagined a better week.   Bubba knew where to go, Bubba hit wedge into 13 and when he had wedge into 13 I said, okay, well this is pretty ridiculous.   So I knew it would be pretty hard from there.   He just played some very, very solid golf.   But, yeah, to answer your question, it is nice to have the respect of the guys that I've always looked up to.
