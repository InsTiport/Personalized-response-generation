Q. Not the way you wanted to start, right?
JORDAN SPIETH: That's right.
Q. Never could get in any rhythm, you feel like?
JORDAN SPIETH: Just an off day.  Played a really good opponent.  Plays a simple game.  Point A to Point B.  He only made one mistake all day.  I didn't capitalize on the opportunities that I had early.  I was a little behind the eight ball and just didn't have my best stuff.
Q. What part of your game were you happiest with today?
JORDAN SPIETH: I liked my wedge play.  I thought my control of the ball, my flighting on a few shots was really nice.  I've been working on that.  Different trajectories, I need that in a couple of weeks.  I was pleased with that.
Q. Do you feel better after the range?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, a bit.  We've got a good game plan going forward.  At this point I can't control my own destiny.  Whatever we work on is with eyes towards improving the next couple of rounds and then into next week and trying to get better each day.
Q. Talk about 5 and 6.
JORDAN SPIETH: I missed one on five and then the one on 6 was 12 or 15 feet.  That's like less than half percent or so.  I will miss a lot of those going forward and I'll make some going forward.  Yeah, I missed an opportunity on 5 to take a 1-up lead.  I knew I still would have plenty of chances.  I hit quite a few greens in regulation until the end of the round.
Tomorrow is going to be windy.  I look forward to striking it well.  Giving myself as many greens in regulation as possible, therefore, take some stress off the putter.  You are going to have some putts that go in that you think miss and some putts that miss that you think are going in on a day like tomorrow with tricky greens and heavy winds.
Q. What did you want to work on when you got to the range?
JORDAN SPIETH: We're just adjusting minor things.
Q. Your mentality after a loss as opposed to a number you are not happy with, what does that do for getting ready the next day?
JORDAN SPIETH: A number?
Q. As a score, like in stroke play?
JORDAN SPIETH: Oh, I probably would have been more upset at what score I would have posted today if it were just a regular World Golf Championship event.  It would have potentially been my worst score of the season.  It probably would have been.  I don't know if I would have ended up shooting the same score if that were the case.
At this point I'm rooting for a Ryan Moore victory tomorrow.  If he wins tomorrow, then I can control my own destiny on Friday.  I obviously have to take care of my end of the bargain tomorrow as well.
Q. How important is it for you to make it to the weekend?
JORDAN SPIETH: Certainly the goal.  It's not live or die.  Certainly what I'm trying to do when I'm here.  I will still be able to breath and sleep and have my family there and everything if I'm not here on the weekend.  I've got hopefully plenty of opportunities in this tournament going forward.  At this point I'm very optimistic about my chances going forward this week.
Q. Did that second shot on 15 surprise you a little?  Just jump a bit?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I caught a gust of wind.  Hit a pitching wedge and a 170 yards there and I normally hit it 140.  Obviously, it hit the downslope.  When I struck it, before it reached its apex, it had picked up a gust of wind.  At that point I knew it was flying pin high which was too far.
