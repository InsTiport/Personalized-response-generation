Q. We've seen you put a lot of better numbers out there.  If you look back on your round, what do you think was missing for you today?
JORDAN SPIETH: Putting.  The longest putt I made was the one on 18, and then wedge play.  Just distance control on my scoring clubs there, when I had anywhere from 120 yards and in.  So stuff that normally comes around with enough work.
So I think as I started to get a little tentative with them, didn't want to throw it behind holes.  So be a little more aggressive, why not, the next few days.
Q. Tomorrow do you need to play with a different strategy?
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, looking at the board right now, it's somewhere in the low 20s probably for the winning score.  Try and shoot 7 (under) each day.  It's certainly easier said than done, but we've also done it here before.  And the course is gettable enough to do so.
Going to need some putts to go and some closer wedge play.  But our goal will be to try and shoot 7-under each day coming in to try to get to like 22 and see if it's good enough.
