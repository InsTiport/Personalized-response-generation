 Q.   Down here yet again with Jordan Spieth.   Seemed to be making a habit of this.   Really a great run out of today, Jordan.   You can't be too unhappy about the way you played.   Maybe not quite the shot you wanted at 18.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   The biggest thing is to stay below the hole.   I actually had a perfect number to where if I did catch it pure it might hit the back ridge and come back.   Caught it a little thin.   The fairways are really wet, downslope, maybe just bailed a touch but left it in a good spot to get in at 4.   I knew I was tied.   Wanted to play more golf.  
   
 Q.   I know you got better things to do than stand here talking to me.  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Always.   Always.
