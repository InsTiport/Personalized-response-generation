 Q.  Jordan, just a comment on your day out there if you can.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, not great.  Yeah, I just kind of lost the swing a little bit and I got some tough breaks.  Really did.   
I had couple plug lies, couple divots early in the round that I made a couple bogeys off from birdie positions.  Then from there just kind of hard to stay motivated, I guess.  Made some birdies coming in; double on the back.  Guy yells, Mashed potatoes right at impact, and I snapped it and it hits a rock and goes out of bounds.  Just that kind of stuff that happened a little bit this weekend on the break side of things that held me back.   
But the game, I thought that although I didn't -- my result wasn't fantastic, this was progressively better through the bag.  I'm in a new driver and 3-wood that aren't spinning at all, so I'm going to go back to my old stuff next week until I find one that's optimized.   
 Q.  What's the first thing that comes to your mind about Shriners and Las Vegas experience and your tournament overall?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I thought that hospitality and really the way that the kids from the hospital we really incorporated into the week was fantastic.  I thought it was incredible to have standard bearers from the hospital and the way that they were able to incorporate it on the range and then throughout the practice rounds, the pro-ams, really makes it a special week for sure.   
 Q.  What's the best thing you take away from your game this week?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Overall, just the improvement in moving the right direction, especially around the short game.  This was kind of a trial run with stuff I've been working on for only about a week and a half.   
It was solid.  I'll go into next week confident.  I played a lot better than I scored, be and that happens sometimes.
