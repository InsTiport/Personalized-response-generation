Q. Jordan, that's a back-9 finish that carries a lot of momentum into Saturday, I would imagine.
JORDAN SPIETH: For sure.  I've just been searching with the swing and started to kind of get a good feel towards really the 14th hole was a big hole for me.  Kind of just hacked it around 10, 11, made it work but 14 I started to have kind of a really good finally emotion where I knew the ball was going to launch when I hit it.
I was able to close with 3 birdies in the last 5 holes.  All in all, you know, I need probably to go somewhere around 10-under on the weekend but certainly I have the fire power to do it.
Q. The putter is as hot as it is now, how does that help trying to figure out on the range?
JORDAN SPIETH: It's just if I hit greens, I think I'll get the job done, which is great.  I feel very confident holding the putter in my hands right now.  I just -- yeah, simply need a few birdie putts.  Hasn't been enough of them.  They've been quite a few par putts.  My putts, greens in regulation has got to be leading the field.  So as long as that greens in regulation stat goes up and that stays the same, seems to be a easy game from there, right?
