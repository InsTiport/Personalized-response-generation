Q. You came out first, obviously you wanted to get some momentum going, but just didn't turn out your way today.
JORDAN SPIETH: No, we both played very poor rounds of golf and we didn't have many chances, so it was Merry Christmas to the other guys.
Q. Any particular hole that is could have turned it around or shots that stuck out?
JORDAN SPIETH: We were 2-under as a team through eight, and that's average, and we were 1-up -- I mean through seven.  And then he made the 60-footer from off the green on the number.
