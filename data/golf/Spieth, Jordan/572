  JASON SPIETH:   Which I'd take through for times.   But the four bogeys mixed in, a couple were tough holes, but all in all, just not very smart shots from me.   
No.9, I had a 3 wood that I could reach the green on.   If I miss anywhere right, it's pretty much a birdie, and I went ahead and hit it left.   It's a struggle from there.   So that was kind of giving away two shots in my head.   
Overall, other than that hole, I like where I'm at.   I like the position I'm in.   Just kind of‑‑ I want to stay more patient this week than I did the last few weeks.   I think that I got a little antsy, a little ahead of myself, and on this golf course, you can't do that.   
The greens are receptive, and I love the way they putt.   So all in all, I'm in a good spot going into the next few rounds.   
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JASON SPIETH:   They were fine.   I actually didn't feel any nerves whatsoever.   I just kind of approach it like a normal tournament.   It's a PGA Tour event, and there happens to be a bigger bonus on the end of it.   
All in all, I was pretty calm to start out there.   Just missed‑‑ I didn't have great control of my long clubs.   Had a few hooks with my 3 woods and bogeyed the 1st, but it wasn't nerves.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JASON SPIETH:   Yeah.   I'd like to be a little smarter into the greens.   I don't think I hit as many greens as I really should have today.   
Part of it was a few tee balls that were not in the right position, but overall I had good looks into the greens, maybe didn't play the smartest shots on a couple of the par 3s.   I just need to get to the range and figure out a couple. Maybe didn't play the smartest shots on a couple of the par 3s.   I just need to get to the range and figure out a couple of things.   
I like the way I'm converting the midrange putts out here.   I'm seeing the lines.   I didn't really misread.   A couple of short ones just a little offline.   All in all, it was a positive day.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   You mean the tournament at Torrey?   Yeah, I think I do.   I mean, I've said it since I was 16 back in Dallas.   You're in a tournament, if you're not playing to win, what are you playing for?   
Yeah, I mean, at the time, I didn't know exactly what it would take if I was in contention as a professional on the weekend, but, yeah, I think, to answer your question, I still believe that I can do it.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, a 9 1/2.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   What that tournament did is I felt how much pressure there was when competing on Sunday, and I also saw that I was able to make birdies when I felt the pressure, and that's what was so positive to take out of that week was being able to absolutely make some birdies when I felt like I really needed to and really wanted them.  
It was the first step in the direction where maybe a shorter path to get on Tour than I had envisioned, maybe starting that tournament.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   You know, I don't think so, not really.   Not from an overall tournament perspective.   The U.S. Open was probably as much of a struggle as I've had, and that was close to being good.   Just a little thing here or there in my driver.   I could have been playing well there.   
So there's been‑‑ I've had just a few missteps throughout the whole year, and in that time, I was really close to making the cut.   Just didn't quite have one thing or another, but the next week was a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone,].   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Before I turned pro, I missed 2 out of 8.   One or two.   I missed one by a shot at the St. Jude when I was 16.   I think there was another one.   
I was at 18 and missed a putt.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   It's amazing what's happened with a lot of my peers too.   I mean, they started as junior amateurs, and pretty much everyone's made the cut, which is cool to see.   
I think that's something the tournament should look into is giving them more opportunities because that's, by far, the reason I felt comfortable with my decision to come out here, and I think played well early was having been in a position as an amateur to have success.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]   
JORDAN SPIETH:   For being ready to turn pro?   Yeah, probably, I would say, if you Combine the last two rounds at Olympic club at the U.S. Open, I made the cut on the number and then shot 70, 69 on the weekend, 1 under, which I think is second best to Webb, who won.   
So being able to play the weekend of a Major Championship under par, at a U.S. Open under par, I think is when I sat back and said, you know, maybe I'm ready to go.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I actually‑‑ I told‑‑ I'd announced pretty much to my family and coach that I was turning pro that summer.   Then I just turned after the fall season.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]  
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, that wouldn't have been good.
