JORDAN SPIETH: I hit two greens of the first 13 holes, two greens in 13 holes means you're probably not going to be under par no matter where you're playing, especially here.  Started hitting some greens and really got that putter hot.  I made a couple I maybe didn't expect to make, and I actually made a couple great par saves that kind of started getting my putter hot, and finally they were more birdie instead of par.   
 Q.  You're always grinding out there, always scoring.  It's hard when you see other guys playing well and maybe you're struggling; how important is it for you to be able to turn a round like today around?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Today was a big round for me.  I won the mental battle with myself.  I've been struggling a little bit tee to green as of late, not to the same strokes gained level that I normally play at.  Just searching for a couple different answers in my swing that weren't there, but to shoot 2-under around this place without having it bodes well for the rest of the week.  Hopefully we can try and improve each round just a little bit.   
You know, for me it's very difficult to hit greens in regulation out here.  This is one of the hardest weeks of the year for that, but that's a statistic I'm really trying to work on and one that we really grinded those last five holes to get five of them.   
 Q.  Looked like the golf course got a little tougher as it went through the day.  Pretty bouncy in the fairway at 18.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I told Michael I was shocked when we got up there.  I wanted him to do the math on how far I hit it, just because you don't hit it that far very often, at least I don't.  It was my longest of the year.  Bit of a tough break to end up in the first cut kind of blocked by the tree, but hit a good wedge in there and knocked in the putt.  As you said, it was bouncing a lot.  Hopefully the storm rolling in tomorrow doesn't bring a ton of rainfall because I like the course like this.  I think it plays better this way.
