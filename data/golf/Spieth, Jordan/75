Q. Any reason why it took a different turn than you thought at the start?
JORDAN SPIETH: I just had a couple of opportunities, I had some in-between numbers that I didn't really pick the right shot and I got in trouble, and really, chipping let me down.  I had a couple opportunities to save par and just stay at even, dropped to 2-, 3-down, and then he out-putted me.
