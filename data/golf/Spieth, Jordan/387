Q. You broke par.  That was a first, right?JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.Q. Kind of another little goal accomplished?JORDAN SPIETH: I guess so.  It goes with the bigger goal of trying to give myself a chance to win this championship.  It wasn't going to happen shooting even. Really happy with the finish.  I felt like, even though I only hit three greens on the front nine, which is my back nine, I hit a lot of really good shots. 4 through 7, I didn't feel like I missed a shot, and I was 2-over on those holes.  That was really frustrating. When I was on No. 8, after I caught a flier on that second, I was as frustrated as I've been in a while on the course just because I didn't know what I could be doing, what I could be doing any better.  I'm playing the wind.  The wind shoots it one way when it's supposed to go the other, or the ball is flying a little shorter or further than expected.  Just couldn't quite get it nailed in to the right number.  And then I was a little aggressive on a couple of putts. But very pleased with the way I can make six birdies hitting nine greens.  That's a nice percentage if we could up the greens in regulation.Q. Was the ball on 7 just -- not on 7.  On 5, just a little overaggressiveness on that putt?JORDAN SPIETH: I looked in my greens book, and it showed downhill overall.  When you're behind it, it looks like you're putting up a ridge.  I knew it was going to be a little quicker when I thought.  When I hit it, I thought it was three foot past pace.  I'd be surprised if you see some guys hit that the right pace this afternoon.  That's a wicked hard putt and one that you actually almost want to be left of the hole and long on that tee shot, and I felt like I hit it right where it needed to be. It was a little aggressive.  It was a little harder than I wanted to hit it, but as it was moving, I didn't think it would go that far by.Q. Why don't you play golf left-handed?JORDAN SPIETH: Give everybody else a chance.  Don't quote me on that.Q. When you first picked up a stick of some sort, was it always a right-handed swing?  Or was there ever --JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I'm pretty sure, from when I was really, really little, it was a baseball bat and a golf club right-handed.  My dad's left-handed.  So the opposite of Phil and his dad.  He's swinging one way, teaching me, whether it's hitting a baseball or it's swinging a club, and I'm facing him learning. But for whatever reason, I throw left-handed.  I'm all messed up.  Basketball lefty.  I'm left eye dominant.  I have more feel in my left hand.  That's why I putt left hand low.  That's why when my head tilts or whatever I can see my lines better.Q. Your first chip-in in a while.  How did that feel?JORDAN SPIETH: I think since the Deere, so a couple tournaments.  We had a couple that week.  That felt nice.  That ball was humming.  It was going to go seven or eight feet past the hole, but it wasn't that hard of a chip.  It just came out a little flyer-like.  But hit the pin dead center, and that was -- I didn't hit one good shot on that hole, and I made birdie.  And then I didn't miss a shot on 4, and I make a bogey.  Then miss a shot on 5 and -- it's just crazy. This game of golf can be a little odd in the slightest way sometimes.Q. How many is that for the year?JORDAN SPIETH: It's 13 now, which is right on the over/under between me and Mike, which means anything from now is a win.  I got it.
