Q. Disappointment of checking out not just the tournament but here where you had so much support?
JORDAN SPIETH: I knew after Round 1 I wasn't in control of my own destiny anymore, so that was the disappointing day.  I made some good progress the last couple of days.  After a two-week break, historically, I've been a little rough to start.  Then it gets better.
Today I was able to hit some shots under pressure.  I felt a significant amount of pressure on the back nine.  I was really proud of the way that I hit the ball, especially off the tee.  That's been my biggest struggle.  I think I hit every I think single fairway today.  That's massive going forward.  I felt like a lot of progress was made in today's match.  I shot 6-under in a tied match with Ryan, which is what on Tuesday night or Monday night's drawing figured would be the case.  It could be for winning the group.  All in all, I'm very, very happy right now going forward.  Going to try and build on this momentum in Houston.
Q. Are you more encouraged than disappointed?
JORDAN SPIETH: Absolutely, at this point.  I knew going in it was unlikely -- the guy that beat me on Wednesday is a really solid player who is on top of his game right now.  He's not missing many shots.  He only had one bad swing against me.  And the guy I played yesterday, Ikeda, who is a really good player as well, just isn't quite in the same form.  It looked like going into it it was going to be a pride match with Ryan, but throughout the match I didn't look at a scoreboard, pretended like winner was advancing.  And that's what brought those nerves and that adrenaline to me.  I was able to see some tendencies and I can adjust for them and that's what you are trying to do as far as building momentum towards next week and then the Masters.
Q. Do some work over the weekend or get some rest?
JORDAN SPIETH: Probably a little bit of both.  I won't put in really long days, but I plan on not completely taking them off either.  At the same time, we've got a plan in place to try and get the right amount of practice and rest, which is always important to peak at the Masters and then at all majors thereafter.
So I'm not exactly sure.  I'm probably going to have a beer tonight.  It's my little sister's 16th birthday.  So first things first, we're going to celebrate.  She's been looking forward to her 16th birthday for two years.  It's a special day in our family today and I'm excited to share it with her.
Q. Are you going to go to Augusta before Houston?
JORDAN SPIETH: Probably.
Q. One day?
JORDAN SPIETH: Not sure yet.  I was still going into today optimistic that I would be here Sunday late.  It's only 20 minutes after.  I'll figure it out -- I don't know if I will figure it out tonight.
Q. You are still doing Houston?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yes.
Q. Going to the Masters, 28 guys have shot 62, 63 in a major championship.  Never 62.  Why do you think no one has broken the 62 level in a major championship?
JORDAN SPIETH: Well, the only constant golf course each year is Augusta National, and it's a par 72.  So that makes it quite a bit harder.  Nowadays we're playing a lot of 71s and 70s where par-5s are turning into par-4s.  As far as a number, it's very difficult to get to 10 under in a round, let alone on a course that's as difficult as Augusta National.  Then after that, the other majors are designed -- the Masters and maybe the PGA and maybe The Open at St. Andrews are the only majors where that really could happen.  I don't expect to see it at a U.S. Open.  Unlikely at an Open Championship unless it's St. Andrews, which is also a 72.  I think just a combination of things.
Q. Doable, you think, for somebody?
JORDAN SPIETH: I think it will be done at some point.  That record will be broken at some point.
