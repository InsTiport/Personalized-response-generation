JORDAN SPIETH: It's been an off-putting week for me.  Searching for it, but just haven't quite finished out a major with the speed.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JORDAN SPIETH: I've been striking the ball well.  It's just been trying to figure it out on and around the greens.  And I feel like once the cannon gets open, I'll start pouring them in.  It's trying to get them open.  Trying to have a round right.  I started feeling a couple of rounds at Colonial like that, where I really felt like I was seeing the lines, I was confident going into it.  I knew going into it that it was either going to go in or be close to going in.
And out here I'm just thinking a lot about my stroke, stance, stuff you would rather not be thinking about, you'd rather think about line of pace.  But I can't do that yet because I haven't figured out the other part.
Frustrating in that regard, but today was an off day.  Pitchers have good days and bad days, and I took an L today and come back tomorrow and try to finish this round strong going into next week.
Q. Do you have a feel for how it will be condition-wise for the leaders this afternoon, will it be gettable?
JORDAN SPIETH: The conditions allow you to have plenty of opportunities, but the pin positions are the defense.  And they're very difficult.  It's actually really tough on half the holes today almost impossible to be below the hole.
So you're going to get some kind of odd putts where you've really got to watch the pace.  So there's quite a few holes today where that's putting.  But off the tee, the guys that are playing well, that are hitting fairways.  You can still put it on the safe sides of greens.  And I think you'll see the score move from 7-under, I think you'll move it closer to 10 after today, just given the conditions.
Q. Is today what you thought it was going to be?
JORDAN SPIETH: It is what we felt like it was going to be.  Kind of figured, going into the week, I think I mentioned it out loud, if not to you guys, I mentioned it to our team.  But I thought it was going to be somewhere around 10-under for the winning score.  With that being said, that's pretty much what's happening.  So I would say that was about what we thought we needed to do.
Shots into the greens, you've got to be careful with on shots into the green, and pick your spots to take advantage.  When you get behind, you have to try to force some, and sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't and it didn't work out for me today.
Q. Can you talk about what you're struggling with?
JORDAN SPIETH: I think that's random.  I think it's just happened to be the case.  There's a lot of fantastic players who have been playing well this entire year, that are up on the first page of the leaderboard and guys that have been playing well recently.  If you're in good form that's going to stay here.  It's pretty -- hit the fairway and then from there you can feed it to some of the pins and other holes you have to be careful on.
If you have good control of the golf ball, and if you're rolling the ball on the greens you're going to play well here.  It's not like it's -- I don't think it's anything with the course setup that has anything to do with World Rankings, because it's really just who has been playing well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it's the stage more than anything, which Scottie last year was in the top-10 for a lot of the tournament at a much more difficult venue.  And I've grown up knowing and playing with Scottie and to me it doesn't surprise me, necessarily.  It might surprise others, when they see an A on the leaderboard.  But he's certainly capable of doing that.  And I'm not trying to take anything away from what he's doing by saying so, I'm actually trying to compliment him, in that he's always been capable of doing that.
I think it's great.  I think it's awesome.  I certainly wish him the best.  I think he's 4-under for the day.
And you can push it.  The last five holes here today, you've got the pins on 14 and 15 are certainly birdie holes.  And then 16, if you can carve one in there on the back shelf, you can get a very makeable putt.
17 and 18 are playing tough.  The course was longer today, the longest that it's been.  But Scottie, he is the length, and certainly the confidence to continue this.
