Q.   Jordan, tell me about the day.   So tough with the conditions.   You fought all the way, even par, 9-under.   Look at you, you're right in contention as we head to Sunday.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Overall being one back, you know, in a great position for Sunday.   Saturdays have kind of been tough days this year for me as far as being a moving day.   You know, just can't make that many bogies.   Didn't feel really confident with the putter but I'm going to regroup and start being aggressive tomorrow and should be in good shape to make a run at it.

Q.   Taking into account all of the play in the first three rounds, how do you feel about tomorrow as far as where your game is as you head into the final round of the Wyndham Championship?
JORDAN SPIETH:   I feel good.   I got a little off in the rain, off the tee had a couple balls kind of squirt right on me so I'm sure tomorrow hopefully it will be better but the course is going to be wet.   Now we know how it's playing after playing a full round on the moist conditions.   So, I feel great.   I really do.   I feel like today I was really far off and only shot even.   So that's good news for tomorrow.

Q.   Especially being in contention, you've been there before just a few weeks ago and you pulled it off.   Here we go with another Sunday and you're right there.
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah.   It's great.   I didn't feel any nerves out there, which is rare.   I was leading the golf tournament on my own at a couple points in the round.   So, that was reassuring to feel really comfortable and calm while in the lead.   I'll try and get there tomorrow.
