Q. Hopefully forget the last five?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball great.  I have been hitting the ball great this whole year and going back into late last year.  I have just been kind of looking for that groove putting, and it's almost there.  Feels like it's close.
And then, you know, I hit some good putts at the end that just missed.  Kinda second-guessed a couple of reads.  But, yeah, I played really well today.  I love the way I'm striking the golf.
The decision on 18 was rough, because, you know -- I mean, we discussed and, you know, I had Michael's confidence that, hey, if you hit it solid, it's for sure going to carry that water.  Driver becomes a wider landing zone.  And I smashed it and it still didn't carry.  That was kind of a bugaboo on our part.
Overall, I'm hitting the ball great.  It's close to a low round.  It had a chance today.  Even when I was 5-, 6-under on the round, I still missed quite a few putts and made a couple of mid-rangers.  So it feels good.
Q. Are you still in it?
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, maybe.  I mean, on this course, 6-under makes up a lot of ground in a round, so I'm going to have to shoot something like that I think tomorrow to have a chance on Sunday.
But, yeah, 6 back, I think 5 or 6 back before Sunday of the John Deere the first time we won.  Certainly capable of it.  The way I feel over the ball, I'm very confident.  I know as well as anybody that once a couple start going in they start pouring in.
Just gotta get out and keep staying in the same rhythm.
Q. Did you think the tee shot on 18 hadn't crossed the line?  Is that...
JORDAN SPIETH: It was close.  It was a dead straight ball right on that corner.  I was obviously trying to fade it a little bit, knowing that if I hit it straight, it should have enough to carry.
It was really, really close, and I thought it was too close to call.  So rather be safe than sorry.
