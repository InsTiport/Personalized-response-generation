JORDAN SPIETH: And then 8 through 11, then I started to get it back.
Q. I thought your short game really spectacular out there today.  Of course at 18, almost holed that second shot.
JORDAN SPIETH: That's right.  I had -- somehow that drive got all the way down there.  I haven't hit a long one on 18 yet until there.  Then had a perfect number with a 3-iron.  A very similar number that I had on 17.  So I just tried to play the exact same shot and they both came off the club face very similar.
So I knew when it was in mid air I knew it was going to be the right distance.  It was a matter of kind of the bounces it was going to get.  And fortunately it went right below the hole.
Q. Strong finish.  You have guys shooting 9-under par, 10-under par.  But yet you still extend the lead to get a 5-shot lead heading into Sunday.  Got to feel good.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, it does.  It's amazing, I thought that 4-under, 5-under was a great score today.  That was what I wanted to do.
Then all of a sudden Brooks is shooting 10.  And so obviously they're going to be bringing it tomorrow.  So it's not over, I certainly have to put something in the 60s I think tomorrow in order to win.
