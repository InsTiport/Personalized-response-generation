 Q.  What's going through your mind and body standing over a putt like that?  
PATRICK REED: I knew I had it.  Just kind of one of those things that every time I have a pressure putt in that kind of situation, I think of all the times practicing those on the putting green.  Just try to get as much positive thoughts I can possibly in my mind on putts like that, because really without having that on the line, it's just a normal putt.  They are never the easiest, so you have to figure out some way to make them easy.   
 Q.  For those of who will never understand what it's like to be inside the ropes, how difficult is it to close out a match in the Ryder Cup?  
JORDAN SPIETH: You know, we haven't had a problem before, we just hit a few sloppy shots.  I made a bad decision there on 15 trying to hit the hero shot instead of laying back and very well could have made par and won the match.   
So we played a fantastic round.  We were something like 6-under through 12 holes in alternate shot in this course which is a ridiculous number.   
And they played great.  The way we played wins most matches and they stayed steady with it and hit the shots they needed to coming down the stretch.  Big putt by Patrick to salvage half a point, although still disappointing for us.
