Q. Always nice to have a clean card.  Four birdies, no bogeys for you.
JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, really nice.  Chipping, putting are really solid.  Putting inside 10 feet.  Chipped the ball really nicely.  Didn't have too many stressful par chances through the out the day.  But I only hit 12 greens.  So on a course that's pretty gettable without much wind, you need to make more birdies to make up for any mistakes going forward.  So I'm just looking at greens in regulation going forward.
Q. The greens look like they're really receptive where you can take aim at the hole locations.
JORDAN SPIETH: Same with the fairway, they're not running through.  Still soft.  Ball in hand, you're hitting off a good lie each time.  So, yeah, it's kind of target practice right now.  The greens are rolling beautifully and I hit a lot of, quite a few really good putts that just didn't quite go in.  It would have made it a pretty special round, given only hitting 12 greens.  So, all in all, I'm excited about the ball striking as this week goes on and seeing those putts drop.
