JORDAN SPIETH: I had great ball control the last three days.  Played very, very solid rounds.   
I got to the range this morning and I was hitting slices with my irons, which is bizarre.  I never really get that.  I tried to fix it on the range, didn't know what was up.  I'd swing what felt like normal and I'd look up and the ball was going -- I just tried to compensate some on the golf course got away with it the first couple of holes and then it got the best of me.   
I'm not really sure what happened.  Just really an off day.  I like my off days to be a little more consistent.   
 Q.  What is it like when you are such a creature of habit and are used to such excellence, and you go out there and you don't have your A game.  From the shoulders up, how do you compensate for that?  
JORDAN SPIETH: I think we did a decent job.  It's frustrating when you are so uncomfortable over the ball.  You are trying to commit to these targets, but you are also trying to make the same swings that you made and just assume that the range was something separate.  It's trying to find the balance.  Mentally I still felt like we were okay.  Just very, very uncomfortable over the golf ball today.   
To be honest, for the week, I was still maybe 10-under in these four rounds even with a very poor day today.  So if I look at it that way, we got some momentum this week that we didn't have before that we can carry through Houston and into the Masters.
