Q. Big difference from yesterday.  What happened out there?
JORDAN SPIETH: Just an off day.  You know, I just ball-striking wise made -- made strides in my putting this week, which is something I can take a lot of confidence into next week.  I was a bit rough around the edges in my putting last week in Austin and really felt like I put better strokes on it here, and putting well next week obviously, as we know, is important considering I didn't strike it very well last year and certainly was in position to win.
So, just fine-tune things a little bit and continue work on the short game, and this extra time off could be good for us.
Q. Given the weekend weather forecast here, is this missed cut a little easier to stomach than others?
JORDAN SPIETH: No, because I was not playing this tournament just as a leeway into the Masters.  I was playing this tournament because I love this tournament and we lost in a playoff here before.  I know we can have success.  Certainly tough go around the course today, and you know the weather in Augusta is not good on Monday, either.
I'm not sure what's going to happen with the end of this week into next week.  Our plan is probably to get there by Saturday night or Sunday morning at this point and get to work.
So, to answer your question, there's no easy missed cut in my mind.  We come into every tournament with the idea that we want to win that week and our focus is on that week.  Yeah, a bit disappointing in that sense.
Q. Following up on that, how frustrating is it not to have two more rounds here to continue playing well?
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't have two weekends in a row off very often.  So, few years ago we missed the cut here and we had a chance to win on Sunday, so I'm not considering myself out of next week.  I think we know and the other players that are playing next week know that we strike fear in others next week.
So, that's our idea, that's going to be my confidence level going in, and we'll step on the first tee ready to play.
Q. Your plan is to get there tomorrow and hit the course Sunday?
JORDAN SPIETH: I'm not sure exactly, but I'd like to be out there for drive, chip and putt.  I thought it was a really neat experience a couple years ago.  I'll be happy to support my jacket out there with the kids and get some work in that day.  Kind of yet to be determined.  Obviously I need to get in there by Sunday with the weather that's going to be hitting this area and Dallas on Sunday and over there Monday.  So, I'll get that extra day that some guys might not have.
