 Q.  Congratulations, Jordan and Patrick, on your 3 & 2 win.  Captain Love sent you out with a big job to do.  Out in the first match.  Got up early and just kind of cruised from there.  Was it as simple really as it looked?  
PATRICK REED: I wouldn't say simple.  Any time you are take on Rose and Stenson, it's never simple.  We had a great game plan coming in, we stuck with it.  Just hit a lot of greens.  In alternate shot you have to do that, give yourself opportunities.  And we were lucky enough to be able to hit a lot of greens and have good looks.   
 Q.  Total control on that front side, and then the putt on 9 that wasn't conceded.  I saw a lot of eyebrows and that green go why not?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Honestly, looking back, we probably should have given --   
Where the pin was was up higher and it's actually really, really tricky around that hole.  The cup sits one way where the slope is the other.  Honestly we should have given it to them.  At the same time, we didn't want to run in.  We make mistakes sometimes and he's never going to miss it.  What are you going to do.
