 Q.  I know it's not what you wanted to do today.  Tell us about the conditions out there.  
JORDAN SPIETH: Very difficult.  Got it off to a good start.  It was hard after that.  You just have to stay patient and understand that you are going to shoot 4-over plus once you are 4-over through two holes.   
Just tried to do a little too much on the second hole and it kind of bit me.  From there it was just kind of a grind.  Played pretty well to be even through the rest of the nine and then just didn't make very good swings.  There were certainly some dicey pins but at the same time there was guys that shot under par.  So I could have played better.
