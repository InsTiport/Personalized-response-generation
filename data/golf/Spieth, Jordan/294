 Q.  The obvious, how hard was it to stop and start, stop and start?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Very hard with the wind being into us on a lot of the holes as well.  We made that turn, 17 through No. 3, the end of our round there, that's definitely a challenge.  It's a challenge not being able to warm up too, going out there and trying to hit tee shots at the U.S. Open, but it is what it is.   
Hopefully, we'll get some good conditions in the morning, and those other guys have to play 36 holes in a row at a U.S. Open, which isn't easy.   
 Q.  The course, how much did it change each time you came out?  
JORDAN SPIETH: Completely different golf course than we played in the practice round.  I mean, night and day.
