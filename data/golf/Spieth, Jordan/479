 Q.  Having to do with the grouping?  JORDAN SPIETH: Well, it was more just, you know, just getting back into it.  It was the longest break I have ever been away from the tournament, so I have just been so anxious for so long that once it was there, I guess the first few holes I just wanted to get started, off to a good start. I just pumped one off my own room on 5.  But for real, though, I actually did pump it off my own room on 5.   Q.  It was your house?  JORDAN SPIETH: Well, when I saw the ball, I heard it like hit the cart path or something.  It went up, and that's my room right there.   Q.  Nice going, Ace.  JORDAN SPIETH: I have never done that before.   Q.  You played nice today, though.  JORDAN SPIETH: I didn't score well for how I was playing.  My putting was just a little rusty.  Overall ball striking is almost there.  My driver and my putter just weren't quite there to shoot a low score.  But they're close.   Q.  Energy-wise the whole day?  JORDAN SPIETH: It was cool.  16's fun.  It was nice to get a putter raise out there.  That was cool.   Q.  Did you guys have a bet on that one?  JORDAN SPIETH: No, no.  We may have one with Snedeker.  We may not.  I'm not sure. No, we don't.  But, yeah, it was a lot of fun, and this tournament's quite a bit different than any other in just the noise aspect.  And, you know, playing with Tiger, walk down the fairways, everyone is yelling, anyways.  Doesn't matter where you are.  Here you get a little extra juice, little extra fire because they have all had a little bit to drink.   Q.  (Question about being up 23 strokes.)  JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.  I haven't caught his best day, but it looks like he turned it around there and look for tomorrow to be a little better.  It's just a little shallower, so he said.  So he's just adjusting to the chipping. But other than that, other than that, he started to really turn that around on the back 9.   Q.  For a guy who is always bad-mouthing himself about his lack of length, and you both popped one good on 17, and...  JORDAN SPIETH: I didn't think that was going to reach.  That was just an average drive for me.   Q.  (Indiscernible.)  JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah.  That one got out there.  That was pretty good for me.  Little pumped up there, which helped. But, yeah, I mean, right now I'm a little in between floating it a little bit and really compressing it and getting it out there, and throughout the week I have had a little bit of both.  When I get more than half of them compressed --   Q.  Why are you between?  Just reps?  JORDAN SPIETH: No, it's just -- yeah, I think it's just reps.  Even the ones that are floating, for the most part, are finding the right side of the fairway.  Floating in the right direction. But they're not -- just the one on 5 really was a 3-wood hole today for me today.  I had some mental rust to get off.  That's about it.
