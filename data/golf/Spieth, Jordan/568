  JORDAN SPIETH:   Hit a great wedge there.   Two good shots and a birdie on the par 5.   16 wasn't expected.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit into 16?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I hit an 8 iron at about 176 and I adjusted, so about 180.   Really amped up to that pin on the ledge.   
I actually hit it on the ledge the last two days.   So I was like, you know what, might as aim for the middle of green with a little fade, and it will go where it's been going.   Luckily the pin was up there this time and rolled the putt in.  
   
 Q.   [No microphone.]   
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, I just hit it fat.   I was in between clubs.   I'll be honest with you, I was right in between clubs.   If I hit an 8 iron to a left pin it was going to be hard to control from the back of the green side, so I tried to just kill a 9.   It was just tough that I had that yardage.   
If I did kill the 9, it would have been perfect.   But just a touch fat and hit it in the bunker.  
   
 Q.   What a way to end the season.   Boy, what a season.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Thank you.   It's been a dream come true.  
   
 Q.   Jordan, you have breaking new ground all season.   What did you learn about yourself today?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was another round where I felt the same pressure I felt at the John Deere, at the Windham.   Right when I was up there on Sunday.   It's only happened a few times this year really.   
Felt it kind of the last five, six holes there, and it was just really, really cool to have my putting stroke hold up.   
And I judged my distances into the greens a lot better than I have in the past.   So taking a lot of confidence out of that finish.  
   
 Q.   Just for a moment, it went to 1, and then 17 happened to you.   It must have been the end of a bit of momentum for you?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   I had it in between yardage, and I hit it a little fat.   I was in between 9 and 8, and if the pin's on the right side, then I hit the same shot that I hit on 16.   
With it being on the left, if I try and draw the 8, it's just going to go too far.   So I tried to smoke a 9 iron like 160 into the breeze.   Obviously, I'm pumped up.   So it had to play that.   Just caught it just a touch fat with the ball by my feet and unfortunately plugged in the sand.  
   
 Q.   You have a lot of media stuff to do.   That will keep you hanging around.   You never know what might happen.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   He was hitting 5 irons off the tee, so maybe he's playing for the FedExCup.   You never know what might happen, but I'm pleased with the day.
