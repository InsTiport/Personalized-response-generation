 Q.   A little bit easier of a victory for Jordan here on Thursday.   During the point of a match, there's usually a critical moment.   How important was that hole‑out on 3 to save par?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, it was huge.   I mean, early in the match, I won 2.   He hit not a great wedge shot in there.   I just hit it in the worst place I could on 3.   
Holing that bunker shot just kind of killed any little momentum going back.   He would have had the tee on 4 and being all square versus being one down and I get to play safe and give myself some 15‑footers for birdie and some will go in.   It was huge.   
I mean, really that early in the match, if I would have lost it, I don't think it would have made much of a difference if it didn't go in, but it kept the momentum going my way.  
   
 Q.   You put the foot on the gas, next thing you know you are 4‑up.   How does that happen so quickly?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   You know, I played the tough holes well.   I hit the fairway on the tough holes.   I birdied 5, which is a rare birdie, I think, today.   Just kept on hitting the green.   That's the way to put the pedal down, if you can put the ball on the green first on those par‑3s and make your opponent hit it close to the hole, it's very difficult to do with how firm the greens are and the wind picking up.   Pars become really good scores.   If they make a birdie then they deserved it.   Then you try and play the easier holes well and get some looks myself.  
   
 Q.   Young guns playing well here this week.   Why do you think they are having so much success?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I don't know.   I don't know if there's anything to it.   There's just so many great players here that ‑‑ you know, it depends on the draw.   I mean, Thomas didn't have his best stuff today.   I wasn't playing well at all, it would have been a close match coming to the end.   I think age doesn't make a whole lot of a difference in match play.   It's one on one.   If anybody has any experience going back to junior golf, it's good experience.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it's NCAA, junior golf, amateur golf and Walker Cup that helps you and others out here?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I think so, definitely.   I wish we played more match play on the pro level.   It's fun.   I mean, you can be a little more aggressive in nature, which is hard for me because I'm already too aggressive.   I actually need to calm down a little.   
You just see some guys play some shots that maybe you wouldn't see if they are trying Thursday and Friday to play safe and avoid making a bogey or double versus trying a certain flop shot or different types of shots.
