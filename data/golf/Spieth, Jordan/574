 Q.   6‑under par 65 in round 2, even par in round 1 in perfect conditions.   How do you explain the turnaround?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yesterday was a lot windier than today.   You know, the wind is up today, but it's consistently‑‑ it was probably 10 miles an hour more yesterday it felt like.   Maybe that was just teeing off an hour later.   But honestly, just I controlled‑‑ when I hit a bad shot, the ball was still on the green today and I was able to two‑putt.   But for the most part I was on the correct tier all day.   I didn't have to stress too much.   The couple bogeys I had weren't normal mistakes.   One the wind ball stick (phonetic) and the other was a really tough pin placement.   All in all, really happy with being able to make eight birdies on the day and still not birdieing any of the par‑5s.  
   
 Q.   You must be a pretty good wind player coming from Texas.   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I think when it's windy, I feel like I may have an advantage just growing up in it.   But these guys have played in wind for years and years on the PGA TOUR, of course, so still, it's different, because the ball‑‑ it affects the ball on the greens more.   The greens are more closely mowed, and it kind of has more of an effect around the greens than it did growing up.   
   
 Q.   I saw Jason on the last two holes obliterating the ball.   When you see that, do you say, wow, there's still more I can do?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, I'm definitely not the longest hitter, and when Jason connects with it, there's not many that are longer.   He busted that one on No.8 almost 400 yards.   It's pretty far out there because I was back at 335, and I hit it good.   
Yeah, he can smoke it.   There's definitely ways to improve, but we'll wait until the off‑season to try and improve.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to do this off‑season?  
JORDAN SPIETH:   I'm going to take a lot of time.   I'm going to definitely have an off‑season.   I'm going to take some time hanging out for weeks at a time and mix in a couple events.   I'm not sure where yet, but there's a lot of great opportunities.   
   
 Q.   Keegan Bradley yesterday said you're not playing like it, but you must be tired.   It's been such a taxing year.   Are you?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   No, I don't think so.   I think each week there's been a little more adrenaline that comes up from different scenarios.   I mean, obviously last week waiting on the Presidents Cup, getting announced to join that team, kind of gives me a new push, I guess, to play my best golf the next four weeks, and after that I can rest.   Yeah, it has been a lot of golf.   It's been more than twice as much as I've ever played.   In that sense I am mentally a little drained, but when I step on the first tee, that's not the case.  
   
 Q.   What was your highlight today if you had one?   
JORDAN SPIETH:   Probably No.4.   No.4 is one of the hardest holes out there, and I ripped driver and then hit probably the best 4‑iron of my life up there to about six feet and made it.   I don't think there was going to be many birdies there today.
