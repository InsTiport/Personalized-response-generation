Q.   Played the par‑5s well today, right?   Was that a conscious effort?
JORDAN SPIETH:   It was more of an effort just to really play safe on the harder holes.   The par‑5s you can take advantage of out here, I 3‑putted the first par‑5 for par, kind of a bummer to start out, but bounced back and on the other par‑5s, I had a 2‑putt and then No. 2 I had a three, 4‑footer and then I finally made some putts on the back nine. 
Yeah, I was just really patient.   We picked a great day to have Spyglass.   With no wind, right after the rain, so it was soft.   Hardest part was controlling your spin they were so soft. 
But, greens putted well and towards the end of the round I was able to drop some par saves and then eventually birdie the last.

Q.   One of the toughest courses on the rotation.   You got to be happy?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Yeah, very, very happy.   When we were warming up on the range today and it was pouring rain, I was saying even par is a heck of a score, so, yeah, to end up coming back out and having great conditions, we really got fortunate and took advantage of it out here.   Very happy to go to Monterey tomorrow, as one of the first times, get some good greens out there and get off to a good start. 

Q.   Happy to get playing after the horn blew, right?
JORDAN SPIETH:   Oh, yeah, yeah I thought it was going to blow on 17 there and it just didn't.   And they waited until it was pretty dark to blow it and we were already on the green, so that was a no‑brainer, we were going to finish or else Jake was going to kill me, so that's good.
