Q. You guys had a little fun last night on Twitter, how fun is it, paired up, good friends, pulling each other the wrong way?
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't know if we pulled each other the wrong way.  To be honest, that was pretty strong for me, to shoot 1-over, that's a pretty good round.  I'm going to take my positives out of there.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a rough day for us both.  We just got a lot of kind of bad Mo to start the day but yeah, it's over with.  I'm happy to say that.
Q. You guys were on 18 laughing with each other, what was the joke?
JUSTIN THOMAS: We just went around in general, was the joke.
JORDAN SPIETH: We were talking about why they wouldn't move the tee up.  I was like, I had the right miss and hit the green -- he's like, I'm aware that you had the right miss, because he had taken the other side.  That's about it.
Q. Got to pay up, though -- the bet.
JUSTIN THOMAS: That wasn't real.
JORDAN SPIETH: It was just fun.
