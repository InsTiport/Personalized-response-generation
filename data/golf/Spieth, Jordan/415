 Q.  Today all that matters is you are tied for the lead heading into the Major Championship?  JORDAN SPIETH: Four three-putts today, two of them I could not do much about them.  The other two were unforced. All in all it was just a little bit off.  But plenty of birdies.  Just need to limit the mistakes tomorrow.   Q.  Tomorrow the world will be focused on you, completing the second leg of your career Grand Slam.  Do you think about that at all?  JORDAN SPIETH: No, not really.  A little bit here and there, because I'd like to win two in a row.  But tomorrow, once I get out on the golf course I'll just be focused on the round and how to separate myself from the pack.   Q.  Given how difficult Chambers Bay has been playing during these afternoon rounds, do you think it will be as much a mental test as a golfing test tomorrow?  JORDAN SPIETH: Yeah, I think so.  You're just going to have to take your medicine.  I tried to force it a couple of times, that's just what this course does.  If you don't position it well off the tee, you've really got to work hard for a par.  I'm going to need to drive the ball a little better to win.   Q.  A little more serious Jordan Spieth?  JORDAN SPIETH: Sorry, I'm fresh off the green, and that was a grind on the back nine.
