  Q. You started off today, you birdied on the first hole. How did you feel out of those?   
 BRENT MURRAY: Well, I had one good thing happen, that was it.   
  
  Q. Did the course play the way you expected?  
 BRENT MURRAY: I think the course was very good. The greens are fast and tricky and it's important to hit the ball in the fairway.   
  
  Q. What did you think of the back to back par-5s? That's pretty unusual.   
 BRENT MURRAY: That is kind of unusual, but, yeah, it's kind of odd, you don't play any of them until you get to 15 and then you get them both. But it's a great golf course. It was fun to be on it.   
  
  Q. Did today's play change some plans for you tomorrow?  
 BRENT MURRAY: Yeah, I might go and have a few drinks tonight, I don't know. I didn't do very well. Hopefully I can do better.
