Q. Today's round was really good.  What was the difference for you today.
RUIXIN LIU: I just feel the putting has been much better, and then also like last few days, because the green has so many layers, I just didn't end up in the right layer the last two days.
Today I was 80% on the right track, so I think that's what make the big difference.
Q. What's it been like for you playing an LPGA event in China this week?
RUIXIN LIU: Well, you know, because I will be on the LPGA next year, this feel like a warmup and let me get used to the situation, so it's really helpful for me next year.
Q. How confident are you feeling after ending the Symetra season the way you?
RUIXIN LIU: Well, it gives me a lot confidence like than before, but still I have a lot learn.  So keep calm and play my game and not think about too much.
Q. Do you have plans for the off-season in between?
RUIXIN LIU: Well, my plan is to do Lasik surgery on my eye because I have contact lenses plus dry eye.  Sometimes it's horrible on the courses.
So I still have to do a checkup after this and we will see how it goes.
Q. How are you feeling about that?  Excited?  Nervous?
RUIXIN LIU: I mean, definitely excited, but I don't know if I'm eligible to do it or not.  So still like a little nervous.  It's a surgery, so, yeah.
Q. Do you normally wear glasses?
RUIXIN LIU: When I'm not at golf courses, yeah, yeah.
Q. But on the golf course...
RUIXIN LIU: Only contacts, yeah.
Q. Okay.  Cool.  Looking forward to tomorrow's final /AE round?
RUIXIN LIU: Yeah.  Really excited, yeah.
Q. Your dad caddies for you?
RUIXIN LIU: Yeah.
Q. Do you have other people, family or friends, watching this week here?
RUIXIN LIU: No, just me and my dad.  Mom stayed at home this week.  Pretty sure my friend is watching like online scoring or maybe TV.
