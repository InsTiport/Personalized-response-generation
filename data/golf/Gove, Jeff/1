 Q. Jeff, a solid three under par at the opening round at the AT&T Classic, not a bad start. 
 JEFF GOVE: No, it's very good. The greens are unbelievable. They're the best we've played in awhile. And you got to be in the right spot or you are going to have tough putts. It's playing longer because we got the Bermuda out there. 
 A tough start. Could have been a few better. I'm happy. 

 Q. With the impending weather and the rest of the players on the course you got to feel great right now?
 JEFF GOVE: I do. I didn't think we'd get this much in. I thought we'd be here all day. So I'm looking forward to resting up for tomorrow or Saturday whenever.

 Q. What's the best part your game right now?
 JEFF GOVE: Surprisingly, probably my putting, putting and chipping. I'm not hitting the ball like I usually do so I got a little range work. Hopefully it doesn't rain too much. It's nice to be holing the par putts and a few birdie putts, getting my ball up and down.

 Q. Jeff, thanks for taking time. Good round. Go have some lunch. 
 JEFF GOVE: Thanks appreciate it. Talk to you later.
