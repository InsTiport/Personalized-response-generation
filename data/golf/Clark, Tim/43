  Q. One bogey out there today, a solid 66. I understand it could even have been better.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, I mean, I just left putted for three days really. Four tee putts, two of them today. Just kind of find I'm hitting the ball as good as I felt it all year. If I can get a spark in tomorrow, a lot of birdies.  
  
  Q. Is it just figuring out these new greens that no one has ever seen?  
 TIM CLARK: No, I don't think so. Just off with my speed, and that is coming. But I had a few better putts today, so we'll see tomorrow.  
  
  Q. When you are not rolling the flat board good, you hit it closer. I understand at 11 you almost took the putter out of the equation.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, hit to about a foot there. Had a couple like that and even missed a few like that.   
 It's just -- I guess, I'm extremely comfortable driving the ball in the enclave. I just need that to carry over.  
  
  Q. You are 10 under par, one round to play. Rocco and those guys, 14 and 15 right now as you finish. What do you think it's going to take at the end of Sunday?   
 TIM CLARK: You know, depends with those guys, too. But I feel like I have got another 6, 7 under par round in me. So, you know, I would expect 16, 17 to be a good number.
