  Q. Tough day but great finish there on those last two holes to sort of help things out a little bit.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, well, just it was tough scoring for me. I felt like I still hit the ball good, hit a lot of fairways. Front nine played really good, missed a few putts, and somehow wound up shooting over par. I mean, really, I felt like tee to green I still played good. Obviously Mike played a good round and it was tough for me to be out there seeing quite a few holes I was in the fairway, Mike would be in the rough, and I just kept walking away with bogeys, made bogey after bogey. Tough finish.   
 With a couple holes to go, I think I was seven back, now I'm going to be probably still five back. At least it keeps me in the tournament. Seven back would have been too much. At least I finished good. You know, I'd really be disappointed if I didn't make a couple birdies coming in.
