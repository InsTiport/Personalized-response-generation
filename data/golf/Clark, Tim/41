  Q. Tim, well played the final 36. I know those last two putts had to burn a little bit, but you played awfully well out there.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, you know, going into today I was quite well back, but I kind of figured if you could get it going around here, I might still have a chance even though we're on different nines and whatnot. This back nine I kind of got it going there with some iron shots. And like you said, unfortunate; a few putts would have helped. But very pleased.  
  
  Q. Was there some point during the day that you had something special going?  
 TIM CLARK: No, because it wasn't like I was going crazy low or anything. I think I shot -- well, the 6-under this afternoon was good, but this morning I only shot 4-under. It just felt steady. It never felt like I was going super low, so it never really crossed my mind.  
  
  Q. The front nine was playing pretty difficult. You were able to birdie 6 and just maintain momentum.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, I figured the front would be tougher. It's been tougher for me all week, so I didn't expect to shoot sort of 4-under on the back nine or whatever I did shoot. But again, some good iron shots put me in positions so I could make birdies.
