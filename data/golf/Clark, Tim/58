  Q. Pretty good position for you going into the weekend, you think?  
 TIM CLARK: Absolutely. Perfect. You know, there's some low scores if you play good, so I'm quite happy.   
  
  Q. Could you have been better today?   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, a little bit. I mean, I bogeyed the first hole and then I missed a few on the back nine. I missed a couple opportunities.  
 But, you know, you're looking at maybe two shots, which pretty much every round you can expect. I'm happy with the 6-under.   
  
  Q. Ended with five or six pars, I guess.   
 TIM CLARK: Yes.  
  
  Q. Did you leave any out there?  
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, like I said, I think if I look at 15 and 14, you should birdie 14, so that's an indication. I missed about ten feet there, and then didn't get close enough on 15.  
 I'm always happy to finish 16, 17, 18 with par. So I feel like what I missed out there I probably saved by parring coming in.  
  
  Q. Still right there heading into the weekend. Just your thoughts.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball good again and I'm starting to make putts. The short game is probably not too great, but if I continue to hit the ball like this, I think I'll be there.
