Q.   Another really solid round of golf.   Birdie on the last hole gets you into the final group on Sunday. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, I was quite happy with that.   Obviously these calmer conditions you'd hope to score a lot better, but it just seems like the course still showed some teeth, and really happy with that now.

Q.   How much patience did it take to rip off those eight straight pars on the back nine and finally finish with a birdie?
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, I mean, it was a little frustrating.   I had quite a few chances and a couple putts scraped the hole, but at the end of the day 4‑under is okay.

Q.   You have missed 14 greens over the course of this tournament, you have gotten up‑and‑down on 13 of those 14 occasions.   You have one single bogey this week. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, it's nice to get through three rounds of a tournament with one bogey, and obviously this is a tough course to do that.   This place just seems to bring out my best golf.

Q.   You're playing with a pair of rookies tomorrow. 
TIM CLARK:   Well, I'm sure they won't be too intimidated.   That's going to be fun to see them play.   There's all these young guys coming out these days, and they're ready to go right from the start, so it's going to be a fun battle.
