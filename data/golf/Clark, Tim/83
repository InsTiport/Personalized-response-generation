  Q.  Great comeback today, and you ended with an exclamation point.   
 TIM CLARK:  Yeah, certainly the best finish I've ever had to a round of golf with a 1, but a good round.  I don't see myself shooting too many 6-unders on this golf course being as long as it is, but I played solid today, and in my last 27 holes now, I'm 9-under.   
  
  Q.  That's what I mean, the comeback in the front nine in the first round, you've got it going now.  Does the confidence go way up when you make a birdie-birdie-eagle finish like that with a hole-in-one on the end?   
 TIM CLARK:  Not really, not really, but obviously I've played solid the last 27 holes, and that's really what I'm going to have to keep doing.  I see the leaders are now at 10, so I'm still a little bit back of that.  But nice to have a round like that and get me back in the tournament.   
  
  Q.  Tell us about the hole-in-one at 9.   
 TIM CLARK:  Yeah, they've shortened the hole a little bit for us, makes it a bit easier.  Hit a 6-iron in there.  I was obviously aiming a little right of the flag, but hit a really good shot and it hit soft and disappeared.
