Q.   What are your thoughts on that start? 
TIM CLARK:   It's a rather long course for me, so pretty happy with what I was able to do today, especially in the cold and wind which we had not expected so I'm very pleased.

Q.   Got it going from early on? 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, like I said, there's some long holes out there.   I hit a lot of woods and hybrids and just really tried to make sure I hit the fairway because obviously once you start missing the fairway, it's going to be a tough course.

Q.   We've noticed that with the weight of the scoring, nothing as prolific as previous years?
TIM CLARK:   Today was tough.   When it's a little bit cold and windy like it was, the course played extremely long.

Q.   How have you been playing?
TIM CLARK:   Not particularly well.   It's just kind of the season is winding down and everyone's body is a little bit tired.   I played last week, and I was excited about the prospect of playing this week and when you're here, you may as well give it your all.   I was looking forward to the round today. 

Q.   There's still plenty of golf to play, not only this week but as the season draws to its close?
TIM CLARK:   This will be it for me, which is nice.   But yeah, you want to end the season well.   This all counts for us for next year so there's a lot of incentive for the U.S.â€‘based guys, and like I said, this is a really big tournament.   It's nice to be in the mix right now.

Q.   Sounds like a little sniffle going on.   You okay?
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, not too bad.
