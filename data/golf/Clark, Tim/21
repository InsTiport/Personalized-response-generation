Q.   You've played a lot of good rounds out here before. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, this surprises me.   I thought I'd shot better rounds than that out there, but it was gettable for me today being firmer, the fairways being firmer anyway, and going off early, the front nine, the greens are somewhat receptive, so I was able to get some birdies early and sort of try and hang on.

Q.   Do you think you could be there tomorrow depending on what everyone does this afternoon?
TIM CLARK:   I don't think I'm going to be that far back to be honest.   Obviously it all depends what the other guys do.   But it is firming up out there.   There's a little bit of wind swirling around.   I feel like I'll be in pretty good shape.

Q.   What was it like play with JosÃ© who has two titles to his name?
TIM CLARK:   It's great playing with JosÃ©.   Obviously I've watched both tournaments that he won as a kid, so it's always exciting to come out with a past champion.   Those are the guys that sort of make this tournament, and it's always fun to be out there with them.

Q.   How do you get your confidence back from putting?   You mentioned you got it back a little bit today?
TIM CLARK:   Well, I certainly didn't practice it.   I just kind of went home and tried to forget about it and just come out with a good attitude again.   I mean, that's all you can do.   The worst thing I could have done yesterday was probably go and practice and grind over it.   I just had to kind of let it go.   I didn't know what to expect today, but I got out and made a few nice putts early, and that's how you get the confidence rolling.

Q.   Did you practice a little bit on the greens?
TIM CLARK:   Not a bit. 

Q.   What are you going to do now?   How do you prepare for the round tomorrow?
TIM CLARK:   I'm probably going to eat some lunch and go home.

Q.   Watch it on TV and see how the other guys are doing?
TIM CLARK:   I may watch a little bit, see how the course plays late this afternoon, but it's going to give me some indication what it's going to do tomorrow.

Q.   You've played some great rounds around here.   Given the reputation that it's a putting contest, do you consider yourself a good putter?
TIM CLARK:   Well, if you watched me yesterday, I think I missed 10 putts inside eight feet yesterday.   I don't believe it's that much of a putting contest out there.   I mean, you've got to hit the ball so good around here, and particularly control your irons.   That's all I really did today.   I played smart shots.   I didn't go at every flag.   Sometimes a great shot for me is 25 feet.   I mean, people don't realize that sometimes that's just as close as you can get it when the pins are put just over the bunkers. 
For me it's really been about the ball‑striking this week.   I've driven it great, hit a lot of fairways and obviously to shoot a round like that you've just got to start to make putts.
