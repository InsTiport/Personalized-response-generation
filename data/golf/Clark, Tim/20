Q.   That stretch of holes, 14 through 18, I watched you play and it didn't seem to take any of your skin off.   Can you talk about that stretch of holes?
TIM CLARK:   Today it wasn't playing horribly long.   I think we had a bit of wind helping.
For me the tough stretch is really 5, that's brutal, and unfortunately I missed my fairways.

Q.   There was speculation that if a big hitter got hot Thursday and Friday, it might be 65 or 62, is there anything like that out there?
TIM CLARK:   There could be.   I shot 70 today and had quite a few putts hit the hole.   On the front I had a couple of chances inside ten feet.   It's possible.   I would have been with two or three under, I think.   I probably played well enough to shoot that.
In order to go to that 5, 6â€‘under, you just can't make any mistakes.   And there's going to be a bogey or two out there. 

Q.   How was the scoring in terms of what was expected? 
TIM CLARK:   Probably not as good, I guess.   Everybody thought under par, and there's really not that many guys going that low.

Q.   How do you like your position right now after one day?
TIM CLARK:   It's good.   More importantly just the way I felt like I played and just in control of everything.   Even par and the way I'm playing, I feel comfortable with that.

Q.   Stopping and starting difficult?
TIM CLARK:   It could have been way worse.

Q.   Advantage to be done with it and have a rest period?
TIM CLARK:   Yeah.   If there's more delays, it's not going to be easy.   Certainly nice to get it done in reasonably good conditions.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
TIM CLARK:   No, no, it was pretty smooth.   We were able to hit a few balls.   No, it was pretty easy.
