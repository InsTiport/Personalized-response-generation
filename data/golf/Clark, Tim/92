 Q.  Regarding the 18th hole. 
 TIM CLARK:  It is extremely tough on the 18th.  I was lucky with the tee shot and 3-iron up.  The putt was tough as I had had to use the slope of the bank.  It was 60 feet.  And I was about eight or nine feet off the green. 
 I putted it and it was like a U-turn.  It went just off the green and came back.  It was exciting, but not as much as the broken shot last year. 

 Q.  Regarding his round. 
 TIM CLARK:  I tried not to make any mistakes.  I was putting cautiously.  I had chances, but I made a lot of good 2-putt pars.  I realized you don't have to go out and attack the golf course, especially on the first day.  The greens are extremely firm.  I tried to give myself easy pars.  I put myself into position to make par.  The bigger hitter will had have a few more chances and can go for a few more. 
 I learned consistent rounds can keep you in with a chance to win on Sunday. 
 Last year gave me a lot more confidence. 

 Q.  Regarding history. 
 TIM CLARK:  Of all the tournaments, this is the one you want to win.  This is obviously a very special place.  I remember watching Jack on TV in 1986 when I was 10.  As a kid I dreamed of just walking and watching this course.  But to be here and play is a dream.  Watching a 2:00 a.m. broadcast in South Africa was just kind of surreal. 
 I'm getting a lot of stiffness, but feel better.
