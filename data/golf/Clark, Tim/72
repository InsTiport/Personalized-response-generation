 Q. You finished 5-under with the ace, what did you hit? 
 TIM CLARK: It was just a wedge, 48. Yeah, I guess that's the best I've ever done on the par 3. I don't think I've ever shot under par, which is quite nice.

 Q. You have a special caddie? 
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, just a friend's son. 

 Q. Did you think the ball was going to stick up there?
 TIM CLARK: It looked like from there, it looked like it almost respond. I made it one year before with a similar-type shot, so I felt if it could just get going, it would have a chance.

 Q. What was your reaction?
 TIM CLARK: Pretty excited. It's nice to get one, especially with the crowd and everyone behind the green.
