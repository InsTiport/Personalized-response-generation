Q.  What would 10 under have done for you?
TIM CLARK:  Certainly at the start of the day on the range, I turned to Luke Donald and we said to each other, if we can post 10, maybe 11, we'll have a chance.

I got off to the best start I could ask for.  I was 5 under through 11.  I maybe felt that I should have birdied 15, and in the end I had a nice look at 17 for birdie, which I wish I would have made that.  I lipped out a fairly good chance on 18, but that putt was breaking a good three yards almost.  It was tough to give myself the distance, knowing that the putt could easily get away from me.  At the end of the day I'm very pleased with 5 under.
Q.  Your thought coming into today, what
TIM CLARK:  Like I said, I felt if I could post 10, 11, you've still got a chance.  17 was playing tough for me all week, and 18 is a tough hole.  I think 9 under is going to be a bit short.  I think it'll probably be a couple back.  Certainly 11 under would have been a great total.
Q.  Is the wind picking up a big factor out there?
TIM CLARK:  All day it's been blowing pretty hard.  On 18 on the second shot it feels like it's calmed down a little bit, but as soon as it gets past the trees, that ball just might kick left.  It's still blowing and it doesn't seem to have died down at all.
Q.  Did you bogey 4?
TIM CLARK:  4, yeah.
Q.  Talk about that hole a little bit.
TIM CLARK:  Again, it's a pretty simple looking hole, but with the wind, myself and Daniel drove it in the rough there and I looked at the people behind us and they were both in the right rough under the tree.  From there you can't even get on the green.

That might be one of the shortest, but it's playing one of the hardest.
