   VIJAY SINGH: I rode Tim all day. He played beautifully, his iron shots were great. It was tough. It was up-and-down. Nobody deserved to lose in that match. Both teams played well, but it's a long day tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What was the key to your play today?  
 TIM CLARK: I've hit the ball good all week and been getting in the fairway and that's giving me a chance to attack some of the flags. I just wish we could make a few more putts, but tomorrow we'll have to do that.   
  
  Q. Magic almost struck twice on 18. Describe the feeling.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, two great putts and both of those I think could have gone in. In the end, it's probably a fitting finish for the match to finish square, but it would have been nice to make one.   
 VIJAY SINGH: It was a good match. Tim played well. He hit a lot of great shots.
