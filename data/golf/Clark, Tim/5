 Q.   3â€‘under, maybe not quite the week you would have liked, but seventh place, so not all about?  
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, I was expecting a lot better.   Unfortunately I just didn't have it on the greens this week.   Couldn't quite get the pace I don't think and it looks like most of the South African guys struggled on the greens.   Maybe we are used to the greens being quicker, I'm not sure.   
Yeah, a little bit disappointed but it's always a fun week to come here.   It's a special week and it's always nice to be included in this field.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of the scoring this week, such a spread leaderboard.   
TIM CLARK:   Very spread.   Obviously you have a guy who is playing extremely well up top there and firing on all parts of his game.   If you do that in a smaller field like this, you can run away with it, like it looks like he's going to do.   
Yeah, spread out but it's a tough golf course.   If you're not playing great, you're going to struggle and if you're playing good and not quite putting great, you're going to kind of finish where I did, middle of the pack.  
   
 Q.   And hopefully one of these years, a South African is going to win it once again.   
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, obviously it's going to happen at some point but yeah, just wasn't this year.
