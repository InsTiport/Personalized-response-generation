Q.  Tomorrow, who do you think you should play against
TIM CLARK:  I think that's the least of our worries.  We have to go out and win eight other matches.  So regardless of who plays Tiger, there's a whole team out there and each of us has to beat our player tomorrow.
Q.  Your thoughts on the afternoon round, the crowds, obviously they are for the U.S., are they being fair in their rooting?
TIM CLARK:  Well, that's what you expect.
Q.  What a great round this afternoon.
TIM CLARK:  We really combined well.  I think if not for Mark, we would have been in some trouble today.  We made a great pair.
Q.  The American fans, it's not the names like Tiger and Vijay, do you feel like you can sneak up a little bit and maybe make a name for yourself here this week?
TIM CLARK:  Here there's only 24 guys, so it's a little bit tough, but that's fine with us.  We know our role on the team and we can come out here against two guys and sneak a win, it kind of catches the other team by surprise.
Q.  The single matches tomorrow, it's always so close.
TIM CLARK:  Yeah, it's always going to, no matter what lead you have.

We knew starting the week come Sunday that's where we really have to play our best golf and I think the guys are ready.
Q.  On singles, your thoughts?

MARK HENSBY:  It's going to be exciting.
