  Q.  Tim, talk about that start, one, two, birdies to get it going and a 50-footer thrown in there to boot.   
 TIM CLARK:  Yeah, it was a great start.  I mean, I put myself right up there one off the lead early on, and just couldn't keep it going.  I did make some good par saves in the middle there, but the scoring holes I feel like are 8, 9, 10, 11, and I just didn't make any birdies there, so that kind of hurt.  But overall 4-under is still a good round, but it could have been one of those great rounds.   
  
  Q.  You love this golf course.  This is I think five in a row in the 60s?   
 TIM CLARK:  Yeah, I like the course.  You know, there's an emphasis on hitting it straight and it's not all about length.  I always enjoy coming here and feel like it's a good course for me.   
  
  Q.  Are you playing the FedExCup numbers game a little bit?  You were on the outside coming into the tournament, but if things finished up the way they are right now, you'd be on the inside and playing next week.  Are you playing that game?   
 TIM CLARK:  I'm kind of looking at it, but you can't really tell what's going to happen until the week is over.  I know I need to play well tomorrow.  If I can finish staying where I am or finish higher, I know I'll have no problem getting in there.  I'd like to play next week, but I'm just going to take it one step at a time.   
  
  Q.  What is the key for you on Sunday?   
 TIM CLARK:  Again, another low round.  I see the leaders are up to 13, maybe 14.  Just as low as I can go tomorrow.
