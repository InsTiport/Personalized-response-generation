Q.   Five birdies, three bogeys to finish 2‑under for the round.   Conditions tough out there today? 
TIM CLARK:   It's always a little bit tricky around here with some wind, but I played great.   Unfortunately bogeys with three three‑putts, two of them, so that's a bit disappointing.   But I'm obviously still right there in position.

Q.   What do you look forward to going into the third round tomorrow?
TIM CLARK:   Well, for me it's just nice to have made a cut.   I mean, it's been a tough year, so to be in contention, but I'm feeling good, too, about it.   Yeah, I'm excited about the weekend.
