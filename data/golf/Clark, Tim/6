Q.   Presumably you're proud with your efforts across the week? 
TIM CLARK:   Never expected to be in that position start of the week.   I fought hard.   I knew I needed to birdie that playoff, especially with him being able to reach. 
I'm pleased overall.   Obviously disappointed to be that close. 

Q.   The way you started today, it's a remarkable run on that back nine to even get that close. 
TIM CLARK:   I had a few shaky holes there on the front nine.   I was playing good‑‑ I felt like I was playing good and putting good, too.   That was a shame.   From there, it was always going to be tough but I managed to get myself into the playoff.

Q.   Funny game, you've written your chances off throughout the week haven't you?
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, you probably play better when it's like that and you're not expecting a whole lot.   I just tried to play this course smart and in the end it was enough to give me a shout. 

Q.   Can you give an appreciation of the man that's won this tournament after that bunker shot at 18 and then the playoff? 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, that's an incredible shot that he pulled off on 18.   And when it hit the green it looked like it was going in.   So you know, you never expect that to happen but I was in a position where I knew I needed to make my putt to get in a playoff.   I just needed to play the playoff hole better.

Q.   To play that birdie putt on the back of that bunker shot was quite something for yourself. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, I guess he likes that hole.

Q.   What's next for you? 
TIM CLARK:   I'm not sure.   I think I'm probably done till Hawai'i but I'm not sure.
