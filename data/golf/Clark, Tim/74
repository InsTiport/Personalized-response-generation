 Q. Did you hit each shot the way you wanted, was anything different today?
 TIM CLARK: I think yesterday obviously playing on so much adrenaline it's tough to come out today. And I just felt a little bit flat. Rory played really well. He's obviously a tremendous talent and I was very impressed with his game. 
 So it was tough for me. I just, the excitement obviously wasn't quite there and I just didn't hit enough good shots. I missed a lot of fairways today, whereas yesterday I didn't do that. And I made -- I don't know really the reason for that. 
 But it would have been tough for me to beat Rory today.

 Q. You played with Tiger a lot, is there a drop off, does he take out energy from guys that play the next day?
 TIM CLARK: I think so. Like I say, there was so much adrenaline out there yesterday, so much focus required that coming out today it was tough to get motivated. Obviously it's a big deal coming out today, but it's tough to feel the same and it's tough to maybe get focused. But, yeah, I think you go around with him and it's tough to come out the next day and get into the battle again.
