  Q.  First, talk about the round today and how it felt out there and just a couple thoughts on the round.   
 TIM CLARK:  Obviously I'm very happy, but this is a low-scoring sort of tournament.  It's my first time playing here, so I'm not quite sure how low it's going to go.  But at least with that score I've kind of kept pace with the leaders.   
  
  Q.  And talk about coming back from the injury, how it feels, and how it felt coming back today.   
 TIM CLARK:  Yeah, I mean, I'm still struggling with it.  I'm still not back to 100 percent.  It's week to week.   
 Luckily when I've come out, I've seemed to have played pretty well.  But it's tough not being able to practice at home and stuff like that.  I don't ever really feel quite prepared.
