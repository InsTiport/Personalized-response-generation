  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 TIM CLARK: I was pretty calm when I had to stand over it, but we were pretty safe on that hole. We couldn't lose the hole, which was a good thing.   
 VIJAY SINGH: It was a close match all day. They chipped in three times and we didn't make much today, but we hung in there. That was the key I think and we hung in there.  
  
  Q. It didn't look very good for a long time here today, there was an awful lot of American flags, but you grinded it out and rallied. How did they manage to come back and stick with it?   
 GREG NORMAN: I just told the guys, look forward and don't look back. You just have to get that momentum going. Just get a bit of momentum, mojo and it's going to go your way. Extremely proud of them.   
  
  Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, have you decided who will not play?   
 GREG NORMAN: I've got a few thoughts in my mind, so we will just have to see how it plays out.   
  
  
VIJAY SINGH: They played well, as well. We just hung in there and we knew we were getting in the middle of the fairway, and if we just don't give up holes we would be okay. We played well. We were 7- or 8-under and I think they did the same. That was a big one for us.   
  
  Q. What are you looking forward to tomorrow?   
 VIJAY SINGH: We just have to go in and see who is going to be playing and who is going to be our partner.   
  
  Q. I know it's up to the captain, but you're playing solid right now.   
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, today I certainly hit the ball a lot better. I don't know, it just depends how it's going to work out with the formats tomorrow, if I play in the morning or afternoon. Either way, just see what the team needs.
