   TIM CLARK: I don't know, you've got to play good golf against these guys. Today I felt a lot better than yesterday. I just felt like I played really well. I knew Martin was going to be a really tough match. No holes were given away out there. It was a good match.

 Q. Tell me about the colored ball. 
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, it's interesting. And it's been going well. So no reason for me to switch back to the white one. It's easy to pick up in the sun. And especially on the fairways and that. And it's going in the holes.

 Q. You said this course doesn't really suit you. 
 TIM CLARK: I was able to get a few shots close today. I think I'm coming in with less iron than I normally would, so it's a little bit easier on myself. 

 Q. You're close to top form?
 TIM CLARK: I feel like my game right now is better than last week, sure. I'm close to top form for me, which is really good. 

 Q. I heard you call the ball green, what color is it?
 TIM CLARK: I guess it's yellow.
