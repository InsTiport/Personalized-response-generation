 Q. Disappointing, but a solid tournament, nonetheless. 
 TIM CLARK: Yeah. I mean just not a good weekend, I guess. 
 I had chances. And 20 or 30s coming down the stretch, and 17 just sort of derailed me. What I put was a perfect tee shot and had no play. So disappointing finish, but yeah.

 Q. I know you never want to blame the conditions, you take full credit and responsibility for your shots, but just seemed like you caught a couple bad breaks there when you hit it off the fairway coming down the stretch. 
 TIM CLARK: Yeah. I mean that just seems to be what happens. Without having too much power, if I do miss the fairway, I invariably have a tough time, so a little bit frustrated. I just needed to make a run at it, and I thought if I put a couple birdies out there the last few holes, I'd maybe have a chance. 

 Q. Tim, great tournament. Good playing. Thank you. 
 TIM CLARK: Thank you.
