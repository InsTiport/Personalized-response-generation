Q.  Tell us about your secret weapon today.

ERNIE ELS:  That's what he was today, a great weapon.  It was great to watch from my side.  I think I helped him on three holes all day.  He was on fire from the first hole putting for birdies and really putting Tiger and Charles under pressure from the get-go-go.  He's a great player.  He's got a great future ahead of him as I said before.


Q.  How nervous at the start were you, playing with Ernie, playing with Tiger, playing with Charles Howell? 

TIM CLARK:  I was pretty comfortable knowing that I had Ernie as my partner.  I knew I had someone there by my side.  I got off to a good start.  He hit a good shot in on the first and that was it.  I felt comfortable right from then.
