  TIM CLARK:   I wasn't expecting to probably be where I am right now, so very happy with the first two rounds.

Q.   Does it help that perhaps you've got lower expectations of the event, sometimes? 
TIM CLARK:   Possibly.   But like I said yesterday, we're here, so you want to put out your best effort.   Certainly still trying very hard but I think I've just sort of managed the course pretty well. 
It's obviously very long but I've tried to make sure that I'll be in the fairway, even though it's leaving me longer shots in, I'm not trying to sort of bite off more than I can chew.

Q.   I know it's the trick most weeks, but fairways and greens gets the job done, doesn't it?
TIM CLARK:   Well, particularly here.   This rough is thick, and you know, if the longer guys go in there, it makes it tougher for them to hit the greens.   That's pretty much been my strategy.

Q.   Any highlight or have you impressed yourself with the way course management worked?
TIM CLARK:   Not really but I've made some putts, which is good.   I made a bunch of birdies and then it's tough to save par out here.   I made four bogeys yesterday but today I was a little bit better with that. 

Q.   In a sense, that's half the battle, isn't it, really, just to make sure those bogeys don't go on the card?
TIM CLARK:   For sure.   It's a really tough course, and you get out of position, it's tough to save par.   But you know, I've managed to do that well today and like I say when you're making a bunch of birdies, you want to try to keep your rounds together.

Q.   Now up there for the weekend, presumably the normal competitive spirit comes into play. 
TIM CLARK:   Exactly, but still, on a course like this, one of the guys can get going that are further back and play themselves right back in the tournament tomorrow.   So just got to keep going.
