Q.   You're out in 3‑under, you come home in 3‑under, shoot 6‑under 64. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, obviously a great way to start the year.   Not a whole lot of expectations coming down, but I always enjoy the start of the year.   I love coming out here to Hawai'i.   It's just such a great place, and obviously a course that I really like and have played well at in the past.   For me it's just a great way to get the year started.

Q.   Everyone wonders about your health.   You're coming off a serious injury a couple years ago, you played 20 events last season.   I thought it was almost an entire year finding out how healthy you were. 
TIM CLARK:   It was really, and towards the end I started to play some good golf.   But it's going to be an exciting year for me because I do feel like I'm healthy again and can play a full schedule and play.   Yeah, I'm obviously doing a lot better than I was last year.

Q.   Have you looked at the leaderboard?   Do you see what the kids are doing?   There's a couple rookies up on top. 
TIM CLARK:   Yeah, it's good to see.   I probably haven't as much, don't even know a lot of the new names.   But it just seems like the last few years there's been so many more younger guys and new guys out here on TOUR, it seems to be changing face, and yeah, it's going to be exciting to watch some of these guys play.
