   TIM CLARK: A bit tough today. As this course firms up, it's extremely hard for me. I just never felt like I had many birdie chances. I was struggling all day.   
 And it seemed the same last year, after two rounds. I just struggled when it gets firm. I just think in general the course got tougher. I'm not sure about the scoring out there, so it's hard for me to judge.  
  
  Q. Obviously 17 was a lot longer today?  
 TIM CLARK: Yeah, I had 215 into the wind. I was trying to hit some sort of hybrid up in there.  
 Wednesday I struggled. 14 uphill I had wedge then 25 feet back down the hill for my putt.   
  
  Q. Twice you played here (inaudible.) What about this year --  
 TIM CLARK: Each match is different. My match against Vijay I was almost, you know, way more nervous than I was against Tiger for some reason, but I got through that match. And yesterday I played great against Ross McGowan. It all depends. It's all day-to-day, really.   
 You wake up one morning, and you either feel good or you don't feel good, it doesn't matter whether you're playing Tiger or someone else in the field. Obviously I felt over the years I've been able to play pretty well, playing with Tiger or against Tiger. I don't lie awake at night worrying about it.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 TIM CLARK: I'm not playing next week, actually.  
  
  Q. You're not? Are you still based out here?  
 TIM CLARK: Yeah.
