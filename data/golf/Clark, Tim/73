  Q. Are you going to hear about this from every guy you see on the way to the tee tomorrow?  
 TIM CLARK: Not really. I don't think the guys are that cruel. To win this is something I will have forever. Like I say, I'm not one who believes in superstition. I believe it's merely coincidence that the winner has not gone on to win. Obviously it's extremely tough to win on Augusta National. I've got my work cut out. It's a great way to start the week certainly and I come here to have funs and this is certainly a fun event.   
 9, I think it's my second one in two years on this hole, it's been good to me. Very exciting finish. I figured I needed to make it to have a chance to win.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us about the shot, what you saw and when you knew it was in?   
 TIM CLARK: It was a pitching wedge for me. It literally went straight over the flag and looked like it had stopped on the slope behind the hole, and it sort of waited at least ten seconds before it started back down and then checked straight into the hole.  
  
  Q. We have had guys knock balls into the water on purpose, and to not win this, are you walking up thinking --  
 TIM CLARK: I'm trying to make it. Like I said, it's an honor to be here. Augusta National have us every year, and this is part of the tournament, so, yeah, I like to come out and give it my best.
