 Q.   That was very good, 7‑under today, and 8‑under for the tournament.   What was the key to the round?  
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   Today putting, really good.   Hit same, hit good.   Probably 18 a bit lucky, pin, come back.  
   
 Q.   Conditions today good for scoring?   
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   Conditions really good but some hole for me, long hole, nine and three and four, cannot leave near pin, and long putt in, two more holes, really long, maybe 15 yards.  
   
 Q.   You must be very happy to be in contention again; maybe try to win third time for the year.   
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   I try.   I don't know, tomorrow, if I hit good, okay.   But if I don't hit good, don't know.   Cannot say.   
   
 Q.   At the start of the week you were complaining about your wrist.   Did you think that you could play on Thursday or what was happening?   You didn't play Pro‑Am?  
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   No, cannot ‑‑ my hand cannot turn.   Talk no need putting, everything, no need golf one day.   
   
 Q.   And Thursday morning?  
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   Feel better a little bit and then finish game, first day, after massage, again really good and Friday really good.  
   
 Q.   Confident for tomorrow?  
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   Tomorrow, I don't want to say.   Wind come, cannot‑‑ same, I don't know.  
   
 Q.   You've won 18 times on the Asian Tour, two this season.   When players see your name on the leaderboard, do they think, oohh, maybe they have pressure on them?  
    THAWORN WIRATCHANT:   I don't know.   I want 20.
