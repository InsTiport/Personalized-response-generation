Q. An incredible round, 7-under at the Old Course.  How do you feel after that?
THAWORN WIRATCHANT: Incredible.  I didn't think I could play like this.  Incredible.
Q. A bogey on 17 but a great way to finish with a birdie on 18.
THAWORN WIRATCHANT: The 17th hole is the most difficult hole, and I tried to play my best at this hole.  That bogey is not like hurting so much, so I just paid attention.  It was an accident on that hole, putting by myself.  It's not exciting, but just an accident.
Q. What parts of your game suited the course?  What were you most happy with with your play today?
THAWORN WIRATCHANT: Maybe putting, I'm not sure which part of my game suits this course because all skills are very difficult.  But today, very perfect, every shot, perfect.  Only two holes, 3-putt, but that is like normal with this course.
