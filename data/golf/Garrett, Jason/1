  JASON GARRETT:   Well, I think that's important every week, obviously.   I thought we did a good job on that first drive.   Brought it down a little bit there to force us to have to kick a field goal, and then they came down and scored.   
The big take away down in the plus territory was huge for us.   I thought that was the play early on in the game that really swung the tide.   And then we did a good job taking advantage of that and knocking it in for a touchdown.   And I think we played a pretty solid food ball game after that.   Making stops on defense, moving the ball, throwing it, and getting the running game going.   
I thought the balance was good throughout most of the game, offensively, and as the game wore on, the defense did a really good job continuing to make stops on third down.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   I thought Tony was really good.   Obviously, he missed the one early on to Whit, that was a great opportunity for us.  
But really besides that, I thought he played a really good ball game.   Really looked like he saw the field well, took some opportunities to throw the ball down the field and make some big plays to Dez.   
And then when he got opportunities to throw the ball underneath, I thought he delivered the ball well.   And the run after catch was big in this game.   Dez really made a couple of great plays for us.   Plays that kind of changed the game.   
When you catch the ball five yards down the field, and you make the run that he makes, and then the play down the sidelines, those are huge for us.   Those are the difference‑making plays that allowed us to get ahead.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   I think we've actually been a pretty good screen team and draw team all year long.   They certainly have a good pass rush.   Those guys wants to get up the field, that's part of their DNA as a defense, is those guys up the field.   
So, you want to combat that, you want to use their aggressiveness against them.   The screens and the draws are ways to do that.   
   
 Q.   Did you take about taking Tony out before you did or (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   I felt there was opportunities in the second half that we didn't cash in on.   We made some stops on defense, and offensively, and we bogged down on a couple different occasions.   
So, that's something we have to look at and correct and improve upon.   I think we took him out probably in the right time.   Certainly in your head, four scores in a game, you start to think about that a little bit.   
But at the same time, this is the NFL and teams can come back and things can turn really quickly.   So, I thought we managed that the right way, getting him out.   I don't know, with about six or seven minutes to go give Brandon a chance to play.   Same thing with Demarco, same thing with Dez.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, he did fine.   He seemed fine.   Again, I thought he played well in the game.   Didn't look like he had any physical restrictions.   Moved around in the pocket, some subtle pack pocket movements to allow things to develop, which I thought were important.   He really looked like himself.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, I thought he played well.   They play a single high style of defense.   So, that typically gives the outside receiver an opportunity to go one and one.   
So we took advantage of that a little bit.   And again, on the drag route that he caught underneath it, he did a great job breaking tackles and really running with reckless abandon.   
And it was a heck of a play and really a game changing play for us.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   I thought it was fantastic.   I can't tell you how great a week that we had as a football team.   I could go day‑by‑day and tell you all the experiences we had.  
It was really important to focus as a team coming over here and dealing with the distractions.   
But along the way, we had opportunities to interact with a lot of different people and everybody was fantastic.   So welcoming and so accommodating to us.   I think the spirit of the NFL is catching fire over here and in a real positive way.   I think we have benefited a lot from it.   
So, we really had a productive week.   People couldn't have been nicer.   Our team did a good job going to work.   That was a huge deal for us, a huge point of emphasis by our entire coaching staff to make sure we come over here and handle the distractions of travel and getting yourself adjusted and just going to work.   
We practiced well on Wednesday, and we practiced well on Thursday, and we practiced well on Friday, and for the most part we did a good job today.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, again we have been here before.   I literally came here 24 years ago and played in a preseason game with the New Orleans Saints and it seems like a lifetime ago, but at the same time coming into this stadium it seems like yesterday.   A number of teams have come over through the years and everybody we talked to players and coaches, everybody associated with the teams, they just have such great experiences here and again the fans are really excited about it, they're welcoming, it seems like they want to learn football and it's fun for us to be a part of a game like this.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   That's what Dez does, he does a really nice job.   He's been working hard in practice and trying to take advantage of the opportunities when he gets them.   He's done a nice job all year long when he's gotten chances running the football and today might have been the best one he had.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   We had one bed check last night, it was 10 o'clock, we had everybody there.   So anything else you heard‑‑ there were a lot of great Winston Churchill's quotes, we heard a few of these, a lie makes it halfway around the world before truth can get out of bed and put its pants on.   We had one bed check last night and everybody was fine.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, big challenge for everybody in the NFL every week is to focus at the task at hand and regardless of what happened the previous week, you got to do everything you can to be your best and win a game this week.   And I thought our team did a good job of that.   
You just move on you.   You move on from the last one, whether it was a success or some kind of adversity.   And I thought our team did a really good job having the right approach, the right mentality, the right mindset, coming into this game, reflected in the work that we had over here and our performance today.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Well, we wanted to work Rolando out before the game and see if he could be available to dress.   He didn't practice all week long.   He started feeling better yesterday.   So we thought that was a good move for our team, to dress him and if we needed him as the game wore on, to play him.   But not play him that much.   It was going to be about a 15 play maximum, and it turned out that we didn't need him to play.   
I thought Hicks did a good job in the game.   He's getting more and more comfortable, more and more confident playing that spot.   He has versatility, he's played a couple different spots for us and seems to handle it well.   And he, like everybody else, we're going to watch the tape and there's going to be some things that we don't like, but he seems comfortable out there and he's going more and more confident.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Absolutely.   There's some things up to this point that have been real positive for us and things that have been disappointed by.   But for the most part over the course of the first 10 weeks we feel good about the position that we're in.   
But we talked to our team after the game, the only easy day was yesterday.   Fortunately, there's time for to us get healed up a little bit.   We go back to Texas and get some guys back feeling a hundred percent and get ready for the next challenge of beating New York in a couple of weeks.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   No, I wouldn't describe it as a sprint.   I don't think anybody would.   
Really the issue there was I thought he went down the first time, and then I thought he went down the second time.   We were trying to get a timeout called because I think they were just over 30 seconds when we snapped that ball.   
So, obviously, you want to preserve the time as quickly as you can.   But he stayed up and he stayed up again and got in.   
And we're using those cords today.   Typically we're wireless on the sidelines.   So we had a couple instances where I got kind of pulled back a little bit and that was one of them for me.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, I thought that was a big sequence for us.   We had an opportunity before that in two minute, where the ball came out and Cole Beasley caught that ball in the middle.   And then they get a stop on defense and come back and take advantage of that opportunity, that was big.   
They gave us an opportunity outside with Dez, and Tony and Dez made the play.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Yeah, the disappointing drive was early on when they were able to convert a couple third downs, and they made the run for the town touchdown.   
But I thought they responded well after that.   Using the rotation on the defensive line, and it seemed like those guys did a good job pressuring the quarterback throughout the game.   And for the most part, did a good job quieting that run game down.   
We made a number of good stops throughout the game.   At the end, it got a little, we got one more time, but we had an opportunity to get some younger guys in there to play.   
So we'll go back and watch the tape, evaluate guys.   But for the most part, defense did a good job today.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Other areas?   Yeah, every area.   Again, there were some good things in the game, but we'll go back and watch everything and there's a lot of room for improvement.   
I do think we responded well at different times in this game.   From making stops and defense, cashing in on opportunities, offensively, to score some touchdowns at critical points in the game.   
But it's never good enough.   You have to have a real mentality of being a hungry football team.   That's the way you have to look at it.   And we, as coaches, that's our job to make sure that we get it right.   We'll certainly do that when we get back to Texas this week.  
   
 Q.   Did you see what happened on the field goal?  
JASON GARRETT:   I didn't see it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JASON GARRETT:   Good to see you guys, thanks for the great week.
