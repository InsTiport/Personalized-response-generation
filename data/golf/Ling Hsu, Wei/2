Q. Great round today.  4-under par.  Tell us how you're feeling right now.
WEI LING HSU: Feel great.  Maybe a little nervous.  When I walking on 16 tee box I saw I'm tied for third.  I was like, Whoa, better than I thought.
And 16 kind of over the water and tough pin; kind of nervous the last three hole.
But overall, pretty good.
Q. During the week you've been playing the golf course pretty much dry.  We've had some rain yesterday and this morning.  How is the course playing out there when you played this morning?
WEI LING HSU: It's rain couple -- first couple hole, like first five or six hole.  I kind of just tell myself, Just be patient.  This course is really hard, especially on the green.
So I just make sure my tee shot, put it in a good position, and I was able to get on the green hopefully as close as I can.
But just stay patient.
Q. You tied fifth in the US Open this year.  Do you prep differently for the majors at all?
WEI LING HSU: I think I like the very challenge course because I'm not that kind of player that really hitting bunch of birdie.  I kind of just stay patient.  Like US Open is hard course, too, and this one as well.
This is my third time here, and past two time I didn't have a really good result.  This time I kind of -- I just want to be patient.  I know so many girl out here are very like difficult to play this course, so kind of just stay patient.  Everything just stay patient.
Q. As of now you are two shots off the lead.  What is your game plan for the weekend?
WEI LING HSU: Oh, stay patient.  I mean, a little bit challenge for me is I always get nerves when I'm top of the leaderboard.
So I was hoping my rest of day, rest of today I can just be brave and don't be too scared and kind of slow down the swing.
So I think that's just my target.  I'm not really think about position or whatever.
