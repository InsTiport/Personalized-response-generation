  Q. Can you comment on being in Ken Green's group?  
 MORRIS HATALSKY: Well, oh, sure. Well, first and foremost, I thought it was a privilege to play with Ken, from just a, from a perspective of him being as courageous as he is, because you know he's been, he is playing in a lot of pain.   
 But he's courageous and he just represents all the good things in the human spirit, in terms of trying to still be the best that he can be at this point in time.   
 And he's very gracious out there. And he said something that I thought was, we had a, we had kind of a good laugh, he said before he used to get real upset because of maybe an easier hole and just kind of give something away; whereas every hole is a tough hole for him. And so he appreciates each and every shot, each and everything that he does.   
 And so it's very inspiring for me from a personal standpoint to see him give everything he has out there and just be who he is. It was a really good two days to be a part of that.
