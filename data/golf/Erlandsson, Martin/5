MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Started out a little bit intense but I managed to get an early birdie, and from there on, I tried to relax a bit.  I had a good swing today.
Q.  Nervous?  Come on, you've been in this position before.
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  It's always tickling a little bit.  Especially if you feel the game is getting better and better, you don't mess it up, sort of bad thoughts.
Q.  The early birdies helped, but how do you deal with those nerves, do you just concentrate on what you're doing, one shot at a time, the old cliche?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Well, I'm trying to do that, do my thing, do what I'm practising.  I'm trying to do that with the game all the time, yeah, and not worry too much.  That's the key for me I think.
Q.  You said the greens were good the first day, putting was good again?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Putting was good today.  I holed a few that I didn't think would go in, so I'm happy about that.  But they are holding up pretty good.
Q.  It's been a marvelous year for the Swedes, hasn't it?  No doubt you're fully aware of that.
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Yeah, it's good to see that your friends are playing well and that it's not impossible.  That's what I try to take out of it.
Q.  Do you have good friendships with your fellow countrymen?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Yeah, definitely, we have a good team of guys giving each other some support, yeah, so it's good.
Q.  Inaudible?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  It's a little bit similar to the courses that we are used to back home.
Q.  Could you explain that?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Well, it's green and it's a little bit damp and it's the same grass and greens are similar.  I like it around here.
Q.  Looks like you and Mattias will be playing together tomorrow.
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Yeah, it's nice to see him up there as well.  We're from the same club and everything, so I know him good.  Hopefully I'll play with him, but I'm not sure though, maybe.
Q.  How will the nerves be then for the weekend in this position?
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Well, I'm trying to learn from the experience.  I've been there a few times before.  Experience is always good.
