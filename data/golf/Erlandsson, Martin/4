   RODDY WILLIAMS:  The 63 is a course record, lowest opening round ever at The Belfry, you must be pretty pleased? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Yeah, I don't think I missed one shot.  I was playing pretty -- I don't think I missed any shot today.  I was really spot-on with my swing, so I felt really, really happy about it because I've been working a lot with it. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  As good as you've ever played? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Must be.  Must be.  I was very much in the present, as well.  My caddie reminded me all the time to stay focused and stay where you are and do what you can do.  It was brilliant. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  The last month or so you've really turned your season around, haven't you? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  From Scandinavian Masters onwards, I had a couple of good Sundays with the scores building up.  Those are very nice.  And my card is very secure, so I can play.  It's a very different game to play when you know you're 76th on the Order of Merit and can only get better.  That's a good feeling. 

 Q.  Have you ever had a 29 on the front nine? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  No, that's the first time I think.  I was thinking 34 par maybe, but not a 36-par, a 29. 

 Q.  What happened with the eagle on 3? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  I chipped it in from behind the green. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  How far was the chip-in? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Six-meter chip maybe. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Might as well run through the other birdies, as well. 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  4 was a nice putt from four meters. 
 6, I was staying very focused on staying patient and I made a nice putt from four metres. 
 And then a long one on 7 from eight metres maybe. 
 And very nice shots on 8 and 9 up to three metres, three, four-meter putts. 

 Q.  Those holes were key -- 
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Yes, definitely.  6, 7,8, 9 were key holes. 

 Q.  And what happened on 8 and 9? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  8, I played 7-iron and then 5-iron up. 
 I had a very good start.  I had a tap-in birdie on 10. 
 12, that's a long putt, a 10- or 12-metre putt on 12. 
 And then played pretty steady and 3-putted 17.  That was maybe the only mistake today that I can say was a mistake.  Otherwise it was pretty spot-on. 

 Q.  (How much is it a relief to not worry about your card)? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  No, it's a little bit more like relaxed and enjoying to play and I can really start doing -- taking the practice out on the course.  I feel more comfortable now with all of the work I've done and I can bring it to the course, which is a fantastic feeling to really relax. 

 Q.  Best round you've ever had? 
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Must be the best one, yeah. 

 Q.  Who will be the first person you call? 
MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  My wife, yeah. 

 Q.  Is this the first year since you have been on Tour that you have not had to worry about your card at this time of the year? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  This is my fourth season. 

 Q.  But you haven't had to worry about your card? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Was it two years ago, or three years ago -- two years ago in Wales, I finished second there.  And from there I could play out fully as well.  I didn't know if I had some changes I had needed to do to really become competitive, so I started to do them that season.  And hopefully now it's getting better and better. 

 Q.  Was it other players who told you that? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Well, not the players.  I heard it for many years from home and the teaching pros at home and friends and so on. 

 Q.  What's the main change that you've made? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Getting a better, strong flight and better, strong sort of swing, with stronger shots I'm getting more control with my draw flight.  Usually I'm just a fade and now I'm more a weak fade, I was playing all the time and it wasn't that good in the wind and so on. 

 Q.  Have you played well here before? 
 MARTIN ERLANDSSON:  Was it last year I missed the cut, or the year before?  It was played here last year, right?  Yeah, I missed the cut.
