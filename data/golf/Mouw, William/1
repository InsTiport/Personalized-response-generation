Q. 2-down at one point in the match, had to win 18 to force extra holes. Talk about a little bit how everything unfolded.
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, so yesterday I was down three, as well, too, and I just knew if I could keep hitting greens, keep putting the pressure on him and make him have the pressure and stuff like that, one shot at a time, don't get ahead of yourself -- he made a good birdie putt on 16 and obviously put the pressure back on me, but I just said, one shot at a time here, and it ended up working out good, yeah.
Q. No. 18 he hit his wedge shot first, nobody clapped. What's your thought standing over the ball? Do you know you have to hit it close?
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, so I saw him hit a perfect wedge shot. The greens are real firm this week, but I saw it in the back of the green, and it was going to be a real tough up-and-down. So I just said, okay, I just want to give myself here about 10 feet below the hole. We did just that, and we gave it a chance, but it snapped. Fortunately he missed his putt and I made mine, so that was good.
Q. You played him in the round of 32 just a few weeks ago in the Junior Amateur.
WILLIAM MOUW: I did, yeah.
Q. When you've played an opponent so recently, do you know anything in addition?
WILLIAM MOUW: I did. I learned a lot. I was 2-down through 11 going back to the Junior Am, and I think I was 2-down through whatever here, and I forced a lot more at the junior amateur because I felt like I had to come back from it. I learned a lot from that, and just felt like if I just keep hitting good golf shots, that'll do the job, and I just made some good putts coming down the end there, too.
Q. What do you do with the quick turnaround to be ready for the afternoon?
WILLIAM MOUW: Get some food, get some rest, drink some water and mentally prepare, and we should be good. Hit a couple putts.
