 Q.  All square for the first couple holes.  
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  Just talk about the match a little bit.  
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, you know, I was going into 2, hit a good shot there.  I was above the hole.  No, it was 3.  3 I was above the hole and I had about 15 feet.  It's got to be the quickest putt in the United States.  It was so fast.  Just got myself in a bad position there.   
And then on the next hole, so fast as well.  So I kind of had 3 and 4 were just very unlucky in spots to be.   
5, hit a good shot and spun back.  He got a shot there on me.   
I mean, we were right in it.  He was 1-up through like the first seven holes, so there is the first couple holes.   
 Q.  What is your biggest takeaway from this experience?  
WILLIAM MOUW: I learned a lot.  It was a grind, but I love playing against great competition.  I love to compete.  Yeah, it was a fun week.  Even though I didn't have my best stuff, I managed to get in the round of 32 in my first USGA event.  It's fun.  I'll be back.  I'll be back for sure.
