Q. All right, so you didn't trail at all today.  How did that feel?
WILLIAM MOUW: Felt good.  I put myself in some pretty good spots where I can attack; put myself below the hole today and hit some fairways, which was nice.
Q. You had a really strong start leading right away.  Take me through that.
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, I didn't play too well in stroke play, but knew as long as I get to match play tables will turn.
Yeah, again, hit some fairways and hit some greens and finally made some putts.  My caddie, Rick, gave me some good reads and I hit the lines and made 'em.
Q. Awesome.  And you birdied back to back 8 and 9.  Can you walk me through those holes?
WILLIAM MOUW: Yeah, I did.  8 I hit a good drive just down there on the left side of the fairway.  Hit a 3-irin into the bunker and made a nice 10-footer up the hill.
Couple balls out left.  Rick gave me a good read and hole 9 was driveable, but I didn't hit driver.  I hit 3-iron off the tee.  It a 60 in there to about eight feet, and another good read and I made it.
Q. What's your mindset going into the round of 32?
WILLIAM MOUW: Hit fairways, hit greens, give myself chances.  Focus on me, just me and my caddie, and one shot at a time and see what happens.
