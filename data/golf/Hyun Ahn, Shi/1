Q. Welcome back to the LPGA.  You haven't played in a major in quite a while.  How did it feel to be out there again on this golf course?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Leading up to here and performing in a major, I just wanted to not play with any nerves or anxiety.
Q. What made you decide to try to qualify for this?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  I really wanted to come and play the Evian Championship.
Q. Can you catch us up on life since you played full time on the LPGA?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  I just didn't want to play full time on the LPGA.  Just wanted to have more of a relaxed schedule.
Q. Did you want to be closer to family?  What were the main reasons that you left the LPGA?
SHI HYUN AHN: As I was on the LPGA and traveling everywhere it got very lonely and I struggled a little bit, and so I really enjoy my life in Korea.
Q. Do you have family?  Do you have a kid or married or...
SHI HYUN AHN: I have a daughter.
Q. What's her name?
SHI HYUN AHN: Grace.
Q. Grace?  Hold is she?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Seven.
Q. Is she here?
SHI HYUN AHN: No.
Q. In France?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  She's in Korea.
Q. The ball incident (indiscernible), sort of fretting and unhappy with the way things were, or did you just take it in your stride?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  I don't really remember.  It was a really long time ago.
Q. Do you remember it being stressful at all, stressful time?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Yeah, it was really stressful.
Q. What were your expectations for the week?  What would you consider to be a good week here at Evian?
SHI HYUN AHN: So I'm really happy to be here.  I wanted to come and I'm here just enjoying my time, so that's kind of how I'm taking this week.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  No.
Q. Have there been any friends or rivals that have seen you this week and been happy to see you again?  Any kind of reaction?  Asking where you've been, what you've been doing last few years?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  So I've been seeing a lot of players that I haven't seen in a long time since I was out here full time.  Players, caddies, a lot of Korean players I hadn't seen in a really long time.
I've just had a really good time just catching up with everybody.
Q. Does your daughter play golf?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  No.
Q. How many players on the KLPGA have kids?  How many moms are there on the KLPGA?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Not a lot.  There is about three to five.  About four moms on tour.
Q. Do they have a creche, a day care?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  No.
Q. Does she travel with you?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  No.
Q. That must be hard.
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  So parents will typically take care of the child while I play, grandparents.
Q. So do the grandparents miss watching your nice golf?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  The grandparents get to see the grandchild either at home, and then if they wants to come to the golf course they'll bring her to the golf course.
Since tournaments in Korea are very close to each other or whether they're close to where I'm home based, it's very easy to travel from tournament to home.
Grandparents will come, and it's easy to get from place to place by car.  So Monday and Tuesday maybe they'll come to the golf course for practice rounds, and then come out for the competition.
So she gets to see her daughter and they get to see my daughter.
Q. Does this say mom?  What does it say on your thing?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Yeah, that's my daughter's name.
Q. How cute.  Anything you missed about the LPGA?
SHI HYUN AHN: (Through translation.)  Yeah, there are things that I missed, but if I were to come out to the LPGA Tour full time it would be very stressful.  I'm here just trying to enjoy my time.
