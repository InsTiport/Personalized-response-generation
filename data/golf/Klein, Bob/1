Q.  How are you feeling about practice today?
BOB KLEIN:  Pretty good for us today.  We had a pretty good time.  The wind wasn't blowing quite as much.  So that was nice.
Q.  Are you pretty confident about going into the tournament tomorrow?
BOB KLEIN:  I'm feeling pretty good.  For a guy whose selling shirts for a living, I'm pretty excited to be out here playing a little golf.
