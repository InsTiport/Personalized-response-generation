Q.   Pleased with the way you played today?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  Yeah, very pleased.  In fact, things really settled down all day.
Q.   Did you have a number coming in here today?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  A couple, 3-under.  The way the course was going to be set up today, you kind of know where the pins are going to be.  There's usually a few surprises.  But there aren't a whole lot of birdie pins out there.  There are a lot of front pins.  Unless you're putting real well, you're not going to have a lot of great birdie chances.
Q.   How was the course playing for you out there?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  It's tough.  I played in the wind all four days.  I had the early lead, we got wind all four days, so it was the same for me all four days in a row.  It's nice to know what clubs I'm hitting.
Q.   It makes Stewart's 64 impressive?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  It's awesome.
Q.   Pleased with the way the week went?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  I played extremely well, extremely well.
Q.   What was your previous best?
