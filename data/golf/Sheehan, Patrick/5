PATRICK SHEEHAN:  I'm very pleased with the way I'm playing.  I'm driving the ball well, hitting some good irons and making some putts.  It feels good.

Q.  What was the key today?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  Key today, I think the key today for me was making a putt on 8.  I bogeyed the 2nd hole, which is a nightmare to bogey.  It's a par 5 and it's reachable.  Kind of going along and making pars and I made a bomb, probably 40, 50 feet for birdie on 8, and I made a bunch of birdies and it kind of got me started after that.

Q.  You had a look of surprise.
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  Well, it's such a long putt and you're just trying to get it close and it goes in, I mean, it happens every now and then, but it doesn't happen a lot.  But those are good momentum builders.

Q.  Talk about how the course is playing.  Going low is going to be key?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  Yeah, I think at this point winning score is going to be 20, maybe not    high teens at least.  The greens I don't see are going to firm up too much for the weekend, but they're soft, and the fairways are really soft, so the fairways are a little wider because they're that soft.  For me, I mean, I'm going to have to shoot a couple of 66s on the weekend at least to have a chance, I think.

Q.  Talking about momentum, how can you ride this into tomorrow and how much does that give you for tomorrow?
PATRICK SHEEHAN:  Well, I feel good right now out there.  Whenever you put two good rounds together you always can use that as a momentum builder.  You know, this course, I like it.  It sets up good for me and it's one of my favorites out here, so that helps, also, when you're playing a golf course.  But this is a tournament where you're going to have to keep going and going low.  Like I said, a couple under each day on the weekend from someone that's behind the lead right now, it's not going to work.
