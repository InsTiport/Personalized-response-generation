 Q. Good experience?
 ERIC LIPPERT: Today was not fun; yeah, it was a blast. Playing with two really great guys. Just couldn't get anything going today. I hit the ball a lot better and couldn't -- things didn't go my way. I just kept missing green after green after green after green and it just kind of got away. 

 Q. What will you take out of this? 
 ERIC LIPPERT: A lot of positives. I actually felt a lot more comfortable than I thought I would be. You know, I think there's a lot to learn, a lot of things, just watching these guys being able to swing the club smooth and easy. They are really, really relaxed and it's good to be in this environment and learn to handle it and get your best out of it I think.

 Q. What will you do the rest of the year?
 ERIC LIPPERT: Rest of the year I will probably go home and relax first. Just work on some tempo and I think a lot of tempo drills and things like that. I see that being more -- you can get away with more with good tempo. Guys like us, we get a little quick, a little ahead of ourselves. In this kind of environment on this kind of golf course, you can't miss-hit the shots that far off-line. It can't be that big of a miss.
