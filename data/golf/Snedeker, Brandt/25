 Q.  Brandt, there's no wind right now, but it was swirling all day.  You're a putting guru, one of the great putters in the world.  How do you try to putt in conditions like this?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It's tough.  You're second-guessing yourself all day.  You hit good putts but if the wind gets them you start playing against yourself all day.  You're going to hit some good shots in some really bad spots and some good putts in bad spots and bad putts in the really bad.  Andy is great.  This is our second time playing against each other.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, I turned into Andy's biggest cheerleader right now.  I need Andy to win his match.  It creates a little more drama on Friday.  Tomorrow me and Branden will be cheering for Andy right in front of us and we'll be battling hard trying to beat each other.   
 Q.  Tell me how tough it is putting when these winds here?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: The putting is really difficult, because you start playing wind, you start second-guessing yourself.  The don't ever commit a hundred percent.  That's not helping the confidence in what's going on.  But I played for the most part really well today.  A few little hiccups here and there that you're going to have on a day like today.   
 Q.  The finish here, that proves anything can happen.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It was totally ugly.  I miss a 3-footer on 16.  I miss a 3-footer on 17.  And then Andy does that and misses one behind me.  It just shows you on these golf courses, the wind is blowing, you never really feel comfortable over any putt.   
We had a good time today.  It was a fun match.  And I'll be cheering really hard tomorrow for Andy when he's playing William.
