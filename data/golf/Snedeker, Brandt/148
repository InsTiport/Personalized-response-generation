 Q.   Sunday, kind of a day where you have to go low, how frustrating was it, especially early on that you guys couldn't seem to get it going?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   (Indiscernible.)   Bunch of good shots, bunch of good putts, and they just seemed to kind of want to stay on the edges.   
It happens.   (Indiscernible.)   Out of the way today, so looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Davis, you finally got the momentum going and the storm comes in.   Was that the last thing you guys were looking for?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Yeah, finally started making some birdies and we had to stop.   We had a rough par‑5 when we came back and didn't make a birdie.  
(Indiscernible) I hit the wrong club three or four times and had 30‑footers.   You know (indiscernible) kind of killed us.   Now we got our scramble tomorrow, and that's a good format for us.   
We'll be ready to go.  
   
 Q.   When you're playing with Kenny and Sean and seeing them do well, is there a sense to try to press?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Not really.   There is so much golf tomorrow.   You can go out and get 14‑under par.   So you realize tomorrow is the day when (indiscernible).  
We are both driving it really well, so tomorrow going to be a lot fun.   Hitting a lot fairways and greens.   
   
 Q.   Brandt talks about low scores.   Is there a target?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   No, just need one more than the other guys.   Just got to go out and try to birdie every hole like Brandt said and tomorrow might be our day.
