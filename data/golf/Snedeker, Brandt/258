 Q.  Brandt, talk about your round today. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Got off to a good start.  Really good shots early in the round.  Burned a little edges.  Hit a kind of a mixed bag today, but all in all I hung in there and I made key putts when I needed to. 

 Q.  You performed well all week.  What were some of the keys to the entire week? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  I guess being in my home state, seeing a lot of friendly faces in the crowd.  I think I made every putt inside of ten feet.  When you do that you're going to play well.  If you don't, you need to find another job.  When you do that, it makes everything else kind of free up and makes you play a little bit easier and less stress. 

 Q.  Does this course, do you think it's a good set-up for the preparation for the Open next week? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Definitely.  You had to place your ball up there, where you wanted to miss it and it's just hard fairways to hit.  The ball was bouncing around, the wind blowing; a great test.  Pretty unbelievable. 

 Q.  Being so close to home do you feel like one of the home town guys? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  I hope so.  I don't get the credit of Vance Veazey and the other guys get.  I feel like coming home, it's always nice to get back to my home state and play golf. 

 Q.  Do you expect as far as like the winning score to be so low? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  I did.  Even though we got some rain on Friday afternoon, the course, the greens were so firm if you didn't hit the fairway you couldn't really hold the green.  They did such a great job setting up the golf course this week.  You're hitting a wedge and make birdie.  That's the way it should be.  I think Woody is playing great.  He's obviously a great driver of the golf ball.
