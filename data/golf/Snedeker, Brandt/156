 Q.   Good to have one under your belt, even though didn't turn out the way you wanted to; will you feel more relaxed tomorrow?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, Jim and I did a lot of really good stuff today.   We were up against a very tough pair and they were making a bunch of birdies on us, and we hung in there really tight.  
Got to 18 with a chance to win the match which is what you're trying do.   I just put an awful shot, put Jim in a terrible position.   Hate to do that to Jim, let alone my team, but the team can pick us up this afternoon and get us back in this thing, and I look forward to the next chance to go and put a point on the board.   
   
 Q.   What are you working on out here‑‑  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Same thing I've been working on.   Under pressure I get quick and stuff happens in my swing that I don't want to happen; and try to get a feel for the rest of the week so that if it does happen, I know I have something to go to to counteract it.   
   
 Q.   Do you do anything different in terms of the crowd?   Did you have to try to calm yourself down?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I was actually relatively calm.   Jim and I did a good job of staying in the moment and trying to give us the best chance possible to win points.   Jim played fantastic, and that's why you have veterans.   
   
 Q.   You didn't hit the first shot but were the first group out this morning, talk about how exciting that moment was?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was great.   The crowd was really amped up today.   We did our best to get them excited.   Got a slow start but got going on the back nine a little bit and any time you start doing that, good stuff can happen.  
   
 Q.   When is the last time you played foursomes matches?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I played the World Cup a couple years ago with Ben Curtis, so I kind of know what to expect.
