 Q.   Just talk about your win today.   You've seen Kyle recently?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   We've got some history going on.   He's a great guy.   I played really good today.   We just gave each other a few too many holes.  
I played pretty well.   I'm driving the ball great.   Just kind of hitting a fewer loose iron shots here and missing a few short shots.   If I get that tidied up for tomorrow I should be okay.  
   
 Q.   Have you looked at your match up for tomorrow?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I've got Peter Hanson.  
   
 Q.   Have you played against him?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, we played Memorial a couple of years ago.   A good guy.   A great ball‑striker.   Probably one of the best out here.   If he gets his putter working he's pretty tough to beat.   
So I know I've got my hands full tomorrow.   I've just got to go out there and hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens and put some pressure on him.  
   
 Q.   Going back to your win.   Are you happiest‑‑ you mentioned your driver?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   My ball‑striking has been better.   If anything, my strength, my putting, has been really mediocre this year.   I've not putted very well at all.   If I can get my putter going, just average, like it normally is, I should have a really good weekend.   It will be fun.
