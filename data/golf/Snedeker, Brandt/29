 Q.  What has this experience been like?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It's been unbelievable.  We've got 24 guys in that room giving everything they have.  This one is for Phil, it's for Davis, it's for all the past captains that have done so much to get us to where we are.   
This team came together.  I've never been part of anything like it in my life.  I'm so excited for the guys, so excited for U.S.A., everything this Cup embodies and I'm glad to be standing here.   
 Q.  This is going to be hard to top, isn't it?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It is.  I've got to pick my game up to top it.
