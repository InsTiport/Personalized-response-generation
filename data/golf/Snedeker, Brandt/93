Q.   Survived to advance, how do you break down what happened and how do you keep going?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I played a great stretch of golf in there and a bad stretch, and I've just got to eliminate the bad stretch. 
Did a good job of hitting quality shots on the last four or five holes, made some good putts, got some up and downs when I needed to.   You're going to have matches where you don't play good and you survive.   I did that today. 
Hopefully I can go out and have some fun tomorrow with Webby and make some birdie. 

Q.   How can a victory like today maybe jump start the confidence and get on a role here?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's always big when you're making big putts when you need to make them and hitting shots when you need to hit them.   You feel the nerves going, you know you can pull it off.   Always a positive thing.   You look at the right stuff and you get some positive reinforcements from that. 
Sometimes you just got to make it happen and figure it out, and I did a good job today of doing that.
