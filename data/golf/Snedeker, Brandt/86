 Tell me about your round today, goods and bads.BRANDT SNEDEKER: You know, I drove it will really well.  I gave myself opportunities early and hung in there pretty nicely.  I just could not hit the right club, it seemed like. I had a great shot on 9 that ended up in a really, really bad spot and made bogey there. Hit a great shot on 17, ended up going over the green. Hit a great shot on 15.  15 was just short, and seemed like every hole I was a half a club off. That's something to go work on for tomorrow and make sure I'm getting the right digits out there and making sure we're getting the right numbers and playing the right spots to the green.
Q. Pins today, difficult?BRANDT SNEDEKER: Very difficult, which is what we kind of expected, you know.  With the scores being where they were, I knew they were going to toughen them up this weekend.  But they did a great job making it fair.  With a few quality golf shots, you have birdie opportunities.  But you've got to make quality golf shots.  There's no way to fake a round.  Some guys shot low numbers, some guys shot 3- or 4-under par today.  It's out there, just hard to do it.
Q. When you finish a round like this and you're grinding and grinding, and you finish up and you're out of scoring, is that a relief?BRANDT SNEDEKER: It was a relief.  I didn't honestly have my best stuff on the back nine today where I just survived.  Made a bunch of pars coming in, which is what you have to do. You come out here fresh tomorrow, new mindset.  Seven shots is what I'm behind going into tomorrow.  That's nine holes out here.  I know a lot can happen.  I shot 30 on the front nine this week before, I can go do it again and put some pressure on them and have some fun tomorrow afternoon.
