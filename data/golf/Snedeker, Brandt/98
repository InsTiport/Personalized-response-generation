 Q.   That was a tense match, at least on the back nine.   Were you scoreboard watching at all and were you aware of the significance of what was going on and what it might mean?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's hard not to, big TV cameras everywhere, so it's hard not to look.   We understand how important every point is right now.   We got close, and Hunter played great down the stretch.   Really drove the ball awesome.   
   
 Q.   Everyone deals with rain delays, but do you think it's more difficult on rookies or visiting players, people who are chasing?   
HUNTER MAHAN:   If you're chasing it's nice to get a little break probably and reboot, and kind of find maybe some sort of swing thought or something that can kind of get you going.   These are long, tough days.   They are tough on everybody, and conserving your energy and making sure you use it wisely is extremely important.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Every time we thought we got some momentum going they would make a birdie putt on us or do something pretty spectacular.   It was nice to hang in there and hit some quality shots down the stretch and put the pressure back on them a little bit.  
   
 Q.   You came out especially strong after the delay; what are your thoughts on that?   
HUNTER MAHAN:   This is a pivotal match and a halve wasn't going to do us much good.   It was going to give some momentum back to them.   It was nice to get a full point; Tiger and Kuch kind of turned the table on those guys to go 4â€‘1 in the session would be unbelievable.
