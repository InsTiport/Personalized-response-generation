  BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was a bad day that turned out okay.   I played terrible this afternoon and this morning.   Making a putt like that gets the confidence going. 

Q.   How are you fine finding the Match Play?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I'm loving it.   There's a lot of excitement.   Winning a match, losing a match, and then having a chance in the weekend to do something pretty special, and hopefully be here late on Sunday.

Q.   And being reunited with your clubs? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I don't know what the deal is.   I think I might have to talk to them right now.   The other clubs won pretty easily‑‑ might get a place.   It's kind of a fluke.   I had a real tough day today.   I didn't play very well.   I can't blame the clubs, I wish I could, but it was all on me today.
