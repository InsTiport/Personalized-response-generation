 Q.   67 is going to be a very good score.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, excited about it.   I put a lot of hard work in this week and felt like stuff was going in the right direction.   Today everything kind of clicked.   I rolled the ball great, hit a lot of quality iron shots and gave myself a lot of looks at birdie.  
   
 Q.   You rolled the ball really well, 25 putts in this third round.   Contrast that with 31 in the opening round.   A mechanical adjustment?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   A setup adjustment.   I was kind of lining the ball a little bit too much off the heel and kind of moving it more out towards the toe of the putter.   It feels like the toe meets more in the center and the ball is coming off a lot faster, rolling a lot better and hugging the line a lot better.   Able to hit some quality putts day in and day out now.  
   
 Q.   You're going to be back in this tournament I have a feeling coming into Sunday.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, you know, I'm going to have to shoot something else like that tomorrow.   Hopefully some windy conditions again and maybe post something early tomorrow, have those guys kind of falter a little bit.   Jordan and Martin are both playing fantastic.   I'm going to need a lot to help to get back in this thing.   I did what I could today, played a great round of golf, probably need to do something a little better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You should take a lot of confidence into Sunday.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I will.   It should be fun.
