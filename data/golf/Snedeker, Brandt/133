 Q.   Just talk about your round today?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I played really, really solid teed to green.   Made a few putts early to get the momentum going but tough to make a lot of putts over here today.   Golf course is in great shape.   Greens are a little bumpy but rolled really fast and hard to make a lot of putts on.   
All in all it's good start to the week.   Got two more days, don't know where you stand so tough Saturday afternoon, so good start.  
   
 Q.   Playing with Luke obviously.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, it was nice, and to be Toby's son caddying for him.   We are thick as thieves‑‑ when we get together, we like to have a good time and it's worked out well that we can play together.   We had a lot of fun out there today.  
   
 Q.   Is it a nice change of pace after a couple under coming in this week?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, a lot more fun out there today, just because of who we were playing with, had a great time with them and made the day a lot more enjoyable.
