 Q.   Brandt and Jim, it was a little more fun playing 18 today than 24 hours ago.   
JIM FURYK:   It was, but we also had a 1‑up lead coming here.   We got it back to even yesterday, and those guys scrapped hard and the birdie at 16 was incredible and they almost made birdie at 17.   I feel fortunate, but we played well, and I'm proud of my partner here.   He played like a champ.   If there's anyone on the team now that I want standing over a five‑footer that I just ran by the hole or left short, I want this guy over that five‑footer, I promise you.   
   
 Q.   Brandt, you putted beautifully.   You have posted your first victory in Ryder Cup competition.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I got the monkey off my back.   Yesterday was kind of hard to take, to give away that half a point on 18 the way I drove it, but when you've got a player like Jim, you're never out of it.   Jim played great coming down the stretch yesterday, he played great again today.   I can't tell you how much pressure on those shots coming down the stretch were, and he just flagged it right every time.   It's fun to have a partner like that behind you.
