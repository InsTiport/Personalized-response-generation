  BRANDT SNEDEKER:   You all know as much as I do.   I played good today, just got off to a slow start, and that kind of hurt me.   But it's in Davis' hands.   He's got a tough decision ahead of him.   Somebody is going to be really disappointed tomorrow, and whoever it is probably deserved to make the team.   So it's going to be a tough night for me and everybody else on the outside looking in.

Q.   What kind of expectations did you have for this event?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I'm playing well, so I had high expectations.   I played a bad first round, and the second round kind of killed me a little bit.   But I had a great weekend, which is very positive, leading into next week, playing good golf, so if I can just keep it going for next week, I like my chances.

Q.   With so many guys in the mix for the four spots, how disappointing will it be if you don't get called?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   As disappointing as it would be, at the end of the day, it lies on you.   I had two years to qualify, or the PGA.   I played bad at the PGA.   Anybody that's got a problem with that needs to reevaluate their goals the last two years.   It's a tough goal to be upset, but that's the way it works out.   I've been on the outside quite a few years, so I kind of know what to expect, and if I'm lucky enough to get on, I'll be excited.

Q.   How much was it weighing on you?   You had to be thinking about it. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was a lot.   I turned my phone off.   Just got tired of hearing about it.   I did a pretty good job of staying in the tournament and not thinking about it.   I was obviously really nervous today on the golf course.   Today was a very big day.   If I played bad today it might sway him one way or the other, so just tried to play as well as I could.
