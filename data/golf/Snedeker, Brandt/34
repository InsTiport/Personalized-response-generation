 Q.  I know how much you love to play in the Ryder Cup.  How difficult was it to wait in the morning and then finally get out here in the afternoon?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It was tough.  We were up watching everything going on this morning.  I knew my everybody has got their role and job on this team.  My job today was to come out and make putts, and just let Brooks do what he does.  Brooks played fantastic.  It was an awesome win for us today.  We needed it and we're going to build on this thing going forward.   
 Q.  How would you compare your first ever Ryder Cup experience this afternoon to anything else you have ever done in this game?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's nothing like anything else.  That first tee shot was unbelievable.  Going there in the morning watching those guys was fun.  But there's nothing like the Ryder Cup.
