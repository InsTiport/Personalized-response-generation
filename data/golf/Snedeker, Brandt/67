  BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Got off to a slow start.   Played a great back-9.   Played pretty well coming in.   Started a little too far back today.   I didn't have a great front-9 and has behind the 8 ball a little bit. 
Putted great last 9 holes and made some birdies and ended up with a good finish this week but disappointing because I played so bad the 1st Round, put myself out of the tournament.

Q.   When you get such a bad 1st Round, is it forget about it, move on?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I've won from 5, 6, 7 behind before.   There's always a chance.   I need to have a really good front-9 today.   I didn't do that.   I shot 1-under par.   I didn't shoot 3, 4-under par. 
In fact, that 9 is getable.   Make some birdies on the back-9.   Didn't do that.   Still good finish and good week.   Considering the weather we've had to deal with this week, getting in 72 holes is pretty impressive.   People here at the Byron Nelson did a great job of taking care of us, making sure we get done on time.

Q.   What happened on 17?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Hit the wrong club off the tee and missed a short putt.   Long two-putt.   Missed a 3, 4-footer.   Disappointing because I played pretty well.   Hate to miss a short one like that.
