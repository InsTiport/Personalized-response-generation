  BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Feels great to finish one.   The last two weeks, playing great but running into two Hall of Fames really motivated me to go out that I can play good and handle the lead.   I love being in this position and today was a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   What really has been the key?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I'm just not making too many mistakes, I'm playing smart golf and I'm not putting myself in too many bad positions, and make a key putt here or there to get the round going.   It's been a lot of fun to play golf like this and the way I know that I can.   
   
 Q.   You were out yesterday and today at Pebble Beach with your partner, Toby, and I noticed that you were really spending time with him out there, I know you know one another, but I think that shows an awful lot about you that you're not so much worried about trying to win this golf tournament.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   You think about how many times he's going to have to play in the last group in the Pebble Beach Pro‑Am, such a unique experience and such a cool things to be inside the ropes on a Sunday and also have your tournament‑‑ and to win that as a partnership this year with a close friend is something we'll remember for the rest of our lives.  
   
 Q.   Did that help you today?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It did.   He's a very calming influence out there today.   He didn't help me one shot but he did a lot of cheering today and kept me very calm.
