Q. Talking about your round today.
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Couldn't have scripted a better start, birdieing three of the first four.  Kind of a short iron into the par 5, made par there and then did what I've been doing all week, make a mistake and made a double bogey on 7 and bad swing like all week.
I'm making enough birdies to be right there.  I'm making mistakes you can't make.  I'm going to need a perfect round tomorrow.  Don't make any mistakes and don't keep making the dumb decisions like I've been doing.  My putting is there, the rest of the game is there.  If I can think well for 18 holes I'll have a chance.
Q. Talk about what you're going to have to do tomorrow.
BRANDT SNEDEKER: You have to shoot a flawless round.  Those guys up there aren't going anywhere.  I'm so far behind I'm going to have to shoot a 7, 8, 9-under par round and make sure I don't make any bogies and the birdies are going to be there.  The greens are perfect.  The course is playing short, the fairways are running so much.  You're going to have a lot of wedges in your hand.  Need to be aggressive and 3, 4-under par is going to do me no good.  I know what I need to do.  I need to go low.
