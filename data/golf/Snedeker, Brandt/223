   BRANDT SNEDEKER: Ben played very good today and I didn't give him much help. It was a tough day for us. We had a chance and we still have a chance tomorrow. We just have to play an exceptional round of golf and kind of hope for some help.   
 Ben played very good and I just didn't do much out there today. I didn't have my game and couldn't put it in play and Ben was kind of fighting an uphill battle today.   
 BEN CURTIS: We played the par 5s better than yesterday, that's for sure, but still wasn't that great. Obviously a little disappointed, but you know, I missed some chances.   
 You never know what happens tomorrow. You know, we go out and do what Spain did yesterday, who knows, we might win the thing.
