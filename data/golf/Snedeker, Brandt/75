 Q.   Just some thoughts about being the 400th winner from the WEB.COM?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, we're so fortunate to have the WEB.COM TOUR because every opportunity gives guys like me to go out there and learn our craft and learn how to be professional golfers.   
And all these wins that I've had, my seventh win on TOUR is because, to win twice out there, getting confidence to know that I can do it under pressure against guys who have been on TOUR or are getting ready to be on TOUR.  
And I firmly believe I would not be the golfer I am without those two years I spent on the WEB.COM TOUR.   I learned a lot.   Every guy out there should cherish those events because they teach you how to be a pro.   That's something you don't really know how to do when you first turn pro.  
   
 Q.   I know it's been awhile since you've been out there, but do you have like one key memory that sticks out?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I have a bunch of memories.   I made some of my closest friends in life from traveling that TOUR.   Being in guys' cars, driving 12 hours to each event.   Going out to the same dinner restaurants every night.   So it was a really special time and it was awesome.
