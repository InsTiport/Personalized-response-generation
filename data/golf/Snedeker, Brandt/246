 Q.  Another great round today.  18 obviously not the ideal finish.  Just a couple comments. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  I played really good.  I missed a short putt I think on 11, and it wasn't the same after that.  I didn't make any putts coming in, which is very unlike me.  I'm normally a very aggressive putter and just couldn't seem to get comfortable on those last eight holes.  Hopefully we'll get it squared away on the putting green and get ready for the weekend. 

 Q.  Talk about the driver situation. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  It's better.  Obviously it's not ideal.  I don't quite have the control of that one or the length with that one that I would like, but Keith from TaylorMade met me out here yesterday afternoon and we hit ten different drivers and they've been great, and we found one that works, so I can't complain about the driver.  I drove it pretty good all day today. 

 Q.  Just got to keep the same game plan for tomorrow? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Make a bunch of birdies.  Scores are obviously getting lower and lower each day, so we want to get out there and make as many as we can and try and make up all the ones I missed today. 

 Q.  What was going on today as far as the scoring? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  The course played obviously a lot softer today, but the wind was not as strong today as it was yesterday.  I think it might be a one or two-club wind today whereas yesterday it was three and four-club winds out there.  The course played a little bit wider and they had some very scorable pins out there today, so that's a good combo. 

 Q.  Being a first-timer here, is there any secret to how well you're doing? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  No secret at all.  I guess I haven't played here long enough to know where not to hit it.  I just keep my head down and keep trying to rip them and find out where they're going, and it's worked out well so far.
