 Q.  From the bunker you stuck it,  out posing and stuff.  When it ends up over the green, you're like what the -- 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Wasn't too thrilled.  I ended up getting up and down, saving the round.  Made a bunch of good putts.  Made a lot of putts.  I didn't make that many the first two days.  I'll save them for today and tomorrow. 

 Q.  I was going to say, you're going to have to make a few tomorrow.  Good thing you were playing with Jeff Maggert.  I know he didn't finish all that strong but really got it going during the middle of the round. 
 It seemed to inspired you. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  We started feeding off each other.  He had a double on 2, reeled off five, six birdies in a row.  Made some birdies.  Really, great group.  Chad was fun.  We had a lot of fun out there.  Kind of helped each other play well. 

 Q.  Seeing how low these guys are going out there on the golf course, what do you feel like you're going to have to do tomorrow to keep yourself in contention? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Improve on today.  I'm going to have to shoot at least lower than I did today, maybe two, three to have a chance.  I don't know how many behind I am right now but it's going -- three, four by the end of the day at least and, you know, it's a good thing. 
 At least you know you've got to go out there and shoot something low tomorrow.  There's no holding back.  Shoot at every pin, have fun. 

 Q.  Keep doing that.  Have fun out there.  Well played today. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Thank you.
