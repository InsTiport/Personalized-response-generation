Q.   You got off to a great start, a little sideways; walk us through that part. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was tougher, you get off to that kind of start, get right back in the middle of the tournament and made a 3‑putt, dumb 3‑putt on 7. 
8, I didn't hit a bad shot but hit a great flop shot and lipped one out and 9 was the killer to get right in front of the green in two and make bogey‑‑ it's rustiness, got to blame it on something; just not playing enough and chipping enough around the greens. 
That's something I'm going to work on next week, get ready for Palm Springs.   And all in all it was a great week.   Got back in contention, which was nice, but I have some stuff I need to work on for sure.

Q.   On 7 you were aggressive with that putt and still trying to make birdies but it just didn't work out. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I knew I needed to make a bunch today.   It was like Dustin was at 15‑‑ that's 10‑under par for me to have a chance, and I knew that.   And I got off to a great start and just couldn't keep the momentum going, and it was that week for me.   I missed some short putts every day and couldn't get the momentum going the way I wanted to.   It happens when you're a little rusty.
So I'll work on it and get ready for Humana.   Looking forward to getting out there. 

Q.   Did you have any idea what was going on? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   No, no clue.   I knew I needed to do something special, and I knew I needed to make a bunch of birdies.   I never look at score boards, anyway.   So that was actually easier on me that way I can keep my head down and not look at score boards.   Man, it was close, but wasn't quite there.
