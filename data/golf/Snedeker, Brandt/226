 Q. I guess we start out, the good news is there's still two more days to play.
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Very frustrating the first few days. Thought I played pretty well. Hit a lot of quality shots. I need to keep the round going, get up and down. That's golf. 
 Still got a lot -- I think I was in the same position last year on the weekend so I have to put two really good rounds together and hope I get some help.

 Q. How about the course today?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Definitely played gettable. The greens were a little beat up this afternoon so it was hard to make some putts. Get the ball in play and really have a lot of short irons to these greens. The greens are soft. Couldn't convert on any of those.

 Q. You want to check to see what Pettersson is eating?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: He's playing great. I guess Greensboro is really good for him. This is like his retirement fund. He plays good here every year. I was able to squeak one out past him last year. He's playing like he is, I don't think anybody is going to be able to beat him this week.

 Q. Last question, how are you feeling?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Feel good. I'm very frustrated. I feel good about my game. I'm hitting it great. I can't seem to get everything going at the right time. 
 Last week I hit it bad and putted it pretty good and chipped it pretty good. This week I'm hitting it better and putting and chipping bad. That's just the way golf is. Hopefully it will be better on the weekend.
