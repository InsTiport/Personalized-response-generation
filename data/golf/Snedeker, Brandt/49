BRANDT SNEDEKER: Just frustrated I didn't finish off.  I was playing really, really good.  Made some mistakes coming down the stretch.  Didn't make any putts today at all.  That being said, tomorrow is a new day.  Got to go out there and get through this.  Hopefully I missed all the putts today, saved them all for tomorrow.
Q. You knew coming into this you'd have to play well to advance?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: I'm playing well and I'm excited about tomorrow.  Obviously Charl is playing well.  He's 2-0 in our group.  Be fun to go head to head tomorrow.  Whoever wins tomorrow gets to go through, so it will be a good match.
