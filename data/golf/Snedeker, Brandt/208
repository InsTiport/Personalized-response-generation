  Q. Hey, Brandt, I know you're tired. It's been a long week. I got there at 15 but I guess I wasn't in time there.  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah. I guess I played really good again today. Just frustrating to hit it good all day and not make any putts. Eagle putt on 15 didn't go in. Miss a little 2-footer. All in all, a good week.   
 I played really, really we'll tee to green. Very encouraging. My putter left me. We'll get it figured out. Hopefully next week I can kind of improve and make some birdies.  
  
  Q. Means the putter is going to be strong for five or six days in row.  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I'm overdue. I never say that. I always make my fair share. It's hard to play that good and really never -- I didn't get any trouble until 18 and not to be able to make enough birdies and miss all the putts.  
  
  Q. That was a valiant effort at 18 to try the hit that on the green. That was some work.  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I didn't have a choice. At that point I needed to make birdie. Sitting around here and waiting, what are you going to do?  
  
  Q. Good playing this week. We appreciate it. The best of luck next week.  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Thanks a lot.
