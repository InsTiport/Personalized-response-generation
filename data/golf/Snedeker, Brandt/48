Q. You turned some of that frustration into birdies today?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, it was great.  That's exactly what I needed today.  Got down early which kind of fired me up.  Made some great birdies here on the back nine, turning 1-up.  I said I'm going to finish this match up.  Be aggressive, make some birdies.  Don't sit around and wait and let Charl hang around.  Did a great job of doing that.
Obviously got done early today and look forward to the match tomorrow.
Q. You have got to carry some confidence into the weekend?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Looking forward to it.  Jason is obviously playing great.  We've got him tomorrow, it looks like.  Looking forward to making him work tomorrow.  We're going to have some fun.  Make some more putts on him tomorrow and go out there and try to get this thing done.
