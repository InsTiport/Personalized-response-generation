Q. Not the end of the day you were looking for.  What kept you from winning the trophy again here?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Lots of things.  A couple of things, very disappointing.  Put myself in a position to win a golf tournament and to play the way I did today is disheartening to say the least.  To putt the way I did and make decisions the way I did, put the ball in play off the tee like I did today and have every chance to be successful and completely gave it away.
It's going to be a tough night, very frustrating to say the least.  Lots of positives to build on for next week, and hopefully by tomorrow get my mind right and get ready to go for next week.
Q. What is the biggest thing that you think you can bring to Baltusrol that you think will allow you to contend?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: I drove the ball fantastic today, I real will I did.  I put myself in position on just about every hole.  You do that next week, you have half the battle won.  I'm excited about that.  I'm excited about the fact that heading into a major, hit some pretty solid shots all the way around.
Putter let me down today.   Didn't think well around the golf course.  That can come back to bite you in situations like this.  It's very frustrating but can build on it for next week and hope to use this as momentum.
