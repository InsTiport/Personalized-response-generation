  STEVE TODD:   5 & 4 winner over Thomas BjÃ¶rn.   Good start.
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I was, got pretty fortunate, Thomas bogeyed the first three holes and made my job a lot easier today.   Got off to a good start and then kept the pressure on.   I played really well.   Didn't put the ball in too many bad positions and even when I did, I got it up‑and‑down.
And I made key putts for birdie that got the momentum going my way.   Overall it was a great day, considering I started the day with ten clubs in the bag.   My bags arrived about the fourth hole, I got rest of the clubs I thought I might need and was able to survive after that. 
STEVE TODD:   If you could just take us through‑‑
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I had my clubs‑‑ they just came in today.   And I had a makeshift set, some irons that were not quite right but they were close.   And then I grabbed Johnson, his backup driver this morning.   I knew my clubs were not going to make it and actually worked really well, so I think it's my driver well and no longer his. 
And then grabbed a putter from the pro shop and a 3‑wood and hybrid and lob‑wedge, and my putter came in about the fourth hole, and actually putted with the putter from the pro shop, because I started off pretty well, made some key putts and my putter nevercame out of the bag today.   So kind of a weird day to say the least. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   They haven't charged me yet, so I'm sure it will be on, I'm sure it will be a hundred bucks; it will be well worth it. 

Q.   Your chances, only ten clubs‑‑
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Didn't like them.   Didn't have them.   Didn't like my chances at all actually.   I knew Thomas was a world‑class player and world‑class ball‑striker and I knew it was pretty windy, so I knew it kind of favoured him. 
Got very fortunate to get off to the start I did to give me some confidence.   I had to use that as an edge, I guess.   Go out there and see if I could try to beat him, try to do what I could with what I was playing with.   I guess what I was playing with wasn't as bad as I thought it was, because it worked pretty well today.

Q.   Have you ever played practise rounds with a shortened bag? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   A little bit.   It's funny, I'll take three or four clubs, hit driver, 7‑iron, whatever, just to mess around and try different shots and get a feel for what the ball is doing. 
I said to my caddie this morning, before we went out, I feel like we are playing in a club tournament, playing five or six clubs.   I only driver and 3‑iron to start off the day, my second‑highest club was 3‑iron.   It was definitely a weird bag going out.

Q.   But when you do that, do you find you concentrate harder on making up shots with those clubs?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I think you also give yourself a lot more leeway to hit poor shots.   You're not as uptight.   You realise you're going to have some weird numbers and weird clubs and you're going to have to make do and try to hit some funky shots you're not used to hitting and have some fun with it, and I did that today.

Q.   Given you are only allowed to take three clubs out of your own bag when they arrived ‑‑ four ‑‑ what clubs did you ‑‑
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I grabbed my 3‑wood, my hybrid and my lob‑wedge and my putter. 

Q.   So which putter are you going to use tomorrow?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I'm going to putt with both of them to make sure‑‑ I don't know, right now I think it would be pretty hard to take out the putter I had today.   I had seven or eight 1‑putts.   Pretty hard to mess with what works. 
Still, my putter has been in the bag for six years.   It would be hard to take them out after one decent day with a different putter.

Q.   So what did you do with two putters‑‑
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I took my 7‑iron out.

Q.   And did you calculate that over the opening holes how late they would come?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   We thought, there's no par 3s today where 7‑iron might be needed.   Maybe one or two holes all day, depending how the wind was blowing.   I got lucky, I only really needed it once today, andwas able to hit the green for the 25‑footer for the one time I did need a 7‑iron.   So the long par 4 on front nine‑‑ 7 maybe.   I had 185, 7‑iron, 6‑iron, cut it in there made 25‑footer for birdie, so worked out okay.

Q.   What made you come to this tournament particularly?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's funny, I've watched the tournament every year played for the past five years on the Golf Channel and always had an affinity to play in this tournament, just because I love match play.   I love the one‑on‑one aspect of it, and this has such a great list of champions going back to Seve and Ernie winning as many times as he did.   Obviously even with last year; the field y'all had last year was phenomenal, and this year is just as good.   So it's a great time to come over and play against the world's best and see what you've got. 

Q.   The champions, you named just a few there, there's a great American tradition, too, with Palmer, Jack and Corey Pavin; does that make you think, wow, I could be the next one?   And Mark O'Meara was the last one?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I remember watching Mark beat Tiger a couple years ago.   I think this would be a very special event for me to win just because of the match‑play aspect and the field that's here.   You're playing against the world's best, and to have a chance to do that is always something you try to get your game up and ready to go for. 
It would be cool.   I've never had an international victory.   It's something I want to do before my career is over with, and I would love to play in this one as long as they let me play in it; as many years as I can come‑‑ stay up in the top of the World Rankings.   I would love to come back.

Q.   Did you see it as definite Ryder Cup benefits, not just points but playing match play? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, it would be pretty tough if I were to win this week for Davis to find an excuse to leave me off the team.   Playing in a world match‑play event like this, and after keep playing the way I'm playing after this, if I keep playing well, I think it would be a pretty good bonus to come over and win a match‑play tournament against a bunch of European guys and the world's best.   Can't do anything but help. 
STEVE TODD:   Thank you.
