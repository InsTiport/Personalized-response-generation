Q.   Obviously a tough day.   Talk a little bit about the match. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Peter played great.   He really did.   He made a bunch of birdies.   I had my chances.   A couple of times he three‑putted and I didn't take advantage of it and missed a bunch of putts.   I hit it pretty well.   You have to make 8‑, 10‑footers around here.

Q.   You win 8, 9 and 10 to get the match back to 1‑down.   Did you feel good about that?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I felt good.   I had a good chance on 11, I didn't get it up and down.   Didn't birdie 11 or 13 from the middle of the fairway, easy up and down.   So that kind of lost the match right there.   I had a bunch of good looks, just didn't make putts.   You have to make putts to win in match play.
