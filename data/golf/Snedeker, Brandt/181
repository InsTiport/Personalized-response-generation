 Q.   Talk about the match.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was crazy.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the battle.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It was a battle.   I played really well early and missed a few putts and kind of kept Retief in the ball game.   He won three straight holes on me and I was down.   It some poor iron shots coming in and was able to save some pars.  
I was 1‑down on the 18 tee and I knew it had to be a birdie and did to extend it.   I made some good clutch putts on 1, 2, and 3, and then the par on 3 was kind of a gift from Retief.   First really kind of bad swing he made in a while.   
   
 Q.   Let's go through 18.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   18, he hit 3‑wood and laid back.   I had driver and took over the bunker and had 115 in.   I hit a sand wedge to about six feet.   He hit it right, chipped it up about eight feet, so I got to see the line on the putt.   He missed it and I made it.   
   
 Q.   There's a fine line in this tournament in maybe going on Wednesday and then ‑‑  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, there is.  
   
 Q.   It's kind of good to get over the hump on this side of it?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It is.   You know you are going to have close matches.   There is just no way if you are going to be here for all six of them.   So to get a close one under my belt and know that I was able to get the shots when I needed to gives me confidence going into tomorrow.   
I know I'm playing good, I just had kind of a bad 3‑ or 4‑hole stretch.   Looking forward to going out there tomorrow and shooting something low.
