 Q.   Talk about playing with Jim tomorrow?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, really excited.   Jim is playing great, a great guy to lean on, he's got so much experience.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your game fitting foursomes?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's great, Jim is a straight down the middle kind of guy, been playing really, really well and obviously driving it pretty straight and a lot of quality iron shots.   Look for us to go out there and have a lot of fun out there and I think we'll do really well and I think we'll team up perfectly for each other.  
   
 Q.   Did you guys practice on the course?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   We did, we practiced the last two days doing that.   We got a good idea of our strategy, what we are going to do on every hole, get an idea of how we are going to read putts and help each other.   Just looking forward to getting out there and having a lot of fun tomorrow.  
It will be a tough match, they are two of the best players in the world, they have a close relationship and they are going to come out swinging the first match of the day.   I think my game stacks up against anybody's right now and I think Jim's does, too, so we are going to give them a hard match tomorrow and try to get that win.
