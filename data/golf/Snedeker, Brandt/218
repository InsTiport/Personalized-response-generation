 Q. How are you feeling?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I feel okay right now. Good golf makes you feel better so we'll get an IV in me and I'll see how it is this afternoon.

 Q. How are you able to fight all that?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: That's a good thing, not worry about the outcome, worry about standing upright. I made a couple birdies this morning coming in which was great. I really played a solid round of golf.

 Q. Do you feel like you're strong enough to contend?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Definitely. I'm playing great, been playing great for six, eight weeks. I'm putting fantastic and keep the ball in the fairway, I like my chances.

 Q. What about the third round, especially this morning?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I played -- hit a lot of quality golf shots. I made a few putts here and there but really didn't get the ball out of position hardly at all until 18, the only bogey I had all day. 
 When you drive in the fairway on this golf course and as soft as it is, you're going to have a lot of birdie opportunities. Hopefully I can do that again in the fourth round.
