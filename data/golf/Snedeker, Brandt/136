 Q.   Thoughts about the day?   You're still in it obviously.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, a lot of golf left.   Made double bogey today on 12, which was a little disheartening because I was playing pretty well.   Birdieing the last hole was nice because it leaves a good taste in my mouth going into the weekend.   Phil is playing great golf right now, and if you want to catch him, you have to shoot something low.  
   
 Q.   You've been in a lot of these where you have to make a lot of birdies to keep pace.   What's the mindset on that?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Well, first and foremost, you have to play from the fairway here.   If you're not going to play from the fairway you're not going to have many birdies.   You've got to play the parâ€‘5s real, especially on the back nine.   13 and 15 are pivotal holes, along with 17, so those are holes you've got to circle in the morning and make sure you birdie those.   Those are the ones that kind of keep your round going.
