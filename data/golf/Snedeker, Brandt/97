Q.   Probably five, six, seven eight guys are all going to have a chance tomorrow, elite players, most Top‑50 in the world, because of that, does it change your strategy tomorrow, be a little more aggressive because a low number is going to happen? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Tomorrow you're going to have be to aggressive, give yourself a chance on the front nine, shoot 3‑ or 4‑under par.   There's so many elite players tomorrow; it's not going to come backwards; it's only going to go forwards.   I left a lot out there and feel like my low round is yet to come this week so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   The wind is unpredictable, how is this golf course suited for a final day?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's going to be a lot of fun, should be a lot of birdies.   The pin positions are going to be in positions tomorrow where we can be aggressive.   The greens are rolling perfect.   There's going to be a low number.   Somebody is going to shoot 7‑under par. 
So knowing that going into your round, you need to make sure you play aggressively when you have the chance and pick your spots, and the par 5s are going to decide who wins or lose. Whoever plays the par 5s tomorrow is probably going to have a good chance of winning.
