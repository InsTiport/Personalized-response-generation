 Q.   Third good day for you.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, playing good. I'll take another one just like it.   I played really solid tee‑to‑green.   Didn't make the putts I needed to make to go low, but all in all, it was a good day.   
   
 Q.   Looks like you'll have a couple‑shot lead before you get to the final round.   Maybe just talk about this stretch you've been on the last three or four weeks.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's been good, hopefully it's prepared me to handle tomorrow really well.   I've been in the mix the last couple weeks, and I know ‑‑ what it feels like this early in the year to have that kind of experience, but it's nice.   There's going to be a lot of great players around me, have a chance.   Pebble can yield a low score if you're playing well.   So no lead is safe around here, especially with the closing holes.   So need to go out and play a really solid round of golf tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the fact that you played Pebble today?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I do.   I know exactly how the greens are rolling right now and I know how much the balls, the chips are rolling out versus saying soft.   The course is playing great.   
So I feel comfortable rolling the ball, and not a whole lot of dramatic changes between the green speeds and stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   And health‑wise, you're okay?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Health‑wise I'm good.   I've got some sore stuff in my body but that just happens; (if you play) five out of six weeks, you're going to be sore so looking forward to next week off.   
   
 Q.   So more or less just maintenance?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Maintenance, yeah.
