 Q.   Last year you were 7 strokes back and you won the tournament.   What do you feel this year?   
    BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I've got to make some more birdies.   I've got a long way to go.   I've got a guy at the top of the leaderboard that doesn't like giving up leads, so I have to go catch him.   
    I did a great job today of staying patient and playing good golf.   Just need to go out there tomorrow morning and finish with three or four birdies.  
   
 Q.   I noticed you were standing over your birdie putt and the horn blew.   
    BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, luckily, the greens are really bumpy right now, so I'm kind of glad they blew when they did, so fresh greens in the morning and have a good look at birdie to start the day.  
   
 Q.   Could you have putt out if you wanted to?   
    BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I could have, but the greens are bumpy right now.  
   
 Q.   And you're happy with you are your game today?  
    BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I was 7â€‘back to start the day, and I had an outside chance, not a great chance, but an outside chance of winning a golf tournament.   That's a great start of the day.  
   
 Q.   You had a lot of golf today, but you were playing well at the end.   
    BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, exactly.   We'll build on that for tomorrow.
