  BRANDT SNEDEKER: I obviously didn't putt well.  I played well -- excited about the way I played the last few days.  I know the scores don't dictate that I'm playing that well, but I am.  It's just unfortunate that I had two bad days of putting at the same time.  That's tough. I'll go back home and try to recap the year, see what -- no fun being my last event.  But I'll be ready to go whenever my next start is going to be.   Q.  What do you feel your chances are with Tom?  BRANDT SNEDEKER: Certainly didn't help my cause the last two days.  I don't know.  I know I'm playing good.  I know if my name is called I'm up to it.  I didn't do anything the last week or two weeks to justify or to solidify a spot on the team.  I couldn't really tell you.   Q.  If you had to sit down and sell Tom on why you should be on the team, what would you say about yourself?  BRANDT SNEDEKER: I think Tom -- I know I'm playing well, I know I'm doing the right stuff.  I didn't come through the last two weeks, which is frustrating on my part.  You but I'm not -- I could easily have shot 63 when I teed it up this morning.  I think he realizes golf is what it is.  Sometimes you don't get out of what you put into it.  And hopefully he sees that part of it. There's other guys playing great.  So it would be really hard for me to sit here and make my case when other guys at the top of the leaderboard have a chance to win this week.   Q.  Is it going to be difficult to wait the next few days?  BRANDT SNEDEKER: No.  I'll go home and have fun watching the guys up on the top of the leaderboard try to win.  It's not going to be hard.  I'm not going to adjust my schedule or do anything, wait by the phone or anything like that.  I've got two kids at home waiting to see me, so I'll be okay.
