 Q. Great performance out there, very difficult to score today. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, it was a tough day. Trevor played fantastic. I obviously couldn't get anything going, couldn't make any putts when I needed to. I'm still a little emotional, as you can tell, but it's one of those things; you've got of kind of pick yourself up, realize what you did wrong and go fix it.

 Q. Just now you had to take a couple of moments. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, probably still need a few more.

 Q. We don't know what that is like. What is it like?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: (Crying into towel.) That says it all. Sorry.
