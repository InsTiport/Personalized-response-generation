  Q. Two back behind the leader heading into the final round. Just some comments on the round today and how you're feeling as you make your way tomorrow.  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: If I have a good day at ball striking, which I can do, which I feel I can do -- I haven't struck it that great yet -- I like my chances tomorrow.   
 My short game is in excellent shape. Saving a lot of shots, getting up and down and making putts. Going to be a tough day tomorrow. So, looking forward to it. Should be a fun battle.  
  
  Q. Good and the bad about today?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: My ball striking was a little bit off today. I didn't have a lot of chances for birdie. That being said, didn't do myself any damage today. I was able to turn what could be a bad round into a decent round and go tomorrow and try to do well.
