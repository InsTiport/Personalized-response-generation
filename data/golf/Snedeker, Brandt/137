 Q.   Brandt, 7‑under par 64, just keep it rolling, right, just wake up and stay out of the way?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Obviously needed to go a little lower.   I'm only 4 behind after that.   It was fun out there.   We had a great group of guys, me and Padraig and Hunter had a great time out there today and kind of fed off each other, got off to a hot start and played pretty well.   A couple loose shots here and there, but all in all, take that start for sure.  
   
 Q.   I hate asking a guy about something that's going on in front of you because you did play a great round of golf, but what was it like hearing all those roars out in front?   Were you feeding off that?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, it was fun.   It gave us a target to go after.   Seeing Phil make all those birdies was‑‑ we're all fans of golf, we're all fans of Phil, so we wanted to see him make that putt on the last hole.   We were listening for the roar on 8 green and didn't hear it go in, which was a shame.   I heard he put a good roll on it, it just didn't go in.   It was a lot of fun watching the leaderboards all day and watching him go as low as he was.   
   
 Q.   Fred's call was unbelievable, it was painful hearing that lip‑out.   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, it sounded painful back there on 8 green, but we wish we would have been playing a little faster so we could have seen it up close and personal.   But it was a lot of fun.   Phil has been out here for a long time, and for him to shoot a score like that and have a chance at 59 had to be a lot of fun for him.   We know he was trying to shoot 58, not 59, so I'm sure he's a little disappointed.   He played great.
