 Q.   Jim, did you have a sense of what was going on ahead of you while you were going through your match back there?   
JIM FURYK:   For the most part.   I kind of had Bubba and Webb, what they were doing.   I know Phil and Keegan were playing great, and I had a hard time following the match in front of us, figuring it out, but I knew we were doing well.   
   
 Q.   Brandt, talk about the pressure of playing in your first Ryder Cup and going through foursomes, which is the most difficult format?   
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's really tough.   It's hard to get rhythm, but when you've got a guy like Jim hitting every shot the way you're supposed to coming down the stretch, the way he played on 15 through 18 was just phenomenal.   It makes my job a lot easier.   My job is not to mess it up at that point.   I did my best to try to do that on 18, but he bailed me out and played great.
