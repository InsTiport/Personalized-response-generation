 Q. 12-under. Your thought on your day today.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Struggled off the tee. I didn't really give myself a whole lot of good opportunities out there. Kind of scraped it around, survived. I didn't birdie either par-5 which will probably come back to haunt me if I don't win this thing tomorrow.   
Got a chance going into tomorrow. Go out there and shoot something low. Bunch of guys around with a chance to win. Somebody will shoot 63, 64 tomorrow and win this thing.  
   
 Q. 16 of 18 greens the last two days. That's pretty strong.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It is for me. I'm not hitting it perfect. I'm able to get on the greens and gives yourself opportunities. Unfortunately when you're not in the fairways you can't give yourself a bunch of uphill putts. The downhill putts are so fast. I left myself a lot of difficult birdie putts today. 18 was a good look. I'm going to go work on it a little bit and be ready to go tomorrow.  
   
 Q. Looks like 15 is the lead right now. This could be another shoot-out on Sunday.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It typically is here. Somebody comes from back in the pack and shoots a low one and has a chance to win. Hopefully that's me tomorrow. Shoot 62, 63, post and watch.  
   
 Q. Thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Thank you.
