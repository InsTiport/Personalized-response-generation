Q.   Sneds, let's talk about the good stuff.   You were swinging at it well. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I hit a lot of quality shots today.   It was tough today.   I thought I did a great job of kind of steering away from pins and putting it in the middle of the green, giving myself a lot of chances. 
Back nine I started hitting some bad putts and didn't take advantage of some of the easy holes I needed to.

Q.   I always feel you putt your best when the greens are fast. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah.

Q.   These greens are fast. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   They're fast.   I was a little too defensive today.   That's probably something I'll take away from this round for tomorrow.   I was so afraid of running them three, four and five feet back.   It's so easy to do.   I left a lot of putts short.   And a lot of putts I hit short, I didn't see the line.   That's probably the biggest thing. 
Tomorrow I'll realize if I do run four or five feet by, at least I'll make a couple more to counteract the threeâ€‘putts that I had.

Q.   I don't know if you looked at the leaderboard, but Adam Scott is playing pretty well.   You're going to need to get aggressive. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, exactly.   I think it's going to help the golf.   I think I'm ten behind and playing pretty well for two rounds.   He's playing pretty phenomenal.   He's going to be a tough guy to catch, guy that hits it as good as he does and seems to have a complete game like he has, and the way he's playing now he's not going to come backwards.   Seems like an awfully special week if you can get close to him.

Q.   I'd like to see it. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I would, too.
