   BRANDT SNEDEKER:  I didn't play real well on the front but I made some key putts and got the putter going on the back nine. 

 Q.  Was 16 a key putt? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Very key putt.  I broke my 8-iron on the front nine around a tree, had a perfect 8-iron on 16 and tried to hit a big 9 and pulled it left exactly where you don't want to hit it on that hole.  The crowd was going crazy.  With Phil being there, I just wanted to get out of the way before somebody threw something at me or something and get that over with. 

 Q.  That was a heck of a gesture taking the cap off on 18 there. 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  It was nice, yeah.  I can't believe it.  The crowd out there was huge.  I've never seen anything like that before.  They were so excited, and it was nice to make a putt when I needed to. 

 Q.  What do you think of the crowded leaderboard that you have right now? 
 BRANDT SNEDEKER:  Yeah, I think it's great.  It should make it a good experience for Sunday.  It lets you know that somebody is going to have to go out there and shoot at pins and make birdies, because shooting 1- or 2-under is not going to get it done tomorrow.  You'll have to go out and shoot probably 5-, 6-, 7-under par, and it should make for some exciting TV and hopefully some exciting golf.
