BRANDT SNEDEKER: Made some putts today.  Hit it really good.  Didn't really put myself in too much trouble today, it seems like.  I was able to take advantage of good shots today.  It was a good day, good way to cap off the week and hopefully get some good luck this afternoon.  And get my pom poms out and hope to play tomorrow.   
 Q.  Bubba said you gave him some tips before the week, then he took a shot at you on Twitter.  I didn't think that was too kind.  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Oh, that's Bubba for you.  You can't always get the great guy, he's got post something else in there.  We played a practice round.  I some saw stuff.  He asked me to take a look at his putting and I saw some stuff that I have seen for a while.  I told him what I would do differently.  He seems to be rolling it way better.  I was giving him a hard time.  You've got nowhere to go but up.  You're not putting very good right now at all.  Can't get much worse than it is.  It was fun, glad to see he's playing well.  Hopefully I can make it in the playoff this afternoon and see what happens tomorrow.   
 Q.  Andy Sullivan is down two.  Are you going to stay and watch?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: No, I'm going to go watch.  I feel like it might be a little too much to sit here and openly root against William.  So I'll go back and watch it.  Hopefully Andy can make some putts.  He's struggling with that right now.  Hope he can get something going and I'll be the beneficiary of it.
