  Q. How is the course playing out there today?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Brutal. Absolutely brutal. I'm glad to get out of there with what I did. My short game was unbelievable today. I made a lot of great up-and-downs. It's just playing tough. You got to hit really good shots and make 7, 8-footers for par.   
  
  Q. How is that wind affecting play today?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Just making the course play that much harder. It's that much harder to hit the fairways, that much harder to hit the greens and the ball's just on the greens the greens are so tricky uphills, downhills that wind even affects them on the greens. So it's, it makes it that much harder to pull a club out there.  
  
  Q. Pretty satisfied with 1-over?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Very satisfied. Yeah. 2-over. And in great shape going to the weekend. Put a couple good rounds together and I'll be good to go.
