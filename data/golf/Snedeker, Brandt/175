  BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I played pretty well.   Today is probably the best day I've played of the three so far.   I had a double, kind of killed me a little bit.   I was able to survive that and came back and made some good birdies on the back nine.   Played a solid back nine, which was kind of what I needed to get myself back.   Still a long way to go tomorrow, but I got myself a chance tomorrow, at least. 

Q.   Does it feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu, last year you were six back entering Sunday and now you're kind of right there in that same area?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   You know, ask me after the front nine gets over.   If I shoot 30 on the front nine tomorrow, it will start to feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu again.   I've got a long way to go.   I feel similar to what I did last year.   I feel like my game is really, really good right now.   I played great today.   I'm rolling the ball fantastic, if I can go out and do what I did today, I like my chances.

Q.   These late finishes have kind of been your thing lately.   Last year and then the Farmers Insurance Open.   Can you talk about that. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   You know, I have a knack Sunday coming from behind.   I know Sundays are tough.   If you put yourself 25 feet, it's not necessarily a bad thing around here and luckily a few times my putter has been cooperating, making a lot of long putts.   And I feel like I'm rolling it the best I've rolled it all year, which gives me a lot of confidence going into tomorrow.   If I can hit some greens and get some momentum going, it should be a good day.

Q.   This year a lot of guys have had trouble maintaining a lead after the third round.   Why do you think that's been?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   It's tough to win out here.   I think everybody get so accustomed to Tiger winning all the time that they kind of think everybody is going to do that.   And it's not the way it is.   There's too many guys out here that are really, really good at what they do.   You're dealing with the pressure and your own emotions on Sunday, it's a very difficult thing to do.   I think guys aren't afraid to go out and shoot a 63 or 64 on Sunday, and that's a good problem to have. 
I think the guys on Tour are getting a lot better, it makes for a lot more fun and excitement for us as players and also for the TV viewers.
