Q. Well bogey‑free round. That's got to be nice after the kind of wild ride you've been on so far. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, it's good to actually have the golf course with manageable conditions today. Even though it's still tough and in front of you, I was able to kind of miss greens in the right spots now and try and use your experience around here a little bit better. 
The course is perfect. Perfect conditions. We had not a lot of wind, greens are kind of still receptive this morning, so you were able to kind of go out there and be more aggressive than you have been.

Q. How close was a really good number for you today?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Pretty close. I had a couple really good opportunities and for whatever reason I made a bunch and three, four, five footers, which are tougher around here sometimes. But I needed to make a bunch of those 15‑footers, which is kind of what you need to do. 
But all in all, no bogeys, got going in the right direction, at least got one in the 60s and hopefully can kind of build on this tomorrow.

Q. With the course being in the conditions you said, where do you feel about the place you left yourself at, 2‑over?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, obviously, I'm not threatening to win the golf tournament, just because there's too many guys between me and the lead. And these guys are probably 7‑, 8‑, 9‑under par is going to be leading by the end of the day. Somebody is going to go low. 
So just go out there tomorrow and try and shoot something in the mid 60s. And tomorrow will be the day that's gettable. They normally give some good pins on the back nine where you can be aggressive, make some eagles and hopefully tomorrow I can kind of get the streak going again and make a good run.
