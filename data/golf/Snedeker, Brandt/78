Q.   Birdie, birdie finish.   Talk about your 7â€‘under round. 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I played great.   It was a lot of fun out there.   I hit the ball really, really well.   Didn't really have any trouble today.   Made a lot of good putts and fortunately none lipped out or didn't go in.   But I'm playing great.   I've seen this coming for a few weeks now.   I finally got a round in the way I thought it would go.

Q.   You seem to be going in the right direction.   I know you had a little trouble last year with injuries, but do you feel like everything's coming around now?
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I do.   I feel like all the work, all the changes I made over the last year are finally coming together.   I can play golf again and not worry about execution and course management that you really need to play well. 
I feel I've done a lot better the last few weeks and I'm putting good again.   When you're putting good everything else kind of falls into place.   So it was nice to make a few putts and finish the way I did today.

Q.   What is it about this place?   You're a past champion, what is it with about the Monterey Peninsula that you love so much? 
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   I love the greens here, I love the golf courses, the greens are poa annua, which I'm a big fan of.   And I love the format.   I have played the last four years with a good friend. 
To come out here and play these golf course, this year, you're not going to get a better conditioned golf course, perfect weather, everything has been ideal and there's not a better place to be in the country right now than right here and this tournament. 
So I have a lot of fun when I come out here and it's a fun feeling when you're playing good out on the West Coast.
