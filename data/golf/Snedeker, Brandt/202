  Q. 4-under 67 today, 10-under, obviously going to be great position for tomorrow, just talk a little about how you're feeling about your game and the round today as you're heading into tomorrow.   
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I feel great. I played really, really solid today. I made I think two bogeys and they are both kind of mental mistakes, but I had a lot of birdie chances and unlike yesterday, I just didn't make as many as I did yesterday. So hopefully I saved them all up for tomorrow.
