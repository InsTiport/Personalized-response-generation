  Q. Just a couple quick comments, top-five finish, got to be feeling good.   
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Yeah, feeling pretty good. A little frustrated with the way I played the back nine. I feel like I'm playing really well right now, and to shoot 2-over on the back nine, although it is playing tough, is a little frustrating.   
 But all in all it was a great week, considering I wasn't supposed to be playing here this week, I was supposed to be home with the baby. Excited about it. But I'll try to build on it for next week at Bay Hill.
