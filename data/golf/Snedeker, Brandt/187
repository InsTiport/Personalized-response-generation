 Q. How do you feel coming off the golf course?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: A little frustrated. I didn't play well today at all. I played really well on Friday and had a chance on Saturday to get something done and didn't play very well at all. Today was not a very good day all around. I didn't hit it very good. I hung in there pretty well, it could have been a lot worse, and I'm a little frustrated obviously, but I grinded as hard as I could and played as well as I could this week.

 Q. You knew what was at stake today with the Presidents Cup, trying to make that team. Were you thinking about it at all today?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: It crept in there a few times, but I kind of snapped back into the moment and realized I needed to hit some good shots and make some birdies and try to play as well as I could. Obviously it didn't happen, but I wish those guys all the best, the ten that made it today. I don't know who the lucky ten are yet, I'm sure it'll be close. But David played great today. I know David is on the bubble. I hope he made it. He played really special today, too, tough day out there.

 Q. Have you done enough the last 24 months to earn a captain's pick?
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I don't know. That's not my decision to make. Of course I think everybody thinks they should get picked, but he's got a tough decision. He's got a bunch of great players right there, a bunch of young guys, some old guys, some veteran guys. It's an unusual position to be in because he's going to make probably five or six guys very unhappy and one guy very happy. I wish him all the best, and if I don't get picked, I've had two years to qualify, and I can't blame Freddie for anything that happens. It's all on me. I take some comfort knowing that at the beginning of the week I had a chance to control my destiny this week, I just didn't do it.
