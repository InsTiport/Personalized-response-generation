  Q. What happened this morning?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Just missed my tee time, plain and simple.  
  
  Q. Were you just too busy --  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I thought my tee time was 8:20 and it was at 8:10. That's the first time that's happened in my career, and I guarantee it'll be my last. It's very frustrating, to say the least.  
  
  Q. Did that kind of obviously set the day off in the wrong way? Were you able to bounce back?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: Look, it happens. I'm not the first guy to do it, I won't be the last guy to do it, but I certainly thought it was never going to happen to me. Live and learn.  
  
  Q. What time did you get to the course this morning?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: 6:30.  
  
  Q. No traffic issues or anything?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I thought I was teeing off at 8:20, I was teeing off at 8:10.  
  
  Q. Where were you when you were informed?  
 BRANDT SNEDEKER: I was on the putting green. I sprinted. A little too late.
