 Q.  This is your second Ryder Cup.  We asked Dustin Johnson was what the difference was between winning and losing.  What was it like inside the team room this time compared to the last time for you?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It was family.  We had five vice captains, a captain and 12 guys that came together as a family.  We were going to win this thing as a family or lose as a family.  We were not going to have anybody shoulder the brunt.   
It was unbelievable to have guys pick each other when things weren't going their way.  I use Bubba Watson as my example.  A guy like him, showing up here, putting his ego to the side and saying, I want to be a part of this.  And he's the reason why I got around today.  He's the reason why I got my point today.  He was in my ear all day, walking with me every step of the way, letting me know he was supporting me 100 percent.  That means a ton in this kind of stuff.  You need somebody in your corner all the time.  We were in everybody's corner this week.  Small reflection of how close this team is.  There's been a lot of tears shed in the team room, a lot of joy, a lot of laughter.  You can't just manufacture that.  It has to happen naturally.  This team for whatever reason had that this week.  It's so special to be a part of it.
