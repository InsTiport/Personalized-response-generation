 Q.   You're one shot off the lead, feel pretty good after round one going in?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, I played really well today, just left a few putts out there, but I'm sure everybody did.   
So I feel really comfortable with where I am, how I'm swinging at it, and looking forward to the rest of the week.   
It's a long week, there's a lot of birdies that you have to make and we still have a lot of work to do.  
   
 Q.   How do you approach this?   This is typically known as a birdiefest, so you know you got to go low.   Do you feel that pressure a little bit?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Not really.   You know it's a long week and you're going to have lulls where you can't make a lot of birdies.   And you realize you have to stay patient and when you have runs, take advantage of them and that kind of stuff.   You can't look at the scoreboard too much because it changes too fast.   You just go out there and try to have as much fun as possible.   
   
 Q.   A little bit different this year being four rounds.   Do you have to approach it any differently?  
BRANDT SNEDEKER:   Yeah, last year was, last few times I played it's such a much longer event you didn't really think about stuff as much you had five days to really have a bad round in there and still have a chance to win.   The four rounds here you really can't do that.
