 Q.  What was it like for you out there today?  
WEI-LING HSU: I got pretty lucky on the sixth hole.  It was pretty like body in great shape and very focused and I made one birdie on the par 5 on a long putt.  Then on No. 6, I laid up.  I have like 100 yards for third shot and hit it straight.  I was like, looking good, and then all of a sudden the ball just dropped in the hole to make an eagle on that hole.   
And then the rest of the holes, kind of little -- just a little nervous and little negative thought.  Because I've still got three -- like two like three short birdie chance but I didn't make it.  At that time I'm kind of like, how can I miss it, I was like very negative, like what the hell am I doing.  I should be just thinking about how I made this putt.   
But you know, the back nine is a little bit longer, the second shots, so I don't get much chance to make birdie putt, like short birdie putt.   
But overall, I'm very happy with what I did today.   
 Q.  How far was your eagle?  
WEI-LING HSU: A hundred yards.   
 Q.  When was the last time did you that?  
WEI-LING HSU: This is my first time on the LPGA I holed out for eagle from like far away.   
 Q.  You said you started to get nervous?  
WEI-LING HSU: It's not really like nervous.  It's just like worry.   
 Q.  Because you were playing so well?  
WEI-LING HSU: And worry I'm going to miss the shot.  I was like, this is bad thoughts.  I should be thinking about how to make it, right.   
So I make another birdie on No. 14.  But 15, just mis-hit on the driver.  I hit into the fairway bunker.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy doing all of the media and everything, all of the attention this week?  
WEI-LING HSU: Yeah, pretty cool.  A lot of fans come out today and kind of surprised me a little bit.   
 Q.  What's your expectation for the rest of the week?  
WEI-LING HSU: I'm really hoping that I can get a Top-10 this week, and you know, you never know.  Still got three days to go.  So just keep focused and do what you need to do.  So that's it.  That simple.  Just keep it simple.
