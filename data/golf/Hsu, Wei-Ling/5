 Q.  Nice birdie to end your time here at the Pure Silk Championship.  How were you feeling out there on 18 to end like that?  
WEI-LING HSU: I was pretty proud of myself because I just made double on 15, which is very disappointing.   
I had a very good week this week because I made four eagle, which is set a record for my career.  But also made three double, which is, well, that's golf.   
But very happy for everything what I done this week.  And plus, I didn't play that well the past two or three months, so it's very happy to see myself top 10.   
 Q.  How much does a round like this and also just a tournament like this really boost your confidence?  
WEI-LING HSU: Actually I very like this course, and also, I don't know, this event just feel very special because so many volunteer.  I heard it's like 1400 or something.   
Very enjoy that, yeah.   
 Q.  What are you going to look to improve in the summer stretch coming up?  
WEI-LING HSU: I think I'm still making too much double, which is okay, but I really learn a lot from how to play under pressure.   
Hopefully in the future I can do better and just save those double.  Should be able to winning a tournament.
