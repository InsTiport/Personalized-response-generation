Q. Can I get your thoughts on today's round?
ALEX KNAPPE: Actually when I warmed up, I was hitting it sideways.  So I'm really pleased that I shot 4-under today with a good finish.
Q. Is there anything that clicked for you?
ALEX KNAPPE: Not really.  I putted well.  A few more putts could have dropped.  The drives were not good, not spot-on.  Almost hit no fairway today.  But then shooting 5-under is pretty good.
Q. And the conditions out there, very calm.  Obviously that must have helped with the scoring today?
ALEX KNAPPE: Yeah, that's the reason why guys are scoring so low.  There was no wind when we begun, and even when we finished, it was just a club wind maybe.
Q. The last three holes, birdie, birdie, birdie.  What a great way to finish.
ALEX KNAPPE: Yeah, it's nice.  I just picked up a little bit of momentum on 16 when I chipped it close, and then I hit it close, approach shot on 17 and holed the putt.  18 again, I hit it sideways to the right.  Hacked it out on the fairway, but I hit it close again and rolled the putt.  So that was nice.
Q. Good confidence to take you into tomorrow's round, as well?
ALEX KNAPPE: Yeah, of course.  I'm going to work a little on the range but it's a good start.
