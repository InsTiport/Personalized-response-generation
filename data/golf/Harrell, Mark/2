 Q.  (Recording in progress.)...drama in college, but you were a Ph.D. in drama this week.  
MARK HARRELL: Yes, I was.   
 Q.  Every match goes to 18.  
MARK HARRELL: I know, yeah.  Or even further.  It was a fun week.  Played some good golf.  Had a great match this afternoon.  Just came up one short.   
 Q.  I heard you only missed two greens; is that right?  
MARK HARRELL: That's probably about right.  Yeah, I hit the ball really well.  Missed some putts I should have made.  That falls on my shoulders.   
But he played great.  It was an awesome birdie on the last hole to beat me.  Hey, when a guy beats you, a guy beats you.  You earned it, so..   
 Q.  How far was your putt on 17?  
MARK HARRELL: It was about 12 feet.  It was just a little right-to-lefter.  Finally got one to go in.   
 Q.  How about this week for you?  Getting to the semifinals is the farthest you've ever gone in a USGA event.  
MARK HARRELL: Yeah, it's fun.  It was fun to have a chance to win it.  Felt like I was playing well enough to go the whole way.  Just came up a little short.   
But, be back next year and hopefully years after.   
 Q.  You get a two-year exemption for semis.  
MARK HARRELL: Okay, cool.  So hopefully get another run next year.   
 Q.  What do you think you have to do to get yourself over the hump and get to a final?  
MARK HARRELL: I just think match play is a lot of fun but it's a tough animal.  When you get up, you got to keep going.  You can't stop.  That's kind of what happened today.   
I had some chances early to get him a couple down and I missed them; just let him back in the match.  But hat's off to him.  He played well.
