Q.   First off, just give us an overview of the week. 
TODD MCCORKLE:   It was an incredible experience.   To play with a guy whose won U.S. Opens, for a guy who works in a pro shop every day, it was the thrill of a lifetime. 
I just can't put into words how fun it was for me.

Q.   Let's move on to today.   You're playing with Hale Irwin, how was that going around 18 holes?
TODD MCCORKLE:   Like I said, just playing with a legend, for a guy who works every day for a living, it was awesome. 

Q.   Coming back, hopefully, next year, is that kind of your plan, kind of get ready for the end of the year tournament here?
TODD MCCORKLE:   Well, if I ever get to come back it will be, it's more than I can even imagine, but hopefully I will and I just got to keep working hard and maybe I can get out and play with these guys again.
