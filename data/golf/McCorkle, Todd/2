Q.   What are your thoughts on your overall round today?
TODD MCCORKLE:   I played just as well as yesterday.   I had a really rough day with the putter and, yeah, I didn't feel real comfortable coming down the stretch, so consequently I played, my score was poor.

Q.   As of now you sit on the good side of the cut line.   Your thoughts going into the weekend possibly?
TODD MCCORKLE:   Yeah, I think I'll be around for the weekend, which I have to be real honest, was my goal to start this week.   But I would be lying if I say I wasn't a little disappointed with my play today.
