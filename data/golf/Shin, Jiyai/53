  Q. Tell us about your round, that was pretty neat.   
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, today, my golf was so easy. Well, I'm really happy with my shots. My driver, just one fairway missed, the last hole.   
 Today, really good putting, yeah, so I make a lot of birdies today. So I'm really happy now.  
  
  Q. How far were some of your putts, your birdie putts that you were making?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Longest is seven yards. Usually just two, three feet.   
  
  Q. So do you wish there was one more day and you could try this again?  
 JIYAI SHIN: No, I'm so tired (laughing).  
 I did my best. So the first time in Canada this week, so I really take good memories from it.   
  
  Q. Did the altitude bother you at all or how high up we are, did you feel that in the air, was it tough to breathe?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Some holes, it's very far at the green to the tee, some holes makes it really hard. This week, actually, my distance, about five, six yards is the longest. So better than me.   
  
  Q. What was your favorite part of Calgary?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, I really like a nice view of the course. The first time I've seen the Rocky Mountains.   
  
  Q. Are you looking forward to playing in Lorena's event in November?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, of course. I'm not 100 percent, because I'm playing in Japan. I'm just looking, maybe I'll play.   
  
  Q. If you would play, what would you be looking forward to? Would you be excited to play?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, they play only 30, 40 players, so very limited players. So I'll just play, and in MÃ©xico, I'm just happy to play.   
 Then I want to just enjoy.
