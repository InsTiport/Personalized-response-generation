 MIKE SCANLAN: All right, very good round today. You're in the lead now by three strokes. If you would, just talk about how you played and how it feels to be in the lead after 36 holes.
 JIYAI SHIN: Okay. Hello, everyone, thanks for coming. Today I really happy with my driver and my putter, my putting. I played very well. And then also, I didn't make bogey today, so I feel it's good. 

 Q. You don't know this course, you've never played here before, but why are you playing so well on this course? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, I came Monday night and then I didn't play Tuesday. I only played Pro-Am. And then I start the tournament. 
 Maybe, yeah, I don't know much this course, so I try to just make safe, like just middle of the fairway, just middle of the greens and make it a very simple game. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, of course, and then this week, my feel is really good, and then I find my tempo, great tempo. So I have a really good feeling right now. 
 And the course is really beautiful and the weather is perfect. I really just enjoy right now. 

 Q. (Your routine this morning?)
 JIYAI SHIN: I did a lot of sleep. I wake up at 11:30, and then I came in the afternoon to the golf course, 40 minutes, hit some shots and then about half an hour on putting. Yeah, I didn't know the golf course, but my feel is good, so I just practice and then get rest. 

 Q. The Player of the Year is very close, how do you feel about that? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I just focus on the game this week and not thinking about that at the moment. I'm thinking for this week's tournament and for the win. 

 Q. Your thoughts on playing with Michelle Wie tomorrow?
 JIYAI SHIN: I play sometimes with Michelle and she is so long, and I hit a little bit short. But we play very well this year and then we I think we will tomorrow. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: All right, Jiyai, thank you very much.
