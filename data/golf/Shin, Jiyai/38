   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, Jiyai Shin shot a round of 3-under par 68 today. She is currently tied for third. It was a beautiful round of golf.   
 Did you expect to play so well when you teed off this morning?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Um, actually, today my goal was just couple under par. But, well, I'm doing great. I did great. Last four hole I made three birdies, so...   
 MODERATOR: Last four holes? You birdied the last four?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Last four hole I made three birdies.  
 MODERATOR: Three birdies. Wow.  
 JIYAI SHIN: It was good finish, because last few holes was really tough. Yeah.   
 But, well, No. 18 I made about almost 30-, 35-feet putt. I made that and I feel excited.  
 MODERATOR: We heard the roar on that. Which holes did you birdie coming?  
 JIYAI SHIN: First I made birdie on 3 and 4, and Nos. --  
 MODERATOR: I was thinking about those last four holes.  
 JIYAI SHIN: I made 15 and 17, 18.   
 MODERATOR: Perfect. That's great. How do you feel about your U.S. Women's Open experience? Do you think this prepares you for next year?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Actually, just most everybody want most winning this event, and also I waiting for winning time.   
 But I think I really good finish this year. I play well this year, so I just waiting for the next year, too.   
 MODERATOR: Do we have questions?   
  
  Q. 3-under par, that's one of the best scores today as you're in the clubhouse. Did the course set up as such? I know that some ladies struggled out there, and that's what this course does.   
 MODERATOR: The course, how do you think the course played? Was it a little bit easier than it has been?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Uh-uh.   
 MODERATOR: Tell us what you think.  
 JIYAI SHIN: It's not easy. This morning, talking with Na Yeon Choi, and we say, Oh, we have one more round on tough course. So it's really, really tough for the players.   
 And then, well, I play very well today. Then I try keep focus on 18 hole, every hole. It was work, and then I finish good.   
 MODERATOR: There were some awfully good scores out there today, though, for such a good course. Why do you think so many people played so well and shot such good scores today?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, we already play three rounds, so we more knew the course measurements, like measurements, so...   
 And then everybody more comfortable with the greens speed. Couple days ago was huge rain, so after that rain green is a little bit soft. So we can hit -- be aggressive shot at every hole, so that make good score today.   
 MODERATOR: That makes sense.  
  
  Q. How was your experience here at Oakmont and in the Pittsburgh area and the fan base here? How was the experience overall of playing in this tournament?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, first time in here, and, um, well, I really appreciate lots the gallery, because every shot they clap for us. So I really happy play in there.   
 And then, well, and then pretty great course looking. Nice view, but it's really tough play. But I very enjoy in here.  
 MODERATOR: Are these the biggest galleries you've had for an LPGA tournament this year?   
 JIYAI SHIN: I think so. Must be U.S. Women's Open, everybody coming, everybody come to watching.   
 So I really like the crowd.
