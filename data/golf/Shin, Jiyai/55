   COLIN CALLENDER: I'd like to welcome the defending champion Jiyai Shin to the interview area. I understand this is the first time you have been at Lytham. Can you talk about the course a little bit.
 JIYAI SHIN: Hello everyone, thanks for coming. I played yesterday's Pro-Am. I played 18 holes. This course is so tough. It's totally different than Sunningdale because Sunningdale has wide fairways and the weather was good. But this week, fairways are so narrow and there are a lot of bunkers out there and the weather is more cold. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Do you think that keeping out of the bunkers will be the key to getting around this golf course? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I think so. Bunkers are so deep and small, so that will make it play hard. So very important to stay in the fairway. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Is St. Andrews the only other links golf course that you've ever played? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I played St. Andrews Old Course. Very similar to this course I think, like the bunkers. I played a few years ago at St. Andrews. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Was that your first links course? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, first in the Open. It played very hard two years ago, so I struggled a little bit. I had some bad memories but last year changed my mind. So I have confidence with this course right now. I know I can hit driver straight and that is important here. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: You come in here having won four events since winning this tournament last time. You must be very, very confident. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, that's right, confidence and in control, too. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Did that make a big difference to you, winning a Major Championship, improving your confidence? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, of course, last year before this event, I'm always thinking that the LPGA Tour is too high for me, too difficult for me, but after I won this, I got confident, like, oh, I can do this Tour with success. 
 And then the last few months, too. That has helped even more.
 COLIN CALLENDER: You spent a lot of this year in America. How have you enjoyed being in America? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I really enjoyed the LPGA Tour right now, and then I'm very surprised that I already two times won. I'm really happy with this.
 COLIN CALLENDER: I heard the other day that you had made a music record in Korea; is that correct? 
 JIYAI SHIN: That's right. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Would you tell us about that, please. 
 JIYAI SHIN: I did many for charity, I did special for charity. So I'm like putting the music, music to make money to give to charity. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Did you sing on the record? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I sing.
 COLIN CALLENDER: So if you win this weekend, might you sing at the prizegiving? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, hopefully I do. (Laughing).

 Q. Have you had as much experience in links golf as you'd like, playing in the wind and hitting the ball low, and did you watch Tom Watson at all at Turnberry?
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, I saw Tom Watson play. It was great. It showed links course always play tough, very hard. Fairways are really firm and greens make it hard, too. Before the last year when I won, I really worry about the links course, but now, no, nothing. I know I can do it.
 COLIN CALLENDER: Your English is much, much better than last year. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Thank you very much. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Have you been taking classes or just practising with the other girls? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Actually my caddie has been a big help for me. We always try to speak English, so that's a big help for me. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: What's his name.
 JIYAI SHIN: Dean Herden. 

 Q. I'm sure speaking to your caddie all the time must be a huge help, but has there been any formal lessons, or if you want them, do the LPGA offer them? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, in Korea, they have it for the Korean players. We have English lessons for the interviews.

 Q. And how many have you taken these lessons?
 JIYAI SHIN: A few times, not much, because we need to play the tournaments. So I did about ten hours, under ten hours I think, seven, eight I did. 

 Q. And didn't you say you played piano before you played golf, or was it the violin?
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, I played the piano a few years. 

 Q. Do you accompany yourself on the piano when you sing? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, I played piano but it's a long time ago and I almost forget. So I want to learn it again this winter time. Hopefully in the next few years maybe play the piano and sing as well. 

 Q. Do you sing in English or Korean? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Actually my songs only have Korean, but I can sing English songs a little bit. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: I think I'm right in saying 29 Korean girls, women, are playing this week. Why do you think there are so many good Korean golfers? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, I think you know, Se Ri Pak, 1998, she won the British Open. After Se Ri Pak won, we are watching, so many started in golf. So we all are thinking Se Ri Pak is on the LPGA Tour, so we think we try for the LPGA Tour. I think after Se Ri Pak won it made a lot of us believe we could as well.
 COLIN CALLENDER: And is there a big rivalry between the Koreans? Do you all want to do better than each other? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Maybe. (Laughing).

 Q. Do you base yourself in America and do you like living in America? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I live in Georgia, Atlanta. I just moved a couple months ago. 

 Q. Is your father there, too?
 JIYAI SHIN: Not yet. Maybe this wintertime with my family he will come to stay. 

 Q. Have you ever met K.J. Choi or any of the men? Do they speak to the ladies on Tour? 
 JIYAI SHIN: No, but I met him at the men's U.S. Open. I went to men's U.S. Open and I met K.J. Choi and we were talking a lot. 
 He said he watches the Korean ladies play, he spends time watching. He said together we are doing great. 
 COLIN CALLENDER: Thank you very much indeed.
