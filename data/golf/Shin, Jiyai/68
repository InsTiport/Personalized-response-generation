 Q.  Jiyai Shin of Korea is here and she says she has a little trouble with English, but she let her golf game talk for her today.  Finished at 1-under par 70.  A very good round.  Tell us how you felt about your golf game today. 
  JIYAI SHIN: Driving shot is all good today. Putting is just so so. But today is on the green -- 

 Q.  You hit a lot of greens. 
  JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, on the green. I get many chances for birdie putt. 

 Q.  You didn't make all of those chances though? 
 JIYAI SHIN:  Yeah. 

 Q.  But you did not have any 3-putt greens.  You had all 1-putt and 2-putt greens.  30 putts on the day.  So you must be pleased. 
  JIYAI SHIN: Today is a single bogey because second shot is over the green. 



 So it was very difficult approach shot. 
 So every bogey is a good miss. 

 Q.  Have you played here very much in the United States?  Have you played in the United States very much? 
  JIYAI SHIN: I'm just three times. I am playing in the Kraft Nabisco and the SBS Open in Hawaii, just three times. 

 Q.  Well, you must be a little nervous. 
  JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, I'm very, very nervous. Very nervous. 

 Q.  But that's a very fine round, 1-under par 70, for an opening round. 
  JIYAI SHIN: Yes. I try my best. And I concentrate, yeah. 

 Q.  Thank you very much. 
 JIYAI SHIN:  Thank you.
