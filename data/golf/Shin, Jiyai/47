 Q. Talk about your round real quick. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, today my putter was so bad. A little bit no have lucky today.

 Q. Okay. Were you looking at the scoreboard at all? Did you know what you had to do? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, I know that, and then I have nervous after last few holes. But I tried to just focus on my game. 

 Q. When you're out there, does the player of the year come into it, or are you just out there just playing to win?
 JIYAI SHIN: Actually, first my play was -- my putter was so bad, so I try just focus on my game. 

 Q. How often will you think of that tee shot on 17? Is that gonna bother you for a while?
 JIYAI SHIN: No. Actually hit was good, just wind take too far left. 

 Q. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Just unlucky. I saw the front, the groups that fly the ball, but just unlucky, I think.

 Q. How would you describe how you feel right now? Are you proud of how close you came? Are you disappointed that you came that close? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, actually I try make to (indiscernible), but it's golf, I think. 

 Q. Right. When you struck that chip at 18, did you think it might have a chance to roll in?
 JIYAI SHIN: Roll close. Really close. 

 Q. Yeah. And you were aware where you stood in relation to Lorena with where she was on the leaderboard the whole day?
 JIYAI SHIN: Uh-huh. Of course, yeah.

 Q. Was Jeff kind of keeping you aware? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I had to make for the goal for the whole day, so I every day check the scoreboard. 

 Q. Were you more nervous at the beginning of the round than usual? 
 JIYAI SHIN: No, actually last two holes I got a little really nervous. That's it.

 Q. Why do you think you did the last few holes get more nervous? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, it's my shot -- my putting was so bad, and then I have lots of chance for birdie but everything miss. 
 I feel make it tight by myself.

 Q. But it wasn't missing by much. Just like inches, lipping out. You were close, right? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Unlucky.
