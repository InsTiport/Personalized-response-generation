  Q. Well, you were close all day. Just didn't really seem to catch fire for you.  
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, today my shot was really good, but my putting was so bad. So I made lots of chances for birdie, but I couldn't make it just couple times.   
 Well, Michelle she played great today, she made birdies. So I just say congratulations to Michelle.  
  
  Q. Is there a shot that you would like to have back today?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Maybe No. 4 on putting green. Just a little bit right-to-left putt. I missed that. Well, if I made it, maybe I make birdie.   
  
  Q. You weren't able to put a lot of pressure on her and that makes a difference; right? You never were that close.  
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, everybody -- if you get close to me, everybody get pressure, and today Michelle, she get the pressure, too.   
 So I am just happy to finish second, and well, I appreciate the gallery and the crowds here. So I'm happy.  
  
  Q. Did you enjoy the golf course?  
 JIYAI SHIN: I am, yes. It's a pretty tough course. So I played very well. Just today wasn't putting as good. But I am happy with my playing.  
  
  Q. Is Michelle getting better in front of your eyes?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah. She's growing up.  
  
  Q. Says the 22-year-old.  
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah. She looks like she's growing up. She played very good this week.  
  
  Q. Mentally she's getting better.   
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah.  
  
  Q. You'll still go away happy?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, I am. And get ready for the next tournament. I'm happy right now, and I'm just hungry and I just want to eat something.  
  
  Q. Thank you very much.
