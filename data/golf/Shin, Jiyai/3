Q. Your first look at Seta Golf Club, and a cheeky 66, very well played.
JIYAI SHIN: Thanks so much.
Q. You were setting the course on fire, finished with a par at the last hole, but I hear, you just said you didn't miss a single green.
JIYAI SHIN: Yes, my shot was great, and I missed two fairways only today.  And, well, pretty solid today.  My putter was good.  It worked.
Q. Your putter was very good indeed.  Now, we miss you on the LPGA.  I mean, come back and play with us more often.  We know what a star you are, but has it been nice to catch up with your friends from the LPGA?
JIYAI SHIN: It is.  Also I'm missing LPGA, so that's why I can't wait this tournament, to see all my friends.  But before, when I played on the LPGA, I was busy, just go to say hello.
But now, another kind of different busy, because they come to say hello, which is good.  So I enjoy to play.
Q. You played so well today.  Now, we were talking about this on air that you have had 53 international wins.  I've got to ask you this question:  Can you remember all of them?
JIYAI SHIN: Why not?  Yes.  Yes.  So most difficult question when I got, which is the best win?  That's a tough question for me because I have a lot of great memory of trophies.
I'm just 30, so I'm still in the race.  I'm looking for 54th win this week.
Q. Clearly loving playing on the Japan Tour, and you've bagged two majors this season, as well as another win.  How much do you enjoy playing about Japan?  What is so good about this tour?
JIYAI SHIN: Really, I enjoy on the LPGA and the U.S., but here in Japan, we have a lot of three-day events, and I have a base in Tokyo.  So more time for life.  So life balance, much better and less traveling.  So I'm more focused when I'm back to the golf course.  I'm more focused on the golf course.  But I'm missing a lot of friends and fans out there.
