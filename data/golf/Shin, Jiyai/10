Q.   We'd better get a little comment about what has been one of the most demanding days in major championship golf.   How was it for you? 
JIYAI SHIN:   It was long, long, very tough day.   Even weather wasn't like‑‑ it was really tough.   But I just keep focus on my shot, each single shot.   And then when I made the winning putt, it feels like, oh, my God, I was so excited.
Then, actually, I'm really excited because I'm thinking, how can I say‑‑

Q.   Well, your smile says it all.   You wait two years for a victory on the LPGA and then two come along in eight days; it's extraordinary.   You must be exhausted after your efforts.   Yesterday, the round of 64, marvellous course record.   Today, everyone came back to you within one shot.   How did you maintain your focus and your concentration out there?
JIYAI SHIN:   I think this course is made for me.   My shot was great this week from last week.   So I have a great confidence about here and then I have a great memory with this tournament, so always when I come to the British Open, I really enjoy by myself and it helped my game today.

Q.   How special is it?   You won at Sunningdale, a beautiful inland course, but this really is the mark of a golfer to win on a links course; how special is it for you? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Actually, before when I'm thinking my shot, my skill is not good for the links course, but finally, I had a great tempo with my swing at the moment, so finally I got to know, it's working on links course, too. 
When I won at Sunningdale, it's a totally different type of course.   But Sunningdale was my favourite golf course, but also here, Royal Liverpool is another of my favourite courses.
