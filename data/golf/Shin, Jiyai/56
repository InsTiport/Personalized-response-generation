 Q. Par-5s were good to you today. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah. First hole, No. 1, I made bogey. So missed the second shot, so missed the fairway. So played very hard, missed the green to just bogey. And then No. 5, and then my search, I miss, and then I made bogeys. 
 Yeah, I always think about par-5 is always chance for birdie, but today I made bogey, so a little bit sad, but I did another hole, grate recovery shot, so it's fine. 

 Q. You shoot 3-under par the last round of the Women's Open, though. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah. Of course. Actually, yesterday is a lot of rain, so fairway is very soft and the green was soft, too. So every shot I can, I attack direct to the pin, so I can make good scores today.

 Q. Was it a difficult adjustment to go from a course that was firming up a little more each day to play a course that was a little softer today?
 JIYAI SHIN: Today, a few holes teeing ground was forward, so some holes played very easy, but feels like a little different because yesterday was so firm, so big image in my memory, so first nine holes, I'm very worried of the shots, yeah, today it was shot, but I'm worried about too firm. But I think last night, a lot of rain helped for today. 

 Q. How did you play No. 10?
 JIYAI SHIN: I hit driver direct to green, and then a little bit short, about 15 yards and then chip in and then easy make birdie.

 Q. Thank you very much. Great finish. Appreciate it. 
 JIYAI SHIN: Thank you very much.
