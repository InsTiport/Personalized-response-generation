 Q. Looks like you made a great save. 
 JI-YAI SHIN: My round, I hit my irons very good, but tough day. 

 Q. What was it like playing with Yuri? Had you played with her? 
 JI-YAI SHIN: Oh, we played before two times in Japan. 

 Q. And how did those two times end up? Did you win either one of those times? 
 JI-YAI SHIN: In Japan she won both of those. 

 Q. How confident are you of playing in an LPGA event in a major? What has this experience been like this week? 
 JI-YAI SHIN: I don't know, I'm always trying for this week and this tournament and the LPGA Tour. I feel like last week, Evian Masters, so that's three or four rounds good, but first round, second round was so-so. It's very hard training. I think it's much better this course. 

 Q. And what are you looking forward to about tomorrow? 
 JI-YAI SHIN: Just one stroke at a time. 

 Q. What do you think it will take to win? What do you think your score will have to be? 
 JI-YAI SHIN: First few holes make a birdie, first hole, second hole. Birdie the first two holes.
