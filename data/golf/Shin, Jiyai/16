 Q.   I know not quite the performance that you were hoping for today, but overall can you take me through your day and how it was out there?   
JIYAI SHIN:   Well, I did my best the whole time.   But I know I missed a few putts, and then I hit it okay.   But the wind was stronger than yesterday, so it was pretty tough to play with the long clubs.   
Well, I'm just happy to play with Yani, and it was great watching her play good.  
   
 Q.   I was going to say watching what she was able to do last year and now this year, three wins in five starts for her, how impressed have you been by her play and how she's consistently put together these performances?   
JIYAI SHIN:   Actually, it's very impressive because she won last week‑‑ actually, two weeks to win is pretty tough because the mental is hard to control because she already has a lot of wins.   
But when I play with her and I see her, she's great at focusing on her game.  
   
 Q.   I was going to say even today it looked like her demeanor was pretty calm.   She was comfortable out there.   Does she have a different mentality almost when she goes out there with the lead like she did today?   
JIYAI SHIN:   You can see in her face she has a lot of confidence.   Even her swing, too, she has a great follow through and good alignment right now, so that makes her strong.  
   
 Q.   It's been a good start to the year for you.   You're off to playing well in the first few events.   Overall, how do you feel about the state of your game heading into Kraft next week?   
JIYAI SHIN:   I'm just saving for winning next week (laughing).   Actually, I feel really good.   Well, I didn't play good today, but I feel like winning is coming soon.
