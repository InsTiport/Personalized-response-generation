   MODERATOR: You're suffering from the heat. Just tell us a little bit what happened there. You're suffering from the heat, the hot weather? Tell us what happened there.   
 JIYAI SHIN: Okay. First I want to say thank you for coming. Well, I really surprise here it's so hot and humid, so I try to make my physically condition.   
 Well, it's really hot and sunny all day, so green and fairways getting firm, like concrete. Well, then -- but they're like really hard to play.   
 MODERATOR: You've played well since you had an appendectomy. You played well and bounced back from that. What do you expect from yourself this week?  
 JIYAI SHIN: I already play last two weeks and I play very well. I think I feel my shot is getting better. Yeah, last Sunday I shot 64, so I have good condition and I have good confidence too.   
 And I already play course is very hard; green is very hard to read. It's very challenging course.   
 MODERATOR: We'll just take a couple of questions here.  
  
  Q. Did you have to cut your practice round short? Will you get an IV? How does this affect your preparations for the tournament?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Actually some holes very long, but fairways so firm. Usually I'm using mid-iron or long iron, so...   
 But I have consistence with my driver shot and iron shots. Very important on green, I think.   
 (Through translation.)   
 Well, I feel good first, and then I came early this morning. I'm already done my practice too. Because the afternoon it's so hot, so I practice early in the morning time.  
 MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
