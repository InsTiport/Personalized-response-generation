Q.   So how do you find the tournament in general, the HSBC tournament? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Actually, well, I have a great experience right here.   And then so when I come back to the Tanah Merah and Singapore, it feels like home.   And HSBC, they are great supporters for the tournament, so I really appreciate that.   They prepare a lot for this week. 
So the players enjoy the tournament, and then also, a lot of golf fans and a lot of gallery, easier to come watching and make fun, it's really great.

Q.   How do you find the Tanah Merah course as a competition course? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Actually, it's not easy actually.   It plays well but we have to focus every shot.   Even short putts, I missed a couple putts this week, but the green is so tough.   Hard to read and then course is pretty long distance.   So pretty tough for the golfers. 

Q.   What do you find is the biggest challenge for you on the course? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Well, I think this course, need more consistent to play every hole, because so many like bunkers. 

Q.   It's not predictable?
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes.   It's not easy.   But when I play the last few years, it was windy, but this year, it was not‑‑ really hot, actually.   So actually I'm more focussed for the physical conditioning. 

Q.   So you're feeling well placed for your round tomorrow, being that you've played 2‑under par every day; so you've been very consistent. 
JIYAI SHIN:   I think I just keep for tomorrow. 

Q.   Stay consistent? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes.   And then well, I had a good birdie chance the last couple days.   I missed both my putts.   So if I practise a little bit more putting, it should work tomorrow.

Q.   And do you think it will help having won here before? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes, true, I think the key is the back nine, because a few holes is really tough, hard to make par, too.   So try to‑‑ less mistakes.
