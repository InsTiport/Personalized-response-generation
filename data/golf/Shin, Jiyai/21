 Q. 4-under, nice playing. How are you feeling, and I know this is the first event back after having some time off, is this the first event back?
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, it is. I had a break time over one month. Actually yesterday when I came to the golf course, I was really nervous, and because for a long time I didn't play. 
 I'm not usually have pressure, but I came back to here and I say, my God, so nervous here. And then I play, I enjoy yesterday, and then today, I played early. But still, lots of Korean fans come to watch me. So I appreciate today my gallery.
 And then, well, actually, the weather is perfect this year, yes, so nice, warm, no wind. Happy to be here.

 Q. Can you tell me about the injury? I know it was your back. 
 JIYAI SHIN: I would say -- in English, my back -- I'm thinking. Well, I changed my swing a little bit. Like I try to get more distance, so I got more distance, over 15 yards, but gave pressure on my back and stress, too, so my back is getting tight. And, well, the back pain started at Canada, but it was okay, not bad. 
 But after Canada, I played in Korea, and you know, normally Korea golf course is very hilly, so when I walked on the mountains, getting more painful. 
 So yeah, it was hard choice, hard to withdraw a couple of the events. And you know, Arkansas, I won a couple of years ago, so I have a good memory of it there. I really feel sad and sorry about my fans. 

 Q. Feeling good now and the golf swing is feeling good? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, the doctor said, "Oh, you're very lucky to come early." So I'm clean now and I'm ready for all of the tournaments now. So I feel really good.
