  Q. 5-under today, firing well today.   
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, still today, I still get a lot of birdie chance, chance for the lead, but still made five birdies. But I'm too much back.  
  
  Q. How many could you have made?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Seven more. Actually I'm thinking 9 or 8 should be chance to win, so I try to make that score. But unfortunately my putter.  
  
  Q. Was it the putting?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, yes, because last three days, this week, I've missed the fairway just four times, and I missed the greens a few times. So my shot was perfect, actually.   
 Well, still, it's good, because I'm good play today, so I think I'm more ready for after tournament.   
  
  Q. Where are you going next? Are you going to Japan?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes, I'm go to Japan, I play one tournament and get to rest with my family.  
  
  Q. What does this tournament mean to you as reigning champion?  
 JIYAI SHIN: It was very special for me, because I guess first time LPGA Tour card, and it's the first time I won here, so many Singapore people remember me so I really thank them for that.   
  
  Q. And would you like to get that trophy back next year?  
 JIYAI SHIN: Yes. Very close, so should be next year I want to play more.
