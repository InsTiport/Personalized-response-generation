Q. Does signing all the autographs ever get old?
JIYAI SHIN: I try.
Q. It has to be such a good feeling to walk off the golf course and have everyone waiting there for you?
JIYAI SHIN: It is, especially in Japan, like very popular the women's golf now.  The gallery, the gates open at like around 7:00 a.m., and still people coming at 7:00 a.m..
I'm just thankful to them to come to see, watching us.  And then in here, we play on the tournament, but when the people coming and watching us, it makes it more fun, more exciting.
Q. Makes you want to go out and play for them.
JIYAI SHIN: That's right.  So I can't pass that up.
Q. So tell us about your round today.  Nice 3-under round for you?
JIYAI SHIN: Well, a big up and down.  I missed three greens today, but my shot wasn't that bad.  But just I make the big miss.  I made three bogeys, but it is golf, and then I make the more good birdies today.
And I think I'm still in a good position, and then we can see that many players make a big score each day.  Who knows, it could be coming tomorrow for me.
Q. Minjee shot an 8-under today, and you're only four strokes back.  So you wake up tomorrow, you have a good day and everything could change.
JIYAI SHIN: Yes, I very look forward to tomorrow.
