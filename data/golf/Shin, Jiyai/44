 Q. 1-under today, a better start than last year, and you still won it. So how are you feeling? 
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, today I made more chances for the birdies, but I missed a lot of putts just inside ten feet. 
 But my shot and concentration is really good, and I have three more rounds, and I feel really confident right now. I don't know why, because I think last year is good memories. 

 Q. And knowing that you can shoot a 66, are you confident that you can maybe do that again?
 JIYAI SHIN: I think could be my putting could just come back to 66, or better score. 

 Q. Do you want to go practise and work on anything?
 JIYAI SHIN: No, I need a rest because today was really hot, so hot. I feel it's too much lost my water. 

 Q. Pretty tight leaderboard out there today, what's your game plan for the next few days?
 JIYAI SHIN: Well, I just focus on my game.
