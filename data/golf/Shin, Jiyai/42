  Q. So you're still sitting at 2-under, even for today. You had a difficult seventh hole again.  
 JIYAI SHIN: I made first two birdies, really good feeling, but I made again on 7 hole double-bogey, so my feeling is a little bit down.   
 But I try to get more better feel, but I made lots of chance for birdie, but it was always downhill putts.   
  
  Q. The back nine, you felt was better?   
 JIYAI SHIN: Yeah, I get six, seven chances for birdie, but everything is downhill, so that's really tough.   
  
  Q. Your caddie still thinks that you have a fighting chance to come back and win it tomorrow; do you agree?   
 JIYAI SHIN: I think I need to practise now.
