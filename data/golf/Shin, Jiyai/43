 Q. How do you feel about your round today?
 JIYAI SHIN: I finished at 2-under and I made lots of birdied today, 6-under, but two holes I played like stupid. But I think my shot is getting better, because six birdies was the main point for me today. I have two more days and then I have good feelings still. 
 So tomorrow, I try to make no mistake. 

 Q. Good to see Song-Hee in contention? 
 JIYAI SHIN: I think so, today was really tough wind and pin location was really tough. Now the leading score is 6 or 7, so still a chance, because I think last year was more gap, but doesn't matter.
