Q.   Se Ri Pak had a great round today and shot a 66.   A lot of us were talking about what it was like when she came on Tour.   What a great example she set for all South Korean golfers.   Do you remember Se Ri when you were a 10‑year‑old girl when she first came on Tour? 
JIYAI SHIN:   How can I forget?   I have all the time in my memory.   I just thought after she finished, after she was number 17 something, I saw her score today, and it's just great play today.   Actually, this morning was cold, so I was really glad she played good. 
A lot of Korean and a lot of fans are waiting for Se Ri to be back.   She's doing well.   I know she works hard every time.   Because she is already a member of the Hall of Fame, but she is still training hard and practicing hard, so we knew that she'd come back.

Q.   Was she a role model not just for you but so many of the South Korean golfers that are out here? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Oh, even me too, yeah, of course.   When I started golf all the Korean juniors were watching Se Ri's win in 1998 at the U.S. Open.   So after that I started. 
She is a role model for the juniors and professionals too.

Q.   Another solid round for you today.   You re near the top of the leaderboard.   You came so close to winning this event last year.   What does it mean for you now to be back up there and in contention again here? 
JIYAI SHIN:   You know what?   A lot of people asked me a lot of the same questions.   I played yesterday and today I played with Sandra.   It was a great match from last year.   So I don't know.   This is a Korean company sponsor, so it feels like, oh, I have to do this.   I want to win on this tournament. 
So a lot of Koreans live here and came to watch us.   I feel like I'm ready.   It's time.

Q.   How are you feeling about your game coming into this week?   You've been playing well at the start of the year.   Are you feeling pretty good about it overall? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes.   Actually, this green is pretty spongy, so every putt we have to focus because even a couple foot putt is not easy. 
So I'm all the time focused with my putting speed and putting stroke because my shot is doing well since January.   So I just keep practicing and keep going.
