  Q.  Ji-Yai Shin, 3-under par for the championship.  She was 2-under on today's round.  How many holes did you play yesterday in this round?  Where did you start today?   
   JI-YAI SHIN: I started on today's No. 1 hole. Yesterday I'm not playing.   
  
  Q.  So you played 18 holes today?   
 JI-YAI SHIN:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Okay.  That's a fine round.  It didn't bother you having to sit out for awhile yesterday?   
   JI-YAI SHIN: No, a little bit tired. But today's weather is good. So today I play good.   
  
  Q.  You hit 12 fairways, drove the ball well, and you hit 13 greens.   
 JI-YAI SHIN:  Um-hum.   
  
  Q.  And you putted well.  Is there any part of your game that you're worried about?   
   JI-YAI SHIN: First nine is, today, not good driver. But better front nine with driver.   



 And my shots and putts were all better.   
  
  Q.  What do you plan to do between rounds today?  For relaxing or practicing?  Because likely we're teeing off in the afternoon, what do you plan to do as rest or practice?   
 JI-YAI SHIN:  I'm hungry.  I want to have lunch.   
  
  Q.  Will you practice then?   
   JI-YAI SHIN: Practice, a little bit putt practice, because it's very hot and I'm very tired.   



 I think that a little bit practice, yes.   
  
  Q.  Is your family here?   
 JI-YAI SHIN:  No.  No.   
  
  Q.  You're by yourself?   
 JI-YAI SHIN:  Yeah.
