Q.   You must be come in here feeling very confident? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Very much, confidence, too. 

Q.   How hard was it out there today? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Today actually I think today is lucky because the weather was great and then the wind was just a breeze.   It's just like a little bit strong but the local people say it's just breeze. 

Q.   But the scoring is still quite high, even with very little wind? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes, it's true.   The course is really tough.   It's very tight and then the greens are very small.   Great, every shot, driver, putter.   So I'm really happy with my score today.   I made the two bogeys. 

Q.   You birdied the third, how did you birdie the third? 
JIYAI SHIN:   I chip it in. 

Q.   From how far way? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Over 15 yards.   Actually third hole is really tough hole for me because I hit a driver and then hit a 3‑wood on the fairway. 

Q.   Still short?
JIYAI SHIN:   Still short of the green and I hit a 50‑degree, my wedges, about 15 yards.   I was surprised. 

Q.   And you bogeyed the sixth? 
JIYAI SHIN:   I hit it great.   I hit on the green but 3‑putt. 

Q.   And the 10th?   Birdie at the 10th, par 5? 
JIYAI SHIN:   I hit a driver, good 3‑wood and I left it about 75 yards to the pin and then about 15 feet, a little bit right side of the flag and I made it. 

Q.   And you also birdied the 12th? 
JIYAI SHIN:   I hit driver and I hit 7‑iron, and it was pretty long putt, about 30, 35 feet and I made that. 

Q.   Bogey at 14? 
JIYAI SHIN:   I hit a driver and it missed the fairway.   I hit it on the bunker right side, far bunker, 8‑iron on and 2‑putt.

Q.   Is the key to hit the ball in the fairway?
JIYAI SHIN:   It's very important. 

Q.   The rough is pretty thick, isn't it? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yeah, and the fairways are pretty tight, too.   It's hard to stay on the fairway.   And on the back nine, lots of holes, the breeze is left‑to‑right direction, so it made it even harder. 

Q.   Did you par the last two holes?
JIYAI SHIN:   17 was a tough hole, too.   But I hit a driver in the fairway and I hit a 5‑wood but I missed the green, right side to the far right, and chipping and like I hit it left. 

Q.   Overall you must be pleased with your round today?
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes. 

Q.   Still tired after the long playoff? 
JIYAI SHIN:   Yes, nine holes.
