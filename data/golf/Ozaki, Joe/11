JOE OZAKI:  No. 4, maybe 7, 10 foot.

JOE OZAKI:  Second shot, I hit 8-iron.

JOE OZAKI:  Yes.

WES SEELEY:  Number 16.

JOE OZAKI:  16, second shot I hit 3-iron and right side of the front edge and chipped in two feet.

JOE OZAKI:  Today and yesterday, so, so, perfect for me.  My putting --

JOE OZAKI:  And this week, change iron, new iron this week.  Yes.  And changing shaft, graphite.

JOE OZAKI:  Yeah, and this is maybe good.

JOE OZAKI:  Yes.


Q. Do you generally like courses that are playing tough, when the course is firm?

JOE OZAKI:  Yeah, for my driving distance.


Q. As far as the irons go, did you change irons as well as the shafts and what from to what?

JOE OZAKI:  Yes.


Q. What would the reaction be in Japan if you were to win this tournament?


Q. What does it mean to you to be tied for the lead considering how good the field is?


Q. Is this your best position in an American tournament at the halfway point?

JOE OZAKI:  Yeah, last tee --


Q. How nervous were you watching your ball come to rest against that fringe along the water on 17? 

JOE OZAKI:  Yeah.


Q. A non-member of the PGA TOUR has never won this tournament.  Why do you suppose that is and can you change that?


Q. How many events will you play here on this Tour as opposed to the Japanese Tour?

JOE OZAKI:  I hope 15 and 15.  15 in America and 15 -- but maybe more in America.


Q. After you made a bogey at No. 11, how was your momentum?


Q. Can you talk about the indecision about whether you were going to play this Tour again this year or not and how that decision came about? 


Q. You won two tournaments over there last year.  How much money did you win in Japan in our dollars, versus what you have won here?


Q. The metal part of your shoe on your right foot, is that obviously for the follow-through or is there -- do you drag your toe?

JOE OZAKI:  This one?


Q. Yeah.

JOE OZAKI:  In Japan flat, very hard, you know, and it help, no?


Q. What is the biggest difference that you have to make when you play in Japan versus when you come here?


Q. I don't know if it is true or not, but they said a  few times Jumbo comes here, he likes to bring his own chef with him to help him because he doesn't adjust well to the food here.  Do you do anything like that or anything to make yourself feel more at home?

JOE OZAKI:  No problem.

JOE OZAKI:  No problem.  (laughter).


Q. What is your favorite -- Tiger talks about MacDonalds.  Do you have a favorite American food or place to eat?

JOE OZAKI:  Yes, Italian, seafood and lobster and wine.  (laughter) American wine.
