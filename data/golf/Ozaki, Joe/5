 Q.  Couple of thoughts about the round in general. 
 JOE OZAKI:  Everything but 15 was good. 

 Q.  What was the problem on 15? 
 JOE OZAKI:  I tried to hit it good and then pulled it left and I should have probably laid up a little bit safer place to the right more, but I went for it and didn't make it over the hill and I had to hit it out again.  So that's what it was.  I should have probably been a little bit more thinking about my next shot instead of trying to go for it. 

 Q.  Going into the final day thoughts on that? 
 JOE OZAKI:  Take one hole at a time and just do well on each hole that you come across.
