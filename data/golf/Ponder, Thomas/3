 Q.  Obviously today going into match play, 36-hole day, what was your thought process knowing you had to work all day pretty much?  
THOMAS PONDER: Really just keep it in the fairway.  That's the most important thing out here.  If you get in the rough usually can't advance to towards the green.  Just keep it in the fairway, hit good shots into the greens, and hope for the best really.   
 Q.  And you came off a good first match today, 3-1.  How were you feeling going into the afternoon match?  
THOMAS PONDER: Yeah, I felt great.  Just a little tired after the first one.  Excited to get back out there.   
 Q.  I know you had a bit of a grind during the final round today.  Talk a little bit about it.  
THOMAS PONDER: Driver was in play; just didn't hit it close with my irons.  That's about it.  I mean, didn't make as many putts as I did earlier today.   
Course is great, and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  How were you able to get back into it?  You had a couple birdies there towards the end on the back.  
THOMAS PONDER: Yeah, just stay patient really.  You can only control yourself, so just do what you can do and hope for the best.   
 Q.  Can you get a little bit into the two birdies you made on the back and approach and distance from the green?  
THOMAS PONDER: So what holes did I birdie?  Did I birdie any on the back?   
 Q.  11 is when you took the lead.  Yeah, 11, 12 you took the lead.  
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: 11 was -- we par'd that.   
THOMAS PONDER: Yeah, we par'd both of them and it was just really solid holes.  I mean, just put myself in the fairway and wedged it in there close.   
 Q.  How were you able to maintain composure there toward the end?  
THOMAS PONDER: Just keep eating.  Keep myself really calm and just keep it in the fairway.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the quarterfinals tomorrow?  
THOMAS PONDER: Oh, man, I'm excited.  First quarterfinals.  First time to make match play.  Going to be really exciting.
