Q. So you took the lead on hole 2 with a birdie.  Can you tell me about that.
THOMAS PONDER: Yeah, I just had a 25-footer.  Just tried to be careful with the speed; drained it right in the middle.
Yeah, it was a good start.  Kind of bled coming in.
Q. It was a really close match the entire time.  What did you feel like you had to do?
THOMAS PONDER: Just really keep it in the fairway and keep making good swings.  I mean, he's a really good player and he's going to hit the fairway every time.
Just had to put myself in position to make good putts.
Q. This was your first time in match play.  What did you think of the experience?
THOMAS PONDER: It was great.  Baltusrol is a great golf course and really a great experience out here.
