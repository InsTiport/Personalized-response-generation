 Q.  Chris, I know a disappointing way to finish, but you got off to a bang of a start.  Leaned on that putter a lot on that back nine and just kind of ran out of bullets at the end.  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, definitely, it was a good day.  Kind of the opposite of yesterday, felt a little scrappy at the beginning and then hit it better as I went.  Today was kind of the opposite.  Really hitting it nice on the first nine, on the back nine, and just maybe got a little tired towards the end there.  It's all good.  A little bit of rest and good to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  I know you wanted that number to be a little bit lower, but to be in this position after 36 holes has to feel good.  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, absolutely.  Just to be up there close is definitely what I'm looking for.   
 Q.  Any grooves left on that sand wedge after the workout we put it through there on those last nine holes?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, definitely was a little bit harder work than I would have liked.  That's the way it goes sometimes.  I don't mind it.   
 Q.  Keep it up tomorrow.  
CHRIS KIRK: Thank you.
