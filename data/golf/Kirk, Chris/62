  CHRIS KIRK:   I played really well.   Made a couple bombs, including that one, very unexpected birdie on nine, after a bad tee shot and then made a 50‑footer, or whatever. 

Q.   What did you hit on your tee shot?
CHRIS KIRK:   Off to the right, and had a long ways in from over there, and was able to get a 3‑iron on the right side of the green, and made a bomb.   I felt like that was a little bit of justice for 18 today.   Hit my second shot just right of the hole and there's a rake ‑‑ they had these like old‑fashioned like thick wooden rakes here, that was probably 20, 25 feet from the hole next to that bunker, and it hit that, bounced over the bunker, past the rough into the hazard right. 

Q.   You made the 7?
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah.   Ended up trying to chop it there, and ended up hitting it over the green the other way.   I was in bad position and it kept getting worse. 
But, yeah, other than that one really bad break there.   And then I'd call it a good break on 9, managed to make a birdie, it was pretty solid golf.

Q.   How would you chalk that up, bad luck?
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, somehow I was able to see it with a little bit better attitude than I normally would have and get right back out.   And getting one close and making birdie on 1 and 3 and 4, obviously that helps you get over it a little quicker. 

Q.   What's your history at this place?
CHRIS KIRK:   I've played reasonably well.   I think I shot 8‑under here the first round last year.   And had a crazy, crazy week here last year.   I remember I shot 8‑under the first day and then played okay the second day and shot I think 5‑over Saturday and Sunday was 5‑over to be basically shooting myself out of the next tournament.   And then I was 4‑over and I birdied four of the last five holes to shoot even and make it to the BMW.   So that was a lot of really good golf and a lot of really horrible golf in one week. 
But I do love the golf course here and all the people here at the tournament are always really great, really nice to me and to my wife and my son.   And I know they enjoy being here.
