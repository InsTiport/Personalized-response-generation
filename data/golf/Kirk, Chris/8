 Q.  Good day's work today.  I feel like the condition is just so much more gettable than yesterday afternoon.  
CHRIS KIRK: Absolutely, yeah.  There were still some difficult pin locations out there.  But, yeah, compared to yesterday when we were playing in kind of blustery, 10 to 15, to basically dead calm.  It was tough to pick a wind at all.   
Yeah, obviously the golf course played much easier.   
 Q.  We were speaking off the air about the iron change throughout the bag really.  I guess the Mizuno clubs you must be pretty happy with them.  
CHRIS KIRK: Absolutely.  This is my first week as a Mizuno staff player.  I've used a good many of their clubs on and off over the past year playing without an equipment contract.   
After a year without one I just kind of looked at -- don't think about money, just what's the best possible golf clubs out there, and this is where I landed.   
 Q.  Seem to be paying off.  Now, much to do in Vegas, but a little football game on the weekend Georgia-Kentucky.  Your thoughts?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, I hope that the team that showed up second half against Florida shows up and we'll be all right.
