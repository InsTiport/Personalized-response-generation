 Q.  You beat the golf course today, too, bogey-free 65.  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, it was a good day for sure.  I'm just trying to look at the radar to see if I'm going to be able to get a flight out of here to get home or not.   
But yeah, it was a really nice day.  Played really well yesterday the nine holes that I played, and came back and continued that, hit a lot of nice shots and made putts when I gave myself chances.   
 Q.  I thought the golf course played pretty well considering all the rain we had.  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, pretty unbelievable that it's playable at all.  I had one casual water in a bunker, but that was it.  You would think after all that rain, you'd be taking casual water drops every couple holes.  I had one for the week, so pretty amazing.
