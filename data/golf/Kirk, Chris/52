 Q.   Following a great day yesterday, always tough to go back to back, but I know you have to be really pleased with your position through 36 holes.   
CHRIS KIRK:   Absolutely.   I played well again today.   I didn't quite drive it as easily straight as I did yesterday.   I missed a couple of fairways.   But no real wild shots and I didn't quite make as many putts either, but I still played solid golf.  
   
 Q.   The greens have been pure, but I thought there down the stretch a couple of them started hopping on you just a little bit.   Just the nature of the beast on a Friday afternoon?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, a few footprints, but, I mean, like you said, the greens are perfect there.   They're in really, really great shape and really holding up well.  
   
 Q.   20 consecutive cuts now.   You keep a spot at 5th on the list right now.   I know it's week‑to‑week, round‑to‑round, but do you take pride in something like that when you get to another week, like I'm going to play the weekend now for the 20th straight time?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Definitely.   I'm happy with how consistently I've been able to play the last couple of years.   But I also know that you don't really have to play very bad at all to miss the cut out here.   
I'm definitely proud of it.  
   
 Q.   What are you taking into this weekend?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Just trying to go see how well I can do.   I like the way my game feels right now.   And I'll just go see what the course gives me.
