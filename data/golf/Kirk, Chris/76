  Q. You find yourself right in the mix heading into the final round. Just a few comments on the round today and how you're feeling as you're preparing to head into tomorrow.  
 CHRIS KIRK: Feeling good. Today was one of the better ball striking rounds I've ever had and just didn't really make anything, to be honest with you, all day.  
 Had so many chances, it was sort of after you miss a few, you kind of lost a little bit of confidence and I had 10, 15 feet all day. Couldn't get any to drop, but the good news is I'm hitting balls great and I putted incredible the last two days. So I'll go to the putting green and try to find a little something that hopefully works tomorrow.
