 Q.   Chris, congratulations.   After what you went through yesterday, 22 holes, back out early today, another hard fought victory.   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, thanks.   The quality of golf was a little better today.   Yeah, just a really steady day today, two birdies, didn't make any bogeys.   And thankfully I was able to pull out a win.  
   
 Q.   Tell us about the putt here at 17 to close it out.   It's never over until it's over.   You conceded Louis' par, and that was a pretty lengthy par‑putt.   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, absolutely.   Especially after yesterday I had that straight uphill 7‑footer to win the match.   You definitely don't take anything for granted.   Very happy I was able to step up and make a good putt.  
   
 Q.   How quickly did you put what happened yesterday behind you to focus on today?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I was still a little bummed this morning to be honest with you.   
But once the round starts it's pretty easy to forget about the other stuff going on, and just focus on the task at hand.  
   
 Q.   Talk about, you still have a chance tomorrow.   What do you need to do?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I have to play a good round to beat Adam tomorrow.   He's a world class player, obviously.   And then get a little bit lucky with this new format.  
   
 Q.   A little bit lucky, but if it's the old format you're probably home this morning probably eating eggs at your house.   At least you've got a chance, right?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, no, it's nice‑‑ I think the new format is great.   I think it's great for the fans, it's great for the sponsors, it's great for everybody.   
It's really cool that even though you had a bad day yesterday I still technically have a chance to win the whole thing.   That's nice.
