 Q.   8‑under today, 15‑under, so you really got yourself into a lot of low scores out there.   You almost had to go at every pin.  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, this is the type of course when you're feeling like you're hitting it pretty good and rolling it right, you need to get as many as can you on those type of days.   
So I got off to a good start.   I was 4‑under through five.   And after that good start, I sort of said, okay, let's get it to about 15 or so and then give me a chance tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You'll be right in the thick of it tomorrow.   Is it an exciting way to see this as a finish to the year, or kind of an extension for getting into next year?   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I'm sort of winding it down this year, I guess you could say.   But, no, you want to go and play as well as you can every tournament that you play.   So I still have tomorrow, and then I'm going to play the Disney tournament when I get home.   So I'm still definitely in tournament mode, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   How do you like the area?   How do you like Malaysia, the course, the tournament?   
CHRIS KIRK:   It's great.   I love the course.   The grass is just like at home, good old Bermudagrass.   The greens are rolling just perfect.   So I love the golf course, and they really take care of us really well here.   It's a great tournament.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to catch any of the Florida‑Georgia game tonight?   Wake up early, stay up late?   I think it's 3:30.   
CHRIS KIRK:   I don't think I will.   I have a feeling I'm not going to want to see the score in that game.
