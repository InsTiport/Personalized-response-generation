 Q.  How would you assess your round today.  
CHRIS KIRK: I got out there, and kind of felt better and better as the day went on and was able to roll a few in there on the back nine.   
 Q.  You seem to play well in the fall; is there anything to that?  
CHRIS KIRK: I don't know.  I mean, I definitely had a nice little break.  The four weeks off after the BMW Championship for me was great to just be home with my family.  I didn't play golf much, just spend a lot of time with my wife and my kids and just kind of some R & R was really great for me, I think.   
 Q.  Perfect weather for the second straight day; how is the golf course performing or holding up out there?  
CHRIS KIRK: It's beautiful, yeah.  It couldn't be any nicer this week or last week at Sanderson Farms.  But yeah, the golf course is in great shape, the best I've ever seen it for sure, and the greens are definitely firming up as we go.  We managed to see how it gets this afternoon.  They might get a little baked out, but it's in perfect condition.   
 Q.  Are you a Vegas guy?  Do you like coming here?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, I enjoy it.  I'm not a big gambler, but I do definitely enjoy coming here.  The weather is great, obviously, and I kind of like Phoenix a little bit, I enjoy coming to visit the desert and playing desert golf for sure.   
 Q.  Talk about your day.  
CHRIS KIRK: I was pretty solid with my golf swing and had a few times where I got out of position, made some good saves, and the rest of the time was just pretty vanilla, hitting some nice shots and taking advantage of my opportunities when I had some.   
 Q.  When you tee off and you know that there's a guy who shot 11-under and you're chasing a big number, how do you put that out of your mind and just worry about putting up your own good score?  Is it hard to block that out?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, it doesn't really matter.  You know a course like this and the scoring that we're used to here, you know you've probably got to get to 20-something by the end of the week anyway, so the fact that he got to 11 on the first day, who cares.  It's a great round, and you're happy to see it.  Rod is a great guy, but he's probably not going to shoot 11-under every day.  You just try to play solid and make as many birdies as you can and be thankful it's a four-round event, not one.   
 Q.  How happy are you to be where you are then, considering?  
CHRIS KIRK: Great.  I mean, I don't think that 11-under is going to be leading by the end of the day, but still in great shape and just excited to get out there and hopefully keep playing well this weekend.   
 Q.  One better on Friday than your opening round; describe what it was like inside the ropes.  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, two very solid days for me.  I'm very thankful that I was able to play this well, and I feel pretty good about my swing and definitely rolled the ball nicely on the greens.   
 Q.  You only had a few top 10s last year, you've already rattled off a couple and are off to a good start this week.  What's changed?  
CHRIS KIRK: You know, last year my putting was very, very inconsistent and not very good most of the year, statistically probably my worst putting that year I've had since I've been on TOUR.  But I've worked on a few things, and it's just kind of felt good for most of this fall, so that's obviously a game changer.  My swing has been pretty decent all year, but just making some putts, you know how that goes.  Momentum gets on your side and it just kind of flows a lot better out there.   
 Q.  You're a guy who's had hot streaks before in your career; seems like you're in the midst of one.  How different is it shot to shot when you're executing and riding that type of momentum?  
CHRIS KIRK: The crazy thing is is it's not.  It's not that different at all.  It's such a fine line out here between playing really well and fighting to make the cut or missing cuts.  It's such a small difference, and when you're not playing well, it's so hard to see that.  But it's just tough.  Obviously playing difficult golf courses week in and week out, the scores are good here, but you start missing fairways and trying to hit out of the rough, you can't hit the greens, this is a difficult golf course.  Some guys will make it look easy when they're hitting it really well, but it's just, like I said, such a fine line.
