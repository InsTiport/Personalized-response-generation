Q. Well, Chris, you continue to play really good golf.  I've been impressed.  You have to be very, very pleased?
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, it was a solid day.  Didn't play like I would like to have yesterday.  Today it was just a really solid round.  Hit a lot of good shots and just didn't really make any mistakes.  One bad hole on No. 7 but other than that, no bogeys and just played really solid.
Q. Now you go against Branden again, even though it's a sudden death type deal.  Looking forward to it?
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, absolutely.  I had a lot of fun with Branden yesterday.  And hopefully I can play like I did.
Q. What do you do now to kill the time between now and then?
CHRIS KIRK: I don't have a clue what time it is right now.  I'll go and eat lunch and hang out with my wife.  My boys are here, so just go hang out for a while.
