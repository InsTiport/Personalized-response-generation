 Q.  You advance to the Sweet 16.  How does it feel?  
CHRIS KIRK: Great.  I feel like I played some really solid golf over the last few days.  Definitely caught a break there in the playoff with him making a bogey.  But that's the way it goes.   
 Q.  Now you will play Bill Haas in the round of 16.  That should be a fun match.  
CHRIS KIRK: Looking forward to it.  Bill is a good friend of mine out here.  I'm playing some great golf, so hopefully I can play well and give him a run for it.   
 Q.  We talked about it, you are playing at a high level right now?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, it's definitely getting better.  I feel like I've kind of made some slow progress over the last few months.  Feel like I'm working on the right things.  Everything feels like it's hopefully just getting better and better.
