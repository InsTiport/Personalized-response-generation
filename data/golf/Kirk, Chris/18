 Q.  Last in, last out tomorrow.  Good finish.  
CHRIS KIRK: Thank you.  Yeah, it was definitely a nice solid day of golf today.  I got off to a great start in the second round, shooting 5-under on that side.   
 Q.  When you get off to as good of a start as you did in that round and as long a day as this is, how do you try to keep that going momentum-wise?  
CHRIS KIRK: It was tough.  I definitely was feeling it on that second nine, you could start seeing some of the shots I was hitting, the way my swing felt, I was getting a little bit tired.  But it is what it is.  Everybody had to deal with it pretty much.  So just go back and get a little rest and get ready to roll tomorrow.   
 Q.  It was a slog out there, but do you feel like a wet golf course plays in your favor?  How do you find this golf course as it gets a little wetter?  
CHRIS KIRK: It's just like it was last time we played here, pretty much.  Maybe not quite as wet.  I had a good week then, so I feel pretty comfortable around here.   
 Q.  Have you found anything these last two days that you're going to take into the weekend?  
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, Scott Hamilton, my teacher, and I worked a little bit on Tuesday on just some simple stuff, ball position and that kind of thing, and it definitely got me hitting my irons a little bit better.
