Q.   Chris, great round of golf yesterday.   Today how about that hole at the 9th hole?   I know you would have liked to have twoâ€‘putted that 18th hole, but good playing. 
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, that was a little bit of a surprise on 9.   It's nice.   I was just kind of making a comment to my caddie walking off No.8, just that just hitting really good shots and things just weren't going in quite as easy as they were yesterday, but at least I got that one hole.   But I felt like I played pretty solid golf today and just hitting good putts.   I hit a really good putt from four feet on 18 and missed it.   That was just kind of the way the day went.

Q.   We always joke about it, you make everything, excited to come out the next day, and everything goes over the edge.   What's the deal?
CHRIS KIRK:   That's just the way it goes sometimes.   I've backed up days like yesterday with another great one, but today, like I said, my game feels good and my putting stroke feels good, it just didn't quite work today.

Q.   Starting the tournament 81st position in the FedExCup, trying to make a move, you've done that part so far.   You're right now currently 30th.   I know you don't care about that number, but it's going to get you taken care of if you can play solid through the weekend.   That's not all you're looking for, is it?
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, you can't get caught up in all that stuff.   If you play well, those things take care of themselves.
