CHRIS KIRK: I haven't shot any 68s.  Basically I get done playing, the game feels pretty decent.  It was nice today to make a bunch of putts and make some birdies and still was a day that if I cleaned it up a little bit better could have been even better but I'll take it as progress.
Q. Not going to throw too many of these rounds back, are you?
CHRIS KIRK: No.  Yeah.
Q. What was the key for you today?
CHRIS KIRK: I made a lot of nice putts.  I played solid all around.  I definitely made some more like the 15, 20-footer range than I've been making for sure and so it was nice.  Missed a few inside of ten feet that I would love but to have back, but, you know, it is what it is.
Q. I've got a couple just a couple quick Masters questions for you.  Going to have a little reunion of the 2005 team I guess this year with Kisner and Todd.  You guys going to practice together at all or --
CHRIS KIRK: I don't think Brendon is in the field.
Q. I thought he's in the field.
CHRIS KIRK: No, I don't think he's in the field this year.  Kisner and myself.
Q. Chris, 7 birdies you made to stretch out at the Bay Hill Club.  That was a pretty sporty start.
CHRIS KIRK: Nice to get off to a start like that, see a few putts go in.  I played reasonable well the rest of the day and a few mistakes.  I had some birdies to make up for it.
Q. Clad in green.  Is that a shout-out to St. Patrick's Day?
CHRIS KIRK: I almost didn't wear it because of that.  I was planning on wearing the shirt.
Q. Not the greatest starts for Chris Kirk to start the year, new clubs and changes.  Where are you with the game right now?
CHRIS KIRK: Feel like a little bit of work in progress.  I've been doing all the right things.  Last month my swing has felt really, really good.  Trying to be patient and wait for the results.
Q. Patience, you know how to do it.  Go and get some rest.  Good luck tomorrow.
CHRIS KIRK: Thanks.
