Q. Pretty good round here at this golf course.  For you obviously a past champion, not at this golf course specifically, but what went so well to allow you to contend again at a golf tournament that gave you your first win?
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, today was just solid, solid all-around day.  For the most part drove the ball well.  Hit some nice iron shots, gave me some decent chances, and rolled in, not everything, but plenty of putts when I needed to.
Q. What is the key on particularly this golf course?  The putting surfaces are so good, but the rough can give you some bad lies.  What is going to be the key this week?
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, driving the ball well is going to be a big key here for sure.  Yeah, if you're in the rough, you're going to have to be extremely lucky to get the ball within 30 feet or so on your next shot.  So yeah, you've got to drive the ball well, and then getting the speed on these greens is so difficult just because the downhill ones are so fast, it kind of makes some of the uphill putts tough to get to the hole just because they can be so quick.
Q. Help me out a little here because I think this rough isn't that thick and yet it can pose problems.  You hit nine fairways but still managed to hit 16 greens.  That doesn't seem to go together.
CHRIS KIRK: I must have gotten a few good lies, I guess.  Yeah, it's definitely that perfect length right now where the ball just sits right to the bottom, and you can really end up with some tough lies.  I think I missed the fairway on a few par-5s, so at least in that case I had the chance to just lay it up and kind of go from there.
Yeah, I felt like I drove the ball pretty good to only hit nine fairways, and they're just kind of tough to hit, I guess, and all in all not an easy golf course I don't think with how quick the greens are.  I felt like I played really well today.
Q. I think you have to really be on the correct side of these slopes because it gets really slick if you're putting downhill on these greens.
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, absolutely.  Getting the speed of the greens is so difficult.  My speeds today, if anything I left some putts short when I had those 20-, 25- footers, which is okay, I guess.  You don't want to run it four or five feet by, but thankfully once I got inside of 15 feet or so, my speed was really nice, and holed a lot in that range.
Q. They say beware of the sick; are you feeling a little bit under the weather?
CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, I'm fine.  I felt a lot better than I expected to, to be honest with you, today.  But yesterday afternoon was feeling a little bit rough, but a couple of -- I think I had like a two-and-a-half-hour nap and then went to sleep at 8:00 last night, drank a bunch of Pedialyte, so I got plenty of rest at least.
