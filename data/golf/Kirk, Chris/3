Q. How would you describe your round today?
CHRIS KIRK:   Overall very happy with it.  A couple of those bogeys on the back nine I would have liked to have over again, but hit the ball really well.  I had a couple loose drives to the left early on and was able to kind of scramble out of them and make pars.  Really solid front nine, 4-under, and just kind of cruising after that.
But yeah, you know, overall, really good.  Putted the ball really well.  Happy that I was able to get one back on 18 and hopefully give me a little momentum going into tomorrow.
Q. Three back of Brendan Steele heading into Sunday.  What's been the biggest key for you tomorrow to stay in contention?
CHRIS KIRK:   Just try to give myself as many opportunities as I can.  I feel like I've been putting the ball really well.  So if I can just hit it, just stay consistent off the tee and give myself a bunch of looks at birdie, I should have chance.
