 Q.   A little up‑and‑down today, but you hung in there, just two back headed into the weekend.   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I definitely hit a few more loose shots than I did yesterday and a couple three‑putts today, too, but a nice stretch there in the middle of my round, four birdies in a row, sort of kept me in it.   Made a nice birdie there on the par‑5.  
   
 Q.   103 feet of putts on the front nine.   Does that surprise you?   
CHRIS KIRK:   No, I mean, I've been rolling the ball pretty well over the last month or so, and definitely I like these greens a lot.   I definitely hit a few that I'd like to have back today, too, but I was thankful to make a few good ones.  
   
 Q.   What are the areas you need to improve on a little bit headed into the weekend?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Not be so tired.   You know, it's really, really hot this week, and this is my 28th event of the season.   I think that's sort of what I'm battling a little bit, just mental fatigue and being just a little bit worn out.   I'll try to get back home and get a good night's rest tomorrow and be ready to go.   
   
 Q.   Are you commuting?   
CHRIS KIRK:   I didn't last night.   I don't know, did they say when they're doing the tee times tomorrow?   If my tee time is 12:30 or so‑‑ actually tomorrow I won't even have to worry about traffic with it being a Saturday.   Yeah, today I had to stay down here.   I wanted to get to the course a little after 9:00, and that's not really possible from Alpharetta on a weekday.   Yeah, so I would imagine I'll probably stay at home the next few nights.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, hopefully‑‑ I'm sure I'll be able to get some updates from all the Dawg fans that are out there in the crowd.  
   
 Q.   I was talking to your dad about you having played baseball.   Was it an easy decision to‑‑  
CHRIS KIRK:   It was tough.   I mean, I loved baseball, but it was also kind of an easy decision that it was blatantly obvious that I was not going to play in the major leagues.   I wasn't a terrible baseball player, but I was far from a prodigy.   Yeah, I could tell at a relatively young age that I at least had a chance to do something in golf, and so I dove headfirst into it.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like some people are tuning in this week that haven't followed you all year?   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I don't know.   I don't watch myself on TV, so yeah, I have no clue.   I hope so.   You know, I enjoy where I've been the last few years being kind of under the radar and not having to worry about too much pressure or expectations on myself.   I'm able to just sort of go about my business.   Nobody really bothers me, which has been very nice, but you can't live under a rock forever.   I would love to play like this and be in the spotlight more often just because it's from my good play.   I'm not going to run around and do fist pumps or anything like that, but if you play well, you're going to get noticed for sure.   
   
 Q.   Do you wish the picks were made say this Monday as opposed to two weeks ago?  
CHRIS KIRK:   I don't care any more than I did a week or two ago.   I mean, it's not really that big of a deal.   Those guys that he picked are great players, and they're going to go do great.   I'm a little tired, and I'm looking forward to my rest.   
   
 Q.   You say you like being under the radar.   Have you felt differently the past couple weeks?  
CHRIS KIRK:   A little bit.   Still not too much.   I mean, it was‑‑ you can still see it, obviously.   Like yesterday with Billy and I in the last group and Rory and Bubba in the group in front of us, even though we were in the final group and playing good rounds, it's to the point where we were leading the tournament, and there was still five times more people following the group in front of us, and deservedly so.   Those guys have, whatever, six majors between them, and they're both really exciting players to watch.   
I mean, I don't see myself ever getting to that level of popularity, I guess.   I mean, I hope that I have a great following of people that enjoy watching me play, but my game is not‑‑ you're not going to watch me play golf, and I'm just not going to really wow you, I guess.   I hope to hit a lot of good shots, but it's more an efficient style of golf rather than an overpowering like Rory and Bubba play.  
   
 Q.   Do you hear anything called out of the gallery more recently?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, absolutely, yeah.   That's definitely been a big difference for sure.   There's a lot less of people trying to look at their programs and figure out, who is this.   Yeah, so that's nice to have people pulling for you and knowing who you are a little bit.   I've definitely noticed a little bit of a change in that the last month or so.
