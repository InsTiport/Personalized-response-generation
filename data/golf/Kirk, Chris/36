 Q.  Good playing out there.  You're at 6-under par.  Open up with some thoughts about your round.  CHRIS KIRK: Sure.  Yeah, a good, solid score today of 68.  Very happy with the way I was able to manage my game.  Didn't drive it my best.  It's been interesting the last couple days not hitting my driver quite like I would like.  That was sort of the strength that led to me having such a good year last year.  But was able to recover well and really putted nice.   Q.  You picked up a birdie at the last.  Talk us through the hole.  CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, No. 9 after I made par on the first eight holes of my front nine, my second nine, and just hit a 3-wood off the tee to just kind of get it out there and play the hole as a three-shot hole.  That's what happened, and I hit a nice wedge to about 12 feet behind the hole and was able to sneak that one in.   Q.  Overall thoughts about the condition of the golf course; is it hard, fast?  What are the greens like?  CHRIS KIRK: The course is in great shape.  I've been amazed, I was sick earlier in the week so I wasn't able to come down until Wednesday, so I just played nine Wednesday afternoon, and it was soft and the greens were slow, and to go from Wednesday afternoon to how firm and quick they are right now, Friday afternoon, is really amazing.   Q.  How do you feel about your position heading into the weekend?  CHRIS KIRK: Yeah, happy to be in the shape I'm in.  You know, there are a few things I'd like to improve over the next couple days, and hopefully have two solid rounds and see where we end up.
