Q.   If anybody is going to be happy, it's you, you're the only score that's under par in round two.   How good of a round was this? 
CHRIS KIRK:   It was one of the best that I've played in quite a while to be honest with you.   I really, really was in control and really was flushing it and putted pretty well, too. 
So to make four bogeys despite hitting about every shot right where I looked was a little bit crazy and tough to deal with mentally, but as I said, I'm going to be happy with the position I'm in once the day is over. 

Q.   At your level, you guys are disappointed when good golf shots lead to bogeys or penalties, and usually people say the word unfair; were the conditions, the setup and the course design‑‑ led to an unfair situation?
CHRIS KIRK:   Borderline, yeah, I would say so.   It was a little bit of a crapshoot probably with how it's playing out there right now.   Yeah, every time you make a bogey or do something, I would finish the hole and say, okay, what should I have done differently there and found myself sort of shaking my head and not really knowing. 

Q.   Is this more the setup, the golf course or the wind? 
CHRIS KIRK:   I think it's mostly the wind.   I mean, it doesn't matter what course you play in this kind of conditions, would be really, really difficult.   But the golf course is brutal now.   And playing it from where we are playing it, not a whole lot of tees got moved around, but for the most part, the golf course setup was all right.   If the pins weren't unfair, you know, it's just a really, really difficult golf course on a really, really difficult day.
