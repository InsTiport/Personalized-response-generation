 Q.   Other another solid round.   Just talk about how you played today?   
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I played nicely most of the day.   Didn't really make a ton of putts like I did the last few days, and I hit the ball really well and had a lot of that 10‑ to 15‑foot range for birdies kind of all day, but never really hit any close.   Didn't get very many of those putts to fall for me, but thankfully stayed patient, and hit a couple nice birdies in the last two holes to finish.  
   
 Q.   With that finish and birdie there on 18, does that give you momentum going into tomorrow?   
CHRIS KIRK:   I hope so.   I felt pretty good about my game for a while now, and I was just kind of trying to stay patient and let it happen.   This is definitely a golf course that I like a lot and I had some success on the course.   That's obviously going to give me some good feelings going into Sunday.  
   
 Q.   At 6‑under, certainly in the hunt with a bunch of great golfers.   What do you think it will take tomorrow to take home the plaid jacket?   
CHRIS KIRK:   The scores have been way higher than I thought they would be all week, so who knows.   It's really tough to tell.   I guess 8 is leading right now, but I think you'd have to get it to 11, 12, 13, somewhere in that range.
