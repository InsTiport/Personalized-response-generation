 Q.  Really nice tournament so far.  66, 68.  Talk a little bit about what you felt your strengths were out there so far this week.  
CHRIS KIRK: Everything's felt pretty solid.  I've driven the ball reasonably well all week and a lot of good iron shots and rolled it pretty decent too.  So it hasn't been one thing that's really stuck out, everything's just been pretty consistent.   
 Q.  So far here at this tournament your best has been a tie for 24th.  Hopefully you'll be able to better that.  What do you think is different this year in your game?  
CHRIS KIRK: Really think the way I've driven it has helped me a lot this week so far.  If I can keep driving it the way I have the last few days, the course is a lot easier from there, that's for sure, and continue to make a few putts here and there.   
 Q.  Another solid round.  Just get some comments on your play today.  
CHRIS KIRK: Thanks, yeah, another beautiful day here in Phoenix, thankfully.  I'm loving these 80 and sunny day, that's for sure.  But, yeah, it was a good solid day all around, I had a nice little stretch there in the middle of the round, birdieing 15, 17, 18 and No. 1.  I made a couple mistakes off the tee on the front nine that cost me bogeys, but overall just been really good solid golf.   
 Q.  Based on the atmosphere and kind of craziness surrounding everything, what's been the key for you to keep focused?  
CHRIS KIRK: I think having played this tournament a bunch of times before helps.  You just, you've got to expect the unexpected out there.  Everybody's going to have a few people yell in their swing or whatever it may be during the round and it's just the way it goes here this week.  So I think I just kind of cruise along and do my thing and just kind of ignore everybody for the most part.
