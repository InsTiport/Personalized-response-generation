Q.   Talk about what went right today. 
CHRIS KIRK:   I felt comfortable with my play and judged the ball pretty well.   Made what I needed to.   Made a few putts when I needed to.   Chip‑in on 17 was a nice bonus to cap off my round there, but all‑in‑all pretty solid game.

Q.   (Off microphone)?
CHRIS KIRK:   It was pretty good.   Some of the guys up there were having a little bit of fun, maybe at Billy's expense a little bit.   A lot of good effort out there. 
Everybody was mostly really great.   Saw some people I haven't seen in quite a while.   It's nice having my hometown crowd behind me a little bit.

Q.   You and your partner are co‑leaders.   Is that a coincidence, or do you guys help each other out?
CHRIS KIRK:   Well, we are Nos. 1 and 2 on the FedExCup list.   No.   I mean, we both had a solid day.   Billy's obviously been playing some pretty incredible golf with winning last week and finishing second the week before.   And I've been doing all right myself. 
So it was a comfortable pairing for both of us, I think, and the golf course played really, really well.   It was tough, but very fair.   And we both had it going pretty nice.

Q.   You guys play together much before?
CHRIS KIRK:   We have.   I think first time I've ever played with Billy was like a senior in high school.   I think we were paired together in the U.S. Amateur a long time ago.   And so I've known him for a long time.   We played together a lot when he was at school at Florida and I was at Georgia.   So I know his game pretty well and comfortable with him.

Q.   How did that match go?
CHRIS KIRK:   It wasn't.   It was in stroke play.   We played together in stroke play.   I don't think either of us made it to match play.   So not well.

Q.   How much does that put you at ease having so many people around you?   Get your mind off what is going on here?
CHRIS KIRK:   It's kind of tough to get your mind off what's going on here this week.   But may have helped a little bit.   I would have been comfortable with a lot of guys here.   Billy's one of many guys that I've become good friends with and have known for a long time.   There are a lot of guys out here on TOUR that I played against in junior golf and then in college golf. 
It's all the same here.   It's the same group of guys.   There's just not as many of us now.

Q.   A lot of good scores today were by guys top of the FedExCup teeing off late.   Does that say anything about the guys being hot now or any kind of similarity between the course you played the last couple of weeks make the same groups, same guys top of the leaderboard?
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, it's mostly just guys that are playing well.   Definitely the course didn't play any tougher in the afternoon than it did this morning.   There was very little wind, and so there wasn't any advantage like there is a lot of times going off earlier. 
But, yeah, and obviously these greens, sometimes greens can get a little bit spiked up.   But you can have a thousand people could play this golf course, all with metal spikes you wouldn't be able to tell.   They're unbelievably good and unbelievably healthy.   Definitely not an issue being in the last group.

Q.   Any similarities between the courses you all played the last couple of weeks having the same group of guys playing well each week?
CHRIS KIRK:   Not last week, necessarily.   I'd say this course and Boston are probably the most similar as far as it's a lot of drivers and it's a long golf course and not a whole lot of wedges in.   So it's going to favor guys that are hitting their drivers real well and obviously putting well. 
These greens, like I said, are in perfect shape.   They are very, very tricky to read with the grain, and the ball doesn't‑‑ generally goes with the grain, but not always.   So it can be‑‑ despite how perfect they roll, they can be tough.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
