 Q.  Chris, I know you had the emotions that you had when you made the team and were able to get in on points.  How difficult is it to know that you had to sit.  
CHRIS KIRK: Not at all.  We have 12 really, really great players on the team, so it's not disappointing at all.  I'm excited for everything to get started and get out there and watch, and even more excited, obviously, for me to get started on Friday.   
 Q.  When did you find out that you were going to?  
CHRIS KIRK: Jay came and talked to Bill and I while we were playing today.  Bill and I played together today, and I can't remember what hole it was.  Turned around and he came and talked to us about it.  With me being the only rookie, this is my first International Team, I kind of figured I'd probably sit one of the first two days.   
So, yeah, it's not a big deal.  I'm not any less excited about the week.  Just looking forward to everything getting going.   
 Q.  I think just so people know and they understand that the injury you had with your wrist, how has that healed and how comfortable and happy are you with where you're at?  
CHRIS KIRK: It's healed a hundred percent.  Yeah, and it feels really, really great.  My golf game feels good, my swing feels really, really good.  I still feel like I can sort of tell a little bit that I haven't played a whole lot of competitive golf over the last three or four months.  So I think that this will be really great for me this week.   
A lot of weeks after being home for as long as I was, it may have been difficult really getting back into it, getting focused in my first rounds.  But I really don't think that's going to be an issue this week.  I'm so excited about getting out there and playing.  So I think it's really going to be good for my game.   
 Q.  I know when Phil plays with the younger guys or guys that are playing in their first cup, he sometimes takes them under the wing.  You played with him yesterday.  Has he given you any advice this week at all on your first team event?  
CHRIS KIRK: Mostly just enjoy it as much as I can.  He's a great guy to go to for advice any time, always has been for me.  He's always been really nice to me since I've been on TOUR.  He was great to play with yesterday.  We had a blast.   
 Q.  Also, going through the week so far, what's been your favorite maybe moment with the guys that you've had this week that you can share?  
CHRIS KIRK: All the time together no particular stories stand out, I guess, but just all the time spent together in our team rooms in the cabin here and hanging out with all our wives and girlfriends and everybody.  It's just been really a cool, fun, relaxed group, and everybody had a good time last night at dinner.  We all went back and hung out for a little while afterwards, just enjoying each other's company and the whole experience.   
 Q.  You guys had Korean barbecue last night.  But you didn't have the octopus soup?  
CHRIS KIRK: I did not have any of the octopus soup, no.  I was heavy on the steak for sure.  I played it safe.   
 Q.  Are you sure it was steak?  
CHRIS KIRK: Somewhat.  No, it was delicious.  Really good.   
 Q.  For you, what makes a good fit for you as a partner in match play?  
CHRIS KIRK: I think someone with a relatively similar personality to me.  On the golf course I like when you're in between shots I want to talk about football, your kids, about whatever.  And then when it comes down to time to hit the shot, I'm not someone who even really interact -- I don't interact with my caddie a whole lot much less another player out there.   
So I think for me it's good when you have somebody when it's time to hit the shot, you stay out of each other's way a little bit.  There may be some times here and there where if you're stuck on what a putt's going to do or trying to figure out the wind or something like that, occasionally, but you won't see me having much conversation about the actual shot I'm about to hit.   
 Q.  How will you handle tomorrow when you are sitting, and what can you learn while you are sitting out since you haven't gotten to tee one up quite yet, but you'll be in the atmosphere?  
CHRIS KIRK: I think it will be a great experience for me.  Just on how these team things run, I have to lean a little bit on the teams I was on in amateur golf and the two Palmer Cup teams and the Walker Cup team.  But that was a long time ago now.  That was seven, eight years ago I guess.   
So I'm looking forward to being out there and being in the moment as much as I can be out there watching.  Really sort of try to get my energy up and feed off the guys tomorrow and get mentally prepared for Friday.
