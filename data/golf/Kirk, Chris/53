 Q.   Just what worked today for you?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Combination of everything.   I drove it really nicely, which you kind of have to do out here playing out of the rough.   It would be a long day on this golf course.   
I drove the ball well and hit good iron shots and made some really nice putts.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like the morning scores have been pretty good.   Is that the time to play today?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yes, very little wind out there, especially for the first half of our round, teeing off, it was hardly moving at all.  
The greens are rolling absolutely perfect.   I mean, if you read it right and roll down your line, it's going to go in.  
   
 Q.   The Georgia golfers this year have been tremendous.   UGA guys, even Georgia Tech guys.   This UGA connection, anything about that program, that tradition, that leads to guys going on TOUR and having successful careers like you and many of your peers?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Yeah, I think Coach Haack's philosophy there is really perfect.   He just recruited all the best players that he could.   And don't try to get one good guy every year; get as many as you can.   And made it a very competitive environment there.  
I think that ‑‑ I know he's done a few interviews lately and talked about the qualifying system, where if you don't finish in the top 10 in the tournament you have to go back in qualifying.   So even somebody that's going to be a First‑Team All‑American or have a great year‑‑ my senior year I played really, really well, but whenever I didn't finish top 10 in the tournament I was back in qualifying.  
Definitely keeps you on your toes.   And I know that when I was there in school we were all very competitive with each other and pushed each other a lot.   So I think that continues out here.  
   
 Q.   Prepared you well for this?  
CHRIS KIRK:   Absolutely, yes.  
   
 Q.   Just through getting a great first round in at a tournament like this, how does it change?   Does it change anything you do, get ready for Friday and the weekend?  
CHRIS KIRK:   No, not really.   I'm happy that I got off to a good start today, but we've still got a long ways to go, obviously.   And hope to go out and play as well as I can tomorrow and see where we go from there.  
   
 Q.   Have Thursdays generally been pretty good?  
CHRIS KIRK:   This year they have, yeah.   Last week on Thursday was one of the worst I've played in a while.   Shot 3‑over at my favorite course of the year, Colonial.   
You never know.   I've had a lot of good first rounds this year.   But some plenty of bad ones, too.   Just gotta keep playing.
