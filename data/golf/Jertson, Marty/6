 Q. Maybe not the result you were hoping for, but still, talk about your experience overall. 
 MARTY JERTSON: Probably the funnest golf week of my life for sure. Unfortunately, my mechanics were really there with my full swing, and with the pressure it kind of compounded. Today I hit the first two fairways and the last fairway but none in between, I don't think. You can't play out of the hay and hitting balls in the water all over the place here just with marginal swings. 
 But in terms of the experience, honestly, probably the best golf week of my life here. I was able to learn a lot about my game, so that's really a good journey. So you really just need to try to figure out what to work on and how to get better.

 Q. How does this course compare to some of the other courses you've played in the past?
 MARTY JERTSON: It's just when you hit a marginal shot, a marginally bad shot, boom, it's in the water or something like that. But if you're hitting it good, it's fair. That's the thing that's a little frustrating for me. Normally my ball-striking is the best part of my game, and it was the worst part of my game this week. 
 But in terms of rating the course, it's long, it's tough, but at the same time, I really think they've set it up fair. If you hit quality shots and you have a good strategy, you can get it around here pretty decently.

 Q. What are you going to be able to take home out of this experience?
 MARTY JERTSON: There's a ton of things. I kind of want to go back to the hotel room and just jot down a bunch of things. Playing with all the different guys I played with and learning a lot about my game and the grasses, the conditions, the environment, the galleries, you know, the list could go on and on, really.
