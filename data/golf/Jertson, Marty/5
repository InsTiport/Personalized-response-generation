Q.   Talk about your round today, 8‑over, probably not what you were looking for?
MARTY JERTSON:     Yeah, I hit a squirrelly tee shot on the first hole and got a great up‑and‑down for bogey, and then gave myself nice looks for birdie, almost had one on 2, made one on 3, almost had one on 4, and then some squirrelly swings.   I just started with my driver, kind of battling some swing issues, especially with my driver all week.   I made a good one on the last, so hopefully I can carry some momentum into tomorrow.

Q.   This isn't your first tournament.   Talk a little bit about how this experience maybe is the same or is different than last year. 
MARTY JERTSON:     No, I was a little more relaxed today.   Obviously the crowds aren't as big even though the facilities and everything.   In any way I think I was a little more relaxed.   It just comes down to execution.   I think mentally and physically I was in good shape, just didn't execute.
