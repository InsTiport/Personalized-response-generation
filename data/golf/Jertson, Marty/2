Q. Just your feelings about after yesterday's excitement to try to get back and try to relax out there.  But what were the struggles?
MARTY JERTSON: Oh, my mechanics were off.  I did not drive it at all like I did the first two rounds.  So I don't even know how many fairways I hit, but it wasn't that many.  Maybe a handful.  So it was all off the tee.  And then the putts that I was making and burning edges, and had compounded a few errors, a couple double bogeys.  So, yeah, a little bit of everything.  Most the driver.  Some with my technique was a little bit off today.
Q. Just your feel about the fact that three of your peers were able to get into the weekend.  It's never happened in the 20 year -- when we had the 20 designated qualifier, but the last time we had more than this or equal was 2004.  So it speaks for a little bit, you know, more and more progression and talent depth, maybe, of the guys that are playing here.
MARTY JERTSON: I totally agree.  Yeah.  Just the talent that is in our national championship is getting better and better.  I totally agree that was the case.  And I think especially Rob and myself have -- and Ryan has a lot of tour and tournament experience.  So I think the three of us are probably a bit more comfortable and not as overwhelmed by having to play on here, on the big stage.
