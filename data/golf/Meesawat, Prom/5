 Q. Prom, top 10 here, all in all, tell us your assessment.   
PROM MEESAWAT:   You know, it's been a great week for me this week.   Finally I finished in the top 10 with a good field.   I have a very good feeling right now to finish top 10 in a good event like this.  
   
 Q.   When you look back on the last four days, what in particular worked really well for you?  
PROM MEESAWAT:   Everything, but especially my putting has been very good, as well.   Otherwise you can't go under par if you don't putt well.   But overall it's very good, especially on this golf course you have to tee off very good, as well.   Very pleased with the way I'm playing right now.   
   
 Q.   You've got some decisions to make about getting an exemption into next week's PGA TOUR event.   What's in your mind right now?  
PROM MEESAWAT:   I haven't decided yet, but I feel excited since a guy told me I get an exemption for next week, so I have to decide if I'm going to go or not.  
   
 Q.   Have you got a visa for America?  
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, I have no worry about a visa, so I'll just decide go or not go.  
   
 Q.   This top 10 pushes you up on the Order of Merit, as well, on the Asian Tour, gives you a chance to challenge for the No.1 title.   Is that something you're going to be thinking about the next few weeks?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   Well, I haven't think about that, but just try to play good this week first, and we'll see, so the results came out very good for this week.   But Cameron Smith playing very good, as well.   Angelo also playing good, so three of us still got a chance to catch David Lipsky.   We have six more tournaments to go, so I will try to be the No.1.
