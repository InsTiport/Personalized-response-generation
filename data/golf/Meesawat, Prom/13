  PROM MEESAWAT:   I had a good start the front nine, and a little bit disappointed with my back nine today.   Putting's not working very good and my tee shot, struggling a bit on the back side, as well.   
So anyway, still okay with my score, 4‑under par.   Hope I will have a good weekend.   
   
 Q.   And the greens, how are they playing, very fast?   What's been the problem?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   It's very fast.   Sometimes when you have uphill putt, you really try to go for it.   Like you pass it, and you have a scary putt to come back, and some holes, very tricky, especially on 18 is really, really quick one.   But anyway, it's good condition this year.   
   
 Q.   You like this course obviously?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   Well, not really, I think I never finish Top‑20.   Even I made the cut and had a good weekend, so maybe this time.   
   
 Q.   What are you going to do now, go practise?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   Just going to work on my putting a little bit.   Just come back and play again tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You started so well.   Did you think you had a good round in you today?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   I started birdie on the first hole, and through seven, I was like 7‑under par.   But, you know, this course, anything can happen if you miss the fairways, because it's very difficult to hit the greens on this course, especially this year, the greens is very quick, very difficult.   
So I just maintain and concentrate with my game plan.   I'll try my best on the weekend.
