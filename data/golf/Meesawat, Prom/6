Q.   Nice way to finish a round to get to 7, huh?
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah.   Anyways, like I told you earlier in the week, every round I was very happy, so I stuck to my goal today, just 2‑under par.
But you know, I made easy bogey on 12 and 13, but anyways, this was a tough hole, you know.   11, 12, 13 is like we call (indiscernible) for this golf course. 
Anyways, it's a good round, minus two today.

Q.   Did you play those holes before the weather suspension or after?
PROM MEESAWAT:   I played 12 before and then 13 after, so it's a bit stiff when you go out again and have to hit a very good drive on 13.   Anyway, I miss it and hit on the green, but it was far back off the green, so I had 3‑putt there.
Well, I very happy to finish with the birdie on the 18.   You know, go out there again after rain, the green is very slow, you know, because it's rain a lot when they suspend it.

Q.   Only about five shots behind the leader right now.   One more day to go.   Would you do anything different tomorrow?
PROM MEESAWAT:   Well, we'll do the same thing that I have been play for three rounds, but hopefully I can go, you know, target a bit lower for‑‑ to try to catch all the guys on the top there.   So anyway, just play with myself and the golf course and enjoy it.

Q.   Would it mean trying to maybe attack a few more pins?
PROM MEESAWAT:   Well, if I got a chance.   I confident on my wedge, so if I got a chance, of course I'm going to go.   And you know, a couple holes, couple par‑5s like hole No. 3 and No. 5 I hit a good drive, so I will go for it.   But like No. 10 and 18, you know, I was like 10 yards behind all those guys, so it's very difficult to carry the bunker and to get home in 2, like No. 10 and 18.
