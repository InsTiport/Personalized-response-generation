  PROM MEESAWAT:   It's an amazing week for me.   I didn't feel any disappointment in the playoff.   I did the best this week, and my best finish on this golf course, as well.   Very happy with my form I'm playing right now.   
Especially hole No. 13 was a good eagle and 16 I just missed the tee shot and had a very tough bunker shot from there.   And I holed a long putt again.   It's a good turning point for me.   
   
 Q.   When you started as you did, having the birdie at the second, and another long putt for eagle, did you think, hey, this could be a good day for me?   
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, at the third hole, 3‑under par, okay, I'm still in a good position to win the tournament and just, you know, still make my game plan, put the ball in the position that I can make birdie.   
   
 Q.   Must have been lovely just walking down 18, knowing that you were in the lead in the championship.   
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, lovely to walk on, especially when I hit the green on the 18th and then making a 2‑putt from there.   But it's unlucky, you know, Miguel making birdie on 17 and the playoff hole.   So I'm pleased with the way I'm playing right now.  
   
 Q.   We sometimes say it's like a penalty shootout, never nice to lose, but when you lose in that fashion, it's not so bad, is it?  
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, it's not feeling bad when you didn't do any mistake and somebody playing better than you.   So it feels very good.   
   
 Q.   And for you, home to Thailand and a big event to come?  
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, heading to Thailand next week.   Hopefully raise the Thai flag for the Thailand Golf Championship next week.
