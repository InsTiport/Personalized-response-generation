Q.   Flawless round of 67 today, you must be quite pleased with how you conducted yourself. 
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, it's a pretty good score for a 67 today, but many players going low.   But very happy with my round.   But still left a bunch of birdies on the course.   Anyway, bogeyâ€‘free, it's very nice form to play. 

Q.   We have seen how this golf course can bite players when you least expect it.   What are your thoughts for the final 18 holes tomorrow? 
PROM MEESAWAT:   Just stick with my game plan, play with the golf course and focus on my game, keep the ball in play and try to put myself in positions as much as I can. 
Been a busy season, and almost the end of the year.   Looking for to win at the end of the year.
