Q.   Talk about the 66 to start here. 
PROM MEESAWAT:   Very happy to start 66 here, it's a tough course.   Playing good today from tee‑to‑green, especially on this course, you must hit in the fairways.   So nothing to complain about 66 today.

Q.   I presume you're very happy with your form at the moment after the last two tournaments. 
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yes, well, my putting is working very good, and I've been playing good for a couple weeks.   And hopefully doing well again this week.

Q.   We do expect low scores here.   Is it harder than other years, the greens a bit harder and faster? 
PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, the greens, especially the greens, it's very good condition and it's very fast.   You know, this year, I think the best condition we've played on this golf course.   It's still a very tough golf course to go low.
