 Q.   How was it?  
    PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, it was pretty good, compared with my body condition this morning.   The winds was a little bit strong and gusty on the back nine.   Like I told you, this golf course, when the pin position for the tournament is going to be very difficult, not much space to put the ball in play.   I hit the ball good today.   I had three birdies from rescue clubs.   That helped me a lot.   But I still missed a bunch of putts for birdie and eagle putt from 10 feet on No.8 that should go in.   But anyways, it was a good start to start the game.  
   
 Q.   Is it difficult to play on a new golf course?  
    PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, of course, especially the green, but it's the first time for everybody, so we have to work on it and do a lot of work on the greens.   Like I said, where the pin is put for the tournament, it's not easy to hit.   Sometimes you miss a wrong spot, then you get in trouble.   You can't get it close with the next shot.   But still, par‑5, reachable, two reachable par‑5s.   It's like, this golf course, the wind picks up, it's going to be really difficult to play.  
   
 Q.   All in all a good start in your tournament here to maybe try and put you in position to‑‑  
    PROM MEESAWAT:   Yeah, right now, the first thing I have to do is just get my back good because I know my game, even though I had a bad back, I hit still iron shots very good.   But I want to get 100 percent now, get better as I can.
