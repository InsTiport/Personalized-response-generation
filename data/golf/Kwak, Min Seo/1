Q.   What was the key to your round today?   How did you play so well out there? 
    MIN SEO KWAK:   I think I hit it straight and putting was really good this week.
    Last week I missed many short putts, but this week I tried to make all the short putt.   With my caddie I practice a lot this week, so it was good putting.

Q.   Then you had that big hole‑out for eagle.   How far was that shot, and what club did you hit into it?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   It was 88‑yard with the slope, then I hit 52‑degree, like quarter swing.
    Then bounced and then it went in.

Q.   Were you able to see it go in?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Yeah.

Q.   What was your reaction to that?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Like this. 

Q.   So you've played on Symetra last year and won a couple times out there.   Does that give you confidence going into tomorrow's final round?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Yes, yes a lot, because I know how to win like in Symetra Tour.   So I'll try to do same thing as here.

Q.   This is obviously a pretty tough golf course. 
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Yes.

Q.   Do you think the tougher golf courses fit your game?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Yes.   I don't hit far or, yeah, so I think narrow fairway, hard green should be better for me to score better.

Q.   What will it take for you tomorrow to have a good round and hopefully come away with a victory?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   I don't understand. 

Q.   What's going to be the key for you to play well tomorrow?
    MIN SEO KWAK:   Fairway, green, and make putt.
