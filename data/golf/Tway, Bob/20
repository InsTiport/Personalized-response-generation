  Q.  Who thought when you joined the Tour you would be in Greensboro in the heat trying to make the first ever playoffs.   
 BOB TWAY:  The two par-5s, it's tough.  It's kind of hard to play all year.  That's probably why I'm here.   
  
  Q.  You started with 141.  You made the cut.  You would assume okay, should be alright but now you're at 145 as it stands at this moment as we speak.   
 BOB TWAY:  You know, just like I said, all year long I've been on the bubble of making cuts and this and that, and so, you know, that's what happens.  I can keep trying.  That's all I can do.   
  
  Q.  I appreciate it.   
 BOB TWAY:  Yes.
