 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BOB TWAY:   You don't win 45 times on the Champions Tour and the Senior Opens he's won, he's just a great player.   And it's just amazing that he can continue to, obviously he's in good shape, and it's just, I think it's a credit to how great he is and a credit to what kind of good shape he's in and a competitor and pretty awesome.   
   
 Q.   Seems like he goes on forever.   
BOB TWAY:   Yeah, that's what I said, he's a competitor.   Hits the ball wonderfully and, it's just so steady, it's just always just a little cut on every shot and it just is a matter of if he makes the putts or not.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your stretch of 7, 8 and 9 with birdies on those holes.   Or it was on your back nines.   
BOB TWAY:   Yeah, I birdied 18, 1, 2 and 3.   So that was a nice thing to have happen, kind of got me over the hump.  
   
 Q.   Was everything clicking for you then?  
BOB TWAY:   Yeah, just make a putt and hit a good shot and sometimes it just happens that way.
