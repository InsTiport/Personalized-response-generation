  Q. Talk about the birdie putt on 16.   
 BOB TWAY: You know, I do better when it's like a hard chip. When it's an easy chip -- (inaudible) -- you could take all of them closer than that.   
  
  Q. This has been a great couple of weeks for you.   
 BOB TWAY: It's nice to be up there. You know, we've played a lot of golf together.   
 I played some really good golf this week, and any time you shoot 12-under on the weekend, anything can happen.   
  
  Q. You have to feel like 7-under puts you in good position.   
 BOB TWAY: It's kind of in the back of your mind -- (inaudible) -- we're just happy to shoot a good round.   
  
  Q. It's been a while since you had a Top-10.   
 BOB TWAY: Best tournament in a while, and I don't know, I think a lot of it has to do -- I'm not playing that much. I'm I still practice a lot but I think being around the TOUR, you talk about golf a lot and you think about golf a lot.   
 I think if you can have the same attitude that you can have as a caddie as a player, it can help, and so a good attitude can help you.   
 If you keep giving yourself opportunities, you're going to make some. I had a nice up-and-down on No. 15 for par, but other than that -- I think that's the key is to really give yourself opportunities. There's a lot of birdies to be made out there. After this, I'm playing in the John Deere.
