Q.   Overall thoughts?   The course played pretty well for you. 
BOB TWAY:   Well, yeah.   We started off, it was obviously cool and it was playing pretty hard.   Then it warmed up, which was nice.   But I was pleased with how I played.

Q.   Back‑to‑back birdies to end your front nine.   Mix a bogey in here or there.   What did you have going for 8 and 9?
BOB TWAY:   Well, I just hit a good shot at 8 and made a nice short putt. 
And then 9 I hit another good third shot and made a good putt.   So a lot of times you can hit good shots and not turn out so good, but you get them in the bowls then it's good.

Q.   Thoughts going into tomorrow?
BOB TWAY:   Play as good as I can.
