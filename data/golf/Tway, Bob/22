Q.  Obviously 5-under par today, with the format you have to be happy with your score?

BOB TWAY:  You know, you're never happy when you finish.  We left some out there.  I missed some putts.  It was a tough format.  It's a lot of fun, but it's tough.
Q.  You speak of having fun, but do you feel like every shot is so critical and you don't want to put your partner in a bad situation?

BOB TWAY:  Well, that's for sure.  I told Scott, I said, "You hit it anywhere you want to."  Usually he hits it in the fairway, but even if he doesn't, I feel comfortable anyway.
Q.  Scott, obviously you feel the pressure, also but you have to have the attitude, "I can't worry about that, I have to play my own game"?

SCOTT VERPLANK:  Yeah, there's no question.  And it's the same for me.  My game is I try to hit the ball in the fairway and I hit far enough that I don't smash it down the rough all the time.  The front nine we started off real shaky, and neither of us were hitting it very good and actually made a couple bogeys.  And then we kind of found our rhythm.  I got lucky on 9, kind of a swirly shot and it rolled up there along the water and Bob did the great American thing to do and hit it in.

From that point on we started hitting a lot of solid shots.  I started driving it in the fairway.  He was hitting it in the fairway and other than just a couple little short putts, we had a real chance.
Q.  So you got the familiarize over this week, had a chance to enjoy the city at all?

SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well unfortunately, we haven't done much touristy things because we're playing golf but that's the way it always is.
