 Q.   Talk about your round.   I know you had six birdies and can you talk about the four in a row that you had, 11, 12, 13, 14?  
BOB TWAY:   I, they had the tee way up on 11 and I hit a 6‑iron off the tee and a sand wedge close.   
Then I made a good putt at No. 12.   About 20‑footer.   
Then I hit next two shots real close.   I hit it up three feet on 13 and three feet on 14.   So all of a sudden I had four in a row.   
So I played real steady the rest of the time, I actually had a lot of birdie opportunities on the front.   And I got to the 6th hole and really didn't hit that bad of a shot, I just pushed it a hair and it caught on the bank and rolled down in the water.   And being a yellow hazard you got to go back behind it, so I made double there.   But I made a real nice putt on 7 and birdied 8.   So at least I get to play some more.  
   
 Q.   You got to be pretty happy that you jumped back on right side of the cut?  
BOB TWAY:   Yeah, yeah.   So that was good.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts going into tomorrow and the for the rest of the weekend?  
BOB TWAY:   Well, we'll just see.   
   
 Q.   You're 1‑over.   
BOB TWAY:   I'll just see what I can do.
