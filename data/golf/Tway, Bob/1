 Q.   What is your verdict on the third round here?  
BOB TWAY:   Actually I played very nicely today.   I was very pleased with how I played.  
Hit the ball well, made a few putts, so it was a good day.  
   
 Q.   The eagle was nice, came at the right time?  
BOB TWAY:   Yeah, I hit a wonderful drive and had a good approach in there and actually capitalized by making it, so that was fun.   It's always fun to play with Tom, especially watching him play on a links course because he maneuvers the ball so well.   It's neat to see.  
   
 Q.   I think just about every one of us admire him.   I take it you do playing alongside?  
BOB TWAY:   No doubt about it.   It's always a pleasure to play with him, especially over here because you kind of see why he has done so well.   He hits a lot more runner shots downwind, and then into the wind he'll fly it all the way back there.   So it's much more of a variety than what I do.  
   
 Q.   You don't end up second guessing yourself, though, as a result, do you?  
BOB TWAY:   Well, no.   I mean I think that's why he's done so well over here.   You know, if it had been 30 years ago and I watched him do it, I may change, but I'm not changing at 55.  
   
 Q.   You're clearly in a lovely position on that leaderboard, but I know we said this yesterday, but that leader is so far ahead.   Does it change your attitude, your approach or anything?  
BOB TWAY:   No.   I think you just gotta keep playing the golf course like we spoke yesterday as it is.   You gotta lay up to the bunkers and try to play the parâ€‘5s really well.  
   
 Q.   And I think if the wind blows a bit more and changes things.   
BOB TWAY:   I think it's supposed to blow tomorrow.   I think it's supposed to be a lot more challenging golf course tomorrow.
