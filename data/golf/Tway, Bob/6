Q. We were just talking about home course advantage.  Course is different, winds different, everything else kind of takes that away, doesn't it?BOB TWAY: Well, I don't know.  You still know the golf course.  You know, it was a difficult day.  It felt like a U.S. Open. You know, we don't play the golf course when it's in conditions like this, and when the wind starts blowing like this we go inside and have ice tea. It was a very strange wind.  We don't get that many easterly winds.  It did the same thing in the PGA in '88 but not quite this hard. The golf course plays strange.  It's usually just a south wind and a north wind. But, you know, the golf course is fantastic.  It's hard, but it's fantastic.Q. How fun is it to still have a championship on your home course?BOB TWAY: You know what?  It's fantastic.  I'm just so pleased that it turned out to be in the shape that it's in.  You know, a lot of people have worked really, really hard.  Everybody is very proud of this place. That's why we all have continued to live here.  We love it.  Played a lot of golf here and had a lot of good times here and will continue to do that.  It's just a special place.Q. Was there any extra, not pressure, but maybe that's the right word?BOB TWAY: No doubt about it.  You want to play well and you expect to play well.  You know the golf course, but you've got to go ahead and execute. Like I say, it was a difficult day.  You could have been playing really well and still not going to break par today.  It's just a tough day to play golf.Q. Talk a little bit about the round Dr. Gil had.BOB TWAY: Doc always hits it great.  Few more putts in and he would be under par.  One of the best ball strikers I've ever seen in my life.
