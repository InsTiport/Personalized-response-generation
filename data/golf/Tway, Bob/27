Q.   Doesn't look like anybody's running away with this thing yet.  You kept yourself right in the middle of it.  Talk about your round today.

BOB TWAY:  Well, they still have some holes to go.  It's not playing easy, but it's not playing real, real hard.  So if only they don't go too deep it will be fine.


Q.   How would you compare today to yesterday?

BOB TWAY:   I played a little bit better today than I did yesterday.  The wind was pretty much the same.  The same wind direction.  We had a wide variety of pins.  So if you drive the ball in the fairway the greens are pretty receptive to hit the right club.  And the golf course is in good shape.  So there's a chance that you can shoot a good score, but you've got to start well.


Q.   Do you anticipate it being pretty much the same tomorrow as Sunday?  I don't think the conditions are going to change that much. 

BOB TWAY:   I don't think so.  I think the weather's going to stay cool and I think for the time being we're still going to have the north wind, maybe northeast.  But it's totally different than how we usually -- how we played the practice rounds.  But guys are getting used to it now.
