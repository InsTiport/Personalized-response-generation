 Q. No rain. Got it in?
 BOB TWAY: Yeah. It rained on the very first hole, and that was it. So that was nice. Actually, I played very well. I liked the way I hit the ball. Only missed one green. So that was good. So that was okay.

 Q. Any highlights out there, or did it play any different than the practice rounds?
 BOB TWAY: Played totally opposite because of the wind. The wind was out of the north today. It has been kind of out of the south. So it was a little bit different golf course. It wasn't blowing real hard. So it wasn't that big a deal.
 But the holes were pretty much opposite. 

 Q. And obviously good position with 4-under as the lead. Just go out and try and duplicate it and make a few more putts?
 BOB TWAY: Just gotta go out and play well. Out here you've got to put the ball in the fairway. 
 You can't play from the other stuff. If you do that, the greens are soft, so you should hit a lot of greens and give yourself some chances.

 Q. The greens, to me, they look flat but they've got a lot of subtleties?
 BOB TWAY: A lot of subtleties. No doubt about it. They're tough to read. They really are.
