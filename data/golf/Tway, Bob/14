  Q. How did it go for you?  
 BOB TWAY: I shot a couple under. I played good at times and not so good at times.   
  
  Q. How did the course play today compared to yesterday?  
 BOB TWAY: Well we played the ninth and then we played eight holes yesterday and the wind was blowing pretty good.   
 And I kind of felt when we came out this morning it was going to be kind of an advantage. But it really was very cold and a little bit misty and I thought it played a little bit tougher.   
 And then this afternoon it played easier. It warmed up a little bit and then the wind wasn't blowing too much, the ball started going a little bit further and I think you saw some better scores this afternoon.   
  
  Q. Speaking of scores, 7-under is the lead, how do you feel about that?  
 BOB TWAY: Well, you know, I don't know what the other shift's going to do. I definitely don't think anyone's going to go too crazy.   
 You have to play well out there. If you hit it in the rough it's very difficult. And even in the fairways everything is just so wet it's just seems like it's tough to hit really very good shots. But some guys are playing well, you just got to keep plugging along.
