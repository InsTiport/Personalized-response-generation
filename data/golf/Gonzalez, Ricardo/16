Q. Tell us about the day because you are still smiling?

A. Yes I am still smiling. It was a bit like yesterday my round today actually, I hit the driver well and that was the reason that I was again able to shoot 68. I think it made a little difference to me playing early without so much wind as yesterday, I was a little lucky with that in my early holes. But it was really perfect conditions today. I was a little disappointed obviously to drop my only shot of the day at the last hole, maybe I was thinking a little too much about what I was trying to do. I tried to find the fairway but I didn't do that and it is difficult from there. I played out but then missed the green with my third shot and chipped on and two putted.
Q. Why were you thinking too much, was it because of your position on the leaderboard?

A. Yes I think it might have been. I should really have just tried to forget where I was in the tournament and just concentrate on the hole I am playing and I will have to try and do that throughout my whole round tomorrow.
Q. When was the last time you were in this position going into the weekend?

A. Oh, I can't remember, a long time ago, maybe two years. But I will try and play some relaxed golf tomorrow and hopefully that will be good enough to keep me at the top of the leaderboard.
