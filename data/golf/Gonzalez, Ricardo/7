 Q.   65, 65, 70 today, what was the difference today compared to the first two days?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I think the first two days, I hit very well from the fairway to the flag.   Also, I'm happy because make 2‑under par on that course, and that's why I'm feeling good.   
   
 Q.   What happened on the last hole?   We saw a replay of your ball, hit a stone and went right up in the air.   Did you see that?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I see this, but I concentrate to the middle of the green, and try to play safe.   Unlucky because if the stone was not there, I think it's short and very close to the hole.  
   
 Q.   Where did you start your golf?   You have a very natural swing; did you have many lessons when you were young?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   No, not many.   I think all the Argentinians have a natural swing, and improve here on the Tour and see some play and try to copy same swing, that's all, and then it's natural.  
   
 Q.   Do you think tomorrow 20‑under would be good enough to win around here?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I think 20‑under, 21‑under.   
   
 Q.   So a top player like yourself, what do you do right now to bed time?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Try to eat something because I'm very hungry, and then do the same as every day, I go to the restaurant with friends and enjoy the night and then come tomorrow in good form.
