   RICARDO GONZALEZ:  Good work. I didn't hit my driver so good but worked for every shot and that's why I shot 67. It was a perfect day out there, especially this morning, with no wind. I'm very happy.   
  
  Q.  It is a good time for Argentine golfers at the moment?   
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  It is. Angel, than last week Andres and maybe this week Gonzalez.   
  
  Q.  What did you think of the performance of Andres at Carnoustie?   
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  Andres has power golf and I am not surprised. He needs more experience as bogey, bogey and he could have won The Open.  Maybe some experienced player would not have made that decision on the 17th and missed the shot on the 18th. But very happy as Romero is one of the Argentinian stars. That is very good.   
  
  Q.  What did Angel's win in the US Open do for the Argentine golfers?   
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  Opened the mind. You can do anything as Angel did in the US Open. Now for all the Argentinian it makes it easier. If Angel can do it, why not Gonzaelz or Romero or Canete or Vanscik. It is  very good for Argentina.
