 Q.  What was good today? 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  Pretty much everything. I hit a lot of fairways and greens but I was a little disappointed with my putting to be honest. The first two days I made 25 or 26 putts but today it was 29 and I am very happy. So it might have even been a little better considering I three putted two greens as well. But I am happy especially as the conditions as getting harder. With the wind getting up the 12th, 14th, the 16th and 17th are very hard holes now. I know I hit the ball a long way but even that is difficult when it is like this because I have to take care and not hit the ball too far especially with the wind behind me. 

 Q.  But you didn't do that on the 16th!? 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  No that's right. I thought it was right to have a go for the green there with my drive and it came off perfectly. The ball finished about 12 feet from the hole and I holed that for an eagle two. You do not get many of those so that was really pleasing. 

 Q.  You are a very consistent player and on leaderboards all the time, is this the week where you are going to step up to win again? 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  I hope so because I am feeling good. Cabrera's win has opened my mind and it says to me that I can do the same. I will certainly try my best for tomorrow and you never know. 

 Q.  How has Argentina taken Angel's victory? 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ:  The whole country is very happy about it. It is a big win after waiting 40 years for an Argentine player to win a Major Championship and we feel that his win has given a great chance for every Argentine player, not just the young ones, to follow in his footsteps and win tournaments. We see if it is possible for him then it can be possible for us too. Not necessarily a big tournament like the US Open but just normal tournaments too, after his win, we are starting to think that we can win too.
