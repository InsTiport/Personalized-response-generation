Q. Good round, tell us about today?
RICARDO GONZALEZ: Today I played great, my driver was very good, only missed a couple of fairways. I made some putts, I missed some putts but I am very happy. The course is wonderful, it has good design and the fairways and greens are in good condition. But when you play good, everything is good. The wind was tough today so 68 was a good score and I will try to do the same tomorrow. I start early tomorrow and hopefully if I can get lucky with my tee time I can do well.
Q. How was Christmas for you?
RICARDO GONZALEZ: Very good. I had a very long break and spent it with my family which was very nice. It was a good time to recharge my batteries for the season and I will try and use that this week.
Q. What is coming up for you?
RICARDO GONZALEZ: I am on to Qatar and Dubai, and then Portugal and then Madrid and the rest of Europe. I have mapped out the season and it looks good for me.
