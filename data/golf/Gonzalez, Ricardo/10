 Q.   Ricardo, how do you feel here at the Home of Golf at St. Andrews, coming back after a great victory in Buenos Aires?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I'm feeling very good because I win in Argentina, the 75th year on the PGA Argentina, and I make a good score.   Coming here a lot of confidence and that's why I make today 63.  
   
 Q.   Seeing your name on the trophy, where we can find a whole bunch of big Argentinian names‑‑  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Unbelievable.   Roberto De Vincenzo, Fidel de Luca, Florentino Molina, Vicente Fernandez, Eduardo Romero, Andres Romero, and I'm the last.   I'm very happy to be on the trophy.   
   
 Q.   You started off at Carnoustie, 1‑under par, a very solid start, not easy course to play at.   How do you feel?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I feel very good because I'm starting one of the difficult courses is Carnoustie.   I make 3‑under on the back nine and 2‑over on the front nine.   And then played also not easy Kingsbarns because it's windy yesterday and I make a good 72.   And coming to here and say, I need to make 5‑ or 6‑under to make the cut and I make 9‑under; it's amazing.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to shoot a 9‑under par 63 on the Old Course?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I feel one of the‑‑ I don't want to say‑‑ lucky players to break the score, St. Andrews, the Home of Golf, I think any professional when make that score on that course make very, very happy.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel after having played good golf for three rounds, being at 10‑under par, a good result but still being ten shots behind the leader.   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, it's amazing but that's golf, like that.   I'm not saying lucky, but he had the better draw, and he started Kingsbarns and then St. Andrews and then Carnoustie.   But, okay, I'm happy to make 10‑under.   
   
 Q.   What's the plan going to be for tomorrow?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Same as today, make all the putts.   That's the key to make the good score.
