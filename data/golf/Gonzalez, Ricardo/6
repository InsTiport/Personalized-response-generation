 Q. 9‑under par round here at Kingsbarns, what was the secret to your game today?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Always the putter is my secret, but also my family is coming this week and I try to show to my boys and say that round is for him.   
   
 Q.   Is it also the atmosphere here in Scotland that makes you play so well?   You played very well just four weeks ago, and people seem to like you very much.   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, I like the links course.   I'm very happy because I make a 7‑under in St. Andrews, I'm 9‑under here, and I try to keep same for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What is the plan going to be for tomorrow?   Will it be a revenge to get a victory you didn't get four weeks ago playing at Gleneagles?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I like to take that revenge, and why not in the Home of Golf in St. Andrews, make a good round and take that trophy.
