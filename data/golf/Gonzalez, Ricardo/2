 Q.   Tell me how good a round that was.  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah.   I think it's one of the best rounds of this year, and that's why I'm very happy now.   To make 65 on that wonderful course, with my son on the bag, that's great.  
   
 Q.   Inspired by last night?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah.   You feeling my voice a little.   Enjoyed the match, and maybe this the key to play well, to relax and enjoy the day.  
   
 Q.   So you got to watch everything, and you still had enough time to sleep and get up and play and prepare?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes.   Yeah.   I watched it with friends and enjoyed the night.   
And now I'll enjoy the day.  
   
 Q.   Well, there was a spell in the day there when you had three birdies in a row, took a little break and then you had two more birdies and an eagle.   Everything was just working so well.  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah.   I think today my putt working very good, and that I think is the key to make 6‑under on that course.  
   
 Q.   How do you fancy playing links golf?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I like it much.   I like St. Andrews.   I like Carnoustie, and here, I don't know, I tried to make a good score, and that's it.  
   
 Q.   How does Royal Aberdeen compare to those other great courses?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I think it's one of the best because it's very narrow and windy, and I think it's more difficult from the tee.   The other courses are more open, and this is not like that.  
   
 Q.   And you did mention your son being on your bag.   That's pretty special, isn't it?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, it is.   Especially today I make 6‑under, first good round in four weeks, and I think he's very pleased to carry my bag.  
One time I make a good round, like today, and also hit good shots from the tee and good shots to the flag and make some putts.   That's very important on the golf course.  
   
 Q.   Did you step out on the golf course this morning inspired by your national fÃºtbol team's performance last night?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes.   Everybody joke about the Argentinians.   I think it may be make more relaxing to play and do my best, and I think today I did that.  
   
 Q.   And what do you think come Sunday night of an Argentinian double, Argentina couple the World Cup and you winning the Scottish Open?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   It's amazing.   It's my dream.   I would like Argentina to win the World Cup, and also if you can win here, it's altogether.  
   
 Q.   How do you build on this, Ricardo?   How confident are you that you can stay at the top of the leaderboard?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Today I hit good.   That's the key to make good score and then make more confidence.   And then also say before I make I think three or four good putts for six or seven, and I make more relax, and I make that good score.
