Q.   I presume that you're a happy man, you started superbly well and carried it on?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I'm very happy because I hit well from all the course, good driver to the flag and make some putts. 

Q.   And right from the start, four birdies on the first five holes?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, the first four and then the back nine, start on 10,11 and 12, and happy to make 6‑under on that fabulous course.

Q.   How does this compare to how you've played here in Abu Dhabi in the past?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I think this year is more difficult, because the rough, thick rough, and if you miss the shot, you can't get to the green. 

Q.   I guess your length is a nice advantage around this course? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, power, I have power, and see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   It is the first event of the year for you, so what were your expectations coming in? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Play like today and see what happens. 

Q.   How was winter how was your break? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Played golf nonstop.   Played in Argentina, five tournaments, and after South Africa, I need vacation. 

Q.   So no break; is that because you feel duty‑bound, you want to play at home, as well? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, I want to promote the golf in Argentina and South America and play. 

Q.   Which means there's no rustiness compared to everybody else. 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Okay.
