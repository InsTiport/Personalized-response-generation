  RICARDO GONZALEZ:   It's very good, because the third round and the last tournament for The Race to Dubai, and feeling great for me. 

Q.   And did you feel that there were so many opportunities, because we've seen so many chances at birdies being made?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I miss three or four good chance, but still there, and make 6‑under, and hit well, that's the key for me, a good round. 

Q.   You mentioned Race to Dubai.   Are you fully aware what you need to do to book a place next week?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, yes.   I start on the 10, and had a little pressure to think on The Race to Dubai, and then when I made bogey, said, come on, hit shot by shot, and I do that, 6‑under, I'm very happy.

Q.   I'm sure every week you want to win, but now that the mark is there, you've got to finish, say, Top‑30, do you think more about that?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I don't know, I try to think shot by shot, and see what happens in the end of the week. 

Q.   Lovely to get your round finished, isn't it? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, because I can sleep two more hours.   That's good for the finish.
