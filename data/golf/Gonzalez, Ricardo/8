 Q.   Where has the form come from?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I don't know, I think the five weeks of rest, charge my battery and that's all.  
   
 Q.   So when you have five weeks' holiday, no practise, or lots of practise?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Practise every day.   I play 18 every day.   It's very cold in Argentina, but practicer day.  
   
 Q.   You're an Argentine, I guess you like eating stake?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What do you make of Scottish food?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Very good.  
   
 Q.   What about the weekend, you must be very excited because this is now an important week for you?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, important, because I not play good the start of the season, and I try to do the same thing, make putter and hit well like the last two days.  
   
 Q.   Is the course good for a big, strong boy?   Is it good?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   It's good for me.   It's good for longer hitter, but straight, that is very important.  
  
 Q.   Shooting two low rounds back‑to‑back, it hasn't happened for while?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, two rounds, 65, I don't think I ever do that.   I'm feeling good, I play good today, and like yesterday, I hit very good tee shot and especially very good I shot to the flag and also great putting makes it 26 and today is 26 or 27 putters, that's for a good score.   
  
 Q.   Where has this come from?   Have you felt that it's been getting better?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   The rest, five weeks' rest I think helped a lot.   
I changed my grip on Tuesday and I'm feeling good like that, and I think that's the key to hit well these first two days.  
  
 Q.   When you said yesterday that the weather was helping you focus your mind, as well, that it wasn't the sunshine, but you had to concentrate that much more, same again?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I play better with no sun.   Maybe.   Maybe.   You never know.   I think the key is the putter.
