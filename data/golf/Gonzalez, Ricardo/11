 Q.   Ricardo?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   It was great.   It was a long time I make a 64, and especially in a tournament.   When I'm feeling very good, it's always my putter.   That's the important thing.   
   
 Q.   The difference today, you say it's been a long time since you had a round like this; why has it happened today?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Because I made the putts.   I make 27 putts today.   When the ball is going in, more relaxing for the player.   
   
 Q.   You're on top of the leaderboard just now; do you think you can stay there until Sunday night?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I'll try.   I'll try to do my best and try to keep the feeling over the greens and see what happens.
