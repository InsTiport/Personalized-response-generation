Q.   Your thoughts on shooting 7‑under to start this championship? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, I'm feeling good because my first round this year ‑‑ and played very good from the tee, could make some good putts, and that's why it's good. 

Q.   And all this after a bogey at your first hole?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I hit bad 5‑wood, and then good bogey.   Then bad bogey on the first hole, hit good drive and then the ball is in a great up‑and‑down.   But you need that when you hit a bad shot and that's what happened. 

Q.   You'd better tell me about one of the really good shots, the eagle that came? 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, driver and good 4‑iron and then maybe ten feet to the hole and then make. 

Q.   How do you like Gleneagles?   You've come here plenty of times?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I like it‑‑ I like the course.   That's the key for a good round, enjoy the people and enjoy. 
I think the weather opened my eyes and take more concentration on my putter and my driver.   I think tomorrow, maybe not close. 

Q.   Must be nice to be leading a tournament, has not happened for a little while. 
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, long time ago.   I don't know, it's good to start with the right foot and maybe in the end of the week, it's good.
