  RICARDO GONZALEZ:   I played great today.   I made some good putts.   That's why I make 67.  
   
 Q.   You played well on the first day with so many pars and just held it together?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I played‑‑ after 13 holes, I played solid.   I miss just a little putt, and then double‑bogey on 14 and then birdied 15 to come to finish 1‑over.   
   
 Q.   Did that mean that you came into the second day still feeling good and thinking you could impact on that leaderboard?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes, yes, I hit good and feeling confident, and don't know what happens tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of the course?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Very good, very tough and with that wind, very long course.   Difficult, just like that.   
   
 Q.   Does it help you that it is long; that you've got that length off the tee?   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, but some holes, I need to hit 4‑iron or 3‑iron to the hole or to the green, and I think it's difficult for everybody.
