 Q. Tell me about the final round that begins with seven and seven birdies?
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: I started a little cold on the first hole, missed my driver in the bunker and today, I needed a good score. Maybe I had a bad decision from the bunker. I thought I could put the ball on the green but hit it and it comeback to me. Then you have two in the bunker and I need to place -- maybe it's not my day. 
 But then when I made the birdie on the second hole, and I said to my caddie, come on, you can do it, you can make more birdies and stay in the tournament.

 Q. Two or three more birdies; but you made seven more birdies, which makes for a terrific final score. 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Yeah, and I changed my putter today. I have the belly, and I'm feeling good with that change.

 Q. So you do feel that that is an improvement; you felt problems with the previous putter? 
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Not problems. I think the greens are a little bumpy and my belly putter is a little -- not have a loft and this one has two or three degrees loft and helps a lot in that wind. 

 Q. Were you ever thinking today you've got a chance at victory or was Noren just too far ahead?
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Yes, I think he's 10-under now. You never know, it's very tough final holes, I wait here, and see what happens. 

 Q. Finding form?
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Yes. 

 Q. You were good at Wentworth to close and good here?
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: I played good the last months in Argentina. So I'm here to try to put the ball in the fairway and make more solid putts, and be in position and that's the key for good play here.
