  Q. What was good for you today?  
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Today I played really good the first 12 holes and then it was a bit of a struggle to be honest, I missed a couple of drives and left myself a lot of long putts which meant I didn't really have very many chances for birdies. I think it's fair to say that the wind picked up a little bit on the back nine which changed the way a few of the holes played, but I am very happy with a 66.  
  
  Q. Is this the best you have played here?  
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: I think it is. I believe my previous best score was 67 so to take one shot off that is pretty pleasing. I love it here though, especially with this weather, it is perfect. I really enjoy St Andrews. Before the Open here in July I just spent some time walking around the course and the town because it is a really special place with a really special atmosphere. I have my family here again with me this week as I did in July so I am enjoying myself.  
  
  Q. Is this a relaxed tournament for you with the amateurs?  
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: Very much so and I really enjoy playing with them, especially today as I played with the former Argentina rugby captain Hugo Porta who is a sporting legend back home so it was a pleasure to play with him. He is a great man, not such a great golfer! But we had fun. We talked about everything, golf, rugby, tennis, everything.  
  
  Q. We haven't seen you on a leaderboard for a little while?  
 RICARDO GONZALEZ: This year my problems have been on the greens to be honest. Today I only had 26 putts which made all the difference. I did a lot of work on my putting last week at home and I think it has paid off - I just hope I can keep it going.
