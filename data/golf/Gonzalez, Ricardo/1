 Q.   So what is your take on a long day out there, but a good one?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah.   I played seven yesterday, good from the tee, made some good putting.   
Unlucky on 18 because I didn't have a good lie and tried to reach the green in two, but mistake.   
And that's it.   I'm happy because I played good 17 holes.  
   
 Q.   Well, you're smiling.   That was horrible after all that had gone before.   You played so well.   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, just focus like that, and I need to sometime stay patient and play safe.   Of course, that didn't happen on 18.   I did not do that.   
That's okay, but I'm very happy because I hit good and made good score.  
   
 Q.   Out difficult was it out there today because it was different than the first day?  
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yeah, yeah.   I think the wind changed, and the first nine holes is all downwind and play idle from the tee and especially the par‑5, and make more easy, you know.   
But Back 9 hit driver, 3‑wood and 4‑iron.   I think the only play is try to save the Back 9.  
   
 Q.   Is there something special about playing in Scotland?   You always seem to do pretty well.   
RICARDO GONZALEZ:   Yes.   I like it.   I said yesterday I like the Scottish, the Scottish man and the people support today, almost 40, 50 persons follow me in the last group, and that's I am feeling comfortable.
