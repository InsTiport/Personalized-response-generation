CARNOUSTIE, 68,  (-7)
Q. A fantastic round today in tough conditions?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:  I think I played my best golf. I hit six or seven Scottish shots -- low shots -- and made some putts. I really enjoyed it.
Q. You have come into some good form of late with tied 10th at the Linde German Masters and tied 11th at the BMW International Open. Are you happy with your game?
RICARDO GONZALEZ:  My game is coming and I will try this week to win. Today I enjoyed it. I hit a lot of perfect low shots and putted well.
Q. And your thoughts for the weekend?
RICARDO GONZALEZ: It will be difficult but I shall try to catch Monty.
