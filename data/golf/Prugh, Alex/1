 Q.   Alex, back-to-back rounds in 60.   Got to be pleased with the way the back ended up today.  
ALEX PRUGH:   Definitely.   Fortunately I started my day off with a nice little like 25, 30-footer.   It's always good to get the first birdie of the day, and I was a little disappointed with my two bogies today because I hadn't made a bogey yesterday or anything like that.   Had to drop it on 18 after I put it in the water.   But other than that, you know, hit a couple good wedge shots close and made a couple long putts.  
   
 Q.   To follow up with a good round like you had yesterday, how much of an advantage is it to get back on the golf course like you're able to do first thing this morning?  
ALEX PRUGH:   Ton of an advantage.   Fortunately left the course yesterday seeing good shots.   It's a quick turnaround.   And as long as you are feeling it right, you can take advantage of kind of keep on rolling, and I felt like I did that.  
   
 Q.   You hit a lot of greens through 36 holes.   How key is it to give yourself as many putts as good as these greens are?  
ALEX PRUGH:   It's very key.   Other than putting a couple close ones, I hit a lot of putts today that looked like they were going in, and if not, they would go in, and I'm just trying to keep it simple off the tee so I can get it on the green.   Might not be close, might not be 5, 6 feet, might be 20, 30 feet.   The greens are good.   Get it on line, it's going to go in.  
   
 Q.   Good playing.  
ALEX PRUGH:   Thanks.
