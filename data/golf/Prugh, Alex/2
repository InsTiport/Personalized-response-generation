 Q.   Talk about your round today.   
ALEX PRUGH:   It was pretty solid round.   I definitely made plenty of birdies, which was nice.   Unfortunately, I started to finish the back nine with a couple bogeys.   But other than that, I didn't really make any long putts for birdies.   It was just good iron shots and such that were to within six or seven feet and made all those, it seemed like.   
So, very happy with my start and hopefully it can get better.
