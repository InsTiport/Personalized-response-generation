  Q. Welcome to THE PLAYERS. Just get your comments on playing here for the first time.   
 ALEX PRUGH: I'm definitely excited. I mean, anybody would argue that it's another major pretty much. Technically not, but you know, big deal, big purse, great golf course, so you can't get much better.  
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about your season up to this point.   
 ALEX PRUGH: I had a great season, just playing golf fortunately, had a great start, which has opened a lot of doors for me early on. This was definitely not in my playbook at the start of the year. I was not even thinking about getting into this but obviously did.   
 I feel great about my start. Fortunately there's still a lot of events left, so the ending goal obviously, I want to get to the Junior Championships.  
  
  Q. Now that you're here, comment a little bit about the golf course and specifically the last three holes.   
 ALEX PRUGH: I think the golf course is great. I mean, fortunately there's some scorable holes and there's some holes you just want to walk away with par. I think the last three holes are great holes. A lot of drama to be had there. 16 is a great risk-reward par-5 that you definitely want to go for, especially with that big tree there right in the fairway. For the third shot you don't want to have to lay up too far behind that. So whenever I get an opportunity to go for it, it's going to be awesome.   
 I don't have a problem with 17. It's only a 100 -- basically a 9-iron. In theory it shouldn't be that hard. But I haven't played it in tournament conditions thus far yet. First couple days I'll probably aim my tee ball more towards the center of the green, just kind of get my feet underneath me there.   
 And then 18 is a great finishing hole, not a whole lot of room for error there.
