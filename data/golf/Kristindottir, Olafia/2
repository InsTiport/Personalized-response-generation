Q. 2- or 3-under today.  Possibly won't make the cut, but how do you feel about your round and the first two days out here?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I was playing way better than what I shot today.  Just hit really stupid shots.  I don't know.  Went too far.
I mean, I'm happy with my game.  Just should've been better.
Q. This was your first LPGA event in the States.  How has it been?  How was that experience?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: It was fun.  There was a lot more people out here, and of course I play with Michelle and Cheyenne so there was a crowd that follows them.
It was a little bit different for me.  I really enjoyed it.  It was really fun to see how excited the people are.
Q. How was it playing with your college teammate, Cheyenne?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I love playing with Cheyenne.  It's so fun.
