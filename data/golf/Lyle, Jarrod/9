  Q. Did the fans say anything beforehand?  
 JARROD LYLE: No, it's just the usual rowdy stuff as you walk up there. But that's my first hole-in-one as a professional. Of all the holes to have a hole-in-one in the world, this is probably the best one that you can think of.  
  
  Q. What did you feel like?  
 JARROD LYLE: I don't know, I probably carried on down there, but it's just one of those things where the crowd spurs you on a little bit, and I was trying to spur the crowd on a little bit, too, to make it as loud as possible. It was just an incredible feeling.  
  
  Q. What did you hit there?  
 JARROD LYLE: I hit an 8-iron. Just short of a good 8-iron, and I guess it's a perfect shot.  
  
  Q. You were begging for it to kind of get down when you hit it. Did you think it was going to be a little long?  
 JARROD LYLE: I thought it was going to fly a little bit too far up there, but when I saw it bounce and then bounce a second time, I thought, this is pretty close, and then it disappeared, and I'm like, holy hell, it's in. So yeah, just carried on and cheered and screamed, and I think I dropped a naughty word up there. But I was just so excited that I didn't realize the camera was about three feet in front of my face and I dropped an F-bomb, so there might be a letter in my locker next week.   
  
  Q. Was it hard to get your composure again on 17?  
 JARROD LYLE: No, it wasn't, because we had a fair wait. The group in front of us was still out there, so there was plenty of time to relax.  
  
  Q. Generally do you like the atmosphere of that hole?  
 JARROD LYLE: You know, I do. I think it's definitely made a name for itself in world golf. You know, it maybe gets a little loud at times, but it's 16 at Phoenix; that's all there is to it.
