Q.   Obviously really impressive round, bogey‑free, 6‑under.   This is a pretty good track to do that on. 
JARROD LYLE:   Yeah, any time you can shoot bogey‑free around any golf course is pretty good.   But this is a golf course that is very, very easy to make bogeys on.   Today was good.   I didn't get myself in any trouble and actually holed some putts, which was nice. 

Q.   I suppose the front nine is where you really made a good move.   Did you feel some momentum there?
JARROD LYLE:   Yeah, obviously.   I hit some really good shots on the front nine and probably left another one or two out there on the front, as well.   Any time you can sort of say that and still shoot 66 is always a good thing.   I'm just looking forward to building on this and having a go on the weekend.

Q.   Obviously you're in a really good spot now, just two back.   How do you approach the weekend now?   This is not an everyday thing for you to be that close. 
JARROD LYLE:   I don't know, it's something that I've‑‑ I haven't really experienced a lot of it, but you know, this year I seem to be getting myself into contention somewhat more often.   I'm just going to get used to it, and I'm not going to change a thing, go out there and do what I do and prepare as good as I can tomorrow morning and get myself ready for tomorrow's round. 

Q.   You had a really good save there on the last.   Is that something that gives you momentum forward?
JARROD LYLE:   Yeah, look, I hit a [bad] chip.   It was a terrible chip.   Got lucky with a good putt there.   Couldn't have left the putt in a worse spot.   But holed the putt and got a good round going, and I kept the good round going at the end there, so it was nice.
