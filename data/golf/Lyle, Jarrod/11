 Q.  Jarrod, you were 6-under on the round today, 10-under posted, six birdies on 2, 4, 8, 9, 15 and 17 and some stats that are indicative of the round you had:  12 of 14 fairways, 14 of 18 greens, 26 putts.  What was the key to your round? 
 JARROD LYLE:  I think just today I got off to a really good start.  I was a couple under through four holes, and just kept giving myself chances.  I've been putting solid all week and it just a matter of for me getting it somewhere on the green to give myself a look at birdie. 
 Today I hit a lot of greens and hit a couple of shots reasonably close and holed a couple of great putts for par.  On 7 I think I holed about a 30-footer for par there, so it was nice to hole that and keep the round going. 

 Q.  Do you think your round was indicative of what it was, just a great round of golf, or is the golf course there for the taking? 
 JARROD LYLE:  To be honest, I think it's a hard course to score on.  I think, you know, the greens are kind of difficult to read.  Some of those flags are in some pretty tough spots, and you start missing greens in the wrong spots and you leave yourself those downhill, downgrain chips out of the rough, and you've pretty much got no chance of getting them up-and-down. 
 That's what I've done this week.  I haven't missed any shots in the wrong spots, and putted solid.  So it's just a matter of going out there and keeping that momentum going.
