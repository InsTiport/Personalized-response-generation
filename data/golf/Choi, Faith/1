 Q.  I know the first day was just an incredible performance that you guys put on.  Birdies were a little tougher to come by on Sunday and today.  Tell us a little bit about the match and how it went.  You seemed to catch a little spark around the turn.  
FAITH CHOI: They kept making long putts.  We weren't really...   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: I mean, it wasn't really clicking for us.   
FAITH CHOI: Yeah.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: We were hitting the ball, hitting most greens, but weren't really dropping for us.  We were playing pretty steady out there.   
FAITH CHOI: We were playing our golf basically.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, they just made more birdies than us.  Yeah, I mean, we played solid today.  Felt good coming into the tournament.  I made two birdies.   
 Q.  9, that must have been 35 feet.  
FAITH CHOI: Yeah, that was a big confidence booster for me going around the turn.   
 Q.  But then did they chip in on 10?  
FAITH CHOI: No, we both par'd.   
 Q.  Okay.  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Seemed like they got it right back?  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, they did.  Yeah, I mean, we try to keep each other up out there.  Try to keep it steady.  Just wasn't dropping for us.   
 Q.  Were there a lot of good looks similar to the other days as well?  You such proximity the first day.  All those birdies within ten or twelve feet.  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, they weren't as close.  I felt like the greens were a little harder today.   
FAITH CHOI: The pins were harder too, definitely.  The winds picked up.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah.  But, I mean, shouldn't be any excuses.  Yeah, I mean, we have to go back, practice a little more, come back next year -- or I probably won't be here, but she'll be here.   
FAITH CHOI: Yeah, I'll be here.   
 Q.  You say you probably won't?  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, because it might conflict with my college schedule.  Yeah, she'll be out here next year with a new partner.   
 Q.  What can you take away?  You obviously shattered the record on Saturday.  First time seeing the golf course for you; second time for you.  That was an amazing debut.  You've got to take some nice consolation in that?  
FAITH CHOI: Yeah, for sure.  A lot of fun memories definitely.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: A lot of memories that we made.   
FAITH CHOI: We had so much fun out here.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, we had fun.  Good experience for the both of us.  Yeah, good experience for me going into regionals and then, yeah, nationals.   
 Q.  Week from today, right?  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah.   
 Q.  What can you say just a little bit more about the sisters that you played against?  They obviously made some great putts.  Tell me a little bit about...  
FAITH CHOI: They're really there for each other for each hole.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: If one made a mistake the other would make par or birdie.  They weren't making too much mistakes out there.   
 Q.  Is that good experience for you as well, not having played this format too much?  
FAITH CHOI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Seeing how people ding-dong a little bit, one picks up the other one.  You folks do that too, but to see it in action it's a pretty good lesson, right?  
FAITH CHOI: Yeah, for sure.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: For sure.  Yeah, we learned a lot from them.  Yeah, we'll take away a lot like...   
FAITH CHOI: From this tournament.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Especially from them because I guess they played like this match before, so they learned a lot.  Just take that away from them.   
FAITH CHOI: Good experience.   
 Q.  And you also take a medal with you, right?  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, that's the upside.  Kind of wanted make a little more of it.   
 Q.  Sure.  I understand that.  Sorry for the disappointment.  Every day is different, right?  
FAITH CHOI: Yeah.   
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, golf is very different every day, so even though we made 12 birdies on the first day, two birdies the next day, very different conditions weather-wise and maybe the greens, everything is different.   
Golf is an unpredictable game.   
 Q.  Stroke to match play is obviously a different beast?  
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA: Yeah, for sure.
