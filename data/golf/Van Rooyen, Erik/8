 Q.  I guess not the outcome you hoped for. Give us your reflections on the day.  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: You know what, I felt better than I did yesterday, and I think it was a lot more going on yesterday. I got off to a really good start again today. 10 and 12 obviously hurt quite bad. You know, I'm not trying to hit it over the green out of that bunker. So that sucks.   
But you know what, I think I played some really good golf the last four days, and I think I can hold my head high.   
 Q.  The great par save at 4 must have given you a bit of momentum.  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Absolutely. A little bit scrappy on 4. On 3 I absolutely flagged it. I thought I hit it really close, and it just went long. Then on 4, really good putt, so a little bit of positive momentum.   
Look, I've been putting great all week. Today I hit some really good shots on the front nine, and I didn't make the putts. And then it hurts when you go double on 10 and bogey on 12 which is just such a short hole. I certainly had my chances, but nothing to cry about.   
 Q.  You must be proud the way you finished off the round.  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Absolutely. I mean, there's still so much to play for. Yes, we all want to win, but at the same time, I'm trying to finish as high as I possibly can, so I'm not going to go lie down after a bogey.   
I think we had a really good finish, gave myself a few good chances coming down the stretch, and my game is in great shape. I'm looking forward to the next one.   
 Q.  How much can you learn from the last two days?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: So much. I love being here. I can't wait to be in this position again.
