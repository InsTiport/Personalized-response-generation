ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Very happy.  This course is tough and it's going to happen.  So that's all right.   
 Q.  Tell us about those greens today.  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: The greens today, I thought they were great.  A few pins were in some tricky spots and you had to hit the right zones on the greens to give yourself a chance.  I thought I did that pretty well.   
15, that could have been better, wrong club for that second shot.  But the rest of the day was great.
