 Q.  Your scorecard apart from 9 looked like a bit of a battle.  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah , it was.  I shanked two shots on the par 5 out of nowhere.  And then I made a couple really nice birdies, as well.  So I just stayed so patient and putted really well today.   
 Q.  How important is it keeping a level head when the golf course is as tough as it is out there?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: It's important, whether it's easy or tough, I think, regardless.  It's a game that's really not going to give you anything.  So on a course like this, even less.  So I think that's very important, yeah.   
 Q.  One of the lowest scores of the day out there, as well.  Take a lot of confidence into the weekend?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Definitely.
