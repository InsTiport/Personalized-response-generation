Q. 1-under today.  Just give us your overall assessment of how things went?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Okay.  Really tough out there.  Especially I guess just mentally, you know, staying in it.  Some of the pins were crazy and it's just that kind of golf course.  You've got to keep it in play, but I'm really happy with that birdie on the last.  Some good momentum going into tomorrow.
Q. Conditions a little bit different, again, to the previous two days.  Did that help with those tough pin positions?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah, it did.  I'm really happy the wind didn't blow today.  It would have been a bit of a challenge out there.  It still was, but yeah, it definitely played a little bit easier.  Hopefully some of the same tomorrow.
Q. Great birdie on the last that now puts you just one behind going into tomorrow.  It's going to be a Sunday shootout.  Is that something you're looking forward to?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Very much so.  Obviously I've already played really well today, very solid.  It's just the kind of course where you've got to kind of just hang around.
I know some of the guys behind us played well today and a couple 4-unders and whatnot.  Tomorrow, it will just be same thing.  You can't push, but hopefully some of the putts drop.
