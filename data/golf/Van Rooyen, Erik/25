ERIK VAN ROOYEN: The 18th was just the cherry on the cake today. I hit it beautifully, tee to green all day, and obviously I holed a few nice putts including one long one on my back nine. Iâm playing very nicely.   
You can be aggressive and go with drivers. For me itâs been a bit of a mix between the two. There are some holes where I really just want to be in the fairway and just lay up short of the bunkers to give myself a shot from the fairway even if itâs far back.   
It was a fantastic first nine, straight out of the blocks, birdie on one and holes a nice bunker shot on six which was great after a poor shot after the tee. I kept it going, calm on the back nine and then nice to finish with two birdies. Iâm a happy man.   
Itâs exciting to lead at a Rolex Series event and leading here too. I havenât played too much links golf, only the Dunhill Links and now this so Iâm fairly new to it but I love it. Itâs going to be a great weekend.
