Q. 1-under for round two.  Give us your overall assessment of how things went today?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Went well.  It's not easy out there.  It's playing really, really tough.  Two-club wind, so it was really just a grind in staying patient and I think it was solid.
Q. Conditions a lot different to yesterday?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Completely different.  Yesterday was almost no breeze and today, like I said, there was a strong wind and it's really sort of tough to judgment on a couple shots, so you've got to be smart out there and just be patient.  Can't push.
Q. You had a couple of good results since graduating from The Challenge Tour last year.  Do you feel like you're finding your feet now on The European Tour?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Definitely.  I feel like I'm playing well.  I'm used to playing The European Tour now.  It's nothing new anymore, so, yeah, I'm good.  I'm comfortable.
Q. Going into moving day, Saturday, what are your thoughts?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: I haven't thought about it yet.  A little tired after round two.  I don't know, I think it all depends on the conditions, if it's like today or if it's like yesterday, will play a huge factor in how the course will play.  We'll take a look at that tonight and figure out a game plan for tomorrow.
