Q. Good playing, even par, low round today so far.  How difficult do you think that will be to replicate for the leaders or even better?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   You've got to -- yeah (laughing), it's Winged Foot; it's playing obviously really hard.  It's cooler.  The ball is not flying quite as far and the wind is up and the greens are starting to get really crusty.  I think someone could go 1- or 2-under, but even par is pretty good.
Q. Talk me through the round, birdies on 4, 10 and 12.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   Yeah, 12 was just a great drive, good 3-wood, front edge, good two-putt.  Pin is in a really tough spot, so it was a nice little two-putt there.
10, probably shot of the day.  I'll be surprised if anyone gets closer to that hole location.  Hit it to about four feet.
4, I made a 30-footer.  Again, quite a tricky pin location right front there.  It's tough to get close.  The wind was a little in off the right, and I hit a high fade 9-iron and it still released about 20 paces.  It's just tough to get close to them.
Q. How much of a factor was the wind today?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   Definitely more so than the first few days, I thought.  So yeah, guys sort of teeing off now, it's going to be fun.
