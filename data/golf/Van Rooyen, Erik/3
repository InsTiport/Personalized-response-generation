  Q. Erik, you're the third man to post a 4-under 68.  What was the secret to yours?
 ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   No secret.  Hit it straight, make some putts.  I don't feel like I putted the best even, so I guess the hitting was on point.
 Q. The golf course today, how did you feel it was?  A lot of guys talked about the difficult pin positions.
 ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   There were.  I do, however, feel like it's playing a tad softer than it has the last two years I've been here, so probably a bit more accessible, but still, it's windy out there.  They were all like three paces from the edge, so it's not easy.
 Q. You had to withdraw from the Masters, which was your first Masters, because of a low back issue, and you haven't played since.  How is it now?
 ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   Pain-free, which is nice.  I haven't been able to practise and play a ton.  It's been rehab, physiotherapy, that kind of stuff.  So the expectation was low coming into the week, but yeah, pleasantly surprised with today.
