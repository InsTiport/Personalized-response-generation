  Q. Thoughts on that final round?
 ERIK Van ROOYEN:   Extremely satisfied.  Happy.  It's been a week where I was a little frustrated throughout sort of Friday and Saturday, and I ended both days with bogeys on 18.  A bunch of 3-putts thrown in there, so I felt like I left a shots on the golf, course and today things kind of came together, which was satisfying.
 Q. Three birdies on the trot, you get a run, and it's scorable.
 ERIK Van ROOYEN:   Yeah, it is.  The holes that I birdied, you know, like 11, I hit a 5-iron in there is, 16 was a 6-iron.  They were still all mid- to long-irons, so you had to hit the ball well.  That wind now on the back nine the guys are playing, it will be tougher.  I don't think there will be too many birdies.  What I'm saying is, I had to strike it well to give myself any chances.
 Q. Doesn't compare to yesterday, does it?
 ERIK Van ROOYEN:   Not at all.  Yesterday was brutal.  I really loved what Tommy said, though.  It's okay for us to once in a while play days like that.  The game stays the same.  Get it in the hole for the least amount of shots, and like Tommy, I quite enjoy that challenge.
