 Q.  Are you ready to win a major right now?  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  I think so.  Of course, I haven't got my first win on the European Tour or the PGA Tour yet.  Personally I feel like it's only a matter of time.  You can't push this sort of thing.   
 There's lots of outside influences.  Someone else that plays great, luck of the draw, that whole kind of thing.  So I know that if I keep doing my thing, that door is going to open.   
 Q.  Really delighted to see those trousers.  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  With these?   
 Q.  I'm going through a midlife crisis so I love them.  I don't think many of my colleagues do.  This is the first time you've worn them?  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  Yeah, I've got a few different colors.  I started wearing them this year.   
 Q.  Why?  What do you like about it?  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  I like the fact that it's a little bit different yet still classy at the same time.  It's not out there and whacky with a bunch of flashy colors and that kind of thing.  But it is different and I like it.   
 Q.  Is it just the style helps your golf?  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  I don't think it helps my golf, but it is comfortable and I like standing out a little bit.   
 Q.  Did you have any remarks from any of the other players or governing bodies?  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  No governing bodies, no.  I'm kind of glad they haven't stepped up and asked me about it.  But I get crack from all the players on Tour all the time, and that's okay.  I can handle it.   
 Q.  One of your playing partners said, Not many people can pull it off, but you probably can.  
 ERIK van ROOYEN:  If you're going to wear it, you've got to own it.  I feel like I'm owning it.
