 Q.  Erik, a 71 today.  How do you feel about your round?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: A little frustrating.  I think I hit the ball really, really well today, and I don't think I putted bad, I just misread a few.  I think I hit it really well, but there's one more round, and we're going to go fight.   
 Q.  What's your mental approach now for tomorrow?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Some of that, I think I just got to go out and make birdies.  I definitely gave myself chances today.  I didn't have a look at the forecast yet tomorrow.  I don't know how windy it's going to be.  Hope it's blowing and go shoot a low one, and we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  You and Zander pretty much had matching scores, 71, 71.  You'll be paired together tomorrow.  How will that be?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: That would be cool.  Zander's a great guy, being a fellow South African, but I'm out there to do my own thing.  Doesn't matter who I play with.  I'll just stick to what I'm doing.   
 Q.  I think currently you're five behind.  Do you think you'll end up -- well, that you have a chance tomorrow?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yes.   
 Q.  And will your strategy be any different tomorrow?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: I don't think so.  I think my game plan's pretty good.  Good mixture of sort of a little more conservative and then also hitting a few drivers.  It's just key to keep it in play, and I gave myself some great chances today.  I think the game plan is just set up for birdie.  So I'll just go do it tomorrow.   
 Q.  And do you take confidence in the fact that you'll be going quite a bit earlier and have a chance to post a number?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Exactly.  Go out, shoot 6, 7, 8 under, whatever, and put some pressure on them.  That would be awesome.
