 Q.  Thoughts on that finish?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: What way, way to finish. I'm obviously bleak about the tee shot I just heat in a playoff, but what a week it's been. I'm really happy I gave myself a chance. That's what we did today. We got off to a hot start. I finished with an eagle on 18 to get in the playoff and that's what you want.   
 Q.  Home next week. Going with lots of positives?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. I have a bunch of family coming. A course that I love back in South Africa. It doesn't really get better than this.
