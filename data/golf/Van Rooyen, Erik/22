 Q.  An opening round 67, no dropped shots.  How pleasing was that on very good scoring conditions out there today?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Pleasing.  I think I left a few out there, but us golfers, we're all pretty greedy.  You're always going to want one or two shots less but very happy.   
 Q.  Overall, you haven't seen much of this golf course but what have you made of the conditions and the course in general?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: It's stunning.  It's a beautiful golf course.  The greens are fantastic.  I think it's pretty fair.  The rough's not exceptionally long, but I think it plays really fair and there's not a breath of wind.  So it's gettable, but there's three days of golf left, so we'll get in.   
 Q.  First full season back on The European Tour.  How much have you enjoyed it, and these three big events to look forward to for the first time at the end of the season?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah, it's been fantastic.  It's been a wonderful season and lots of good results.  Try and finish it strong.   
 Q.  A win in a Rolex Series would cap it off nicely?  
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: It would indeed.
