Q. First time playing the Nedbank Golf Challenge, how much are you looking forward to this week?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Very much.  It's a tournament I've always wanted to play as a kid and came here plenty of times with the family to watch.  It's a privilege to be here.
Q. You've played well on South African soil this year.  How will this course suit you this week?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: I think it will suit me pretty well.  It's a ball-striker's paradise, really.  You have long holes and small greens.  I think that's going to be key this week.
Q. Last week, you started well and finished well and a bit up and down in the middle.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Definitely, a lot up and down throughout the middle but as a whole, so many positives.  I feel like my game is really right on the verge, so we'll just keep moving one step at a time.
Q. In terms of the year, you must take a tremendous amount of confidence the kind of year you've had, your first full year back on Tour.  It's been a fantastic year.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: My first year on The European Tour, a lot golf learning experiences, a lot of great finishes.  So again, we'll just keep doing what we're doing and we're moving in a really good direction.
Q. Gary Player hosts this event.  Have you met him?  What do you make of him as a person?  He's such a great ambassador for South African golf?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: He is a great ambassador.  I haven't met him yet.  I'm sure you'll bump into him sometime this week.  He's so good for golf in general and South African golf, it's great to have him here this week.
