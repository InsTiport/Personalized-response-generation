  Q. What a tough match, you're 5-up, five to play, and Harris English gave you everything you could handle until that nice two-putt par on 17 to close it out 2 & 1.
 ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   Yeah, Harris is a good player, so you can't expect for him to just kind of hand it to you.  Obviously made two bogeys, that was pretty soft, and then he capitalized on 16, so definitely made it more interesting than I would have liked.
 Q. This whole group is a mishmash because everyone has a win, everyone has a loss.  It's going to make for one heck of a Friday out there.
 ERIK VAN ROOYEN:   I love it.  I'm really stoked for tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it.
