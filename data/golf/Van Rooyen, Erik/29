Q. 4-under to start the week.  Give us your overall assessment of how that went.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Obviously really pleased.  I played my front nine extremely well.  Really good tee-to-green, and that made it easy.  I hit the ball really well with my irons and had a lot of short putts, especially my first nine.
Back nine was different.  Missed a couple more fairways and I guess just didn't hit it inside ten feet as much.  But very satisfied.
Q. Conditions seemed pretty much perfect out there.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Absolutely perfect.  It's barely a breeze out there, so it's good scoring conditions.
Q. Couple of bogeys during your round but you bounced back with birdies immediately after.  That must have been pleasing.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Really pleasing.  I guess just a little bit of loss of focus, especially and the par 5, No. 8.  A couple poor shots, but really happy to bounce back with a birdie on 9 and close out the round.
Q. Great tee shot on 9.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Thank you.  Yeah, I'm very pleased.  It's not an easy par 3.
Q. What's the game plan for tomorrow?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Same thing, yeah.  Long way to go.  Keep it in the fairway on this place, you can control the spin coming out of the fairway, which is key to getting it close to some of these pins, so same thing.
