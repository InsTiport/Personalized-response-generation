Q. An opening round 65.  Give us your thoughts on that.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Very consistent.  Hit a lot of fairways, a ton of greens, and obviously rolled in some putts.  Putter is working.
Q. Obviously you came through The Challenge Tour last year, first time in the Rolex Series Events, how are you enjoying things on Tour this year?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Loving it.  It's events like last week and this week makes you realise why we play this game.  It's absolutely fantastic.  Great venue again this week.  Loving every minute of it.
Q. You got off to a fast start and the highlight was the eagle.  Tell us about that?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah, hit driver down the middle and think I had about 2 '01 yards.  Hit 6-iron about six feet.  Rolled it in.  Pretty simple.
Q. First year on Tour, you've had some great results already and put yourself in a nice, strong position and especially with the Rolex Series and extra points, to get those points early is a massive boost, and you can play with a more relaxed attitude.
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Yeah, these tournaments have a lot of weight to them and getting off to a good start is great.  I've got off to a great start this season, so it's nice to play with a bit of freedom.
Q. What pleased you most about the round today?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Just putting.  I've been working hard at it, and it's nice to see them go in.
