Q. After the first round 74, a 69 and a 68, and three birdies to finish on Saturday, how good did that feel?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: Really good.  I'm smiling right now.
Q. What were the keys out there today?  You mixed in five birdies on the back nine.  Did you just go up a gear?  What was that all about?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: I didn't even realise I made five birdies to be honest.  Yeah, I didn't switch any gears.  I struggled with my rhythm, my tempo, but in the beginning, and you know, I think I just kind of found my flow on the back nine, sort of through seven on the front side.
I spoke to Alex, my caddie, just we'll keep doing what we're doing.  I think we were at level par through eight holes and things just started to click.
Q. You've had some lovely performances, certainly in recent tournaments, but you've slept on an overnight lead going into the final round of the Irish last year.  What are the big takeaways from that now?  More maturity?  How you do you see it?
ERIK VAN ROOYEN: I was quite nervous last year and I think I've been in this position a burning of times now.  The nerves will be there again tomorrow, but I love to be in this position.  Look, what we've been doing up until now has been great, to we'll just keep doing that.
