Q.  First of all, Mr. Ford, your thoughts about your round today.
BOB FORD:  Well, disappointment.  I could have saved a better score with some better putting, but at the end of the day I really drove it poorly.
Q.  I understand you're not only the head pro at one course, but at two courses that are world famous.  Tell me, on a typical Thursday afternoon, if you weren't here today playing in the PGA tournament, what would you be doing at your normal job today?
BOB FORD:  Well, that's a good question.  I would be teaching probably about this time of day.
Q.  So certainly a nice change on your part.
BOB FORD:  Yeah.  Well, I enjoy that.  But I enjoy this too.  It's fun.
Q.  What are some things that you hope to fix and have ready to better yourself on the scoreboard tomorrow?
BOB FORD:  Well, I need to go fix my driver and then I need to figure out how to putt.
