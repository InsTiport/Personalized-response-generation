  Q. How is the course playing for you today?  
 BOB FORD: It played nice. They set it up beautifully, I thought. It's another windy day in the afternoon and I just didn't hit it very well.   
  
  Q. What were some of the highlights?  
 BOB FORD: I started nice. I started with a nice birdie at the first par-5 on the back nine. And then birdied the par-3, 17 to get to 1-under. And then I drove it as far off the fairway on 18 and hit a couple more times from there and just ended up making bogey.   
  
  Q. What kind of impact did the wind have today?  
 BOB FORD: Well these guys are good. They put the tees up on the holes and they're all reachable. And I'm sure if I can reach them, everybody can reach them.   
  
  Q. The wind and plus the altitude here, what kind of adjustments do you have to make for that?  
 BOB FORD: Well the altitude is great up here, no question. But the wind may have mitigated that a little bit. But the par-5s played pretty easy and as you can see by the score, 66, a couple of them, those are real good scores.
