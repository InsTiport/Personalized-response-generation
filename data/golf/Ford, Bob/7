Q.
How do you feel about your round today?  I notice that you were pretty consistent overall.  Shooting the same as yesterday.
BOB FORD:  Well, I played better today.  In the last two holes I just couldn't shake in a couple five footers to shoot a better score today.
Q.  Any minor improvements or anything for tomorrow?
BOB FORD:  Well, I hope my putting gets a little better.  I'm a little shaky with the putter.  So that's what I need to improve.
Q.  And how does it feel to make the cut here at the tournament?
BOB FORD:  It's great in your hometown.  My family just got home today from Florida for the school year so I'm anxious to play on the weekend and have them come up and watch.
