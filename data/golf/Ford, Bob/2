  Q. How were the conditions this morning?  
 BOB FORD: They weren't bad. They really weren't. It rained a little on the first or second hole and then after that it was really okay.   
  
  Q. How did your round go?  
 BOB FORD: Well, pretty poorly. I just drove it so bad. Every hole was a par-5 for me. Chipping out and then on with an 8 or 9-iron. So I struggled.   
 And I 3-putted from like five feet on 13 to make an 8.   
 And finished okay. I could have gone for a really bad score, but 78's bad enough, but it could have been a lot worse.   
  
  Q. What will you work on this afternoon to get ready for? Hopefully want it to be sunny tomorrow?  
 BOB FORD: Yeah, I think so. My driving. I got to get in the fairway. You don't hit it in the fairway here, you know, every hole is a par-5.
