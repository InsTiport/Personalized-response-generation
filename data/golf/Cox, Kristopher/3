Q.  We were pulling for you.
KRIS COX:  Thanks a lot.  Tough day out there today.  I didn't hit the ball near as well as I did yesterday, but was able to give myself a chance.  Two unforced errors on the back 9 really kind of did me in, and Jeff obviously played an awesome back 9.  It was nice to have a chance.  I'm pleased with the tournament.
Q.  Were you aware of the leaderboard and how everybody was packed in, five guys tied at one point?
KRIS COX:  I wasn't until 11 when I looked on the big screen.  That was pretty cool.  I kind of wish I wouldn't have looked, but that was pretty fun.  Nice knowing we had a chance and two birdies would have done it.
Q.  You told us yesterday you had never been in that position.  Did nerves play any factor?
KRIS COX:  Yes.  I was nervous all day long without a doubt from the first tee on.  I calmed down a little bit.  I'm nervous everyday, really, so it's just a little more nervous today.
Q.  When you saw the leaderboard, how much did you change even more then?
KRIS COX:  I knew I was right in there.  No, it really didn't affect it that much, but again it was confirmation that I was in the golf tournament, so my juices were flowing.
Q.  Did you expect maybe one guy was going to step up and seize the moment or a couple guys post some good scores today?
KRIS COX:  You're so at the mercy of how you're hitting the ball.  I wasn't hitting it that well.  I couldn't get a feel for it if it was becoming easier or difficult.  So I felt someone was going to go low today, and it turned out we were all bunched up pretty close for awhile.
