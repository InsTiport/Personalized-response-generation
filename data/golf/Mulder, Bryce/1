 Q. Talk about your round today, how did it play and how was the course?
 BRYCE MULDER: I played -- it was very up-and-down. I had a couple of big numbers. I had a bunch of bogeys. I think I had five birdies and still shot 4-over par, which I wasn't the only one to have a round like that. But it's a tough golf course. You miss some shots off line and you're punished for it, and I did that. 

 Q. What about playing basically at home? It has to be a lot of fun?
 BRYCE MULDER: It is, because I moved back to Little Rock after school, and now moved to be with my wife in Scottsdale, I've been out there for five years, so I don't get back in this part very often, so it's really fun to see people that I don't get to see very often. 

 Q. What about being around Matt Kuchar?
 BRYCE MULDER: It's fun. We have got four guys in the field that have recently played at Tech. And so we had dinner with Coach Tuesday night and Matt and I played nine holes yesterday and so it's fun. 

 Q. Any wagers or rivalries with Bubba going on behind the scenes? 
 BRYCE MULDER: You know, no. No, not really. We see each other enough, there's always a little rivalry there but not too much after we all finished school. 

 Q. You had several birdies today, can you talk about those?
 BRYCE MULDER: Yeah, I had enough birdies, and I putted well. Actually if I just drive the ball well, I'll play well tomorrow. Just a couple better decisions, and about three or four swings off the tee -- not a very simple round, but unfortunately those mistakes really cost me.
