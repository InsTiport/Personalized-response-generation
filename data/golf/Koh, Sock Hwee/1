 Q.  3-over today, can you round up your four rounds here at the HSBC Women's Champions?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: I felt like I did better this year, I felt like I was stronger, more comfortable and I bounced back, just every start.  So yeah, I enjoyed myself out there.   
 Q.  What was the support out there for you?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: A lot of people came and watched me, my family, my friends.  Even though they are non-golfers, they came out and watched me because they know this event means a lot to me.  My best friends are here, and I've been very lucky, a lot of -- even just passer buys just say so Singapore, so I'm very happy to hear that.   
 Q.  What would you say is the best moment in the last four days for you?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: I mean, just I guess enjoying the competition, and I mean, I made a really good putt on the 18th hole, which is my ninth hole.  And to hole it in front of the crowd is the best feeling ever.   
 Q.  Tell us why hole 3 was so tough?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: It's just a tough hole.  Even if I lay up with your first shot off the tee, it's not like you get an easy shot to the green.  The green is quite firm, even if you land it on the firm -- there's still a tendency to be a tough hole.   
 Q.  What are your plans for the next few months?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: I'm going to play in Vietnam later this month and probably a few events in Thailand, and probably the second half of the year I'll be signing myself up for Q-School.   
 Q.  It's been a very, very hot day, possibly the hottest day we've had; what are you going to do now?  
SOCK HWEE KOH: Rest and then probably go out at night.
