Q.   Pretty impressive out there, do the winds blow this hard in Wales?   2‑under par, best round of the day. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Okay, I didn't know that, but now I do.   Played nice.
When it's like that, you've just got to control the spin of the ball and just hope‑‑ just try and keep it in play really.   You know, I did that well, and missed a couple of greens, which you're going to, and made a few good saves and then made a few good putts.
Overall, yeah, happy with the way I played. 

Q.   How tough was it out there today? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Really, really tough.   I mean, you've got to, some of the holes, which were down or straight off the left, you've got to hit hooks into the wind, and you've really got to turn‑‑ you've got to hit slices in hopes to just keep the fairway. 
So it was very difficult, every element; you'd hit a good tee shot down the middle, you're left with a lob‑wedge and you know that's a brutal shot and it's only 110 yards.   So it's tough all around. 

Q.   One back heading into the weekend, wind is supposed to be down a little bit, you have to feel good. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, yeah, I like it; more of the same.
