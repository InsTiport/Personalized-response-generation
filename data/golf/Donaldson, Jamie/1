Q. Happy birthday. How good does 66 feel on your special day?
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, great. Yeah, I played nicely most of the way, so yeah, very happy, being my birthday all. You don't really try to remember your birthday when you get to 40-plus, but yeah, a memorable day on my birthday.
Q. One of the highlights of the day was 17, the second shot?
JAMIE DONALDSON: It was not a great lie. It was sat down, a mud ball and I was going to try to squeeze a 9 on it, but I couldn't get enough on the ball to get it to the green. Just hit a 5-wood and chopped down on it and hit a low, running cut and it came out perfectly. You never know how those things are going to come out, but they come out lovely.
Q. You have a dual agenda tomorrow. You obviously are contending to win this championship, but also a high finish would secure your playing rights for next year. How do you approach it?
JAMIE DONALDSON: Just keep playing the way I've been playing the last three days, which is, you know, being aggressive. I've got a game plan, but I need to be pushing on to try to win the tournament.
