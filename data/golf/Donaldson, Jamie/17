 Q.   2‑under 68 the first round, are pleased?   It was pretty tough out there.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it was really tough.   If you got off today, you were in trouble.   It was tough all the way.   Maybe we had three holes at the end there where it dropped, which was quite nice.   But at the start, it was brutal.  
   
 Q.   You seem to be handling yourself pretty well, 15 of 18 greens.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I played nice.   Hit a lot of good shots.   Just concentrate on the swing, nice and slow in that wind, and it did enough for me to post a good score.   
   
 Q.   What were the highest wind speeds do you think during your round?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I think it gusted up to about 50 miles an hour.   Definitely felt like that; at times, you had 160 and it was playing 200, 210.   It was really difficult in places that's as hard as I've seen it here.   So it was nice to come in with 2‑under par.   
   
 Q.   How did the wind change from the start of your round?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Pretty consistent as in they were the same direction.   They just got stronger at times.   Yeah, yeah, probably 50‑mile‑an‑hour gusts in the afternoon.   It's nice to play the bear pit when it dropped a little bit.   But apart from the last three holes, we had sort of 15 holes of tough, high winds.
