 Q.   Just whipped it around in 68; how well did you play today?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, played pretty good.   I missed a few fairways on par 5s, which was important to hit out there today, because they are sort of the only holes which are closer to being a given.   They are certainly not far from it, but they are the easier holes, but played good wedge play to sort of keep a bit of momentum going.   Overall, played pretty good, so happy with the position I'm in.   
   
 Q.   All the talk this week has been about the top four winning The Race to Dubai.   You're in fifth place, and Henrik needs to finish second; you're in this, aren't you?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I'd like to think so.   I'm here, I'm playing pretty good.   Just keep doing what I've been doing and concentrate on each day at a time and see where we finish at end of the week.
