Q.   A long week but you capped off nicely with a 66 in the final round, you have to feel good about the week.   Just assess your game. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, in places, I played really good.   The first day, I played great in that horrendous weather. 
I've had two weeks off, so I felt it was there or thereabouts, but wasn't quite as I'd like.   I didn't feel really confident on every shot.   I wasn't quite on it.   But that's just sometimes with taking two weeks off. 
Played great the first day and played much better the last two days.   I played great on Saturday.   Didn't quite get what I wanted from the round.   But you know, that's golf sometimes.   These greens are really nice.   There's a lot of grain, so it's hard to get the grain right.   Hit great putts and they don't go in.
Yeah, it's been a good week.   I'm in good position going into next week.   I played nicely here.   I like the course, so, yeah, good frame of mind for next week.
