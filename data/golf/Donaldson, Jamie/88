  JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I played really solid all day.   I hit a really good shot into 9, it just rolled back into a divot.   These things happen, but I dropped shots out there, it's just how many birdies that you make. 

Q.   66 in the last round of the Bridgestone, good round today.   Has something clicked?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No, I suppose it's taken a little while to get things to work a little bit, enjoying myself, relaxing.   We've come to the normal tournaments but we haven't played as well.   But again, it's a pretty good round and a big week this week. 

Q.   You were expected to win for a long time and finally did so.   Was it a real weight lifted?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Weirdly enough, it just felt quite normal, really.   I played really good all week, and it's great to win.   I did feel great afterwards obviously, and it was great to win on that golf course.   It's a great week.   But that week is gone now, we just need to start again. 

Q.   What are the expectations when you come into a major championship?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I mean, it's a major obviously, a big tournament.   But it's just another event, really.   I'm looking at doing all the same things I do every week, and take it as another golf tournament and I've got to do the same things I do every week to make me perform as well as I can.
