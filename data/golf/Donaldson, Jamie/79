 Q.   Your verdict on round two?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, solid day.   I probably played better today in places than yesterday.   Yeah, a solid day.   It was tough out there but saying that, the wind wasn't as windy as yesterday, which made scoring slightly easier.   But I'm in a good position and I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   Essentially, there have not been all that many wonderful low scores, despite the conditions.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, even calm, it's still difficult; you miss fairways, you're in trouble.   I hit a lot of fairways today, gave myself a lot of chances, and yeah, happy with the score.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about the rough, here because anybody watching on TV, even just watching around, thinks, gosh, that looks all right; it's not the knee‑high grass you get at The Irish Open?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah the type of grass, it doesn't look too bad.   The ball just falls to the bottom.   There's a little bit of bermudagrass that's starting to come through.   Yeah, seems to fall to the bottom and it's quite thick and it's very difficult to get it out.   
The course is in great shape, though, and it's a pleasure to play it.  
   
 Q.   There was a moment out there, you missed a relatively short one, and then you nailed one from 35 feet or so?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I miss‑read one on 14.   Thought it was inside left, and it was left edge and missed.   Holed a decent putt on the next from about 25 feet on 15.   
Then bogeyed 16, birdied 17.   So a bit of an up and down coming in, but overall it was a good day and I'm in a good position.
