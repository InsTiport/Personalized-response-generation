Q.   A lot of positives to take from the week? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, today was good, played really well.   I sort of found out something on the range last night which helped today and hit a lot more fairways which enabled me to shoot a better score. 
Yesterday I played okay but didn't really get anything from decent shots early doors.   A couple of wind switches, and then you're left with near impossible up‑and‑downs. 
Overall, the week, I'm happy.   I haven't played great.   I've played well today.   The other three days weren't exactly how I wanted to play.   So you know, for not quite being on it, it was a decent finish. 

Q.   Without getting too technical, what was it that you found on the range?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Just alignment.   Working really hard on alignment, trying to straighten out my ball flight and stop slicing it into the trees, which is quite destructive.   Today the ball flight was much straighter. 

Q.   Top‑12 finish would get you in automatically next year.   Do you think you have a chance of that?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Don't know.   I'm 16th at the moment. 
You know, I think a sloppy 3‑putt on 17 was the only disappointment of the day really.   Apart from that, quite happy, wherever it finishes. 
There's things to work on and I've got a nice couple of weeks off now to get ready for a couple of tournaments here in America.

Q.   And Ryder Cup points, as well?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   It helps.   Like I said, not quite on it, a Top‑20 finish, so it's not bad.   Obviously I would have liked to have done better, but it wasn't to be and that's as good as I could have done. 
The first two rounds, I was under par for the two rounds, could have been 8‑ or 9‑over and gone home.   But I've had a decent week.
