 Q.   You must be very happy?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it was pretty perfect.   It's warmed up today.   The ball is playing farther.   The greens are pretty good.   It's very wet out there.   The fairways are soaked, but the greens are very dry.   Made for ideal scoring.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, decent position.   Played really well all day.   A few more putts could have dropped, it would have been a really strong position.   We're up there in a decent position.   Have to see what everybody else does.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   A decent lie.   It was‑‑ I had 240 front on line, so it was a flat out 3‑wood, came out perfect.   I had a decent putt, just didn't read it enough.   But, yeah, it was the shot of the day.  
   
 Q.   It's got to be in the back of your mind, the Ryder Cup?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   It's for me to play well and take control and sort it out this week.   I'm just trying to go out there and play as well I can and shoot as low a score as I can.   It's one shot at a time and that's all I can do really.   Let everything take care of itself.
