  JAMIE DONALDSON:   Solid round, didn't make many mistakes.   It would have been nice to have cleared the last but it wasn't the case.   Solid round of golf.

Q.   Just one dropped shot and kind of very much the hallmark of the kind of golf you've been playing?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, played nicely this week, as well.   I had a triple yesterday and a double the day before, so it's one of those golf courses that's set up in a way that you can't hit the ball wide, and if you do, it's a big score.   It's a really good test of golf.   The wind has been different.   The first day was one direction; the second day was totally the opposite, and today was a little bit like the first day. 
So it's been up‑and‑down, different every day.   It's a very good test of golf. 

Q.   And just the sort of test, I would imagine, that you would want at this stage of the golfing year? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, well, I don't know about that, but it would be nice to, it would be nice if the start of the year was a straightforward golf tournament.   This is a tough test.   Depends how you look at it I suppose.   We were laughing on the first day, I was playing with PÃ¡draig and we were laughing, because it was the first round of the year, and it's a very tight golf course and it's blowing an absolute gale.   So it's just perfect I suppose in a way to wipe the cobwebs off, but yeah, a tough round of golf.

Q.   When you have a title defense just around the corner, a big one, as well, what are your thoughts, knowing that Abu Dhabi is coming up next week? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I'm looking forward to it.   It was a great win last year.   Going back to anywhere that you've played and won before, is a really good‑‑ there's so many positive feelings, and you can do nothing but look forward to the golf course that you played so well on just a year ago. 

Q.   Now one round to go here.   You're in the mix, you're going to be out late, which is always the objective at this stage.   Thoughts heading into the final round here? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   It's more the same.   You know, the leaders, I don't know what they are going to finish on.   Nothing I can control.   Yeah, I'm happy with the way I played today.   I need to do the same tomorrow and just play it as well as I have done the last few days and just hole a few more putts, and it will be‑‑ there's no reason why I can't shoot a really low score.

Q.   Some big points and money to play for; we all know what's happening this year come September?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, there's a lot of things to play for but it's one week at a time, one round at a time.   This is a tough golf course, like I said, and you've got to stay focused and keep playing the way I'm playing, just hole a few more putts.
