 Q. 8-under par with two to play, two 3-putts; do you feel like screaming? 
 JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, I do. On 17 I hit a really good shot in there. I misjudged my first putt. The wind was all over the place. 
 18, I hit two good shots in. It was a very difficult first putt. It was one of those putts that if you got the wrong side of, it would fall back. So just tried to give myself a chance and I played it a little bit further right than I would have liked, but I thought I hit a good putt to be fair. The second putt I misread, thought it came more from the right than it did.
 So I gave myself a really good chance, but finishing 8, I would have been happy with finishing 8, and pushing for 9 on the 18 tee, but it wasn't to be. Overall it's been a good day. 

 Q. 7-under still a target, isn't it, of sorts? You don't think it's got any chance? 
 JAMIE DONALDSON: It's still a target but guys have to make a hash of it and I can't see it. I had to get to a minimum of 8 to give myself an outside chance. The last three holes are not too bad really. 16 is pretty straightforward. 
 And so is 17, 18. They can still make a hash of it, but they are the three easier holes. There's a lot of holes a lot harder than that earlier on.

 Q. What will you do now? 
 JAMIE DONALDSON: Wait and see. I don't think it will be good enough but it's a really tough day out there. I played really well all day. A couple of shots I would have liked to go another way. But I've given it everything, and start of the day, I was miles back, so to take this at the start of the day, you'd have been happy to do so.
