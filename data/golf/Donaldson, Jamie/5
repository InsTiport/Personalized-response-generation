 Q.  Reflections on the second round of 67 leaving you nicely in contention?  
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, played good again.  The putter wasn't quite as warm today as it was yesterday.  But yeah, overall, happy.  Hit a lot of good shots.  Especially coming towards the end of the round there.   
 Q.  Nice way to finish with a bogey at the fifth?  
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, sloppy bogey there.  Tried to really hook it around the corner.  Ended up hitting a tree and came back and ended up making a bogey.  After that, played nicely.  Played pretty good all day.  Great way to finish and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Talk us through that shot.  
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, couldn't quite get there with a 3-wood.  I had about 285 front, so hit a driver off the deck and came out so perfect.  It was nice to get it down there, only two feet from the hole.  Yeah, one of my great shots.   
 Q.  It's only been two rounds, but do you feel you're getting back to your best?  
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, I played great.  Yeah, two days, really good.  So just got to get that putter going a bit better than today, tomorrow.  So yeah, all to play for.   
 Q.  Do you relish the challenge of being in contention again?  
JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, it's great.  It's been a while.  I was in contention in the middle of the year in Sweden, so it's nice to be back up there and playing good golf, and looking forward to tomorrow.
