Q.   Your day started extremely well, four birdies in the first six holes, what was the key to the fast start?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Good putting.   I played pretty solid most of the day, but the putter was particularly hot today.   Very hot at the start.   I held a good one off the green on three.   Good par save on the first.   So, you know, there was a good few putts holed early on.

Q.   What's the mind‑set when you're playing the most difficult course of the three, even though it's great conditions, and you've got such a good start, what's mind‑set for the rest of the round? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, good start's important, because it's not many birdie chances out there.   Although today, it's been quite benign.   So, it's not too bad.   I mean, you can play away from the bunkers when there's not much wind, but it's hard to do that when it's a windy day. 
So I managed to do it, played away from a lot of the traps.   Hit it in the rough deliberately sometimes when you have to in places where it's not too long and give yourself a chance of knocking it on the green and getting it close. 
So sometimes you've just got to hit good shots, but when it's like this, you can sort of move it around quite a lot, which was the key to the day.

Q.   Your partner, Sir Steve Redgrave, wonderful Olympian; is it inspiring to play with people like this?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, he's a top bloke.   And he's playing goop today, as well.   He bested me a few times, which is great for the team score.   It was a good day, we had great fun and like I said, it wasn't too windy, so it's more fun for the amateurs, as well.
