Q.   Obviously disappointed but just sum of your thoughts on the round today?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I played pretty decent.   I just didn't hole enough putts.   I didn't hole any putts.   When I hit good putts, looked like they were going to go in and they didn't.   Hit a few bad ones, so overall it was just one of those frustrating days where I needed to make putts and I didn't.   I hit a lot of good putts.   Nothing went in.   So just one of those days.   It was just frustrating.

Q.   Must be more frustrating when you hit that tremendous shot on 15 to a foot and then a great tee shot on 16 but Patrick hits an equally good tee shot.   Maybe too much of a gap to make up at that point?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I left myself too much to do.   11th, I gave him the 11th.   I 3‑putted from nowhere.   The greens have been quite slow and that was a quick putt for some reason.   Felt like I hit a decent putt and misread it.   It's run passed and missed the one coming back. 
You can't afford to do that at this level.   Hit a great shot at the next and missed the putt.   You hit some good shots, make the putts, you win the game.   He holed a good putt there on 12 which closed the door a little bit.   Suddenly I'm 3‑down where you're looking at 1‑down, you look at trying to get it back to level.   Not the case.   Story of the day.   Just got to make more putts unfortunately.
