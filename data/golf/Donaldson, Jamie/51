 Q.   Jamie that's awfully good playing out there on a difficult golf course.   The players are raving about the greens and how fast they are and how good they are.   Is that what you found?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   You know what, yesterday I found them quicker than today.   Today they weren't too bad.   In practice they were crazy quick, I'm thinking.   It's like putting on glass.  
But this morning they weren't too bad, when I thought they might be really quick.   They'll be firmer this afternoon.   So I'm sure they'll get quicker as the day goes on.  
   
 Q.   You are a special temporary member of the PGA Tour, was that a tough decision?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No, that was pretty straight forward, I think.   The weather is just too good out here for a start.   No, it was pretty easy.   I'll play a few more events if I get invites, if I get starts and play a few more tournaments before the end of the year.   I've still got a few to play here that I was going to play anyway.   We'll just probably add a few more to the schedule.
