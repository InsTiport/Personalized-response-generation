Q.   I take it you're a happy bunny at 5‑under par? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it's a tough course.   Played nice most of the way around.   A few good saves towards the end and a great putt on 16 for an eagle, which is always nice to bump the score up.   A nice birdie to finish. 

Q.   So tell me about the eagle, what was it about that particular shot that really just got you fired up? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I drove the green, and then just rolled the putt in from about 22, 23 feet, something like that.   It's always nice to see those go in on a hole like that.   So, yeah, it was a good end to the round. 

Q.   You make it sound easy; was it something you were comfortable about your game out there today, despite the difficulty of the track? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Just played pretty solid and just tried to stay really patient.   You know, there's so many difficult holes out there; if you miss fairways in the wrong hole, it makes it very difficult to get anywhere near the green.   Just a case of trying to keep it in play and take it from there.

Q.   I appreciate it's sometimes just the nature of golf, but we kind of expected to see you do well last week, because you have done well there in the past; you're under the radar. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I was off last week.   That first day I was all over the place.   But you know, sometimes a bit of jet‑lag; it's a long way to come after a busy three weeks in a row before I came out here.   Sometimes takes a bit of time to get in stride, and, you know, today was a good day. 

Q.   So you're just more in tune, more acclimatised now?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I didn't sleep great last week, so didn't feel great.   But I'm fully acclimatised and there's no excuses.
