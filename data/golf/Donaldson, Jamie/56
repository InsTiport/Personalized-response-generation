 Q.   Back‑to‑back rounds in the 60s, you have to be pleased with the position, I know a couple of putts could have gone down for you today but they are still in a good spot?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, played pretty nice.   The putts didn't quite go in today but yeah, happy with the way I played.   Still hit a lot of fairways which is important around here, and looking forward to a strong weekend.  
   
 Q.   Got to take advantage of the spots that you can get in, but the Bear Trap to get a birdie out of 16 where you drove it, that has to feel like a bonus.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, just tweaked it a little bit left off the tee and I had a perfect angle into that slag actually, out of the bunker, and the lie was good and it came out just as I wanted it to.   
So yeah it was good to pick one up there and make two good pars, 15, 16, 17, and a shame I didn't birdie the last but overall happy the way I played.  
   
 Q.   Getting more comfortable with the venues as you're making the transition to make more in the States, how is that comfort level coming along as you make your way around the venues for the second time?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, definitely makes the difference when you've played them before.   I played here last year so it's nice to come back and know what you're up against and know the golf course quite well.   
Yeah, it makes a big difference playing golf courses, sometimes it does I suppose, sometimes it doesn't.   Sometimes you can pitch up at a golf course and see the shot straightaway and there are some times you can't.   It's nice to have played them before and come back and play them again.
