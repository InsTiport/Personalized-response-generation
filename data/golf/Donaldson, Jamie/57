  JAMIE DONALDSON:   I played really nice from the first really.   Hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens.   Give yourself lots of chances to make putts, made a few, and overall, good day, yeah. 

Q.   What have you been doing since the Match Play? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Changing nappies.   Yeah, back to, we're based in Nona while we're here with the family, so it's just a bit of practice and family time.   That was about it really. 

Q.   You have a famous landlord, don't you? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, well, it's good.   Great place.   Nice spot. 

Q.   Did you play much over the last week? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No.   I've not hit too many shots.   I probably did two days, a day and a half of practice over there. 

Q.   Just settling in? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   You must be surprised with how you played? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I played really good.   I prayed okay last week but okay is no good in that field.   You know, a couple of iffy shots, but I still wouldn't have won last week the first round.   But this round, played well, in a good position.

Q.   Take us through the eagle the on the 18th?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Really good tee shot in the middle of the fairway, 5‑wood, straight down the flag to 15, 20 feet and then made a left‑to‑righter. 

Q.   What's your schedule now?   You're out till May? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, till players r PLAYERS.   After here, next week, Doral.   Then I'll go to, then I think I've got a week off, I think.   It all depends on invites, whether I get starts or not.   I'm waiting for a couple, but it's in the luck of the gods sort of thing.   Got to play Bay Hill, then go back to playing the EurAsia Cup.   Then a week off, then the Masters, then the Heritage, week off, hopefully Wells Fargo, we are trying to get an invite for that.   Take every day as it comes and just see what happens. 

Q.   The fact you played here, does that help not playing a virgin course?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, because last year, I came out here and didn't know any golf course, you don't know grasses, you don't have to play certain shots, and you try and go a year's experience under your belt playing over here, makes a big difference for the following season.
