 Q.   Having lost yesterday, how good does it feel to get it done?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, good.   I played pretty good yesterday but sloppy in the scoring area.   Got it back to flat and then let him in at the end there.   Yeah, slightly frustrating but these things happen.   Today was important to get off to a good start to maintain your position and finished him off at the end.   Played well for most of the day and nice to come up with the victory.  
   
 Q.   Did you go out thinking you had to attack in a different way?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No, because I played pretty good yesterday.   I just tried to go out there and do the same but just with my shorter shots just tried to play better shots.   I had a few pitches where I didn't get close enough to the hole, yet today I did that well and in the end, it was enough to come up with the win.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the reaction from fans and players about your Ryder Cup exploits.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, great.   I had a lot of attention this week, and there's not been many people here and it's been very nice.   Great memories of The Ryder Cup.   But it's done now and here we are at The World Match Play on this great golf course.   
So it's back to work and start again and go out there and try and play the way I did today, tomorrow.
