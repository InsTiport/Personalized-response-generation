Q.   What do you think about that? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, pretty solid again.   Not quite as good as yesterday, it's funny, I probably played better today, didn't score quite as well yesterday; I scored fantastic and didn't play quite as well, but that's golf.   I'm in a strong position and happy to be where I am. 

Q.   Players say that advising their playing partners is a nice distraction from the pressures you face; how are you finding it?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, Steve's played nicely the last couple of days, gave him a few lines and it's worked.   It's nice when you sort of help somebody and you actually get it right for them and then they can hit it on the line that you said and they hole the putt. 
We've had a lot of fun out there for two days and looking forward to two more.

Q.   This is the first year in your career that you've played all majors and all the World Golf Championships, how has that experience been for you? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Great.   It's where I want to be playing.   You know, it's the highest level of golf, and the more I play in bigger tournaments like that, the better I'm going to get. 
So it's taken a while, but you know, I've done it all this year.   It's been a great learning curve, and I'm looking forward to doing it again next year. 

Q.   It was mentioned in commentary that you've recently been a best man; that's quite nerve‑wracking, isn't. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Oh, I reckon that's the most nerve‑wracking thing anybody can possibly do, and it's nice when it's over.   Second time I've done it, but it doesn't get any easier the second time.   But yeah, we had a lot of fun and a few beers to calm my nerves on that day.
