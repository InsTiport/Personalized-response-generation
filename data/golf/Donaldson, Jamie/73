  JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, there's a few proper tough holes out there, so if you're on the wrong side of the cut there, then it's hard work.   But if you can par the tough holes and then you've got a few chances, the par 5s are reachable, and you can still shoot a good score, I'm happy with 3â€‘under.   It's sort of a fair assessment of how I've played, and I think the lead is sort of five, six, but I couldn't have quite shot that low but tomorrow is another day.   
   
 Q.   It was Tuesday when I spoke and you are looking forward to your defense, but has it been everything that you've expected, wanted, desired?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   So far it's been really good, but a lot of crowds out there today, which made it an awesome atmosphere.   The course is playing pretty fair.   There are low scores to be had.   You know, hopefully they will come my way tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   It must be nice playing alongside the home stars in their home country?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it's been great.   Top lads and had a bit of fun on the way around, as well.   Yeah, it was a really nice day, like I said, good crowds, good guys to play with, and yeah, it's been a good start.   
   
 Q.   What constitutes a bit of fun in sometimes miserable conditions?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, we had a bit of chat, a bit of banter I suppose.   It was a little bit miserable out there but in the end the last few holes were quite nice.   It warmed up a little bit and made scoring slightly easier.
