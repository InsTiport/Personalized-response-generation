 Q.   Congratulations.   Tough match, town to the 18th hole, but you advance‑‑ not advance, you know you are going to play the next couple of days, but always nice to win the first match?  
    JAMIE DONALDSON:   Very important.   It's a tough format, because it's only one goes through from four.   It's important that you get off to a win the first game.   It was a tough game.   We sort of jockeyed well out there.   I'd make a couple of birdies, he would make a couple of birdies.   So it was up and down, up and down.   
    I holed a big putt on early doors, about 7, for par to stay one down.   That was huge in the match.   Then in the end I just managed to win.  
   
 Q.   How about the course conditions out there?   They've played some big events on this golf course, first time for match play.   What did you think of the conditions?   
    JAMIE DONALDSON:   I think it's pretty fair.   The course is really good.   It's in great shape.   The greens are tricky because they look quick in places and they are not.   Maybe they're a little bit slower than normal.   Overall, the course is in great shape.   It's a great and will put up a great test all week.
