 Q.   You turned in a great score of 2â€‘under, just take us through the round and how things opened up out there for you.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Just played really well at the end really.   I played pretty solid.   Probably only hit one bad shot all day.   I hit it in the hazard on 3 going for the green.   
Apart from that, I played really good all day.   I left a couple of putts out there.   Nothing really went my way, but overall, really solid day.   Didn't miss many fairways and hit a lot of really good shots.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of the general experience and the coastal climate; in general how did you feel about the way the course played?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   The course was awesome.   It's one of the best courses I've ever played.   It's quite incredible.   I had a great week.   Thoroughly enjoyed myself.   It's been nice and it's been windy.   I love playing on the coast; and to come to America and play this place, it's been very memorable.
