Q.   12â€‘under par, and you can't go yet, can you? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, 12 was pretty much as good as I could do out there.   I played nicely all the way.   Have to wait and see but I don't think it's quite enough, but you never know.

Q.   You're going to play your first Ryder Cup next week and you've kept your form going right up until the 11th hour, you pleased are you with that?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Very pleased.   It's great to come down here and play at Celtic Manor.   It's a great golf course, tough golf course.   Doesn't quite suit my eye.   It's been hard for me this week to keep focused and try and see the shots.   It's a golf course that you take your foot off the pedal and there's a lot of trouble about. 
I'm happy the way I played over the last sort of four or five weeks, building up to it.   I couldn't have asked for anymore, really.

Q.   It's been very impressive, the holes coming in for the leaders, 15 and 18 we know are birdie holes but how tough are 16 and 17?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   The pin position on 16 is very accommodating.   You hit a very good shot in, you can bring it in left and you hit it right of the flag you have an uphill putt. 
17 is a difficult flag.   It's right on the right edge of the green so it's hard to get close.   There are still a few tough holes coming in, but there's also a few holes where you can make birdies, as well.
