 Q.   Talk about your day?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I feel pretty good.   I played some great recovery shots out there today.   Sadly didn't play as well as yesterday, but scored better.   So happy with the position.   
   
 Q.   Looking ahead to tomorrow, what's the game plan?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Much of the same.   You've just got to take every hole as it comes out here and just try to hit some fairways.   It's a clichÃ©, but it's very important around here, the rough is very penal.   You've got to try to put the ball in play off the tee.   
   
 Q.   Is it a case of watching leaderboards and track down Justin Rose or play your own game?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Play your own game.   Won't be paying too much attention to what everyone else is doing.   Head down, get in your little bubble and keep taking one hole as it comes, put the ball in play and see if you can make a few birdies.  
   
 Q.   What have you had to do fitness‑wise, you've had some back problems; what do you have to do that other players don't have to?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I have to do a lot of physio.   The injury was quite a while ago but I did a lot of work back then to correct the problem and so now it's more manageable.   I get quite a lot of physio, warm‑ups, warm‑downs that enable me to manage the condition and play golf without problems.   
   
 Q.   When you say a lot of physio, is that hours a day?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No, sort of a good sort of 20, 25 minutes warm‑up and warm‑down.   
A lot of guys go through the same thing.   We are not getting any younger and you've got to keep yourself loose and in good shape.   
   
 Q.   Your verdict on today, please.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Very happy with the score.   3‑under was great.   You know, it's another tough day out there, even though there wasn't much wind.   A little bit scrappy at the start but recovered really well in places.   Made good putts when I needed to, and, yeah, happy with the 69.  
   
 Q.   Looked like a nice, solid, efficient kind of round, getting the job done and keeping it steady.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I probably played the best golf yesterday.   It's funny, I didn't play quite as well today, but scored better.   At the end of the day, that's what it's all about, and tomorrow is another day.   Need to go out there and hit a lot of fairways.   You can't be missing too many around here.   It makes it very difficult.  
   
 Q.   Seems like we have had a wealth of good scores today.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I've not seen‑‑ I'm just happy with the way I scored today.   3‑under, very happy and in a strong position.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts about that position?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, that's as well as I could have done.   I couldn't have really scored much better than that today.   I'm happy and what anyone else does‑‑ I can't control what they do.   The way I played today, I'm perfectly happy.  
   
 Q.   Might be a redundant question, but what do you have to do tomorrow knowing that Justin Rose is the man in command that's in form?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   We'll have a look later.   I don't know exactly what the scores are, but I can only go out and play as well as I can play and just try to hit as many fairways as possible.   You do that, and you have a lot of chances for birdies.   The greens are very pure and you get putts rolling online, they will go in.   
It will be great tomorrow.   Hopefully have the same sort of weather as today and yesterday.   It's a pleasure to play.   
   
 Q.   How valuable is it to have played last week and not be coming in here as many players are as the first tournament of the year?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Very, it's tough to come in here straight off the bat when you've been resting a while, it's been a long, tough golf course.   You could play last week and sort of get the first rust away, having a month off, it's nice to go last week and shake the rust off.  
   
 Q.   What about the philosophy for the final round, obviously right in the mix there.   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, much of the same.   Just got to hit the fairways.   I missed a few today.   Mid great recover ryes.   Tomorrow is another day and sort of need to hit the fairways.   The more fairways you hit, the more chances you have got.   It makes it very difficult, if you miss, the rough is very penal, you have to hope you get a good lie.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the message you sent to your great friend Robert Rock, the Masters invitation, what's that about?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Just a bit of banter.   We wind each other up a little bit and he didn't‑‑ he gets me quite a lot with a few things, and just thought I would just send him a little picture of the Masters invite, and, yeah, he wasn't too impressed.   But we are good friends, yeah.
