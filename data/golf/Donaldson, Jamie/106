Q. Well done today. How did you find the course played?
JAMIE DONALDSON:  It's playing a lot longer because of the changes and it's very wet, so, you know, there's no short stuff off the tee.  It's a lot different, a lot harder and playing a lot longer.
Q.  Is there any particular hole where you can say, well I used to take this club and now I'm taking
JAMIE DONALDSON:  6.  Normally I used to hit 3 iron off that tee and about a 9  or 8 iron to the green, and now it's driver to the same position.  It's not massively tight, but you've got to hit a good shot down there, you know what I mean, you have to hit a good drive.

The third is a lot longer as well.  That's a monster.  The tee has been brought forward though.  Yeah, it just makes it a lot harder.
Q.  Anything that stood out for you today?
JAMIE DONALDSON:  I played the last two well, which is a nice way to finish.  Just keeps the momentum going for tomorrow now.
Q.  How is 18 playing now?
JAMIE DONALDSON:  It's probably easier in a way.
Q.  Is it?
JAMIE DONALDSON:  Yeah, it's probably easier because the tee shot's easier.  You've still got to hit a good shot, don't get me wrong, but you don't have to cut the ball right around the corner now.  You can more or less hit in the traps with it being damp.  If the weather stays off which I don't think it will    obviously when it's running more, you're going to bring the bunkers into play.  But at the moment they are not really in play.  It will be for the longer hitters, but for the shorter hitters, it's not really in play at the moment.  You still have to hit two good shots.  The second shot is longer than it was before, but the tee shot is a little bit more easier.
