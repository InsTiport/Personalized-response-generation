  JAMIE DONALDSON:     It was quite tough early on in the wind and rain, kept composed over a few putts and kept the momentum going if you like.   The eagle on 2 was great.   I was pretty close in two.   I hit a great putt and it went in and it was just nice to see it go in to sort of give myself‑‑ put myself back in the frame if you like.   I bogeyed the first after hitting what I thought was a pretty good tee shot to be fair, and didn't reach the green, didn't knock it in.   And from there, it was nice to see a putt go in on the second and that got us going. 
PAUL SYMES:   You've knocked on the door a few times; hoping to fly it open tomorrow? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, we've just got to keep playing the same way as I've done today.   Played nicely the first three rounds but we've got to do the same again tomorrow.   Can't get ahead of ourselves in any shape or form and keep hitting decent shots on fairways and greens and wait for the putts to go in. 

Q.   You got a hole‑in‑one on day one.   How frustrating was it to see James Morrison get one on the same day and he gets a car? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Well, not really.   Obviously slightly different.   You can never put a damper on a hole‑in‑one.   It's the first one I've had on The European Tour.   So it was fantastic to see the ball go in, especially with a 4‑iron on a tough hole, if you like.   You know, surprising development. 

Q.   What did you actually get for the hole‑in‑one? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Bushmills very kindly gave me a bottle of whiskey, and BMW very kindly gave me a little vinyl plastic car for my son, so he'll enjoy that when he gets a bit older. 

Q.   You've been knocking on the door so often, how do you go into this? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I've had a few chances.   You know, but the end of the day, I've not been good enough so far to stand on the last green and be holding the trophy. 
So it's a progression, and you have to keep knocking on the door, and if it doesn't open, you have to keep going until it does.   There's no easy way than to say that it's not quite been good enough.
Tomorrow I have to do the same as I've done today and the first two days, play the same sort of consistent golf and give myself chances of making putts.   But it's one shot at a time, one hole at a time tomorrow. 

Q.   PÃ¡draig Harrington was in yesterday and he was maybe being quite cute in saying that it's a course that's easier to be the chaser, basically putting pressure on GrÃ©gory Bourdy, and now you'll be the one that everyone is wanting to chase.   How will you combat that, having a three‑time Major Champion over your shoulder? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Well, the only person I'm really playing against I suppose is myself and I've got to stay out of my own way and let the shots take care of themselves. 
Whoever is behind us‑‑ he's obviously a class player but it will be just me versus me really.   I've got to keep playing well and keep hitting fairways and keep hitting greens.   You know, take advances when they come up.   It's as simple as that really. 
PAUL SYMES:   Thanks Jamie, play well tomorrow.
