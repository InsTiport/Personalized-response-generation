Q.   Super match to match, how was it for you to play? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   We both played well, tee‑to‑green we were really solid and neither of us really set the world alight on the greens [] overall, a good game, a halve is probably a fair result.

Q.   You played as well as you could but you never got a head in the match but looked like you were going to sneak it at the last.   What was in your thoughts? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     I thought at the end I deserve to win the match so that's why‑‑ (laughter) I thought that was a very fair result.

Q.   You may have to play together in a year or so time, you've got to be friendly. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     Oh, absolutely.   I think it's always a great pleasure playing with Jamie.   We are good friends and it's always fun, and I think that's what this tournament is about.   It's about team spirit, it's about match play.   I can't believe the guys that are not here supporting this thing because I'm just loving it. 

Q.   Enjoyed it? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   It's been great, second one I've played in now and just want to play in more and obviously Ryder Cups.   It's a great format.   We don't play enough match play, and to play in a team environment, match play, is just so much fun.   We've had a great week. 

Q.   What's your verdict on that match? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, we both played well tee‑to‑green.   You know, it was a good match.   It was a lot of good shots hit.   Like I say, we didn't really set the world alight on the greens.   Both weren't quite on it on the greens, which would have been an even better game but overall, we had a really good game.   You know, I think probably a halve was a fair result in the end.

Q.   A lot of nip and tuck in that one. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, sort of quite up‑and‑down.   I got to 2‑up at one point but gave him one hole and then he made a birdie on another, so got it back to all‑square.   But, you know, overall, it was a pretty tight game. 

Q.   You're concentrating on your own match; do you have a little sneaky glance at what's happening elsewhere? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   No, I haven't looked.   Looking now and it looks relatively even‑Steven.   Just have to hope that the lads pull it off. 

Q.   Like honor of being the first match out with the onus on you? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I do like it.   I like to go out first.   It's a great honor and it's a position I like to be in really, thoroughly enjoyed it, like to go out first, get going, not waiting at all.   It's about fun. 

Q.Your first point in the Seve Trophy, how important was it for you to get that point today? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It's always come down to the last and I've always been short.   To get a point, hopefully that can go towards a winning total for GB&I, looking at the scoreboard now, we need a bit of a comeback at the moment.

Q.   When you saw that you were facing Joost, did you think, I've got no points and I've got to play against Joost? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Not at all.   It's match play.   There's 20 of us there that can all play, and you know, you don't know how each is going to turn up every morning.   I played pretty good today. 
I had a bit of a practice session yesterday, and I felt good coming out, and Joost obviously didn't play his best, but that's the way it goes.   It's nice to get a point no matter who it's against, and we know Joost has been on fire recently so it's been nice. 

Q.   Enjoyed it? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, it's been a great experience, a nice little bonus to the year so hopefully we'll be back again.
