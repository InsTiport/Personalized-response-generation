Q.   Great up‑and‑down at the last, good round of golf, and in conditions this afternoon, very pleased with that? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it's a very good start.   It's very difficult out there.   It's blowing very hard.   It's a very tough finish, and to get up‑and‑down there was a nice way to finish on a tough day.

Q.   This morning the guys did have the best of it, and you must have been aware of that. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it was windy this morning.   But that's generally the way it goes.   You know, it's pretty calm in the morning, picked up as the day goes on, so, yeah, it was tough this afternoon.   Hopefully we'll get some better conditions tomorrow and post a number.

Q.   A golf course you like?   Clearly a golf course that's very scorable with a number of opportunities out there. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, lots of chances.   When it's windy, even with no rough, it's very, very difficult, you just try and put the ball in play and give yourself a chance.   Like I say, even with no rough, it is very difficult. 

Q.   This season, getting that first victory, you seem to have a lot more confidence about you and clearly you're playing that way and feeling good about things right now? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, I'm playing pretty good.   I just had three weeks off which has been nice, spent a lot of time at home with the family and stuff.   Finding my feet again and nice to go out there in conditions and shoot 4‑under.
