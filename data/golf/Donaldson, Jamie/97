   JAMIE DONALDSON: I made a few birdies coming in, which I needed to. It was just tough, a bit of a slow start. I hit a lot of good shots to start and I hit a few bad ones, as well, but it was a strong finish. I took advantage of the downwind holes and here we are in a it good position.

 Q. You weren't the only one who struggled today. A lot of people found it tough going. Can you put your finger on why?
 JAMIE DONALDSON: I think the wind is slightly stronger than yesterday. It didn't really feel much different. I don't know, maybe the pins were a bit tougher. They felt very similar to yesterday. 
 It's just tough again, you know. You've got to sort of, like I said yesterday, make the most of the early start. You've got to sort of hang in there and then make a few birdies down the stretch.

 Q. With that strong finish, you must be full of optimistic being going into the final round tomorrow?
 JAMIE DONALDSON: Yeah, I put myself in a good position. It was nice to finish like that. I needed to finish like that to give myself a chance, and we did finish well, and here we are in a good, strong position.
