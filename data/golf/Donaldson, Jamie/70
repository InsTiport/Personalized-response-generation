Q.   Looked to us like you played extremely well, is that the way it felt to you? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, we both played well.   I think the key a lot of the time is the fact that we were both in a lot of holes which made it easier for one of us to make the birdie to close out the hole. 

Q.   A new partnership, how well did you know each other before this week started? 
MARC WARREN:   We knew each other really well.   Sam asked me about from the obvious Scottish partnerships and I mentioned Jamie the other night and worked out today.   I was basically caddying for him today. 

Q.   You're being spoken about as a potential Ryder Cup player; does playing in this make you even more determined to make that team? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Match play is such an exciting game.   I love playing match play.   Played a lot of match play as an amateur.   To play in this tournament is very special.   It's a great event, and the more match play I play, the better. 

Q.   Last time you played Seve Trophy, practicing in the room, you knocked the chandelier down, injured yourself; not great fun.   No practising this time?
MARC WARREN:   No, clubs are staying at the course this week.   Definitely no practise swing in the room.

Q.   Would you like to be playing with this fella in foursomes? 
MARC WARREN:   If he plays like that again, absolutely.
