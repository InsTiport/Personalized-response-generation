 Q.  Jamie, your first every Ryder Cup match.  You played with a legend and you won.  Try to sum that up for us.  JAMIE DONALDSON: Wow.  It's quite an experience here.  My first Ryder Cup, it was just incredible playing with Lee.  Playing against two quality players, like Jim and Kuch.  It's a battle.  We played as well as we could play.  So it just how tough it is in this format and in this great tournament.   Q.  How impressed with this are you and how much do you enjoy that role?  LEE WESTWOOD: I love it, kind of watching somebody take to it like a duck to water.  There was no doubt in my mind that Jamie was up to the task.  He just played great out there, never missed a shot. Between us, we were around about 4-under and that was a high quality match in these kind of conditions.   Q.  Try and describe the atmosphere from a player's point of view.  JAMIE DONALDSON: That first tee is -- it was just like a sudden death playoff in a major or something like that.  It's so many people, like 20,000 people on one hole.  It's just incredible an awesome event to play
