Q.   Thoughts on the round?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Didn't really score great.   It was there or thereabouts.   Left a couple out there.   So yeah, it was an okay day. 

Q.   Do you expect more when you get off to the start that you did? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Well, I'm just trying to just play every hole as it comes.   I hit a lot of good shots.   I hit a lot of shots to where I wanted it to, and then I hit quite a few shots sort of 20, 25 feet.   Over the course of the day, I didn't hit it close enough to make enough putts.   When I did, I didn't make them, either.   So overall, it was a so‑so day, and 1‑under was a pretty fair reflection of how I played.   I didn't hit it close enough to the flag to enable myself to make enough putts.

Q.   Is it easy enough to keep your mind on the job at hand and concentrate on The Wales Open? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it's fine.   Yeah, I was pretty much focused on my job I had to do today.   Just didn't quite do it as well as I'd like, but overall, it was okay.

Q.   You are playing alongside a teammate, so what's your appraisal of how Lee Westwood has played?
JAMIE DONALDSON:   I wasn't paying too much attention.   I was only trying to concentrate on my game.   You know, Lee has just come out from America, so he will be firing on all cylinders by next week.   So just reflecting on the way I played, I suppose.   Like I say, just hit it close tomorrow and have a better chance of making putts to shoot a low score.
