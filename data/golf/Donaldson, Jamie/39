  JAMIE DONALDSON:   I hit a lot of good putts that just sort of run over the edges of holes and a little putt for par on 12 and good birdie on 14.   
But like I missed the 13th fairway by a couple of feet, and then it makes it difficult to control your second shot with you're getting jumpers out of the first cut and it's hard to get near flags, especially when they are on the front of the greens like they were on 13.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts going into the weekend, seven behind the lead but only three guys ahead of you?  
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, you know, like yesterday was good.   We played nice.   Today was sort of okay.   I need a couple of really big days, which is possible.   Like I say, hit a lot of putts that nearly went in but didn't.   Just went over the edge of holes.   Need to make those tomorrow and try to get a bit more compression on my iron shots to get it close to the flags.   
   
 Q.   This is a tricky golf course any time.   When the wind gets up like that, how tricky is it?   
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, it was tricky.   Like yesterday was flat calm.   You could attack flags, go at flags.   Today it blew a bit from the off really.   It's just tricky to hit fairways.   That first cut and second cut are quite thick, so the ball sort of nestles down which makes it hard to get it close to the flags.   
So it's becoming hard to hit fairways.
