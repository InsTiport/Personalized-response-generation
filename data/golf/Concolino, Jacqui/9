Q. So what was it like playing out there with Sei Young today and how she was performing?
JACQUI CONCOLINO: It was saw some it was a great experience.  First time I think for me being in that position playing with the leader and the winner of the tournament eventually.  So it was a great experience.  I was kind of zoned out.  I didn't really realize how low she was going, but I mean she put on a phenomenal performance, and she deserved it.
Q. Were you feeding off that at all?  I mean you put together a pretty good round yourself for a solid finish.
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, no, it was good.  I don't know like maybe feeding off of it, but seeing someone make putts, you know, it boosts your confidence, too.  Opened up the hole for everybody.  So it was nice to see a lot of putts go in, and I would have liked a couple of more, but I guess she got them today.
