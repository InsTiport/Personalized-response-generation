JACQUI CONCOLINO: It was on the 5th hole, a 5-iron from 159 yards. It caught the ridge there and we all watched as it slowly rolled into the hole. I just jumped into my caddie's arms when it went in, a great moment for sure. Overall, I wish I had played better, obviously. This was my fourth or fifth hole-in-one in competition but to get one in the U.S. Open is particularly special.
