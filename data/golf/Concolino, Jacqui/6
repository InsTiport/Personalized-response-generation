 Q.  Was that the most nerve-wracking ten minutes of your life?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: I wouldn't say nerve-wracking.  I'm obviously excited to be in the position I was.  Cristie making the putt on the last hole is kind of inevitable I guess.  It was a great experience this week.  Absolutely loved every second of it.   
 Q.  Hate to bring it up, but that putt on 18.  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, I hit a good putt.  I read it just outside, either a little more pace or a little higher.  Just touched the right lip.   
 Q.  Overall, what's the takeaway from the last week for you, especially today?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Just know that golf is not a game of perfect and you're going to hit some loose shots.  You've just got to keep your head in it.  If you can stay patient long enough until you get hot with the putter, then you can put yourself in contention, which is what I did.   
 Q.  Is the putting what got you here this week?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, ball-striking, and then made a few putts yesterday obviously on the front nine.  That jumped me up the leaderboard quite a bit.
