Q. You were going great guns today, minus six on the front nine and you dropped a couple of strokes on the back nine.  Would it be fair to say today was a bit of a bittersweet round for you?
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Got off to a super hot start, and played pretty good on the back.  I just got a little unlucky on a couple of shots.  Plugged in the bunker on the par 5.  Went for it in two, so really had nothing there.
You know, just a couple of loose shots on the back but nothing major.  Just a couple more putts and I'd be right there by the top.
Q. In any case, would you say you've found a new level in your game since Taiwan last week?
JACQUI CONCOLINO: A little more confidence, absolutely.  I love bermuda and reading the lying in the fairways and chipping and on the putting green.  So for me, I feel at home on bermuda, which last week as a little bit of that and this week.
Q. Lastly, what do you think are your chances of coming away with a victory tomorrow?  What score do you need to shoot?
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Cristie is obviously going pretty low the last 36 holes.  I'd have to say I'd probably have to get on a run like I did today and maybe need some help from Cristie, as well.  But I like my chances if I continue to play with the confidence that I have.
