 Q.  Looking like the round of the day so far.  Can you tell me what was going on out there?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: I don't know, I was just in a good mental place today.  Pretty calm.  I knew it was going to be tough, so you just embrace it and take the good bounces with the bad.  I had a couple more good bounces than bad ones today.   
 Q.  You had four pretty good rounds this week, and particularly on the weekend when the weather was kind of adverse from the beginning.  Does that give you some encouragement?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, absolutely.  Links golf is a different animal than in the States, and the more you play it, the more creative you get.  I don't want to say it gets easier but your options open up and you can hit more shots, the more experience you have on it.   
It was a great weekend and certainly looking forward to going next week to the RICOH and another challenge at Lytham.   
 Q.  Do you feel like this was a good prep for next week?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: 100 percent.  That's why I came over here, to prep, to get some tournament rounds in and in links golf in tournament conditions, and making the cut and playing well on Sunday and Saturday was a bonus.   
Obviously if I was a little closer, I would have been thinking more about winning the tournament, but was just a little too far back I think.   
 Q.  Were you able to enjoy your time here in Scotland this week?  
JACQUI CONCOLINO: Yeah, North Berwick, great time.  Went to the Butcher.  Got some lobsters.  You know, the pubs around here are always lively and met some New Yorkers the other day and they were having a blast.  It's been good.  I've had a few pints this week and looking forward to having a couple next week.
