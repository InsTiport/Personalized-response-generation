 Q.  Level par today, that's a fantastic score.  You must be happy with your play today?  
TOM LEHMAN: I am.  I played well.  Conditions were very tough.  What helped us is that the course is soft.  The greens were soft and the fairways were soft.  If it were firm, in this wind, it would have been so much more difficult.  But the soft course helped us.  The wind was very tough, and even par is something I'm very happy with.  I saw a round of 2-under, that's amazing.  It proves that this course appeals to him.   
The wind just got stronger.  We started the day, it was strong, and then a big rain squall came in and then it actually died down just a little bit for a couple of holes and thought we'll get lucky.  Then the sun came out and the wind picked up and it's just been getting stronger the rest of the day.   
It's very difficult.  There's no easy shots.  Downwind, crosswind, they are all tough.  I think the secret isn't to hit it too hard, then you can control it.  The minute you start swinging hard at it and get it going sideways, you're in big trouble.   
You're going to hit some bad shots and it's not always going to be pretty, so you have to be willing to accept some ugly shots and some bad outcomes and just keep on firing away.  I think that's the only way you can approach it.   
 Q.  Looking forward to the rest of the week?  
TOM LEHMAN: I am.  I've always enjoyed playing with wind.  Whatever the reason, windy conditions have generally appealed to me.  I feel like I've played some of my best golf when it's windy.  You have to really be on your game, so I'm looking forward to the challenge.
