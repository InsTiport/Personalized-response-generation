Q.  How did you feel about the first game?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I thought it was well played.  The first teams seemed to play pretty well.

You know, it was good play.  I think they played well, and just didn't quite get the ball in the hole quick enough.
Q.  Was it a relief when you got that first point because Padraig and Monty came back quite strong against your dream team?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Yeah, I didn't see the whole match, but I think Tiger didn't play his best, Jim played well at times, but they played well together, and that was a big point.  It was the first point of the day, so it's still a tight match.
Q.  You never want to be behind after the first session, but that's the situation you're facing.  What would you hope to get out of it by the end of the day?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I believe if our guys can keep playing the way they're playing, maybe a little more aggressive with the putter, we're going to be really good, just fine.  I would hope when it finishes today, a tie we'll be happy with.
Q.  Let's hope the weather clears up.  Thanks, Tom.
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Thank you.
