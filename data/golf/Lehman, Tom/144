Q.
Talk a little bit about today's round.
TOM LEHMAN:  Front side, drove it well, and I didn't really make any putts at all.  I mean, I made zero, nothing at all.

You know, it seemed like it was a round where I had to make the putts, and the harder I tried, the more frustrating it got.  I just didn't get the ball to go into the hole.
Q.  Are you planning on playing next weekend?
TOM LEHMAN:  No, this was my last event of the year.

I'm going home to regroup and come back next year.
Q.  Are you going to keep the same caddie?
TOM LEHMAN:  Well, at this same time next year maybe.
