Q.   How did things go for you today?
TOM LEHMAN:   I played well.   It's a tough course.   It's tough to get it close. 
I think I had a lot of in between yardages today, especially where it wasn't any real clear club.   Sometimes you need a perfect club to get it close to some of these pins. 

Q.   Any unusual birdie putts?
TOM LEHMAN:   No, no.   It was a pretty standard round.   For the most part I hit it real well and I made a few nice putts for par when I had to.   Never hit it close that often.   I had a lot of 20 and 30 foot putts and a lot of good putts that didn't go in, but all in all I'll take the score. 

Q.   In a Major, usually anything in red numbers is a good score.   Did you feel that way today?
TOM LEHMAN:   We had a nice day to play.   It got a little bit breezy, but not bad.   I would say, you're right, under par is always good and you can always look and say, well, I let that one get away or I could have taken advantage of that over there, but basically you just take what you get and if it's under par every day you'll be happy.

Q.   Do you think conditions will be similar the rest of the week?
TOM LEHMAN:   I don't know.   I have no idea what the forecast is.   The wind is going to be what the big issue is.   If it gets windy, then scores will certainly rise quite a bit.   If we get four days like this, I think you're going to see somebody come in with a pretty good score.
