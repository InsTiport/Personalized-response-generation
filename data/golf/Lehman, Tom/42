 Q.   Can you talk a bit about your round today compared to Thursday.   
TOM LEHMAN:   Yeah, I didn't play very well today.   I thought the course was really there for the taking today and I didn't take advantage it.   I'm disappointed.  
   
 Q.   Has it been a tale of three courses between the weather on Thursday, kind of a bit more calm yesterday and then today?  
TOM LEHMAN:   It was windier in the morning and then calm in the afternoon and the scores are pretty one sided in terms of the draw.   So today I thought it was an easy day.   It was a squall that came through early, but for the most part it was really nice.   I'm disappointed that I shot 70.   I feel like it was capable of a lot better.
