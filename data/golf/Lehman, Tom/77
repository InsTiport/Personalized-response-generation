  Q. How was your first round today?  
 TOM LEHMAN: I played very well. Obviously 4-under with the wind blowing the way it was was something that I'm very happy with. I started with a bogey on the first and I finished with a bogey on 18 and in between I played extremely well. So I have no complaints.   
  
  Q. What was the toughest part of the course for you today?  
 TOM LEHMAN: Just dealing with the wind. The wind was very gusty, very strong. Trying to get the right club especially. You have to hit it solid. You have to hit it solid when the wind is blowing like this. If you hit it solid you can deal with it. And today I did that.   
  
  Q. How is the altitude, has it affected you at all?  
 TOM LEHMAN: I played enough here at the International so I'm pretty familiar with how the shots will fly. And it's a bit of a guess at times, but I think we did a really good job today of pulling clubs.
