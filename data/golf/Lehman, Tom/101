CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I just don't know if there's been a European team that's played better.
Q.  You've been quoted as saying in the past your team had issues, but this seemed to be the most unified team ever.
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Absolutely, absolutely.  Our team came ready.  Our team came very ready.  I guess we weren't quite ready enough, or I'm not even sure what to say.  But I definitely need to give credit where credit is due, and the European team played better.
Q.  What advice would you give the next captain?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I've got to think about that.
Q.  Were you happy with the way the match was played, the spirit?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I thought the crowd was great.

I thought the players genuinely played with respect for each other, had all of the emotion and passion, but it was a well, well played match.  The guys were simply fantastic.
Q.  You put everything into this.  Is there anything you'd change now with hindsight other than the result?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I think second-guessing is a waste of time.  I do know that everything we did, we did for a reason and with the best possible intention.  You always probably have to think about what could we have done and done better, what could we have changed to make it work out better.  But at the end of the day you still have to put that ball in the hole, and that didn't work out very well.
Q.  A word for your opposition.
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I tip my hat to them.  They played inspired golf, and they never, ever did not make us pay for a mistake that we made.  They made us pay every time.
Q.  Congratulations on the way you've conducted yourself.  Thank you.
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Thank you.
