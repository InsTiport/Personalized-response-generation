 Q.  Talk real quick about the match today. 
TOM LEHMAN:   Well, it was an up-and-down round for Ernie.  He started out playing well and then struggled the back nine.  I made some mistakes on the front nine, even though I was playing well, and just kind of hung in there on the back. 
It was a tough day to play.  It was pretty breezy and it was difficult to get the right club in your hands, and the greens were getting very fast.  The short ones were tough to make.  You know, he had a couple of 5-footers on the last two holes, and he made one and missed one, which is about par for the course out here.

Q.  On the extra hole, what did you hit in there?
TOM LEHMAN:   I had 120.  I tried to hit a pitching wedge that would go in low and skip up the hill; hit the top tier and skipped over.  Hit a pretty good shot, just too hard  -- we got fooled by the wind a little, I think. 

Q.  Have you faced him before in like the Presidents Cup or something like that? 
TOM LEHMAN:   Not in match-play.  But we've played in stroke-play a lot.
