TOM LEHMAN:  I played pretty well, actually.  Both days, I feel like I played pretty well, and suffered -- well, one bad swing each day which cost me five shots.  So, I was, you know, fairly policed with the way I played.  Still had the ability to make putts  -- (inaudible)   -- come out not terrible.

TOM LEHMAN:   Well, I hit a good tee shot, but I had a really bad lie in the fairway.  It was sitting in a little hole, and I actually was more concerned about hitting it fat.  I had to hit downwind, and it wasn't a full sand wedge.  I was  more concerned about hitting it heavy than hitting thin.  I caught it a little bit thin and knocked it right over the green.
