TOM LEHMAN:  It makes the rest of the game seem easier, as well.  I would really say getting the right pace, it's everything with putting, and it gives me a lot of confidence.

Q.  Aside from feeling better because of the great weight loss, what aspect of your golf game has it helped?
TOM LEHMAN:  I'm driving the ball great.  I've been driving the ball extremely well all year.  I feel like I'm hitting it a little bit longer.  I'm definitely hitting it straight, putting it in play a lot.  You know, I feel like I'm stronger with really every part of the game.  I don't feel like I've got a weakness to try and hit a 3 iron 220 yards.  I feel like I can take that 3 iron and smack it and carry it the way I need to.

Q.  You're going against David Toms, our defending champion, tomorrow.  Your thoughts on that match?
TOM LEHMAN:  David is a wonderful play.  I've played him enough to understand his game, and it's really a strong game.  He hits it really straight, hits it far.  He has great control of his irons.  He hits it the right distance a lot and has one of the best putting strokes in the world.  I've had two tough matches already, it'll be one more really tough match.
