  Q. Just talk about your day. Your round today.   
 TOM LEHMAN: It's tough. It was a tough golf course. And I hit some kind of bad spots, but I just kind of seemed to get out of trouble today.   
 I hit a lot of good shots too, but a little up-and-down, but in the end I guess I scored pretty well and it was kind of -- it was a nice day.  
  
  Q. The course started off a little fast, did you notice a big change when you came back out after the delay?  
 TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, we were on 16 green. So we had to play 17, it was straight down wind and hard as a rock.   
 So I was able to make a par there and par 18. That's a good finish right there.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about the way you are right now going into tomorrow as tough as the course has played?  
 TOM LEHMAN: Oh, I got to play a little better tomorrow. I got to start driving the ball a little straighter than I usually do and I didn't really play my best today.   
 But it's the first day, so we got a long way to go, so I'm happy with where I'm at and I look forward to tomorrow.
