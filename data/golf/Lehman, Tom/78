  Q. Nice round under your belt.   
 TOM LEHMAN: I did, I played well. I wouldn't say that I felt all that great starting the round, but I kind of worked my way into it and hit some good shots and made a few good putts, and by the end of the day I kind of felt like I was hitting on most of the cylinders, and it felt good.  
  
  Q. What's the key to playing this golf course?  
 TOM LEHMAN: I think being patient. If you did a case study on Calc's round today, it would be the perfect case study for how to play. He didn't probably play his best for a portion of the round, and he ended up birdieing -- eagling 15, birdieing 16, birdieing 17, birdieing 18, I think, the last -- it was a lot of birdies and eagles coming in to shoot 3-under. You can make a good round out of a not-so-good round very quickly out here.  
  
  Q. And as a guy who's played a bunch on the Champions Tour and a bunch over here, what is the real difference?   
 TOM LEHMAN: I think there's a lot of really good players out here. For starters, there's only, what, 78 guys in the field on the Champions Tour. But they're very good players. I'm going to give them all the credit in the world for how well that those guys over there still play, how hard they work, how dedicated they are still to playing their best golf, and you have to play well to win.  
 Out here, though, there's just 156 guys each week, and they all hit it really long and they all can putt and just a lot of really good players. I look at the scoreboard right now, and I had a good round, shot 5-under, and I'll be lucky to be in the Top 10 by the time the day is over.
