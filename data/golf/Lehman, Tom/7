 Q.  69, happy with that today?  
TOM LEHMAN: Well, I played well and left a few -- didn't putt very well today. Tee-to-green, I think I played very, very steady and an exceptional round of golf. Did not make any putts, really, today, and that's disappointing because I had my chances.   
 Q.  Nice birdie at the last to finish minus nine. Been a good week for you at St. Andrews?  
TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, it's been a good week. Just being here is fantastic. To play well, it feels nice to play well. You're never happy unless you get to the top. You look back and you think of all the mistakes and all the things you could have done better, but this is a special, special place for me, for our family, for the world of golf. There is no better championship than a championship at St. Andrews, and just thrilled to be a part of it.   
 Q.  And how special was it today to play with Tom Watson?  
TOM LEHMAN: Well, he's always been someone that I admire very much. It was fun. I was hoping he would play a really good round of golf. He tried. He played the course the way it was supposed to be played. He didn't back off everything and he took every aggressive line you could take and just didn't work out for him. To be out there with him was special.   
 Q.  And of course you're looking forward to next week?  
TOM LEHMAN: Of course, any time you get to play, you get to go back to Lytham, very, very good memories. My dad was with me, he's no longer here, which is too bad. It would be nice to take him back but other than that, it will be a special time.
