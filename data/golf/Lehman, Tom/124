Q.
How hard was it out there?
TOM LEHMAN:  It got tougher as the day went on.  I'm sure you're hearing the same story from everybody, but when we first started I felt like it was tough.  Then it got tougher and then the greens started getting extremely, extremely fast, really, really quick.  Back nine was just trying to survive, trying to hit the ball in the right spots and make pars.
Q.  What's the mentality of a player out here when he plays early Saturday as opposed to playing in one of the groups that are the final couple of groups?  Are you more aggressive because you know you need to climb up the leaderboard or do you try to play the same way you've always played?
TOM LEHMAN:  Around here I play the same way I always play.  I don't think I play it any differently whether I'm in last place or in the Top 10 or whatever.  It's the kind of course you have to respect, and you're happy to make pars.  Then when you get the ball in position and you have a crack at birdie you need to go for it.

That said, teeing off at 1:30 today, even though I played at 11:00 o'clock and it was windy, it was windy all the way through.  The greens are getting tougher and tougher as the day goes on.

The guys in the last groups are going to have their hands full.  There's enough birdie chances out there where you can still shoot a good score.
