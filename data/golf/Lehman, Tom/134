TOM LEHMAN:  I didn't play well on the back nine at all. It's disappointing for sure because the weather was perfect, but there's always tomorrow. I love it here. This part of the world is phenomenal and I love this golf course. I've always felt comfortable here and even though it's not links golf I think it's a great way to prepare for the Open Championship. You are competing against great players on a great golf course and I that's the ideal way to go into an Open.

To say that Paul was hitting it a long way is an understatement. He was hitting it forever!
