Q. Tom, top-10 finish --
TOM LEHMAN: Maybe, maybe not.
Q. Talk about the way you played today.
TOM LEHMAN: Well, I thought the course played harder today, much harder.  It's firmed up the last two days significantly.  Some tough pins, but the fairways are wide out here, and if you're driving the ball halfway decent, you're going to hit a lot of fairways.  I really think that's why you see so many decent scores.  It certainly doesn't explain how one guy can be 18-under.
But as far as my game goes, I was not very precise with my irons all week.  I didn't hit it close all that often, didn't give myself tons and tons of really good chances.  I made it really hard to shoot something low.
Q. What do you think about the chances of the guys who are trying to catch him?  Are there enough chances out there?
TOM LEHMAN: Well, there are chances, but it takes two to tango with that.  It means that Steve Stricker is going to have to play poorly, and I don't see that happening.
Q. He's getting up-and-down like crazy.
TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, he's such a tough guy and such a good player.  But momentum is a big thing.  If someone who's right behind him, whatever it is, five or six shots back, made two or three birdies in a row and he makes a couple mistakes, that lead can get shrunk in a hurry.  If you can get to within two, then it's anybody's ballgame.  But with the way he's playing, I don't quite see it happening here.
