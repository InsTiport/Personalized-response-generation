Q.  I'm sure you're disappointed losing today, but you had a great week, won four matches, and I'm sure you had a lot of fun doing that.
TOM LEHMAN:  Yeah, I did a lot of things I'm very proud of.  I gutted out every shot the whole way.  And today I just didn't have it.  I hit too many loose ones.

But I probably shouldn't have won this morning.  I didn't play well against Chad, but he played a little worse.  I didn't deserve to beat Geoff Ogilvy this afternoon.  He played very well and I didn't.  I did do a lot of things extremely well this week that I'm very proud of.
Q.  Overall as far as your game, I know you lost some weight and really got in good shape the last X number of months.  Where do you think your game is and where can it go the rest of the week?
TOM LEHMAN:  I'm going through my wedge game.  My wedge is down a little bit.  My bunker game really helped out a lot today.  I think the scoring clubs I can definitely make some big improvements on.  Putting is one of those things; you can never putt good enough.
Q.  A lot of people would ask this.  You obviously proved your chances of making Ryder Cup on your own merits this week.  Maybe some comments about that?
TOM LEHMAN:  We'll see how that plays out.
