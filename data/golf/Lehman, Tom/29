  MODERATOR:   Tom Lehman shot an even par 70 today and finishes the Championship at 2 under par.  
   
 Q.   You said yesterday you had trouble keeping it in the fairway.   Did you do a better job today?   
TOM LEHMAN:   I played all right today, just made too many bogeys.   Every time I hit a few bad shots, and when I did, I typically made a bogey.   I made a few birdies as well but didn't really save par all that much.   All week long, it was a bit of a struggle on the greens.   I feel like I rolled it pretty well, but nothing really went in.   
So when I look at my Tournament, it's going to all be about not making any putts.  
   
 Q.   As USGA setups go, what did you think about this week, Tom?   
TOM LEHMAN:   I thought it was set up really well.   Only one frustration out there, and that was with the tee back where it was on 18 yesterday.   Only because up on the right side where I hit my ball, it was so steep, the ball rolled back 25 yards.   I just don't like giving up yardage in the fairway like that.  
Overall, I thought the course was set up beautifully.   The course was in great condition.   The Club here did a great job of hosting this event, and the City was absolutely an Aâ€‘plus in supporting this Senior Open.  
   
 Q.   Thank you.   
TOM LEHMAN:   Thanks.
