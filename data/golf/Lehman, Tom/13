 Q.  After the eagle on 6, things were looking really good.  What transpired then?  
TOM LEHMAN: Had a couple more good chances.  Then the 10th hole, which has been -- 10, 11, I've really struggled the whole week so far.  I think I bogeyed 10 twice, and I think played 11, 4 over both days.  11th hole, I hit a big mud ball on the fairway, and it went dead left against the wind, went back right again, and ended up way short.  Hit a mediocre pitch and missed the putt, so bogeyed.   
Then hit a bad drive on 11.  Ended up short and left, which I thought would be a good spot, and it was.  I though I hit a tremendous little pitch, and it ran up the hill just past the hole and just trickled barely too far and down the back side.  And then chipped it to the front of the green from there and made a nice, easy double.   
So from that point on, I played well again.  I hit some good shots and hit some good putts that didn't go in.  But kind of lost my momentum a little bit.   
 Q.  How much was the wind a factor today?  
TOM LEHMAN: It was definitely a factor, I thought, especially putting.  Really had a hard time putting, really getting the feel for the speed.  You know, factoring in the slope.  The greens were somewhat slow in spots and somewhat fast in spots.  There were some really quick putts and some really slow putts.  Add the wind on top of that, it made for difficult putting, I thought.   
 Q.  The play of Kenny and Kirk going so far ahead of you guys?  
TOM LEHMAN: Tremendous.  I wasn't quite expecting that.  I was expecting to play a little better myself.  I thought, if you could shoot anything under par today, I thought would be tremendous.  Even par is a good score.  But 4 under when you have the lead, especially, is really sensational golf for both of those guys.  You have to tip your hat to both of them for playing so well.
