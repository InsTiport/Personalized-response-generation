TOM LEHMAN:  Yeah, it was easier, definitely, a beautiful day.  I kind of got sucked in in the wake of Phil's 60.  That's kind of the way it felt.  He played incredibly well and made the game look really easy today.  He hit it close a lot.

Sometimes when you play with someone playing that well, it helps to be around that.  You get more positive thoughts.  I'm happy with 65, but he definitely played a great round.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TOM LEHMAN:  Well, golf is an unfair game.  I think the guys that played yesterday morning definitely had the worst of it.  They will have a great afternoon, but yesterday morning was tough.
Q.  The difference between the greens yesterday and today, your impressions?
TOM LEHMAN:  Well, they're softer today.  They were probably about the same speed, but they were manageable; the ball was holding.

You don't have 30 mile an hour winds blowing across.  That really affected all of the shots, but the putts, the wind could blow a put an extra couple feet sometimes, so the wind was a big factor yesterday.  Today it's going to be better scoring.
