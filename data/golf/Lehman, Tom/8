Q. To be under par today, you had to play well?
TOM LEHMAN: It was rugged, a very rugged day.  You need to avoid the bunkers.  You need to get the ball up there somewhere where you can try to make a par a lot of times, so very often it wasn't pretty.  You just had to be effective.
Q. Of course, different conditions today, strong crosswinds.  It was tough coming in, was it?
TOM LEHMAN: It was.  It wasn't directly in our face, so if you could get the tee shot out there far enough where you could actually make something of the holes, 13, 14, 15, 16, you could get it far enough down the fairway where you could hit reasonable clubs into the greens.
Q. Nice to hole a nice putt on 18?
TOM LEHMAN: Of course.  It's always nice to birdie 18.  I played pretty well the back nine.  Had some chances.  So to finish with a good note is good.
Q. And you're inside the Top-10.  How do you find your position now going into the final round?
TOM LEHMAN: Well, obviously I like where I'm at.  Hit a lot of good shots this week.  I'm rolling the ball fairly nicely.  I don't know what tomorrow's weather forecast is, but I think there's a lot of guys who are playing well.  It's anybody's game.
