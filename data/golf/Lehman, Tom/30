  MODERATOR:   Tom Lehman shot an even par 70 today and is 2 under par for the Championship. 
TOM LEHMAN:   This is easy.   I'll just talk with you.

Q.   Kind of an up and down today, Tom, roller coaster? 
TOM LEHMAN:   Yeah, too many bogeys.   I played fairly well.   I just mis‑clubbed a couple times, hit a couple shots that were in the rough, and I didn't really putt very well either. 
Overall, 70's a good score today.   It wasn't a bad score by any means, but it just wasn't the score I needed.

Q.   Tom, No. 4, it seems, is kind of puzzling you a little bit out there, what to do off the tee? 
TOM LEHMAN:   Yeah, I hit it two days in a row in the same spot almost.   Yeah, it's an awkward looking shaped shot for me.   There's a bunch of shots out there that feel this way.   That tee shot on 14 is another one.   The tee shot on 4.   Just feel like it doesn't really work with my draw very well. 
So I try to╩‑‑ I get a shot to get out there to work with the terrain, and I just overcut it, which is typically an error that I make when I try to fade the ball.   So I need to fix that quick.   It would be nice to hit it in the fairway once this week on those holes.
