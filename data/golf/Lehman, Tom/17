Q. What a morning for you?
TOM LEHMAN: The U.S. team really played well.  Obviously two really good comebacks for victories, two matches that got off fast and just kept the pedal to the metal.
Really a great start for the U.S. team.  I'm not sure what else to say, but I know that we've been building for this for a long time and looking forward to it.
Q. Talking about a plan coming together?
TOM LEHMAN: We have great teams.  The guys are all playing well.  The most difficult I think for us was finding who to sit.  We had a bunch of great pairings.  These are the guys that seem to be the best fourball teams that we could put on the course and they have all delivered.
Q. After everything that's been said, what will this do for the team?
TOM LEHMAN: Our goal is to win every session.  Whether we win a session by half a point or one point or four points, the goal is to win every session.  And now we have gotten the first one out of the way..
