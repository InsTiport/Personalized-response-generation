  Q. 1-under par. How do you feel about that?  
 TOM LEHMAN: Well, you know, I'm really disgusted with my putting. I hit the ball beautifully for two days and just putted poorly. I left a lot of shots out there on the greens.   
 So that's the good news/bad news. If I can keep on playing the way I'm playing, and make a few more putts, I think I'll be okay. But I've got to get that putter working.  
  
  Q. First visit to Walton Heath, what do you think?  
 TOM LEHMAN: A plus. Absolutely tremendous golf course, in every way. Just maybe I drive it well. The irons need to be on target, have a good putting touch. But really the big thing is off the tee, have to put the ball in play and then know what you're doing with the driver.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible), what's behind the great form?  
 TOM LEHMAN: Well, you know, right now been hitting it well all year. The first half of the year I putted very well.   
 It's all about the putting with me. When I putt well, I tend to have a good chance to win. If I don't putt well, I struggle a bit.   
 So my putting has been, for the most part, very, very steady. I could count on it most of the time and trying to find that form again.
