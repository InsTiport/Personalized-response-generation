Q.
Every match came down to the 18th, could have been either way.  You lost the momentum maybe a little?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Well, it was a very tough finish, no doubt about it.  It stings a little bit.  Even still, the teams played well.  Both teams played well this afternoon.  Great matches, very excited.  We could have used a little more luck on the greens.  It just didn't seem like those putts wanted to go.
Q.
What positives can you take out of the day?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  I think we played hard.  I think we played with a lot of heart.  We just didn't get the putts to drop.  The Europeans obviously made a lot more putts than we did.  It was still 5 3.  5 3, it's still anybody's ballgame, so I don't really feel too concerned, but we are a little bit frustrated.
Q.
Any reaction to how the rookies performed today?
CAPTAIN TOM LEHMAN:  Yeah, we had a bunch of guys that played great.  I'm really proud of the way Zach Johnson finished and Chad, and J.J. this morning and Brett gave it all he had.  We're going to go back in and decide this won't happen again
