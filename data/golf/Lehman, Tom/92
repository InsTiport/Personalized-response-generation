 Q. Talk a little bit about your round today coming out shooting even par?
 TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, it was very difficult out there. It's playing very difficult. The greens are firm and fast. Even par is more than acceptable. 

 Q. Can you tell us how you feel now after two days, with the way the course has played so tough?
 TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, I like my spot. I like my position. I'm doing enough things right. I don't feel like I'm doing anything exceptionally well, but I'm doing a lot of things decently. So it's good. I need to hit more fairways and make good shots and make some putts.
