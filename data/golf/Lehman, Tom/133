TOM LEHMAN:  I hit the wrong club off the tee at the last but I was really unlucky with the ruling at the last. It's the correct ruling (after overshooting the green) and it went against me big time. I had a chance to make a par and then you are looking to make five at best, so to make a six as I did with a five wood, sand wedge, leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Q. The other 17 holes?
TOM LEHMAN: There are little flashes of good mixed in with some lousy shots. I'm not playing particularly well, although I am putting well enough. Hitting enough good shots, but not consistently.
Q. The luck's not been with you?
TOM LEHMAN:  No, I just miss not playing my best. Sometimes when you are not playing your best you don't get the bounces you do when you're playing well.
Q. Given what happened in London yesterday, are there any fears about security for next week, or the possibility that your American colleagues will still travel?
TOM LEHMAN: I think they will. I think security was already pretty tight. That makes me so angry I can't begin to tell you. The Open Championship is pretty small by comparison. We'll be playing a golf tournament while other people's lives have been changed. It's a tragedy. I take my hat off to Tony Blair. He's a courageous guy and he's meeting this head-on. I really admire him.
