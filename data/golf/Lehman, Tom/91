  Q. First of all, 69 today, talk about your round today?  
 TOM LEHMAN: I played very well today. I suppose I may be through a couple away, but I made a couple nice saves. So it all kind of balances out. And I probably got what I deserved.   
  
  Q. Here at 9 where we picked you up, you had a birdie to tie for the lead. Describe that putt.   
 TOM LEHMAN: Very slow, right up the hill and I hit a beautiful putt and it was dead on-line. Didn't hit it hard enough, 22 feet or something. Typical of the day, hit a solid putt, hit it on-line and I made a few. That one being so slow left it a hair short. No, I'm very pleased with the way I'm playing.  
  
  Q. Can you compare the conditions from yesterday to today, please.   
 TOM LEHMAN: It was a bit tougher yesterday. The greens got really baked. They were extremely fast and very firm. Paul Goydos said the greens were firm; I gave him a chance to rephrase that; they were rock hard.  
 This morning the greens were holding. They are speeding up. The wind is not quite as strong. I think it's a better day to score today.
