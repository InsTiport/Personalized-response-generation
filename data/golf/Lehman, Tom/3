 Q.  Thoughts on the day, level par?  
TOM LEHMAN: I played really well today.  I just had a couple of unfortunate experiences in a couple of bunkers.  I made a triple on the third hole.  I get a good tee shot and unlucky second shot and end up making a 7.  Nice comeback, and got myself back in the game again, so I think even par was a good score.   
 Q.  It's been a long day, but nice to finish with a nice birdie on 18?  
TOM LEHMAN: Yeah, it is.  Always nice to finish the last hole on a good note.  Hit a very nice tee shot, beautiful iron, nice putt that will make dinner taste better.   
 Q.  Only 15 players under par, so you are still in contention.  
TOM LEHMAN: Oh, yeah, this is a very difficult course.  So many difficult shots.  You have to be really concentrated and you have to be so focussed on your game and never letting up, so I'm happy with that.
