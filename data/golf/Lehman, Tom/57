 Q. As defending champion your position here right now, do you like where you are right now?
 TOM LEHMAN: Not really. No. No, I'm not really happy with the way I played. I haven't played well at all. I really hit a lot of bad shots. 
 Finally kind of got a little bit of something going the last seven holes or so, but I'm hitting it all over the map and not feeling good about my swing. 
 So on the one hand to be 1-under with hitting it lousy is okay, but on the other hand, I know what I'm capable of and I'm not happy with it. 

 Q. So do you still give your self a chance though?
 TOM LEHMAN: Oh, yeah, I mean as long as nobody gets out there to 12-under par or something, you know, I feel like if I can, you know, for me it's all about tomorrow. I mean if I shoot a good round tomorrow get myself within three or four shots of the lead, I still have a chance.
