  Q. Tell us about how your round went today and the conditions out there.   
 CHRIS TUCKER: Well, the conditions are great, the score, I mean, I just played very poorly. I putted horribly, really. I missed a couple fairways at the end, but most of my scoring was just due to poor iron shots and poor putting. But the golf course is perfect. Obviously there will be some good scores today.  
  
  Q. Did you feel like you were just maybe on the wrong side of the hole or just didn't putt well?  
 CHRIS TUCKER: Both. It was just tough. When it rains it powers. It was pretty bad from start to finish.
