  J.T. POSTON:   It was kind of one of those match play rounds where I don't think either of us really had our best.  I would say Billy probably played better yesterday than he did today, and I'd say I probably did the same.
 You know, that's the format.  Sometimes when the guy you're playing kind of gives you an opening, you've got to hit the right shot.  I'm happy with it.  I think I can kind of control my own destiny tomorrow, which was kind of the goal at the start of the week, so yeah, I'm excited?
 Q. What do you think is working for you?
 J.T. POSTON:   You know, before this week I hadn't really hit the ball that great, but I had done a really good job with my scoring and chipping and putting around the greens and kind of staying in it, at least leading up to this.  In match play that's huge.  I think today and yesterday I've hit it a lot better I'd say than the last few weeks, so I've given myself a few more opportunities.
