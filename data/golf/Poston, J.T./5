 Q.  After winning at Greensboro, were you so much looking forward to playing the Masters? You still could very much get that opportunity but it will not be in April. How did that impact you?  
J.T. POSTON: Yeah, that's not a fun message to get. That's a tournament that I've been looking forward to since I was a kid, and still very much looking forward to it. I know I'll get my chance at it. Just won't know when that'll be.   
 Q.  How difficult has this day, yesterday been, last night?  
J.T. POSTON: It's been tough. I mean, I know right now it's not very much in our hands. I trust Jay's judgment and decision, and I know they're going to make the right call. Right now we're just kind of doing what we're told to do.   
 Q.  Given everything that has happened, are you shaken?  
J.T. POSTON: A little bit, yeah. This is obviously new territory. I don't really know what to do from here. I was telling my girlfriend this morning that I can't remember the last time I didn't really know when I was going to play my next golf tournament or when I didn't have a golf tournament that I could look forward to playing to and kind of prepare for. I guess my plan is to sort of keep practicing, playing, get ready for whenever we do get to play again, but it is a little different not knowing when that'll be.
