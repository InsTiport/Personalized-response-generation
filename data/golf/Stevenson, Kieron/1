 Q.  So, how was that?  
KIERON STEVENSON: It was great.  It was great to be out there with someone playing so well.  It was an absolute pleasure to be out with Haydn.  He's a lovely young man, and he played really good golf.  One bad shot on the 18th, and it wasn't even a bad shot.  He just got a wee flier on the 18th, and out of bounds it went.  But, yeah, it was a pleasure to be out with him.   
 Q.  How did you play yourself?  
KIERON STEVENSON: I played okay.  I've hit some good shots and some bad shots.  I didn't keep score, but, yeah, it was great.  It was great fun.   
 Q.  When did you get the call?  
KIERON STEVENSON: It was about 10 o'clock last night.  As soon as Haydn had come off the 18th last night, that's when I knew.   
 Q.  That was it?  
KIERON STEVENSON: Yeah, that was it.   
 Q.  What was it about his game, what was he doing?  
KIERON STEVENSON: Everything.  Yeah, he hits the ball a long way.  He's very good off the tee, and his iron play is very solid, and a soiled putter, so pretty much the whole game.   
 Q.  Was he learning from you and you were learning from him?  
KIERON STEVENSON: Him and his caddie are experienced, so they do their own thing.  But, yeah, we had some good chats out there.  He was lovely.  Really nice to play with.   
 Q.  Are you from Troon?  
KIERON STEVENSON: I'm from Ayre, next door.  So local boy.   
 Q.  How long have you been here?  
KIERON STEVENSON: I've been the pro nine years, so nine years I've been here.   
 Q.  How are the greens this morning?  
KIERON STEVENSON: They're good.  Absolutely perfect.  They're a nice pace.  They're not really, really quick, but they're quick enough.  Just perfect.  Absolutely perfect.   
 Q.  Did the wind affect you?  
KIERON STEVENSON: Not on the greens, no, it wasn't affecting the putting, but the wind on the back nine is really tough.  Haydn hit some fabulous iron shots in there.  The guys are going to have to play really well on the back nine today to score well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
KIERON STEVENSON: Yesterday afternoon was about as hard as it gets.  When Haydn came in yesterday, last man in, that was truly awful yesterday, and that's about as bad as it gets.  So he did well to make the cut.   
 Q.  Quite impressive for him.  
KIERON STEVENSON: Absolutely.  It's just a shame at 18, but, yeah, he did great.  Played well.   
 Q.  Did you enter qualifying for The Open yourself?  
KIERON STEVENSON: No, I've been involved in the Championship Committee here.  So, no, I've been doing other things.  Luckily I got to hit some balls first, but, yeah.  It was great.   
 Q.  A good day?  
KIERON STEVENSON: Wonderful day.   
 Q.  How old are you?  
KIERON STEVENSON: I am 43.
