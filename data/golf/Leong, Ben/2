 Q.  Thoughts on your round for the day.  
BEN LEONG: Yeah, it was really one of those days.   
Just ups and downs and, yeah, I hit some bad shots and made some good putts.  It was just a clumsy round, I would say.  I mean, I didn't have my game today.   
But I just told myself to just go out there and play and enjoy myself and, yeah, I mean it's -- I mean actually, I'm sort of happy, even though I'm like way down in the field.   
But considering the way I played, I'm still 1-under for after two rounds and, yeah, I mean it's -- I know this golf course never favors me, but I try to put that aside and I've been looking at the scores and I'm still really happy and proud of myself.   
 Q.  Birdied the last to be in the red numbers, so heading to the weekend that's a good positive for you?  
BEN LEONG: Yeah, it's a good end to my round and hopefully, that will push me tomorrow morning, hopefully, and I can get off to a good start there because that definitely really helps, especially on this golf course.   
 Q.  How far was the birdie on the last?  
BEN LEONG: About, maybe, 40 feet.  Maybe around 40 feet.  Yeah.
