 JAMES OH: Sure. Long day for me. 
 
Q. What time did you get up this morning?
 
 JAMES OH: 5:30. 
 
 JAMES OH: Actually, I only went 13. 
 
 JAMES OH: Yes. 
 
 JAMES OH: The last hole, par-3, No. 5, I was up first to hit, and I was hitting it
pretty well. I hit a 7-iron up there a little bit left to bounce up about ten feet. And
Bryce pulled it a little bit; went to the left; hit a great chip up there, a little closer
than I am. And I made a 10-footer. I saw a lot of those putts, and I remember what it did;
so I did the same thing. 
 
 JAMES OH: I was pretty confident over that putt. I've been putting real well. I haven't
been real nervous yet. So it went in. So I'm sitting here: That's good. 
 
 JAMES OH: All day. I mean it was back and forth all day. I started with -- I was 1-up
-- I think I was 1-up after 2, all square around 7, and then I was 2-down after 15. I won
16 -- I won 18. 
 
Q. 15.
 
 JAMES OH: 15? 
 
Q. You went 15, and pushed 16 with bogeys?
 
 JAMES OH: Oh, did we? Okay. Thanks. 
 
Q. It was a long time ago.
 
 JAMES OH: It's been a while. 
 
Q. How were you at the turn, all square?
 
 JAMES OH: All square. I can't remember. 
 
Q. 18, you pulled out a 3-wood and hit that shot really close.
 
 JAMES OH: On 18, I was watching TV. I was on television before I started my second
round today, and everyone who was 2-down, or 1-down going into the last hole, hit their
drive left; so I didn't want to do that. I went right at the second tree on the left, hit
a drive, hit a perfect drive. And Bryce kind of pushed it, and he didn't hit too good of a
-- he kind of hit the tree on the second shot. But knowing Bryce, he's an excellent
player. It shows when he hit that third shot about ten feet on the 18th; so I figured he
was going to do that. The layup is not that easy, either, it's 2- or 3-iron, and there's
trap left, and there's all the rough to the right. Why not just go at it; I needed to win
the hole. So I pulled out a 3-wood. It's kind of gutsy, I guess. 
 
Q. What was your yardage to the front?
 
 JAMES OH: I had 250 to the front, and it was just blowing straight into the wind, stiff
wind. I hit a real good shot. It went up right to the front. I'm lucky it didn't go in the
deep rough. I was trying to hit it in the front trap. The sand traps are pretty easy out
here. And my third chip, I had a perfect chip. I thought it was going in, just missed the
cup to the right. And Bryce hit his putt, and kind of hopped and came up short. And I had
a two-footer to win and tie the match. 
 
Q. The bunker saves at 17, and the bunker save at 2 kept you in it, obviously?
 
 JAMES OH: Yeah, definitely. 
 
Q. Tell me about why the bunkers are so easy at Pebble Beach; it's not a common
thought?
 
 JAMES OH: Actually it's easier -- well, I'm comparing it to Spyglass. Spyglass is
pretty tough. But I practiced a lot of bunker shots there. And come here, it didn't seem
that hard; get better lies out of the trap. If you look at it, it's a lot easier than the
rough. The rough is the hard part. Out of the sand trap, it's not that bad. 
 
 JAMES OH: Well, to beat Bryce, that's -- he's a great player, and he's one of the top
amateurs in the country. I was just trying to push it to 18. If I lose, I lose. Just give
it my best, don't lose early. And I guess I am surprised, but I've been working hard this
summer. I kind of expected to play well at this tournament. 
 
Q. The tee shot at 15 went right to the rough, and he's in the fairway, you're down 2.
So you're down 2 and he's in the fairway, looks like he's in command, what are you
thinking at this time?
 
 JAMES OH: I thought if I hit it up there -- he's got a real long shot. I just tried to
hack it out into the fairway. And I looked at his second shot, the one in the rough, and I
figured that's not an easy shot. But if I make par here, that will put the pressure on
him, and it will be hard for him to make par. So I think that was the turning point.
That's where if I didn't win that hole, I wouldn't be sitting here. 
 
Q. Bryce said that down the stretch he was having a lot of fun, and he even turned to
you as you guys started on 1 again, and said, "Are we having fun yet?" Was it
fun out there, or were you nervous, or how did you feel?
 
 JAMES OH: I wasn't too nervous, but I was giving it my best, and we were both grinding.
And we played pretty good golf. Made a couple of mistakes, but other than that, it was --
it was fun. 
 
Q. What was going through your mind when Bryce hits the cart path at 1 and saves the
shot and gets up-and-down and gets up-and-down -- 
 
 JAMES OH: That just shows -- 
 
Q. He's in a ditch on 3?
 
 JAMES OH: Yeah, that just shows what kind of player he is. He's awesome. That's why
he's one of the top amateurs in the country. I kind of expected that, because he's hitting
his wedge shots pretty good. And if he punches out, it's not going to be an easy win. But
I thought I had it on 1, but I guess not. 
 
Q. How does the pressure here compare to what you felt in the U.S. Junior?
 
 JAMES OH: I don't really feel much pressure out here, because I'm here to learn, and
it's still a new experience for me. I'm still young; so I have a few more years for the
U.S. Am. But U.S. Junior, it's over. At U.S. Junior it's -- the competition is just not
quite as tough as out here. 
 
Q. Does that experience help you? You've had a lot of match play experience; you've
won, and in the USGA events?
 
 JAMES OH: Definitely, I've played the Pub Links. Finished in the quarterfinals; lost in
the quarterfinals there. That was pretty good. I played well. And that was one of my
biggest -- I learned a lot at that tournament. Just got back from the U.S. Junior. Lost
the quarterfinals there and learned a lot out there. Every time you play another match
play event -- every big event I play in, it helps me. 
 
Q. During qualifying, was that your father that caddied for you?
 
 JAMES OH: Yes. 
 
Q. What's his name?
 
 JAMES OH: Mike. 
 
Q. Now, you had Hunter Meehan on the bag?
 
 JAMES OH: Yes. 
 
Q. Do you guys play together?
 
 JAMES OH: We're pretty good friends. He used to live in California when we were real
young, about 10, 11, and he moved to Texas. I haven't seen him in about four years, and
he's like the best golfer in the country now. 
 
Q. Where is Lakewood?
 
 JAMES OH: Lakewood is by Long Beach, Los Angeles. 
 
Q. Which course do you play there?
 
 JAMES OH: Lakewood Country Club. 
 
 JAMES OH: I don't have a brother. 
 
 JAMES OH: Yes. No brother. No sister. 
 
Q. Will your dad be back on the bag tomorrow? Hunter said he's leaving to go back to
LA?
 
 JAMES OH: I think Jason Harwick may caddy. He's from Sacramento. He's real good, good
friends. 
 
Q. You're just going to go through all the juniors out there?
 
 JAMES OH: That will be great. 
 
Q. Is it less stressful with your dad not caddying for you, and just --
 
 JAMES OH: I think so, I know what he's going to tell me. I know exactly what he's going
to say, so -- but he does help a lot. He does. He keeps me in it. I was 3-down after four
holes -- no -- yes, 3-down after four; and I got it all square after 9; and 2-down after
11. And when you're 2-down after 11, you almost lost, because going back and forth. And
then I came back and won it; so I guess he helped me there. 
 
Q. Because the interplay of that second shot at 18, Hunter said more or less: Don't
blame me if the shot doesn't go right. Did he keep you loose and relaxed? 
 
 JAMES OH: Yeah. He's just like -- I don't know, real good -- he helps me a lot. He kind
of caddied for me at my last tournament. It was East versus West, and we were on the same
team. If you're not playing, you have to caddy. He caddied for someone in my group, but
helped me a lot. I figured he could help out here. And he's great. 
 
Q. Where was the Candy Cup this year?
 
 JAMES OH: Long Cove on Hilton Head Island. 
 
Q. Your dad is a golf teacher; is that right?
 
 JAMES OH: Yes. 
 
Q. Is he a golf professional?
 
 JAMES OH: He teaches little kids. 
 
Q. So he taught you, I assume?
 
 JAMES OH: A little bit. A little too much. 
 
Q. Who beat you at the Pub Links, that was the quarterfinals?
 
 JAMES OH: Yes, Michael Kirk, another top amateur. 
 
Q. Who do you fear most that's left in this field?
 
 JAMES OH: Tomorrow morning? 
 
Q. Who do you get tomorrow?
 
 JAMES OH: I don't know. Kim, yeah. I usually never look ahead. I'm one match at a time,
always. In match play, whether you're a good player or bad player, anything can happen; it
can go any which way. So I really concentrate on tomorrow morning's match.
