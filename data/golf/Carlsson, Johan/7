 Q.   Talk about playing in tricky conditions today?  
JOHAN CARLSSON:   In the end, it turned out okay.   I had a couple good putts in the end that made me still in the game.   I started out good, got off to a good start and I had a couple of stupid bogeys, two in a row, versus one club on two holes.   That cost me two shots.   But the shots were great.   So can't say anything about that.   
But all in all, I feel, I'm pretty satisfied in the end today because I made a couple good putts at the end.   Something of everything, even at the last hole.   Beautiful drive and then a lovely putt to make sure of things.   
   
 Q.   The leaderboard, it's very congested.   
JOHAN CARLSSON:   It is, I haven't looked‑‑ I try to look up instead of down, you know what I mean.   So I've got two shots up to the guys on top, and I'll just try to go out and do way did yesterday, instead of today.   
   
 Q.   I presume that's exciting when you play the game.   
JOHAN CARLSSON:   Yeah, you're right, you're right.   You've got to hit a good one early and just feed from that.   That's what I'm going to try tomorrow.
