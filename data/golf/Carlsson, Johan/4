JOHAN CARLSSON: Actually, it's kind of funny, I thought I had my card secured for quite a long time, so I've been working hard on some swing changes and kind of satisfied with not playing my best up until this week.  I felt like, okay, let's play this week with whatever I had.  I'm really happy that what I had was good enough.  I felt really good.
Q. Sounds like it suddenly dawned on you, you have got to do something?
JOHAN CARLSSON: It's going to be borderline where I am at right now, so I probably need one more tournament where I play decent or half decent.  Not the way I've been playing lately.
Today was good, though.  It was fun to play with no swing thoughts or anything, just playing.  Made it a bit easier.
Q. Do you step onto this course thinking this is one that should suit you, perhaps?
JOHAN CARLSSON: Yeah, plenty of opportunities out there.  As long as you hit the fairway, you are looking at good chances.  I did that today.  I think the course suits me good, yeah.
Q. I take it it's nice to round off with a good save from the rough there at the last, as well?
JOHAN CARLSSON: Yeah, absolutely.  I almost went in.  Absolutely.  It was a bogey-free round today, which made it quite nice and the par on the last as well.
