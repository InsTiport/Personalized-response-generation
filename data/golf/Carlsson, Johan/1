Q. Excellent start, 65.  How was that?
JOHAN CARLSSON: It was good.  It was a lot of fun out there.  I've worked a lot on my attitude to feel a bit more positive over every shot, and it seemed to work really well today.
Q. A quick start, especially on the first opening holes?
JOHAN CARLSSON: Yeah, it was a good start.  It's all nice when you start with a couple of birdies.  You get going, you get a little momentum; it's easier.  Hopefully it wouldn't have matter, because trying to stay positive no matter what.  But obviously it went my way today, so it's easier.
Q. How were playing conditions?
JOHAN CARLSSON: Playing conditions were good, yeah.  We didn't have a whole lot of wind.  It was quite cold.  We were first off this morning, so obviously ball goes a bit shorter.  But when it starts heating up like it is now, it's perfect conditions, I would say.
Q. Looking forward to the rest of the week in a good position to go forward?
JOHAN CARLSSON: Absolutely.  It's never bad to be in the lead and I really enjoy it.
