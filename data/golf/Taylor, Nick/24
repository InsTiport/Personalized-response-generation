 Q.  Just comment on your round out there today.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, through eight holes I was kind of hitting it a little squirrelly and was 1-over.  Actually made a couple good par putts to stay there.  Made a really good putt on 9 to get it back to even, which was big, and I knew the back nine was scorable.  I started hitting some really good shots and made some putts, so that was nice.   
 Q.  Nobody really moved out to a big lead, so it's going to be a shootout tomorrow.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I was a bit surprised to be honest.  Through maybe nine holes I hadn't moved much in my position, let alone the leaders hadn't moved much.  I think 11 or 12 was still leading.  It was a little surprise, so maybe get a little jump in my step and I knew the back nine was gettable, so luckily I was able to do that and kind of give myself a shot tomorrow.   
 Q.  What's been the key for you all week to be in this position with 18 to play?  
NICK TAYLOR: I drove it pretty well and actually hit it close quite a bit.  The putter was a little bit better today than yesterday.  I didn't putt great.  But if I keep hitting it like I am, make some putts tomorrow, hopefully I've got a shot.
