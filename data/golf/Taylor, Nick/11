 Q.  Great second round to back up that first round. You birdied four of the last five. You kind of turned it on late, didn't you?  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I hit some really good shots coming in and made all the putts. So obviously it was all coming together there. 12 was a really good bogey save that kind of kept my round together, and hit some quality shots coming in, so it was nice to kind of capitalize coming in.   
 Q.  7 through 13 are tough holes. If you can get through that, you got through 1-over. That's pretty good playing because those are tough holes.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, once you get to 8, realistically it's kind of a grind. 11, I actually had a pretty good opportunity there but that green is so severe that you're just lagging the putt from 6 feet. And, again, made a good bogey on 12. So after that I gave myself some chances and made a lot of them coming in.   
 Q.  Talk about the last two days, though, because you have played well and you really had a good season up to this point, so the game must be in a good spot.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I really love coming to this stop. I feel like from here and the next few months, are probably my favorite stretch of golf tournaments. And again, been putting really well. Last week I played pretty solid. That course really doesn't suit my eye as well as it does here, so I was happy to come here and it's been nice to make some putts.   
 Q.  The putts you made, though, they're tough reads. They're poa annua. That makes them even tougher and you obviously like that too. The last two putts you made were not easy.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I grew up on poa annua, so I have some sort of comfort level on them. But I feel like I've been reading them pretty well. I'm just trying to keep my head down and hit putts as good as you can. They are going to bump offline occasionally and you kind of do your best and hopefully they will go in.   
 Q.  Did you look at the scoreboard? You got some nice names up on that scoreboard.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I've got to keep my head down, keep moving forward. There's two rounds to go, so there's a lot of golf and so tomorrow is Spyglass, so focus on that.   
 Q.  You opened up with 63 yesterday. Backed it up with 66 today. How were you able to keep that momentum going on a golf course that you call your most favorite in the world?  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, again I played pretty solid tee to green and rolled some really nice putts in today. It was nice to get off to a really good start, I was 3-under through 6, and I made some pars, some good pars in the middle of the round, actually made a really good bogey save on 12 and made some really nice putts coming in the last five holes.   
 Q.  As a rookie you won in Mississippi. You've been on the PGA TOUR six years. How are you a different golfer than you were when you won back in Mississippi as you look to try to win yet again here?  
NICK TAYLOR: Six years is a long time. I feel like my game's definitely better well rounded than it was when I came out here and, yeah, I feel like tee to green, I'm just much better, much more consistent and experience helps as well. So I think there's a few factors, but just better overall.   
 Q.  Great finish here today, birdied four of your last five. How do you try to keep that momentum going as you head to Spyglass?  
NICK TAYLOR: I think the forecast is a bit of wind tomorrow, so Spyglass, there will be some challenging holes out by the water but that's usually probably the toughest golf course of the three, so just keep my head down and try to make some birdies.
