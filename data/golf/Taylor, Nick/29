 Q.   How did your round go out there today?   
NICK TAYLOR:   It was good.   Got off to a quick start and kind of held on from there.   So it was fun, played really fast and it's nice being first out.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions a little bit.   The wind is not toom too bad?  
NICK TAYLOR:   It picked up a little bit in the middle of the round but I think for here it was pretty benign so it was perfect all day.   Can't beat the views.   It's fun.  
   
 Q.   The pace you guys kept up, can you stick with that through the rest of this tournament?  
NICK TAYLOR:   I hope so.   I don't think so, just because we were first off and we were zipping through, but I would love to play a round like that every time we play golf but it's not realistic unfortunately.  
   
 Q.   Shots out there you would like to take back?   You were tied for the lead for a while and went down to second, sitting about third now, I think, although it's early.   Holes you'd like to replay?  
NICK TAYLOR:   Not really, and first round, I haven't played golf in a month.   If you told me 69, I would have been happy.   I made a few 3â€‘putts but also one putts, too, so I'm pretty happy.  
   
 Q.   Wind pretty calm; not much of an effect on things?   
NICK TAYLOR:   A little bit, the higher hole it definitely a little bit effects, but I think it's supposed to calm the next few days, too.   Today might be the most we'll see.   So it's the best conditions possible.  
   
 Q.   Good feeling to come to a place this far from home and have people out here supporting you?  
NICK TAYLOR:   It's so awesome.   So many northwest people, I went to school at the University of Washington, so a lot of Huskies and Canadians.   It's awesome to have support.   I'm excited for the West Coast Swing, that's for sure.
