 Q.  Nick, I know you wanted to squeeze a little bit more out of a Friday morning tee time, but good position going into the weekend.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, definitely.  It was a little tougher today.  Some of the pins were tougher.  It was playing a little longer.   
You know, every time I seemed to miss a fairway I had kind of tough lies, so that's where a few of the bogeys came from.   
Played pretty good.  Just didn't make a couple putts coming in.  Would've like to shoot maybe 2- or 3-under, but in a good spot.   
 Q.  Curious if you had shot 66, 67, it would've been sort of the same score; when you go 64, 69 does it feel any different even though it's the same position going into Saturday?  
NICK TAYLOR: Not really, no.  It's tough to follow up a good round, like it seems to be, like always.   
Yeah, any under par this morning I kind of would've been happy with.  The scores weren't as low.  There were some low scores, but, again, I would've liked to have grabbed at least one coming in, but overall it was good.   
 Q.  You mentioned yesterday tee to greens things have been pretty solid for you.  These greens seem like they could be simple, but are there interesting little dimensions to them that make it hard when it comes to the five- and ten-footers?  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, what makes it tough right now is the fringes and the fairways are soft; the greens are bouncing; so some of the front pins you land a foot short it stays there; if you land a yard on it's fifteen feet by.   
The front pins are tricky.  There are a lot of salty breaks.  A lot of times you can see it going left then right unless you play straight (indiscernible.)   
So outside of that, it's just the front pins with tough, but rolling pretty good.  Feel confident.
