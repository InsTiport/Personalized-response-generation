Q. Solid round, clean card.  You've got to be happy with that.
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, felt good.  I felt like I was hitting it a little better before the delay.  Felt a little off the last few holes, but made a couple putts on the last two holes, so that was nice to finish the round off.
Q. What's been the turnaround for you in the last three or four, five tournaments?  Looks like you're starting to hit your stride.
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I've been hitting it better.  Finally starting to score.  Scored definitely a little better last week.  Struggled on the greens the first couple days, went back to cross-hand the last couple days, and that definitely seemed to help, especially the last couple rounds.
The greens have kind of been holding me back a little bit, just not being able to turn decent rounds into 68s, and I'm shooting 72 and vice versa, so it's nice to shoot some low scores and see some putts drop for sure.
Q. Are you noticing a big change in conditions out here compared to previous years?  Seems a little softer.
NICK TAYLOR: It's definitely softer.  I think we dodged a bit of rain, so it actually wasn't that soft after the rain, after the delay.  It's definitely softer than three and four years ago, but I played here in '08, '09, and it was a swamp out here, so I've seen it all.
Q. What does it mean to you to play well here?
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I'm at a point I've just got to play well with a few tournaments left.  Being low Canadian would be nice, but that's not really my focus.  It's nice to have a solid round to start the tournament, and hopefully I can have a good one tomorrow morning.
Q. How nice is it to get finished tonight after that delay knowing you're going to go right back out?
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I'm early tomorrow.  Yeah, it's nice to be able to finish and not have to come out and restart, finish the round, then kind of restart.  It's kind of a long day.  So it's nice to finish for sure.
