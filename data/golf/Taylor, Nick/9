 Q.  One-shot lead beginning this final round, turned into a four-shot victory by day's end, but it was far from a stroll in the park. How would you describe the ebbs and flows of Sunday here at Pebble?  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, it was really, really difficult. The wind picked up kind of the end of that front nine, and I was hanging on there, and a few poor drives that I didn't think were too bad but ended up in bad spots and just tried to manage my way from there. And 14's such a difficult hole, once I made double there I had to settle myself down and know that I still had a two-shot lead. And then obviously, chip-in the next hole and get one shot back was massive.   
 Q.  What were the emotions like playing alongside Phil while you try to get back in the winner's circle a second time?  
NICK TAYLOR: It was great to play with Phil. He was awesome all day. Our amateur partners were really fun. I felt like it was pretty relaxed. I was actually probably more nervous before the round than when I was playing. So yeah, I made a few putts early and that settled me down and it was nice to get off to a good start.   
 Q.  Six years between victories on the PGA TOUR, what did you prove to yourself today?  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I guess I can do it. You never know when that one break happens. I had to battle for my card the last few years, I think some of those rounds to keep my card helped me today for sure. It was huge days and it just gives me great confidence moving forward.   
 Q.  What did it mean to have your family behind the green when it was over?  
NICK TAYLOR: It was amazing. When I won at Sanderson my wife wasn't there and to have her here now and with my son it's an incredible feeling.
