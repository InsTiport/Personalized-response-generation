 Q.  Nick, you followed up a 66 yesterday with a 65 today.  Two of your best consecutive rounds on Tour.  What was cooking for you?  
NICK TAYLOR: The putter was really solid, kind of within ten feet the last two days and especially today, and made a lot of putts for par that kept the round going especially on my back-9.   
Just kind of each day seemed the back-9 I kind of found a swing and hit some good shots but it was kind of just kind of got around and scored well last couple of days.  It was nice.   
 Q.  What is it like out there today?  It seems like perfect conditions.  
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah.  With the rain it was a little softer so you can get after some pins, you have a good yardage.  Lot of tough pins.  If you go after them and short-side yourself, it's tough to make par.  It's getable.  There's a bunch of birdies in our group but it's easy to make bogies out there as well.   
 Q.  Have you looked at the leaderboard yet, did you see that your buddy, Joel Dahmen is right there next to you, he's still out on the course.  
 What is it like see him playing well, too, you're a former Washington roommate?   
NICK TAYLOR: It's great.  He's had a difficult year getting starts.  I hope he can finish it off.  Couple of great holes coming in.  Hope he can finish it off.   
 Q.  Have you given him any tips, helped him out on the PGA TOUR?  
NICK TAYLOR: We play a lot of practice rounds together.  This week we haven't.  Maybe we'll keep that going.  Maybe I'm giving bad advice.   
 Q.  It seemed to be working for you today.  Thank you for your time and congrats on another great week.  
NICK TAYLOR: Thanks very much.
