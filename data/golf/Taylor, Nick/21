Q. I know you didn't finish the way you wanted to there, but could you tell me a little bit about your round and how you feel playing here at this course given your history here?
NICK TAYLOR: Hit it really well kind of starting the fourth hole on.  Made a few putts, but was just kind of solid.  18 was playing tough a little today.  It was obviously at the back tees, so it was tough and I hit actually a good second shot and just clipped the tree.  It was a short, tough up-and-down.  Yeah, I'm happy with how I played and could have rolled in a few more putts, but rolling pretty solid.  Like I greens that are here, like obviously the shapes of the holes, and it just kind of Fitz my eye.
Q. How did you play here last year?
NICK TAYLOR: I played pretty well.  I finished 20th, but I was playing decent the final round just didn't finish great.  I played better than 20th, but definitely looking forward to having a good tournament again.
Q. So when you come back to a place like this how much does that factor in the way you think you will play?  Does it help that much?
NICK TAYLOR: I think it gives you some positive mojo, knowing obviously if I played well here twice that I kind of like the look of the golf course, and I've read the greens well in the past obviously.  With that being said, you still have to play well, but obviously I feel comfortable here, so that definitely helps.
