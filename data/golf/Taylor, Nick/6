  NICK TAYLOR: I'm a little tired. It was frustrating. Okay golf. Pretty bad result, but I loved being out here. I tried to soak up every moment. So I'll try to take some positives. 

Q. What did you learn about Augusta National? 
NICK TAYLOR: You know, if you hit it out of position then put it somewhere on the green but in the right position, you've got a chance to make pars and each hole. It's really fun trying to use slopes. I probably didn't play it to its true test with being how soft it is, but I did enjoy the challenge of it. Greens got me this week, but yeah, it was a lot of fun. 

Q. Just your overall experience, how would you sum it up? 
NICK TAYLOR: Any time you're at Augusta National, it's a great week. I hope to be back and get the full experience at some point, but for what it is, this is all I know, so it was great.
