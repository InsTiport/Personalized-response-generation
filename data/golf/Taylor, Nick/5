Q. Let's start with today's round, how you felt Sunday at Augusta National. 
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, it was I guess not what I envisioned teeing off first on 10, but I had a great pairing. It was fun just to ask stories of those guys. They've been in contention a lot around this place, so that was pretty cool. I played decent. I played some sloppy mistakes like I have kind of all week around the greens, but I played better to make up for it. Overall it was a decent day. 

Q. What do you take away from your week here? 
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, my game I feel like got better every day. Not necessarily score but definitely hitting better shots. Squeaked in the cut; that was definitelyââ leaving Friday night I thought it was more likely to miss than actually make it, so I was really happy to make the cut. I knew my game was kind of trending in the right direction, and it was great to play with Weirsie yesterday and not only play with him in a practice round but the tournament. It was pretty special, and I played well. All in all, it was a really good week. 

Q. Are the scores about what you thought they'd be like? What's the takeaway from that? 
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I've heard from a lot of people. It's definitely softer than it normally is. I hope to be back here as soon as possible to get the real Augusta National. I'm sure a lot of the members would tell me that. But overall it was an amazing experience, getting here early on Sunday, getting to play the course so many times. I loved every second of it, so it was awesome. 

Q. As you go to another tournament, or the next tournament, will it feel a little bit different after you've played here? 
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, I'm sure. After any major, the next week is going to feel a little different, but yeah, this week was amazing. I'll leave it at that. I'll be ready to go next Thursday when we start. But I tried to enjoy every moment out here. There's so many special areas like Amen Corner and so many times that you look around and just kind of pinch yourself. Yeah, I tried to soak it up as much as I could. 

Q. It's not quite the end of the year for you but it's pretty close. How would you sum up this year? 
NICK TAYLOR: Yeah, it's been different. It feels like two different years. I'm sure a lot for everybody. I feel like my game was peaking, winning at Pebble and going the right direction, then taking a break, I didn't expect to come out lights out, but I hoped for better results. But I feel like, again, it's going the right direction. I'm excited about next week. Hopefully give it my all and have a good finish and be ready for the holidays.
