Q.  Tell me about your match today.
A.J. EATHORNE:  It was good.  I actually played a lot better today.  I hit the ball a lot better.  Unfortunately, I didn't putt as well as I wanted to.  I was right around the cup for the first nine holes and I didn't make anything.  That got a little frustrating.  I got mad at myself after 8 and 3 putted a couple of times and just missed short ones.  I ended up hanging in there and I hung in there long enough, and it's a good thing.
Q.  Were you down at any point?
A.J. EATHORNE:  I was down going into 12, she made a birdie on 12.  13, I row rolled in about a 15 , 20 footer, and I got it back to even.  Then she hit into the sand on the next hole, and I managed to 2 putt for par and got 1 up.

The next hole, I made a long bomb about 25, 30 feet on 15.  That kind of got me fired up.  I was to up.  She made a birdie on the next hole.  I made a good up and down for four, but she made birdie to get one back.

She made a great up and down on 17 to extend the match and take it to 18.  I played smart down the middle on the green and 2 putted.
Q.  Were you proud to represent Canada today?
A.J. EATHORNE:  Yes, especially on Canada Day.  I wore my Canadian tattoos, and Canadians are always loyal to the players and we're loyal to the fans.
