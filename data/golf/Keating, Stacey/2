Q.   So you were high on the leaderboard most of the day, obviously dropped a shot at the end but you must be pretty happy with that?
STACEY KEATING:   Yeah, exactly.   I hit in a pot bunker on the last and had to take my medicine and that's the way it goes.   I was happy with how the day went. 

Q.   These conditions, people say they are basically benign compared to the rest of the week?
STACEY KEATING:   Yeah, especially we teed off at like   8.30, so we had some really good conditions, I think it will be a different story tomorrow but I'm glad I made the most of it.

Q.   What were the key heights to your round today? 
STACEY KEATING:   The first was a tough opening hole and I hit a 5‑wood to about eight feet and holed it so it's always nice to start with a birdie.   I had a few about birdie chances and a couple good saves, like up‑and‑downs on par 3s.   Yeah, just a dropped shot at the last but hey, that happens. 

Q.   Do you like links golf? 
STACEY KEATING:   I do, actually.   I think it's very exciting golf.   Like you can hit a great shot and get a bad bounce but you can hit a bad shot and get away with it, so I think it is, it's very exciting, exciting golf.   And I think coming from Melbourne, we play a lot of courses that can be quite firm and fast. 

Q.   Does it remind you of home? 
STACEY KEATING:   A bit, not the conditions. 

Q.   Which course does it remind you of most?
STACEY KEATING:   I guess we have not played proper links, links since this time last year.   Just a one‑off. 

Q.   So you feel good for the weekend now, you have no expectations? 
STACEY KEATING:   Yeah, still, the same.   I have afternoon tee off tomorrow so I know it's going to be a lot tougher than it was out there this morning.   I know I made the most of the nice conditions and we'll see how it goes tomorrow.   A long way to go.
