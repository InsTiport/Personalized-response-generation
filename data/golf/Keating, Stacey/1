 Q.   Stacy, we understand you've had seven hole‑in‑ones now.   What did it feel like to see your ball go in the hole?  
STACY KEATING:   It's good.   It's nice to know I don't have to putt, isn't it.   It was nice.   It was a good shot, too.   Yeah, it was even better.  
   
 Q.   And overall for the tournament, puts you in a good position.   
STACY KEATING:   Yeah, I guess I didn't do much apart from that.   I guess that makes it a little exciting.   Yeah, I hit it good.   
   
 Q.   7‑iron?   
STACY KEATING:   It was a 7‑iron.   It was good.   
   
 Q.   This is your seventh hole‑in‑one, but have you ever won anything for those?   
STACY KEATING:   Nothing apart from I think a Teddy bear.   I was a little disappointed to not see anything, but it's always nice to see a 1 on the scorecard.   Would have been nice‑‑ what's the car, 15?
