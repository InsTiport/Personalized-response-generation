Q.  What were the course conditions like today?
WAYNE LEVI:  I think that as much trouble as there is out there and the wind conditions and that, the greens I think are a little too firm.
Q.  Do you think it was an advantage playing this afternoon?
WAYNE LEVI:  No, heck no, it wasn't.  It was, any time you play in the morning here, it's, the course is softer and it's just more receptive for driving the ball and hitting your second shots in there.  And the greens are a little smoother.  So any time you can play early is the time to play.
Q.  Do you have any key shots or highlights of your round today?
WAYNE LEVI:  The chip in on number    I started on the back nine, I think it was like the 12th or 13th hole.

I hit a darn good shot and it rolled over the edge of the green.  And then I chipped it in.  So that kind of got me going.  Instead of maybe bogeying there and I birdie, I got it under and then I had it under par the rest of the day.

And then I just made a double bogey on this short, what is it?  Number 6 or 7.  And that just ruined my round.
