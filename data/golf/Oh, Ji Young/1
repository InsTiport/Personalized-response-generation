Q.   5â€‘under par 67 today.   Tell us about your round?
JI YOUNG OH:   Today really I just kept playing and a really long time.   Today everything is good for me.   I'm really calm.   My shot is really good, so I have a good score today.

Q.   Can you tell us about some of your birdies?   Were they long putts, short putts? 
JI YOUNG OH:   Today I have six birdies, but everything was a short putt, like six feet, like almost like short putt.   So I made a birdie.

Q.   I saw your shot on 17.   It almost went in for eagle.   You must have really been feeling good today? 
JI YOUNG OH:   Yeah, today is a really good feeling today.   Almost the best shot on number 17 today.   Yeah, it's good.

Q.   Can you just tell us about your game right now and how you feel?   You struggled last year, but now you're playing better. 
JI YOUNG OH:   Yeah, a few years ago, last year and then two years ago my hip had a little problem. 
But this year and last year, I just had a new trainer and we just worked a little bit harder and working on a lot of things. 
So my body is a little bit better right now.   So maybe it's really good this week, maybe.

Q.   Which hip, left or right? 
JI YOUNG OH:   The left.   But it's nothing now.   Everything's gone, so it's really good.

Q.   What is your trainer's name? 
JI YOUNG OH:   Max, it's an English name, Max.
