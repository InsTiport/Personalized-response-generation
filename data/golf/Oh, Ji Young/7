   MIKE SCANLAN: You're tied for second place right now. If you would, just talk about your round and how you played today.   
 JI YOUNG OH: Today I felt really good again, and good weather, more warm than yesterday, so everything is good, and it caused really good conditions. And then today I hit the fairways again and the greens, so I made a lot of birdies. Yeah, it's good.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Were you hoping to get another hole-in-one?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah, I hoped No. 15, because there is a par -- but today, no, just birdie.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about, you're, what, 20 now?  
 JI YOUNG OH: 20.   
  
  Q. Talk about thoughts of winning on the Tour.   
 JI YOUNG OH: I'm 20 years old, and young, and there are a lot of players on the LPGA Tour. I'm really happy because I'm young and playing really good right now.   
 I'm young, I'm 20 years old, and I'm happy to have an LPGA win under my belt under. You know, to be honest, I'm happy to be able to compete here on the LPGA Tour.   
 Winning a tournament on the LPGA Tour is never easy, regardless of how many wins you have had in the past, but it certainly means I have more confidence in my game. I know I can get there. So it makes it a little bit easier, yes.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you.
