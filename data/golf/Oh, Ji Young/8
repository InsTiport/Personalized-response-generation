   MIKE SCANLAN: Should we do your scorecard to start? Birdie on 11. 
 JI YOUNG OH: I used a 52, and then four feet, and I made birdie. 
 No. 15, I made a bogey. I used a 5-iron, 170 shot and a little bit over, but I missed a putt, three-putted from 12 feet.
 Birdie on 17, 195, and I used a 7-wood to six feet, and I made a birdie. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey on 1? 
 JI YOUNG OH: 100 shot and then I missed a lot, and then I was in the bunker and then I used a 58, and just two feet and I missed the par putt. 
 Then an eagle on 2. I hit a 52-degree wedge from 112 yards. 

 Q. Did it go straight in or did it bounce? 
 JI YOUNG OH: I can't see because it's a little uphill, so I just hit it, and people said it was just in.
 MIKE SCANLAN: And then you had a birdie on 3? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, I used a utility to 15 yards, and I made a birdie. 
 No. 5, I used a 58, 80-yard shot to six feet and made a birdie. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: And then your hole-in-one on No. 8, you hit a 7-iron from about 140? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes.
 MIKE SCANLAN: Did you see that one? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, just one bounce and in, first time. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Ji Young Oh, congratulations, awesome round. If you would just tell us about your round. How did it go for you? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Today I really, really had good condition in the morning, and everything is right, and then I was a very, very calm. And then I'm really, really happy because today I first time the hole-in-one out and then eagled 2. I was really good with the driver and ball keep hitting the fairway and keep the green, so already made birdie and an eagle hole-in-one. So yeah, it was a good score today. 

 Q. Is this your first ace, first hole-in-one? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, my first time, the hole-in-one. 

 Q. When did you realize the ball was in? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Well, I didn't realize the ball went in, first of all, and I thought I hit the ball pretty close to the pin. But I realized that it went in. 

 Q. What was your first reaction when the ball went in? Were you astounded? 
 JI YOUNG OH: I was speechless at first, and then I was asking my caddie, did you see that ball go in? Did it go in? And then when I found out it actually went in, we started doing high-fives with the caddies and the other players in the group. 

 Q. Just so I understand, you didn't actually see it go in? Did you have to hear the reaction, or how did you actually discern that it went in? 
 JI YOUNG OH: The hole-in-one, I actually did see it go in. It was the eagle that I was talking about that I didn't see it go in. 

 Q. Can you talk about 6-under par, great way to start, kind of cold, damp. Did it take you a while to get warmed up or were you feeling really good today? 
 JI YOUNG OH: In the morning I was a little bit cold because there was a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind and a little bit cold. So I used the hand warmer, and then I just kept my parka. Yes, I'm not cold right now, so really good. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you so much for coming in. Congratulations on a great day. 
 JI YOUNG OH: Thank you so much.
