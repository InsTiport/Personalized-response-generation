 JASON TAYLOR: Okay, and then a bogey on 17.   
 JI YOUNG OH: I hit a 6-iron a little short. So I had a good chip shot, and I putt two to three feet.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay, we'll open it up for questions.   
  
  Q. When you missed that putt on 17, were you aware that Yani had birdied 16 and it was kind of like a two-shot situation where you were a shot behind? Were you aware that maybe you were a shot behind then?   
 JI YOUNG OH: I have no idea because I never see the scoreboard. So I don't know. I just finished up and my caddie said you're behind Yani Tseng, so, yeah, I just know that.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like you just needed to par 18, or did you feel like I really need to get a birdie here at 18 with the regulation 18?   
 JI YOUNG OH: It's a little bit difficult, number 18. So I just tried to birdie, but, yeah.   
  
  Q. How long was the birdie putt on 18?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Number 18?   
  
  Q. Yeah, not the playoff.  
 JI YOUNG OH: It was 10 yards. To a yard, knocked it in.   
  
  Q. After you finished your round, you stayed on 18. What did you do, were you still calm then?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Earlier myself and Yani were in the same spot, same position at the Mastercard Classic in Mexico. You know, it was nothing different than what I felt then. I was just saying that I was calm and everything was okay.   
  
  Q. Could you talk about your pitch shot on the playoff hole? Looked like the ball was kind of sitting down. Just describe the shot.   
 JI YOUNG OH: It a little bit was little bit difficult just because for Yani's putt is a long one. And if I made it to the hole or across the pin, if I win, I won. So I just try to -- I tried to my focus and I feel just a little bunker shot really, so, yeah, it was.   
  
  Q. For the playoffs, when you got up to the tee on 18 again, were you pretty calm inside, your nerves?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah, not nervous because. I wasn't all that nervous. I started this week from the first day I was playing pretty well with hitting all the shots that I wanted. In addition to that, I've been getting what I would call mental calls from Korea. So I think that calls that I've taken have helped my mental aspect of the game tremendously in this tournament.   
  
  Q. What do you mean by mental calls? I don't understand that.   
 JI YOUNG OH: Just like Tiger and Annika, I work with a sports psychologist. That's what I meant by mental calls.   
  
  Q. This is your first LPGA win. When that putt went in, did it feel like you thought it would feel to be a champion here for the first time as far as excitement? You probably dreamed about doing that a lot. But when you've finally done it, does it feel like you thought it would feel?   
 JI YOUNG OH: It's hard to explain how happy, how satisfied I am right now. Even at the moment that I'm speaking right now I would love to do this interview in English, but my mind is just a total blank right now.   
 You know, I apologize for that. But, yeah, it feels great. It feels great. But once again, I'm totally blank.   
  
  Q. How old were you when you first started thinking about coming to the United States and playing on the LPGA Tour? When did that become a goal or a dream for you to come here and play with Se Ri and people like that?   
 JI YOUNG OH: I first started playing golf right at the time when Se Ri won her first U.S. Women's Open. So from the very first moment I picked up the clubs I wanted to come to the LPGA and play with the best. I'm glad I could do what I set out to do, and I would love to continue to follow in the footsteps of Se Ri as far as possible.   
  
  Q. The U.S. Open winner - I heard that you were classmates in high school. Is that correct information?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes.   
  
  Q. How long did you study together?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Just five months together. Because she's gone to U.S. So just five months together in the class.   
  
  Q. Did you discuss to become a professional golfer in the United States at that time?   
 JI YOUNG OH: No, never talked.
