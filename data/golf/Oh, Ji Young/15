   MIKE SCANLAN: Ji Young thank you very much for coming in today. You're even par for the tournament and there's only one person below par, Paula  Creamer, ahead of you. 
Can you just talk about how you played today. 
 JI YOUNG OH: (From translation.) The wind was, in my opinion, was blowing a different direction. This was actually an opposite direction as it was yesterday. And I bogeyed the same holes that I bogeyed yesterday, so I was a little bit shaken up. And it was a little more difficult. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Knowing that you are in second place going into the weekend, how do you feel about your chances to win this tournament? 
 JI YOUNG OH: (From translation.) Well I don't know if I can say that I could win this tournament, but, you know, I had several chances this year to win tournaments, but I wasn't able to capitalize on that. So this tournament I'm really looking forward to my first win. And I will really try hard to win this tournament. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: If the wind isn't as strong tomorrow, will you be more confident that you'll make more birdies? 
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you tell us a little bit more about how you have been playing this year. Are you feeling confident in your game? 
 JI YOUNG OH: (From translation.) Well, as you know, I am playing better than I did last year. 
 I'm much more confident in my game. So, yes, I am playing better this year. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. Anything else? 
Thanks for coming in. 
 JI YOUNG OH: Thank you.
