   THE MODERATOR: Can you tell us a little bit about your round? You started fairly early, so the conditions were a little bit easier?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah I started really early, so wind, a little bit in the morning, and so lucky. Today the conditions were pretty good and my swing is good and rhythm is good. Yeah, everything is going right and I tried with my focus, too.   
 Yeah, I had good scores today.   
 THE MODERATOR: How many birdies?   
 JI YOUNG OH: I have six birdies and two bogeys.  
 THE MODERATOR: And the greens are rolling very well? You just had wonderful putting today.  
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, the greens are not bad, and a little bit maybe slow, but it's fine conditions.   
 THE MODERATOR: Is this your first trip to China?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, first time.   
 THE MODERATOR: How do you see the course, the whole conditions and everything?   
 JI YOUNG OH: The course is really, really good. And in the winter time, I'm going to Malaysia and Taiwan and almost same conditions. Yeah, it's pretty good and I like the course.   
  
  Q. (Have much better are you this year)?  
 JI YOUNG OH: This year, I've played really, really good, better than last year, and everything is going right, and I am playing better than last year, getting the driver more in the fairway and the putter, too. I think everything is better right now.   
  
  Q. We see a lot of players from Korea on the LPGA and also the Asian Tour, almost everywhere, you see a lot of Korean LPGA players. Can you tell us what the secret is, why there are so many players everywhere, and doing so well?   
 JI YOUNG OH: I don't know, that's right, everywhere it's Korean, even in China and Japan, too. Golf is a good sport.   
 I don't know (laughing). Sorry, I have no idea.   
  
  Q. If you look at the conditions like today, do you think 4- or 5-under will be a pretty good score to come into the clubhouse and be a leader?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah, today I think is a really good score.   
 But I started with a bogey, 1-over to start. The start was not a good one, but I had a lot of birdies on the back nine. So, yeah, everything is good, and it was all right.   
  
  Q. Is it easier on the back? You had three birdies on the back.   
 JI YOUNG OH: I like the back nine. I have more birdie chances, so more birdies on the back nine, so more better score.   
  
  Q. Are you all staying together during the week in the hotel or do you go into the town at all?   
 JI YOUNG OH: No, I'm just in the hole he will. The first Monday, I had managed my foot, which was really, really good.   
  
  Q. In the hotel?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So you haven't seen the town yet?  
 JI YOUNG OH: Maybe Sunday night, because I leave in the morning, Monday in the morning. So maybe I will go to downtown maybe Sunday night.  
  
  Q. Celebrate?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah, Sunday.   
  
  Q. So normally during the week, it's just hotel and golf course?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes.   
  
  Q. You don't normally do other things?   
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, just golf course and go to the hotel and restaurant, that's it.   
  
  Q. How long have you stayed in the U.S. so far, how many years?   
 JI YOUNG OH: I'm just two years.   
  
  Q. And did you play on the FUTURES Tour?   
 JI YOUNG OH: No.   
  
  Q. And you went straight from the Korean Tour?  
 JI YOUNG OH: Yes, I was an amateur in Korea, and then two years ago, I came here to the USA and I just transferred over.   
  
  Q. And your English, compared to most of the Korean players, are you probably above average, would you say?  
 JI YOUNG OH: Yeah.   
  
  Q. So you feel more comfortable talking to the media and everybody?   
 JI YOUNG OH: My English is a little bit bad --  
  
  Q. Oh, no, no, it's great.   
 JI YOUNG OH: It's bad but every day, I run to English, and every day, so maybe more.
