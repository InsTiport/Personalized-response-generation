 Q.  Talk a little bit about your round today.  
BOHYUN PARK: Well, I was hitting the ball good, and today my putting worked out pretty good, so I think that's what put me to a lot of birdies.  Hitting into the rough was tough, but I hit it out good, just made a couple up-and-downs.   
 Q.  On your front nine did you have four birdies out of five holes?  Talk about that stretch.  
BOHYUN PARK: Yeah.  Well, I think I was going good, and my putting just went in the hole consistently.   
 Q.  What do you think was your longest birdie putt?  
BOHYUN PARK: Longest birdie putt was about like four and 20 feet.   
 Q.  Were you in the Girls' Junior?  
BOHYUN PARK: No.   
 Q.  What have you done this summer so far?  
BOHYUN PARK: So far I've just played AJGA tournaments.  I've won the Jordan Spieth before this, and then after that I just was trying to prepare for the tournament.   
 Q.  How does the course fit your eye, fit your game?  
BOHYUN PARK: Yeah, the course was very good, and the greens, they weren't that fast or slow, and it was slower than last year, but it was good.   
 Q.  It's a long championship; how do you kind of save your energy, especially in the heat?  
BOHYUN PARK: Just try and stay in the shade as much as possible and drink lots of water and just don't overheat yourself.
