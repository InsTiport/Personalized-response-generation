Q.   Your thoughts on the round? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   It was a grind.   Obviously the first few holes, I really had to grind, good up‑and‑downs.   Very good putting today. 
Yeah, on 18, just misjudged it.   The third shot unfortunately cost me a couple of shots but overall, I played great, great week.   Played really good golf and very happy going into the hope now.

Q.   Does is it give consolation and confidence the very fact that you are competitive right down the wire?
MARTIN KAYMER:   My plan was really not to play at the beginning because I needed to, I thought I needed to practise a little bit more to get ready for The Open but that was the best preparation I could have had, especially playing in the last few groups today.

Q.   Gets the juices going, as well and makes you feel competitive. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I'm really looking forward to play golf at the moment in general.   It has not really worked out the way it should be or the way it should work out.   Put a lot of practise in there and finally I think everything is coming together, and I think just at the right time because we have big tournaments coming up.

Q.   You've touched on this in previous days, but what is it about this place that makes good preparation? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   First of all, it's a very challenging golf course.   Obviously it can play very fast and very firm, so all those things, it's a good combination of a tough golf course. 
Also, you need to be brave at certain holes to go for some flags or to make birdies and in major championships, you do need the same in order to give it a chance on Sunday.   So I come here every year, and I think it's one of the best preparations you can have.
