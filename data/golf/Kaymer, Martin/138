 Q.   How would you sum up the two days?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Very difficult.   For me it was cleared I struggled on the golf course.   In the past I haven't been that successful here and I think this week, it was a big step for me to accept that you have golf courses that you don't‑‑ that don't suit your play, that don't suit your eye a lot, and then I struggled a lot on the greens.   
So it's okay for me.   I don't try to talk too much into it.   It is what it is and I did my very best and level par was the best I could do.  
   
 Q.   And hence the degree of disappointment isn't as bad than if it was on a course you really favoured if you really wanted the championship as much perhaps.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think you can only be disappointed if your expectations are high.   But my expectations are not very high, because I knew‑‑ I like a golf course where you have to scramble and you have to hit really good golf shots and where even par, 1‑ or 2‑under par is a good score, and that's not the golf course.   
So I knew that it is not my favourite, but obviously you try your very best to make it to something positive.   But I struggled.   There was never really momentum on my side.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like France next week, Le Golf National?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I look forward to that week.   It's a very good golf course and I've been successful there.   I think it's one of the best golf courses we play on The European Tour.   It's fun.   The fans are great in France.   Just good memories, so I look forward to drive there.   That's the nice thing, I can drive in my car, it's only four and a half hours.   So I look forward to The French Open.
