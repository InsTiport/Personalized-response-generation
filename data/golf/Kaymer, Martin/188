 Q.   Assessment of your first round?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I played well, but for some reason, I said it to Greg already, that I was a little nervous.   I don't know why.   I guess the first one is the toughest, and then you're in it and then it's okay.   But I hit a lot of good shots today.   I had an eagle on 13.   It was a great second shot, nice putt, and all of a sudden I was 2‑up, and it was very nice, with only five holes to go.   
So generally playing well.  
   
 Q.   Can you put your finger on the nerves?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, it was very strange.   I never had that before, so I don't think it will stay like this.   But I haven't played tournaments for two weeks, and then I practiced a lot and my expectations were very high.   One of those days, I don't know.   But I'm happy that I won.  
   
 Q.   It's just been a weird couple of days?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   That's actually true.   It was strange to get the first round over with, so now I'm glad, and I'll practice a little bit.  
   
 Q.   A word on the course and the conditions?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Conditions were fine.   You could be very aggressive, which was nice, because the greens are very tricky, and if you have even mid‑irons you can go very aggressive because they don't jump away.
