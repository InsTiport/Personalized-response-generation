Q. What a fantastic performance, my legs are shaking, can't imagine what it's like for you guys.  How did that feel for you?MARTIN KAYMER: It was very exciting.  Obviously we had our chances.  When we walked up 18, I said to Justin, we deserve at least half a point, so let's put it on the green and make the putt for three.  But then obviously we made a great up-and-down from the bunker to win the hole.Q. An incredible performance from the two rookies that you finally managed to stop; how does that feel?JUSTIN ROSE: Feels good.  They have had a great Ryder Cup, and that match was certainly there for the taking from both teams to be honest with you, but we caught a break there.  They got a poor lie on 18 which I'm sure they are going to be disappointed about. But my man here fought hard all day.  Foursomes can be like that; when you don't get your rhythm going, it can be a tough day out there and we worked hard for our half point today.
