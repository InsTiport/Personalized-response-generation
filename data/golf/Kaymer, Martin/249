   MARTIN KAYMER: It was okay. I struggled a little bit on the front nine. I was 4-over after nine holes, and I just tried to keep it together. That was my goal, to shoot under par on the back nine. You know, I shot 1-under par on the back nine, but still, it was a little bit -- I three-putted 17. It was a little unnecessary. But overall it was an okay week. I think I'm on a good way to perform well soon.
