 Q.  Obviously not how you want to finish on 18 there, but all in all you had a good round.  Do you leave with a bad taste in your mouth or do you feel good about what you did today?  
MARTIN KAYMER: No, I feel very good because I drove the ball very well.  Hit good golf shots, very solid strikes.  18 is not the best way to finish with a wedge in your hand.  But it's a tricky course sometimes and I just didn't hit a good shot in.  So I have to accept it and take positives out of the day and even from yesterday.  3-under par in a major championship is never really bad.  I'm only four shots behind.   
We have poor weather coming in tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're right there.  So the mindset going into tomorrow, be aggressive or just go out and play golf and stick with the game plan?  
MARTIN KAYMER: My experience from majors, you can't really be aggressive on Friday or Saturday.  You have to wait for the back nine on Sunday if you're only three or four shots behind.   
Tomorrow same game plan as today, stick to hitting fairways, creating chances.  If it happens, you shoot a low score, great.  If not, you've got to wait until Sunday.  If it doesn't happen Sunday, it wasn't your week.   
 Q.  Knowing you were able to do it before, do you still draw on Pinehurst and what you were able to get done there?  
MARTIN KAYMER: I think Pinehurst and Sawgrass.  Sawgrass was a huge win for me, especially the way I played there.  Pinehurst was very different because I played extremely good on Thursday, Friday, and then mentally I did it extremely well over the weekend.  So it was a great achievement overall.   
On the other hand, it's a totally different golf course.  It's a strong leaderboard, and I really enjoy being up there.  If you shoot a good score tomorrow, it's going to be a great Sunday, and that is what we all play for.
