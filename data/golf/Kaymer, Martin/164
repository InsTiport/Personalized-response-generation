 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MARTIN KAYMER:   It was a really good start, first time I give myself chances, unfortunately couldn't make the eagle on 17 when it was be only 5 to 6 feet, another makeable eagle chance on 15, but overall I'm hitting the ball really well.   It was a little bit of a pity to finish bogey, bogey, but it's okay, you know.   
They are very difficult holes and could have been also par, par; it was very close to it.   It was just an unfortunate thing, 17, 18, but it's okay.   
   
 Q.   Seemed like there was one young fan on 15 that was just as dismayed as you were.   I think you probably heard a little bit of that.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, it was a girl screaming for quite some time.   You know, usually you hear some roars if you miss it, for 1 or 2 seconds, but she kept going and it was funny.   
It's important if you stay calm on the golf course and relax and that was a funny situation so why not go with it.   
   
 Q.   You took it very well.   Going into tomorrow you're still obviously feeling good about your game despite the finish.   The way this course is playing, what number needs to be shot tomorrow to come away with the championship?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's very tough to say, because you could shoot 9 or 10‑under par, what we have seen in the last couple of days, and I think the weather is going to be the same; the pins they might be a little more difficult, but I think I have to go very low tomorrow.   I don't know where the leader is now but I think I'm four, five shots behind so I think you need something in the 8, 9‑under area to have a chance tomorrow.
