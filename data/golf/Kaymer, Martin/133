Q. (Inaudible.)MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, it was a mixed bag, I'm afraid.  Good stuff and some scrappy stuff.  I found the rough a couple of times that I hadn't experienced up until now, which is, you know, inevitable.  But after the rain kind of eased up, sort of five or six holes in, no problems.Q. (Inaudible.)MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, absolutely.  Well, apparently according to the guy in the car on the way back to the clubhouse, everywhere around us is getting wet, but we're not.  Lucky.Q. (Inaudible.)MARTIN KAYMER: I need to go to the driving range and fix a couple of things that let me down today.  Can't wait.  Hopefully the sun will be out.  The crowds will be back.  Obviously brilliant crowds today, but given the weather and the two-tee starts, it's been a bit difficult for everyone.  But tomorrow is going to be fantastic.  And I think the weather is set fair, so bring it on.
