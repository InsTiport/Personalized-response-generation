MARTIN KAYMER: I put myself in great position after ten holes.  Was not the finish I was looking for, but overall I'm heading to the right direction and that is the most important, especially for that upcoming summer now.   
 Q.  Presumably there's a lot of excitement when you're making those gains and closing the gap, albeit that is just changed effectively on one hole.  
MARTIN KAYMER: It's exciting that I really had a chance to -- I mean, in the end now, not to win, but to finish second.  So it was nice to be in that position.  Didn't quite finish it off in the end, but overall, I'm not too worried about it.   
I got a little tight in the end, especially with the putts, a couple putts here and there.  I know the reasons, and that's the most important for the next two weeks.   
 Q.  Elaborate on what you said; that it's important weeks to come, and finding some form for them?  
MARTIN KAYMER: They are big tournaments.  Obviously this one here started off a nice summer, a lot of World Ranking points to play for, a lot of Ryder Cup points, which was obviously for me, is very, very important.  And now Scottish Open that I've won before, it's obviously an event that I like to play, and then we top it off with the highlight at The Open.
