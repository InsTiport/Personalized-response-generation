 Q. Out in level par today, back in a fabulous 4-under 33; what was the key to that back nine?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I made a lot of putts. I was playing solid, hit a lot of fairways, so gave myself good birdie chances, and I finally could make the putts today. 
 18 was a bad putt, but besides that, my putting was really strong.

 Q. Give us a sense of how that back nine is playing; is it there for the taking? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, you have three par 5s. If you can use them, you can shoot a low score. But obviously the wind picked up a little bit. So it's most important that you place the ball in the fairway on the par 5s so you can get home in two, otherwise you are struggling to make birdies.

 Q. These three rounds you've played, your scores come down every day; does it feel like you're playing better each day?
 MARTIN KAYMER: The first day I played very solid, just had a double-bogey on No. 9. But I feel pretty good. Obviously like I said earlier, my putting was good today. If I can sneak in a few more tomorrow, I might have a chance. 

 Q. What's the approach tomorrow going out, probably a few shots behind? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I think depending on how they finished today, because they still have the back nine to play, I'll probably play a little more aggressive tomorrow, go for a few more flags, a few more pins, and see what happens.
