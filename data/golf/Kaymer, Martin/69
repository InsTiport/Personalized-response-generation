 Q.  That's a fast finish to get the job done.  Sensational finish.  Describe the match.  
MARTIN KAYMER: It was a sensational finish, but the rest was very average, I would say.  I didn't hit many fairways today.  I couldn't really get the driver going, but I stayed into the game.  We gave each other way too many chances.  Both of us had chances to really close the match on 14 and 15.  Shane had a huge putt on 15 to go 2-up.  Then possibly I made a great birdie on 16.  So very pleased with the finish.   
 Q.  You found your game when it mattered.  There were clutch shots under pressure.  Is that what's most pleasing about this result?  
MARTIN KAYMER: It's difficult to describe how much I love that pressure, because you don't get it anywhere else.  You get it when you try to win tournaments.  When you are in contention after nine holes, you have to feel it.  In match play it can come up every single day and that is such a beauty.  You can't practice it and you need to adjust in the situation.
