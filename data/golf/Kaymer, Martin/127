Q. I just would like your thoughts about playing with Thomas in the second pairing and how exciting that's going to be.MARTIN KAYMER: You know, Thomas and me, we get along very well.  He helped me a lot in 2010 already, when I played The Ryder Cup, because he saw and he felt that I didn't feel that comfortable. Then the last Ryder Cup we played, he was helping me a lot as well.  So he was one of the first who called me when I won the U.S. Open.  So it's a very special relationship we have.  I think he's a very, very nice guy and I see him as kind of a mentor.  There's a lot to learn from him.  I just enjoy his company. The group that we have tomorrow is a tough one, I think, because Rickie is a good match-play player.  Jimmy Walker, obviously he's a rookie, but that doesn't mean much.Q. You and Thomas, when you knew you were going to be on the team, did you talk about playing together?MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, actually before we even qualified, we said we have to make the team so we can play with each other.  I would like to play with you, I told him, many times.  He was on the team earlier than me.  I just needed to make sure to be on the team. And after the U.S. Open, when he called me, I said maybe we get paired and we can play together.  It goes back to maybe a year, year and a half
