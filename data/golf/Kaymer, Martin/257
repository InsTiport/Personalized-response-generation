 Q. How would you describe your round today? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: So much better than yesterday. My ball-striking was very good. I was hitting a lot of fairways. My driving felt good. My irons, they were very precise, good distance control. I just need to make more putts.

 Q. How is the course holding up after the rain yesterday?
 MARTIN KAYMER: No problems at all. It's similar to how it played yesterday. The greens are still fine. Obviously short, there's plenty of chances, the greens are just tricky to read.

 Q. 6-under par, do you still feel like you have an excellent chance at winning this event for the second time?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Not excellent, but I think I have a good chance. If I shoot a low score like Henrik did yesterday that obviously is possible here, then I can put myself in contention.

 Q. What sort of number do you reckon you need?
 MARTIN KAYMER: The past few years I think the winning score was around 18-, 20-under par, and now I'm 6 and Henrik is 10, so I think it will be similar, 18-, 20-under.

 Q. If 20-under is the number then, obviously the way you're playing you feel like you can achieve that?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I struck it well. As I said, I just need to give myself more chances to make putts. I've shot 9-under here already, so I need one of those the next two days.
