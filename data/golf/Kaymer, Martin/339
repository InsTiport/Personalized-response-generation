 Q. A bit of an up-and-down day. How do you feel about 71 overall?
 MARTIN KAYMER: It's an okay start. I was expecting a lot more of myself today. But you know, 1-under par is a good score, so I think I'm mid 20s right now, and three days to go. 
 So it's a marathon this week, anyways. Everybody wants to win here, especially the first three or four guys. But I think I started very well. 

 Q. We know you had the injury with the foot. Are you fully fit now?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Maybe 90 per cent, but it doesn't really even bother my golf swing. 

 Q. What about this golf course, first competitive round you've played, how do you like it?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, the golf course is very exciting. I think the first nine holes, it's pretty simple golf. You always hit driver or 3-wood, because it's always a bunker in the middle of the fairway, so that's pretty simple. 
 But the back nine is a little bit more interesting. A lot of slopes on the greens, and especially right now where we played, we played really late. So the greens got really bumpy in the afternoon, which was a tough one to save some pars or make some good birdies. But at the end of the day, I think it was a good golf course that we were playing on.
