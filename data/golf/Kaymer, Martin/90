 Q.   It was not to be.   Sad that I have to do the interview, because I feel sorry for you.   How do you feel, home championship and all?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Are of course it's very disappointing, especially on the last hole, the last three or four holes, gave myself very good chances.   I hit a lot of edges today, as well.   I hit good putts but the ball didn't want to go in.   
18 was not the best tee shot but was hoping to get a little bit of favour but I think in the end of the day, I think too many people got involved and then it's always tough.   
   
 Q.   That must be tough.   But The Rules of Golf are The Rules of Golf and you know that.   You're a fair player, you've been there, done that.   So you feel as though you were hard done by there?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's tough to say.   For me, I couldn't see the ball‑‑ where it crossed the water, I lost it in the air because of all the trees, they were in the air.   In the end of the day it was up to the camera guys, and they were not sure, and obviously then they have to decide for the worst case, and the worst case was to go back.  
   
 Q.   Let's move on to the positives, not to be this week and not last week.   Where is the game at?   Where do you feel you're going?   Do you feel as though the game is in good shape?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's 50/50.   Yesterday I played the first nine very well, the back nine not so good.   Today, the first nine not so good and the back nine very well.   So it's right on the line at the moment.
