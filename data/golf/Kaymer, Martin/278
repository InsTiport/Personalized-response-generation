 Q. Just a comment on your round today? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I had a fantastic start with three birdies, and then I played very, very solid golf. My putting was good. I hit a lot of fairways but to be honest, you know, it was not that difficult today. You can see the scores, a bunch of people are under par and a bunch of people are 3- , 4-under par so, it doesn't seem that difficult. 

 Q. Can you take us through the birdies, the first three? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, the first hole, I hit it in the bunker and made a great up-and-down from there. 
 Second hole, I hit it to probably four feet. 
 Third hole, I had probably like a 12-footer for birdie and then the other birdies were just I made great putts.
