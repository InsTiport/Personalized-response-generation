 Q.   Martin, a morning out on the golf course, first round, a golf course that was there to be had, how do you sum your day for us?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   A little disappointing.   I made only two birdies, which is not bad on the golf course.   I didn't drive the ball very well, so I missed a lot of fairways, and that was the reason I didn't couldn't have a lot of birdie chances.   
It's a shame.   The greens are not as fast as they were in the past.   They are usually very good. It's tough to make birdies and tough to make putts.  
   
 Q.   You're a local boy, this area's favourite son; how much pressure is to play in front of your own people?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's actually less, compared to the U.S. Open, that was definitely more pressure than here.   The U.S. Open is definitely a very, very important and big tournament.   Here this tournament, I enjoy the week.   I played with Marcel.   He had a very good day.   He had three chipâ€‘ins, good putting today.   So it was nice to see him playing well here.   
   
 Q.   You live very close to here and grew up around here; how often did you play here as a youngster?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I couldn't really afford to play here to be honest.   When I was young, I didn't play very often.   The last time I played here was for the tournament, that was pretty much the only time I played that golf course, and now, I've got invited, now I can play.   
   
 Q.   I reckon you can just about afford to play here now and you can probably buy the place, but the thing is, what do you do now?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I didn't really sleep last night.   I slept only two hours, so I probably got to take it easy this afternoon, hit a few balls, half an hour with my coach, he's here, and then try to sleep.  
   
 Q.   What about 64 tomorrow?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Sounds good.
