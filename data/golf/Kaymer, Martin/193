  MARTIN KAYMER:   Got lucky one with shot and made eagle   on a par 4, and then it was very difficult to make putts.   The greens are a little of a struggle this week, and obviously in the afternoon they don't get better but overall 4‑under is a good score. 

Q.   Tell us about the eagle. 
    MARTIN KAYMER:   The hit tee shot in the first cut on the right and had a perfect yardage, pitched pretty much straight at the hole, six, seven yards in front, hit the flag and went in.   So quite a nice start. 

Q.   The kind of thing that can kick‑start a round, isn't it? 
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, you would think so, but then I used the hand brake a little bit.   I just kept making pars and it was okay.   I hit the ball a lot better than last week and better greens on the morning, get some more birdie chances.

Q.   With the greens, it's just the nature of all the traffic over them during the day, is it? 
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Hope so, but I think in general they are not as good as the previous years, that's just how it is.   And obviously when you play in the afternoon, the grass grows and especially grass like this, it's very hard and it gets tough.
