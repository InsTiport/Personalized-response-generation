Q. Bogey, bogey start, and then four birdies in the last six.  Take us through what happened there?
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, the first two holes, you know, two pulls with an iron, first one on the first tee and the second one from on the second hole.  A few missed greens on the golf course.  It's quite tricky sometimes.
But it was really nice coming in, playing really well, giving myself chances, making a few putts.  Hit a fairly easy bunker shot on 17, unfortunately made bogey there.
But overall it was a very solid start to the first round of the U.S. Open.
Q. The way you struck the ball on the birdie holes, was it because you hit it close, or did you make long putts?
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, the first one there was a tap-in from two feet, then the par 5 it was up-and-down from the bunker.  The second one was from the fairway bunker, hit it to maybe 12, 15 feet and made the putt.  So overall it's a good mixture.  Good ball-striking and decent putting.  What I really did at the Memorial.  It was nice to have a round like this today to continue that play.
Q. Does your experience as a winner of the U.S. Open help you when you start out bogey, bogey, and you say, okay, it was only two strokes, it was bogeys, I can still get back in this?
MARTIN KAYMER: Of course it does help you because you know how difficult any major can get.  You will make bogeys, there's no one going to make no bogey on the golf course the four days.  And if you make the two first holes bogey, or 13 and 14, it doesn't really matter.  And that is what I said to myself.  I know I was playing well, I just need to continue that attitude and don't get down on yourself too early in the tournament.
