Q. Great play today and nice to finish in the manner that you did.  How pleased are you with the opening 66?
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I think I played fairly solid all day.  Didn't make many mistakes.  Made one mistake today on the 15th hole and that gave me a bogey on the scorecard, but then I had the nice up-and-down, or I don't know whether you want to call it, chip-in on 16.  That really got the momentum on the right side again.  To finish with three birdies was definitely nice, especially going into tomorrow, and knowing what's all on the line.
Q. Tell us about that.  What is on the line?  Obviously playing this week and next week and the intensity the next couple of weeks.  You have a big goal in mind.
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I haven't missed The Open since 2008.  I haven't qualified this year.  I thought I was because of the U.S. Open win, but I need to have a Top-10 finish this week or next week to catch one of the spots that's still available.  That's why it's nice to start the tournament in a good way.
Q. Continuation of some good form today.  We talked about attitude.  That's been a big thing for you recently the last few months.
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, just cutting all the stuff that didn't matter.  Just saving more energy off the golf course.  Because on the golf course, we know what we have to do and how much energy it takes in order to shoot good scores and deal with all the emotions and whatever comes your way.  So I was just trying to cut off the stuff that is really unnecessary and distracts us from what we are actually trying to achieve and it worked out fairly well.  Created a lot of calmness and joy; joy in what we are doing on the golf course, and that is the way it should be, but we do forget that sometimes.
