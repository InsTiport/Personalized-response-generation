 Q. How would you describe your day? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: I didn't make enough birdies today. I was playing okay the first nine, and I struggled a little bit on 10,11, 12, 13 and 14, but I kept it together, unfortunately made bogey on a reachable par 5, No. 3. But you know, level par is an okay score, and I didn't keep myself out of the tournament, which was important. 

 Q. So that's the positive. What was missing today to get a better result? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: As I was saying, you know, the first five holes are my back nine, so on the front nine, I missed a lot of fairways and I couldn't put myself in good birdie chances, so that was a problem.
 The first five, six holes, they are pretty easy on the golf course, and they are the scoring holes usually.

 Q. A few years ago when you won the tournament, your putting was outstanding. How would you describe it today? How was your putter?
 MARTIN KAYMER: It was okay. The greens are very good, you can hold a lot of putts, you just need to put yourself in position and I didn't do that a lot today, so that's why level par, it's an okay score.
