MARTIN KAYMER: I think I played well.  The golf course didn't play that difficult today.  Overall it would have been nice to avoid the bogey on 17 but overall, 4-under, I think it's a decent start to the event.
I didn't make many mistakes.  I still hit fairways.  I only missed one green, the 17th.  The whole group, we played solid.  Obviously we hit a couple here and there, poor shots; that happens.  But overall we made a few birdies when we needed and that kept the whole group going.  I made a couple birdies in a row on the back nine.  I think one, a bit unexpected on 12, when I missed my tee shot.  But overall, I think I kept the ball in play and that was the key.
Q. A very good approach, the par 5.
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, that was a bit of hit-and-hope.  Obviously the lie was fine.  I know I can get it somewhere close to the green, maybe on to the green, and it rolls up to four, five feet.  That's a bit of luck involved.  It's just very difficult to make putts in the afternoon.  The greens, obviously it was raining a lot, and it was a bit tricky to putt.  Yes, you always expect yourself to make those 4- or 5-footers, but today was a bit different and I think I handled it very well.
