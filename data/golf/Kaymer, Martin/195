Q.   How happy are you with the performance? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's okay.   I wouldn't say I played great.   I putted very well and that kept me in the tournament but overall, I need to hit more fairways.

Q.   Talk about the 5th hole, take us through what happened between yourself and Tiger and the dialogue between the two of you in terms of the embedded ball. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Tiger hit it right of the fairway and then hit it in like the green stuff or whatever and then he called me over and said is it I am bedded‑‑ I think so, he just wanted to check and he checked and it was embedded and then I walked away. 
But then obviously the referee came up to us on 11 and said the sand area was not like normal grass, so he was apparently not allowed to drop it.   I didn't know about it and he obviously didn't know about it, otherwise he wouldn't have done it.   It's an unfortunate thing.

Q.   How did that sit with you?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Obviously he was fighting back a lot, and he was 3‑ or 4‑over par, and trying to make the cut.   He was playing very well coming in.   He was making nice putts in the end, and then I don't know where the cut might be, but I mean, 1‑ or 2‑over, hopefully 2‑over. 

Q.   Did it occur to the two of you to bring in a referee on the 5th hole? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, because embedded, we both thought it was a drop.
