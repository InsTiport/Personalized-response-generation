   MARTIN KAYMER: If you know that you're going to be through anyways, didn't really matter what happened today. You need to find a way to motivate yourself a little bit, and you know, I'm still working on my swing a little bit, and it was a fantastic day today to work a little bit under tournament conditions. But you still want to win. You know I don't really want to lose a match. No one really wants to lose. 
 It was still important if you play against the first or the second of the other group tomorrow. I think Alvaro, he finished first and SÃ¸ren Kjeldsen second, it's always tough to play against a friend; so that's why it was even more important for me to win the match this afternoon. 

 Q. Presumably the more you get into the match, the deeper it goes, the more intense it gets regardless?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Especially I was 1-down early, and I didn't play good golf. I was just not concentrating enough, and then you got kind of like mad at yourself, as well. You want to win. And then you've got a little bit more into it, and in the end I played good golf.

 Q. You mentioned the possibilities, it's not Alvaro tomorrow, it is SÃ¸ren Kjeldsen who has a very tough and considerable resilience about his game. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: It's tough. And we are friends; we have the same manager. So it's going to be a very interesting fight. 
 I think he's a fighter. It doesn't matter if he's 1- or 2-down or 1- or 2-up. He's a fighter, and very good in short game. 
 So it will be interesting tomorrow. But Noh, the guy I played this afternoon against, he was so much longer than me, and I hope that I can hit the ball a little bit longer than Kjeldsen tomorrow.
