  Q 6-under par, nice work so far.  What's been the secret to your performance?
 MARTIN KAYMER:   My putting has been really good the last couple days.  Yesterday, I saved my score a lot.  Ball-striking has been not really like me, so I needed to have something in my game that saved the round, and yesterday was my putting and today was a little bit more solid but short game is quite sharp.
 Q For us, having known you're not feeling like you're at your best and you're in the mix again --  we've been enjoying the last year or so seeing you thrust yourself back up to where we know you belong as a player.  For you having been on this journey, and we know you speak so openly about it.  What are the big things you take away from this whole experience of growth and finding your way back on and off the course?
 MARTIN KAYMER:   You know, finding a balance in your life; the life that we live can be really complicated, and because of so many options, you need to stick to one decision and really focus on that thing, and sometimes you get sidetracked a little bit.  You can play here, you can play there, but then the practice suffers a little bit and the little sharp in all departments suffers a little bit.
 I talked to Ernie about it today and asked him if he would be in my position being 36 years old, what would he recommend to me?  And he also said, sharpen all parts of the game; that even if you don't have a great week, you finish in the Top 15, Top-20; those sharpness in little parts of the game that is difficult if you keep playing all around the world, and that sidetracked me a little bit.
 So I need to work a little bit, but I enjoy the work.
