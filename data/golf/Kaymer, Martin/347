  Q. A terrific round of golf, any aspect of your game key to that today?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: My putting was good today. I hit a lot of solid shots, a lot of greens, and made a lot of putts especially on the back nine.  
  
  Q. After a few days after your win in France, what are your thoughts?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: That was a nice win last week, it's a huge tournament with a really, really good field. If you can perform well there, then you can perform well in the majors, too, I think, so that's why I'm really looking forward to next week.  
  
  Q. Some players seem to struggle after a win and they take something out of them when they win a tournament, you don't seem to be the case.   
 MARTIN KAYMER: I was. I was struggling after my win in Abu Dhabi and after my win in Munich, so yeah, it's a new experience for me this week. I was surprised, as well, a little bit that I'm still playing that well, because I'm really tired now, especially after the tournament in America, the U.S. Open, and then Munich was a lot of travel, and then last week the win, and I'm tired now.   
  
  Q. First year on Tour, you win Rookie of the Year, second year, you win a couple of tournaments and Top-10 in the Order of Merit, what are your goals this year?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I would really like to finish top 20 in the world, the World Rankings, that would be nice. And obviously everybody wants to win last tournament this year, The Race to Dubai in Dubai, so that would be nice.
