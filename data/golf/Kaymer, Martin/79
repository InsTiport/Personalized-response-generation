Q. Strong finish, a couple of close calls, what did you think about your round today?
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I never really got it going under par.  That was the problem.  I didn't make birdie on 5 and 6.  I had a very disappointing double bogey on 4 that threw me back quite a bit.  And then didn't birdie 10 and 11.  So I never really got it going today on the greens.
Q. How disappointing is it with the finish or are you pleased with all the hype and everything coming around still to finish strong?
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, it's a solid round and a solid tournament.  But at the end of the day, if I finish top-10, top-15, it doesn't get me much of anything.  I was here, I came here to try to have a chance on Sunday afternoon, and that was pretty much gone after nine holes, which is disappointing.  But I think that I can build up from the game the way I played.
Q. Can you compare just a little bit how it played in 2010 versus this year?  The conditions and that?
MARTIN KAYMER: Unfortunately, it was a little bit easier.  The greens were very soft, the fairways were very soft.  I was hoping for a very tough golf course.  Because I won it at 11-under, it was enough, now you need 20 or even more.  So I think that if they would have tricked it up a little bit more, but they just got a little unlucky with the weather.  It was raining so much on that second day.
Q. Do you think it was more wind, lack of wind or maybe more conditions of the greens?  A combination?
MARTIN KAYMER: No, the golf course, you can't put it into a negative.  The golf course was great.  The greens were fantastic, so that's always a positive.  I think that they were just a little bit unlucky with the weather on Friday that made it very playable for us.
