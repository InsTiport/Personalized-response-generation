Q. Tell me about your round today, how pleased are you?MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I'm very happy, bogey-free round at a major is always good.  I think I gave myself a lot of chances the first 10, 12 holes.  I would have loved to have made a couple more birdies because I played really well and I putted well, but in general, to shoot 4-under par is very good, especially the last six, seven holes is very, very long.  You hit drivers, and then 2-irons and 3-irons into the greens.  It's very tough to make birdies.Q. Are you pleased with how the championship has gone overall for you?MARTIN KAYMER: Expectations were a lot higher.  It's my favourite golf course in the world.  I've been successful here before.  Of course you're thinking about winning it.  That's why there was a priority on the biggest goal.  Didn't really seem much of a chance after yesterday because yesterday was really the day where you could score, and I shot only 2-under par and probably level par was 3- or 4-under, so yesterday was pretty much the day where I didn't give myself a chance for today anymore.Q. Was it different for you playing on a Monday for the final day?MARTIN KAYMER: No, it didn't really matter at the end of the day.  There were still a lot of people out there.  The weird day was Saturday.  You had a break within the tournament.  I never had that in my career.  I still hit some balls on Saturday because I really needed -- I felt like it was probably the best day that we had all week.  It was just impossible to play golf.  But to finish on Monday, you know, there was a Hugo Boss day planned for today, and it's only once a year.  It was really, really unlucky for them.  Henrik and me, will come a little bit later today and do a little bit more tomorrow, but a Monday finish is fine.
