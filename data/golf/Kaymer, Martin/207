 Q.   With Martin Kaymer who just made the winning putt for the Europeans to win the Ryder Cup.   21 years after Bernhard Langer missed a decisive putt at Kiawah, you were here making the decisive one here at Medinah.   How did you feel standing over that putt?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean, to be honest, I don't know.   It's a feeling that I've never had before.   On Friday I sat down with Bernhard and talked to him a little bit about the Ryder Cup because my attitude wasn't the right one.   But now, after that match today against Steve, I know how important the Ryder Cup became and is for OlazÃ¡bal, and Bernhard helped me so much just to sit down with me and talk about it.  
   
 Q.   You've won a major championship and now you've won a Ryder Cup for your side over in Europe.   How do you compare those two feelings?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean, it's a completely different level.   The major win was just for myself, but I can see the guys behind me, my brother was here and my father was here, Sergio ran onto the green.   It's so much more behind me.   Now I know how it really feels to win the Ryder Cup.
