  SARAH GWYNN:   Martin, thanks very much for coming in today, and congratulations on what is your first ever hole‑in‑one.   Just talk us through it.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Good, eh?   
SARAH GWYNN:   Yeah.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I hit it perfect yardage.   When I hit the golf shot, I thought I had hit it a little short, but fortunately it had the right distance, pitched in, pitched a little short and then rolled in.   It was my first hole‑in‑one ever.   Never made one, and I said it earlier in the interview already that I had a little deal with my physiotherapist, and every hole where I can win something where if it's a car or watch, he gives me a 10 or 20 Euros or first shot.   If I don't make the hole‑in‑one, then I get the money.   If I do make the hole‑in‑one, he gets the prize, so I think I come up a little short now.   
SARAH GWYNN:   Because it is quite a nice watch that he's getting.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's a beautiful watch, yeah.   But he deserves it.   He does a good job.  
SARAH GWYNN:   And it came at a very good time because it keeps you in contention at the top of the leaderboard for the weekend.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think I was four behind and then all of a sudden only two behind, so they're close together.   Obviously it's important to stay close to the leaders, but I think it depends on tomorrow.   You ve got to be in contention or close by Saturday afternoon and then it all comes down to the final round.  
SARAH GWYNN:   Do we have any questions?   
   
 Q.   Martin, which would make you happier, the one that you win today or possibly the one that you can win on Sunday, that comes with the winner's check?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I don't know how they look like.   I mean I saw the one that I won, but I don't know which one I will get, but I think I will wear it pretty nicely.   Don't you think.  
SARAH GWYNN:   It's very nice.  
   
 Q.   Obviously exciting to be leading going into the weekend.   Is it frustrating that Rory is one of them?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   He's a golf player like anyone else.   So am I.   He's obviously very good.   But you know, I think it will be exciting.   This is what we are all practicing for, to be in a situation to play in the best players when it comes down to winning a golf tournament, and it would be nice to play the next couple of days with him and then see who will be on top.   
   
 Q.   You came out of Qatar with some momentum.   You played well yesterday.   It seems like you're really hitting your stride here, you're playing some really good golf.   Maybe talk about your round?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I played very similar to yesterday, hit a lot of tee shots, a lot of fairways, a lot of good iron shots.   I don't make a lot of mistakes at the moment, so that creates a lot of birdie chances, and especially yesterday I hit so many good golf shots the first nine, but I couldn't make any birdies, and that was a little frustrating, but then you know, you just gotta keep telling yourself to be patient, and obviously it worked out on the back nine yesterday.   
And the way I played today, again, was similar to yesterday and I had again a lot of birdie chances.   Not everything went in, but I had plenty of chances and if I keep playing like this and keep avoiding the mistakes, then I should be fine.  
   
 Q.   Martin, Rory said that he has this bet thing going on with you almost one and a half years.   Have you ever seen any money from him so far or are you just going to give him the watch just like that?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I will just give the watch to him because it was a bet.   If I lose a bet, I will pay for it, but I will make sure he will pay dinner for the rest of the week.   That's for sure.   
   
 Q.   One of the things we noticed in Abu Dhabi and Qatar was guys like yourself and Rory and Westwood, I mean we weren't seeing you guys at the top.   I mean it seems like you and Rory have now restored kind of a bit of normalcy coming into the weekend, the two top guys going head to head.   How does that feel to kind of be in the mix ‑‑ basically playing for the win coming into the weekend after Abu Dhabi and Qatar?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean I think it's one stage.   It's not so much about finishing in the top 10 anymore.   The only thing that matters is the trophy, to leave Sunday afternoon the golf course knowing that you've beaten everyone, you know, that is the pure effect.   And I think that is what everyone is fighting for.   A few players say that they want to win, but they don't really want it as much as others.   
And I think Rory is one of those people he really wants to win, and you know, I'm not coming here for just playing four nice rounds of golf in the sunshine.   I would like to leave this place with a trophy.   
   
 Q.   Martin, for someone who was world No. 1 and now the world number four, which means one of the four best golfers in the world, are you a little surprised that throughout your career you've never had a hole‑in‑one?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   You like that hole‑in‑one, don't you?   I think I came a lot of times very close, you know, and I talked about a lot of times the last couple of weeks because I played with Sergio in Abu Dhabi.   He made one and then I asked him how many hole‑in‑ones did he have, and he said something, eight, nine.   Then Miguel said I stopped counting.   Then I thought once it just has to happen.   Obviously you need to hit a good golf shot and you need a lot of luck, and that happened today.  
   
 Q.   What was the club?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   162 meters, which was 180 yards.   I hit an 8‑iron.  
   
 Q.   Your manager said you actually spoke to him about the possibility of hitting a hole‑in‑one in Qatar, you spoke to him that you should be hitting a hole‑in‑one soon?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   In Qatar?   Did I?   I don't know.   You ll have ask him.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah.   I mean we talked about ‑‑ I talk about it probably every week.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a feeling that it was coming?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   You should sit up here as well and I should ask you.   (Laughs).   I mean it's luck, you know.   It's not so much ‑‑ there's not a lot of influence.   You can hit a good golf shot and hope, and the most important thing is I made 2‑under par on one hole and I got closer to the leader.
