Q. You saved your better till last this week with a brilliant final round of 65.  Tell us about it from your point of view.
MARTIN KAYMER: I wouldn't say the ball-striking was much different than the first three days.  I just putted a little bit better.  I saw the good score coming.  It was just not showing on the scorecard.  Fortunately today, great momentum going into Wentworth next week which is a big event for us, so I'm very pleased the way I could finish, finally good here, a good tournament.
Q. You started your round from the 10th and made your second eagle of the day at the 4th, so with five holes to go you were within four shots.  What were you thinking at that stage?
MARTIN KAYMER: I didn't really look at the leaders to be honest because they were so far ahead.  Today it's very playable.  I think winning score might be 12- or 13-under.
So I just tried to give myself a few more chances, maybe creep up into the top 5, which would be a great effort after being mid 30s before that round.  So that was the only thing I was think about.
Q. Tell us about this course in these conditions.  Say you had a one-shot lead with four or five holes to play, a good course for that scenario or a difficult one?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think depends a little on the other guys.  The thing is you can't play defensive because you have two par 5s on 16 and 18.  But today 16 is not reachable, so four is a possibility, but 18, anything can happen.  You could make 6 or 7 or 3.  So you need to continue to stay aggressive but maybe not too much that you give yourself a chance for 4 on 16 and 18 and hope that the others don't make 3S.
