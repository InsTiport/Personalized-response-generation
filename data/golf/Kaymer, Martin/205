Q.   Carnoustie is known as the most difficult of the three courses.   How do you feel about your 2â€‘under? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Unfortunately I made bogey on the last hole, the only bogey for today, would have been a great round, 69.   I played very solid.   The putter was not really hot.   But in general, I played solid on the toughest course I think here, Carnoustie.   So we have another two rounds to go at Kingsbarns and St. Andrews and I think it's more scorable.

Q.   How many pats on the back, congratulatory handshakes and messages from people around the world have you received since holing that putt on Sunday?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, obviously I can't count but there are plenty.   It's a very nice feeling to come to St. Andrews and to come here to Carnoustie and a lot of people were for us on Sunday obviously and they were watching.   It's just nice to hear.   It's very nice. 
If you put everything in consideration, we won last week The Ryder Cup, this week I get to play with my manager and friend, Johann, my brother is caddying for him, we play one of the best golf courses in the world, nice weather; so it's tough to beat.
