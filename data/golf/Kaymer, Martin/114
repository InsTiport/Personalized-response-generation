  MARTIN KAYMER:   Came off very, very hot the third shot, and flew the green which was is surprising for me.  
   
 Q.   And I take it you were fully aware of the situation of what you needed at the last?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Of course.   That's why I went for the green on 16.   I thought if I can make 3 there, I can square with Bubba.   And I saw that he made double‑bogey 17.   So all of a sudden there were five, six guys in the lead.   It was just unfortunate with 18.   Thought I had a good yardage. I thought it was a perfect yardage with hurting wind, through the week, surprising.   
But I take a lot of positives out of that week.   It was a good week.   I played really well and I have another two or three big tournaments to go.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure you saw the leaderboards, a lot of up‑and‑downs through the back nine, was that surprising?   Did you think it was going to be a roller coaster with six or seven guys in at the end?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, after nine holes I thought the winning score might be 14‑under par and 11‑over would have been enough for the playoff.   
So therefore, you know, even though I missed a few putts in the first nine, a few chances that I had, I didn't use them but after 16 holes, everything with respect to even‑‑ I didn't really care anymore.   It was just about the last two holes and I didn't play them as good as I wanted.
