   MARTIN KAYMER: Playing-wise it was fine. It's just nothing went in. I hit every green in regulation on the back nine and I just made one putt and it was on the last hole. I was in good position, but it didn't happen. It was a frustrating day. I just tried to keep fighting until the end because you never know what's going to happen. It's a tough finish here the last four holes, so maybe you could pick up a couple shots. 
 But overall it was a frustrating tournament because nothing went my way. 

 Q. Do you think it played similar today as it did yesterday?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think it played similar, maybe a little more difficult than yesterday. Obviously to see Stricker, to shoot his score you have to be making putts. No one really made the putts, and that's why I think all three of us had a disappointing day.

 Q. Irrespective of how hard the golf course was playing, I know you've been working hard on your swing, but at the same time, do you maybe neglect some of the other areas because you're focusing so much on your swing? Do you feel like you've put as much time into your short game as you have your swing?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I haven't really focused on my swing at all the last couple days. I just want to play. I work on my swing when I'm on the range, and when I'm on the golf course I just play, and I was just very unfortunate on the greens. Nothing really happened. I had a lot of lip-outs and putts that went over the edge.
