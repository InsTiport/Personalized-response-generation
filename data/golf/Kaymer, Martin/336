   MARTIN KAYMER: It's not easy, but I like it here. It was my first win and my memories when I walk down the 18th fairway, so I fancy the whole golf course. 

 Q. Is it more motivation for you --
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, always up there. I won one 2008, finished second 2009 with a great eagle on the last. So I've always played well here. It's very similar to Arizona where I practise in the wintertime, so yeah. 

 Q. Big changes this year with the rough and new grooves, how will that affect you? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, of course it's a little bit different, but it's not a big difference. It affects your new irons since the end of November already, so I got used to it already. 

 Q. And was the 5-under a reflection --
 MARTIN KAYMER: I left a couple out there. 16, I missed an easy short birdie putt from probably five feet but in general, a lot of good approaches, especially on the front nine, 7, 8 and 9, so I was pretty pleased with my round. 

 Q. And you're fully fit and ready for next season?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, the goal for 2010 my goal is obviously to play The Ryder Cup and it would be nice and I would like to finish high on The Race to Dubai. I'm 100 per cent healed now, and when I take out the screws, I will be 100 per cent but it's not possible at the moment, because I can't take them out. They still have to stay in there. 
 If I take the plates out, it will take another two, 2 1/2 weeks to recover, and I never really have a break for three weeks, so I really don't know how it will feel after that, it might feel different or will feel different, and I don't really want to risk missing more tournaments.
