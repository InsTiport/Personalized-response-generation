   MARTIN KAYMER:  It was a big difference today.  I was struggling at the beginning already, and made a lot of bad shots today, not very similar to yesterday.  It was totally different today. 
 And I think the most problem was with my playing today, I had a lot of problems with distance control that I will practise now a little bit and then we will see. 

 Q.  Surprised? 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, the expectations were very high today.  I think from all the other players, from all my friends, and even for me, but I played level par today, so I'm still in the top, three shots back but still Top-5 and still 36 holes to go. 

 Q.  There are actually so many positives to take, but I presume at the moment it doesn't feel quite like that. 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  No, definitely not.  But yeah, I don't know, I played -- on the back nine I played really well and made good putts that didn't go in. 
 Yeah, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 

 Q.  I suppose it's the nature of golf, isn't it, Lee Westwood in Germany the other week shot the same score in the first round and pretty much the same in the second. 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, I don't know what the problem is for the second round, or after this unbelievably good round. 
 But I think it's all about the expectations and yeah, that's just how it is. 

 Q.  And I guess to an extent that means that going into the weekend, you can be a little bit more relaxed once again and you can't beat yourself up about today is; you're back in the pack. 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, just try to enjoy the weekend.  I made the cut and I'm probably qualified for Valderrama, playing the World Cup.  So just unbelievable season so far, and I can't wait to play all these good tournaments.
