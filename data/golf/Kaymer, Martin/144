STEVE SANDS: Martin, looking at your scorecard after that birdie at the last, a 72 compared to the 65s on Thursday and Friday.  What was that to you?MARTIN KAYMER: It was good.  I didn't play as good as the first two days, but I kept it very well together.  I felt like today if you have 25 feet or 30 feet on every green, you've done well.  The USGA put the pins in very, very tough positions.  On 18 it was probably the easiest pin today and, fortunately, I could take care of it.STEVE SANDS: How satisfied are you with that 72?MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, very.  I made a couple bad swings on the first nine, put myself in bad positions, but I only made bogey, which is okay.  Only one birdie and one eagle, so I'm happy.  8-under par after three round is a good score.STEVE SANDS: It's a U.S. Open, it's supposed to be tough out there.  We'll see you on Sunday.MARTIN KAYMER: Absolutely.
