 Q.   Martin, your last tournament was in Dubai last year, can you please tell us a little bit how you spent Christmas and New Year's?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, after Dubai, I flew back to America.   I practised there.   Spent Christmas, New Year's, everything in Scottsdale and then last week I've been home in Germany to see my family.   Had a few appointments and then I came out here on Monday.  
   
 Q.   Defending champion here in Abu Dhabi, and of course today was not your best round, probably your highest score ever.   You started off with a double‑bogey; did that put you off your rhythm?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it was a little bit ‑‑ I don't know why the officials put out‑of‑bounds there.   I think it's a little bit ridiculous to putt it there, but that didn't really, it was not a good golf shot.   But I just didn't make any putts.   
I said to my caddie, if you putt like Stevie Wonder, you can't make any birdies.   
   
 Q.   Despite the out‑of‑bounds on the first hole, did it change?   Did it get more difficult?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The golf course, it's definitely more difficult than the last few years.   The rough is very thick and I think the fairways are a little bit tighter.   The greens, they have not changed, but for me, they were very difficult for today.  
   
 Q.   What is your game plan for tomorrow?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I need one of those rounds that I've played in the past, one of those mid‑60s.
