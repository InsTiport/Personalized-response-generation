 Q. 3-under par out there today, is this your first time here, and what do you think of the golf course?
 MARTIN KAYMER: It's a fantastic golf course, I think one of the best I've played in America to be honest. It's very difficult. You have to hit a lot of good tee shots. 
 I made a couple of mistakes today because I didn't -- I was not 100 percent sure about the golf course. I missed on the wrong side. So if I can avoid those things tomorrow, it would be nice. 

 Q. You've been No. 1 for three weeks, still No. 1. Are you thinking about it or are you just kind of going with the flow?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Of course I'm thinking about it. It's a lot of motivation if you know that you are the best player in the world. So of course I really enjoy that. 

 Q. The par 3s here at Innisbrook are tough, three of them over 200 yards today. How important is it to play those well?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think it's just important to hit the green to give yourself a chance for birdie. I think in general if you shoot level par on the par 3s, that's a fantastic score.
