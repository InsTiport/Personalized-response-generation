Q. Talk about the delay and how you're going to prepare for tomorrow.
MARTIN KAYMER: Tomorrow, I don't know how the weather is going to be tomorrow.  Maybe probably going to be the same.  An ideal case, we're going to play 36 holes tomorrow, which I don't mind.  It's going to be good for the guys who are fairly fit.  It's going to be a mental challenge to stay on top of your game for that long.
Today, it's pretty much a day off in terms of golf, but mentally we always have to be ready to play.  But it's going to be a long, long week now.
Q. How do you think conditions are going to be tomorrow?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think the golf course, obviously we're going to play it fairly soft, and the major thing for us is always the greens.  When we have soft greens, then you'll see very low scoring because you can be very aggressive.  I think you've got to shoot low scores in order to have a chance on Sunday.
