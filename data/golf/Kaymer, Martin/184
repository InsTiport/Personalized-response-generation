  MARTIN KAYMER:   It was very tough and cold.   The golf course played very long.     The greens were fine.   But I was not expecting that the golf course plays that long, because especially the first three or four holes, I think I was 1‑over par, which is okay, actually, because I hit 4‑iron into the first, and a 4‑iron into the third.   
So it played really long.   But I'm very pleased with 2‑under par.   
   
 Q.   It's good that you say that you felt it was okay, because you were then nice and solid before things turned your way on the back nine?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I would say to be honest, I didn't play the best golf, but I scrambled very well and I kept the ball in play.   I hit a lot of fairways, and I didn't give myself a lot of birdie chances, but if I had birdie chances, I made them.   I was very pleased to finish with two birdies.  
   
 Q.   You've played here in all sorts of weather conditions; how does this compare?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it was never that cold I think, and the coldness, that makes a big difference.   Cold wind, the ball doesn't go anywhere.   Even downwind it doesn't make such a big difference.   So today was a completely different day for me to play on the golf course.  
   
 Q.   And the wind, the way that swirls in the trees, we all know that's likely at Wentworth.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, but that happens to everyone.   You hit a good shot and all of a sudden it comes up ten, 15 yards short, but it doesn't happen that often, because it was not that gusty to be honest.   It was fairly fair to play.
