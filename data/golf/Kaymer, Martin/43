MARTIN KAYMER: Pretty much playing for second place, so overall, another Top-10, which is fine, but you know, I'm looking forward to having two weeks off now and then start off in China again.
Q. Looking to get the win, etc.
MARTIN KAYMER: I'm playing good enough and I'm putting good enough right now.  It's just a couple shots here and there.  Overall it's fine.  This week you have to accept that somebody has been better than me.
After playing three weeks and then being The Ryder Cup last week, yes, it's tiring.  But the main reason why I play here is I can play with my dad and my brother can caddie for him and I've won here before, so they are all good things.
I really, really enjoy playing these tournaments.  It's a shame now that I can't play the British Masters next week.  But you have to reset, especially for the last four events, and playing here in Great Britain, it's definitely the place where I like to play the best.
Q. Verdict on the week?
MARTIN KAYMER: Played good.  Played really solid.  I gave myself some chances but then made a couple mistakes today, the two bogeys.  I was not really playing for the win today because he ran away, but playing for second for sure.
Gave it a good go this week.  Especially when you talk about my energy level coming from The Ryder Cup, it wasn't 100 per cent.  So it was a very, very nice week, playing with my dad again, we made the cut.  So overall, it was a good week.
Q. You not only made the cut, but you were up there competitively in that team event.
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I think we finished fifth or sixth right now.  Then yeah, the net, one and one, obviously he made a birdie on the par 3, the 11th hole, which is a tough one for anyone.  I would have taken a two there.
I think for me it's a very, very enjoyable week.
