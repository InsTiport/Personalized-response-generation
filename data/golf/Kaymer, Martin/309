  Q. When you made your debut did you imagine you'd be involved in something as good as that?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: It was a fantastic day. A great dayfor us. We got five and a half points out of six and for my first Ryder Cup I couldn't expect better. The most important thing is tomorrow though. Officially we only have to get five points but our attitude needs to be to get 12 points. We cannot rely on the other guys. You have to get your own point and go from there.  
  
  Q. Huge momentum - you guys must be on cloud nine?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: OF course. We are happy and pleased and the Americans might be a little disappointed about the day but for us we just need to keep the momentum going. We did that from last night when we left the golf course. We started with a birdie straight away which was so important. It was so important to start of well and everybody is playing well. We have a young team and with the support we have we can definitely get the trophy.  
  
  Q. How much would you fancy being in a match possibly having a putt to win it?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I would love it. That's why I am here and that's why I have been practising for so many years. For me - I would love to have that. To make European golf proud. To make Colin Montgomerie proud. I don't know how I would react but it would probably be the best feeling of my life.
