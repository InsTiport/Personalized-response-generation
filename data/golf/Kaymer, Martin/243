 Q. Very quickly sum up today, very good start to the defence of your title. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: I played good golf but I left so many shots out there. I missed a couple 12-footers and I didn't really -- I shot 1-under on the par 5s with good birdie putts. Unfortunately I made a bogey on 12, that's an easy par 5. So I could have shot a little bit better round. But 4-under is not a nightmare. It's okay. Still have three days left. The leader is 6-under. 

 Q. So, not far away?
 MARTIN KAYMER: No.
