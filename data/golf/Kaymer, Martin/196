  MARTIN KAYMER:   I couldn't keep the score today.   I shot 1‑under par, which was fine, especially the way I was driving the ball.   I didn't hit a lot of fairways.   I think I hit only three fairways.   That's not really my style usually, so I kept it together.  
   
 Q.   Looked like there was good stuff and bad stuff that you certainly wouldn't be happy with.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I definitely didn't hit a lot of fairways but my putting was very good, so I had a few good saves and then a couple really nice, long birdie putts that went in.   
But overall, you have to hit fairways.   In order to shoot low here, you've got to hit fairways, and that is what I need to work on this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   Your score, decent foundation for the week?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   1‑under par is okay.   It's nothing special.   I didn't kick myself out of the tournament and I'm not really up there, so it's okay for now but there are three more rounds to go and if I keep hitting fairways or if I start hitting fairways, then I think I can go lower.
