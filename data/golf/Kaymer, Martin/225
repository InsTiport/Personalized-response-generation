  MARTIN KAYMER:   I played fine.   I didn't play good, or not as good as yesterday, or on Thursday.   But I had a lot of good chances again.   I hit a lot of good putts, but they just, you know, they were so tight.   Hit a lot of edges.   But I see it as a very positive thing, because I feel confident the way I swing the golf club.   I was very positive the way I putt.   So if I can be a little lucky tomorrow, I think I can shoot a good score. 

Q.   Saw a few close‑ups, you looked like you were at war with yourself and things were just not going your way?
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's very tough to pace yourself.   You want something so bad, and you know you can make those birdies.   It's just a matter of time and it just didn't happen today.   I want to say it's frustrating, but it doesn't get you into the right direction.   You get stuck. 
But golf, you can't chase it, you have to wait and hopefully a few putts will drop tomorrow.

Q.   It is a much more difficult today for everybody concerned, the wind is up, nice for spectators and when you can walk fairways but otherwise tricky?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, nice for the other people who don't have to play golf but it's not that difficult.   With all respect, Lee Westwood, 5‑under par is a fantastic round today.   The pins were tucked in some corners, and so I hope they are going to set up the golf course tough tomorrow.   Maybe we've got a little bit more wind, what the forecast is, and then he can't run away and hopefully we can catch him.
