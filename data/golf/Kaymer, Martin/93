Q. Does it feel like a U.S. Open?MARTIN KAYMER: Well, the weather is like the U.S. Open style because it's more like somewhere in the U.K., obviously what everybody was talking about the first three days we've been here.  It definitely plays very fast as a golf course. What I said in the press conference already, I think it's a little bit of advantage for the guys from the U.K.Q. Do you enjoy playing this course?MARTIN KAYMER: I do enjoy it a lot, yeah.  You have to think where you want to leave the ball.  You think you hit a good shot and it ends up in a completely different position.  You have to adjust a lot on the golf course in the moment really.  I enjoy playing those golf courses lot.  It's never really boring.Q. You said you had a funky start.  Was there any part of your round today that maybe surprised you?MARTIN KAYMER: Just to be honest, we've played the golf course the last three days where you know what you are going to get.  The greens, they were not super fast this morning which was nice.  They are not going to get super fast this afternoon because the sun is not out.  Overall it was pretty much what we thought it was going to be.  Mike did a very, very good job with the golf course today.  It's not easy to set up the golf course.  Today I think he did a good job.Q. Do you think you can go out there and (inaudible)?  You saw Dustin at 5-under.  Who knows what's going to happen this afternoon.  In terms of your own strategy, talk about your strategy.  Do you feel like you have to make up anything?MARTIN KAYMER: 5-under obviously is a very special round.  He must have played very good and he must have made a lot of putts as well.  It is possible obviously, but it's very rare.  It was rare last year as well.  To shoot 5-under the first two rounds is not really expected.  So I think anything around par is always a very good score on the golf course.
