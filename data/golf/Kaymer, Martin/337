 Q. Thoughts on the day? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I was coming here to Dubai with a lot of hopes and didn't really go my way this week. Played all round around par, 71, 72, which is not enough to win The Race to Dubai. But at the end of the day, I had a very good season, finished third in The Race to Dubai and I can see myself improving every year. So I'm pretty happy.

 Q. Ross Fisher said the golf course didn't really favour him and he's got to get used to it a bit more, which he has done over this week, but maybe come here a little earlier next time. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I came here on Saturday evening and it didn't help. I don't think it really matters when you come. But it's a very weird golf course. You really have to like it. It's not really my type of golf course. You can't really see the golf course all the time. You can't really see the surface of the green when you're on the fairway. It's not really my favourite golf course. I fancied Valderrama a lot more. 

 Q. I know we'll have further chance to reflect on the year next week, because there's a big event coming, and that will presumably have a big bearing on how you reflect on 2009. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yes, next week is going to be the World Cup. That's going to be nice to play with Alex Cejka again. We always did very well the last couple of years. 
 It's going to be a good one, very nice golf course. And if you like your partner, if you get along with him very well, it's going to be a very fun week.
