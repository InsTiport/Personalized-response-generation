 Q.   What does it mean to be here for your national championship and playing on The European Tour?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think the old events, the prestige events we had, we need to support as much as we can because The European Tour is a very strong tour, and we have to keep it that way.   
So we as players who play obviously in America a lot, I think it's necessary and it's the right thing to do to support the events, if it's this week or if it's The French Open or it's Wentworth or whatever it is; those were great events and they are great events.   
So you should participate and you should help The European Tour because they deserve it, and I think you are‑‑ it's always your responsibility.   When you look back in the 80s and 90s what the guys have done for The European Tour, if you take Seve and OlazÃ¡bal and Faldo, I think you owe it to the Tour, as well.   
   
 Q.   Does this always feel like home to you?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean, I like to go to America and play those events.   But if you ask an American, where would you rather be, I'm sure it would be his home country, too.   
   
 Q.   What is your attitude about playing an event in your home country and how it differs to other weeks?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The attitude is‑‑ I mean, should be the same as it is every week, but it can't be because it is different.   It is special when you play in your own country.  
Obviously for me, the expectations are quite high from the fans, from the spectators and as well as from yourself because you want to perform a little bit better than other weeks.   And that will be the fine line; and the thing that you need to learn as good as possible to still perform and not focused too much on you want to perform well.   You need to put that pressure away a little bit if you can.  
   
 Q.   Have you learned how to get that balance right?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, I don't think so, because every year is very different.   Last year was a very tough one, I had just won the U.S. Open, and then you come here, you win such a big event, and then you don't really have time to celebrate or that it really sinks in, because this week is another highlight for you if you play in your own country.   
Obviously this year, I have not done well recently in America.   So it's time that I perform as good as I can again.   So I think you treat every year very different.  
   
 Q.   With America in mind, how are the energy levels this week?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well the positive of missing the cut is you have another two days to recover.   Two days, nine hours, is a lot.   Of course I would have rather competed in America until Sunday afternoon or evening, but it didn't happen this time which was very, very frustrating, because I thought I can show the results that I felt like were in me, and unfortunately it didn't work out.   
   
 Q.   And does that change your attitude this week, and make you all the more determined to get the game right on gear?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, the good thing is when you don't perform as good as you can, sometimes you are even more focused.   You practise that little bit more to show to yourself and prove to yourself and you need to find a way back.   
To be honest, after the Masters, I was a little bit fed up with golf because I've done it lots to prepare for Augusta and it didn't quite work out and then it was very difficult to get back and prepare for the upcoming events, because I was a little bit frustrated about my results at Augusta.  
   
 Q.   With this course in mind, does it help that you know it so well and you've had a fun Pro‑Am, as well, to play?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it does help.   I played here since 2003, obviously with a couple of tournaments in Cologne, as well.   But in general the good memories, the win that I had in 2008, all those positive memories, they help when you stand on the first tee or the 10th tee on Thursday.   
Today I played with a world champion, a legend, and a singer today, and we all know each other, and it was probably the best Pro‑Am I've ever played, because we really laughed.   I had tears in my eyes sometimes.   Very authentic people.   They don't want to play or they don't want to play any role.   They are just the way they are, speaking German.   It's nice to be here again.   The those athletes, they talk different; we speak the same language, and it was a really fun day and a good start to the week.
