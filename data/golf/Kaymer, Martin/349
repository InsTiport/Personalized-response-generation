 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Very happy, especially had a really good finish. I was a little disappointed about my first couple of holes on the back nine, couldn't make the birdies, and then especially the last five holes was really, really focused on game. I wanted to make birdies and didn't look at what was around me. I focused on my own shots, especially the last five holes. That gave me the possibility to make the birdies. 
 Obviously I made the important putts. There was one really important put on the par 3. That was a par putt and I couldn't make that. That was important for me mentally.

 Q. Rory is rocking a bit up front, but as a young player yourself who has won big tournaments, like the BMW, so what's he going through now?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Just get it on the fairway and hope other players are not making any birdies. That's what I thought last year. 
 But I hope that he keeps it together and brings it home. He played so well the last few tournaments, and he really deserves it.
