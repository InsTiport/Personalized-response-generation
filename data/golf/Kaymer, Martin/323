   MARTIN KAYMER: Very pleased. I had a slow start, first nine in the row, I was kind of hanging in there, and then three nice birdies in a row, 4,5 and 6, and, yeah, nice birdie on 9. Could have been easily an eagle. I had the perfect line, just left it short, from what was it, 15, 18 feet. So I'm very happy with that found for sure.  
  
  Q. 12th at Celtic Manor and 8th at the U.S. Open; do you feel like your game is getting better week-by-week?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I just have to get a little sharper around the greens. That's what I've missed the last couple of weeks and today it was very good.   
  
  Q. Obviously you've come to this golf course as defending champion. Did the memories come flooding back when you played the practise rounds?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: To be honest, only on 18, because I played it five times last year. And it was a similar pin today, I was thinking about how nice it was when I made it last year to win The French Open, and it's great memories.   
  
  Q. What about the bragging rights you've got over the Englishmen, have you used those and moved on after Germany beat England in the football?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: We had a few chats on the golf course about the soccer game. They were always complaining that they didn't get the second goal, but that happens.
