  MARTIN KAYMER:   Just left a few shots out there.   I made bogey on 12, bogey on 13.   Only par on 15 with a very easy chip and then took the wrong club on 16 to hit it behind the green.   So at least three or four shots I left out there.   But the good thing is I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament.   Par is still okay, and there's still more room.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling more confident this year?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   In the past when I came here, there was just some shots that I just couldn't hit.   I mean, the draw was for me always a shocker.   But now it's not for me anymore.   I worked very hard on my swing, really going with more neutral in general.   Not only for this week, but in general, I have the option to draw it.   But today on 10 or 13, very nice high draws around the corner, and I could see that the golf course can play a little easier if you don't have a 3‑iron into 10 and a 3‑wood into 13.  
   
 Q.   But today gives you something to build on, doesn't it?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yes.   I never really well played here, but now I feel more comfortable because I can hit any shots.   I'm not in those situations where I have to work really, really hard in order to hit it on the fairway.   10 and 13 was always for me, I was happy with a par.   Par was a birdie for me.   And now I can play it a little more aggressive because I know I can hit any shots.  
   
 Q.   During the practice rounds did you begin to realize, okay, this is going to be a little bit more easy for me now?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, before I came here, I knew I'm better prepared swing wise, and obviously it helps mentally, as well, if you know you can hit any golf shot.   When I played on Saturday and Sunday, I hit a few tee shots on 10 and on 13, and they were all good.
