 Q.   Martin, Molinari got off to a flyer, 10‑under par today, you shot 5‑under, sounds good to me, how does it sound to you?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   5‑under, solid round.   It was the first day of the tournament, obviously if you shoot 10‑under par, it's obviously a brilliant day.   But it's a very special day for him.   
For me, to shoot 5‑under par was good and I think I'm right in the tournament.  
   
 Q.   Even with these moist conditions out there, it seems it's very difficult to get the ball close to the hole and we haven't seen any breeze yet?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, I think it plays fairly easy at the moment.   It's a very wide golf course, and you will hit a lot of fairways.   It's just that you have to get the ball close to the flag and that's something that's a little tricky, especially with the pins that are on the corners and surrounded by some ridges.   It's not easy, and if you stay patient, there are a lot of great chances out there.  
   
 Q.   To me, watching you play golf as I have over the years, it looks to me like the way you flight the ball, links‑style golf is right up your street.   Do you feel that way?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I really enjoy it.   It's not only the golf course; the people, they have so much knowledge about golf.   They are so classy.   I think the whole thing, I really enjoy that.   
But the golf courses, the bunkers, I think they are the best bunkers in the world here.   It's very enjoyable.   I have a lot of fun when I play here.   
   
 Q.   There's been a 10‑under; do you feel tomorrow, no breeze, you can go out and shoot ten?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Ten, I think I need a lot of luck I think.   But we'll see if I can shoot something low.
