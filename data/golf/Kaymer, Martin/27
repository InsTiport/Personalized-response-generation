 Q.  Another Rolex Series Event, and coming back, past champion, you must be excited for this week.  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, it's one of those golf courses I really enjoyed in the past, every year I played since I'm on Tour.  It's one of those courses where you don't need to shoot 5- or 6-under par every round.  When you shoot par, 1-, 2-under, it's usually a good score.   
 Q.  Certainly a tough course to score on.  What are your thoughts on the course, especially the last four holes?  
MARTIN KAYMER: I think it's very exciting for us players, for the entire tournament.  Even though when you're two or three shots behind, you kind of like still fancy your chance on Sunday afternoon because a lot can happen there.  You can attack or you can play defensive, and you can make from birdies to double, triple-bogey, and I think that's always a great finish for a golf tournament.   
 Q.  You said after the BMW PGA you wanted to address a few things in your game because you haven't missed a cut in so long.  Have you done it?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I've been working quite hard the last few weeks.  I've been in America before the U.S. Open, and things come together nicely.  It's a very important summer now.
