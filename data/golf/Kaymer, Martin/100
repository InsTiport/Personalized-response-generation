Q.   Was it a tough match out there for you today?
    MARTIN KAYMER:   It was fine.   I played okay, I would say.   I didn't make that many mistakes.   Only a couple of bogeys. 
    But he birdied those holes, anyway.   It was okay for me even though he made birdies, so it was okay for me to lose the hole, especially the way I played that hole.
    There were a couple of key moments on 13 and 14. 

Q.   Do you like the new format of the event?
    MARTIN KAYMER:   As a European we are used to a little bit of it from the Volvo Match Play that we used to play back in the days.   So therefore we know how the format works.   And I think it's good for golf, for the fans.
    I think we should try it out this year and hopefully we can get positives out of it and then continue this format.
