 Q. Overall thoughts on the week? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Of course yesterday I played good golf and I put myself in a position to finish in the Top-10. If I could have played a little better today -- but the greens are not my friend here. 
 So, what can you do. I played, I think today, I played the best golf all week. But the putts didn't drop and it's a disappointing thing on one hand but on the other hand, I'm looking forward to go to Dubai now, leave the tournament behind me. I know that I'm playing well and my putting feels good, too. So it's all about next week, now.

 Q. What about the challenge of next week, a great field again for The European Tour?
 MARTIN KAYMER: It's good. I'm looking forward, I think the top three in the World Rankings are playing and obviously a few other guys, Rory is playing again. So it will be a good field and obviously a good challenge, similar to Abu Dhabi, a lot of World Ranking points. 
 And like I said, I like to play that golf course and if I can give myself a chance again, I have the possibility to win again on Saturday and Sunday would be great.
