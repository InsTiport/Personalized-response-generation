  Q. Thoughts about your round?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I hit a lot of good golf shots, but I was always maybe one or two yards short of the green, and then went back in the bunker, especially with 9-irons or pitching wedge. I had a lot of good yardage I thought, but it was so close to playing a really good round.   
 My short game saved me to be honest.   
  
  Q. But you are close?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think I'm close, yeah. I just need to practise a little bit more, and I need to hit the 4s maybe a touch better, and if my short game stays the same way, then I can shoot low.   
  
  Q. So you're not out of it.   
 MARTIN KAYMER: All depends on Luke. He's like a machine. At the moment, it's a little bit -- it's kind of ridiculous, yeah, the way he plays.  
 But it's nice to see. Obviously he deserves to be the No. 1, if it happens this week. Of course I would be happy for him.
