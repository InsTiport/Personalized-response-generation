 Q.  Two solid rounds, how disappointed are you with the dropped shot at the last?  
MARTIN KAYMER: The par 5, it was short of the green, you're thinking about four, leaving with a six, that's always disappointing, and a poor chip and 3-putt, you're never happy about it.  But have to see the bright picture, 8-under on two rounds, which is okay.  So tomorrow we play my favourite golf course and ready for it.   
 Q.  How much are you looking forward to playing your favourite golf course alongside your father and your brother?  
MARTIN KAYMER: It is a very relaxed atmosphere.  We chatted a lot.  We had a lot of fun on the golf course, too.  It's a very nice atmosphere when you play a golf tournament like this and when you have your family with you, it takes the seriousness out of the game.   
 Q.  Does it bring back some old memories when you used to play before?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Obviously I've done it before with my brother.  We played together when my dad caddied for him, and the other way around.  So you know what's going to happen.  You just look really forward to that week and it's the same this week again.
