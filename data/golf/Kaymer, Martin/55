 Q. Tell me about the experience of being an Olympian, as opposed to a golfer, a Major Champion. Is it different?   
MARTIN KAYMER: You know, if you see the other athletes, how much work that they put into this week, and the love that they have for their sport, it's a completely different approach of playing your sport right now. You gain so much respect for the other athletes and you see your sport a little bit different, too.   
I don't know how different yet, because it will take a couple weeks to realise what really happened here, but it's so far already the greatest week of my career.   
   
 Q. Who have you met that impressed you, for example, from Germany, or from other countries, as well?   
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, there's one gymnastic guy, Andreas Toba. He got injured while he was doing his routine. So they have to move to four different places and he got hurt on one. He couldn't really do the last discipline, which was on the horse. But he still went on it and I saw him yesterday in the elevator, and he said, "Martin, the pain, you cannot imagine how much pain I had. But that's just what we do. That's what we do here."   
He said, "If the leg would have fall off, would I have done it. That's what we do." And he said, "While I was doing it, I had tears in my eyes and my heart was crying already because I know I can't do it tomorrow." It's crazy, the passion. I saw him in the elevator yesterday.   
   
 Q. How was the Opening Ceremony?   
MARTIN KAYMER: One of the greatest experience. Our leader there, Timo Boll, the table tennis guy, he was in front, and then behind him was a hockey player and the hockey player started singing the National Anthem when we walked in. And then you have 250 worldâ€‘class athletes behind you singing the National Anthem. Now that is special.
