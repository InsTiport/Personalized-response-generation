 Q. Tell us about your play today. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: I didn't play the best golf today. Fortunate that it was not recommended; it was not necessary to play the best golf today. I think I shot level par or even, or 1-over par and I could win it 3 & 2. So I saved some energy for the afternoon.

 Q. 3-up through five holes, did you feel control in the match? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I played okay. I hit fairways, I hit greens and he was hitting a little bit -- he wasn't hitting really good tee shots, so he gave a few holes off the tee shots already. 
 It was a pretty relaxed round but still in the end, 3-up, you have to stay focused. Because he can always make two or three birdies and then you're back to all square.

 Q. Noh this afternoon, you could be hitting your approach shots first, massively long, can you cut pressure on getting your shot in first?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think so. It's always an advantage if you can hit first. If I hit it close, I think it will be an advantage. But both of them, they have something -- Noh, I played against him yesterday. I know his game a little bit. 
 Alvaro, he's a local hero here, there will be a lot of people following us and not cheering for me. So it will be an interesting afternoon, anyway.
