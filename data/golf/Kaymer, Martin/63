 Q.  You followed yesterday's round at 3 over par with a round of 3-under, what was the difference in your play today?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yesterday I was very far away from the flags.  I didn't really create any birdie chances and then a couple unlucky things, the sprinkler, the second shot on 12 went into the rough.   
But overall, today was a lot better.  I hit more fairways.  My irons, I hit close and I could make some putts.  I made a couple long ones today.  3-under in those conditions is a very good score.   
 Q.  You've had a lot of success at this golf course and you're used to making a lot of birdies; are pars momentum here?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Absolutely difficult to make a lot of birdies.  This is really, really hard because once you miss the fairways, especially this week, it's going to be very tough to get on the green.   
Usually the birdie holes are the par 5s but if you miss the fairway, it's a long third shot.  Especially the ninth hole, I think it's one of the most underrated par 5s.  It's a great par 5, you can make four, but six can happen very easily, too.   
I don't see that being a golf course where you have to shoot 4- or 5-under every day.
