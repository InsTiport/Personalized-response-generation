 Q.   Talk about your round, being out there and having a shot tomorrow.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I have a chance tomorrow, which is really nice.   I think I put myself in a good position.   It was very tricky to do it today, so that, therefore, you didn't have as many birdie chances as the first two days.   
I think it played tough today.   Even when you hit fairways, it was gusty and therefore a little bit difficult to attack the flags.   
Fortunately, I made a couple of good up‑and‑downs.   I think you saw, Jordan and me, we only made four or five birdies in the group, which is not a lot.   
I think we didn't play great, but we kept it very well together.   So it was okay.   
   
 Q.   What's it going to take tomorrow?   What are you going to have to do, stay patient, be aggressive, what?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think it depends a little bit on the par‑5s and obviously the last three holes.   I think you need to take advantage of the par‑5s, if possible, and then stay cool and calm on 17 and 18.   
But it's very important that you enjoy the day tomorrow as well, because it's a rare opportunity that you want to, that you are in the leading group, one of the biggest events that we play all year.   So I think it will be a good day with Martin.
