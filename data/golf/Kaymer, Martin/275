  Q. Was it just one of these days where you just couldn't get anything going?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, for me it was a difficult day. I was a lot of times in between clubs and obviously on that golf course, in order to make birdies, you have to be aggressive.   
 I couldn't really be aggressive if you don't know if you have the right club, and then once in awhile, I got a little unlucky there.   
  
  Q. Some bad breaks?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, and I couldn't make the putts. It was a tough day. But for me it was important, I didn't go back; I stayed in there. I kept it together.   
  
  Q. So you're seven back now, is that too much?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: I'm not really thinking about the win. For me it would be nice to play another good round tomorrow. I finished well last year. I finished third. It will be difficult to get there tomorrow, but for me it would be a satisfying week if I finish in the Top-10.
