   MARTIN KAYMER:  I woke up yesterday morning, and when I looked in the mirror, it's all over the place, the rash, my feet.  Underneath my feet is actually the worst, and it hurts when I'm walking.  And on my fingers, you see the red sprinkles there.  It's not good if I grip the club.  Whatever.  It's a disappointing round actually.  Yesterday was tough but today was very easy.  I didn't play very well.   
  
  Q.  So when you woke up yesterday, that was when you first saw --   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, that was the first time that I saw it.  I went to the hospital, but they couldn't help me, and it was too late to go to the doctor on site here.  So I decided just to play and go to the doctor after the round.  He couldn't help.   
 And then we went to the medical care facility, and they gave me an injection and some pills, but it's not very good.   
  
  Q.  Do you know what the injection was?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  I don't know, some nature stuff.  That was really what I wanted, no other things, just nature stuff.  She gave me some powerful injection, whatever she called it.   
  
  Q.  Was it painful in any way?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  The injection?   
  
  Q.  No, the actual rash.   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Underneath my feet -- it's not itchy, but underneath my feet and fingers, it's interfering with my golf.  Unfortunately this week, it's a good chance to get a couple points, so I have still a chance tomorrow, so we will see what's going on.   
  
  Q.  You don't have any history of allergies or anything?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  No, out of nowhere it's come from.  Maybe it's -- I don't know, maybe I ate something wrong.  The doctor said it's probably some allergy, whatever, but I don't have allergies.   
  
  Q.  Not that you know of anyway.   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, obviously.
