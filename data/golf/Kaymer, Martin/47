Q. Congratulations on your point, very different seas here on the final green compared to four years ago.  Can you reflect for us on this week at Hazeltine?
MARTIN KAYMER: To be honest with you, after seven, eight holes, I actually thought maybe can come down to the last two, three matches again like Medinah, because it looked quite decent for us.  But then obviously in the end, when you lose, it's very tough to keep it together and keep playing your own game.  In the end, you know, you start the day -- it's about you, making your point, and we all tried and we all fought very hard but in the end it's a disappointment we didn't win.
Q. You've had success in majors and in Ryder Cups.  Is there any similarity between those two things?
MARTIN KAYMER: No.  Nothing.  One, you only win for yourself.  The other, it's a lot bigger than that.  Both means a lot to you but on a completely different level.
Q. Good vibe in your team room all week?
MARTIN KAYMER: It was.  We were all very motivated and we wanted to retain the Cup.
