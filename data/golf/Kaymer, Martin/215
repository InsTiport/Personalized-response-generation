 Q.   Tell us about playing in this event, so close to home.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, I've played here a few times in the past.   Obviously a different golf tournament, but I think it's nice that we move the tournament now.   It's my homeland here.   This is where I grew up.   I played that course many, many times.   Finally I can sleep in my own bed playing golf tournaments, it's very rare.   
But I think with the support of the spectators and my family and my friends, it's like a 12th man when you play football.   Hopefully they can help me a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Clearly you've played in Munich on so many occasions and enjoyed that but this makes it more special, does it?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Munich, I won there in 2008, but to play here in front of your friends that you grew up, it's different.   I have breakfast in the places where I used to go the last ten years.   I can go to the restaurants where I usually eat.   
So it feels‑‑ just being at home and playing a European Tour event in your backyard a little bit.   But you should never forget it's still an important tournament.   It's not only about having fun and just playing a couple of rounds of golf.   This is a serious tournament and I would like to play as well as possible.  
   
 Q.   Is there home advantage knowing this course so well?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean, we will see.   I think it can be a little of an advantage if you know the golf course and you know where you can't hit it or shouldn't hit it.   But in general the golf course is fairly open and you can see a lot.   So if you play it five times or 50 times, it can make a little difference but not a huge difference.  
   
 Q.   Can you recall the first time you were coming here?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The first time I came here, I was waiting for the players on the 18th green looking for autographs or hats or gloves or something.   That was in the late 90s.   
   
 Q.   Were there specific autographs you were looking for?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I always wanted an autograph from PÃ¡draig Harrington, yeah.   I think I got it on Saturday of the tournament, and a glove from Ernie Els.   And then I played a tournament, a junior tournament, and I wore a glove but only the first hole; it was way too big, but I wanted to wear it.   
   
 Q.   But it does make when you finish the 18th and you hear the clamour of the kids and the sounds, you know exactly what they are going through.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's interesting, if you think about it, obviously it was a new setting there, 15 years ago, and I know how happy I was when I left here just with a golf ball and a glove.   So just something very little can make a difference.  
   
 Q.   How was the U.S. Open?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I played well.   You didn't want to see me play on Friday because I missed a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, a lot of scrambling.   It was like Seve in his old days I think.   I kept myself very well in the tournament.   Saturday and Sunday, I played good golf, I played very solid.   
I had a lot of control over the ball.   Short game was very sharp.   I just made a few too many double‑bogeys, five double‑bogeys in a U.S. Open is a little too much.   But in general, I figure my game, that was the most important thing.   
   
 Q.   Have you told Ernie Els that you stole his glove from him?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I don't think he probably will remember, but that's why he was always‑‑ he was always the biggest role model for me.   It was so cool and so nice to get his glove; for me, it was fantastic.   I don't have it anymore, otherwise I would bring it.
