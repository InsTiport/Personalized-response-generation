Q.   Nice to get back on the horse I would imagine?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I had a good start.   Shot 4‑under on the back nine, my front nine.   And then the front nine was a little bit‑‑ obviously I played the golf courses in the past but I hadn't played it this week.   I was hoping to play the front nine yesterday.   Obviously they cancelled the Pro‑Am so the first nine, I needed to focus a little bit more with the lines. 
Actually I didn't really remember the golf course but there are so many holes right‑to‑left.   For me, the other way, I fancy that more, so it was actually more difficult than I thought to play today. 

Q.   But did it make it more satisfying nonetheless when you have that kind of realisation? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, you know, there's no change to my game.   I just became, if anything, I became a bit better mentally, so I was really looking forward to play here.   It was more of a challenge because the golf holes that I remembered, and therefore, the 5‑under pars, it was a very good score for me here. 

Q.   Not wanting to belabour the point, but obviously first round since we know what happened in your last round.   Any kind of sort of hangover from that or was that put to bed very, very quickly?
MARTIN KAYMER:   No hangover is the opposite.   I was very, very positive today because my game is good.   I just didn't make that many putts today.   I made a couple here and there but I had a few more chances.   So about Abu Dhabi, I only became better.
