 Q. 67 today, happy with that score?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I had a little bit of a slow start but then I played well at the turn. I made a great birdie on No. 9. It was like a 50-footer for birdie, made that and then kicked off and I had a lot of birdie chances today, a couple lipouts which was obviously disappointing, made bogey on the short par 4, 15, but overall, it was an okay start.

 Q. An okay start as long as 67 is your high score of the week; you shot 61 around here before. What is it about this place that you like?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think overall, it's not a very difficult golf course in general, and I think it was four years ago when I shot 61. I had only 23 putts. It was one of those days, you just have to look at the hole and the ball goes in. Yeah, obviously I played the same way this week, hopefully I can play another 61.

 Q. In commentary today were saying, the way you played in Abu Dhabi earlier this year, this place, scoring-wise is similar; do you feel like that?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Abu Dhabi is my living room. 
 I feel very comfortable here. Here in Portugal, the Vilamoura course is similar. I feel very good about it. A lot of tee shots suits my eye. I just need to make a few more putts and I think I can score well. 

 Q. If this is your living room, maybe that's your living room, this is your kitchen; play well tomorrow.
 MARTIN KAYMER: Thank you.
