 Q.   Thoughts on the day and the week?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Tough.   On the greens I was not very sharp.   I need to work on my wedges and definitely the putting, because playing‑wise, it's been really, really nice.   
   
 Q.   After that wonderful finish that you had in Shanghai last year, the way you started today, presumably you fancied you've got a reasonable chance?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I was trying very hard because my game is fantastic.   I just need to get the ball closer to the hole sometimes, especially with the wedges.   I had so many chances and I couldn't get it close enough.   
It was, I wouldn't say a frustrating week, but you almost get sad the way you don't use your chances and you see the other guys just making the birdies and you should be further up there.   It is what it is.   Everybody has to go through it and maybe it's my time now.   
   
 Q.   Talk about going back to a place that you won in such style last year?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, last year was a very nice success.   I won Abu Dhabi earlier in the year.   That was an HSBC tournament.   And then became a little flat.   Then fortunately, I played a quite nice back nine on Sunday and that got me the trophy.   
It's nice memories.   I look forward to going back next week.   Obviously a different golf course but the way I'm playing, I think I should have a chance.  
   
 Q.   The back nine, 29 streaks and 63 all together, that was some way to win a tournament?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I think had nine birdies the last 12 holes, and actually the easy holes, I didn't birdie.   
   
 Q.   You don't have many down times, but when you do and you need a pick‑me‑up, is that the kind of event you look back on?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think it's always nice if you have done something very special, and that was definitely something special, to win the tournament in that style.   I think I was five behind or six behind and then winning by three shots.   It's always nice if things doesn't really go your way to remind yourself that one day, it will change; it has to change.   Obviously now I go through a period which is rarely long, it shouldn't be that long, usually, but it tests my mental strength, I believe.   It's just tiring sometimes.  
   
 Q.   A change of venue, no longer Sheshan, but a venue you're familiar with courtesy of the World Cup?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I've been there I think two or three times.   It's a very hilly golf course.   It's tricky and it's good if you know it.   Glad to say I've been there before.   
   
 Q.   A testing track, the OlazÃ¡bal?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   A lot of doglegs and elevations.   You need to know some lines.   The greens are tricky.   Very exciting finish, I think 15 is a par 5 over the water on the left side.   18 is a tricky finishing hole.   So it will be definitely an exciting tournament.
