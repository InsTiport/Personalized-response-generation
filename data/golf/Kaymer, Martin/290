  Q. Thoughts about today?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yes, it was difficult but I screwed up in the end. I made a double-bogey on the 15th, and I didn't hole any putts today. I really struggled with those greens, since four years. Obviously I was hoping to play a good round but I just really struggled with the golf course.  
  
  Q. Is it just one of those rounds that you just put behind and you move onto tomorrow?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: No, it was not my day. I was not really happy today, and I don't know, it was one of those days that you, yeah, just try to forget and fight tomorrow to make the cut. I don't know where the cut is now but I'm sure I'm far away.   
 I know it's not going to be a good tournament for me. I really struggled to play -- for the three here, to have a chance and the next two, three days if I make the cut -- but at the moment I think I'm eight behind. So, really difficult.   
  
  Q. With the form you've been in, no birdies on the card, is that the most disappointing aspect?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: It is disappointing. I didn't give myself a lot of chances. It's just not the golf course that I fancy. I struggle with a lot of holes, and most of the greens, it's tough when you come from Abu Dhabi, you're getting spoiled on those greens.
