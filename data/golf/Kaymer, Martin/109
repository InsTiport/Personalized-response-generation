  MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, surprised, a little shocked.   I don't really know how to put it into words.   It was very, very surprising today.   Started off well and hit a couple bad tee shots and cost me double‑bogey and a triple‑bogey. 
Twice I missed the grass and I was in a bush.   Had to drop it in the sand.   Obviously then you get a bad lie and then it's tough to make bogey.   I haven't done that all week long.   Unfortunately I did today, and therefore, cost me the tournament. 

Q.   It's out of character, isn't it?   You never do that. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I do miss fairways, but usually you get away with it okay.   You don't make double or triple‑bogey.   But that is what happened today.   Another thing was I didn't make many putts.   I missed a lot of putts today, and therefore, was very difficult for me to make birdies.   

Q.   Do you take some positives?
MARTIN KAYMER:   The positives is I was playing really good golf.   That was nice after such a long break, when you play the first three days, I played so solid, missed barely a fairway.   And today was a little bit different.   But there's still a lot of positive, and that's tough to say after that round.   I certainly was shocked.
