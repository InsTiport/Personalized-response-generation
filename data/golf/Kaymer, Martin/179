  MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, very little chance, but I made three mistakes today, three bogeys, and if you want to win a tournament like this where you are three or four shots behind, there is no margin of mistakes and unfortunately I did those.   There was a tiny chance but not really.  
   
 Q.   Is it good bearing in mind there are other big events to come as well?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I played really solid the whole week.   I was very satisfied.   There's a couple more weeks coming up that are really big, France, always a nice tournament I like to go to, I really enjoy the golf course there and then the Open.
