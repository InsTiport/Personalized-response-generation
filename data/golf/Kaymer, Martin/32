 Q.  Overall there's been some back and forth on the 12th hole.  You're the 2014 champ here; do you like the changes on the golf course and what do you think about 12?  Will you go for it or lay up?  
MARTIN KAYMER: I think I will go for it, if the -- obviously, the conditions, we'll have to wait and see the conditions, but even if you hit it in the water you can still make an up-and-down for 4.  So I think it's a hole -- generally the back nine a lot can happen there now, because you need to make some decisions what you want to do.  If you are three or four shots behind you can still win the golf tournament because there are birdie and eagle chances now with that hole and obviously, 16, 17 and 18.   
 Q.  How's the game heading into this week?  Obviously the 2014 champ here; obviously you feel good playing out here?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I like the golf course because par means something.  If you shoot something around par, it's usually a decent score, and I enjoy those golf courses a lot more than just the playing competition.
