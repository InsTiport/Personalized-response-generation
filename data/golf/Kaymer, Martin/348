  Q. A little bit of a seesaw match out there, but a 1-up victory, snuck one out with Stuart hitting a really good putt on that last hole.   
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, he played very well, especially the back nine. I mean, I was hoping to end the match earlier, but all of a sudden he made that bunker shot on the par-5 on 14 and then made that birdie on 16, so it was quite tough. I'm happy.   
  
  Q. What are you looking forward to for tomorrow? Is there something you really need to work on, or what's clicking right now in your game?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I played very well actually. I hit a lot of fairways. I missed a couple of greens, especially on the back nine, so I'll work on my irons a little bit today and then obviously a little putting.
