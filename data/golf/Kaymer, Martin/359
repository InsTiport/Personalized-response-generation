  Q. Slightly different conditions than yesterday?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Slightly? There was a big difference today. It was really fun but I was really pleased. It was very, very tough. I'm 7-under par in total and I think it's in good position.  
  
  Q. Obviously we have Carnoustie tomorrow, how tough of a test of golf will that be?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: I mean, everything depends on the weather, but I think Carnoustie is the toughest course this week that we play. Yesterday Kingsbarns was I would say the easiest one.   
 But it will be definitely a great challenge tomorrow. It all depends on the weather. If we have weather like yesterday, it's not that tough but if it stays like that what the forecast is like, it's going to be really tough.  
  
  Q. In terms of your round today?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: On 17, I had only 100 metres to the green and usually the thing about birdies, when you're so close to the green -- I was hoping to make par being so close to the green but it was a little short.   
 I thought it was impossible, so I just wanted to make sure to make a safe bogey there.  
  
  Q. Great to finish with a birdie on 18?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: You could also drive the green. SÃ¸ren Hansen did and I was trying the same and I had a good 2-putt for birdie.  
  
  Q. You've won twice already and made such an impact on The European Tour; what would it mean to win this week?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think this is a very special event. St. Andrews, it's where everything started.   
 But the other guys, they all want to win as well, so we are looking forward to the weekend.
