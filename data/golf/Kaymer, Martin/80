Q. Talk about your thoughts on this morning.  Nice to get something out of it.
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, we got perfect conditions.  I think we were definitely on the good side of the draw.  We had perfect greens in the end.  Even 25, 30 footers, you think about making them because you just need to get them on line and get the speed right.  There were no footprints.  Even the short putts, they were fairly easy to make.
So it was a great way to finish for me, to finish with a birdie on 16, par 17, par 18.  But I still think that I left two or three shots out there the last couple days.
Q. Obviously it's never ideal midway in a round to go after last night, but did it give you a chance to maybe refocus?
MARTIN KAYMER: Especially after the couple bogeys yesterday, I didn't really mind.  I was very hungry as well.  I felt a little sick as well.  So I was very happy going back to the room to just chill a little bit.  Slept early, slept by 9:30 until 4:00 this morning.  So, the only thing that we need to manage somehow now is to get over those four or five hours.
Q. You're in that tricky, in between period, aren't you?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think I'm around maybe 1 o'clock or so, maybe 1:30, somewhere there.  So, yeah, it's a tricky one.  But I just think you need to leave that play that we have now, leave it for itself, go back, chill, and then really focus on the completely new day.  Even though it's the same day, it's a new day for me.
Q. Your thoughts on your position in the tournament?
MARTIN KAYMER: Again, I think I left two or three shots out there, otherwise I would have been right there.  I just need one of those 5-, 6-under rounds to give myself a chance for tomorrow.  It's possible, I just need to make a few more putts.  Those mid-range putts, I haven't made any, really, this week.
