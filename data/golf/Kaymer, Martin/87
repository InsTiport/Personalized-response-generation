 Q.   Pretty important finish, wasn't it?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The last three holes were very tough.   When I was standing over that putt, I thought there was a very good chance to get into the last group for tomorrow, and that was the goal.   Fortunately had a good read, made a good putt.   The double bogey, it does make it feel a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   When you have a double‑bogey on this course, are you able to shrug it off more easily than other tracks because it is so difficult?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it can happen so quickly without making anything wrong really.   I think I got a little gust there, as well.   It was not greatest lie and I was standing underneath the ball a little bit from the burned semi‑rough so it was a tricky shot.   Even from the fairways, it's not an easy one.   So it's easier to accept than other golf courses.  
   
 Q.   Burned semi‑rough, little gusts, there's all sorts of things to plague you around this tough track, aren't there.  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yesterday, the last five holes, they were tough to play.   I think we got a lot of wind this morning and this afternoon was the same again for us.   So therefore, you know, shooting 2‑under par today makes you feel more proud because it was tough to play.   
   
 Q.   Only halfway, but excited?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, very excited.   It's been a few months that I've been in one of the last groups of a tournament.   Obviously I enjoy that golf course and have had success on that golf course.   The crowds are behind me and playing with Victor the last couple of days was good fun, too.   A lot of people were following our group.   So I think it's going to be an exciting weekend.
