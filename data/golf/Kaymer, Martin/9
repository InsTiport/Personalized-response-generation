Q. Thoughts on the weekend?
MARTIN KAYMER: I had three good days, one not-so-good day.  And unfortunately, the not-so-good day was enough for me not to have a chance.  My hope today was if I had a fast start, if I can shoot three-under the front nine, back nine, I really, really like, I might have a chance to make them a bit nervous.  But then I made bogey, and that was really the killer for the day.
Q. The amount of people that come out to see you this week, the way the tournament's been run, how great a show did they put on here in Munich?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think the BMW International Open has grown the last ten years, a lot.  For me, I'm very proud to play in my home country, a tournament like that.  When you see the guys in the players' lounge, the food is amazing, which is maybe for other people not so important, but for us, to have those facilities, have the spectators, you have the fans, really golf -- that they are passionate about golf, you can see that.
BMW, they do proper events, and it's quite nice to have that associated with your country.  You know, BMW is from Germany; I'm from Germany.  It's a good thing.
Q. Overall, you've enjoyed the week?
MARTIN KAYMER: Of course I enjoyed the week.  It was an exhausting week but I really enjoyed it because I felt like I really had a chance to win the golf tournament in my home country.
