  MARTIN KAYMER:   Very disappointing.   I thought I hit more good golf shots today but putting was very tough.   I missed I think a putt from a foot today, and one from two feet, and it's just difficult to stay positive on the golf course.   
   
 Q.   Your playing partner said it was his putter that got him out of trouble but the two of you toiled, I don't know if the weather was more awkward or the greens were trickier.   
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Trickier is a very nice word, yeah.   It's just very difficult to score.   If you struggle to make putts, obviously we don't hit every ball six, seven feet close to the hole.   
    Sometimes you need those 20‑, 25‑footers that drop, and it's more luckier but still.   I think Marcus, he's a good putter in general, and he putted well today.   But in general, it's just tough to score.   It's just how it is and unfortunately I missed a few shots today.   It will be tough tomorrow to win, but you know, I have an earlier tee time so hopefully I can start off well and make some birdies early.   
   
 Q.   And I have no doubt you are aware that some players have scored well, 64s, for instance, so you know it's possible?   
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Absolutely it's possible, of course.   And the way I play, and the way I putt, is good.   I just need to be a little luckier; I need a little bit more luck tomorrow.
