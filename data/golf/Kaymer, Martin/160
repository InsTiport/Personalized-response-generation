Q.   Talk about where you are two rounds in. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   It was a little difficult today.   I thought it was already gusty in the morning, and the pin positions were a little bit tougher than yesterday.   I didn't hit as many fairways as yesterday but I managed my way quite nicely around the golf course, had a couple of nice up‑and‑downs, two longer putts went in, so I think I kept it really well together and kept myself in the tournament. 

Q.   A lot time to rest now before tomorrow's round?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do in the afternoon, but I'm not going to practice too much because it's really warm.   Rest for the weekend, watch some golf.   It's always nice when you played well Thursday and Friday and you play in the morning on Friday and you can watch some guys playing in the afternoon.   It's quite nice.
