  MARTIN KAYMER:   I played really well.   Like the first three days, I didn't make a lot of mistakes.   Unfortunately started with a bogey, but gave myself a lot of chances, especially on the back nine.   I had a little stretch of a couple eagles on 11 and 13, but I had chances on 12, 14, 15, 16, so could have been a little bit better.   But 5‑under par, it's a decent round today.   
   
 Q.   Two eagles in three holes doesn't happen all that often.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, it was a drivable par 4 today and hit it to four feet and made the putt there.   
Then on the par5, I hit it to six feet and made the putt.   So it was just two really good golf shots.  
   
 Q.   And when that happens, are you seeing a chance of a nice finish or even potentially to win it?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   To be honest, I thought if I had a really strong finish, I might have a chance of a playoff but they were running away a little bit at 9‑under and 10‑under par.   
After missing my birdie chances on 12 and 14, I knew it's not going to happen but still Top‑10 might be nice.   So we'll see where I'm going to end up.  
   
 Q.   And it bodes well for events to come.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   That's the main thing.   My goal is to play aggressive‑‑ I mean, I played aggressive the first three days.   I just wanted to play another decent round, good ball‑striking, chipping was a little bit better today and my putting was good, so I think I can carry on that confidence for next week.
