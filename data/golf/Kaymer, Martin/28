Q. Martin, obviously very disappointed to miss the cut.  What happened this week for you?
MARTIN KAYMER: I just didn't putt enough or didn't putt well enough.  I made -- well, I did actually putt enough.  I made too many putts out there unfortunately.  The whole group, even for Rafa and Sergio, it's very frustrating.  Sergio will probably lead the tournament by three or four shots.  It's very frustrating to come back to Germany every time and you put on greens like this.  It's very frustrating, especially if you played the way I played today.  I thought I gave myself some chances.  I hit some very good putts.  So obviously everybody has to go through it but to do that in your home country, it's not nice, but it is what it is.
Q. Are there things that you can work on ahead of the Rolex Series the next couple of weeks?
MARTIN KAYMER: I'm really working on the consistency; that I hit a lot of fairways and I putt well, and I think I did that very well last week at the U.S. Open.  This week was very different.  So I tried to not forget about the way I putted this week.  It was more about trying to think about what happened last week, as I felt really good on the greens.  So therefore, it was a tricky one this week.  Always is when you play in your home country, but the Rolex Series, there are obviously big tournaments coming up and with the French Open and The Scottish Open that I'm going to play, leading to The Open.  So there's a lot to play for.
