 Q. How pleased to finish with a 70?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I'm very, very happy obviously. There was so much wind today. The greens, they were very, very fast in the end, very bumpy. So even the short putts, they were very difficult. Yeah, I played very got first nine holes, made a lot of quality golf shots and then I had three bogeys in a row, two stupid bogeys, so not very necessary. And the 3-putt on 11 missed the green from a hundred yards. But overall I'm very happy with 70. 

 Q. The rough is pretty nasty, isn't it?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I think the rough issue is more like on the back nine, for example, 10,11, 12, 13, they are strong holes. You are very happy when you finish them level par, 1-over, 2-over, that's a good score actually, and then you've got a lot of birdie chances on 14, 15, 16, 17. They are all birdie chances. That's why I think there are a lot of birdies on the golf course.

 Q. How much did you enjoy playing with Rory and Furyk?
 MARTIN KAYMER: They brought out so many spectators, especially Furyk, he's very, very popular and Rory, he's a young stud, so there were a few little girls out there. I had a lot of fun out there. 

 Q. How excited are you about being in the mix going into the weekend of a major championship?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I don't really know. It's my first time that I'm up there in a major, so yeah, I think the only thing I can do tomorrow is just stick to my game plan, hopefully a few more putts are dropping, and we'll see on Sunday but I feel really good about my game.
