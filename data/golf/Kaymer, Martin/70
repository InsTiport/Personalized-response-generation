 Q.  How would you reflect on a first round like this?  
MARTIN KAYMER: I think it was a good start.  69 is never really a bad score.  Missed a couple fairways the last two or three holes and therefore didn't give myself much of a chance to make birdie.  But overall, it was a solid round.  I was very pleased with my putting.  A lot of the putts, they started on-line.  So overall, it was fine.   
 Q.  Which means it's a good foundation on a course which you obviously know and love; the course presumably hasn't changed a lot this year?  
MARTIN KAYMER: No, it hasn't changed much, especially the change that happened on the 7th hole.  They didn't use it today.  So overall, I think I placed myself in a decent position.  I know I can always shoot a low score on that golf course, as long as I hit the fairways, and especially this week, it's even more important.
