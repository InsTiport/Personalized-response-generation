 Q.  Is that a good continuation of where you left off in Ireland last week?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Playing, that's for sure.  Score-wise, not quite.  I made a lot of good putts today.  They were all in good lines but left a lot of putts short.   
Yes, it's a little bit frustrating that you don't get the score that you could have had, but overall, I can only build up from that, the way I played golf, and I can only see the positive now and try to get it going tomorrow afternoon.   
 Q.  There must be plenty of positives to know that this is a good foundation for the week.  
MARTIN KAYMER: It's a very good foundation on a golf course like this, where you've got to drive it fairly straight, because there's not much rough on the left and on the right, there are more trees.  So you've got to avoid the trees.  If I can build up from there, and confidence-wise, was a big boost, the last two or three rounds that I've played.  So I feel like I'm in a good place.
