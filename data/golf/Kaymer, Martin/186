Q.   Can you comment on your first week here at HP. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   When I came here on Monday I was happy with the golf course.   A lot of holes go left to right, really suits my eye, and I was driving the ball well coming into this weekend. 
I think that's the key on your fairways.   I was unfortunate the first couple of days because the putts didn't drop and today was brilliant with only one bogey. 

Q.   Super tough out there with the wind conditions today. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, it was tough, but, you know, it's called "scrambling" feels a little like the British Open without rain.   So you scramble and play along.
