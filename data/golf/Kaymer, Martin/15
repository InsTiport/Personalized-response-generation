 Q.  You haven't played here since 2009.  What brought you back?  And you found a beautiful golf course to play here this morning with that round.  
MARTIN KAYMER: First I became a member at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, and I saw Jack Nicklaus a few times and he asked if I would come here again.  And also being part of that club now, the scheduling and everything worked out very well, especially heading into the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.  I felt like it was a good time to stay in America and play those big events over here.   
 Q.  The birdies coming in really helped you take advantage of putting a pretty good round on the board.  
MARTIN KAYMER: I putted really well today.  I hit solid golf shots.  I think in general it was just a solid round of golf.  Very little mistakes.  And if I made a mistake I saved it with a good par-putt.  So overall it was a very pleasing round today.   
 Q.  Anything you found specifically with the putter?  Right now first in strokes gained putting, you rolled it really well today.  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, they start on line.  And sometimes if you don't read them well and they don't start on line it's frustrating because you don't know what the mistake was.  If I start them on line it's just a misread if I missed them.  And I could read the greens really well today.
