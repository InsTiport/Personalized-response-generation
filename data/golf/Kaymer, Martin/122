Q. How special does this one feel?MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I played really well.  I played very well.  I just made a couple mistakes coming in that was not good.  I just wanted to finish the match before the par 5s because I know he hits irons to greens.  But to chip-in like this, it's a big rush^ .Q. How loud is it?MARTIN KAYMER: I took a pill for my headache before I got out because I know from the last two days it's going to get very loud, just in case.  But I must say, there's so much support, it's crazy, every single hole you get goosebumps.  It's one of the best Ryder Cups I've played.Q. That crucial half-point yesterday, heading into the singles, how much did that set the tone?MARTIN KAYMER: Well, everybody talks about the momentum, and we didn't play really well the last four or five holes and we didn't have the momentum on our side and hen 18 was huge.  I hit a good bunker shot, and Justin finished it off and it was brilliant, and I think for the whole team.  And it's very important what Poulter did last year, helped us a lot and I think that was a big one for us.
