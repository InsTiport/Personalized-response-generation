 Q.  Assessment of your final round today?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Played solid.  I made a couple of mistakes.  The bogeys I made were really from nowhere.  It was a 9-iron on the ninth hole, and then pitching wedge, or a gap wedge, actually, on 13.  Bogey on the par 5 on 10, you never really want that.  And then kind of like I was almost out of the tournament.  I was just trying to give myself chances, hoping for a couple putts to drop in.  That didn't quite happen.   
Tommy played really well, especially over the weekend.  So all the credit goes to him.   
 Q.  The shot on 10, in the trees there.  
MARTIN KAYMER: That was a loose one, yeah.  I didn't think the wind will take it that much to the right side, because I wanted to leave it short right in the bunker.  Maybe should have just laid up to the left side instead of trying to go for it but those things happen.   
 Q.  What positives do you take out of this week?  
MARTIN KAYMER: A lot of positives.  I think my putting was very good, very consistent.  A lot of putts, they started online this week.  Ball-striking, especially mid-irons and long irons have been very solid.  So there's a lot of positives.   
 Q.  Going on to Qatar and Dubai?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, Qatar, I haven't been for two or three years.  The next few events, well, in general, those three events, they are great events to start the season with.  Obviously I really enjoy this place here.  It's almost my second home.  Didn't quite work out this week, but Qatar and Dubai I look forward to.
