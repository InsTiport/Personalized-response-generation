Q.   Your thoughts on 2‑under par around here to start? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Very good.   I think every round around par is pretty good.   Played very solid today I think. 
You can take advantage of the front nine a little bit; I think you will have some chances because they don't play that long.   Obviously the last three or four holes was very challenging and I did very well there today.   So that was I guess a huge motivation for the front nine, so my back nine.

Q.   We did have a slight pour but with the rough down, it might be a little bit easier this year; but it's not, is it.   It's still a huge challenge. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think that golf course, you can never really set it up easy.   Even though this year will play a little bit easier without the rough, but you still have to make the putts and try to get it close to the flag. 
Especially today, the first nine, very challenging.   We had a lot of wind in the wrong direction, as well.   15, 16 and 18 was playing into the wind, so you know, very pleased with 2‑under par. 

Q.   Appreciate you've done on plenty of times and plenty of occasions, but is it fun playing with the leading national player and home crowd and all that support? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   To be honest the last few tournaments I've played, I played with Rory in Wentworth and Ireland, and then there the U.S. Open, that was a huge one.   And last week, I played in my own country and this week played with Victor. 
So I feel like there's a lot going on around my groups always, but it's nice.   Obviously that's the reason why you play golf.   You don't want to play in front of ten or 12 people.   You want to play in front of hundreds.
