Q.   Obviously the big thing is making the cut here for the first time.   Is there any relief at all in actually doing it?
MARTIN KAYMER:   A little bit, yes.   But the way I play golf, I think I had 16 greens in regulation today.   If you shoot 3 over par, it's very frustrating.   Overall, it was a lot more ‑‑ I'd say I had a lot more chances to shoot a lower score.   If you hit 16 greens, obviously the greens are not easy but I (inaudible).   It's a shame, but I'm playing the weekend.

Q.   What do you want to do the rest of the day?   Any preparation to take to the weekend? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I played really, really good golf.   In terms of ball striking, the golf ball is no problem.   I just need to be more brave with my putts and a little bit more confident.   I think once I make a few more putts in a row then I think I can build some confidence.

Q.   How did the course play today compared to yesterday? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think obviously it was not as wet, but the wind made it more difficult today.   I think the scores were not as good as yesterday were, so the pins were difficult again. 
I would say it played similar or maybe one or two shots tougher than yesterday.
