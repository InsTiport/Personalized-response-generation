Q.   What will you do this afternoon? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I will go back to the range, hit a few balls and hopefully get the feel back that I had on the first nine.

Q.   You had some really nasty up‑and‑downs on the back nine, a bit unlucky in a way. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, I put myself there.   There was no one else.   They were not easy but they were doable.   On 3, you should make at least bogey, and 6 behind the green, the par5, was not a very difficult chip.   I hit a poor one there, too.   So it cost me a few shots on the back nine unfortunately. 

Q.   Lovely way to finish, great up‑and‑down. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   It was a very good up‑and‑down.   It was a little bit of hit‑and‑hope.   I was standing half in the water, half out, and the lie was okay.   I could see the ball halfway.   So there's not much you can plan on.   You just hit it and hope it gets somewhere on the green and unfortunately went out to six feet and I could make the putt to have a half‑decent finish today.

Q.   I know obviously in your homeland, it's a big tournament for you; is it more difficult on the back of Chambers Bay? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it's going from one extreme to another.   You know, obviously last week, you have to pitch the ball a lot in front of green or sometimes in front of the green to get it close.   Here you can be very aggressive. 
So going from one extreme to another is never easy, because you have to get over your feel sometimes.   And I think that's why Henrik, he played a brilliant round today.   He was very aggressive with his irons and he putted well.   So to change that quickly, that's quite impressive.
