 Q.   Are you pleased with your day's work?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, yesterday was very solid.   I hit a lot of good golf shots today; the first nine were good, and the back nine were not my best.   I really had a poor finish, especially on 7.   I had a tough lie on the rough and had to take a drop there and unfortunately 3‑putted No.9, so my 18th hole.   But in general, I think I'm in a good position for the weekend and that's the most important.   
   
 Q.   When you look at last week's finishing rounds, 78 and 77, I'm sorry, you don't want to look over your shoulder, I know, but when you do that, how do you make an adjustment to come back so quickly?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think it's a mind‑set and belief in yourself.   Obviously I can play good golf.   It was just not really happening this year so far.   A couple of bad breaks here and there.   You struggled a little bit to shoot good scores, even though you are not playing that bad but it's tough to make birdies sometimes if we don't get those fortunate breaks.   
Yeah, I had a very good time off on Monday when I was back home in DÃ¼sseldorf, and this week, I got a little fortunate here and there, and then all of the sudden, you start off better than in the past.   
   
 Q.   Were you pleased for Marcel Siem?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, Marcel, he came up a few times short this year unfortunately.   He could have won a couple more I think.   It was a matter of time that he will win another golf tournament.   It's been a long time for him that he has won, but it was a nice celebration.   
It was nice to see him winning, especially on 18, even though there were a couple of groups still out on the golf course, but they couldn't catch him.   I was very happy for him, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward now to the weekend, what do you hope to get from your game this weekend?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I just need to be‑‑ the only thing I am struggling with a little bit is my long irons.   Unfortunately there are not too many long holes on that golf course that you have a lot of wedges.   So I will go to the range and try to fix that.   I'm putting well and chipping well; it's about enjoying the weekend and trying to put myself up there on Sunday to have a chance.  
   
 Q.   And hopefully the good breaks will follow?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I hope so.   
   
 Q.   A very nice round today puts you firmly in contention for what could be a second win in this championship.   Tell us about your progress today and how much you're enjoying this week.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   I was a little surprised about the first nine, I made a lot of birdies, seven birdies in nine holes, and that was quite nice.   Struggled a little bit on the back nine, didn't hit the ball as good as I did in the morning but I think I put myself in a good position for tomorrow and Sunday.  
   
 Q.   There was a problem just coming home there with two bogeys in the last three holes.   How much was it off‑putting to have that ball plug at the 7th?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, it was a bad lie in the rough and I was hoping that I could get a free drop from that lie.   It was a tough one.   I needed some support from the referee but I unfortunately 3‑putted 9, my 18th hole.   But in general I'm playing well and that's the most important thing.  
   
 Q.   I know you love links golf and you've won here in Scotland; is it a bit of a relief to play this type of golf after your struggles in France at the weekend?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   It's a completely different golf course.   Last week you need to be very straight from the tee and thick rough and fairly fast greens.   
This week, it is, for me, coming home to play golf.   That is what the sport is all about.   It's very enjoyable.   You have to feel the golf course and you have to feel certain shots, and it's not a matter of playing nice golf.   It's about getting the job done.   It's fantastic.   I really do enjoy it.  
   
 Q.   Is there a debt of thanks to your gran who you spent the weekend with?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   It was just on Monday, I just needed to mow the lawn, and that was fine.   We worked a little bit more on the backyard.   It was just nice to go back to being normal.   Obviously that is not the normal world we are living in here on the golf course.   Everything is a little bit different and it's always nice to go back where you're coming from and see my grandma and spend some time with her.   It was a good time.  
   
 Q.   Cutting the grass; I'm sure the greenskeepers could sort you out later on if you want.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The golf course looks good to me.   I don't want to ruin it.
