  Q. How deep did you have to dig to win that one?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, very deep. I was playing good golf. I shot 5-under in 20 holes, which was not bad. It would have been tough if I lost it. I played solid golf.   
 But he came really strong back on the back 9. He made a lot of good putts. But it was a good fight.  
  
  Q. What are the pressures like in a playoff, where one bad swing and you're going home?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I just remind myself of Whistling Straits. I had the same club on 18 that I had at Whistling Straits with a 7-iron. When I was standing over the ball, I thought just do the same you did a few months ago and you would be fine. Obviously there was not the whole way I wanted.   
  
  Q. Hunter Mahan tomorrow, have you played much with him?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: No, not at all. I think I played once with him. I can remember him from the Ryder Cup 2008 where he made almost every putt. It will be a tough match tomorrow.  
  
  Q. The only top seed left in, are you feeling a sense of opportunity?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Not really, you know. When I got that question in the press, reference about No. 1, it does make -- it would be nice if it happens this week. Hopefully I will get more opportunities in the future. But we will see. I still have three matches to win, though.
