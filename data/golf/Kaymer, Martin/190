  MARTIN KAYMER:   A little bit of a disappointing weekend.   I shot only 2‑under par.   It's not enough if you want to win a golf tournament.   I was playing very well today and I had a lot of chances, especially the first nine.   But I just couldn't make the putts, so it's a little frustrating, but the end of the day, I played good golf and next week I'm going to play again, so maybe then. 

Q.   It is a good run of form, isn't it, sixth place maybe at the end of this, not at all bad, Top‑10 finish?
    MARTIN KAYMER:   No, it's fine, what I said, I'm playing very well at the moment.   It's just about making the putts in the end.   It was I little struggle on the weekend.   It worked very well the first two days but today and yesterday, not so much.
