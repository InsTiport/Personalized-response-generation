Q.   What goes through your mind in a situation like this with a three‑shot lead? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, it was a little sad that we had to stop.   I had a really good round going, played really solid, hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.   Unfortunately I left a couple short on line, but I played really decent.   It's never nice if you have to stop, and especially when you're trying to win a golf tournament.   I can't change that.   Just got to make the best out of it.

Q.   You've had time to study what the leaderboard says.   Does that change anything for the way you will prepare for the resumption of play, whenever that may be?
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, not really.   A three‑shot lead is not plenty, especially when you're facing 15, 16, 17 and 18, so I just have to keep playing and hit fairways, hit greens and just avoid any big mistakes.

Q.   Talk to me about your strategy of you just don't want to think so much anymore.   Is that holding up in the final round?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, very well.   I just play with feel.   If I see a shot that I think is the right shot to hit, I hit the shot.   In the past I was just trying to play a little bit more safe because I was not very comfortable with my swing, but now I play the right shots the way you have to hit and play the golf course, and it's worked out so far.

Q.   I know there are some rules officials in the locker room where you guys are gathered.   Are they telling you anything about the potential resumption of play?
MARTIN KAYMER:   No, not much.   I mean, I don't know if we're going to play again.   I think if we have 30, 45 minutes an hour delay with the weather, then they need to give us I think 30, 45 minutes to prepare again.   It's really been tough since Thursday to sleep well and really to go out every day, and maybe we have to sleep another night.   It's a long, long week.
