  MARTIN KAYMER:   A little disappointing, because I had it going really good in the beginning.   Yeah, unfortunately made bogey on the par5, 8, and a couple mistakes here and there.   I really had a chance to shoot 7‑ , 8‑under par without any problem really.
It was a shame on 18; hit a really nice 3‑wood a yard further, and a tap‑in for eagle.   But it's fine.   I'm playing really good golf, and had a good week. 

Q.   So it bodes well? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I'm really happy with the week.   That's all you can do.   After the second round, I was almost out of the tournament and I'm still finishing Top‑10 right now.   So I take that positive attitude to Turkey. 

Q.   And presumably it's just one little step, if only a small step, but just to make the consistency of the four days?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, it's not much.   I don't really know what the difference was to yesterday or let's say from yesterday to Thursday or Friday.   It's so tiny little things and I think if I can do, not like 10‑under par, but if I can play really consistent every day and really avoid mistakes or silly mistakes, I think I have a good chance to win very soon. 

Q.   Still excited about The Final Series, about The Race to Dubai and everything that is still to come?
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, absolutely.   They are big tournaments for me.   Turkey, Dubai and then I have another one in South Africa where I'm going to defend the title from last year.   So there's no little tournament.   We are halfway now with The Race to Dubai final, and I think it's going to be really exciting once we get into Dubai.
