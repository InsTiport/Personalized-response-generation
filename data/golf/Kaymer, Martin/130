  MARTIN KAYMER:   When we played, it was very playable.   I don't think it was very difficult.   It was still playable, a bit longer than yesterday.   The rain wasn't pouring down when we played but it was okay to play.   
   
 Q.   What do you see with Rory?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   When he hits the driver that straight and that long, and the short game is incredible, it's very difficult to beat him.   His iron shots, they are very solid.   He doesn't miss many golf shots.   
So you just have to respect it a lot, how good he plays.   There's nothing wrong with his game; putting, chipping, bunker, whatever it is, and he hits it 20, 25 yards longer than anyone else.   He's definitely the best player in the world.   
   
 Q.   Were you happy that you were able to chip‑in when he was close?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   All three of us were in the bunker and I was the only one who made the bunker shot.   But Rory, he still made the up‑and‑down.   There's not much going wrong with his game.   That was only one example.   Even when he misses the green, he still saves par, and all of a sudden a couple of eagles.   It's impressive the way he plays golf now.
