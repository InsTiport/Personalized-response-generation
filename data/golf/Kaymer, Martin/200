Q.   You clearly liked the course. 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I played well.   The first nine, I made all the putts to put myself in a very good position for the back nine.   Then I couldn't drop a putt anymore.   I mean, 18 [] fortunately went in, but apart from that, I struggled a little bit on the back nine. 

Q.   Clearly you're much happier with your game and where you are at the moment? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, very happy.   I'm playing consistently, a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, so overall I'm quite happy where I am. 

Q.   What's it been like, a lot has been made about 11 of The Ryder Cup Team being here and Ollie, has that helped? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I mean, in the end, obviously it helps the field.   It's a very good field this week.   Playing‑wise, you want to‑‑ I wouldn't say I try hard or anything.   It's just tougher to win the tournament because of the field.   But in general you play your own game and it's just the competition this week is a little more or harder than usual. 

Q.   The next few weeks, looking forward to that? 
MARTIN KAYMER:   I think I'm going to play four more tournaments this year, and they are big tournaments, good fields, a lot of prize money, a lot of World Ranking points.   So all those things make it very exciting for the last stretch of the year.
