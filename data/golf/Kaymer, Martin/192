 Q.   Your thoughts on a lovely round of 67, did you flush it out there?   
    MARTIN KAYMER:   It was okay.   I played a lot better than the last few rounds I played, especially in Abu Dhabi.   But I was a little fortunate today, a few putts that dropped, but on those greens that happens sometimes, and I think 9â€‘under is a good position to be in.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned the greens yesterday and they were bubbly in the afternoon, were they much better in the morning?  
    MARTIN KAYMER:   No.   They were not a lot better. They were a little bit better.   That's just how it is.   It's a shame because usually you come here and it's a beautiful golf course and this year, the greens they are struggling a little bit.   But overall to play with Justin and Louis, we had a good time, and so now we look forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Elaborate on what is a beautiful score, because you are in a lovely position on the board?  
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, at the moment, I'm tied for the lead.   But I think by the end of the day, I might be two off the lead, three shots behind, and that's okay, as long as I can reach up to the top and not too far away, it's okay.  
   
 Q.   Your expectations are always high but going into a weekend here, what do you expect of yourself?   
    MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, to win, you know, that's why I'm here.   But in the end of the day, I'm happy if I give myself a chance on Sunday afternoon.   
   
 Q.   Your game is better from Abu Dhabi onwards?  
    MARTIN KAYMER:   The first week is always a week where you don't know if the practise pays off straightaway, what you have done in the wintertime but I learned a lot last week about my irons, about my driving, the way I drove the ball, and I could use it very well this week already.   So yeah, I think it will be a good weekend.
