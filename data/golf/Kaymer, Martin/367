 Q.  You've now kind of become known not only throughout the world but in America.  I think it's still fair to ask the question, who is Martin Kaymer? 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Actually I'm just a normal kid.  I'm from Germany, 23 years old, and I turned pro two years ago or two and a half years ago.  Now I'm just really happy to be here and play all the big events.  Not only in Europe and America, as well, which can help me a lot for the future. 

 Q.  Do you have goals for '08? 
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Actually, my first goal was -- when I started, my first goal was to keep my card on the European Tour, and then after the first tournament, everything changed because I won the first event that I played, and my schedule changed totally.  I'm able to play The Masters in two weeks, a couple more majors, all these great events.
