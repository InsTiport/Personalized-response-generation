   MARTIN KAYMER: I was struggling at birdies to putt him under pressure but I had a really good finish with the eagle and that was a nice moment, a little like last year with the spectators around me, so it was pretty cool. 

 Q. Some defence of your title, isn't it, really? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Kind of. I finished second but only one shot behind Paul Casey. But I'll system really happy with the week.

 Q. It's not often somebody does follow-up with back-to-back victories, so you must be proud that you actually fought to the wire in the manner that you have?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Honestly I feel a little pressure on Thursday because I had a lot of phone calls, e-mails, and there were so many people were looking after me that week. 
 So I felt a little pressure, but I think I handled it very well. 

 Q. And you'll be in that position again, won't you?
 MARTIN KAYMER: It's good. That's why I'm practicing so hard, and I always want to be in this position and now I am in this position and I will be in Munich in this position, as well. It's good, though.
