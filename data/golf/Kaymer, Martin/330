 Q. A tight match and then you birdie 13, 14, and 15 to go 3-up. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: I played very solid all day. 13 is a par 5, I was on the green with the second shot and just made a solid two putt. 
 14, holed one from the fringe, and 15 was a chip putt for birdie. So pretty much a long par 3, and then 15. Almost holed it on 16. 
 I won 4 and 2, which is pretty good. We look forward to tomorrow because I played very, very solid today.

 Q. I know you go to Scottsdale in the winter and practice. Have valuable is that experience?
 MARTIN KAYMER: The altitude is still different here. Scottsdale, I would say -- compared to here, here the ball flies 10, 15 yards farther than Scottsdale. It's amazing. Today and Monday was incredible. Yesterday was a little different. 
 It takes you two or three holes to get into it to see how far you are hitting the irons and the driver. It worked well for me.

 Q. No. 6 in the world right now. Have you surprised yourself with your speed in the World Rankings?
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I'm a little ahead of my schedule, for sure. I think I can handle it very well at the moment. You have to be patient and try to pick your goals step by step, not too much. 
 Everyone is asking me when are you No. 1 in the world now. This is very far away from that. Let's take it step by step. 

 Q. Is it true you have been go carting again?
 MARTIN KAYMER: No comment.

 Q. Yes, it is. 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I was go carting last week, yes. I really drove like a little girl the first two laps. I was a little scared. I felt like I was chasing the time already, and then I was a little scared. I think when you are scared, something will happen. 
 I just went back in, and I'm going to skip it for a while now.
