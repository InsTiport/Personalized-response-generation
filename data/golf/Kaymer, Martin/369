  Q.  What did you hit for the eagle?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  3-iron.   
  
  Q.  From what distance?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  218 metres.   
  
  Q.  So when you had that shot in your mind, you were going for the eagle?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Yeah, of course.  I want to win.   
  
  Q.  But there was no defence in that shot?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  I thought eagle or bogey.  I was not thinking about par.   
  
  Q.  Great way to finish.   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  It was a good shot, pure golf shot, yeah.   
  
  Q.  And a second after winning in Abu Dhabi would be a fantastic three weeks for you, wouldn't it?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Last week I didn't make the cut but there were a lot of things after the win so I was a little confused on Monday and Tuesday.   
 But it was really good that I had the weekend off, actually, that I could think about different stuff, and especially the win, it gave me a lot of confidence for the whole season.   
  
  Q.  Interesting to see now where you've moved up in the World Rankings.   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  Really looking forward to go to the Match Play now.  I had a good three weeks so far.  I was practising a lot when I was in America in the winter, so I was expecting that I'm playing okay.  But of course, I was never expecting that I would win the tournament.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel seeing your name up there?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  It was so much fun to play with Ernie.  He was so relaxed, very nice to me.  We talked a little bit.  It was just a nice golf yesterday.  That was actually the best golfer I've had the last two years.   
  
  Q.  Further step on getting to Kentucky in September, too.   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  I'm not looking so far down.  I heard it from my manager that I can play in Augusta now, so that's unbelievable, too.   
  
  Q.  How does that feel?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  I don't know yet.  I mean, it was always a dream and now I can play there.   
  
  Q.  Will you play a few rounds before you get there, too?   
 MARTIN KAYMER:  I don't know yet.  I just finished.  I don't know, just try to fix my thoughts now.
