 Q. PÃ¡draig Harrington said the back nine was brutal and Ross Fisher was delighted with 1-under on the back nine; you just shot two. How? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Well, I made birdie on 10. It was did you feel. My plan was to make three or four birdies on the front nine and just try to hang in on the back nine. I was expecting myself to play 1-over if I get unlucky, maybe 2-over. But yeah, you're right. Shot 1-under, that's good. 

 Q. How are you mentally, how are you physically after last week's long Ryder Cup? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: I cannot really afford to take it easy this week, because it's a big, big week. I'm leading The Race to Dubai at the moment, so obviously I can make some more points here this week, in order to have a little advantage going into it Dubai the last tournament. 
 So it's an important week for me, but, yes, I'm tired but I slept a lot the last three nights so I'll be fine.

 Q. You went to Valhalla as an observer, a guest of Nick Faldo; how different was Celtic Manor? 
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, I was expecting that the people, the spectators are going to go wild. But I mean, I was not expecting that on the first tee. I will never forget that moment in my life.

 Q. You talked about The Race to Dubai being important, what about the idea of winning here at St. Andrews on Sunday, how special would that be to you?
 MARTIN KAYMER: I just talked to my dad about it last night. You know, obviously I was close to playing well here at the British Open. I screwed it up a little bit in the end, but I just told him, that is my biggest dream is to win a golf tournament in St. Andrews. It would be nice if it would be the Open, but I'd take any. This is a huge event for us, as well.
