   MARTIN KAYMER: A little frustrating, I make too many bogeys, I made four bogeys. It was maybe a little more difficult than the first two days but still on that golf course you should play a better rounds than 2-under par. I didn't hit a lot of fairways today so I had some trouble to hit it really close to the flag today. 
 I could have just given myself more chances but didn't really work out. Overall I was still happy with my putting but obviously if you finish with a 3-putt bogey, it's just tough. I just wanted to play a good round and put myself in a good position for tomorrow and I think I need that 61 tomorrow.
