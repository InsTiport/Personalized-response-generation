 Q.   Just talk about the round today, and on the back side, you started out with a bogey.   Everything seemed to be pretty good after that.   How did you attack the course today?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Yeah, I played very consistent.   I didn't make many mistakes, only one mistake on 10 where I pulled a gap wedge behind the green, and it's tough to make five from there.   And I didn't make any birdie putts today.   I only made two birdies and they were birdies from four feet and six feet.   So unfortunately I couldn't make a lot of putts from any distance.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the course.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   The course was very playable today.   Even the midâ€‘irons, you could be very aggressive.   You can go for the flags because the greens are very soft, and I think there's some rain coming in for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How much of a concern is that for you?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   You don't really think about it.   You can't change it so you just accept whatever comes and you deal with it at the moment.   We'll see what happens.   It can change quickly.   Usually when it rains here there are thunderstorms and we don't play anyway so I don't think it will matter too much.   
   
 Q.   What would it mean to win another PGA Championship here?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, I have won one already, so it would be nice to win as many Majors as possible.
