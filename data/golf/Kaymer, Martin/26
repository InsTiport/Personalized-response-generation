Q. How do you assess your play today?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think I did well the way I drove the ball today.  I think I missed quite a few fairways.  I've got to sort it out later on the range hopefully.  But four birdies is good on that golf course and even better only two bogeys, because you will make bogeys here and there.  It's a tricky golf course especially when the wind picks up.  I think 2-under par say good score for the first round.
Q. When you say you're going to sort it out on the range, do you know what the problem is?  Is it something you're familiar with?
MARTIN KAYMER: I think my ball position is too far in the middle, so I think I'm going to go give it a go.  I'm going to try to move it a little bit further towards my left foot and it should be okay.  That is usually the problem, and it's tough to change on the round, because you know, sometimes you have tight tee shots where you want to steer it in there and it's tricky to try something new or something, changing your swing during a tournament round.
Q. You're a past champion on this golf course.  What would you say is the most important aspect of scoring, outside of holing a few putts?
MARTIN KAYMER: You need to drive it well.  I putted very well today.  My short game was very good today, so therefore, I shot under par.  But if you hit the fairways, you should create chances.  And obviously what you said, it comes down to the putting.  You just need to keep the ball in play.  You will make bogeys.  Driving is important but it's more like a mental challenge.  You know par is a good score on 60, 70 per cent of the holes.
