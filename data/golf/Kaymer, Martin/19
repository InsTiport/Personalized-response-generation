 Q.  Out of all the tournaments in your schedule, this must be one that you really look forward to?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, it's the only tournament we really have in Germany for the last 30 years.  BMW, they are doing a great job, not only in Germany, really everywhere in the world we play golf.  But I can stay at home and sleep in my own bed, which is quite rare these days, so I take the opportunity to play in Germany.   
I like playing here.  The golf course is presented very well, so I look forward to the week.   
 Q.  How do you feel your form is at the moment?  Last week, a bit of controversy and weird setup, but before that you had a Top-10 in a Rolex Series Event.  How do you feel now?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Last week, you know, I wouldn't say you can forget about it, but you shouldn't pay too much attention to it.  Just move on and think about what's coming next.  So I thought it was fine.  I just need to see a few good results to gain confidence.   
 Q.  German fans are going to be rife, and supporting you and your fellow countrymen.  What would it mean to you to come through this week?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Well, it's summer.  You know, to make some kind of an impact for The Ryder Cup Team would be huge.  Any tournament that I'm going to play now, it will be important for myself, and obviously trying to win a second title in Germany would be huge.  I think I'm the only one who won the BMW International Open, but it was on a different golf course.  It would be nice to win it on both courses.
