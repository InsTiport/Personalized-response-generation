  Q. How was it out there?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: It was not that easy, especially the greens are really bumpy already in the morning so it's a little scary tomorrow afternoon actually. On the short par 4 I think I was very unlucky that we didn't find the ball. I kept fighting until 18 and 3-over was the best I could do today.   
 Especially the group in front of us, I saw them putting around the hole a couple of times, it was proof how bumpy the greens are. The wind was the same as we had the days before but it was stronger today and that doesn't make it easier.  
  
  Q. Are you still enjoying it like you keep telling us, the battle for The Ryder Cup?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Actually at one point, if you are playing well, if you can score, you're getting really frustrated after a while. Because you're trying so hard to play well, and you are playing well actually but you can't shoot, you can't score well.   
 Actually, that's what happened the last couple of weeks or three or four weeks now. I'm playing okay but I can't score, and that's really, really disappointing.   
  
  Q. Is that because of outside influences?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: I don't know. I don't know what happens sometimes. But I had some weird things going on last week, and this week, I don't know, I will be really happy when it's over with, The Ryder Cup. I'm trying so hard, but it's not really happening my way. But I'm trying until Sunday and then we will see. That's the only thing I can do.   
  
  Q. Are you keeping an eye on what you have to do?   
 MARTIN KAYMER: No, I just want to play. You can't do anything about the other guys. I'm just playing my game, and I'm not -- I mean, of course, it would be nice to be in The Ryder Cup team, but if it doesn't happen, I hope I have a few more chances in the future.
