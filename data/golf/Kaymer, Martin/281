  Q. Miguel Angel Jimenez is a very difficult opponent, isn't he?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Yeah, very difficult. But the way I played golf, at least the first 14, 15 holes was very good. I made a couple of really big saves, especially on 16. I had an 8-iron and I was lucky.  
  
  Q. Does that put stress to have this match extended to the 18?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: That puts stress when you go on 17, yeah, 4-up and four to go, so then all of a sudden you make a couple of mistakes, I made a birdie on 15, yeah.   
  
  Q. I thought no hole exemplifies match play like the 11th, you have to take a drop and you end up 1-putting a birdie out there, when Miguel was perfectly positioned off the tee?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: Sometimes it's absolutely crazy. I didn't want to drop it. I was thinking if he missed the green, I might have a chance. If I make five, maybe I have a chance to halve the hole.   
 He made a mistake with the chip that he didn't give himself a chance for birdie and I holed a 25-footer for birdie, so this was just very fortunate.  
  
  Q. Your front nine was close to perfection?  
 MARTIN KAYMER: I played very good golf. I made two good long putts for birdie. And I just feel good about my game.
