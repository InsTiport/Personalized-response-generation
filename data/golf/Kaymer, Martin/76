 Q.  Seven birdies in a round of 4-under, how would you assess your play today?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Played good.  Not great but I played okay.  Gave myself okay chances.  I made a couple good putts especially on the back nine.  Made three bogeys.  One was okay, the one I made on 7, and bogeys on 15 and 18, that shouldn't really happen.  But overall, 4-under par in Carnoustie is never really bad.   
 Q.  You have your father as a partner, your brother is caddying for him.  How special for you and how as a player-caddie relationship, is that all working out well?  
MARTIN KAYMER: Sometimes it's a little funny.  Maybe when they argue about shots, my dad is a feel player and if he wants to hit a 7-iron from 160, 170 meters, he hits a 7-iron.  It's not a 4-iron even though the number says it.  And they argue, so it's quite funny.   
But in the end of the day, if we can spend the week together as a family, it's very rare these days, we can play or we can do what we love to do.  We can all do it together, and then if you have weather like this, I think it's very special and very nice to do.   
 Q.  Second place in your last start, reasonable start to this tournament, as well.  Are you feeling a big end to the season coming up?  
MARTIN KAYMER: I hope so.  I would love to finish as high as possible in The Race to Dubai.  I'm playing good enough.  The second places, 10th, 12th, all that stuff, I don't really care.  I would love to pick up a win on the way home.   
There's big tournaments coming up and obviously this is big and the last three or four we play in The Race to Dubai.  I'm really looking forward to it, because if you haven't won an event, you're still hungry, and definitely am.
