  Q. Great round today. How do you feel about it?  
 DES SMYTH: Yeah, I'm delighted with a 70. I would take 70 here any day of my life.   
 My goal was to shoot a 68 or a 69. I had it at 2-under with two to play. So it was a disappointing finish. But if you gave me 70 every day here, I would be thrilled.  
  
  Q. Are the conditions that much different than yesterday, do you think?  
 DES SMYTH: There wasn't as much wind. I thought we were going to get a breeze yesterday, but we didn't, the wind blew in the afternoon. It was very hard yesterday though. Today we had a chance to play. There is a breeze blowing, but you can play it.   
  
  Q. What do you do now in preparation for tomorrow?  
 DES SMYTH: Oh, just keep practicing, see if I can get it back on the range.
