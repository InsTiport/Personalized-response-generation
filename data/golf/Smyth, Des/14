Q.  How do you feel you played today, shooting a 2 under par or a 2 under?
DES SMYTH:  Yeah, 2 under was a good round today because for the first nine holes we had all that rain.  So starting out this morning at about 9:20, it was pretty bad.  And we had it for nearly two and a half hours.

So I wasn't doing much at that stage.  I was 1 over after nine.  But I played a very good back nine.  Got it back to 3 under.  So I'm happy with my round, it improves my position anyway.
Q.  Can you describe anything you did after the break?
DES SMYTH:  Other than I had a bite to eat in between.  No, the weather cleared up, you see.  And it made the course a little more accessible for us.  Because conditions were very tough at the start.  Now there's a score out there today.  Although it's playing long, the wind has died down and the rain has stopped.  So it gives the guys a chance to score.
Q.  Do you think 18 is playing any longer than it was?
DES SMYTH:  No, it's about the same.  I hit a drive and a wood to it today.  It depends on where the wind is when you get to the tee, really.  If the wind is down you can get it with an iron.  If the wind is up, you might have to play short in two.  It just depends on where the wind is.
