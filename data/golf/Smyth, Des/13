Q.  Talk about your day?
DES SMYTH:  Great day.  Played fantastic today.  Actually I'm disappointed with 68, because I got it to 5 under after the second hole and I had a chance he at the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, just didn't make it.  Now I miss the green at 8 and made a bogey.  Typical.  But I played great.
Q.  Took three days to figure this place out?
DES SMYTH:  You could say that.  It was a hell of a challenge.
Q.  What made it so difficult, reading the greens, what was it?
DES SMYTH:  It's a difficult golf course.  If you're in the wrong place you're going to make bogeys.  As far as today, I missed two greens and made two bogeys.  If you putt from the wrong place you're going to pay for it.  If you know golf as well as we do, if you go, tee, fairway, green, it seems like an easy game.  You start missing it short side, you have no chip.  So that's what I did twice.  I knew it when I hit it from there.  I said, oh, God, this is going to be a challenge.  And I didn't manage.  So, but that's the test golf is, isn't it?  And it's as good as you can be.
