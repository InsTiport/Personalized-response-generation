Q.
Through two rounds, with two wins this year, how do you feel coming into this championship?
DES SMYTH:  Yeah, I felt confident coming in.  But I had two poor rounds.  I mean, I'm plus six, I'll have to hang around and see if I make the cut now.  I didn't play as badly as I scored.  I had an 8 on one hole and yesterday I had a double bogey early on in my round.  So I think I got a couple of big, heavy punches.

So I struggled through the rest of the 36 holes.  But if I make the cut I'll certainly go out and try and shoot some low rounds.
Q.  Is the course playing any differently than it was yesterday?
DES SMYTH:  No, it's very similar.  A little more wind than what it appeared.  I mean, if you get to the wrong side of this course, you're going to shoot plenty of shots.  There's plenty of trouble out there.  The thing is to get a couple of birdies and get a little momentum going and then you can do the business properly.  I'm afraid I didn't.
