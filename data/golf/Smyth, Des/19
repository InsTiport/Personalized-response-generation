Q.  Big win for you.  Tell me about your match today?
 
DES SMYTH:  I played very well today.  I think I was 5-under par when the game finished.  I was about 4-under par and 3-up.  And I hit a poor drive at 15, lost the hole.  But then I recovered with a couple of pars.  And I birdied 13 and 14 to get control of the game.  And Loren played all right, but he didn't get going.  I had the edge all day.  So I'm happy with my performance today. 
 

Q.  Did he not have a good day or what?
 
DES SMYTH:  Well, you know, you always have confidence, but you're playing against such good players that it just depends who plays well.  It happened to be me today, it could be him tomorrow.  That's the way golf is at this level. 
 

Q.  Talk about the excitement right now?
 
DES SMYTH:  It's very tight.  It looks like they have the edge at this moment in time.  There's only four matches left and they look like they're going to nose it out.  But we're sitting here hopeful. 
 

Q.  Did you enjoy the event this week?
 
DES SMYTH:  Yeah, what a game.  I really had a ball. It was really exciting.
