Q.   First of all, just talk about your round today. 
DES SMYTH:   Well there wasn't much to talk about.   It wasn't a very good day.   I shot 76 today.   I played nicely all week, I was hoping to get out there and shoot a low round, but I got into trouble here on and the golf course got on top of me. 

Q.   Was the course harder today?
DES SMYTH:   Not really, no.   It was a very fair golf course.   A great golf course, demanding, you can't miss the pins in the wrong places, otherwise getting up‑and‑down is very difficult.   And that's where I was most of the day, on the wrong side. 
So no, the course is terrific.   It rewards good golf.   It's one of the great courses.

Q.   And changing course, but there's a side story on practice ranges.   I was wondering, like, is there any practice range that stands out to you that's just kind of the best that you have used prior to a tournament?
DES SMYTH:   Well practice ranges vary.   I think what players like about a practice ground is good turf.   In fact the one here is great.   Because it's zoysia grass, which is a firm turf.   So it was very nice to practice off.   A lot of people go in for these sand practice grounds, but they don't work.   Because everything disintegrates.   You need something with a firm base and a nice bit of grass on top.

Q.   And is there a certain one that stands out?
DES SMYTH:   Well there is one, but it's a long way from here.   I think it's out in Qatar in the Middle East.   I remember whenever we got on that range we thought, wow, this is the best.
