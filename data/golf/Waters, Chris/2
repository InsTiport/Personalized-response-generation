Q. Got to feel good to put up a couple good scores in your hometown.CHRIS WATERS: Yeah, absolutely.  That was the goal, to come out here and make the cut and now we've done that hopefully, and just go into match play.Q. What did you do well today?CHRIS WATERS: Just kept out of trouble, kept it in the fairway, kept it in the greens.  Probably could have made a few more putts but I made a couple long ones, too, so it all evens out.Q. What was your game plan going into today?  You had a score posted.  Was there a certain mind-set that you had going into today's round?CHRIS WATERS: No, just do the same thing I did yesterday.  Go there and try to hit fairways and greens, because obviously the rough's pretty thick, so if you start missing greens, you're going to make bogeys, so did a pretty good job of hitting greens.Q. Obviously 139 is a good total and will get you somewhere in a high seed but what's your expectations going into match play?CHRIS WATERS: To win.  Absolutely, to go out there and win.Q. Have you played in one of these before?CHRIS WATERS: I played in Cherry Hills in 2012.Q. What did you learn in 2012 that helped you here this week?CHRIS WATERS: Keep it in the fairway keep it in the fairway, because you're not going to hit greens.  As firm as they are, you're not going to hold greens if you don't keep it in the fairway.Q. Is there any mental part that may have eased you into playing in this championship?CHRIS WATERS: Yeah, I think it definitely helps, having played one before, just have all the commotion; there's a lot of people out here, so just to have all the commotion and being able to hand handle that.Q. A lot of people following you around?CHRIS WATERS: Yeah, being from Georgia, all my family is here, so probably had ten or so here.
