  PETE KOWALSKI: We have Chris Waters, who unfortunately ran into Bo Andrews today, having a local match.  What happened to have had that couldn't get it turned around the way you wanted to.   CHRIS WATERS: I was hitting the ball fine and then just struggled on the greens.  The course is getting tough out there and they are starting to dry out and get a little crusty.  I think I had three 3-putts and I was 3-down, so I was giving it all away on greens. Started forcing it a little bit at the end, trying to make some shots back up but at that point, it's match play and you have to take a little bit of risk versus reward and bit me a little bit.  But still had a great time.   PETE KOWALSKI: What do you think when you saw the pairings; how did this happen in a National Championship?   CHRIS WATERS: Two guys from Atlanta, just the way the cards fell.  Going to have to beat everyone to win anyways, so start with Bo, I was hoping.  Ended up the other way around.  We both played great.   Q.  You evened the match on No. 9, and then came right back, a little bunker trouble.  Did that turn momentum around?  CHRIS WATERS: The bunker really didn't turn momentum around.  It was the 3-putt on the next two holes that got me.  I just kept hitting it above the hole, and as any USGA event, you can't hit it above the hole, right.  That's how that ends.   Q.  Overall, your experience?  CHRIS WATERS: Oh, great experience.  This is my second Am.  Obviously this one is more special just because it's in Atlanta.  I had all my family got to come out.  At Cherry Hills, everyone wasn't able to fly out there and hang out with me for the week.  So had a great time.   PETE KOWALSKI: Thank you.
