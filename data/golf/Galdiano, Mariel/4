THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Mariel Galdiano to the media center here at the Cambia Portland Classic.  You were the winner of the Monday qualifier this week.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Shot a 69.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Uh-huh.   
THE MODERATOR: So big shoes to fill after last year Brooke won this event as the Monday qualifier.  So talk about your round a little bit the other day and how you feel going into the tournament this week.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: My round on Monday was pretty solid.  I actually had 7 birdies, but I had a few hiccups on several holes.  I had two bogeys and a double.  I guess I would say I had pretty good and lucky bounces and a lot of solid shots.   
The practice rounds I've taken so far I'm feeling pretty good.  This course is in amazing shape.  It's so nice and green here.  I love it, and I can't wait to tee it off tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR: You told me this will be your fifth tournament on the LPGA and you're only 18, right?   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Uh-huh.   
THE MODERATOR: Talk about the experience you've already had.  Do you still have the butterflies going into this tournament, or are you comfortable, like this is something you've done before?   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Definitely I'm not as nervous as I was at my first LPGA event.  Still nerves on myself rather than all the other factors, like the crowds and hoopla, everything.   
I just have pressure on myself to play my best and show that I can compete with the best in the world.   
THE MODERATOR: You will be a freshman in the fall at UCLA.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yes.   
THE MODERATOR: How excited are you for that?   
MARIEL GALDIANO: I can't wait.  There are so many great alumni on tour as well.  I have great teammates there already and they can't wait for me to join in the fall.   
THE MODERATOR: You've played in three U.S. Open already.  You tied for 42nd last year.  Did you qualify this year?  Are you going to play?   
MARIEL GALDIANO: No.  I actually came in is as a first alternate this year.  I missed it by one stroke.   
No, we just called in this morning and they said I'm in line.  Pretty far down there, but that's okay.  I have this week to bounce back, so...   
THE MODERATOR: Growing up in in Hawaii, playing golf there to where you are right now, are you realizing some of your dreams out here?  Getting closer to maybe being professional in the future, but certainly going and playing collegiate golf as well.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, definitely it was a huge eye opener once I started to come to the mainland and play national events and eventually to the tour events.   
Yes, my dreams as a professional are pretty close.  I would say definitely something I'm looking forward to doing in the future.   
THE MODERATOR: Seeing the success of the younger players on tour this year - the average age of winners is just over 21 this year.   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Uh-huh.   
THE MODERATOR: Does that kind of give you a sense that that could be you, you could be one of those people that goes out and performs well and wins on the LPGA well, too?   
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, definitely.  Past winners or winners this year include like Ariya Jutanugarn, and she would play junior tournaments that I would be entering.  Same with Lydia Ko and Brooke obviously.  So, yeah, definitely shows how young the game is getting and how close we are as junior golfers, how close our dreams are and how good we can become.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  You went to Punahou?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yes, I did.   
 Q.  Because Michelle Wie went there.  Did she have much influence on you?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, definitely.  I looked up to her when I was younger.  We used to practice at the same golf course when I was really small.  I asked for her autograph once when I was just this tall.  It was so funny watching her playing with the men and the women.  It was super inspiring.   
I always get the comment of being the next Michelle Wie coming from Hawaii, so it's a nice thought.   
 Q.  Do you necessity Sydney Maluenda?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, I do.  We grew up together playing junior gold, and then she came up here for college.  She is at George Fox now.   
Yeah, we used to play a mini par-3 golf course for young golfers.  It was a good experience growing up with her.  I followed her footsteps as well and we're competitive with each other.   
 Q.  What was the Curtis Cup like for you?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: I thought it was one of my best amateur experiences.  It was so much fun.  Although we didn't get the outcome we wanted, we played with so much heart.  We lost with grace; we really did.   
It was a hard-fought battle.  I would definitely remind other golfers who strive to be the best to shoot for that as a goal.  Definitely.
