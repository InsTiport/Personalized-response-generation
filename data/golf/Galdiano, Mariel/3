 Q.  Congratulations, great round?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Thank you so much.   
 Q.  Bogey-free, did it feel good?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: I mean, I should be feeling good, but it got a little rocky after the, I think, four birdies in a row.  But I hung in there.  I wasn't able to close out with that birdie in the end, but it's all fine.   
 Q.  How far do you think your birdie putt lipped out?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: My dad said it was like four or five feet.  So I'll be practicing that in the morning.   
 Q.  No rest for the weary, huh?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: No.   
 Q.  What do you like about this golf course?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: I really like the layout.  It's very -- well, it's the same designer as the course out at Lancaster last year for the Women's Open, I played in that.  So it's a comfortable feel and comfortable look.  So I'm just able to pinpoint my approach shots and make those putts.   
 Q.  That's four birdies in a row.  Can you walk us through what you can remember of those four shots?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Okay, so it started on 18.  That was my 9th hole.  So I had a 9-iron coming in, because I hit my 3-wood fat so I was in the rough, and that was an uphill putt.  Kind of similar to this kind of putt, and I made that one.  Then I birdied the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.  Those were just really shot approach shots and just easy birdie putts.   
 Q.  So your dad's on the bag?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  How does he help you out there?  What's his job?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Basically everything.  He really knows my swing more than anyone.  I don't really see a swing coach, like a formal swing coach.   
 Q.  He's it?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, he's it.  So he reminds me of all of that, and he's the dad, obviously, so he's like, "Okay.  Just take it easy.  One try at a time."   
 Q.  He's the mental coach, the physical coach?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: He's the finance person.  He's just all of it.   
 Q.  What's his real job?  What's his day-to-day job?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: My dad's a carpenter foreman.   
 Q.  So is it just the two of you here?  Is your mom here too?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: No, my mom couldn't make it, so it's just me and my dad.   
 Q.  Is he a good player?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: No, (Indiscernible).  And I would hit like a bad shot, he'd be like, "I don't even practice all the time.  Here, let me do it," and he hits it, and it's either really good or it's really bad and I start laughing really hard (laughing).   
 Q.  So he was a good player?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: He just liked to play for fun.  He started playing with Tiger Woods.  He caught interest in it, so that's how he learned.   
 Q.  He didn't teach himself, did he?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, I guess so.  He would just go to the driving range and hit a lot of golf balls and finally he'd just go to the course after that.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) what's your traveling been like?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Kind of crazy, but not too bad at the same time.  Like going to Ireland I missed my graduation, but that's all fine, because we had a great time at the Curtis Cup.   
 Q.  What day was graduation?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: It was like June 4th, and that was like one of our playing at Portmarnock that day.  But that was a really cool experience too.  It's fine I missed high school graduation.  It's all good.   
 Q.  Do you have a jet lag trick for traveling?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Well, my dad and I, we just come out a day early and sleep in instead of -- well, they say stay up.  I'll just be miserable and cranky.  So we just devote a day to just relax and then start a normal day the next day.   
 Q.  So the key is to come early?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, pretty much.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: I used to have like, I used to be (Indiscernible) and it was for like a workout related injury, kind of.  So out of that I (Indiscernible) I wrap this one.  So I would be wearing it for kind of a long time, and then I thought (Indiscernible).   
 Q.  When do you head to campus?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Early September.  I don't remember the exact date, but early September, and then we start school the 22nd.  That's coming up pretty soon.   
 Q.  Are you ready?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Kind of like nervous but excited.   
 Q.  Do you get to live on campus the first year?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, student-athletes -- well, yeah, student-athletes are required.  It works out for me because I have a full scholarship and everything, so they take care of all of that.   
 Q.  Did you know you set a record?  Do you know that?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: No.   
 Q.  Yeah.  You set a 36-hole scoring record.  It's a pretty old championship.  Do you own many records?  How does that feel?  
MARIEL GALDIANO: Pretty good.  Kind of shocking, actually.  I thought people would be like lights out, 15-under.  But, yeah.
