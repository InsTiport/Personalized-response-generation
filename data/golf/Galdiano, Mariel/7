Q. How was your round?  How was your tournament?MARIEL GALDIANO: It was a good tournament.  I made the cut.  This is my third Open under the age of 18, so making the cut was ultimately my goal.  When I found out I just made it, I was like let's take this home.  I wasn't -- I won't be able to qualify for the Women's Amateur Championship because of this event.  Back at home is a qualifier right now.  What I had to do was make the cut and finish 72 holes, so I did that.  So I was able to make it and it's been a while since I was -- I missed the last two championships.Q. By making the cut here, you get into the Women's Am?MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, so that will be a really good tournament.Q. Did you have a score in mind?  You are obviously still in the running for Amateur?  Was that in your thought process?MARIEL GALDIANO: Yesterday it kind of was, but it was like -- I wasn't really focused on it, like I need to be low Am.  I was like just go out and whatever happens happens, just keep grinding because you never know what happens.Q. First cut you have made of the three?MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah.Q. What did the previous two do for you in terms of what have you taken away?MARIEL GALDIANO: How to handle media and the crowds and playing with the pros.  Plus I played at the Broadmoor and Sebonack and those were really tough courses.  So definitely didn't make the cut there.  It helps me to look at parts of my game that needs fixing or to work on, so that was a big bonus.Q. Should you happen to be the Amateur, what would that mean for you?MARIEL GALDIANO: That would be crazy.  I mean, I don't know what to say.  Just making the cut was a big accomplishment, being low Am would be amazing
