Q. Wow, what a match.
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Q. I'm sure you did not expect somebody to make a 30-footer and a 30-footer on you on 2 and 4.
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, I mean, like there's no words to explain that.  You just had to watch it.
Q. Obviously a great week, but this is obviously very disappointing, I'm sure.  Just kind of describe the range of emotions.
MARIEL GALDIANO: Well, I don't know how to describe it.  Obviously like she played really well, obviously, and these things happen for a reason, so it's just another learning experience for me.
Q. Obviously Muni is not your normal 64 seed in an event like this.  You probably knew you were going to be in for a dogfight because I'm sure you guys know each other.
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, definitely.
Q. What about the decision to give her the putt on the third hole.  How long was that putt would you say?
MARIEL GALDIANO: It might have been like maybe two and a half, reaching three feet.
Q. Did you think about making her putt it?
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, I did, but I was like, you know what, let's just move on.  Yeah, she'd been making like 60-footers, so I wasn't really worried about that.
Q. If you could pinpoint one thing today, what was the difference?  Was it her putter?
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, definitely at the end of our regular 18, it was just kind of normal, and then like all of a sudden she was just on fire.
Q. Is this your last event of the summer?
MARIEL GALDIANO: No, next week we drive up to Rhode Island.  I have the Junior PGA.  That's my last one.
Q. And then go back to Hawai'i first or are you going to school?
MARIEL GALDIANO: Yeah, go back to Hawai'i and then go back to school again in a few weeks.
Q. What do you think you learned this week that will help you in future match play events?
MARIEL GALDIANO: Never give up.  You know, obviously that's something super clichÃ©, but honestly, like it wasn't looking too good for me coming into the last hole, but bouncing back, and same with her, too.  You could tell there was nothing for her to lose at this point.
Q. How long was your putt at 18?
MARIEL GALDIANO: I don't know, maybe 12 feet I would say.  But it was uphill, and I saw the line.  It was kind of an easier putt for me.
