  Q. Well, Luke Donald, we've just heard what Tiger had to say, what are your feelings?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I think it was a sincere apology. Obviously I think he made it very clear that he wants media to leave his family alone, which I kind of agree with.   
 Seems like he's getting the care and the help that he needs, and hopefully he'll get the help he needs and he'll be back on Tour whenever he's better.  
  
  Q. And none of the golf media, they chose not attend that, what do you think about that?  
 LUKE DONALD: I don't really know anything about that. Obviously it's his decision, and I have no real comment on that.
