  First Round 68 (-4)  
   
  Q. Four birdies?   
 LUKE DONALD: Four birdies, no bogeys. Consistent day obviously. 3-under on my first nine, back nine, and had a couple chances on the last nine, but still, it was a solid round out there. Didn't make many mistakes.  
  
  Q. Do you feel the course is set up well for you?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I think notoriously a bomber's course; if you can hit it far, there are a few bunkers that are not in play for the longer hitters I have to work my way around the course a little bit more.   
 But you know, still, if you putt well and do everything well, you still have a chance.  
  
  Q. You showed it today, so it isn't only for longer hitters.   
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it helps, there's certainly some forced carries out there that if you can carry it 280-plus in the air, is going to make this course a little bit easier and wider.   
 I still had my chances. Could have gone even a couple more under par today, but I was happy with that.
