 Q.  As tournament host, not the start you wanted the last couple of days, your honest assessment, how is this down to just lack of competitive golf the last month or so?  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, obviously it's the first event I've played in a month.  Probably was definitely very rusty yesterday.  My short game let me down.  I didn't hit enough greens.  It wasn't the golf I was hoping for but it was nice to finish with a few birdies.  Finally made a few putts.  I thought as host, they might be able to give me another nine holes just to see if I could make the cut but wasn't to be.   
I made a few coming in and managed to roll in a couple for the crowd.  The crowds have been great.  The course is in fantastic condition.  I mean, you should have no excuse.  The greens are just absolutely perfect.  Unfortunately I'll be watching on the weekend and not playing, which is disappointing.   
 Q.  You're very proud to host this week, you'll be watching over the weekend and you'll be back doing presentation duties on Sunday?  
LUKE DONALD: I'll be around.  I'll be sticking around and looks like a great leaderboard already shaping up.  Yeah, very proud to be a part of this and be a host.  I would have loved to have played a little better but wasn't to be.   
 Q.  You're out there trying to compete, but a lot going on this week, isn't there?  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I saw a different side of what goes on to make tournaments run and to make them unique and all the different events that have been going on this week.  It's been fun to be a part of.  Obviously it's tough to juggle both of them but certainly I'm not going to make my excuses.  I should have played better than I did the last two days.
