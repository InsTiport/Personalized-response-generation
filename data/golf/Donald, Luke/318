  Q. Obviously it's a tough deal. But it looks like you were never up in the match, and then you were all square with a couple of holes to go?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I never got my nose ahead. I gave him four holes. And it's tough to win matches when you give that many holes away.   
 But I fought strong. The birdie on 17. I had a slim chance to make that putt on 18. He got me back on the long putts.  
  
  Q. What is the feeling when you hole a putt like that on 18?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it's do or die. You give it a run and hope for the best. Obviously it had a slim chance of going in. But I thought when it went in that was going to be my day.
