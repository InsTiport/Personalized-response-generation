LUKE DONALD:  Very good match, never up until the 15th.  It was a struggle for me.

Kenny played really solid, really well out of the gates, went 3, 3, 3, and was quickly 2 down.  And then played really well the last few holes, birdied 12, 13, 15 and pars on the last three were good enough.
Q.  Good putts were they, 12, 13 and 15?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, good birdies.  I made a long putt on 12, maybe 20 foot and the other two shortish, only three or four feet.
Q.  The one on 12, does that give you a boost?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, he was inside of me, probably only 10 feet away.  So that's always a big bonus psychologically.
Q.  You said you played really well?
LUKE DONALD:  I played okay the first few, I was just making solid pars, but it wasn't good enough, and Kenny got off to a fast start.
Q.  Not that everybody out here isn't a great player, but Tiger lost.  Any thoughts about not having to face him, or were you looking forward to it?
LUKE DONALD:  It doesn't really matter over 18 holes, but I think we both had pretty tough, long matches, so we'll see who can outlast each other.
