  LUKE DONALD:   We wanted to do it for Seve.   We wanted to show our grit.   We've been known not being that great in singles, and we showed that we can win.   It's going down in history.   We talk about Brookline in '99, losing that one.   We wanted to come back and show that we could win from behind, too.   I think those last two matches yesterday afternoon were such a key moment in winning the Ryder Cup.   It gave us the boost we needed.   We were able to get off to a fast start today, and we did it.   
   
 Q.   How much inspiration do you think you gave the rest of the team?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, that was my job as the guy leading off was to go out there and get the first point and put some blue on the board early.   Hopefully I gave the guys plenty of inspiration.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LUKE DONALD:   More than you think, being down 10â€‘6.   We actually thought we had a good chance, and we proved it.
