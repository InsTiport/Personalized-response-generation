  LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I'm extremely disappointed right now.   I played just lovely golf for 16 of the 18 holes today.   I just had it really under control and could have been 6‑ or 7‑under with a couple putts and obviously to finish like that, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.   A couple poor iron shots down the stretch.   
But, you know, a lot of positives today, and excited about trying to build for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Chilly morning; how difficult did this course play?  
LUKE DONALD:   It is, this course is difficult when it's warm and sunny when the ball is going far.   It was playing a little bit longer with the cold weather.   
But as I said, I just played lovely the first 16 holes or so and gave myself a lot of opportunities.   You know, I felt like I was really in control of my game.   
   
 Q.   Pat Goss, your teacher, is out here, anything you've worked on the last few days?   
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I started to make a few more putts today.   We worked a little bit on my setup in putting, and certainly started to hole a few.   Left a couple out there, but holing more and seeing more go in the hole, which is a good sign.
