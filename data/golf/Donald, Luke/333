 Q. How is the wrist now?
 LUKE DONALD: The wrist feels a lot better now, I am here this week so fortunately it was what the doctor diagnosed just a little bit of scar tissue damage and not what I most feared which was the worst when I first did it that I might have reinjured it. But according to my doctor that is virtually impossible to do that. I just moved some of the scar tissue so I just had to rest it and take some anti inflamitories and ice it down. It was a bit too sore to play last week but it is fine now

 Q. What was going through your mind at the time because that could have been a career threatening injury?
 LUKE DONALD: Yes definitely. At first I was thinking oh no not again but as soon as I spoke to my doctor he eased my mind on it. 

 Q. Thoughts on the round itself?
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it was a great start and I played pretty solid throughout. Just hit one bad drive on three and made a double there. I also had a bit of a careless bogey on the 15th but I had a few chances and it was nice to finish with a three on the 18th. 69 is a good start and it is something to build on for the week.
