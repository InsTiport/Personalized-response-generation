   LUKE DONALD:  I played quite solid - 13 greens but 33 putts undid me. I kept giving myself 20 footers for birdie. I am still encouraged. If I keep playing like that they can start dropping. There were some really tight pin positions and it was tough. The course isp laying fair but it's not easy. You have to keep the ball on the fairway but the putts are such that you struggle to get it close. 
 If I play like that tomorrow and give myself chances I hope the putts will drop and get me into this. I've had this weather before. I am not too bothered. I drink plenty water and dn't overdo the practice. The hottest I've ever played was the Walker Cup at Sea Island which was like this without any breeze. It's not an issue.
