  Q. It was a well-played front nine, had a little problem there at 12, but overall got to feel pretty satisfied with your play today?  
 LUKE DONALD: I played really well. I struggled to score on the back nine all week, and that was obviously the difference this week. But even the shots on 12 and 16, I executed them like I wanted to. Just got a hot one on 12, and still to this moment I don't know what happened on 16. I was staring that shot down. I thought it was perfect. I hit a 7-iron about 182 into the wind over the green.   
 You know, I hit good shots, but they weren't to be.  
  
  Q. Looked like that was the difficulty the last couple days. The wind was kind of swirling. You felt like it was into the wind, the next thing it turned around, so it was tough picking the right club?  
 LUKE DONALD: It was tough out there, especially today. I think it was swirling a lot. As I said, you can only control kind of the line and the strike, and I did that both pretty well on those shots. But unfortunately they both sailed over the green.
