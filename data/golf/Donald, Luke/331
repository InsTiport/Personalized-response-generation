  Q. Luke, 8 birdies on the day out there and in some tough conditions, probably the toughest we've seen all week, don't you think?  
 LUKE DONALD: Different direction to the wind and probably similar strength to the first couple of days, but I think different direction kind of caught us a little bit. But I wish I could keep playing, you know, I was just getting going, and 15 birdies the last 36 holes. I ran out of holes, unfortunately, and Brian Gay keeps making birdies. He's obviously played great.  
  
  Q. You know, if Brian Gay wasn't playing this week, you might be in a playoff?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, that's the way it goes. Obviously I didn't score well enough the first couple of rounds. I actually played decent, just didn't get much of a score going. And still a good week.   
  
  Q. 65, 66 on the weekend has got to make you feel good going into the rest of the year?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you know, I felt like my game was in a good position, even after the first few days. I felt like something good was going to happen. And lo and behold I made 15 birdies.   
 I'm swinging it better, and seeing the ball go in the hole, which is a nice feeling.  
  
  Q. Especially when you make a birdie on the 18th hole, which always makes a good Sunday, doesn't it?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yep. I'm looking forward to a couple of days off, and see you guys at The PLAYERS.
