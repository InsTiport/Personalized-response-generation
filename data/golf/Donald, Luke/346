 Q. Great round. 6 birdies, two bogeys. 68 of the that was a great finish with those four birdies in the last five holes. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, finishing on the front side I think you have a few opportunities there. 
 9 was bonus. I hit a poor tee shot there, chipped out and then holed a sand iron from about 97 yards. So that's always nice staring a five in the face and made a three. So I turned a nice round into a great round.

 Q. Lunch is going to taste nice after that?
 LUKE DONALD: Definitely, yes. So I played pretty solid today. A few too many left shots, but overall I was pretty pleased with my day.

 Q. Nice to have the putter going. Only 22 putts. Not a lot of greens, nine greens by our count. So you got the job done on a very difficult golf course. 
 LUKE DONALD: As I said, I hit too many shots left with my irons. I missed all the par-3s left and a couple of drives left and obviously scrambled well and made some good putts. The greens are very, very fast right now, but if you get it on line, they're going to go in.
