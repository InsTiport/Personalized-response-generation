Q.   Conditions a little bit easier than yesterday? 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, felt like the wind as a little bit down when we teed off, and picked up in the middle, which was nice playing the last few with a little less wind.   Didn't have to hit 3‑wood into 18 today which was nice.

Q.   What was the key to your round today? 
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I think, you know, scoring conditions were easier.   I've been putting better the last couple of days and making some putts when I need to.   That's something I haven't done really the first couple of tournaments I've played this year.   It's nice to see the ball rolling in. 

Q.   Justin and Bubba played awfully well, but at 6‑under, you have to like your position heading into the weekend. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, those guys are playing well.   Hopefully I can go low tomorrow and close the gap a little bit.
