  Q. How good a score is 68 in those conditions?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well it was windier today, the wind direction was different which made some holes easier and some holes harder but I played very solid. I have only had a couple of bogeys in the last 36 holes so my game feels pretty good. I am a little disappointed I didn't make a couple coming in. I got to five under through 12 and then just kind of stalled coming in, But still, it was a very good solid round.  
  
  Q. Do you look forward to that stretch, 10, 11, 12, because they are all birdieable holes?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yes, 10 is probably the trickiest of the par fives, it is a very tough second shot. 12 obviously they moved the tees up and people are reaching with mid-irons today so that was very accessible today and 11 you always have a chance so, yes, you'd like to make a couple there for sure.  
  
  Q. Is there any anxiety with the left wrist when you are unloading a big one from the tee?  
 LUKE DONALD: Oh I try and stay within myself - I am long enough as it is so I don't need to go after it too hard!!!  
  
  Q. How are you feeling about your position in the tournament going into the final round?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I am quite a few back. Coming into the weekend I thought if I could shoot somewhere near 130 for the weekend to have a chance. I will have to go low now tomorrow and see what happens.
