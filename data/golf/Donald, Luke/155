Q.   Obviously it was cold and windy.   How tough were the conditions?
LUKE DONALD:   Well, it was very different to yesterday, obviously.   Not much wind and very warm, and a lot firmer.   I suppose‑‑ I'm sure scoring was a little tougher today.   It was pretty cold, pretty windy.   The greens were soft, which allowed you to get to certain pins.   But overall it was tricky out there.

Q.   What's your mindset now with nobody running away?
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I think I'm in a good place.   I would have loved to have picked up a couple birdies on the back nine.   I didn't take advantage of some of the opportunities I had.   But six back is very doable.   I need to go out there tomorrow.   I think it's going to be windy again tomorrow, but if I can go out there and post something in the 60s, I think I'll be in the mix. 

Q.   Nobody is running away with it yesterday or today.   How did you play?
LUKE DONALD:   I played better today.   Yesterday I struggled a bit tee to green, had a bit more control today.   Didn't quite hole as many putts, and hence the score wasn't as good. 

Q.   How was Rory out there holding up missing three in a row now?   Did he keep his chin up? 
LUKE DONALD:   You know, I think so.   You know, he's obviously frustrated.   This game does that to you.   But you know, just having watched Rory the last few days, he's not far away.   He made a couple of careless errors and made some big numbers on a couple holes that was the difference this week.   I'm sure once he posts that one good round, that one solid run of maybe a couple rounds or a tournament, this will be a blur and he'll forget about it quickly.
