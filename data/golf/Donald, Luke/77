Q.   Sorry to say we have not seen an awful lot of you in Europe; just one of those things, isn't it?   Just the way the schedule works? 
LUKE DONALD:   It's a busy year in golf right now, and it's hard to pick and choose and try and be as successful as you can for the events you really want to win, obviously the Majors, and try and work your schedule around that.   It's hard to find time off these days. 
But certainly not complaining.   I'm pretty fortunate to be able to play in this game, but you do want to peak for the right events and that means you're going to miss a few events here and there along the way.
Certainly golf is in a good place right now.   We are very fortunate to be able to play the events we do and have the sponsors that are sponsoring the tournaments.

Q.   Is your golf in a good place right now, or transitional? 
LUKE DONALD:   It's transitional right now.   Certainly been working on some swing changes with my new coach, Chuck Cook.   Still working hard on the short game with Pat, as well. 
Yeah, change always takes a little bit of time, and I'm certainly excited about where it's heading and be a good couple weeks to test it. 

Q.   Given that you finished third here last year, where is the balance of expectations for this tournament this time around? 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I remember playing very well here last year.   I think as a rule, this course is a little bit of a bomber's course.   Sets up well for the guy that can carry it on certain holes and certain bunkers that get in positions where if you can take it over, then you are creating a little bit of a shorter shot into the green. 
I dealt with that well last year, and gave myself a good chance coming up on the weekend.   So hopefully I can do more of the same this week.
