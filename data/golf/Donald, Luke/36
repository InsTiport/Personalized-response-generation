Q. Well played, things came together for you, six birdies in nine holes?
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, obviously took advantage of the reasonably reachable par 5, the 7th.  And once I got one, I got on a really good run of holes.  Confidence was good.  I felt really good out there.  Didn't miss too many shots.  A really good, solid, steady round.
Q. Is it nice to know when the greens are as responsive as they are, that you can be attacking on this course?
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I was talking to Dean, my caddie, that the run-offs here just aren't in play at the moment because the greens are so soft.  You can kind of be a bit more aggressive into the greens because even if you miss it and short-side yourself, you can usually chip it close because of the soft conditions.
Yeah, I think in that way, you can be a bit more aggressive.
Q. You won two BMW PGA Championships just down the road at Wentworth.  What would it mean to add the British Masters title on home soil to that C.V.?
LUKE DONALD: It's always nice to play in front of great crowds like we've got this week.  Been very supportive.
And I would just love to win any tournament to be honest, but it would be a little bit more special coming here in the U.K. obviously.  It's been a little bit of a dry period for me.  I haven't won for a couple years but I would love to dearly get back into that winner's circle.
