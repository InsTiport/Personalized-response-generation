 Q.  If we could just some opening comments about your second round today.  How did it go out there?  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it was a mixed bag today, a few bogeys, a few birdies.  Overall, pretty pleased.  Seeing this is my first event back since the Sony and I really haven't had too many reps, maybe lost a little bit of focus down the stretch there the last few holes, but overall I'm in a great position and, yeah, thankful that I feel good and healthy and ready for a weekend.  It's been awhile.   
 Q.  Talk about heading into the weekend, what's your mindset like after taking such a long break and coming back on TOUR?  
LUKE DONALD: Again, the goal really this week is to play four rounds and feel pretty good at the end of the tournament.  It's been awhile since I've done that, so that is really the goal still, to go out and just kind of have some fun and appreciate being out here again.   
 Q.  It sounds like your back is doing well, are you feeling healthy?  
LUKE DONALD: I feel pretty good, yeah, so fingers crossed.   
 Q.  Is this more than what you expected when you started out yesterday?  
LUKE DONALD: In terms of, yeah, being right by the lead, probably, yeah, I had pretty low expectations.  Again, the goal was to try and play four rounds, hopefully feel pretty good about where I was with my back and continue to build reps and continue to gain some momentum so nice to be in the mix already, it's a course I know pretty well, I know how to play it, it's, my golf hasn't been perfect by any means, but missed it in the right spots when I have missed it and some good short game and pretty solid putting and I'm right up there.
