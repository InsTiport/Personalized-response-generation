 Q.  Five-under par today.  Great start to the tournament.  Get some comments.  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah.  Nice to start off like that.  Obviously to start the year, this is a course I feel like is good for me.  Didn't play very well last year, but it's nice to get off to a very solid start.   
I played decently.  I made a couple of long putts, which really helped with some momentum.  But just kept it in front of me pretty much the whole way around, and it was just a good solid round to start the year off.   
 Q.  Obviously you weren't here last week, but the discussion was all about Corrigan's piece about you and retirement.  
LUKE DONALD: (Laughs).   
 Q.  Or near retirement as it were.  
LUKE DONALD: A little bit sensational, that headline.  To put it in content, those are some fleeting thoughts seven or eight months ago.  I was feeling a bit down about my game, and I think I was in Memphis in a hard place and my wife at the time was in Paris with Michael Jordan (laughs).  I was just thinking, I need to be in a higher place in Memphis right now while she's in Paris.  That was just kind of putting it in context.   
I think everyone goes through rough periods.  Not everyone talks about it.  Obviously James talked to me about it a little bit at the end of Dubai, and I was honest with him.  I could have just said nothing.   
But yeah, I think you go through periods where -- you know, rough periods and you get down on yourself a little bit.  And whether you can find some happiness on the golf course.  And I had it the wrong way around.  I was looking to try and play good golf that would make me happy instead of being happy and then the good golf would come.  So I needed to switch that around mentally, and I think the last six months I've done a pretty good job of that.
