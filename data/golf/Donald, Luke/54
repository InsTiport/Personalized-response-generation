Q.   Thoughts on the week? 
LUKE DONALD:   A lot of positives.   It's nice to put myself back in position.   I could have played a bit better but I still would have had to shoot 5‑under just to tie with Danny.   He played really focused golf today and hats off, he's a deserved winner.

Q.   Given this is the start to the new Race to Dubai a good bit of money in the bank in a sense. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, a good start and one tournament under my belt.   If I have tournaments like this where I'm always having a chance to win, that's a good thing, so I'm happy for that.

Q.   What's next? 
LUKE DONALD:   Sony Open.   I'll start on the West Coast on the U.S. Tour and see you guys a bit later on in the year.

Q.   You mentioned the winner; some performance over the weekend. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, what was he, 12‑, 13‑under for the weekend.   Just red‑hot putter, didn't seem to miss and did everything really well.   Just drove it amazingly well around here, which it's a very tough, tight golf course.   There's a lot of trouble, and every time when the pressure is on, he hit it down the middle.   So as I said, a deserved winner.
