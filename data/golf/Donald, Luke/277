  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it's never nice going up -- I had a chance to close it out. It was probably the longest part of the week.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your play today?  
 LUKE DONALD: I played decent, I gave him a couple of holes. I three-putted 16 and the 9th. Other than that it was really steady. I still got five or six birdies and made him work for it.  
  
  Q. How much does their play influence you on the course?  
 LUKE DONALD: Not much. I tend not to look at them much. I feel if I can play my golf and play -- just keep giving myself chances, that will put the pressure on them and they kind of -- I just try to play my game. I've got to stick to my own game plan.  
  
  Q. This course doesn't suit your eye, why?  
 LUKE DONALD: There's a lot of forced carries off the tees. You can carry them. You're hitting a lot shorter irons into the greens on the 2nd, 5th, 8th, I can go through a bunch of them, if you can carry them 280 in the air, but unfortunately I had to take the long way around.
