   LUKE DONALD:  I played fine for 15 holes today.  I just played the third badly.  Poor tee shot into the bunker and wasn't much better after that.  And then I had a great tee shot on the 5th, missed the short putt there. 
 On 6, I just heard one of the clubs dropping in a bag just on my downswing.  It's not really an excuse, but just put me off a little bit and just drew it out-of-bounds and made a quick 8. 
 It's always an uphill struggle from there.  I came back pretty well after that.  I made birdies on 11, 12 and 14.  Unfortunately I hit a great drive on 15 and just pulled a 2-iron into the bush, left the ball and had to go back to the tee -- back to the fairway, rather.  It's obviously not what I was looking for.  But disappointing.  I played actually decent today, just a few holes was obviously my undoing. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  I think it was the Amateur player, Llewellyn Matthews.  Those things happen.  It was not on purpose, obviously.  Sometimes clubs don't go all the way down and they slip down.  It was just bad timing. 

 Q.  Do you hope for bad weather over the weekend? 
 LUKE DONALD:  It would be nice if a hurricane came in right now, but I don't think that's going to happen.  It was definitely a little bit tougher today with slightly more breeze.  It still felt cold.  It started to warm up the last couple of holes.  But obviously it's an uphill struggle from here.  This is not what I wanted.  I was looking for something around par or better today. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  It could be, yeah, definitely.  I've got to believe that I can go out there and shoot a couple of 66's on the weekend, because it's possible.  You just never know. 

 Q.  You spoke about rethinking about the Scottish Open for next year. 
 LUKE DONALD:  I have to think about it.  Again, it's a tough decision for me.  I like playing in Loch Lomond.  I always play well.  You'd like to play events where you feel that you can have success.  But it would be nice to maybe one year just prepare by coming over and playing some links golf for a week or so, just get the feel of it.  And that might mean foregoing Loch Lomond. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  I didn't mention it, no.  I'm sure they're aware.  You could hear it.  It was just bad timing, unfortunately, and that's the way it goes. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  No.  He's an amateur.  He's here to have fun and it wasn't his fault. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  Vijay once told me I'm undoing my grip, on the Phoenix Open, because he has very sensitive ears. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 LUKE DONALD:  I apologized and I think I did it again three holes later.
