 Q. Give us your thoughts on this afternoon, especially what happened at 12 with you. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, 12 was obviously a killer for me. It was probably the one bad swing I made out there. I just pushed it about 10 yards with a 9-iron and paid the penalty. I dug in deep and made some birdies coming in, but I think I'm going to come up a little short unfortunately.

 Q. Take us through your second and third shot at 18. 
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I had a really awkward stance there. I had to kind of hit a shot lie with my feet, and it just came out perfectly, and it was heading right at the pin, and the one shot -- one time you don't want to hit the pin, it hit the pin, and obviously when I made that chip, I gained a little bit of revenge.
