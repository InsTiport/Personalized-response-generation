Q.   Yesterday 66, today 69.   Was it three shots harder today? 
LUKE DONALD:   On the greens it was for me today.   Yeah, just putting in the afternoon, it's always tougher.   I hit a few putts I thought went in and just didn't.   That's the tricky part about teeing off late in the afternoon.   Everyone has to do it one day.   But it was tougher for me on the greens today.   That was really the difference.   I actually played a little bit better than I did yesterday.

Q.   What type of strategy do you employ when you go into the third round six shots back?
LUKE DONALD:   You know, just keep playing consistently.   I think for me it's always about hitting fairways, hitting greens, giving myself opportunities.   If I can make a few birdies early on, take advantage of some of the birdie holes and see what happens.   Six shots over two days, I feel like I'm playing good enough to try and catch Jim.

Q.   Yesterday we talked about this little stretch of golf we're in, we're playing the best players in the same fields in between majors and a World Golf Championship this week.   You also have the FedExCup Playoffs coming up.   Do you like playing seven of 11, eight of 11 weeks against the best players in the world week in and week out? 
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I don't mind it.   I've always enjoyed playing against the best players.   That's why we play the game, to see how we can do against the top guys, and I'm looking forward to this stretch.   It's nice that it's a combination.   There's a lot to play for even though it's coming towards the end of the season.

Q.   On the back end of the Playoffs is the Ryder Cup.   Will you lobby Captain JosÃ© Maria OlazÃ¡bal for who those captain's picks might be in the next few weeks or will you kind of stay away from that? 
LUKE DONALD:   If he wants my advice then I'll certainly give it to him.   I think he's got everything under control.   I think our team is looking good.   It's going to be tough playing away from home, but I'm excited about being back there.   There's nothing quite like a Ryder Cup. 

Q.   I saw a lot of consistent golf out there.   The golf course definitely played tougher in the afternoon I thought. 
LUKE DONALD:   It did.   I hit more fairways, more greens.   I haven't really counted them, but I'm guessing that's what happened.   I certainly gave myself a lot more opportunities for birdies.   But it's tough to make putts when you tee off late in the afternoon.   The greens are just not quite as good.   Yeah, fortunately I had some really good chances coming in, 15, 16, a lip‑out on 17.   You know, could have been a lot better, but it was a solid round of golf.

Q.   I thought you might have caught a spike mark on 15. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, a couple jumps someone said.   I didn't see it, but Bones said it jumped a couple times.   That's the way it goes.   I had good greens yesterday morning and really took advantage of it.   Today was not so good.

Q.   Jim is certainly impressive setting the pace, but there's still 36 holes. 
LUKE DONALD:   It's a tough course.   What Jim has done is pretty impressive, but six shots over two days, if I can keep playing like I am and giving myself these opportunities and getting the putter to work a little bit better than it did today, I think I'd be hopeful to try and close that gap.
