  LUKE DONALD:   We played solid.   They just played a little better.   Obviously only really gave them one hole on 12, and otherwise they made some great birdies.   Making birdie, the 2 on 13; they played solidly and we just didn't quite make enough putts. 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, he summed it up pretty well.   I think that, yeah, Luke hit a great putt that lipped out unfortunately.   If theirs doesn't go in, maybe a little bit different story, but that's the way match play is.   You need momentum on your side and unfortunately we didn't have it today; you know, they won. 

Q.   And the foursomes overall at the moment look fairly even split, and how is the atmosphere? 
LUKE DONALD:   It's loud, it's raucous, it's what you expect from a Ryder Cup.   As we said, it's always tough to play away from home, but the boys are hanging in there, too.
