 Q.   Luke, how did you feel about your game today?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, 68 in the end, birdied the last.   
   
 Q.   Better than yesterday.   How are you feeling?  
LUKE DONALD:   I'm feeling a lot better today.   Yesterday was a little bit of a struggle.   I didn't really have much control over the trajectory of my shots.   But today a lot better.   It was tough today, too; it was windier.   And the greens are still holding, which is nice.   So you can attack some of the pins.   I felt better about my game today, and it was nice to make a couple coming down the stretch.  
   
 Q.   As this weather deteriorates today that could end up being a really good score.   
LUKE DONALD:   The wind is starting to pick up.   I know a front is coming in.   The weekend is not going to be too nice, either; a little bit cooler and rainy.   
It's nice to be in a good position.   And I'm looking forward to potentially being in contention on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   We talked a lot on our broadcast yesterday when guys aren't playing well like you yesterday, self‑admittedly, but shooting a round even or under par, and that's the key around a golf course like this.   
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I managed my game very well.   I kind of didn't feel very comfortable over the ball, but I missed it in spots that I needed to miss it.   I think I only hit eight or nine greens yesterday, which isn't that hard to do around here, but I also putted off the fringe four or five times.   So it wasn't terrible golf, it just wasn't controlling trajectory like I'd like to, when you know you're not under control.   But I managed to squeeze out 2‑under today, which didn't hurt me.
