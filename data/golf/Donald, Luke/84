Q.   For the second time this week, you made 7 at your ninth hole; how deep did you have to dig after that?
LUKE DONALD:   You have to dig deep every hole around here.   It's a really tough test, and I like that.   I'm really enjoying the golf course, but physically and mentally, you've got to concentrate out there, and obviously a couple have really hurt me the first two days. 
Even though I'm six, seven shots back, I feel like a good one tomorrow, I'll be right back in the mix.

Q.   How do you approach the weekend from that position?   You can't really attack this golf course, can you? 
LUKE DONALD:   No, but if you take away the two bad numbers that I had, two 7s, I'm 3â€‘under and a couple off the lead.   So it's just minimising those mistakes over 18 holes and not letting a lot mentally slip out there. 
I love this place.   This is great prep for Muirfield. 

Q.   Tell us why it's great prep for Muirfield. 
LUKE DONALD:   I think just mentally and physically; it's tiring, it's a challenge.   That's what Majors are about, as well.   You know, there's some fire in the ground.   There's a little bit of run.   You have to really think about your yardages and where you're pitching the ball.   I think in that way, it's great prep.
