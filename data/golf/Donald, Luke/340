 Q. Some comments on your day? Nice start to the year. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you know, tough conditions today. It was quite blustery and a few rain showers didn't help. I played nicely today. I had a nice little run at 10, 11, 12 and made birdie, and that was my round really. 
 I played pretty solid most of the day and made a couple of silly bogeys, but I think you are going to do that on days like this. So made plenty of birdies, so it's always a good sign, swinging well, and controlling my trajectory well.

 Q. How is the wrist? 
 LUKE DONALD: It's 100% healthy and no problems with it. No soreness, no pain, no twinges. I'm very happy with how it's rehabilitated itself after the surgery. 

 Q. Great start, being back in the hunt here, just talk about what that feels like, first of the year. 
 LUKE DONALD: Obviously early, first round of the near, not to get too excited but a good, solid start. It's a course I've done well at in the past. 
 I think it will be more of the same weather tomorrow, so if you throw in another good round, you're ahead of the field.

 Q. And your schedule over the next few weeks, what does it look like for you?
 LUKE DONALD: I'm going to play quite a bit. I'm not playing Bob Hope or Pebble Beach, but I'll play everything else through Doral.
