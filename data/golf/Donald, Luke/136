Q.   Round 1 right out of the gate, 6‑under.   Just some comments on the round. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, scoring was good out there today.   It was just a matter of making some birdies to keep up.   I think any time you have conditions where it's pretty soft, good greens‑‑ ball was flying far, too, today.   Course didn't play as long as it can play.   So happy with the way I played.   I didn't particularly play very well last week but had a good lesson with my coach on Tuesday and Wednesday and hit it a lot more solid, and 6‑under was a good, solid start.

Q.   Last week was a quick turnaround.   How much of the course did you get to see with the pro‑am cut to nine holes?
LUKE DONALD:   I actually played the back nine Tuesday late afternoon, and then I played the front‑‑ first 12.   I actually got to see all of them, which is unlike most of the guys out here.
