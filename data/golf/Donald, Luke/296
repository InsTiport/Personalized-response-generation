 Q. Welcome to one of your homes, welcome back. An interesting round and then kind of the way this course is playing, isn't it? There's some bogeys out there but a lot of birdies, too. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it's certainly not an easy course, but there are opportunities out there. There's some long holes out there with tough pins, and the greens certainly aren't -- they're not firm but they're not soft, either. And you have to hit a lot of good shots to get close to these holes.
 I made a lot of birdies out there today, but three bogeys was a little disappointing just because I didn't short game it well enough from relatively simple up-and-downs.

 Q. Take a little adjusting to get used to firm, fast greens again because things have been so soft the last number of weeks on TOUR? 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, these greens aren't too fast right now. Last week's greens were really fast and they started to get firm. But this week there's some firmness that's there, for sure, and I think if we have weather like this they can get them really firm this week.

 Q. Your thoughts on the way you're playing. You've just been dynamite throughout the Playoffs so far. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, obviously played really nicely last week. Had a good chance at Barclays until the back nine on Sunday. No, it's been solid. It's nice to see that. I've been putting in the work, and it's always encouraging when the results come, as well.
