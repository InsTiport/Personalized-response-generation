Q.   Thoughts on the 69? 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, you know, it was good patience after a slow start.   I made a poor swing on No. 4.   I hit it in the water there and double‑bogey.   You know, I was 1‑over through four and kind of trying to play catch up.   Stayed pretty patient.   Made some good swings coming in and 3‑under on the back nine was pretty solid.

Q.   Highlights for you out there? 
LUKE DONALD:   Highlights, I birdied all par 5s today and hit a nice 9‑iron into 14.   Made a birdie there.   But yeah, you know, I'm seeing progress so I'm happy with that.

Q.   You're obviously playing a lot better than you were in the Match Play; what you did in the interim is obviously paying off for you. 
LUKE DONALD:   I've been working hard and seeing some improvements in the short game which is obviously a big thing for scoring for me.   So you know, definitely moving forward and nice to be shooting some decent scores. 

Q.   As it stands, you're playing with Tiger at the moment, obviously depending on what else happens; give us your thoughts on that, if that does happen. 
LUKE DONALD:   Well, it would be second time this year.   Obviously played with him in Abu Dhabi.   Today was quite a quiet one, not too many people watching.   But if I'm playing with Tiger, there will be a little bit more people, which I quite like, actually.   I like a little bit of atmosphere.   Gets you focused a little bit more, and we'll have some fun.
