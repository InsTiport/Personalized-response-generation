  LUKE DONALD:   It was a big honor for me that Ollie had enough trust in me to go out and get that first point for Europe.   That means a lot to go out first and lead the team, and I did what I had to do.  
   
 Q.   You win the first point on Sunday in a Ryder Cup in your adopted hometown of Chicago.   How would you best describe your emotions?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, it certainly helped having some local support.   It wasn't totally going Bubba's way.   I felt a lot of love from the crowd, and just feel a lot of relief that that game is over.   Bubba pushed me hard at the end there.
