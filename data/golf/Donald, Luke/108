Q.   How pleased are you to come out on top on that one? 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I had to finish strong against Marcel.   He pushed me all the way.   He really played solid today.   I threw six birdies in, but he had a couple chip‑ins and holed some long putts and made it very difficult.   It's always nice to get through that first round, and sometimes having a tough match is a good thing.

Q.   How important is experience here?
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I didn't worry because I was hitting good shots still.   I hit a couple left shots on the back nine but drove it great today, hardly missed a fairway, hit a lot of solid iron shots and putted well.   I obviously made it tough on him, too, and I just‑‑ I felt good about my game, so I wasn't worried when I went 1‑down on 12.

Q.   How was the golf course playing today?
LUKE DONALD:   It was playing really well.   There was a little bit of casual water here and there, but really considering it was covered in two inches of snow 24 hours ago, the course held up tremendously well.   It was in good shape. 

Q.   Can you talk about your match?
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, as they say, there's no easy matches out here, and Marcel really played a good match.   He threw some birdies at me.   I think I had six birdies in total and played very solidly the whole day.   I had to finish with two birdies just to keep him at bay.   But it's nice to get through that first round, and I think sometimes having a tough first round is good for you.   I felt very good about my game today and excited about tomorrow's match against Scott Piercy, I believe.
