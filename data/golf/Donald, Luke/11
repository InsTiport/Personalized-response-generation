Q. Three daughters, you're holding one right now.  And yesterday they were right there for you.
LUKE DONALD: This is always a fun week.  I come here and it's a good break and they love it.  Daycare does a great job, they take them on excursions, and they have a great time.
Q. Four back beginning the day, a double finds you six backs very quickly after the second.  Where did you muster up the courage to give yourself a chance again to finally breakthrough here?
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, obviously the worst possible start.  A double on 2, which is kind of a birdie hole.  And just never felt very comfortable on that tee shot all week.  But really happy with the grinding and the grit that I showed today to come back and give myself a chance.
Q. When do you think you'll finally break through here after five seconds and two thirds to win that jacket?
LUKE DONALD: I just keep trying.  Obviously it's a place I feel comfortable and I like and I've had a lot of success.  I've got to just keep pounding away.  And hopefully I'll get there.
Q. What did you prove to yourself to fight back like that and give yourself a look at the end?
LUKE DONALD: Just a lot of grit and determination.  And never giving up.  And I always pride myself on that, even when I'm not feeling that comfortable off the tee this week at times.  To get it through 72 holes and have a chance to win just shows that I'm -- really happy with the determination and just never giving up.
