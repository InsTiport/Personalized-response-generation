Q.  Nice way to start the tournament?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I think the course is a little tougher than it was last year, a little cooler that morning and some rain.  The rough is up a little bit more, and you know, some tough pins today.  There are a lot of pins at the back of the greens.  With the soft greens, it's hard to get to.  So I was pretty happy with 4 under.
Q.  Is that a good thing that the course is playing tougher in the context of the significance of this week for a lot of players?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, when a course is set up a little bit tougher, it separates the field a little bit.  It's not going to be just about making putts this week.  I think you have to hit good drives.  You're not going to get away with hitting them in the rough too much because it is pretty thick.  So, you know, it definitely separates the field.
Q.  What was the key to your round today, would you say?
LUKE DONALD:  I just played very consistently today.  I holed out quite well.  A couple chances    when I had chances, I kind of took them, and just kind of kept my head down and went along.
Q.  Ian Woosnam was very keen to play with you this week.  Can you give us an idea of the sort of conversations that might have been going on?
LUKE DONALD:  Oh, I think it was more like any other    any other round with anybody, really.  I think we were just chatting way a little bit, you know, going through a few things in the Ryder Cup.  We weren't really talking about pairings or anything like that, but just logistical things, like when we were leaving, stuff like that.

So it gave him a chance to look at my game more than anything and to give a few opinions on who he might want me to play with.
