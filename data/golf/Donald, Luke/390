Q.  Luke, obviously a wonderful victory for the team, but for you personally is that a little bit of revenge for last time?
LUKE DONALD:  Well, yeah, obviously Chad beat me quite comfortably two years ago, but it really wasn't about revenge, it was about getting to 14 and a half points as soon as possible.  To be honest, our main aim was to win the singles.  We had won every other -- the fourballs and the foursomes both days, and we wanted to go out there and just pretend that we weren't trying to get to just 14 and a half, we were going to get as many as we can, and it looks like the boys are doing great.

There was so much blue up there, it was just so easy -- not easy, but it was a lot easier to play seeing all that blue on the board.  It was just a great effort.
Q.  I know people have been saying all along, even though the Europeans have been up, that you had to be cautious, you had to be careful.  Did you really see when you looked at that list eight and a half points plus going to the American team?
LUKE DONALD:  It was hard to see that.  We had so much confidence as a team.  I think we truly believed that they would have to do something spectacular to come back and win today.  The team spirit has been great all week.  We knew we had 12 great players and all of them playing well.  For us not to get four and a half points today would have been tough, especially with all this crowd behind us.  I mean, the crowd has just been unbelievable.
Q.  I assume you've never seen anything like it?
LUKE DONALD:  This is unbelievable.  There's hardly any words to put into it.  The noise on the first tee this morning, I mean, it was making us all shake, I think.  It was just a brilliant feeling, and the Irish have been great.
Q.  I suspect you'll have a few more.  Thanks, Luke.  Well done.
LUKE DONALD:  Thanks.
