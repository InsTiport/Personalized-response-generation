  Q. Just seemed to be a day where it never really happened for you, especially at the start of the back nine.   
 LUKE DONALD: I hit a few loose shots. I think I ran out of steam a little bit. I think four weeks in a row on the road is starting to catch up on me. I gave it my all but yeah, I didn't hit good enough shots. I missed too many fairways today and with the greens getting as firm as they were, it was hard to control the flags and all that kind of stuff.  
  
  Q. Just a few mental errors, do you feel?   
 LUKE DONALD: I hit some good drives at the end, great drives on 14, 16 and 17.   
  
  Q. Nice recovery on 18, as well.   
 LUKE DONALD: It was a good shot. Yeah, I think I just ran out of steam a little bit.  
  
  Q. Ultimately a frustrating week but I take it you don't feel any problems?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, this is my best finish here for a while; ever, probably. I don't think I've ever sniffed the Top-10. It's progress. I had a chance to win today. I didn't play that great but it's been a good run the last three weeks.  
  
  Q. You'll definitely be fresh and raring to go presumably when you get to Augusta?   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, a little bit of time off and then back at it in a week or so. A good couple of weeks to work on it.
