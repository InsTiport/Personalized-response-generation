Q.   Seems like conditions were ripe for the picking out there and you played great golf today. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, not too much wind and obviously the conditions are soft out there.   There was quite a bit of rain last night, and we've been fortunate during the day.   A couple of nights it's rained here and made the place pretty soft.   This place stays a lot more difficult when it's firm.   But today with not much breeze and soft conditions, if you're playing well, you can make some birdies.

Q.   Is there something you've found in your game this week?
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I've been hitting the ball reasonably well most of the year, especially the last few months.   I haven't been putting as well as I would have liked.   That's usually a strength of my game, but it's kind of letting me down a little bit.   It let me down in the first round, too.   But I seem to be putting better the last two days and hopefully more of that to continue.
