  Q. Is this the kind of course that you have to get it in your mind it's going to be a fight and you have to battle 18 holes?  
 LUKE DONALD: I suppose so. It's my first time playing here. But I know 4 or 5-under won here the last time it was here.   
 So it's always going to be challenging when you have rough like this and greens as small as they are.  
  
  Q. Is a major or non-major a factor?   
 LUKE DONALD: I suppose it means more to the Canadians, obviously. You know, I see it as another great opportunity to play well and improve. That's the same every week.
