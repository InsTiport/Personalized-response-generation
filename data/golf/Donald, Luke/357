 Q.  68, 7-under par, good tournament? 
 LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, it's my first event on the PGA TOUR and to come out, and to play solidly all week, it's very encouraging.  It's just showing the work I've been doing over the off-season is starting to pay off. 

 Q.  The golf tournament today, a two-man race today with Mickelson and Quinney, you were out there making a move; were you watching the scoreboard? 
 LUKE DONALD:  I was watching it slightly, but you know, I wasn't too concerned.  Again I was just trying to stick to my own game plan, and really just try and make as many birdies as I could. 
 I made a couple -- I made a bad bogey on 5 from the middle of the fairway and kind of stopped the momentum early on.  But no, put my head down and just tried to keep making some good birdies.  It's nice to finish off with a couple. 

 Q.  How do you approach that when you're seven shots back, do you look at it as a race for third at that point? 
 LUKE DONALD:  You know, you just never know.  Some people have come back from more deficits than that, bigger deficits.  Obviously with Phil up there, you don't feel like he's going to throw away a lead.  You just never know so you keep playing as hard as you can. 
 Sometimes it works out well.  At the Target two years ago, I was eight shots back playing the final round and shot 64 and went on to win.  You try and shoot those kind of numbers Sunday and see what happens. 

 Q.  Is there a point where you kind of look at the leaderboard and realize they are not backing up any and you have a chance? 
 LUKE DONALD:  You don't really change your strategy.  I think especially this golf course, it's hard to attack too much on this course.  You know, I think your strategy is pretty similar.  You're just trying to give yourself birdie looks, and hopefully make a few.  That's all you can do.
