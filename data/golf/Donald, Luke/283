 Q. At a time when every point is absolutely crucial, describe what it feels like to win yours. 
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it feels great. Obviously I knew Jim was going to be a really tough opponent. He's a very similar player to me. He grinds it out. He put some pressure on me at the end, but I was glad to get a point. 

 Q. You played two Ryder Cups and won them both by record margins in '04 and '06. This one is tight, what do you think of the situation at the moment? 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it's tight but we have still got some about leads in and some matches behind, and there's a few close ones out there. So anything can happen but I'll go out there and cheer the boys along.
