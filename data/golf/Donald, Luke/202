 Q. It's not over yet. This is kind of exciting. Are you nervous, or what's going through your mind?
 LUKE DONALD: I'm not nervous anymore. I was over that putt on 18, obviously I knew if I made that, I might have had a possibility. Without making birdie on the last, I don't think I would have had any chance. Pretty pumped that I made that, and disappointed in a way because I didn't play my best the last three days. I really struggled, and I fought hard, but it would be tough to lose by a shot again like I did last year. But we'll have to see. I've got to have a couple things go my way.

 Q. It's almost like being at a horse race, just waiting for the thoroughbreds to finish, right?
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I guess this is what the FedExCup is all about, and it's meant to be exciting, and there's a lot of different scenarios, and I think that's probably why these early predictions back at the Barclays, there's not too much point in that because we still don't know who's going to win, and they've got two holes to play.
 Yeah, it's an exciting finish, and it's good for golf and good for the fans.

 Q. How would you assess your year? It's not over yet. I know you still have a few tournaments left, but for the PGA TOUR it's over. What a year you've had, really solid.
 LUKE DONALD: It has been very solid, obviously starting with a win at the Match Play and a couple more wins in Europe and just knocking on the door every week. Very happy with the way I played. You know, I think even in the Playoffs, I think under par I was better than anyone else. A lot of good things to build on, and we'll keep trying and win a few more tournaments.
