Q. Very early this morning, it was cooler than it is right now.  Things really got going for you?
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it was a little fresh this morning, and obviously a bright and early start to the day.  Yeah, ball wasn't traveling very far because it was quite cold.  You know, got off to a steady start and had some opportunities on the first couple.  It was a good solid day in all.  Once I made one birdie, sort of made a few more on the front side.  It was a good solid round.
Q. You had a Top-10 in the UK this year, how important would it be for you to get another one on English soil?
LUKE DONALD: I would dearly love to have a chance to win.  This is why I'm here.  I'd love to come here and get back in the winner's circle.  That's what it's all about, obviously.  I would love to play HSBC in a few weeks.  I need to stay in the Top 3 on the Race to Dubai or get in the Top-50 on the World Rankings.  So there's a lot at stake and it's nice to start off with a solid round like I did today.
Q. You are very much part of this British Masters, as it's been reinvented.  Looking at the crowds here today, it's a justified decision to bring the Tour back, isn't it?
LUKE DONALD: It is.  It's nice to see the crowds coming in groves.  They are good support out there.  It's always fun to play in front of a lot of people and England never seems to disappoint.
Q. More of the same tomorrow?
LUKE DONALD: I hope so.  A little bit warmer, a little bit later, get to sleep in.  Hopefully a good solid round to back up this one.
