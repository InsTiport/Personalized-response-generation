  Q. Not a weekend you're really enjoying, I suppose. What are the troubles out there for you?  
 LUKE DONALD: I just haven't played consistently enough, whether -- the first few days I didn't hit enough fairways. I actually played all right, I just didn't make the cut. I had a bad start. Just not quite sharp enough, and you pay the Price of it at the U.S. Open.  
  
  Q. Is it the pressure of The Open? Could it be the pressure of being No. 1 and being in The Open, is that playing a factor?  
 LUKE DONALD: There's certainly a little more pressure and more expectation. I certainly didn't feel actually nervous out there like I did any other tournament. I think it's been a busy few weeks. I played four in a role, actually had a great stretch and won a tournament and was forced to take a little bit of time off last week. And probably just wasn't quite the preparation I would have liked.  
  
  Q. No excuses, just it didn't happen this week for some reason? Anything physical?  
 LUKE DONALD: No, just in terms of regaining some energy. I was under the weather and I was obviously struggling with a bit of fatigue. So just probably took a couple more days off than I would have liked to.  
  
  Q. So one round to go. What's the best number, I guess is the key objective at this point?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you just never know when you're going to find it. You keep trying to gain a little more confidence off the tee and make a few putts. And it's something positive to fall back on in my next event. So you keep trying and we'll see what happens tomorrow.
