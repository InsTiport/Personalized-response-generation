Q.
What happened off the tee there at 18?
LUKE DONALD:  You know, I was just kind of aiming at that bunker and I just pulled it a fraction.  It wasn't a total shot, but I must have hit the tree because yesterday I pulled it left and it was fine.  It was further left than I hit today.  But it hit the tree and I had no shot.

I nearly made a good 5, but it could have been worse than a 6.
Q.
The fact that you're not playing next week, does that kind of add to the incentive this week at all?
LUKE DONALD:  I'd just like to -- I'm probably going to take two weeks off after this, so I'd like to have a good tournament and something to go home tomorrow night and enjoy the two weeks off.  Other than that, it's just a regular day.
Q.
I know you've won once before, but this field has got a lot of the top world-ranked players in it.  What would it mean if you were the one to emerge tomorrow?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, my last win was a smaller event.  It went against the Tour Championship and it was postponed to three rounds because of weather, so if I could play great tomorrow and win against a field like this, it would give me a lot of confidence.
Q.
Do you feel the need to explain that about your win?  I mean, a win is a win.
LUKE DONALD:  No one has ever asked me.  I think I'd feel more satisfactory about myself if I could win a four-round.
Q.
You've been in the last group a few times.  At San Diego you were obviously in the playoff.  Are you comfortable being among the last groups in contention?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I think this year I've given myself a lot more chances on the weekends, and that's all you can do is give yourself chances every week, and the more chances you get, the better you'll come out in the end on Sunday.

It's another day tomorrow, so I'll play solid.
Q.
At this point in your career, how nerve-wracking is it to be right around the top of the leaderboard?
LUKE DONALD:  You know, I had a few nerves on the first tee and going into the second hole, but after that you just go on autopilot and it's just like any other round.
Q.
Do you feel like kind of a drive to win -- do you put pressure on yourself, I guess, to finish strong?
LUKE DONALD:  We'll have to see.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  You've just got to be patient out here.  I mean, it's a long grind out here, and you'd like to take all your chances, and it's not going to happen all the time.  You know, I'm just glad to be in contention going into Sunday.
