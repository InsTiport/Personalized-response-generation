 Q. Looking forward to what is always a special week for you personally? 
 LUKE DONALD: Yes. I love to come back to Wentworth, to a place where I grew up and a tournament that I have been watching since i was a kid. It's the Tour's flagship event and attracts a very strong field. I had some decent success - i had a good finish last year to finish seventh and i would love to imporve on that. It's a great time of the year to be coming back and playing in a huge event. 

 Q. It is potentially huge for things like Ryder Cup, World Rankings etc?
 LUKE DONALD: It is. I mean if you can finish well here then the Ryder Cup points and World Ranking points come with it and can have a big impact on your year. 

 Q. I suppose this event really ushers in the important part of the season?
 LUKE DONALD: It does. I mean it's only a few weeks until the US Open, the British Open isn't far away and this is The European Tour's biggest event so if you can do well here then it can set on the right path for the massive events that we play over the summer months. 

 Q. Do you get any family fanfare when you come back?
 LUKE DONALD: Not really, it's more a feeling of it's nice to be home to see everyone but I try and keep my head down to be honest.
