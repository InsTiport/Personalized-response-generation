 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LUKE DONALD: I wouldn't play in it if I believed in jinxes. I see it as a challenge more than a jinx. Yeah, I'm not really a superstitious guy, so, you know. It's a great start. 

 Q. Do you think, well, what do I do now?
 LUKE DONALD: I played with Tim Clark, whose obviously won it before and he's like, when are you going to start hitting one in the water. But, no.

 Q. Don't you feel somebody's going to do it at some time?
 LUKE DONALD: You know, I wanted to make a birdie and finish strong. 

 Q. Almost holed it, didn't you?
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, almost. Almost. 
 I think these kind of things are there to change. Someone's going to break that record and hopefully it will be me. No one thought that 63 might be possible until Nick Price did it. 
 So these things happen and again, it's another little feather in the cap. I mean, it's not like winning the Tournament, but it's still nice to pick up a trophy.

 Q. Lucas Glover just said, you're holing putts, that's got to help. 
 LUKE DONALD: You're holing putts. Same thing if you're laying up on par-5s you got to come in and control the spin on some of these greens. 
 And again, I wouldn't play it if I didn't think it was good preparation. And if I believed in jinxes I probably wouldn't play it either. So that's why I'm here. 

 Q. You don't have an early tee off time. 
 LUKE DONALD: No, no.
