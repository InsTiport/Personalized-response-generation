  Q. What pleased you most about today?   
 LUKE DONALD: Everything really. I gave myself so many chances and holed a couple I wouldn't have expected but missed some and it could have been even better.   
  
  Q. Your iron play was sparkling. Was it difficult to shake the rust from the system after your honeymoon?   
 LUKE DONALD: It was tricky. First time I've taken this amount of time out in the middle of the season but my coach came in yesterday and we worked a bit on the range and it made all the difference. I hit a lot of very good iron shots today and left myself six to eight footers for birdies.   
  
  Q. What sort of target to you think you've posted?   
 LUKE DONALD: Not quite good enough but I gave it my all and I knew it was a tall stretch to pull off a win. I think those at the top would have to fold quite dramatically and it doesn't look as if that will happen.   
  
  Q. How much confidence does this give for Carnoustie?   
 LUKE DONALD: That was one of the better ball striking rounds of the whole year. It's encouraging. I know Carnoustie is a different challenge but I felt the game was very close today and that's good to know.   
  
  Q. Seems getting married has done the game a world of good?   
 LUKE DONALD: Well it hasn't harmed it, which is the good thing. It took a while to get into the swing. I was a bit off the first three days but wasn't making many mistakes. The ball was on a string today. It's nice to know the swing is there. I expected different conditions next week but it's always nice to shoot a good solid round, one of my better ones of the year, before a Major. I will have a couple of good looks at the golf course and assess what kind of shots are required. You need to be in control of the trajectory of the shots.
