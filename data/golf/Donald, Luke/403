LUKE DONALD:  Any time you can play a round that's a major without making a bogey like I did today, nothing too much is going wrong.  Obviously I got up and down a few times and made some good par putts, but played pretty solidly all in all.
Q.  You're not necessarily a long game type of player, yet you're playing the longest course in PGA history and you're playing it well, so what's been the difference in how you've been attacking the course?
LUKE DONALD:  A lot of the length comes from having four par 5s that are quite long and a few long par 3s.  The par 5s in general really are not that long.

I'm hitting 2 irons and 3 woods off a lot of the par 4s, so it's really not a course that demands a lot of length.
