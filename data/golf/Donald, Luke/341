  Q. A little too late for the tournament, but do you look at it as a jumping off point for next year?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I think I was looking for that one breakout round after my injury, and those kind of rounds give you a lot of confidence and more of a belief that you can do it again. And yeah, today was a better day obviously. I think really the first three days I hit the ball okay, I just had 97 putts and didn't get up-and-down when I should have and was actually untidy around the greens.   
 I didn't really anticipate -- I worked on that pretty hard, and maybe the last couple weeks I've been working too much on my swing and neglecting the short game a bit.   
 But yeah, I played a lot better today, made nine birdies, just one shank. But that happens.  
  
  Q. What are the expectations coming off an injury? Can you play a full schedule?  
 LUKE DONALD: I plan on playing a full schedule. My wrist feels like normal, to be honest, no pain, no soreness, and totally healed. I'm ready to go for '09 and expect a good season. I think I'll be refreshed and ready to go and reenergized and have a little bit different perspective, a bit more of a renewed energy and a bit more appreciation for the game.   
  
  Q. What was the best part about being able to be home for a month, and what did you miss the most about TOUR life?  
 LUKE DONALD: The best part about being home is being home. We travel too much and are not in one place for very long. Some time with my wife and family, it was nice to catch up and have that time. But the worst part was obviously just missing the competition, having to sit back and watch the Ryder Cup and miss a couple majors. But you deal with it as best you can.
