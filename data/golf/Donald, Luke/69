START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT









  LUKE DONALD:   I was playing pretty good, making some putts, hitting a lot of greens.   I'm struggling on three, I have a 25â€‘footer for bogey unfortunately, but happy with my start, I made some putts, I hit some good swings.   Course is in good shape. 

Q.   Tell me about the birdies?
LUKE DONALD:   Birdied 10, the par5.   Just hit it to about 12 feet and made the putt. 
Holed about a 60 footer on 17 for birdie. 
Holed another good putt for par on 18 about 25 feet and birdied No.2, hit a wedge in to about 12 feet there. 

Q.   Sounds like your game is moving in the right direction. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, it's coming.   Been doing good work with Chuck and feeling a lot more confident with my long game, and last week my short game really kicked in again.   So that's obviously a big motivator for good scoring.   So yeah, it all seems to be coming together and rounding off nicely.
