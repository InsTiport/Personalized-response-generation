  Q. 67, the shot there at 18 and one back at 12 that you managed to turn into a birdie, nicely done.   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you know, I played nicely today. I struggled a little bit getting the distance for my second shots. The wind was really swirling around, even though it's 10 or 15 miles an hour, it's tricky to get the right club and the greens are getting firmer, for sure.   
 So I was happy to keep a bogey off the card.  
  
  Q. Playing around today, you seemed like everybody was a little short today on some of the hole locations, and you were kind of short on some putts, too. And then the one at 12 had a lot of pace on it and it banged in the back of the cup?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, usually that happens when I'm a little bit more aggressive. So I'm happy with that. I made a nice putt for birdie and a nice putt on 5 for birdie. Overall pretty happy.  
  
  Q. Are you a scoreboard watcher? Your name was all over the place.   
 LUKE DONALD: I know it's pretty packed on the scoreboard, you know. A few shots separating -- at one point there was 20 guys within a shot for the lead or tied for the lead. You just go out there and try to make some birdies.  
  
  Q. One thing in particular you're going to work on to get ready for tomorrow?  
 LUKE DONALD: Not really. I feel like I'm hitting the ball well. Maybe do a little bit of stroke work on the putting green. If you can hole putts, you can usually win tournaments.  
  
  Q. It will be fun tomorrow. Enjoy it.   
 LUKE DONALD: Thanks.
