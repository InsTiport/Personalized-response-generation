Q.  Luke strong start playing the Tour again?
LUKE DONALD:  Yes, I kind of lost a bit of energy out there, and disappointing, really, to not play better in the last few holes.  But it's nice to birdie the last, at least that will make me smile a little bit.
Q.  Tired after being in contention the last couple of weeks?
LUKE DONALD:  I've been a little bit under the weather.  I've not been feeling my best the last couple days.  I think, you know, the last couple weeks is starting to catch up with me and feeling a little bit tired, but you know, just two more days and then I have a week off.
Q.  Lots of Ryder Cup chat out there between you and captain Woosnam?

DAVID HOWELL:  Well, yes, but not going to tell you what it was, it's a secret.  (Laughing.)  No, we're all going about our business to be honest.  No, not really.  You know, it's nice to spend some time with Ian.  I haven't chatted with him a lot in recent years, and obviously looking that the much more forward to the Ryder Cup in a few weeks time.
Q.  Any chance of seeing you in a pairing?
LUKE DONALD:  We paired up actually last year at the World Cup and there's no reason why we couldn't be a pairing.  We get along really well and our games seem to match each other's pretty well, so you never know.
