Q.   A round where you dropped three shots in one hole and back to level par, how do you feel about your day's work?
LUKE DONALD:   Other than that poorly played 18th hole there, was a lot of good in it.   The course is playing tough and it's playing demanding.   You've got to limit the mistakes a little bit.   You're going to make some mistakes, but you don't want to make a big number like I did. 
But I came back well, 2‑under on my back side.   Even par around here is never going to putt you out of the tournament.

Q.   Seeing an awful lot of big numbers, 8s,9s; how intimidating is this course off the tee?
LUKE DONALD:   It is intimidating.   The fairways are quite narrow.   They give you a little bit of room on the first cut but then it gets deep and then it gets really deep.   If you don't have control of your golf ball, you can shoot a high number around here pretty easily.

Q.   You contended at the U.S. Open for the first time, didn't work out on the final day, how do you reflect on that now?
LUKE DONALD:   Just with a loss of positive feelings that I got myself in position.   My game is trending in the right direction.   Majors are about having that ball control, hitting fairways and greens, and I think I'm getting closer as time passes. 
So you know, for the U.S. Open, I think there's a lot of positives came out. 

Q.   In that Adam Scott and Justin have both broken through, you've been trending alongside them through your career; do you take positives from their performance, as well? 
LUKE DONALD:   Absolutely.   You know, you look at our careers, we have each won a World Golf Championships or two, and similar number of tournaments in our careers, and I think, you know, different games, but same personality, same kind of resumÃ©.   Hopefully that's a good indication of what's to come for me.
