  LUKE DONALD:   Another pretty solid round.   I would have liked to have got a couple more; I had a couple nasty horseshoes out there and made a poor 6 on 13, the par5, where you're really trying to make birdie.   Feel like I lost a shot and a half to the field there.   
Other than that, the swing doesn't feel quite where it needs to be but I'm playing well and I'm making some birdies, but I'm going to need to go low tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Any reason for that?   The swing's not perfect or just one of those things?   
LUKE DONALD:   It's just golf.   It's not far away.   I'm still hitting a lot of good shots.   I just feel a little bit uncomfortable in terms of the synchronisation between my upper body and lower body.   
You know, I think that happens sometimes when you've had a little bit of a break.   I'm sure tomorrow and as next week goes on, it will improve every day.  
   
 Q.   Does that mean you second guess a couple of times and don't quite trust yourself?  
LUKE DONALD:   Occasionally.   Obviously it's my job to pick good targets and make solid swings, and I did a pretty good job of that.   I just made one mistake with a 3â€‘wood on 13, hit it into the water, but other than that, hit some good shots.   
Obviously Peter and Rory got off to kind of a slow start, and you know, I was right back in it.   I would have loved to have made a couple more birdies, but hopefully I'm no more than five back.   
   
 Q.   Do you set a target in that case?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I've tried to set a target this week every day and I've come close.   So I might need to set a really low one tomorrow.
