  LUKE DONALD:   Well, obviously Rory has been playing great and Lee has, too.   Both of them played extremely well last week.   But you know, personally, I played pretty solid today, just one little mistake really on 18.   Just a beast of a hole today.   I had 227 yards into that and still needed to hit 3‑wood and just pulled it a touch.   But pretty happy with the way I played, five birdies out there, and it was tricky.   
   
 Q.   Talking about the 18th, I think I heard Paul Casey putting forward this theory that they should change the par of 18 every day depending on the conditions.   
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I hit 3‑wood into 18, par 4, and 7‑iron into the first which is a par 5.   So, obviously when you get this sort of east, southeast wind, it just plays very tough.   It's been a long hole.   
   
 Q.   And in a week like this when conditions could be like this over the four days, how important was it to have a good, solid start?  
LUKE DONALD:   More for me personally.   I've struggled a little bit getting off to quick starts, and it was nice to throw in a solid round.   I was really pleased with my putting.   I holed some good putts today and that's always the key for me, if I can start rolling in the putts, then the rest is easy.  
   
 Q.   Too busy fighting the conditions today to have any chat?   
LUKE DONALD:   Oh, we chatted a lot.   We are all friendly guys and we get along well with each other.   So it was very relaxed out there.
