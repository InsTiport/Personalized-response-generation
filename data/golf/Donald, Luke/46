Q.   Luke, how is the feeling after today? 
LUKE DONALD:   For the most part, I played pretty solidly out there.   I thought this wind direction was tougher for me.   It made the long holes longer, and I didn't‑‑ I played pretty solidly.   I had some good up‑and‑downs out there but wasn't able to create enough chances.   I didn't watch the leaderboards too much, but when I saw on 16 and saw can Kjeldsen was 9‑under, that's a pretty solid round he's put together.

Q.   How would you sum up your Irish Open experience so far? 
LUKE DONALD:   So far it's been great.   Royal County Down is a place I've always wanted to play, heard so many great things about it and certainly wasn't disappointed.   This is a great links course and good to be here and supporting The Irish Open and Rory and the great job he's doing with his foundation.

Q.   Imagine you'll take a lot of positives from this week?
LUKE DONALD:   So far, so good, yeah.   I've been happy with my ball‑striking.   My putting seems a lot more solid and I'm making some putts.   I'm going to go out tomorrow and hopefully shoot a low one.   I'm not quite out of it yet but a good one tomorrow might give me still a chance.
