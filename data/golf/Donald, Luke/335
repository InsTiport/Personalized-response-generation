  Q. Another long match there into extra holes?  
 LUKE DONALD: My wife keeps telling me 'Can't you just win on the 12th or 13th one of these days to make it easier on her heart. I was just pleased to take it into extra holes after being two down with two to play but feel I just snatched this one out of nowhere.  
  
  Q. What is the mindset to turn it around?  
 LUKE DONALD: You have to be more aggressive and try and make two birdies. Luckily birdie par was enough and Vijay missed a short one on the first extra hole.  
  
  Q. How is the wrist now?  
 LUKE DONALD: Feels good. No problems when I am swinging, no soreness, nothing, so 100% fit and hopefully stay that way.  
  
  Q. Ernie Els tomorrow - thoughts on that?  
 LUKE DONALD: Ernie is a great player, big hitter and I will need to play better than I have done the last two days to win tomorrow I think. But I will hit the range and hopefully make a few more birdies tomorrow.
