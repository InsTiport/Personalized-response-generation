 Q.   Good way to finish, birdie, birdie.   You had the four birdies.   
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I birdied my last three holes, 11, 12, 13.   Those are kind of the holes you want to make an easy score if you can.   
Obviously the weather conditions are making the course a lot softer, and you can attack the pins a little bit more.   So it's playing as gentle as it might play so far, and obviously this afternoon not much wind.   If you were going to make a score, today was a good day.   I've obviously got five holes left and five pretty tough ones to finish, but really happy with the way I started my round.  
   
 Q.   Come back with the par‑3 tomorrow, right?  
LUKE DONALD:   No, I birdied 13.   I'm at 4‑under.   
   
 Q.   Oh, okay.   That's right.   What are your thoughts on your game and how you're shaping up and your mindset going into tomorrow?   
LUKE DONALD:   I'm excited to get off to a great start.   I made a great putt on 1, another good birdie on 3, and then just played the holes like they should be played.   I feel like I'm in pretty good control of my game, and it's nice to get off to such a good start.  
   
 Q.   Good to come to a course like this and then walk away the first day as a leader?  
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, I've only played two‑thirds of a round, but certainly, yeah.   That's where you want to be.   It's nice to ‑‑ four birdies today, just ‑‑ five birdies, I think I had, and one dropped shot.   And obviously taking advantage of the soft conditions.
