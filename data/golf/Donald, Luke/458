Q. Pleased with that I would assume?
LUKE DONALD:  Yes it is a little sloppy out there but I played well tee to green, didn't make much on the greens because they are tough to putt on, a lot of footprints and they kind of looked like pizzas out there! But I was pretty solid tee to green and that was good enough to get the job done.
Q. Lee said the rough was like a salad bar, so there is a real food metaphor going on out there?
LUKE DONALD:   Well I was in the rough a couple of times and made bogeys both times. So fairways were a premium out there. Hitting the greens was important too even though you weren't going to make too many putts. They haven't been able to cut the rough and you can tell yourself just standing in it here that it is six inches deep and wet and tangly, so if you get a good lie, good enough to get to the green, then you have been very lucky.
Q. Getting on top early is important in these conditions then?
LUKE DONALD:  Yes I made a nice three on the first and that got me off to a good start and I never really looked back.
Q. Do you play more conservatively off the tee then?
LUKE DONALD:  Well no, not really, I hit driver most times. The fairways are wet which makes them a lot bigger, the course is wet with no roll, so you have to pull out the driver.
Q. A very good day for the Europeans, the feelgood factor of the Ryder Cup continuing?
LUKE DONALD: Yes maybe, or maybe the wet weather and sloppy conditions, we are used to roughing it out a little bit more on the European Tour. But it is good for European golf, no doubt about that.
