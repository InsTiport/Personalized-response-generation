 Q.   1‑under and it's pretty tight leaderboard out there.   You're not far away, are you?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, right now I'm, what, five off the lead.   Yeah, so I played pretty solid today.   I think it was tough out there.   The pins, the pin locations were harder to get to and obviously quite a bit more of a breeze today made club selection quite difficult.   
But I played very steady.   The goal today was to come out and pick off a couple of the par‑5s and minimize some mistakes, which I did yesterday.   
I pretty much did that.   Other than a couple putts I could have made on the back nine, it was a pretty satisfying day.   
   
 Q.   Bubba was saying he's struggled the last two days with the speed of the greens.   He said it's not the Augusta he's used to.   How have you found it?  
LUKE DONALD:   Absolutely I would agree with him.   It's as soft and as slow as I've seen the greens.   Slow being a relative word.   
But slower than what we're used to.   And it's certainly changed some of the breaks that we're used to seeing.   Feeding the ball in from the high side, you can now take a little bit more of a run at it.   And it's hard to make that adjustment because you are so used to, especially the guys that have been here year after year, seeing how fast these greens are and how much they break and that changed a little bit this year.   
   
 Q.   If the pins were tough today, have they got any tougher for Sunday?  
LUKE DONALD:   Well, there's four pretty tough pins on most of these holes.   Yeah, there's certain pin locations that, where the ball feeds in and I think in the last three years they have tended to save those to Sunday, to make for an exciting finish.   
So the job for me is to obviously go out tomorrow and stay within touch of the leaders and hopefully I can make a run on Sunday.
