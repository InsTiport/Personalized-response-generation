Q.
(Inaudible).
LUKE DONALD:  We were running out of time.  I think tomorrow it looks okay and Tuesday definitely looks okay.  If we go into Tuesday we'll be all right.
Q.  Normally at this time on Sunday to be on the leaderboard is a good thing.
LUKE DONALD:  I had a good start the first three holes, had a good chance on 1, hit a good putt, lipped out the right side.

Made a nice birdie on 2.

I was feeling really good when I was out there today.
