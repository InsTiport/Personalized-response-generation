Q.   Could you just talk about the round today, what the conditions were like out there?
LUKE DONALD:  The conditions were a little tougher today.  Obviously it was a lit more blustery, little different direction wind.  The course is getting firmer and faster.

I think in places some of the greens are quite firm and in some places they're a little softer.  It's hard to judge which one it's going to be.  But it was tough out there.  You have to hit fairways, you have to really control your distance into the greens, and I did a good job of that.
Q.  How were the hole locations out there, hard to get close to?
LUKE DONALD:  I think compared to yesterday might have been slightly tougher.  Some were tucked behind the bunkers, but they were pinned that we've played in the past and pins that we were used to.  Some were more easily accessible.
Q.  How similar are the conditions to what they were last week?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, somewhat similar.  Obviously it got hotter today.  It was a lot more humid.  The ball was going a little bit further.

But pretty similar to yesterday and last week.  You know, kind of typical weather for this time of year.
Q.  Play well this weekend.
LUKE DONALD:  Thanks.
