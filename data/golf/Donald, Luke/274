  Q. Are you playing better day-by-day?  
 LUKE DONALD: Today was good, yeah. I played nicely. I got off to a great start, got off early, and I think that chip in on 6 was a big turning point. It looked like a tough up and down and to make that.   
  
  Q. A couple of chip-ins today?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you know, I have to work on it a lot because I'm going to have longer clubs into most greens than most people.   
 The short game has been good, and it has been tidy. I haven't given up too many holes this week. I made a bunch of birdies, too.  
  
  Q. Assess the conditions out there today, quite different?   
 LUKE DONALD: Right now it's not too bad. It's a little chillier; the sun obviously isn't out. But the wind is getting up making it a little difficult. It's a little bit different direction, too. It's switching around. We'll see how windy it gets this afternoon.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 LUKE DONALD: Trying to get a little bit more separation with my legs and my upper body, just getting that a little more synced up so they work a little bit better together. But it's a work-in-progress.   
 I spent a good month on it before examining out to Riviera last week, and it still feels like it needs a little bit more.  
  
  Q. Matt Kuchar is your most likely opponent. Your thoughts on this afternoon?  
 LUKE DONALD: Matt obviously had a great year last year and has continued this year. He's played strongly, I'm excited to be there, and hopefully I can continue the good work.
