 Q.   Good day for you?   
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, it was more like the first day.   You know, it was nice to go around this course not make a mistake, not drop a shot, and you know, I wanted to shoot five or six under, nearly got there, a couple missed putts and didn't birdie any par fives.   Could have been a really low round today.   But yeah, certainly moving in the right direction, as I said, I feel like my game has been close, and obviously starting to show with some results.   
   
 Q.   You've played golf for a long time; when you take time off, it takes reps to get back to where you want to be.   
LUKE DONALD:   Well, it's certainly a game of confidence, golf, and it's a fine line between success and finishing 30th.   I think a lot of my fans and myself, you know, have always expected me to see me in the Top‑10 and up at the top of the leaderboard every week and sometimes golf is just not that easy.   
Sometimes you have to go through some struggles and that also makes you a better player.   Obviously I have not had the results I wanted the last few tournaments, but again, I wasn't too worried because I knew I was hitting the ball pretty well and it was just a matter of time.  
   
 Q.   Much better weather conditions at start of the day, did the golf course change through the round?   
LUKE DONALD:   Certainly the greens started to firm up a bit.   Wouldn't mind if the wind got up a bit more in the next hour or two, but yeah, it was nice conditions.   It's a little swirly out there.   The wind direction is tough to pick out sometimes in amongst the trees but greens are certainly getting firmer and a little bit crustier.   
   
 Q.   Good round has put you in a decision to defend your title.   
LUKE DONALD:   Hope so.   See how the leaders do but it was nice to have a bogey‑free round today.
