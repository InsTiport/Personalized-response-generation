Q. Your personal agenda was to impress your captain; I'm sure you've done that, but is it going to be enough, do you think?
LUKE DONALD:  I hope so.  I hope he will not pick the team based on just this week.  I think this week was a built of a putting contest.  I played the par 5s poorly this week and that probably cost me winning the tournament.  I was even over the par 5s, just wasn't very good.

Still, a pretty solid week.  Every round was under par.  Hit a lot of good shots out there.  I've been playing well the last few weeks so hopefully that will continue.
Q.  You came in here a favorite with Monty to make the team, but so many people have played well, it's incredible.
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, obviously people have picked up their games since last week.  Both Alex, Fredrik and Colin have played very well.  So, we'll just have to see.  I'm hoping Bernhard doesn't pick it just based on this week.
Q.  Where would it rank in your list of achievements to make the team?
LUKE DONALD:  Oh, it would be right up there with -- it would probably be the highest achievement, actually.  Playing for a Ryder Cup is what everyone wants to do.  It's the pinnacle of professional golf.
Q.  You'd relish the opportunity even despite the pressure because it is enormous; they say they can't enjoy it because there is so much pressure.
LUKE DONALD:  I'll enjoy it if I get picked.  I'm sure there will be a lot of pressure that week.  And I've played in a couple of Walker Cups, obviously it's not the same, but I've felt that pressure before and done okay under it.  If I get picked I'll really be looking forward to it.
