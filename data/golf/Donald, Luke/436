DONALD:  Yeah, I played well.  The 18th killed me this week a little bit.  I doubled it this morning.  It's frustrating.  I was 4 over for that hole.

Three out of four rounds were pretty good.  Fourth round I just didn't    I wasn't clicking    third round I wasn't clicking.  No, it's a shame because I thought if I squeezed a 5 or 6 I might have a chance with the wind getting up.  I took driver off 17 to try to make birdie.  I lipped out on 16 and 17 for birdies and could have finished easily birdie birdie par if I had done better on 18, but a pretty solid week.
Q.  Will you take out of it the good work you did in three of the rounds, or is the golfer's life such that you will always reflect on the bad one?
LUKE DONALD:  Well, I try not to reflect on the bad one.  It's something I have been doing a lot is reflecting on the bad, looking in the past too much these past few weeks.  You've got to look forward and stay in the present.  So I'm going to try and take the good out of it.
Q.  Going forward?
LUKE DONALD:  Going forward.
Q.  What's your schedule for the next few weeks?
LUKE DONALD:  BMW and then Omega in Switzerland and then a week off and then World Match Play, and still haven't decided about the Seve Trophy.
Q.  Have you officially been told?
LUKE DONALD:  Officially I'm in.
