  Q. Martin Kaymer said you're the player to watch in the tournament this year because of your short game and then how well you're putting. I wonder if that meant anything to you?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it's a big compliment coming from the world's best ranked player right now. So you feed off comments like that.   
 I think when your peers are speaking highly about something you can feed off it and make yourself believe that you're better than you might even think you are.  
  
  Q. How is your game right now?  
 LUKE DONALD: The game is fine. I've been preparing well, I feel coming into this week I feel like I'm playing as good as I've been coming into this championship. So I have some good results behind me the last few weeks and I'm looking forward to it.   
  
  Q. You're minus five, you could win this thing, you made some putts. Anything you can take today and put it towards tomorrow?  
 LUKE DONALD: I mean, some short shots that you hit out here are similar to the course, so it's partly why I play some years. I think that it's good preparation.   
 If you're hitting wedges close it's only a good thing.
