 Q. Can you talk about what happened in the last few holes? Just sort of talk about your round and how you sit? 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it was a steady round. I kind of got what I deserved at the end. I hit a poor wedge on 17, hit it thin and even worse shot on 18. I mean, that was just one of the worst shots I've ever hit. 
 You know, it would have been nice to make that putt and be a 10. I think it would have given me a little bit -- would have been a little closer to Graeme.
 But this is a course where you can make birdies and you can make bogies. It's definitely a course that you can catch up on. I think with the conditions the way they are, I'm going to have to be pretty aggressive out there, the greens are holding and try to make a run.

 Q. Can you talk a little about the conditions? It's still pretty wet. I mean, obviously, from the rain overnight?
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it doesn't feel too wet under foot. The ball isn't rolling too far on the fairways, and the greens are softer. You're almost having to control the spin a little bit with some of the shorter irons. But, you know, that just means, you know, some of those tuck pins that are usually tough to get to, you can get to now. There's a low score out there for sure.

 Q. How does it feel this week especially it seems that everyone's been talking about you even prior to the week and as the rounds have gone by. Do you feel that extra buzz around you? How have you sort of dealt with it? 
 LUKE DONALD: A little bit of a buzz, but that's a good thing. It means I'm in the limelight, I'm playing well, I'm in contention every week, and again, I'm sort of there or thereabouts come Sunday. It's all good stuff.
