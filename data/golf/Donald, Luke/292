 Q. Sum up your position now. You had a frustrating experience on 15. Talk about that. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, you know, I decided to hit 3-wood off the tee. I thought that would kind of leave me short of the bunkers but I could still get there in two and just flared it to the right. Just laid up fine and then just hit a poor shot, third shot. 
 Really wasn't a tough shot, and I leaked it well right from 125 yards and really should have been having a putt for birdie and ended up three-putting for double. Yeah, it was frustrating to give away a couple there. But I hit a lot of good shots today. 
 It was one of those days where the putts kind of -- hit a couple wedges that could have gone in, but I'm in great position. Still just one back, and this is the last Sunday of the regular TOUR and I've got a chance to win it all. So that's nice to know.

 Q. Jim is a tough competitor. How are you going to forge ahead of him tomorrow?
 LUKE DONALD: Jim is very steady. He didn't do much wrong today, just kind of plodded his way around and picked off a couple birdies and a couple bogeys in there, too, but yeah, he'll be steady, but I know if I go out and shoot a good number, somewhere in the 60s, I'm going to have a chance.

 Q. Talk about the fruits of your entire season in a sense come down to tomorrow. Talk about that. 
 LUKE DONALD: As I said, that's a great place to be. I'd rather be there than having no chance at all. That's what makes it fun. I think it's going to be fun for the crowds, fun for the players. There's a lot that can happen tomorrow. We'll see who comes out on top.

 Q. Are you aware of the various permutations that would make you No. 1 in the FedExCup?
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I believe I have to win to win it, so that would be the goal.
