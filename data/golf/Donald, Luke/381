  Q.  What went through your mind when you won three in a row?   
 LUKE DONALD:  Well, that often happens in match play.  I think you often find yourself up against the fence, so it's said, and you get pretty aggressive.  I holed a nice chip on 14 and played 15 and 16 beautifully, just hit down straight at the hole and made some nice putts.   
 You know, I wasn't playing badly.  He was making the birdies, I was just trying to stay patient, and I knew if I kept hitting good shots I could hopefully close it out.   
  
  Q.  How important is experience in that situation?   
 LUKE DONALD:  It is, not to get too flustered.  I was 5-up with five to play.  He had to win six holes in a row to beat me.  I just knew the odds against that were pretty small.  I just kept plugging along, plugging away, and finally made a nice -- hit it pretty close on 17, sort of forced him into a mistake.   
  
  Q.  What's it like playing against quite a good friend?   
 LUKE DONALD:  You know, it's fine.  Miguel is a great guy and we chatted nicely down the fairways, but when it was time to hit shots, it was down to business.  We both wanted to win, we're both good competitors, but in the end I managed to sneak up on top.   
  
  Q.  You've played a couple times in this event, and the third round each time.  Do you think you can get further this time?   
 LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, obviously coming off a couple weeks where I've played a little indifferently, but today was a lot better.  I hit a lot of really good, solid shots and got a lot of confidence today and I've got to build on that and see where I can go.
