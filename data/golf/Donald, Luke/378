 Q.  Talk about your round? 

 LUKE DONALD:  I played nicely today.  I just had those two or three putts on three and four.  And on No. 12 my shot plugged in the bunker short and I ended up with another bogey. 

 But, overall, I played nicely. 

 Q.  Regarding conditions. 

 LUKE DONALD:  The greens quickend up significantly from yesterday and they also were a lot firmer.
