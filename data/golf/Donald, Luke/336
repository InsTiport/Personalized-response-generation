   LUKE DONALD: It was good to get that win under my belt. Neither of us played great and it was a bit scrappy but Ben really played well at the end and made it a good match. He just pulled his second shot on the first and I was able to win with a par. 
 He hit it on the green on the 15th and made birdie, I made birdie on the 16th, I messed up 17 but it looked like he would make birdie there and then he made a clutch putt there on the 18th. I was glad to get through that one. The first round is always a nervy one and you don't want to go home on Wednesday.

 Q. And how good is it to be back now after the injury problems of last year?
 LUKE DONALD: Touch wood, everything feels good and it's great to be out. I have had a solid start to the season and I expect a lot of good things over the coming weeks hopefully.
