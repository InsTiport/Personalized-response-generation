   LUKE DONALD:  It got a bit breezy towards the second half of our round.  But I think people are getting to grips with the course now and with the softer greens, it was definitely, if you hit some good shots, you could shoot under par today.   
  
  Q.  When it got harder, you played better.   
 LUKE DONALD:  Well, I think that's just the grinding aspect of it.  You know, you never give up in the U.S. Open.  You might be 10-over, and that's kind of what happened to me last year.  I was 8- or 9-over the first round, and came back and had a chance to win.  I was only a couple off the lead probably playing the back nine.   
 Just keep your head down and keep plugging away.   
  
  Q.  Do you think the first nine is something that you have to have to get you in the mode?   
 LUKE DONALD:  I would have loved to have been under par really.  Struggled a bit in practice with that kind of stretch where I didn't play well.  I'm not sure why.  I've played the back nine quite well in practice.  Hopefully figure out that little bit of stretch there and should be all right.   
 Tomorrow is another day.  I'm not too far away with my game.  I hit 9 of 14 fairways today.  You know, that's pretty decent around here.  And really, should have scored a bit better.  But that stretch of holes got me.   
  
  Q.  No wind forecast.  What will it take?   
 LUKE DONALD:  I don't know.  Take every shot as it comes and add them up at the end and hopefully I'm close.   
  
  Q.  Are you getting married next week?   
 LUKE DONALD:  Next week.   
  
  Q.  Is that going to change your schedule?   
 LUKE DONALD:  I've got three weeks off after this and I'll be back after that.
