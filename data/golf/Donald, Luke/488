LUKE DONALD:  I think the early time, you know, helped me, so I was pleased with my round today, played pretty solid golf, six birdies and just a couple bogeys.

Q.   Do you like these conditions for scoring, kind of humid, not much wind?
LUKE DONALD:  You know, I'd like it a little bit cooler, but it's the same for everyone.  I mean, the ball is traveling a little bit further, so it's making the course shorter.  If you can drive it well, you can give yourself a few more chances for birdie.  You know, I drove it pretty solidly today and holed some good putts, so it kept my round going.

Q.   How was the crowd support for you today, pretty big, pretty large?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah.  It was nice to have a good crowd and some people supporting you and shouting, "Go Cats," and stuff like that, so it's nice to be home and have some local support and some friendly faces that are familiar in the crowd.

Q.   Does that make it more important for you to play well this weekend?
LUKE DONALD:  I think every week it's important for me to play well.  It just makes it more enjoyable, I think.  Whether it's more important, I don't really think that's the case, but it's just more enjoyable to have people that, you know, you know that are coming out to support me, and it's nice when you play well to give them a little shot.

Q.   What kind of score were you hoping to put up today?
LUKE DONALD:  I'll take 68 today.  I mean, it was definitely scoreable and there was some good scores out there, but it wasn't really easy.
