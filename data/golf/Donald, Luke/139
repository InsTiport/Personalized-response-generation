  LUKE DONALD:   10 was a bad hole.   I hit it right into a waste bunker, caught a bad lie.  
   
 Q.   You didn't see any wind like this during the practice rounds.   The fact that it changed like this for today's play, how hard was that?  
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, certainly it didn't play anything like the practice days, so you had to really adapt.   I was talking with my caddie on the range if I would have rather had 2‑iron in to hit it a little bit lower.   I was thinking about putting that in and didn't.   We should have.   The course changed quite a bit and you had to adapt.   
   
 Q.   17 was a hole you had‑‑  
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, two tee shots I thought I hit pretty well.   Yesterday hard right‑to‑left wind, and the ball hung out there and hit on the edge of the green, rolled into the water.   Today I hit my line, hit where I wanted to.   It just rolled into the bunker.   Hit a pretty good shot and just missed the putt.   Again, it wasn't too many more executed shots, it's just one of those weeks.   I actually played decently this week and got nothing out of it.
