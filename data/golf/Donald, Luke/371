  Q.  What are your thoughts on the round today?   
 LUKE DONALD:  Bit of a mixed bag really.  I had five birdies, four bogeys, a little bit up-and-down.  I've always struggled a little bit on this golf course.  I've never really come to grips with the greens.  I think they are very similar to almost the West Coast greens in a way with a little bit of poa annua.  And if you're not grown up on those kind of greens, it's tough to putt on.   
 Overall, I played nicely.  Wasn't quite tight enough, though, otherwise it could have been in the 60s.   
  
  Q.  What do you feel like you need to do to really come to grip with the greens to really make a push for the weekends?   
 LUKE DONALD:  I think you just need to hole a few, just get a bit of confidence under your belt and just, you know, putting's all about confidence and seeing the ball go in and getting some good rolls.   
 I think I get a little bit jittery on these greens and lift my head a little bit too quickly, and I just need to stay down on it a little bit more.   
  
  Q.  A little bit more reserved crowd here.  Do you get the "Lukes"?   
 LUKE DONALD:  Maybe if I'm in contention on Sunday.  I think that's more overseas in America.
