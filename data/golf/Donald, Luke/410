LUKE DONALD:  I wasn't getting much out of the round but I made a nice birdie on the fourth hole and that kind of opened the floodgates. I hit a lovely 5-iron to a couple of feet on the fifth and holed nice birdie putts on the sixth and eighth. A good finish to what was very much a frustrating round.
Q.  Horrible lie on 18?
LUKE DONALD:  I couldn't have got to the green and it was going to come out low if I went for the green and had to just wedge it out and made bogey. I put in a new 60- and 54-degree wedge in this week and at the moment it's spinning too much. I think it will be good for next week but at the moment it's hard to control the spin.
Q.  Did you put it in with half an eye on next week?
LUKE DONALD:  Well, my 54 was getting pretty worn out so I knew I needed a new one. Open Championship courses are usually pretty firm so a little bit extra bite will help. I usually have a 60 and 54 in the bag.
Q.  Are you surprised no-one's got to 10- or 11-under?
LUKE DONALD:  I am surprised. I felt like I left quite a few shots out there. Perfect conditions. It doesn't get any better than this. The greens were rolling beautifully this morning and to be over par after 12 holes was not very good golf. I wasn't taking advantage of great conditions. There were birdies to have there.
