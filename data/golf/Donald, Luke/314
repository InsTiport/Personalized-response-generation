  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, it was tricky, but I made too many mistakes. Five bogeys. Made plenty of birdies. But I think the course was definitely harder. The wind being in a different direction today, maybe a little bit trickier. Some of the pins were very hard to get to, some short pins downwind.   
 So I had poor drives on 11, and pushed it a little bit on 12 and made two bogeys there, and that upset my momentum a bit. And the holes coming down, 15, 16, 17 and 18, was just very tough to make.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about your week.   
 LUKE DONALD: It's a good week. Again, disappointing not to get it done and win, but I feel like I've worked hard in the last few years. It's time for me to win again. But I'll keep plugging away and taking some things from this week. Again, I'm doing a lot of good things. And I needed to limit my mistakes today, and I would have had a chance.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it's tough. You really have to pick your times to be aggressive on the back nine. The way the wind was and where the pins were it's hard to get close to some holes. If you could the pins were hard to get close on some holes.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 LUKE DONALD: Not much more. I think it just takes that one week where everything clicks and get that relief back. The longer it goes, the harder it is. I feel comfortable that I'm working on the right things. I've had a second this year and looks like a third this week, and a couple of top-10s.   
 So I'm knocking on the door.
