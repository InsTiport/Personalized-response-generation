  LUKE DONALD:   I went bogeyâ€‘free on the weekend, I feel like there's a lot of progress object my game.   Started to drive it really well.   Saw some putts going in.   I needed to make a few coming down the stretch and just couldn't quite do it.
But a lot of progress, and happy with the way my game is trending. 

Q.   It seems look on the upswing, a few more putts go in and it could be a very interesting spring. 
LUKE DONALD:   Well, they say the first one of the year in about three weeks, so hopefully I'm peaking at just the right time.
