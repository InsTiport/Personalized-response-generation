Q.   Your thoughts, decent start, then, for you?
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, really nice start.   Obviously the course‑‑ if you're ever going to go low I think today was a good day. 
The course is soft.   The greens are soft and not as fast as they could be.   And you can took advantage of the holes you want to take advantage of.
Got off to a nice start, obviously, birdied 1 and 3.   3 is like picking up a couple of shots, I made a birdie there.   That was a 4, 3‑wood for me. 
Happy with the way I'm playing, giving myself opportunities, didn't get into too much trouble. 

Q.   It looked like you sank some nice putts out there.   Are you happy with that?
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, the greens are a lot slower than we thought they'd be, because of the rain.   And you could be an a bit more aggressive with the stroke.   I saw the lines pretty well today and made some good putts.   So made a long one on 1 and another long one on 3.   And birdies on the last three holes.   It felt nice to make when you give yourself chances.
