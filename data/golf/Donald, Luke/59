Q.   68 today, 10‑under par for the tournament, and you've heard about Thomas BjÃ¶rn making birdies out on the course today.   You had a really solid will round today.   Would you say it was stress‑free? 
LUKE DONALD:   It was stress‑free.   It probably wasn't that interesting to watch at home but the only time you play this course without making any mistakes, that's fun.   I had some chances around the middle of my round.   Just didn't quite get the putts in and didn't hit my irons really close enough. 
Obviously to birdie the last two, though, was a big momentum for me.   Probably get me into the last group tomorrow, which is where I want to be.

Q.   Speaking to John, your caddie, he said you made a couple of long putts today but not as many as yesterday. 
LUKE DONALD:   No, I think I used most of them up yesterday.   But hopefully I have a few left just for tomorrow.

Q.   You made a few changes to your game.   Is it lovely to see the results? 
LUKE DONALD:   This is obviously a place I feel comfortable around and enjoy and I've had some success around here. 
But you know, a day like today where I hit a lot of greens and made the course‑‑ not have to struggle too much out there, that's obviously a good indication that the changes are starting to bed in. 

Q.   Are you enjoying hearing "Luuuuke" a lot? 
LUKE DONALD:   Crowds are always great here.   It's what I really look forward to coming back here, is playing in front of these crowds.   They always come out and support, and they are loud and they enjoy their golf.   It's always a pleasure to play in front of them.
