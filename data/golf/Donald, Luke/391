Q.  Your thoughts on the day in general.
LUKE DONALD:  As David said, we haven't lost a session yet and that's really important.  Even though we are four points ahead, we have to go into tomorrow to try not lose the singles either.  Try and win the singles and get an emphatic victory.
Q.  Quite a partnership you and Sergio have got, haven't you?
LUKE DONALD:  Sergio is a nice partner to have.  He's a great player, obviously hits a lot of great shots.  We gelled well together today, very well.  You know, he hit a lot of good iron shots, I made some good putts out there, and we're tough to beat.

But tomorrow I'll be on my own, so it will be a little bit more different.
Q.  Tough to beat, you're impossible to beat.
LUKE DONALD:  We've never lost; hopefully it will keep going.  But it's great to help the team out.
Q.  Like you say, tomorrow you've got a four point lead but there's still work to be done out there.
LUKE DONALD:  Absolutely.  U.S. are very dangerous in singles.  We've seen this a few times.  Brookline is a great example.  They played phenomenally well to come back.  Obviously we'll have home advantage this year, and if we can get the crowd on our side, get a few blue numbers up early, I think we'll be all right.
Q.  Morale must be pretty high in the team room at the moment.
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, we're excited.  10 6 is a great position to be coming to the singles.
