 Q.   The round today, thoughts on today's round and the tournament overall?   
LUKE DONALD:   Well, I didn't hit the ball as good today as I did the previous three days.   I really could have got close today if I had holed a few putts.   I had some chances from 15 feet, that kind of range, and three or four, five of them, really, that I didn't make.   
So yeah, a lot of positives, though.   It's been a slow start to the year so it's nice to get back in the mix and obviously did a lot of good things this week.   I don't think this is a particularly great course for me, and to come here and have a chance to win is a positive thing.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the next three weeks and leading up to Augusta, what you're going to do, where you're going to play and what your thoughts are now?  
LUKE DONALD:   I'm playing next week at Tampa, then I have two weeks off.   I'll head up to Augusta the week before for a little sightseeing and just playing next week, looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   The week before, is that something you've done the last few years, going up the week before as far as preparation?  
LUKE DONALD:   I've done it a few times, yeah.   I did it last year.   I had three weeks off actually last time.   I'm playing next week instead of the Honda this year.
