Q.     Final round, a lot of people in the mix.   The weather a big issue.   How do you breakdown the chance to win and then ultimately fault just short?
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah.   I had a chance for the whole back-9 and couple, you know, untimely 3-putts on 11 and 13.   I fought pretty hard today and last couple of days.   Those were my only two bogies over the last 36 holes. 
This is a grind, this course.   Last three weeks have been pretty tough.   So, you know, it was a good effort.   Unfortunately, going to come up short.

Q.   What do you take away from this moving forward with some big ones here in the coming weeks?
LUKE DONALD:   This is a tournament I always play well at.   I feel comfortable here.   My game is coming around.   My short game is pretty sharp.   I'll build my game around that.   I'm excited about a little bit of a break coming up, couple weeks off and then get back at it at Houston.
