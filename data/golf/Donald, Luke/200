  Q. How do you feel about that, 3-under?  
 LUKE DONALD: You know, satisfying. I mean, I played decently. It wasn't that easy today. I mean, lovely conditions but the wind was strong enough to make it a little bit tricky.   
 I think it was hard to hole putts on these greens, and probably could have gone a couple lower but 69 is not a bad score.  
  
  Q. Playing alongside a good friend, Jamie Redknapp, what was he like on the course?  
 LUKE DONALD: He was all right. Took him a couple of holes to get going but got on track to make the cut. We had some fun out there.  
  
  Q. What are the challenges are playing three different courses?  
 LUKE DONALD: The speed of the greens, I think that's the hardest thing. Obviously you know, you never quite get in a routine of figuring out what the course is doing because you're playing somewhere differently, and you just adapt and especially adapt to the speed of the greens.   
  
  Q. You're on a long run of tournaments and obviously in contention motivate of the time. Is that harder physically are or mentally?  
 LUKE DONALD: I think mentally more than anything. I think I'm strong enough physically to make it through, but it's mentally a little bit tiring and I have to really try hard to focus.  
  
  Q. When is your wife due?  
 LUKE DONALD: Middle of November.
