 Q.  Luke, 1-down with six to play and you win 2 and 1.  What was the secret to the recovery? 
 LUKE DONALD:  Well, it was always a very, very close match.  There was nothing much in it really the whole day.  I made a good up-and-down on 11 and Nick missed a short birdie putt there to stay even.  Then he birdied 12 to go 1-up, but then I holed a couple putts.  I holed a nice putt on 13, maybe a 20-, 25-foot putt.  Then Nick gave me one finally on 14.  He made a bogey there.  It was a tough putt and it went in on 16, but I made about a 30-, 35-footer, and obviously sank Nick's hopes a little bit. 

 Q.  Paul Casey was telling us it was hard to play against his friend Robert Karlsson.  What about for you? 
 LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, very hard.  I think it's a tough tournament in that respect because you never want to beat someone and send a friend home, but you're obviously trying to stay out here as long as possible. 
 No, it was a good match.  I knew it was going to be a tough match, but Nick played very steady and it just came down to a couple putts at the end.
