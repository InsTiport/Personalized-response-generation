 Q.   Just a solid morning, made yourself a number of birdies.   
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, hit some good shots.   Made some putts when I needed to.   Greens are soft obviously but there was a bit more wind today, this morning.   So it was tricky.   
But happy with the way I played.   I feel like I'm starting to be a bit more in control of my golf ball, and it's nice when the putter is working, as well.  
   
 Q.   Long day today, do you need a different kind of strategy when you know you have this many holes in front of you?  
LUKE DONALD:   Not much to think about.   Just got to get out there and grind it out.   
You know, obviously hopefully take advantage of the greens this morning before they get a little spiked up, but no, just keep doing what I'm doing.   
   
 Q.   How are the conditions, after a storm like that yesterday, do you think they will get back to where the course was early in the week?   
LUKE DONALD:   Feels pretty similar to be honest.   I think it was reasonably soft earlier.   I was surprised how soft it was at the beginning of the week.   Yeah, it feels very similar to me and I don't think that will change over the course of the next couple days.
