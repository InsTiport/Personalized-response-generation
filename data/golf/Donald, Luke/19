Q. Were you familiar with the Quicken Loans Hole-In-One commercial?
LUKE DONALD: I am, yeah.
Q. How does it make you feel that you just won it for someone for this whole year?
LUKE DONALD: It's a cool initiative for Quicken Loans obviously sponsoring it.  It will make a huge deal to someone's life to have their whole year paid off.  It's a big deal and we'll know some guys financially, you know, it's always a worry with people to have that burden taken off for a year.  I think it's going to be obviously very pleasing to someone.
