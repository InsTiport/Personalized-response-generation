  LUKE DONALD:   15, that was a poor iron shot there.   Pulled it way left, lucky to find that ball really in the end and nearly made a miraculous four. 

Q.   Good recovery, wasn't it. 
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, it had whiff all over it.   Could have gone straight underneath that easily.   That was not a nice lie and to even have a chance to make par was miraculous.   If I made that putt, it would have been one of the greatest up‑and‑downs of all time. 
Yeah, other than a few iron shots, I hit a bit of a loose iron shot on 7 and 8, right, and hit a bunch of really solid tee shots and feeling good about that. 
I know when I'm starting to hit a lot more solid drives like I did today that the swing is starting to groove into a better place.   So I'm excited about that. 

Q.   Is that a reward for all of the hard work, your performance off the tee today? 
LUKE DONALD:   It is.   The last few days I've spent a bit more time grinding on the range.   I felt like my swing got a little bit out of kilter through the U.S. Open, and I needed to spend that extra time working on certain positions in my swing, and it's starting to show today for sure.

Q.   Have you had a chance to take in the leaderboard?   It's pretty heavily congested?
LUKE DONALD:   A lot of 64s and 65s out there.   68, I lost a bit of ground.
Right now, I'm four back.   Hopefully it doesn't get much more than that.   If it does I'm going to have to go extremely low tomorrow.

Q.   Does the experience of last year help?
LUKE DONALD:   Obviously the players have proved that there are low scores out there, and the leaders feel a bit more pressure and are more hesitant and I feel that I can use that a bit to my advantage to catch them up.
