  Q. Not really much we can do about this, is there.   
 LUKE DONALD: It's a shame, a shame for the fans, the sponsors, all of the helpers. It's sad. Hopefully we can get teeing off and finish today and then have a good day tomorrow.   
  
  Q. 54 holes, you understand that decision?  
 LUKE DONALD: I think so. Probably just judging on what tournament is next week, be and you know, it's better to kind of tell us early guess to get our minds around it.   
 As I say, disappointing for Barclays. This is a great event, great course, and it deserves better. I'm sure this is a bit of a one-off.  
  
  Q. It's like playing in Asia. You don't get that in Britain much.   
 LUKE DONALD: And you usually don't get lightning up here, either, which is very strange. Very bizarre circumstances and not much you can do but be patient and hope it works out.
