  LUKE DONALD:     Obviously haven't dropped a shot in 36 holes so feel good about that.   You know, obviously wasn't quite as good on the greens today.   I had some opportunities, 10‑, 15‑footers on a few holes that I just mis‑read that I hit good putts.   
But that was a solid round of golf.   I thought the course played a little bit tougher today than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   No bogeys in 36 holes, what's been the most attributable about that, the holing out?   
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah, obviously I had a couple key holes‑out yesterday.   Today I made a good par putt on 12.   
Otherwise it was reasonably straightforward.   I didn't put myself in too much trouble today, but certainly yeah, when I gave myself a little bit of trouble out on the course, I was able to recover with the putter.   
   
 Q.   We are looking at this leaderboard very excited, what about you?   
LUKE DONALD:   Well, it's a great field in general and it usually produces a really exciting weekend.   The last tournament of the year, we are looking forward to going out on a high note, and obviously Rory is playing well and a bunch of other guys are playing well.   So should make for a fun weekend.
