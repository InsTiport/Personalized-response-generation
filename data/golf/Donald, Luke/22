 Q.  An opening round of 71, how do you reflect on your play today?  
LUKE DONALD: I was happy with that score.  I thought conditions were very tough.  It's been awhile since I've played in a wind that strong.  Yeah, there were some really challenging holes, downwind and into the wind.  It was hard to stop it downwind, and obviously into the wind was a challenge as well.  I was pretty happy with that.  I putted the ball pretty well today.   
 Q.  Some of the highlights, 16 was a highlight, you're renowned for your bunker play but by your standards this was special.  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, coming back into the wind, I hit 3-wood past the pin and obviously drove that pretty well and made a nice three there.   
 Q.  You mentioned the fact, obviously it's important to hole your par putts today on a day like today, 17.  
LUKE DONALD: 17, again, playing 220.  I hit 3-wood and didn't catch it very well and came up short.  Pitched it to here, and those are nice ones to make.  Something I was missing last week, for sure.  Played decently tee-to-green but didn't make those putts so nice to see a few drop today.   
 Q.  You mentioned on Tuesday you were first reserve for The Open Championship and you're now in with Jaco Van Zyl pulling out.  How big a weight is that lifted off your shoulders knowing you don't have to try to qualify this week; you're in.  
LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I want to play well this week and have a chance to win, but yeah, it takes the pressure off.  It's nice to know where you're aiming now with your preparation, all that kind of stuff.  It wouldn't have been too much fun pitching up on Monday being first reserve and kind of hanging around waiting for someone to pull out.  So It was nice I was able to get that spot and hopefully I can make the most of it.
