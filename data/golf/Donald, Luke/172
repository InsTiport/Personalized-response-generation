Q.   Looks like you had a good day hitting fairways, you missed just a couple but you didn't hit all that many greens?
LUKE DONALD:   I really struggled with gauging the wind out there.   It was swirling around a little bit.   It changed about the ninth hole and just really struggled with just figuring out.   I hit a lot of solid iron shots that I was looking, staring them down and a couple came up short, came up short on 6.   Came up long on 16.   So just one of those tough days where I struggled to get the right distance. 

Q.   Big putt on 18 to stay in touch with the leaders, just three back. 
LUKE DONALD:   That's a tough green there, and that's not a nice putt over that hill.   But it was important to get that one in.   Three seems a lot more manageable than four.

Q.   You become world No. 1 again if you win this tournament.     What does it mean; you've been No. 1 before, would it still be a big thrill?
LUKE DONALD:   Certainly.   Obviously the main focus is to win tomorrow and if I do that, everything will kind of take care itself.   Rory has had a great run, and it will be nice put a little pressure on him.
