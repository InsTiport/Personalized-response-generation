  Q. The group, top three in the world playing together; it's almost an historic occasion on The European Tour.   
 LUKE DONALD: It is, I think we are all playing well and very competitive at the same time. Yesterday we were making birdies everywhere and it was a fun group to watch and be a part of.   
  
  Q. Last you worked with your hitting coach, Dave Alred; he's a bit busy this weekend, do you think you'll get any of his time?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, he's always got time but it will be good.   
 The first hole of the day, into a 20-mile-an-hour wind, and I was able to make birdie there. Got off to a good start. Played nicely really. Had chances on a couple of the holes but a disappointing 3-putts on the last. But a solid start. It will be tough out there this afternoon. Doesn't look like the wind is going anywhere.   
 I played nicely. I think we are all kind of feeding off each other.   
 Fast, we made I think 12 or 13 birdies between us.
