  LUKE DONALD: A little bit like yesterday, the beginning,  no momentum, we just weren't making many putts.  We were playing okay. Fifth hole  got us again. We made a bogey  there. I missed a short putt, two-foot  putt. We were not playing badly, but  then 11, again, David missed a putt and came up just a couple yards short on  13, rolled it back down the hill. Suddenly  a double-bogey and we're 3-over. 
 Nine off the lead, we were still  trying to have some fun and just give it a go and try to make some  birdies. We finished our last yesterday,  so try to do the same again. Yeah,  obviously David started rolling the putts in, which is what he's supposed to  do. That's why I picked him; he's a good  putter. He started rolling in some  putts, made a nice putt on 14 from about ten feet. He holed a good putt on 16, as well, from  about 20 feet maybe. So that got us  going.
 And then 17, obviously a birdie  there was a big bonus, tough pin back left there. David had a good drive, I hit a lovely  4-iron, just drew it in to about 15, 18 feet and he knocked that one in. So almost made one on the last. It was a good finish and that at least got us  thinking about winning again. We were a  little bit behind.

 Q.  Still think you're in?
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, foursomes, a good solid round again can  shoot you up the leaderboard.
