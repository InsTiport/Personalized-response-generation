Q.   Scores went up as well.
LUKE DONALD:   Yeah.   Nicely.   Short game did well.   I sort of bellied a wedge in on 14 and holed a bunker shot on 17.   Kind of things that get my day going and, yeah, 5-under through 10 and then the wind picking up.   It became a tough course once that happened and I was kind of hanging on a little bit.

Q.   Did it change the trajectory of the golf ball or were the greens firmed up?   What was the major problem with the wind?
LUKE DONALD:   Just strong and a little gusty.   6, I had 170 yards, hit a little 5-iron.   Just trying to keep the trajectory under the wind.   More just keeping the ball out of the wind and amongst these trees it can get a little bit swirly.

Q.   You hit 8 fairways, 8 greens and 23 putts.
LUKE DONALD:   Again, I holed a bellied wedge on 14, holed it on 17, holed it from the fringe on 18.   Those things that really helped that statistic.

Q.   Right now you have the best round of the day.
LUKE DONALD:   Well, glad about that.   This is a place I played well.   I knew if I could come out here and shoot a good score, get back in contention and have a good weekend.
