Q. Sergio, let's start with you.  Splendid round of golf with the exception of the 9th.  We saw ripples when the ball landed.  At what stage did you know that was your ball in the bank?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I did see the name on it, part of the ball, and I thought it was probably mine.  I knew it was in the hazard so I could hit it even if it was a mud ball, and I did hit it, and it came out and it was fortunately mine and almost chipped in for par.
Q.  What a battle for bragging rights, Luke; you got him in the end?


LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, it's always nice when we play together.  We've always got a friendly competition going.  Yeah, it was neck and neck until the last and I managed to squeeze back.
Q.  Sergio, you said last week that you felt the best about your game that you have all year.  Is it the same this week so far?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it's been okay.  I hit some really nice shots today and I hit a few that I would like to take back, but it happens in every round.  I feel like my form is coming around and I'm putting much better, so that's nice.  Hopefully we can keep it up this weekend.
Q.  Luke, obviously playing most of your golf in the States, we know that you'll want to qualify for the Ryder Cup through the World Points List most likely.  He's just behind you.  Are you going to hold him off?

LUKE DONALD:  Well, if I do well this week I've still got a chance to qualify for it the other way.  Either way, it doesn't matter to me.  I think we're very close on the points system right now.  It's going to be a good battle till the end.
Q.  Sergio, you played with Tiger in the last round of The Open Championship.  Do you learn anything from situations like that?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, you have to be calm, you have to stay composed and try your hardest.  Sometimes it comes out all right, sometimes it doesn't.  But that's the only thing you can do.
Q.  Talk about playing with Sergio.

LUKE DONALD:  It's great, especially when you're making a few birdies, and I think today we kept each other going.  We were making lots of birdies out there, so that always makes it a lot more fun.
Q.  That's what it looked like.  You played well except for the finish, 16 and 18, holes 7 and 9 in the round today?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it was a bit of a shame.  Unfortunately I didn't hit a bad drive on 7 but hit it just a little bit too far right, right up against the face of the bunker.  I almost made a good par.

Then we both made good birdies on 8.  Unfortunately I hit a bad shot on the left, came out of it and came up short and right.  Still nice to save a nice 5 anyway.  I'm still happy.
Q.  You're playing most of your golf in the States, now tournaments in Europe and especially Germany.  What's the biggest difference?

LUKE DONALD:  Well, it's still golf.  You're still going to make lots of birdies.  European and U.S. Tour are a little bit different.  European Tour is a little bit more social.  I like playing both sides of the Atlantic.  I think there's so many great players on both sides, and it's good to come home and be close to home sometimes.
Q.  What are your plans for the next weeks, Sergio?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I'm going to take next week off and then I'm going to go back to the States and play three in a row there, just a nice little stretch.  Then I come back for my home tournament.
