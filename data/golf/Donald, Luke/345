 Q. A little bit different from yesterday. How were you able to handle that?
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it was very tough out there with the wind. I played decently today, but I scrambled very well when I was in trouble. And I think that was the key to my round. 
 I was able to minimize bogeys on my card and I only had one on 12. I was able to get up-and-down a few times coming in down the stretch and I made a couple good birdies on 2 and 16. 

 Q. Would you like to see the rain slow it down a little bit?
 LUKE DONALD: Oh, definitely it will make the course a little bit easier. It's pretty firm out there. 17, I hit a 3-wood and moving the left-to-right wind slightly helping and it went about 320. So it's rolling out really far. So it's hard to control where it's going sometimes and that make it's difficult. 

 Q. To be in this position today, does it put more emphasis on what you were able to do yesterday to get here and kind of hang around? Guys seemed like they were scratching and clawing just to hang on to what they had. 
 LUKE DONALD: Definitely. I played with Daniel Chopra and he played 4-under and he played very well. I think that was probably one of the better rounds this afternoon. The wind really got up and anytime you have wind it's difficult. Today, this afternoon especially, it was about holding on and just not shooting yourself out of the tournament.

 Q. You guys have to do it all the time, but when conditions change from day-to-day or within a round, how hard is it to make those adjustments?
 LUKE DONALD: It seems this year we have had a lot of wind to deal with, changing conditions. It's been very tough to kind of get in a groove and get in a rhythm and I'm not sure how the weather's going to be the next two days. I know some rain's coming in tonight. But it will soften up the course and make it a little bit easier.
