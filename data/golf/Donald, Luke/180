Q.   You were clearly not at your best.   What was the problem?
LUKE DONALD:   I'm not sure where to start.   I just didn't play very well.   It's disappointing.   I've been working really hard.   To lose control of the golf ball like I did today is really frustrating, but I believe the hard work will start paying off soon.

Q.   Any sense in practice that you weren't going to play well? 
LUKE DONALD:   No, no.   I actually felt pretty good about where I was.   It's just disappointing.   Not sure what happened really.   Hopefully it was just one of those bad days.   Yeah, one of those days.

Q.   What's next for you?
LUKE DONALD:   Go take a few days off and regroup and I'll be back at Dural. 

Q.   You played a World Golf Hall of Fame 64 seed today.   How would you assess the environment in your first round?
LUKE DONALD:   I don't think it would have mattered who I played today; I just didn't play well.   I struggled.   I gave away too many holes and made too many mistakes.   You can't do that in match play against anyone, let alone Ernie. 

Q.   Is there an explanation for your unexpected poor play?
LUKE DONALD:   I think golf is like that sometimes.   It's a fickle game and sometimes it bites you.   I've not got off to the quickest start this year.   Certainly working hard and hopefully that will turn around.

Q.   Does it change your plan or schedule for Honda and Dural?
LUKE DONALD:   No, no change.   Honda will be ‑‑ Dural will be my next tournament, and then I will play Tampa as well.
