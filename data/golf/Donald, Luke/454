Q.
You were 3 under through 13 or 14?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I'm on the 14th green, I have about a 25 foot putt for birdie.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, it's a little bit wet in the fairways, but the greens are receptive.  And if you keep it in the fairways you can give yourself a good chance to be aggressive.  And I didn't miss too many fairways.  I played pretty consistent.  I had good chances on 10, 11 and 12 and missed those and then had a birdie on 13.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I came out when the rain stopped and went out on the range and hit balls for a couple of hours.  So it was kind of a day off and got a little practice in.  And again today there was obviously a little bit of a delay.  But we were pretty lucky, got in almost 14 holes.  It could have been worse.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
LUKE DONALD:  Not much you can do, really, go watch TV, hang out, have a chat with friends.
