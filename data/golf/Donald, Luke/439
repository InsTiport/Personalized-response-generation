LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I played pretty solid, just a bit untidy.  It could have been a good round, 4 or 5 under.  I made a lot of birdies and missed a couple putts.  The mistakes were just untidy mistakes really, nothing to worry about.  But I played pretty solid today, so some encouraging golf.
Q.  Just a little scrappy there?
LUKE DONALD:  A little scrappy, yeah.
Q.  A little rhythm maybe?
LUKE DONALD:  Not really.  I got off to a good start, birdied the first two holes and made a quick double bogey on 4, just hit in the rough by two inches, hit out just short, hit a poor chip that spun off the green, and I made 6.

Got a good birdie at 6, should have had a little up and down on 7 after hitting a great tee shot, and birdied 8.  It was just up and down really.

I played more solid on the back nine.  Didn't make much, got to 2 under but then bogeyed the last.
Q.  What are your thoughts for tomorrow?
LUKE DONALD:  I think if I can just shoot under par every day, 2  or 3 under, I think if it doesn't rain, these greens are going to get firm and fast and it's going to be quite hard.
