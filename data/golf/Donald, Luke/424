Q.  Close game, obviously?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, it was a close game.  I think we have somewhat similar games.  But I never got down in the match, which was key.  I think Richard hung in there pretty well.  He got a lot of good up and downs.  He holed a lot of good putts.  It was a tough match.

He made a great birdie on 14 and I followed him in.  And then on 16 was really the turning point.  We were all square and I hit it too far, a little long and to the right on the green.  I holed about a 45 footer, and he had about 20 feet and missed.

And then 17 I drove it in the right rough.  We both hit it in the greenside bunkers.  I lipped out my putt from maybe 15 feet.  He had a six footer to halve the match and three putted.
Q.  Anything in particular good today for you?
LUKE DONALD:  I just played steady.  I know I'm going to have to play a little bit better, I think, to keep progressing, but the game feels close.  Feels like it's really close.
Q.  And everybody playing here has been playing well recently.  I bet you thought it would be a tough time when you saw the draw?
LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, he's batting like a lot of straight drivers.  But we both played okay.  I wouldn't say we both played great.  We were steady, nothing too great.  But I was glad to come out with a win.
Q.  Who have you got next?
LUKE DONALD:  Shigeki.
Q.  Have you played him before?
LUKE DONALD:  A few times.  Not in match play, one on one.  He seems like a solid player.  He's a streaky player.  He can get on good streaks.  Hopefully I can get up early and keep him down.
