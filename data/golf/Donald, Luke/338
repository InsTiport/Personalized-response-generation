  Q. An interesting way to finish the day. You had the longest putt on 18 between the three guys that were up there. You're the only guy that made the putt.   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, that was pretty typical for me, that 18th hole. I hit it left in the bunker, kind of scrapped it down into the rough and then made a birdie somehow. It was pretty ugly today. I didn't hit too many quality shots out there, but I scored well, and that's part of the game, too.   
 Glad to have got in 71 shots. I think, again, it was a tough day, but I scored very well.  
  
  Q. It was difficult. Five of 14 from the fairways, you hit 9 of 18 greens, but 2 for 2 in the sand saves, and sometimes that's really what keeps a round going.   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, my short game was pretty good. I chipped in twice from the fringe on 12 and 16, so those kind of little chip-ins and getting up from the bunkers kind of keep the momentum going.  
  
  Q. I would be remiss if I didn't ask, how is the wrist?   
 LUKE DONALD: It feels 100 percent, no problems. Touch wood, it feels great.  
  
  Q. Is it a question now of just shaking off a little bit of rust?  
 LUKE DONALD: No rust. I think this is my third week out of four weeks on the road, and I think my swing has just got a little bit off. I'm going to go work on the range and hopefully fix that.  
  
  Q. English weather today, a little cold, a little rain?  
 LUKE DONALD: I think it's snowing in England, so I'll take this.
