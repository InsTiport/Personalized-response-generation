   LUKE DONALD: I thought if you were playing well you couold make a score out there. The greens were soft, a few tricky pins but in the conditions there were birdie opportunities out there and a little disappointed not to have taken a little more advantage but you are never out of it with a level par round. I drove pretty well my front nine but lost it a little on the last few drives on five, eight and nine so go to the range and try and work on it.

 Q. Full of confidence coming here?
 LUKE DONALD: Golf ebbs and flows but I was very solid on the front side, one under and could have been better but just didn't bring it home.
