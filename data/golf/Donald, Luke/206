  Q. Talk about your round, the ups and downs.   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, very happy with the way I played today, felt like I was in control of the golf ball, really did a good job with my round. I mean, I played solidly, didn't make too many mistakes.   
 And it's a tricky place. The last few holes especially were pretty tough with the rain, and it was nice to get done, and I know what I have to do tomorrow.  
  
  Q. With the FedExCup, you come into every tournament wanting to win. Everyone knows that. But is there a little added incentive or a little added pressure being that you know when you're in the top 5 and you win this tournament you're going to be FedExCup champion?  
 LUKE DONALD: There is, of course. I think not just FedExCup champion but winning the TOUR Championship, potentially Player of the Year. There's a lot of things that go along with winning this week for me and a few of the other guys. I'm sure there's a little bit of added pressure. That's why I was kind of proud of the way I played today.  
  
  Q. Finally done with this round today, concentrating on tomorrow. What's the goal tomorrow, just play every day like it's the next?  
 LUKE DONALD: If I could shoot under three rounds at 4-under par, I think I'd be in good shape. But just take it day by day, hopefully come out and hit the ball like I did today. I felt like I was really striking it solidly, didn't do a lot wrong, and hopefully more of that for the next few days.
