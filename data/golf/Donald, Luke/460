LUKE DONALD:  I had a really good chance to win, the last six holes to play, but I had a couple of bad swings that cost me dearly and I let it slip away.
Q.
You had a 6 iron on 14.  What happened there?
LUKE DONALD:  It kind of quit to the right.  I needed a good solid 6 and I got a bit too aggressive and hit it too well, it started turning with the wind and it was gone.
Q.
You've won out here before.  You won a couple of times last year on the European Tour, do you think you play better coming down the stretch?
LUKE DONALD: Yes.  I expected to play better.  I played spotless golf for three and a half years.  It was obviously just a couple of shots, but those two shots cost me dearly and I'll learn from those mistakes.
