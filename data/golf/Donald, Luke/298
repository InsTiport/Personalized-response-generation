 Q. Bogeys on the back side were frustrating today, but all in all a solid round of golf. 
 LUKE DONALD: It was. I got off to a great start, and I just didn't play quite solid enough from 9 onward, wasn't getting it in the fairway enough, and with the greens getting firmer, it's tough to get a ball anywhere near the hole. I was having some birdie putts from 40 feet and then obviously missed a few short ones on 14, 15 and 16. But Charley played a phenomenal round, and he would have been hard to catch. 

 Q. Big event for you next week going out to BMW, a home game of sorts. 
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I get to sleep in my own bed, be home, which is nice. We have a good support group there; lots of family and friends come out and watch, so it'll be a fun week. 
 Obviously this is a great week in some regards in terms of FedExCup. I've definitely moved up and pretty much secured my place in the TOUR Championship. Some positives out of this week, four rounds in the 60s, and it was all in all a solid week.
