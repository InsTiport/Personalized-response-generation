  Q. Can you tell us what happened?  
 LUKE DONALD: Well, I hit my tee shot on 17 and for the first time since coming back I felt a little twinge in my wrist. It didn't feel great when I hit that bunker shot, either. So rather than risk it, I wanted to play it safe and concede the match to Ernie.  
  
  Q. It literally just came up on that hole?  
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, one shot, and sometimes that's what it takes. I'll have to go get it checked out. Hopefully I've just pulled it a little bit and nothing serious.  
  
  Q. How disappointing in that you had a chance coming down 18 and came down 19 yesterday and won.   
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, it was a good match. I feel like I played my best golf today than all the other matches, but Ernie played good, too, and who knows what would have happened.  
  
  Q. Where to now, you're going to see a doctor and get it checked out straight away?  
 LUKE DONALD: Probably. I'll probably head to New York tonight.   
  
  Q. Just a little background on the wrist injury, the initial injury and what the procedure was.   
 LUKE DONALD: I tore the tendon sheath, EC tendon sheath, and they pretty much just sewed it up. Hopefully I haven't damaged it again.
