 Q. What happened at 18?
 LUKE DONALD: Yeah, I thought I hit a great 8-iron right at the pin and it came up maybe two yards short of being perfect, kicked back in the middle of the trap and just got a little bit too cute. Hit a poor bunker shot, another poor chip and lipped out the putt. So taking 4 from literally 20 feet wasn't what I was hoping for. 

 Q. Sunday you win the playoff. Where do you go, right to the airport? 
 LUKE DONALD: No, flights back here leave in the morning, so I stayed at a hotel, had a few drinks with some friends and flew back to Chicago Monday.

 Q. Does it feel any different being the No. 1 player?
 LUKE DONALD: A little bit. It feels good. I mean, it feels -- I'm excited to be there and looking forward to the challenges and excited to hopefully keep playing the way I've been playing.

 Q. Did Phil say anything to you about it?
 LUKE DONALD: He just said good playing from last week.

 Q. Any feedback from the fans out there?
 LUKE DONALD: You know, yeah, a few. Certainly a lot of -- well, a lot of people just saying congrats. I heard a few "No. 1" shouts and stuff like that, so you feed off that.
