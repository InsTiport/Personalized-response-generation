   LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, just nothing really going.  Didn't get any nice momentum on my first nine.  Playing okay.  You know, a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, but 3-putted 15 for bogey and then 18, well that's just a tough hole.  I had to hit 2-iron in there.  Didn't get up-and-down from the right bunker. 
 But came back nicely.  Pleased with the way I finished.  I birdied 1, 2, 4 and 6.  So yeah, it's pretty close to being good.  Not a very favorable course, but if I am maybe six, seven behind and if I shoot a good score tomorrow, I've got a chance. 

 Q.  How do you feel overall about your game? 
 LUKE DONALD:  It feels pretty good actually.  I had a bit of a rough patch a month ago or so.  I was struggling more mentally than anything. 
 But now everything feels like it's coming together.  You know, it's just I'm very close to shooting a really good score. 

 Q.  You almost expect the Europeans to be on the leaderboard nowadays. 
 LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, it's a good feeling.  It's good to see Henrik playing so well.  A lot of European guys are having good chances to win, so it bodes well for the majors hopefully.
