 Q. Sum up the day for us. 
 LUKE DONALD: It was disappointing. I wouldn't have minded losing if I played well, but I didn't really play well. I gave Ian too many opportunities and didn't take the opportunities when I had them unfortunately. You know, that will leave a sour taste in my mouth, but we'll move on to next week.

 Q. It's a funny old game, golf. This morning, and I watched you play, and this week I watched you play, and it's just been poetic. It's just been marvelous to watch. What was the difference today, mate?
 LUKE DONALD: I don't know, I just ran out of steam a little bit. Gave it my best shot. Unfortunately came up short. I didn't execute the shots when I needed to, and you know, that's disappointing.
