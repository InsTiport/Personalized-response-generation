 Q. Talk about your round today.  Amazing that you had that kind of round.  Looks like everybody came back with higher numbers, 7-under? 
 LUKE DONALD:  Yeah, I got off to a great start.  I think the key to my round was the 25-foot birdie on the first.  Anytime you start like that it gives you a boost. 
 And I made a good birdie on the second and I was off and running.  Hit a lot of good quality shots today.  Really didn't put myself in too much trouble, apart from 10, I missed the green left, had it almost dead.  But other than that I hit a lot of good shots today. 

 Q.  Conditions prime for a good round today? 
 LUKE DONALD:  A lot better, yeah.  The wind has obviously died down a little bit.  It's the same direction, so we're still used to the direction of this wind.  But less of it makes it a little easier out here.  Some of the pins were a little more accessible. 

 Q.  What about the rest of the day, as far as Phil and people in front of you right now? 
 LUKE DONALD:  I expect them to make some birdies.  If you're hitting good shots, a lot of fairways and greens, you can make some birdies today and I obviously proved that. 
 Hopefully they won't get too far away and I'll only be a few shots back come tomorrow.
