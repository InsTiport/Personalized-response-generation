And then put the ball in the hole.Q. Were you happy with the way you played today?MIN LEE: Yeah, not too bad.  I had a rough front nine.  And then I turn -- I make a turn, and it's tough on the back nine.  And I have 2-under on the back.  I'm pretty happy with that.Q. Did you notice a big difference with the green speeds today?  Some of the players were saying they were so much faster than they were yesterday.MIN LEE: Yeah, a little bit.  I think because the course dry out a little bit.  And it's a little harder to hold the second shot, like harder to spin the ball.  But overall it's pretty good.Q. How do you feel going into your last day tomorrow?MIN LEE: I don't know, I just want to do my best and then to see where I can go.
