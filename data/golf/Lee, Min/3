Q. Things got a little scrambled at the end yesterday, but everybody is pretty much on pace now.  Looks like your pace is pretty good?MIN LEE: Yeah, pace is really good.  We have a strong yesterday and then everybody -- I mean, finished pretty good.Q. Talk about your round.  Getting back into the flow, trying to get things started today and moving up the leaderboard.MIN LEE: Well, yeah, the first -- when I go down and the first few holes that I know -- I feel like my iron shots is pretty good today and I was trying to be aggressive to like attack the pin more to get more chance to get a birdie.  Then I make four birdies on the front. Then when I turn around, it feels -- because I think the back nine is a little longer, so I was a little upset that I make two bogeys.  But I will take that score.  That's really good for me.Q. What were the problems on your bogeys?MIN LEE: The bogeys are the bad drive or a second shot, putting it on the wrong side of the hole.Q. Which hole was that?MIN LEE: 11 and 14.  These two holes are tough.  Then I'm just trying to stay calm.  I have a good start, then I make bogey at the back.  I was kind of a little upset, but I was trying to stay calm too.Q. How do you get back to being calm when you put those bogeys up and you are trying to keep yourself somewhere in contention?MIN LEE: Well, I just take more deep breath and then just I start telling myself I still have a lot of holes today.  Not just today, I still have tomorrow and Sunday.Q. How do you make more progress?  How do you climb further up the leaderboard?  What do you have to do to get nearer to the top?MIN LEE: Well, I think just the same.  Just do what we plan to do and just play -- I mean, just play against yourself.  Just try to do your best.  I don't care about the score on the leaderboard because you can't control anybody else.  Just play my best
