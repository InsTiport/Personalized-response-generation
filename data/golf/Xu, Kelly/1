 Q.  How do you feel you played today?  
KELLY XU: I feel like today was pretty consistent.  Just trying to play conservative today.  When we found out we're playing with Erica we were like, Oh, yeah.  Just enjoy the day today.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
KELLY XU: So, yeah, it was a really great experience.  Going to learn from her because she's such a great player.   
It was a tough out there today, so...   
 Q.  What's your experience been like in match play?  
KELLY XU: This is actually my first match play ever.   
 Q.  Wow.  
KELLY XU: I learned about match play like last night by Googling it.  So I definitely like it more than stroke play, but it's great to have your first match play in the Girls' Junior.   
 Q.  Overall this week how have you liked the course?  
KELLY XU: The course is very subtly tough, so you can just have one little mistake and everything goes askew.  Once you're in match play it rules out the triple bogeys and stuff.  Definitely more relaxed playing match play here than stroke play.   
It was such a stressful day yesterday trying to make the cut because we were just one stroke in.  So we were scrambling all the way to 18 when we finally birdied, so we finally the made the cut.   
So it's definitely a difficult course, yeah.   
 Q.  So what's the mindset going into tomorrow?  
KELLY XU: Still the same thing.  When we found out we made the cut we were overjoyed.  We were overachieving already.  So I'm just going to keep playing relaxed and learn from some pretty great players.
