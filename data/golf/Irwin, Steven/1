 Q. This afternoon we had a little bit of rain, a little bit of wind. How did you do today?
 STEVEN IRWIN: Judging by the score, not very well. I got a little out of sorts there, kind of in the middle of it when the rain started, I lost my rhythm a little bit. I really did not strike the ball well today at all. And I was nervous, for sure. And then I think the rain and the wind kind of and probably the venue kind of exponentially made it harder for me.

 Q. What's the regrouping strategy for Friday?
 STEVEN IRWIN: Regrouping, I'm going to go home, sit down, kick my feet up and remind myself that I'm a 36-year-old amateur and try to go out tomorrow and have a good time and have some fun, and that's about it.
