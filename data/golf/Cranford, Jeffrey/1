Q.  Tell me a little bit about your round today.
JEFFREY CRANFORD:  It went south in two holes.  I missed 18 by a couple of feet and 1 by a couple of feet and made double bogeys.  I played the first eight even and the last seven even and then had double bogey, double bogey, bogey middle part of the round, so that was kind of disappointing.
Q.  Anything else out there that was a highlight of your round?
JEFFREY CRANFORD:  You know, I think everybody had good recovery shots and the rough is pretty intense.  I think day in and day out it's a little bit difficult.  I just don't see this kind of rough ever, and these guys play in it every week.  It's not an excuse, it's just part of the experience.  It's my first major championship round, so all said and done, it wasn't too bad other than those couple of holes.
Q.  With a round under your belt, do you feel like you have anything you're going to do    any knowledge for tomorrow you're going to carry over?
JEFFREY CRANFORD:  I knew it going in, but I hope fly will drive it better tomorrow and absolutely have to get it in the fairway.  You start missing fairways and it's over.  Just a couple feet will kill you.
Q.  Was there any part of your game that you struggled with today?
JEFFREY CRANFORD:  I drove it in the rough too many times to really make birdies and had some good saves, but it's pretty difficult, and I didn't putt particularly well.  I hit some good shots.
