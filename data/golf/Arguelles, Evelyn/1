Q. What was it like playing out there with Angel today?  You got down early but you fought back.EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, at the beginning -- she hits it pretty far, so seeing a girl that just like completely hits it far and straight, of course it's like intimidating a bit, and then at the beginning I felt like I was accelerated, I wasn't doing things right, my mind was in another place, and then you're supposed to enjoy this.  You've come all the way here and you've fought all the way here, so just enjoy it.  I enjoyed it, every second of it until the end.Q. Sounds like you've got a great attitude about this.EVELYN ARGUELLES: Thank you.Q. Tell me about here on 18.  Were you in the bunker over there?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yes, I was in the bunker.Q. And she had that crazy lie there?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yes, yes, it was a really good out from there for her, yeah, and that putt was really amazing.  I'm proud of Angel.Q. Tell me about when you started making your comeback out there on the course.  You got down your first two holes, and I think you were three or four down?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, I was three down, and the first birdie that I make, I hit a rescue and I hit it really close to the pin, and it was a birdie.  And then I kind of got my way into birdies, and then at the end, I had a really good putt, and then it like went inside and then it lipped out, and I'm like, what?  But I'm like -- I didn't feel like that much pressure because, you know how I told you I was enjoying myself?  I was just like, you know, just do what you do, and if you win, then it's good, it's great, and if you don't, then it's also great.Q. What do you take from this week?  I know this was your first USGA event.  Is this one of the biggest things you've ever played in?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, it's probably one of the biggest events for sure.  I'm taking that I really can do it, and I knew that, but like I've reassured it.Q. I saw you had Maria following you and a lot of friends.  I'm guessing that helped, too?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, yeah.  I really appreciate them being here and supporting me.Q. What are your plans for the rest of the summer?EVELYN ARGUELLES: So I'm playing America's Cup next week, and then I just got invited to PGA National, and after that I'm going to play the TransPacific in China in August.Q. And then you're off to college this fall or next fall?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Next fall.Q. So one year of high school left then?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, I still have time.Q. And you go to high school in Mexico?EVELYN ARGUELLES: Yeah, I go to Centro Educativo Cocoyoc.
