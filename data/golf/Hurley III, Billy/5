Q. Can you talk to me a little bit about the second round.
BILLY HURLEY: I just hit it in too many bunkers today, too many pitch-outs and everything like that.
Q. Short turnaround, do you think, affect anything?
BILLY HURLEY: No.  I thought the preparation of the golf course did.  That was -- it was tough because of how much the golf course changed between rounds.  So it was tough to make that adjustment.  That left us guessing a little bit, I think, out there this afternoon.
Q. Anything in particular you were really pleased with that you did out there?
BILLY HURLEY: Not really.
