Q.   Congratulations.   So, shooting par today in these conditions, how did you get that done? 
KRISTY McPHERSON:   Oh, it's definitely a U.S. Open kind of day out there today.   You know, pars are good scores.   The first two rounds I only had 9 pars, so lot of birdies, but a lot of bogeys, but we just focused on getting more birdies today (Indiscernible).   And sometimes you have to twoâ€‘putt (Indiscernible), and sometimes you can catch a ride and get it close.   Just a lot more solid and consistent day today.

Q.   What would you say overall in this competition that your best game has been? 
KRISTY McPHERSON:   Today definitely I didn't get in trouble off the tee, so you've got to keep it in play off the tee.   Like I said, you've got to hit the greens when you can.   And the key to a U.S. Open is a lot of times when you try to hit greens, you've got to miss it in the right spots.   After playing this course the last two days, you realize there are places you don't want to be. 
So we did a lot better with the game plan there today and really missing in the right spots and taking the birdie opportunities when they came.
