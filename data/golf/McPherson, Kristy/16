 Q. Was there anything to indicate this would be happening? 
 KRISTY McPHERSON: Yeah, I've been playing well lately, last three events finished Top-10, so I had some confidence coming in here. I played well today and stayed away from mistakes. I 3-putted the last hole and hate finishing that way but good start.

 Q. What was the highlight? 
 KRISTY McPHERSON: There wasn't anything fancy out there. I made a great putt on 7, which is probably one of the hardest holes out there and that got me a little bit of confidence. Just probably about 40 feet. So it's always nice to see those go in the hole. But yeah, there was nothing fancy, just birdied the holes I was supposed to and three out of the four par 5s. 
 You have to do that around here. They give you a chance to start off well with two reachable par 5s, and that gives you a little confidence after that. 

 Q. So what now? 
 KRISTY McPHERSON: I'll go out and practise a little bit and don't play until 3:17 tomorrow so I have plenty of time to rest and maybe see a little more of London.

 Q. What's been your best finish in the past? 
 KRISTY McPHERSON: I finished fourth a couple weeks ago.
