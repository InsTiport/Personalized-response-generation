 Q. Can you give a summary of the round and why you were making so many putts?
 KRISTY McPHERSON: The ball just wanted to go in the hole today, which is good. Last two days I've been struggling with my putting and my speed and did some speed drills yesterday and felt like I rolled the ball better. Got some long ones to go in, and have to be lucky to get that to happen. Stayed away from mistakes and had a lot of opportunities and a lot of them went in.

 Q. What happened with the eagle? 
 KRISTY McPHERSON: I hit 7-wood about 30 feet left and it was a big breaker, and just went in the hole. Obviously any time you can get two back in one hole, it gives you a little boost and birdied the next two from there. 
 So that gave me a little jump on it, and couldn't get any coming in, gave myself a lot of good opportunity, but you know, couldn't get any holes coming in, they are not easy holes and just couldn't get any there. But I had a good day overall.

 Q. What about the whole week?
 KRISTY McPHERSON: The whole week was up-and-down, kind of like this weather, you know. The first day was really good golf, and not too many mistakes, and same as today, and I'm the same person that played the last two days. 
 Got a little bit of the British Open style weather and the crowds here are unbelievable, but my first British Open, I loved it. It was great.
