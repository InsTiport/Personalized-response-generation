  Q. First of all, if you're anything like me, you're completely dripping. How did you handle the heat out here?   
 KRISTY McPHERSON: Yeah, definitely tough out there. Not much wind and just hot and sticky. I was just telling my caddie, We're not hitting any. We don't have much energy left.  
  
  Q. What do you do throughout a round like this to keep yourself hydrated? Do you eat and chug the water?  
 KRISTY McPHERSON: Both. Yep, all of the above. Had some Gatorade. It's tough out there. You have to pay attention to make sure you get enough fluids in you. You have to pay attention to every shot, because you have to work up the energy. Especially coming down late, when it gets really hot. You have to work up the energy to put a good swing on it.  
  
  Q. What was the course like overall out there?  
 KRISTY McPHERSON: It's tough. I don't think you'll find anybody that says it plays easy or was scorable. It's 18 good holes. You have to pay attention. You can't lose focus for one minute or it will come back and get you.  
  
  Q. You're right in the middle of the things, only two shots back. Right now what do you do tonight to recuperate and get ready for tomorrow?  
 KRISTY McPHERSON: Just do a lot of rest. I mean, it's gonna be a hot one tomorrow afternoon. I think chance of thunderstorms. May be a long day.   
 But I like the game plan we have for the golf course. I like the way I'm hitting it. I made some putts today. So just rest and relax and wait until it's my turn again.
