  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 KRISTY McPHERSON: Not very good. Never got anything going. Didn't make any bogeys, but that doesn't help a lot if you can't make any birdies.   
 Ran into a buzz saw with Anna out there. She got on a nice little run and G.A. and I couldn't put any pressure on her.  
  
  Q. Did you feel the pressure coming down the line? Were you watching the scoreboard at all?  
 KRISTY McPHERSON: No. I mean, I didn't feel any pressure. I was three shots back, so there wasn't any pressure. I mean, you have nowhere to go but up from there.   
 Nobody is playing for second out here. I knew that I had a lot of work to do, and unfortunately couldn't make any birdies.  
  
  Q. How were the course conditions today?  
 KRISTY McPHERSON: They were about as good as you could hope for with two days off in the middle of the week. But, yeah, greens are nice. Fairway's playing lift, clean, and place, and dried out a good bit from yesterday. So it was nice.
