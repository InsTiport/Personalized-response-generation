 Q. So 7-under today. Is that right?
 CHAD COLLINS: Yeah. Well, yesterday and today.

 Q. Let's talk about that. I mean 7-under over two days. Maybe some high points of the round?
 CHAD COLLINS: Just played solid. High point would be no bogeys. Had an eagle last night on hole No. 2 right before it got dark. Just played solid. 
 Been putting well, chipping well. Driving is pretty decent for me. I'd like to be driving a little bit better, but all in all, just been solid the last two days.

 Q. How's the course holding up?
 CHAD COLLINS: Pretty wet. Yeah, pretty wet. If you don't hit the fairway, you know, you're going to get mud on your ball, and the rough seems like -- it makes it hard to get your iron -- shots close to the green, close to the pin. 
 If you're in the fairway, obviously you can put your hands on it, makes it a lot easier, so puts a premium on it to get it in the fairways. Pretty wet for the most part.

 Q. What's the plan between now? Looks like tee time's going to be 2, 3:00 or so. What's the plan?
 CHAD COLLINS: Yeah. He said I should be around 5:00, didn't he? I'm going to go back and take a nap. This morning was early. Get back in the AC.
