  Q. First time at THE PLAYERS. Just get your comments on being here, first off.   
 CHAD COLLINS: It's an honor being here, you know. The best players in the world are here. Had a great year so far, being able to get in, it's great. I'm looking forward to it.   
 It's going to be a great week, a great opportunity, the first of the year. It's been a great year so far.   
  
  Q. One of those tournaments everybody loves to watch because of those last few holes. Talk about those three holes and have you played this course before?   
 CHAD COLLINS: Yeah, I have played it. Actually stayed here with a buddy of mine, Dan Olsen, who lives down here and Frank Lickliter about four or five years ago. I stayed with him and played and practiced here. So I played a couple of times.   
 It's been four or five years. So it's a little bit different with all the stands and everything. Makes it look a little different. But it's three tough holes. 16 being a par 5 and 17, you know, it's an intimidating hole, especially if you've got wind. Even if you don't, it's just a lot of pressure there. Some small targets surrounded by water.   
 But it's going to be fun. I'm looking forward to it. Kind of reminds me of 16 at Phoenix a little bit. The stadium-type situation. Then 18, 18 I think is the hardest of the three hole, so, yeah.
