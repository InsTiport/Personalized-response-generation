 Q.   Seven birdies out there, 6 under par 66, and a good position.  
CHAD COLLINS:   Yeah, it was a good day.   Made a few putts.   I got the ball fairly close to the hole.   Made a few long ones.   Yesterday I made a few 10 to 12-footers for par to kind of keep the round going.   It was a good day.   I played a lot more solid today and just got in a good position.   
   
 Q.   Was the golf course much different out there today than it was yesterday?  
CHAD COLLINS:   There wasn't much wind this morning, obviously.   The greens are great, period.   But they were a little smoother this morning being, you know, three, four groups out but, for the most part, played about the same.   
The greens are a little more receptive than they were on like Monday and Tuesday.   They're a lot firmer then, little softer.   Get the ball a little closer to the hole.   The greens are tough.   Got a lot of slopes.   Hard to get the ball close to the hole.   Got to make a lot of 10, 15, 20 footers to make birdies.  
   
 Q.   Almost halfway through the season you have one Top-10.   Feeling pressure to start playing a little better?  
CHAD COLLINS:   I do.   I got off to a good start, which is nice.   I don't usually get off to a good start.   Summertime I kind of kick it in gear and start playing a little bit better.   Hopefully this will be the start to it.  
   
 Q.   Any spots up there on the golf course today that were tough?  
CHAD COLLINS:   Trying to think.   No, nothing I can really think of.   You don't want to short side yourself too much out there.   Looks like it's going to get a little windier.   Hit a lot of greens and, you know, pars are good out there.  
   
 Q.   Well played today.   Good luck this weekend.  
CHAD COLLINS:   Thank you.
