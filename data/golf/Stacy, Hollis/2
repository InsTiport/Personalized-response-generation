Q. Can you just talk about your overall emotions about this week, feelings?
HOLLIS STACY: It was just great to be a part of the first, and the USGA did a great job of having it at such a great golf course.
You know, it's just been very memorable.
Q. Awesome.  We were just talking about Martha being exempt next year.
HOLLIS STACY: Yeah.
Q. Have you had a chance to think about next year at Pine Needles?
HOLLIS STACY: Oh, yeah, well I know what I have to do to prepare for next year.
Q. Perfect.  And what do you think about the course and it being at Pine Needles?
HOLLIS STACY: Oh, this is really tough, really tough.  I've never putted -- well, I have putted more severe greens, but since we don't play a lot of competitions I wasn't quite ready for this.
It was a great track.  I finished like middle of -- like 25th, so not bad, not bad.
Q. And so next year it's at Pine Needles.  Have you ever played out there?
HOLLIS STACY: Many times.  Peggy Kirk Bell and Bullet were good friends of mine, so I'm friends with the children, Bonnie, Peggy, and Kirk.
So I support them 100%, 1000%, and I know it's going to be a great championship.
