Q. How did you play today?
HOLLIS STACY: I thought I hit the ball very well.  The greens are just so treacherous.  I missed probably about four short putts I would have loved to have taken back, but these greens are pretty tough.
Q. What were you and JoAnne working on?
HOLLIS STACY: Oh, I've played with her the last two tournaments, and she just putted so solid, the short putts, so I'm going to go work on that right now.  She's just putted so solid.  I'm going to go try that.  You know, she's pretty incredible.
Q. Shooting her age yesterday, how special was that?
HOLLIS STACY: Oh, it was just awesome.  I told her she had to birdie the last hole.  We were walking down the middle, and she didn't realize -- she thought she had to eagle.  I was like, no, birdie.
Q. So you're going to make the cut.  How special is that to do this week?
HOLLIS STACY: Oh, it's wonderful.  My goal is top 10, top 15.  Yeah, I think I jumped up a few.  I was 28th, so probably jumped up a few spots today, probably 20th today.  I like it.  I feel really good.
