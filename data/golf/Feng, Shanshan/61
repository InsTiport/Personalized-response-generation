Q. Have you decided to give the rest of the field a chance this year?
SHANSHAN FENG: That's not the case.  I mean, when I was on the course, I actually gave my 100 per cent today.  My ball-striking was actually very good.  I had so many birdie chances.  But my putting wasn't really working.  I was missing all the short birdie putts and also the par putts, also.  So that's why I didn't make too many birdies but a few bogeys.  I think even par is not a great score, but I still feel like at least I tried my best.
Q. Lots of people have struggled with the putter today.  Are the greens running tricky?  Are the pins hard?  What is it?
SHANSHAN FENG: I think the first half it was because of myself.  I think maybe my posture was a little bit off, and then I think my putting was getting better towards the end.  But I didn't have too many holes left when I started to feel like I could putt.  Yeah, that was it.
Q. I have to ask you about the second shot on 17.  It was unusual.
SHANSHAN FENG: I know.  Actually my ball was still on the fairway, but I didn't have a stance because the lip of the bunker was really steep.  I couldn't even stand in the bunker and hit.  So I had to go left-handed, but then I had to call the rules official to ask if I could use the back of my club to actually hit the ball, and I've never done that, so before I hit it, I didn't even know where the ball was going, but I just gave it a swing, and actually it went like 70 yards.  My caddie said, oh, you surprised me, you actually can hit it 70 yards.  I was really happy I saved a par there.
Q. Will you try it again in the future?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, if I have to.  But if I don't have to, maybe I won't.
