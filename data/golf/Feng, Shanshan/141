Q.   So strong finish.   How are you feeling?
SHANSHAN FENG:   It feels amazing.   You know, the last hole I made an eagle out of the bunker, and I think that's my second eagle of the year.   I think that's a good way to finish. 
The first day on the last hole I made a bogey, and then after the round I said to the media, I'm going to make it back on the same hole, and that's what I did.   So I'm very happy. 

Q.   A potential playoff in the making. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think I have been in three playoffs so far in my career, and I'm 1‑2. 
So of course I hope that I can be in the playoff if they give me a chance. 

Q.   Was that one of the best shots you've ever played?
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yes.   It wasn't a very tough bunker shot.   It was a flat lie and I had room to let the ball roll.   I mean, under pressure I would think that's a very good shot. 

Q.   Did you know what you had to do? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I never thought about it because my goal was already set.   I hoped for top 10. 
This morning I was thinking in my head, Stacey shot 63.   I was like, That's a good round.   I thought maybe my best round of the this year was 5‑under.   I asked me caddie, Do you think it's 5‑under?   He said, Yes.   I said, Not 5?   He said, Not yet. 
Then actually today I shot 6‑under, so it's my best round of the year.
