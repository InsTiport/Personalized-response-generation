 Q.  A nice second round 65 for you, still at the top of the leaderboard.  You've got to feel good, one of your usual great rounds here in Malaysia.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, I think overall today was a very good round.  I didn't have as many birdie chances as yesterday but I think I actually made more putts.  So that actually made me happy, and I think 6-under is still a very good score here.   
And I really enjoyed playing with my teammates, Suzann and Madelene, and I think I'm playing with Madelene tomorrow, too, so I think we are going to enjoy.   
 Q.  What's the game plan going into the weekend?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think what we did for the first two rounds were good.  So I think I'm going to try to stick to the same plan and do the same things.   
 Q.  The long four-hour rain delay in the middle, how difficult is it for you to keep focused while you're sitting there not playing golf?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I was really relaxed.  I had my feet up, and then I was actually taking a nap.  Some caddies were taking a picture of me, showing the others, like, oh, she's sleeping again.   
Yeah, I mean, that's what I always do, because I know that when we're having long delays, it's kind of stressful and you just have to find a way to relax and forget about it.
