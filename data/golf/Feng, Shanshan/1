  Q. Top three at a major.  Not bad at all.  How are you feeling after the final day?
 SHANSHAN FENG:   Feeling very good.  I mean, I still missed like some of the putts, but I was watching the groups in front and behind, and looks like the greens are just kind of tough.
 I mean, so finally I actually got a couple birdies out from the rough, from the fairway, so I was very happy about that.
 So I think maybe I learn some new skills.
 Q. Overall what has this week been like for you to come back to the tour and being able to secure a top finish at a major championship like this?
 SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, it's been amazing.  Like I said, I really didn't think I was going to make the cut.  My goal was just to shoot one round in red number and just enjoy the whole time on the course.  I think I've enjoyed the whole four days.  Doesn't matter if I was playing well or not.  I was really enjoying the whole time.
 So I think I did very well.
 Q. And when is the next time we'll see you and what will you be doing getting ready for the next event?
 SHANSHAN FENG:   I'm not going to play Hawaii so you'll see me at L.A.
 Q. L.A.  What are you going to do in between then?
 SHANSHAN FENG:   Maybe lots of rest.  My boss actually went down today.  Well, I thought I was going to be the one that you need to worry about.
 Q. What happened?
 SHANSHAN FENG:   He just had an upset stomach.  Yeah, hasn't been eating.  Yeah, everything is coming out so he's losing all his energy.  But I'm happy that we actually have two weeks in front of the next tournament.  I'm pretty sure both of us will get well recovered before then.
