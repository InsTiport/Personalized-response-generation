Q.   Talk about your round today. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think today the conditions were a little tougher because we had more wind and the wind was kind of gusty and my iron shots were a little better than yesterday.   Didn't do as well on the par‑5s today, only made two birdies.   But I think even par is not a bad score.   4‑under for two days, I think I'm still in good shape.

Q.   How tough are those last four holes, 15 to 18? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   15 to 18?   I think‑‑ oh, the front nine.   Oh, I think I made two bogeys the last four holes.   I don't really remember.   Were they par‑4s? 

Q.   Yeah, par‑4s?
SHANSHAN FENG:   Oh, the par‑4s, right.   I think the par‑4s, you have to hit your driver very well, and then second shots are kind of tough, especially the last hole.   I mean, the 18th hole, the green is so difficult.   I was lucky because both of the days I hit my ball really close to the hole and it was a direct shot.   So I took them both of the days, but I've seen people going around and around.

Q.   If this wind dies down, I know you're not one to look at the leaderboard, but are you still in striking zone? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I didn't set any goals coming in this week, so I don't care where I'm at right now.   I think I tried my best going forward the first two days and I'm just going to keep doing the same thing over the weekend.
