 Q.  Shanshan, can you open with some comments about coming back here in Japan?  
 Shanshan Feng: Actually I was in Japan a couple of months ago I played at LPGA Championship Konica Minolta Cup. So this time is only two months away, every time I come back to Japan, I'm really excited, very happy because I love the people in Japan, and I love Japanese food, and Japanese courses. TOTO has done a very great job providing this tournament. I think we are very appreciated and also I think every time if I have a chance to come back, I would like to enjoy the week.   
 Q.  You played 18 holes today, just give me your impression on the Seta Golf Course.  
 Shanshan Feng: Well, it was my second time to play Seta Golf Course, I think its a very good design golf course, traditional Japanese-style, type of grasses and design. And I would say that it's a golf course for a lot of birdies if I strike the ball well.   
 Q.  So what is your goal for this week?  
 Shanshan Feng: Well, I didnt set any goals in coming this week, I know that I have some success on this tournament, I just want to enjoy the week and this is the end of season of this year, so I think Ill try my best.
