SHANSHAN FENG: (In progress.)...had a really good day today. Very good day today.   
 Q.  How was your day today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: It was so so. But, I mean, front nine was pretty good. On the back, just like yesterday, that I for somehow think I'm not eating enough or I don't know, I just feel like I'm not swinging very well on the back.   
And then trying to save pars and missed birdies, it's like that. But little frustrated, but I'm still trying to stay patient, yeah.   
I mean, it wasn't that bad. I still shot a red number.   
 Q.  Exactly. You've still got to be proud of the way you're playing in front of the fans out there.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I'm happy to see them. In the weekend I'm expecting more fans to come. Very happy to come back. This is my first time to come back this year to play, so I'm very looking forward to seeing all the fans in Shanghai.   
 Q.  You said a couple little things are just not quite right on the back nine. Anything in particular you want to go work on?  
SHANSHAN FENG: My ball-striking is not the best recently, especially this week. It just happened. I don't know why. But, you know, I'm trying to -- hopefully I can figure it out.   
I'm going to practice a little bit, yeah.   
 Q.  And you talked the other day about you're here for a week. You have however many meals to get your favorite Chinese food in. What is your favorite Chinese meal? If you could recommend me one thing to eat?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Here or anything from China?   
 Q.  Maybe both.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Where I'm from, dim sum is the food. So dim sum, including (indiscernible), including like a lot of different dishes.   
So I think dim sum.   
 Q.  Okay. And what is your favorite local Shanghai food?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I like the, how do you call that, like sweet and sour ribs.   
 Q.  Ribs?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah. It's really good.
