Q.   How was the day?   Everything all right with your game?
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I think I started the game like really solid.   I made two birdies on the first two holes, and then actually I hit two kind of like poor drives, so I made two bogeys afterwards, but I stayed patient and made four more birdies on the back, and I'm really happy about that 4‑under score. 

Q.   Talk about your goal for this season. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, my goal actually this year was to win three times, actually, and now it's zero so far, and I have five left, so I'm trying hard.   Like last week, I was defending champion, and we were playing in China.   I think I was just‑‑ it was just not my week.   I totally lost myself out there last week, so I'm really happy that I'm actually shooting in the 60s again today, so I'm feeling good. 

Q.   It's quite hazy out there.   Did you find it more difficult to play in the haze? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I don't think so.   It doesn't really do anything except for you can't see really far.   But it's the same.   I think it's actually pretty good because we have less sun and it's less humid, so I liked it.

Q.   Coming off last week, did you feel a lot of pressure being at home defending?   Do you feel more at ease this week now? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yes, I think so.   I'm more relaxed this week.   Last week, I mean, I think people wanted me to win again, and I told everybody I was not going to give myself pressure, but I think I still did a little bit.   I tried too hard and actually it went the wrong way.   But I think I really enjoy it here in Malaysia every year.   Last year I did really well, and here I can still speak Chinese to everybody, so it's almost like home again.
