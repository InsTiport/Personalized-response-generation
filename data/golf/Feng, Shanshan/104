 Q.   You were 21st in Australia, 10th in Thailand and another Top‑10 finish here in Singapore.   Are you happy with the way your season has started?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I would say the first tournament, Australia, the course was really tough.   I would say wasn't that bad I would say, and last week I made my first Top‑10 this week, and I believe I made a Top‑5 here this week.   
I feel very confident, and I think I'm really looking forward for the year.   
   
 Q.   Talk to us about this Australasian swing, it started a few weeks ago in Australia, and it was hot there, hot in Thailand, hot in Singapore.   Did you find it a hard slog coming out here?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I would say, we know it's all hot here, and last week, also in, Thailand, so we were prepared.   
Also, Australia, we were kind of lucky because we got a lot of cloud covers, and this week, it's not that bad.   I think‑‑ you know what the players say, they say I play better in the hot weather.   So I don't mind the hot weather.   
   
 Q.   But you're heading off to a very cold place now.   Tell us about it.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, next week I'm going to be playing in Japan, and hopefully it's not that cold.   It might be a little cold there but I'll be fine.   
   
 Q.   You played very consistent golf.   Your results are phenomenal.   What would your big goals for 2015 be?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Just to win tournaments; because I set a goal to win one time three years ago I think; and then two years ago, I said, okay, I want to win twice; and then I did it again.   
So last year I said, okay, I want to win three times, but then I was kind of pushing myself a little bit.   It gave me a little bit of pressure maybe, and my dad said to me, he said, you had just won three years in a row on the LPGA, which is very good already, so just set a goal to win, that's it.
