 Q.  Tremendous start.  7-under par today.  What was working well for you out there?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think after I captured the victory at the Volvik Championship I think my condition is pretty good.  Everything is not bad.  I mean, my ball striking is as good as usual and my putting is working also.   
I was very happy that I made -- I think I made six birdies and an eagle today, rolled it from outside of the green.   
So I'm really happy about what I did today.   
 Q.  It was a little bit windy out there this afternoon.  Did you have to adjust your approach to today's round at all with the conditions?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I would say there wasn't too much wind, and I say the greens are a lot firmer though.  Yesterday when we played the pro-am the balls were kind of stopping on the greens, but today they weren't stopping at all.   
Played a little bit different.  Yeah, but I still did well.   
 Q.  You'll tee off earlier tomorrow.  Are you going to adjust anything tonight before you play early tomorrow versus this afternoon today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: No, I think overall I did pretty well today, so just same game plan, and three more days.   
 Q.  The pants, the cow pants are tremendous.  What's the inspiration behind those?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I don't know.  Maybe because when wear the cow pants more people recognize me.  They're like, Oh, that's her right there.   
Maybe I make people more excited, and because they're excited so I'm more excited so I want to play better.  Maybe that helps.
