 Q.  Well, a bogey-free round was between and you dinner.  It's got to be a good feeling to go bogey-free today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah.  I mean, I think today I did pretty well on the par-5s.  I had 3-under on the par-5s and just pars on the rest.   
I mean, I know in the windy situation I shouldn't be asking for too much.  I'm still happy about the round today.   
 Q.  Certainly.  You're in second going into the weekend.  How do you feel your game is setting up for the weekend?  The winds, we hear, might pick up a little bit over the weekend.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, that's what I really want.  I saw the wind dying down and I was like, No, keep blowing.  Yeah, so that's going to be exciting, exciting weekend for me, because I like the wind, like I always say.   
So I'm very looking forward for it.   
 Q.  Just trying to stay steady today, be patient?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, that's the key when you're playing in the wind.  Anything can happen.  You can hit a good shot and it might go anywhere.   
I would say I did pretty well today.  I mean, all the ones that I didn't hit on the greens I got up and down.  Especially on 18 today.  I hit a super bunker shot there.   
Yeah, I mean, it was good.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you about that up and down.  Tough spot to be in back of this green when the pin is all the way in the front.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, the good thing was because the wind was actually -- it was down from the second shot and I hit from the rough, so, I mean, I couldn't really leave it short because there was water short of it.  I had to hit it.   
And then it just went a little longer than I thought and went in the bunker.  Then the third shot was actually into the wind, so it helped the ball to stop a little bit.   
I actually practiced from the same spot, from the bunker to the front pins in the practice rounds because I knew that those might happen and those are the tougher ones.   
So I did practice, so I kind of had the feelings about its distances and how to get the ball there.  I think the practice was worth it.   
 Q.  Yesterday you mentioned changing your putter.  Who was telling you that you were having some issues, they thought you were having issues with your putter?  
SHANSHAN FENG: A lot of people.   
 Q.  Really?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Like coaches?  Family members?  Friends?  Fans?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, like, you know, like friends and people.  Yeah.   
 Q.  So that wasn't something you were noticing with your putter?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I kind of knew it but I didn't mind because I was putting well.  Yeah, but then they were like, Trust me.  If we adjust it you can putt even better.  I tried and then couldn't putt.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Matter of trusting yourself?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah.  Well, I mean, the thing is we're not trying to -- how to say?  Like I know that I don't aim straight and I don't actually make a good, very good stroke.  But I can control the ball to where I want it to start on.  I mean, if it can start on the line then I can putt.   
So I think because I'm so used to, so and then I made a change.  Maybe it was a good change actually, but I just couldn't fit myself into it.   
 Q.  Great.  Didn't work for you.
