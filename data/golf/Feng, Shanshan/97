 Q.  Pretty good run there, but just Jess played too well?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think, you know, I wasn't really looking at the leaderboard, but I kind of knew that somebody was way ahead because like usually if you're leading like crowds will be a little different.   
They'll be like, Shanshan, go for the win.  Nobody said that, so I was like, somebody must be playing really well.  My goal today was to get to 15-under and I got to 14.  It was a bogey-free round.  I think I played very well.   
 Q.  Why do you dominate this golf course so much?  Second, first, second.  
SHANSHAN FENG: I think like maybe you said, it suits my game.  Actually this week I did make some mistakes.  For example, like 18 I had bogey and double to start with.   
But I still think overall this golf course I can make a lot of birdies, so it's good.
