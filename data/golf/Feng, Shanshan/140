 Q.   How did that compare to the first two days?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think I was kind of a little nervous maybe at the beginning, so I wasn't really making a lot of putts.   I did make two easy bogeys, and then after that, I think maybe the players in my group, they gave me a lot of pressure because they were keep making putts and putting it really close to the pins.   
Then I think I handled that pressure really well.   I had quite a come back.   I had three birdies in a row for the last three holes, so I think I'm back in position, and still confident.   
   
 Q.   At one point your lead was down to two strokes; were you aware of that, did you look at the leaderboards?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Not really.   I have a habit that I don't look at leaderboards during the tournament.   
   
 Q.   But you must be very pleased with that finish, as you say, great to finish strongly, particularly on round three going into the last day?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I think I did pretty good.  
   
 Q.   And what's the game plan tomorrow?   Do you address the last day differently when you're in the lead?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   No, I don't.   You mean dress like outfit?   
   
 Q.   No, in terms of how you approach the round.   You have a healthy lead.   Do you play conservatively or do you go out attacking?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think I've done pretty well for three days and I think I'm going to stick on my same game plan.   Like I said earlier, my goal is just Topâ€‘5, so it's no pressure.
