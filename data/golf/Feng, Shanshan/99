 Q.  Disappointing bogey at the last, but pretty good round, you think?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I think overall I did really well.  I mean, the last hole there the ball just bounced.  It hit something and bounced off.   
But overall I think I did pretty well today.  5-under.  I'm really happy that I didn't have too much pressure during the round.  I still brought out my A Game.   
Still three more days to go.   
 Q.  How annoying was the three-hour rain delay there?  You were rolling, and all of a sudden they had to pull you back in.  
SHANSHAN FENG: It's fair to everybody because we have similar tee times, even though some people finish before.  But I think it's fair, because sometimes we get the delay and the others maybe get it next time.   
So I think it was fine for me.  It was good time for lunch.   
 Q.  What about your bogeys and birdies today?  Where did you make them?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Bogey the last hole, and birdies, I had 2, 3, 4.   
 Q.  What were those like?  Short putts?  
SHANSHAN FENG: They were not that short.  I think they were around 15 feet.   
 Q.  Okay.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, all three of them.   
Then I think 6, it was short.   
And then the par-5, that one was like maybe ten feet.  Then another one on 14.  That one was maybe ten feet.   
 Q.  Okay.  What was working for you out there?  What was working in your game?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I think I everything was pretty good.  I mean, I was hitting the fairways and greens and I made some putts.   
Yeah.   
 Q.  What was it like to be announced as the defending champion here on the first tee?  
SHANSHAN FENG: What's it mean?   
 Q.  What was it like to play as the defending champion last year?  
SHANSHAN FENG: They didn't even mention it.   
 Q.  Didn't mention it?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Nope.  They just said from China, Shanshan Feng.   
 Q.  Someone messed up?  
SHANSHAN FENG: No, it's like a regular tournament.   
 Q.  Okay.  Perfect.  What do you think it takes out here to win?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I think just need to maybe find the fairways first, and then from the fairways, because we're playing the balls up, so it's easy to knock it close to the pins.   
Then it's just a putting contest.
