 Q.   Last week?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I'm not sure, but I think yesterday was like 30 years in tournament maybe.   It's just getting more and more people to play.   
   
 Q.   When did you start playing?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   When I was 10.  
   
 Q.   Did you go through one of the ‑‑ did they pick you out as somebody with a lot of talent like they do at their sports schools or did you just take it up yourself?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   My dad actually was working for a golf association in my hometown, so we have like a junior team in our hometown.   And I just wanted to try, and then I was on the team and that's it.  
   
 Q.   I assume you're not a natural blonde?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Huh?   
   
 Q.   You have blonde.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah.   I'm usually blonde.  
   
 Q.   Do you do it for fun or just to fit in more?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   My hairdresser said that this color would make me look whiter.   I was like, okay.   I'll do it.  
   
 Q.   Apparently you've really become accustomed to life on the U. S. tour.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I don't know, but I can tell that after I won a major there were a lot more people that recognize me now.  
   
 Q.   What about as far as what kind of recognition do you get in China?   Most people there still probably don't know much about golf?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I would say if they don't play golf, maybe they still don't really know about me.   
But you know, we're trying to get there, I think, because after I won, I haven't been back to China.   I'm going back after tomorrow, and we are going to have a lot of different press conference and different parties.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure you'll be much more famous.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Hopefully.  
   
 Q.   Well, congratulations again on a nice round.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   What was the difference with today's round?   How were the conditions?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I would say it's actually more windy, but I mean the temperature is nice.   So there's no heat.   And I think I could concentrate a little better without the heat.   
And I would say that the greens in the morning they are not as bumpy, so it was ‑‑ I made a little more putts than yesterday, which I played late afternoon and couldn't make any putts.   
Yeah, I think that's the only difference.  
   
 Q.   Are you satisfied with your round today?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I would say so.   I had two bogeys and three birdies.   I think the first round ‑‑ both of the first and second round I only had one birdie, I think.   So I'm feeling good.  
   
 Q.   Is it a big difference with that wind the way it kicks in, because you guys didn't have much wind the last couple days.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I would say the course will play a little differently, because today they have a lot of different tees, like either long or like some tees that I didn't even think they would use.   And it's playing a little different.   But I think the wind is dying now, so it should be fine, no problem.
