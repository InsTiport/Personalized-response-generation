Q. What's been working so well for you these past couple days and today?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I would say my ball striking is always my strength, and I think I hit maybe -- I think yesterday I only missed one green, and today I think I hit every green.
So I think the longest putt today was maybe I would say like maybe 20 feet, so I had a lot of birdie chances.
The only difference was yesterday my putting wasn't as good.  I was lucky enough to hit it in on 16 to make an eagle.  Today my putting was a lot better.  I made quite a few short putts for birdies and also a couple longer putts for birdies, too.
Yeah.
Q. What has it been like playing in front of the fans in China?
SHANSHAN FENG: Of course, I mean, I'm in China; I'm in Beijing, the heart, the capital of China.  Three years ago, two years ago when we were here we had maybe like over 10,000 of people coming on the weekend.
I know that there will be a lot of the Chinese fans coming this time also.  I'm really excited to see them.  Normally when I'm overseas I actually don't get too many spectators, fans coming to watch me, cheering me, so it's special.  I really like it.
Every time I get the shot I make them so excited.  It pushes me to like maybe try to make birdies on every hole because I want to see them happy, to be excited.
So that always helps my performance, I think.
