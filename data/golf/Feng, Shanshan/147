 Q.   Just take us through your round today.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I started the round with a bogey.   I was never on the fairway.   I was in the bunker.   First shot in the bunker again.   Second shot, chipping and 2‑putted.   It wasn't a very good start, but I made a birdie on 3rd or 4th.   After that birdie I knew I was back.  
Then I was patient again, and I made two more‑‑ made one more bogey and one more birdie after I made the turn.   I missed a shot putt on the par‑3 which I made a bogey.   Then I stayed very patient until the last hole I made the‑‑ like a 20‑feet putt, maybe.   I made it for birdie.   So I'm happy.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions today versus the first three rounds and kind of where they are ranked in terms of difficulty.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think today‑‑ I mean, the conditions is nice.   The weather is so nice and it's not as windy.   I think today is only like a mental game.   So if you can handle the pressure, that depends on if you can handle the pressure or not.   
   
 Q.   Talk about having won the last major, coming into this week.   How does that prepare you just for the championship overall?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   You know, that wind was a little surprised‑‑ a little surprising.   But I think I‑‑ I really gained a lot of confidence after that one.   But I know that the U.S. Open, it's like I would say it's the major of major.   It's like the top one, No. 1 tournament that everybody wants to win.   
So I was saying actually‑‑ I taught myself not to have pressure, but I still have pressure going to play.   I think I handled it very well today.   Yeah, I think I did okay.   
   
 Q.   Talk about having that experience of being in contention the last major and playing in a final round and going out and shooting a good score through a final round, I know how I want to play?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah.   The first two days I was nervous, like I said.   I was‑‑ I barely made the cut.   I was 1 better than the cut.   But I know that the score‑‑ on this course it's like par is not bad.   So everybody is going to make over pars in the weekend.   And if you can stay even or like 1 or 2‑under, which I did, than I'm going to move up.   I was very patient.   I was trying to just play par.   
   
 Q.   So 1‑under par was a pretty good round for you today?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yes, I think so.   
   
 Q.   Thank you.
