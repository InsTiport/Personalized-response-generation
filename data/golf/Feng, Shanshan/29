Q. Very first round as world No. 1.  You've been dreaming of this.  How was it?
SHANSHAN FENG: On the first tee I was a little bit nervous because it was like the first shot after I became world No. 1.  I didn't want to hit it in the trees.  I was like, hopefully I can find a fairway.  I hit it good shot, so I started the round with a birdie.  I was happy about that.
Then afterwards, I started to get more comfortable.  I mean, I played okay today.  Just miss-read some of the putts.  The greens here are hard to read sometimes.
Q. Given everything that's at stake and the No. 1 ranking that obviously everybody is talking about, now that you have the first round out of the way, so you think you can attack the golf course a little bit more?  Maybe a little less pressure tomorrow?
SHANSHAN FENG: Oh, yeah, I think so, because tomorrow I wouldn't be in the last group.  I will be in one of the earliest groups and we can play fast.  I've won here few years ago so I know the course.
I think tomorrow just stick to my game plan and hopefully bring a low round.
Q. Given your last four performances and the fact that you like this golf course, how high is your confidence level out there?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think every week I'm ready.  You know, that's what my coach told me.  You have to prepare like you are going to win the tournament.  That's what I always do before the tournament.  Then, I mean, my preparation is good enough to win the tournament.  I think everything depends on how you really play on the course.
But I think I just want to enjoy the process, shot by shot, and then hopefully some good result will come up.
