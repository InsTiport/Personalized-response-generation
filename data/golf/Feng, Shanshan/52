 Q.  17 pars, one birdie.  How do you feel about the round today?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I would say my ball striking was still pretty good.  I hit most of the fairways, except for the last one.  And then, I mean, I had some birdie chances out there I just couldn't make the putts.   
Then finally on the 18, I guess I hit it close enough.  I finally made a birdie to make the fans a little bit excited.  I'm still happy about the score.   
 Q.  You have been in good positions before.  You have the experience.  How much of a help will that be not to look past tomorrow's round to look at the trophy?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think I have been doing well this week.  And coming to this week, I didn't have any expectation at all.  I just -- I wanted to bring out my A game.  And then I think I did really well for the first three days, and then I'm going to stick to my game plan tomorrow.  I just focus on my own game and let's see what happens.
