Q. 2-1-2-1-2:  That's quite a run you've had here.  How do you feel?
SHANSHAN FENG: Of course I'm feeling good.  Even though I did start the round roughly, I was 2-over through 13 holes.  I would say I had some bad lucks out there.  I couldn't make any putts on the front and then got plugged lies in the bunker and stuff.
I think I tried.  I tried my best.  On the last three holes, I made two birdies, and on the last hole, Cristie held that putt.  You know, I was just trying to make that putt but, well, I mean, I didn't make it.  But I think second is still not a bad finish here, and I'm still keeping my record pretty good here in Malaysia.  So it goes 2-1-2-1-2; I'll come back next year and see if I can keep it up.
Q. Were there any naps during the break this time?
SHANSHAN FENG: No.  I mean, it was short.  It was only less than an hour for us, so it was a lunch break.  So right after I ate, everything was done.
