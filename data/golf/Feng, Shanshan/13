 Q.  Did you feel like today you were ready?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Oh, yeah.  I mean, before the round today I didn't know what the others were going to do, so I was aiming for 30-under.  That was my goal at the beginning of the week.   
After three days I still had a chance to get it there until the last hole.  I mean, I thought I had it when I was walking up the green on the last hole because I saw so many people here.   
And then before I putt I looked up at the leaderboard and I'm like, Oh, no.  I had to make that one.  So actually the last putt was under a lot of pressure.  I was like, You know what?  You've been doing really well this week.  Just make another good putt.  That's what I did.   
 Q.  Talk about your ball striking today.  Iron shots to a foot, two feet, three feet here on the final hole.  Is that about as good as you have hit it in your career?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I would say that my ball striking is always my strength.  But actually starting from last year kind of lost it a little bit.  I tried to get more distance off the tees and then actually maybe just messed up the feeling about controlling the ball.  Actually I got that back, so I'm really happy about that.   
 Q.  First victory in two years.  Does this victory make you want the next one even more now?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think this is not the last one for sure, so as many as I can win, of course.
