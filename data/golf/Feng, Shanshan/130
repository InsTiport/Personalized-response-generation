 Q.   You're coming off what was a very, very good week.   How do you feel coming in, relaxing?   Everything was kind of crazy I'm sure on Sunday and Monday.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I was on the red eye flight Sunday night, so of course Monday I was really tired.   I mean, I had a (inaudible), so yeah, I didn't do anything else Monday ‑‑ Tuesday, I mean, yesterday I still felt like I was tired, and then I just practiced for a couple hours.   That was it.   I didn't even get on the course because I think that I know this course pretty well, and it's been so hot this week.   It's better to save up some energy for the tournament.  
My expectation for this week is usually after a player wins a tournament, then you actually give yourself more pressure because you expect yourself to do as well.   Sometimes you actually do opposite, you actually play worse.   
So what I'm thinking is I'm not going to set a goal, just try to keep the same feeling, same condition as last week, and just try my best.  
   
 Q.   Did you hear from anybody special from after when you won just in your travels?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I mean, everybody here, like after I arrived at the course, everybody here, they see me, and they're like, oh, Iko, Iko.   They don't call me Shanshan.  
   
 Q.   The fans here?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Everybody, they're like Iko, Iko.   It just sounds like my name is Iko now.   
   
 Q.   Did anybody call you or text you or email that that kind of surprised you?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, yeah, surprised me?   I was surprised because I was on the main channel, the CCTV, not the 5, CCTV itself, the main channel, like the news of the day.   I think Sunday night I was on there for 14 seconds.   So it's like CNN, like news on CNN, I was on there.   I'm like‑‑ I'm pretty sure that's the first time like news about golf is on there.   
   
 Q.   It isn't sports, it's mainstream news there?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah.   Usually it talks about politics, talks about presidents or something, and then Shanshan pops up.   
   
 Q.   It's like the president and you.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I don't know, I didn't get to watch it.   
   
 Q.   Someone told you they call you on CCTV?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, many people called.  
   
 Q.   So the aftermath of you winning, do you think it will still be a huge deal?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I would say I think it's good for everybody because I won a tournament.   Redwood is my sponsor, so sponsor is happy, LPGA is happy because now we can go for longer after three years, or maybe increasing the money or something.   It's good for the fans.   I'm pretty sure we'll have more fans next year and maybe more coverage, too.   I think it's happy ending.
