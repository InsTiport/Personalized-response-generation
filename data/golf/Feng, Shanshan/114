Q.   Can you tell us about your thought process on the 18th?   Were you aware of the situation when you were going for the green? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   Not really.   I hit a very good drive and forced my second shot, missed it in the bunker.   Missed a birdie, and after I finished, I look at the board and somebody is at 1‑under and I already finished.   I knew I wasn't going to win.   But this is my best finish at British Open so far.   Before this year it was like 22nd or 26th or something like that.   So I think I learned how to play the British Open.

Q.   How tough were conditions for you and everyone else today?
SHANSHAN FENG:   It was windy.   But I think we were being lucky because the first three days, we didn't have much wind.   So I think it's fair to just have one day of big wind. 
I thought I handled it pretty well the whole way.   Of course I had a couple of 3‑putts with the wind, but I think 3‑over is not a bad score today. 

Q.   Had you known your situation standing on the 18th tee, would you have played that last hole any differently, because you had made birdie the previous three days. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   No, I didn't play any differently.   I stick to the same plan, tried the 5‑iron, tried to hit it on the green.   But just misjudged about the wind.   It was moving a little more right. 

Q.   Your first Top‑20 in the Ricoh Women's British Open but it could have been a victory.   Do you walk away disappointed?
SHANSHAN FENG:   Not really.   My best finish here was maybe like 26th, and before I came, I was like, I wanted a Top‑10 so badly.   But I always struggled at the British Open somehow, and I don't know if I'm finishing second or third, but it's my best finish so far, and I think I learned how to play the British Open.   So I think I learned a lot. 

Q.   Did you know where you stood coming down the stretch?
SHANSHAN FENG:   Not really.   Well, I have a habit that I don't look at the boards like during my play.   So I didn't know, like somebody finished at 1‑under already, so I was still going for my birdie or eagle on the last hole.   But of course I missed it but I tried my best and I'm not disappointed at all.

Q.   You had a chance to get in the playoff with that putt at 18; was it just a misread, bad pace?   What happened? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   It was a misread.   Well, you know, the greens here are really hard to read, and I missed‑‑ well, actually, I read most of them right.   So I think I did pretty okay until the last three or four holes I misjudged like on the greens.   But I think I still did okay.

Q.   And just finally, your thoughts on Mo Martin, a player who has never been in this situation, and suddenly, now, she's played so well here this week.   It's pretty incredible. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I just saw her on TV.   She was warming up and I guess she just needed to warm up and she's going to win.   She was leading after two days, and I thought everybody actually wanted her to win because she's kind of a short player and on the LPGA, there are so many long hitters, and she's proving to us that you don't have to be real long to win like a major.   And she's so nice and she's always a very good player.   So I wanted her to win.
