Q. You've been playing extremely well this year.  I think I didn't even notice.  You've had 12 top 10s.  Crazy good.
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah.
Q. What's been holding you back from winning?  What's the difference?  You've been playing very consistently?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I would say earlier this year, like the first half of the year, my putting was really good, so even though I was making a lot of top 10s, but I was like seventh, eighth, ninth mainly, but then I think I made a little bit of adjustment, and now I feel more confident in my putting, so I've been putting well recently, and that's why I've got like seconds and thirds recently, and then I would say, you know, like I think in Malaysia I played really well this year, I mean, just because Jessica played too well.  It's like sometimes you'll bring out your A game but somebody brings out like a super A or A+.  That happens because the girls here are just so good, and anyone has a chance to win every week.  I would say even though I haven't won this year, I do feel like my condition is pretty good.
I won't be surprised if I win in the rest of the year.
Q. Did you change anything with your putting?
SHANSHAN FENG: Just a little bit, maybe more committed to my alignment and everything, yeah.
