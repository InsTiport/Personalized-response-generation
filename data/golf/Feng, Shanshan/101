 Q.  Shanshan, great round today.  How huge was that birdie there on 9?  
SHANSHAN FENG: On No. 9, I would say it was kind of a long day today, and then I did very well, and then I wanted to just make a birdie on the last hole, and then finishing with a birdie always makes you feel better, and also it would make lunch feel a lot better, too.  I think I'm in good shape going into the last two days.   
 Q.  How do you prepare heading into a weekend of a major championship being in contention?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I'm actually pretty happy about my tee times because I like that I'm playing in the morning today, and then I'll have the rest of the day like off, and then I can get well-rested, and hopefully not a very early tee time tomorrow, and then I think I'm just going to eat a lot and sleep a lot, and then not doing much like crazy stuff.   
 Q.  You always seem to play well in majors, and specifically here, two very good finishes.  What do you attribute that to?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I would say I like this golf course.  And I would say this year because the greens are a little bit softer, it gives us a lot more birdie chances.  My putting was going well today, so I think that's why I played well.
