Q. Shanshan, 4-under par through two rounds, 1-under par today.  What was working well out there today, and maybe describe your round a little bit from Friday?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think yesterday I had a very good round, so this morning I didn't have any pressure.  I think my ball striking has been pretty good.  I think one of the keys to play well this week is actually to be accurate, especially off the tees.  The rough is pretty long.  Some of the fairways are pretty tight.  I think that's what I did pretty well for the first two days.
I'm happy about the 4-under.
Q. How would you describe the golf course set up?  The greens are also running quite quickly out there?
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, they were great.  For myself, I actually like the greens to be fast.  I mean, they were a little bit soft, so in the afternoon they might be a little bit bumpy.  But I think in the morning, they are great.  The balls are just rolling perfectly.
Q. What was it like to play in front of these Canadian crowd?
SHANSHAN FENG: I was surprised, actually, many people they recognized me.  A lot of them asked when I was going to wear my cow pants, and I'm really happy to see them here.  I think what Brooke did for Golf Canada, it means a lot.  Compared to a couple years ago when Brooke wasn't on the Tour, now we have a lot more people, even on the Pro-Am day.  I was so surprised because we had so many people watching.  So I'm really happy coming back to Canada.
