SHANSHAN FENG: I think I just started the round, like 5-under is my goal today, and actually, 5-under -- not happy how I scored but if you look at my round, my ball-striking was super.  I left myself so many birdie chances.  I actually missed a couple out there.  I think that's a good thing to do.  I think that means maybe I can still make more on the weekend.  I think it's a good start.   
 Q.  You're easing into this championship in a very good defense of your title?  
SHANSHAN FENG: It would be great if I can do it.  I'm really enjoying coming back every year.  We always love the people here.  I feel really relaxed.
