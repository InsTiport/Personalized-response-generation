Q. Tell us about your round?
SHANSHAN FENG: I think today I was 3-under, and that's my first round in the 60s this year actually.  Last week was my first week back, and I didn't feel really comfortable playing on course.  Today I think I was back.  I was really comfortable and enjoying, and I was playing like what I used to play and ended up with a birdie on the last hole is even better.
Q. Do you feel like you've gotten the kinks and the rust out of yourself after taking such a long break?
SHANSHAN FENG: I would say I had kind of like eight weeks off, took the first three tournaments off, because I played Dubai last year, so my off-season started actually later than the other girls.  So I just wanted to make more time off.
Then I would say, yeah, first time back, I still have the tough mind, but the balls weren't going where I wanted them to go.  This week's better.
Q. You like playing out here, Thailand and Singapore, very warm weather, but you don't seem to mind it.
SHANSHAN FENG: I'm sweating so hard.
Q. But you look fine.  You maintain your composure and still look very cool.
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, this is only my second week out.  The first two tournaments are no cut, which I'm not under pressure.  So I think I just want to relax and try to warm up for the season.  I've always loved coming here in Singapore because this is a great week.  HSBC has done a fantastic job to make this tournament stand out.  I was just always looking forward to come back and hopefully I'll have another good week.
