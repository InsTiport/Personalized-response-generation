 Q.   All right.   I'm now joined by Shanshan Feng.   Just turned in a 4‑under 68 in the first round of the Kia Classic, just one shot off the lead.   Shanshan, very good opening round.   You got off to a really, really fast start.   Talk about that hot start for you and how that set the tone for the rest of the day.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I started the round, like really sharp.   On the first hole I had a tap‑in birdie and missed the one on the second hole and then made a long putt on the third hole and then made another one on the fourth.   So I was really confident after four holes.  
And then of course, the wind started to pick up and then it was kind of hard to knock it close again, but I still made the birdie at the last hole.   So I feel really good, because I've already had three starts this year but none Top 10 finishes yet, so this week I really want a Top 10.  
   
 Q.   Going into a major next week, how much does this course prepare you guys for almost a warm up for Kraft?   Do you think it's a good test of golf that gets you guys set for next week?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah.   I mean this course is really challenging and also next week, too.   So I think it's the same weather‑‑ well, it's going to be warmer next week, but it's just, you know, really good to, I mean play well here and then to give me like confidence next week.  
   
 Q.   Great.   Now, you took part in the Golf Channel shoot earlier this week on Tuesday.   Looked like you were having a lot of fun.   Tell us what went down at that shoot and what you guys were up to.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Oh, it was kind of funny.   Like all the fans, what they see, usually I'm so calm on TV, but I do think I have personality.   I like to joke around, and they gave me like almost‑‑ it was almost like Miss‑‑ you know, what's that?   
   
 Q.   Personality?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   "Mission Impossible."   Yeah, sorry.   Okay.   I'll do that again.   So it was almost like "Mission Impossible", because they wanted me to hit like a flower on the ground and using my driver to hit it in the air.   I was like, that is hard.   That was the hardest drive I've ever had.   And I did it.   So I think it was really fun.  
   
 Q.   Great.   All right, well, great job so far.   Best of luck the rest of the week.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Thank you.
