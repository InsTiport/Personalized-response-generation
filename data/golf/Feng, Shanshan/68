THE MODERATOR: So coming off a good finish last week and second event in Asia, how are you feeling today?  Are you looking forward to carrying over that success during this six-week span?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, of course.  I mean, the last weeks for me I had very good finishes.  I finished third at Olympic Games and fourth at Evian, and also last week in China.
So I would say I think my confidence level is much better, it's much higher after that.  So I feel more comfortable about my ball striking.  Even though I'm still not hitting the balls as good as I used to be, at least I know how to score on the course.
I mean, today it was really windy, as usual.  We knew that before we came because we knew that there was another typhoon going to come.
It was windy out there, but I think overall I did pretty well.  I mean, the score is (indiscernible) put my at 6-under, but I only shot 2-under.  I think that's not a bad score today, though.
