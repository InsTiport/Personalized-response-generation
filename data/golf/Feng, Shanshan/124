Q.   A nice back nine.   What happened on 17 or 18?
SHANSHAN FENG:   No, 15 is the bogey. 

Q.   Yes. 
SHANSHAN FENG:   That was the par‑3, which the wind and the pin position today it's like a pressure shot, and I chose just to hit it longer on the left side. 
Then went to the restroom, so it was my turn so I didn't really take my time.   First one I misread for like four feet, and then I just missed the second one.

Q.   Not that many low scores today.   Course conditions were tougher? 
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think today there was more wind, so it was more windy.   I think maybe the rain made the fairways a little softer too, so the balls weren't going as far.
I would say the pin positions were pretty hard.   So it was hard to get it close to the pins. 

Q.   Okay.   In general felt good about the round?
SHANSHAN FENG:   I didn't bring my A game today, but I'm still happy shooting 1‑under.   I think 1‑under is not that bad.   It's still keeping me to have a chance tomorrow, so I'm happy.
