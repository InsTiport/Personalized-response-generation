 Q.  Amazing round of out there today.  What was going right for you?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, first two days, I mean, my ball striking was pretty good.  I had a lot of birdie chances, but putting wasn't that great so I was missing some of the birdie chances and also the pars.  I mean, I did practice a little bit putting yesterday, so I think that now I figured out like 1000 putt.   
Today ball striking was good, and also, I mean, my putting was working finally.  So a lot of putts dropped, and overall it was just a great round today.   
 Q.  Anything different about the course from the last couple of days?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I would say that today they moved a couple tees up, so anything I think the course was playing a little bit shorter.   
 Q.  Okay.  
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah.   
 Q.  So this is an outstanding event here, especially with the new DriveOn campaign and the Founders.  How special is this event to you?  
SHANSHAN FENG: To me, if we didn't have the Founders we wouldn't have the LPGA and I wouldn't be here.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
SHANSHAN FENG: So I think, you know, we just feel so appreciated about it.  The seats over there by the 18th green and it says, Act like a Founder.   
So I think that's very important for us to do.  We just need to act like leak the Founders and ry to inspire the next generation and make the LPGA even better.
