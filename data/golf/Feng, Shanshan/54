(In progress. )
SHANSHAN FENG: -- it's time to wake up.  Even though it was early morning, but it's time to wake up.
Then I made some birdies when I was making the turn and then he was back to under par.  Then I felt more comfortable after that.
I think finishing with a birdie on the 17th was a pretty good finish today.
Q. You've won a number of times on the LPGA Tour.  Do you relish being in that leader position every time?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, my (indiscernible) leaderboard to even know what the others are doing.  I think 10-under for two days is not a bad score, and hopefully in the weekend I can still keep playing well and let's see what happens.
Q. You're a few shots off the lead now.  Are you going to change your approach at all to maybe be a little bit more aggressive tomorrow and Sunday?
SHANSHAN FENG: No.  I will just make sure I sleep enough.  This morning when I woke up I was like, Oh, am I going to play now?  (Laughter.)
So I will make sure I eat well, sleep well, and then play well.
