Q. A nice third round 68 for you today.  Your wonderful play here in Malaysia continues.  How do you feel walking off the golf course?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I felt like, actually today, it was really hot with no breeze.  I almost felt like I was going down, but I tried my best.  I mean, my ball-striking wasn't as accurate, but I think overall, 3-under, bogey-free round is still a very good score for Saturday.
Q. You're still bogey-free in the entire tournament.  What gets into you here at TPC Kuala Lumpur?  It clearly agrees with you.
SHANSHAN FENG: I think the important key is to find the fairways and to find the greens here and I think that's what I've been doing pretty well.  Even if I'm not on the greens, maybe the up-and-downs wouldn't have been too hard, but I'm just feeling comfortable here.  I'm not really trying to think about that bogey-free think.  I just want to keep the good playing going.
Q. Apart from the golf itself, how important is the relationship with the charity here for breast cancer research?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I mean, you are in pink, and I am wearing pink today.  It's Pink Saturday.  As a woman, of course, we want to support it as much as we can.  This tournament has done a great job and of course, Sime Darby has put a lot of money into this breast cancer research thing and I think they have done a lot for women.  I think we should just keep supporting it.
Q. Thanks to people like you, they have been able to do what they have done.
SHANSHAN FENG: Thank you.
