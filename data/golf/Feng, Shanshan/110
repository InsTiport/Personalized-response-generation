 Q.   Last week, coming off the win, you said you felt no pressure.   How did it feel in the aftermath?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I still don't have much pressure at all, even though I'm back in China again.   But I know when I have pressure, I just lose myself.   So like I did in Beijing this year, so I'm not going to do that again.   
I'm just trying to think about every week is a new week.   I just played really well two weeks ago, just trying to keep doing the same thing.  
   
 Q.   I don't think you can have too much pressure here.   Does it feel like you are on vacation?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Almost.   I mean, yesterday, we landed here late, like early Monday morning.   And then I feel asleep after I got here from like maybe 4:00 to 9:00.   Then I work up for breakfast, then went to sleep from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., so I slept a lot yesterday and you know, even more at night.   So I think I'm well rested.   
Even though I only played nine holes today, still I felt kind of tired.   I don't know why, maybe because it's hot here.   But it's vacation.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on the course?   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I played the front nine.   They told me the back nine was more like straightforward.   The front nine, we had a lot of blind holes, like dogleg holes.   So I played and it was playing a little bit long.   But the good thing was the greens were kind of soft.   Well, softer than I would expect.   And then I would say I didn't hit the balls that well today, but it's just practice round and I'm getting warmed up.   So getting ready.
