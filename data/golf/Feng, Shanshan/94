(In progress)
SHANSHAN FENG: On the green and missed a short putt, and today I hit the fairway.  It was a great drive.  Second shot I just hit a little bad.  Out there sometimes the lies are not very good, so I just, you know, made a mistake.
Then I thought I hit a very good fourth shot actually.  Got to like six feet, but once I hit it I heard it hit some rocks, like three rocks.
So it happened two out of two days on the 18th green I was a little bit (indiscernible) maybe.  I think I'm still in good shape after two days.
I think I overall I did pretty well.
Q. (No microphone.)
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, two more days.  This is a course that we can make a lot of birdies when we are doing well.
Three shots is nothing.  Maybe changed in like one hole.  That's not a big thing.
