 Q.   Top‑5 it looks like.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I would say if I'm Top‑5, I'm still happy.   Of course I didn't make many putts this week.   I think that's why I couldn't make a lot of birdies.   I think I made them all on the Pro‑Am day.   I made a hole‑in‑one, last like eight birdies.   I was like 9‑under the Pro‑Am today and the second day was plus four.   
But it's okay.   It looks like maybe I'm saving all the putts for next week, the China Open.   That would work also.   That's going to be my last tournament of the season, so I'm really happy, yes.   
   
 Q.   Do we see you back next year?   Is that part of your plan already?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think so.   Well, yeah, I think so.   
   
 Q.   And you're going to aim to win the tournament and not Top‑5?   You aimed for Top‑5 and you got it.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I want a goal that makes me comfortable to do it.   It's not like I have to win, and winner is only one, so you can't win all the time.   So I think that will give me pressure.   So Top‑5 is okay.   
   
 Q.   Do you think your game is still in good shape, considering you've only shot 3‑under around here but it's a tough course and the conditions are tough; you've performed well considering the other scores in the field.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I didn't think I performed that well.   Maybe that was because I played too well last year and Pro‑Am day.   I always thought this course was good for me but I just didn't nail it this time, but it's okay.   I'm human.   Can't win all the time.   
So last year, I won, and then this year, hopefully Stacy can win.   So in the two years in a row will be an OMEGA person winning the tournament, that's good for the tournament.   
   
 Q.   And how has been your shopping this week?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I'm going shopping now, so right after this.   Yeah, I'm going shopping to the Dubai Mall with my managers.   We haven't been shopping the whole week because I've been so tired, and so we are going to have a good time.
