Q. Happy enough with today, 3-under and still in the hunt going into the weekend?
SHANSHAN FENG: 2-under today, actually.  Well, I mean, of course, I mean 4-under is not going to be on the leaderboard, but I feel like in the past two days -- yesterday, my putting wasn't really working, and today, I mean, my iron shot wasn't very good.  The shot into the green, it wasn't very good.
But I think overall, I mean, 4-under is still not a bad start for the tournament, and we still have two days, and hopefully I can get everything together.
Q. Do you feel like you can go out there and attack it tomorrow?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, yeah, if I can get both my ball striking and my putting working.  That's always the plan.  Just wherever it happens on the course, we just have to deal with it.
