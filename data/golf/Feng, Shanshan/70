 Q.  7-under so far, and to have a tee shot left at 17, another hole, what was the key to your strong play?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think I didn't set any goals coming into this week, but I know that recently I've been playing pretty well.  Every week, I know that I actually get pretty close of winning.  So this week, I know that my record here is really good in Malaysia and I've won here before.  Finished second last year.   
So coming back here, I've had so many good memories that I'm really relaxed and really enjoying the week.  Of course, I think that really helps me to bring out my A Game.   
 Q.  We had the long rain delay today.  What did you do during that, because you came out on fire afterwards?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I just kept eating.  They kept updating like every 30 minutes, and like after every update, I'm like, maybe I'm going out so I should eat more.  I ate like three or four times before I went out.  So made sure that I'm full of energy.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  You have one hole left.  
SHANSHAN FENG: The 18th hole is a tough hole but it's good that the pin location is not the toughest today.  So I think maybe I'll have a full warmup in the morning and hopefully then after I finish the 18th hole, I can go directly to No. 1 and start my fourth round.
