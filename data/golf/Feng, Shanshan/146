 Q. What went right out there for you today?
 SHANSHAN FENG: Actually, everything was pretty good, because I had seven birdies and no bogey. So I always like the scores. 
 You know, I've had two top 5s here in the past. I think this course just fits me, and I feel really comfortable hitting on the course now.

 Q. I was going to say, you held the first-round lead last year and have played well here in the past. What is it about this course that fits your game?
 SHANSHAN FENG: I think because, you know, this course -- I mean, fairways are wide, so like long players, it's good for long players. We can always hits driver, get it down in the fairway like close to the greens.
 And then my iron shots are pretty strong, so it gives me a lot of chances for making birdies. 
 My putting is not bad this week. It's better than last week.

 Q. Are you feeling good about your game overall as you head into the weekend?
 SHANSHAN FENG: Yes, yeah.

 Q. In terms of you've been near the top of the leaderboard before, and you're kind of up there once again going into the weekend. Do you like being in that position?
 SHANSHAN FENG: Yes, of course. It means I'm doing well. Yeah, I really like to be on there.
 Maybe it will give me a little more pressure, because, just like I said, I enjoy playing on this course. I feel comfortable, so it doesn't matter. 

 Q. Perfect.
