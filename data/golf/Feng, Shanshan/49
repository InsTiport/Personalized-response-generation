 Q.  How was your day out there and what was working well?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I think overall I was very consistent.  I would say my ball striking was very good.  I mean, I had many birdie chances today, but I made some and then still missed a couple.  But overall I think I did pretty well out there.  3-under is not a bad score.   
 Q.  How does this golf course fit your game?  
SHANSHAN FENG: I like it because it requires a lot of accuracy, especially off the tees.  Some of the fairways are pretty tight, and the rough is pretty long this week also.  So like a player like me, I'm not super long, but I try to hit it as straight as I can, and that's really good for this week.
