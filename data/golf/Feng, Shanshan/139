 Q.   You don't normally look at leaderboards, did you today?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Not really.   I wasn't even sure if anybody behind was catching up, but I was just playing my own golf.   But I told myself if I can shoot 5â€‘under today, nobody could catch me.   
   
 Q.   What were your expectations and thoughts as you played the last few holes, you played well and presumably knew you were in charge of the tournament.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I mean, today, I think we had a little more wind so it was kind of tougher to play.   I looked at the board maybe on the 18th green, so that was when I knew I was leading by five shots.  
   
 Q.   You had great success as an amateur but as a professional waited four years to win and you've won eight times in the last 18 months.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think my first win last year in Japan really helped and I had kind of lost that feeling about winning.   I had a few chances but I just let them go, and I think last year, in Japan, in August, I was leading by three when I was entering the final hole.   
And then I would say to myself, if I don't hit a shank, I'm winning.   And then finally I won by two, and I think after that, I feel like I can win again.  
   
 Q.   What are your impressions of the OMEGA Dubai Ladies Masters and Ladies European Tour?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think this is the first tournament, not including the British or Evian, this is the first tournament I played on the LET after becoming a member.   I didn't know much, but all of the players are great and they did a good job.   This looks like a major to me.   
   
 Q.   The golf course itself, the conditions were great?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I know the guys played last week and I know it's very hard to have a course in good condition right after the men play.   I think it was perfect.   I was making putts.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your goals and your ambitions for next year, you've had such a phenomenal year this year winning your first major.   What are the plans for next year?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think I did great.   This year, I said I'm not going to give myself too much pressure because I'm a person who always sets more goals, small by small and I keep improving, so I would say next year, I want to win another one on the LPGA.   
   
 Q.   We know you love to shop and you said you're going to the mall and you've won a lot of money today.   Would you buy yourself a little treat?   These malls are fantastic.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   I haven't been to the Dubai maul but I was in the Emirates Mall for two days just for dinner.   I heard it had like 1,200 different shops, so I don't know how many I can shop tonight.   But I would say that definitely I'm going to get something for myself and maybe my parents, too.
