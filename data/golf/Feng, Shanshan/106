 Q.   Great round of golf for you out there, you're in a dominant position?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I think I did pretty well.   I think Charley definitely gave me a lot of pressure after ten holes, and then, well, and then it was kind of like a very big switch like for two holes, because I made 2‑under and she was actually plus three for those two holes.   And then there was a little more pressure off and I played well in the back, too.   
   
 Q.   The eagle at 3 really was key to get you going, really.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   The first hole I made a birdie and then I was 3‑under after three holes, but I was like, oh, I'm doing well.   And then my goal was actually to get to 20‑under, so now I'm 17.   So I think, yeah, still have a chance to get to 20.   
   
 Q.   Mel Reid shot a round of seven under today so she's currently five shots behind you.   It's a healthy lead heading into the final day.   I know you target a top three coming into this.   I should think that's pretty much achieved now and it must be just targeting that victory?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   No, I never changed my goal.   If I make it top three, I'm happy.   But of course, you know, if I have a chance to win, I'm going to give all my best.   I would say Melissa is a really good player, and I've played with her many times.   We are good friends, so I think I'll have a good time tomorrow.
