 Q.  5-under par today.  Happy with your round?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, before I started the round I told myself, I mean, it's time to try to go low.  First two rounds obviously I didn't play super well, so I'm a lot behind.   
I was trying to shoot low.  I mean, 5-under was still pretty good score, yeah.   
 Q.  Just one more round in your 2017 season.  What is your game plan for tomorrow?  
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I don't know how many behind I will be after today's round, but I think today I had a good round.  I still missed a few birdie chances out there, so I think tomorrow just try to go like 10-under.
