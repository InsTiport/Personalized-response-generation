Q. Lovely round of 67 today, an earlier tee time.  What was it like out there and what was the key to your round?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I think the weather was exactly the same as yesterday's.  The only good part was we didn't have any delays.  We just finished our round and we kept playing and it didn't rain.  I mean, it was great out there.  It wasn't too windy.  We were lucky because on some par 5s that we actually got downwind, and we could get it on in two and had a lot of birdie chances.  Overall it was a good round.
Q. Five birdies but always nice to have a clean card, as well.
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, I mean, today, I didn't -- well, I think my putting was a little better than yesterday's, because yesterday I think I had two 3-putts.
So I was a little confused about the speed of the greens because this week the greens are really slow.  But I think I did better today, so I didn't have any 3-putts and that's why I didn't make any bogeys.
Q. How much of a challenge was yesterday?  There were two weather delays totaling about an hour and 20 minutes.  How difficult is it to keep concentrated and stay patient with the delays?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I was still concentrated.  But I mean, the delays were so short, so we had to stay on the course and we didn't have time to warm up again before we re-started.
So I did make a couple mistakes after the delays yesterday, but yeah, I mean, it's the same for everybody.
Q. How do you like Kingsbarns as a course, as a links golf course?
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I love it.  We've been lucky so far because the wind hasn't been picking up yet.  I mean, it was peaceful and lovely course.  It's just a links course but a little more hilly, I would say, and harder to walk.  But I mean, I love it.  The course is in great shape and I can't believe it's a public course.  I mean, it's great.
