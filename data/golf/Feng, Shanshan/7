Q. So at the end of the day, was this the tournament you expected?  How do you feel right now?
SHANSHAN FENG: I actually feel really good, because this is the first major this year that I actually made the cut.  Actually on the first round after four holes I was 3-over.  I was like, Ah, I hope I can make this cut.
Then actually did pretty well.  I mean, came back to the red number to finish the first round, and then I think every round I've been red number so far.  Not many bogeys or doubles.
I'm pretty happy about my condition right now, especially my last tournament.  Actually I won the tournament and took two weeks off and went back to China.  And then coming back to this one, I mean, a second finish, I think it's great.
Q. Tell us about today.  These conditions were rainy and then kind of rainy and rainy again and cold.
SHANSHAN FENG: Yes.
Q. Have you ever played a tournament with this much different weather in one week - other than maybe a British Open?
SHANSHAN FENG: Yeah, maybe the British.  But I actually don't think it was that hard today.  Course was a little wet, but allowed us to try to go for the pins.
So I think there were still birdie chances out there, and the only thing was just the course was playing a little longer.  That was it.
Q. How do you feel now?  You said you came off a win and a second place finish heading into the final major next week at Woburn.
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, I haven't been in like the top three for like a while - actually more than a year, I think.
Then my last two tournaments I was top 3, including one win, so I think I'm very happy about my condition.  That next week is British Open, and I will say British Open -- oh, I've had a second.  So second was my best finish.
Then I just hope that I can keep this good golf going and then, you know, we will see at the end of Sunday.
