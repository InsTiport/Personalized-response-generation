Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?  You put the yourself in a really good position again.
SHANSHAN FENG: Well, you know, I have a habit I don't really look at leaderboards.  Right now I don't actually know, but somebody else told me Ha Na shot like 62 today.
So, I mean, it's really, really good score, and maybe she is leading by --
Q. You don't know.
SHANSHAN FENG: I don't know, but maybe a lot.
But I would say overall the first few days I've done well.  In the past three weeks I've had some very good tournaments.
So I'm just happy that I can keep on with my good condition.  Somebody shot 62 today.  Maybe I'll shoot 62 tomorrow.  Who knows?
Q. You think a 62 is there if the conditions are like this, raining really hard?
SHANSHAN FENG: I don't think so.  It will be really tough.  62 would be more like a 59.
