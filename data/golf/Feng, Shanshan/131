 Q.   All right.   I'm now joined by our 2013 rain wood LPGA classic champion, Shanshan Feng.   Shanshan, could you have dreamed up a better ending to this week?   I mean unbelievable?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, when I was going to the final hole I was one down, and the last hole is a short par‑5, which I thought Stacy was going forward, which she didn't, so I was like, oh, maybe she's giving me a chance for playing off.  
I never thought I would just hit the second shot so close to the pin I made the eagle.  
   
 Q.   When you saw that ball hit the pin what was going through your mind?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, actually that shot I didn't go for anything.   I aimed like at the center of the green, just wanted to have a chance to putt, and I actually pushed it a little bit, so it was ‑‑ it was right in line with the pin, but I thought it was a little short.   
And then suddenly while I was walking I heard the noise when I crowd went like, "wow!"   I was like, what happened?   I was like, it must be good because they kept going.   I was like, I must be close.  
   
 Q.   Well, it was more than good.   It set you up for your second LPGA Tour win.   You're a major champion, but this win has to feel so, so good.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Well, I would say I'm as happy as when I won the major last year.   This is our first time to have an LPGA event in Beijing, and Reignwood is my new sponsor, so I really wanted to do well to make them look good.   
And I think I did a great job.   I broke my low score for four rounds, and I think I gave all my best.  
   
 Q.   Well, what an amazing week.   Kudos to you.   Congratulations.   Thanks for joining us.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   So Stacy got off to a fast start.   I mean she got off and you kind of were trailing.   Obviously you were not going to give up.   You had no give‑up mentality.   What was going through your mind when she got off to that fast start?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   Oh, I mean she started great.   Of course, she started really great with four birdies in the first six holes, and I went from leading by one to down by two.   
Well, I knew that, you know, she's always a great player.   I expected her to make a lot of birdies.   And I'm always like, how to say, slow ‑‑ slow player.   Like I usually play better on the back side.   So I knew it was like an 18‑hole challenge, and only the first six wouldn't affect the whole result.  
   
 Q.   How big were the two birdies on 9 and 10?   That was a big‑time turnaround.   How big were those in a momentum shift?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I think I actually hit my second shots on the par‑5s really well today.   I mean that ninth hole I was able to hit it on by two and two‑putt it, which Stacy, her ball was pretty close to my ball, but she chose not to go forward.   So she gave me a chance there actually to get closer.   
And then after the birdie on 9, I got confidence again, and then tenth hole I just rolled the putt in, and we were tied again.  
   
 Q.   What about ‑‑ so the back nine, the back stretch was exciting, as I think everybody expected.   You missed a couple putts coming in.   You missed that eagle putt.   Talk about those last couple holes coming down the stretch.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Yeah, I mean 14 we both made bogeys.   That was kind of a tricky hole.   Both of us I think we read it wrong.   So we both made bogeys.   On the easy par‑4, the 15, we both missed a birdie.   Stacy has been giving me chances, I think, to let me catch up.   But I was a little nervous, and maybe because I really wanted to catch up, so I actually didn't perform as well as I thought until the last hole.  
   
 Q.   And then the last hole just you went for it, and at first you didn't think it was very good.   Did you think it was going in the water at first?   I saw you kind of ‑‑  
SHANSHAN FENG:   No, not in the water, but in the rough.   I didn't think it was long enough to get on the green.  
   
 Q.   And my gosh, tap‑in for eagle.   Could you imagine finishing off like that?   I mean eagle on the 18th hole to win.   
SHANSHAN FENG:   Actually it wasn't tap‑in.   It was like a three‑feet putt.   
   
 Q.   Three feet.   Was that a long three‑footer?   The longest three‑footer you've ever had?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   I mean last year when I won the major I had a three‑foot putt to win, too.  
   
 Q.   Which one were you more shaky over?  
SHANSHAN FENG:   But I ended up winning by two there.   I think this one because when I was over in the States last year, I wasn't in the final group, so not many people were watching.   
So this time I'm in the last group, playing with Stacy.   I mean we were the only two that were competing.   And then all the crowds were going for me, so I actually, you know, I started to aim, line up, and then the longer I stood there, I started to feel like a little shaky, I was like nervous, just wanted to get it done.  
   
 Q.   All right.   Well, awesome job.
