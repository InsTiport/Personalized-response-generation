Q. You seem like you are on cruise control out there.  What is clicking for you in your game this week?
SHANSHAN FENG: Like I said yesterday, my ball striking is always not bad.  I would say my only problem was my short game, my putting especially.  My putting was kind of struggling, especially at KPMG.
Coming in this week, make a little adjustment with my coach.  Putting is really working.  Also I got a green book this week.  Greens are really tricky.  I think that really helped, especially for the speed, also.
I think everything has been working very well.
Q. How different were the conditions out there today versus yesterday?
SHANSHAN FENG: The course played a lot longer.  My front nine, I almost had to add ten yards on some holes.  The course was already long and that made it even longer.  So I was hitting a lot of the hybrids and 5-irons into the greens.  Good thing that I actually hit them pretty well.  So that's good.
Q. What is your game plan for the weekend?
SHANSHAN FENG: I just have very good two rounds and hopefully I just keep doing the same thing.
