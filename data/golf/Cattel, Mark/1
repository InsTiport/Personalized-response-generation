MARK CATTEL:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  This past Monday was the celebration anniversary Pro-Am of the Canon Greater Hartford Open.  This year was our 50th anniversary, probably the greatest day for golf in the State of Connecticut.  Earlier this week, we had all the former champions back at the 50th anniversary celebrating the great tournament we've had over the years.  Unfortunately, some could not make it there on Monday so they came here today, and like to give them a special award for coming out and helping us.  We're going to go by year to make it easy.  1983 at Wethersfield, Curtis Strange. (Applause). Two-time winner of our event Paul Azinger, 1987 and 1989. (Applause). 1991, Billy Ray Brown.    (Applause). David Frost, 1994.  (Applause.) Our next one is going to be Stewart Cink, 1997.  (Applause). Last but not least, Olin Browne.  (Applause). Thank you very much for supporting our tournament for 50 great years.  We've had 49 great champions, and it will be 50 this year.  Obviously, we have to give well wishes to our Ryder Cup captain.  We won the Cup a couple years ago.  Curtis Strange is coaching the team this year to another victory.  Let's give a round of applause. (Applause).
