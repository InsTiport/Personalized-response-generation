 Q.  Very successful round.  Talk me through a little bit about it.  I know you had three birdies in a row there towards the middle.  How did you feel?  
SANDY SCOTT: I felt like I got off to a little bit of a shaky start.  I was just trying to just get things going.  I made a bogey on the second and I was kind of, yeah, I had some nerves going through the first few holes, but I managed to bounce back with a birdie and settled in pretty much there in the end.  I had three birdies on the end there.  I had, I think they were, all the birdies -- no I'm wrong, I holed one long putt and holed a couple of short putts on the next couple.  And that kind of gave me a bit of momentum.  I managed to just trust a lot of the numbers that me and my caddie were going with and, yeah, hit a lot of good approaches.   
 Q.  How long was that long putt, birdie putt you made?  
SANDY SCOTT: It was probably about 25 feet or so.  But the greens are so fast and there's so much slope it was, it felt like a 45-footer, so, no, it was good one to hole.   
 Q.  What did you think of Pinehurst and is this one of the first times you've been here?  
SANDY SCOTT: It is my first time here.  It's a fantastic place.  The facilities are incredible.  The golf courses are incredible and unique in their own way.  No, they're all, the courses I played, I only played 2 and 4, but they're fantastic.   
 Q.  What's it going to take to keep this continuing on into tomorrow?  
SANDY SCOTT: Nothing really much to think about, we're just going to do the same thing that we did today.  So I'll get some rest and we'll go through the same routine and hopefully post a number similar to today.
