 Q. Is this a great experience or are you used to this experience? 
 CHIEN SOON LU: I didn't feel that -- I tried to do everything I can and then I tried to enjoy the game and work hard. 

 Q. Do you have a base of operations in the U.S.? 
 CHIEN SOON LU: Yeah. 

 Q. You have had four top-10 finishes on the Champions Tour, were you expecting to finish so well this week? 
 CHIEN SOON LU: When I go on the course, since the first day, I just try to keep it on the path. 
 I don't want to do something aggressive. I think if I do it this way I have chance, even if it's Top-10. 

 Q. If you should win this, how would you be greeted back in China? How would they react? 
 CHIEN SOON LU: Of course everyone feel excited. You know, like not some sports are really famous, like baseball, golf right now, so everyone would cheer for me. 

 Q. So you would be a sports hero? 
 CHIEN SOON LU: Hero, yeah, hero! 

 Q. Your name, I've seen it with Lu the first name and Lu the last name --
 CHIEN SOON LU: Lu is the last name.
