  MODERATOR:   Chien Soon Lu shot a 5 under par, 65 today and is 2 under for the Championship.  
   
 Q.   Great round.   Seven birdies.   What was the reason for the low score?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   There's many putts.   Long putt is in.  
Mostly confidence.  
   
 Q.   Were the putts short, long, combination?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   Longer.   I just control‑‑  
You know, tempo very important.  
   
 Q.   Very good.   Have you got some questions?   Was 65 the lowest your score could have been, or did you miss some putts you might have been able to shoot lower?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   I saw he can definitely shoot it lower, because he missed the last three short putts.  
   
 Q.   What were the lengths of the short putts?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   About three feet.  
   
 Q.   Was it more about ball striking, or was it more about your driving?   What was the best part of the game today?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   Putting, putting.  
   
 Q.   Can I ask one?   What about this course, Chien Soon?   The hills, very hilly.   Tough walk?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   Yeah, yeah.   Uphill, downhill.   Go to the green.   Really tired.  
   
 Q.   Your legs?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   You look like you're in good shape.   You're fit.   Does that help?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   Yeah, that's a help.   He exercise every day.  
   
 Q.   Now, with your good score‑‑ Michael Allen is still 10 under‑‑ do you think you have it in you to catch him?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   I try to, top three, top five, maybe a chance.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you can win?   
CHIEN SOON LU:   64, I shoot, chance.  
   
 Q.   Very good.   Well played today.   Thank you for coming.
