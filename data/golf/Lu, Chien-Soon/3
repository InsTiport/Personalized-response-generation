  MODERATOR:   We'll bring up Chien Soon Lu, who shot a 68 today.   Go ahead with questions.

Q.   Very well done. 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Thank you.

Q.   How did you get to 2 under?   Was it‑‑ what part of your game was most effective today? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   I played‑‑ just drive, control the fairway, but missed two fairways and another putt.

Q.   How bad were your lies when you missed the fairways? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Second hole, par 5, I think maybe too set.   I hit harder, go to the left.   The grass is very long.

Q.   How did you putt today? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Putting's good.   Got a putt 12 feet, 15 feet.

Q.   How do you feel about your round overall?   You're 2 under par, first round of the Senior Open.   How do you feel about that position on the leaderboard? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Yeah, very happy to leaderboard and three more days, I keep going, maybe it's okay.

Q.   You've played well before in the Senior Open, had some low scores.   Does that give you some more confidence in coming to Omaha then? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Um‑hmm.   First time to the Omaha, but very happy here.

Q.   Okay.   Do you feel like you might have shot a lower score?   Did you miss some putts, or maybe hit it too far away on certain holes where you might have had a lower score than 68? 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Yeah, driver go through the fairway, I think it's okay, yeah.

Q.   Okay.   Very good.   Thank you. 
CHIEN SOON LU:   Thank you.
