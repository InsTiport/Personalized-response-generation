 Q.   How did your round go today?  
CHIN SOON LU:   Window and rain, but gusts.   Green, the speed's okay.   But I tried to hit the fairway and on the green, yeah, good.  
   
 Q.   What helped you get such a low score on the course with the bad conditions?  
CHIN SOON LU:   Practice is very difficult, but today I played well.   And it is okay.   
   
 Q.   What do you feel you have to do to kind of improve on or do the rest of the week to stay in contention?  
CHIN SOON LU:   It is okay.   Yeah.   Maybe try to play better and try win the tournament.
