Q. That was a hell of a reception, wasn't it?JOHN SINGLETON: Obviously didn't really play too good the first 12 holes, scrambling as well.  Should be short game coach instead of golfer. But I was able to switch it on there the last five, six holes.  I struck the ball really, really well.  And obviously finished birdie, birdie, par, birdie.  Great way to finish it.Q. Was there a difference from yesterday?JOHN SINGLETON: I was a lot more relaxed than yesterday.  I felt really comfortable with things.  Just wasn't playing well on the front nine.  All of a sudden found me groove, really.  Just started playing well.Q. Did you realize that you were getting closer and closer?JOHN SINGLETON: Yeah, obviously I wasn't thinking about, to be honest.  My goal was to be 2-under today.  I can walk away very proud.Q. What are you going to do the next couple of days?JOHN SINGLETON: I don't know.  I just want to get out of here after a little while, and just relax and take stock, really.Q. (Inaudible.)JOHN SINGLETON: Yeah.Q. Anything special planned?JOHN SINGLETON: Nothing.  I'm not sure about my plans.  I even haven't thought about that.  See what happens.Q. It must be hard to reflect early (inaudible).JOHN SINGLETON: The first tee.  Walking up the last time was pretty special.  Obviously I'm not sure what the cut was, but I don't care to be honest with you.  I was a little too far back anyway.  To get a reception like that was so special to me.Q. (Inaudible.)JOHN SINGLETON: Yeah, I couldn't really care about the eagle.  It wouldn't make any difference.  I tried, didn't go in.Q. (Inaudible.)JOHN SINGLETON: I think I'm going to take about a week off.  I don't know.  I haven't really thought.  I just walked off and finished off an emotional roller coaster.  So I think I have to come down from that and I'll see what happens.Q. It would be nice to know you outscored Tiger Woods today?JOHN SINGLETON: He's one of the best players in the world.  To beat him in a round of golf doesn't much.  It means something to me, but not to anybody else.Q. (Inaudible.)JOHN SINGLETON: Again, something to be proud of.  It's such a proud day.  Obviously the goal was to make the cut, and probably left myself with too much after yesterday.  Who cares?  I don't.Q. (Inaudible.)JOHN SINGLETON: I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to go back to work on Monday or not.  If I do, then, no.  I don't know what's around the corner.  I'll just take a few days and try and sort out my future.  And if I find out, I'll let you know.
