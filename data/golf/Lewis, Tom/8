Q. Tom, playing in your first WGC Match Play, quite a tough opposition I'd say for the first round.  How pleased are you with the half?
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, every game has been tough this week.  I knew that I was going to get a tough draw, being one of the last guys in.  Brooks is a nice guy.  I've known him through the European Tour.
It was a good day.  We weren't at our best.  I handed him the first couple of holes.  It's a bit frustrating but I'm pleased I made that birdie on the last hole.
Q. Absolutely.  The thing is, 17, that shot in, what a great move, gutsy shot.  And we're watching thinking, this match is going to go the other way right at the end.  How satisfying is it to deliver this sort of quality?
TOM LEWIS: I've been working on my wedge play the last couple of weeks, and it obviously shown through there.  I pulled it the tiniest bit.  I knew that the slope wasn't really going to kick in.  I was pleased to have putt for the winning hole.
