Q. Great start, 67. How was that for you?
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, really happy with that. Played really well all day. I holed an eagle putt on the last, made it extra special and hopefully I can just carry on playing the way I'm playing, thinking the way I'm thinking and if the putts drop, then you never know what's going to happen on Sunday.
Q. Going back to the eagle, after a dropped shot on a very difficult 17th to get your mind back on it?
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, it's a difficult hole. It's an accessible hole. Today there's going to be a lot of birdies -- not a lot but there's going to be a few birdies. I sort of chickened out and went a little bit right and sort of cost me. That's probably the only shot I didn't really commit to and sort of served me right a little bit. But if I can go out there and hit the shots I've been hitting and commit to everything I can, there should be plenty of birdies out there.
Q. Tough scoring this morning. What was the conditions like?
TOM LEWIS: It was swirly a little bit. Obviously for Dubai, no sun, that's not normal. It's a bit of a shame because we love coming here and seeing the sun shine and getting some tans.
But it was still really playable conditions. The greens are perfect. They are scary that way because if you start it off-line, it isn't coming back. I'm going to just continue to be as aggressive as I can and roll the putts well, and hopefully the course is nice to me over the week.
