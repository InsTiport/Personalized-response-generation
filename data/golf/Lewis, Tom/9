Q. Round of 65, and you couldn't have got off to a better start.
TOM LEWIS: I was happy with that.  We did really well, me and John, working out some numbers.  I was able to hole the putts and I wouldn't have asked for a better start.  Unfortunately I didn't kick on from there.
Q. A stat came up that you had 13 birdies in the last 12 holes.
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, I hit some really good shots and tap-ins a lot of the time.  Unfortunately I hit a poor shot into No. 6 and resulted in a bogey.  I didn't hole any putts coming in.  The last three holes, I could have easily have holed, you know, up-and-down the last, and maybe done a bit better.  But you know, I'm happy with the result this week.
Q. Was your best shot today your second shot on 12?
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, you know, that was a really good shot.  I caught it a little thin.  Came out a little low but squeezed out to the right.  I hit some really good shots out there, and that happened to be -- just sort of get away with it, a good miss.
Just pleased with the way I handled myself today.
Q. To finish in the top three, is a really good performance, isn't it?
TOM LEWIS: Yeah, it is.  It shows that I can go low over sort of the Friday, Saturday, Sunday period.  Hopefully if I can just start better, some tournaments, and then carry on doing what I'm doing when I do shoot 1-over, then maybe I'll walk away with a trophy.
Q. This week must give you a lot of confidence going forward.  I've had a lot of good finishes and continue to do that, and just see what happens.  If I can keep doing what I'm doing, I'm sure I can walk away with a trophy at some point this year.
