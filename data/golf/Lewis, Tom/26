 Q.   Tom, pretty impressive week for you, how did it go out there?   
TOM LEWIS:   Today was a bit of a struggle.   I got up early, a really good start and made a few mistakes there but I held it together well, and I struggled a little bit on the greens with the pace; to 3‑putt was disappointing, but hopefully I can work on that this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   What's your experience in match play over the years?   
TOM LEWIS:   I played a lot as an amateur, so I've got probably a bit more experience than maybe the other players.   I think they might have played more as a professional, but obviously I've played well in match play all of my career.   
   
 Q.   Probably your match‑play experience is more of an absolute knock‑out basis, and you're in this group situation; how are you going to approach that this afternoon?   
TOM LEWIS:   I think I've never played Ian in match play so it would be nice to get one up on him.   I know he's a great match‑play player in Ryder Cups, and hopefully it will be a bit more relaxed out there for me, but I'm sure I want to beat him as much as he wants to beat me.  
   
 Q.   Doesn't sound as if you're intimidated by him; are you?  
TOM LEWIS:   I think every player out here is a great player out here no matter who you play, and I'm just going to look forward to playing him this afternoon.
