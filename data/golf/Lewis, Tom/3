Q. Great start, 4-under par for you, but no surprises, really. You were third here last year and on back of a third place last week. What is clicking for you, and what is working so well?
TOM LEWIS: I don't know, really. My game overall, there isn't anything really bad or anything really great. It's just sort of solid. I putted better early on today. Greens were running well, and I don't know, I made birdies and I didn't drop any shots. That always helps.
Q. You are a Top-50 player in the world for the very first time in your career. How do you feel?
TOM LEWIS: Same guy, but it feels great. Took me nine years. But hopefully this week, I can better that and push myself closer to the 40th, and that sort of helps going forward. The Masters will be a big thing for me, PLAYERS, all those types of events. Good week this week can move up even more.
Q. Opportunities playing those events. Obviously that's where you want to be. That's where you should be. What do you do? Do you embrace that mentally or do you try and push it from your mind? What's the focus?
TOM LEWIS: I think you've got to treat every week as it is, exactly the same. Doesn't matter, just prepare as well as you can and hopefully the putts go in. Top-10s in these big events, there's a lot of points and stuff, so your World Ranking moves quite quick, forward and backwards. When you are in the position that I am, you have to try to treat it as if you have nothing to lose and try and stay aggressive.
