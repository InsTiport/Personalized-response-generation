Q.   Overall happy with that start?
TOM LEWIS:   Yeah, last year I started with 2â€‘under I think and I was pleased with the way I played today.   I played quite solidly.   It was a shame to drop a couple of shots on the way in, but that's the way it is.   And I hit a couple of bad shots, so I kind of deserved that.

Q.   How nice is it coming back, golfers talk about positive memories, how good is it to be back here as defending champion?
TOM LEWIS:   Yeah, you do, I have not obviously done that before as a professional and today I played great and remember the shots I hit last year, it definitely helped today relax out there and playing with Stephen and Henry today was a great draw, and they are great people.   So it was good fun.

Q.   Does it help, the positive emotions, the way you feel, you turn up at the golf course and you feel more relaxed and at ease? 
TOM LEWIS:   This year I fell on my back foot the whole year really.   I got off to a back start.   Whereas today, I got off to a nice easy start, birdied the first two out of the three holes, and that definitely settled me in and I felt comfortable out and I look forward to playing tomorrow.

Q.   Also a golf course where it does help the confidence; wide fairways and large greens and it does suit your game?
TOM LEWIS:   I seem to hit more fairways when it's wider and there's not many trees around.   So you know, today like I said I got off to a nice start and drove the ball well and definitely gave myself lots of opportunities and the greens are great.   Hopefully tomorrow I can make a few more birdies.
