   SCOTT CROCKETT: Thanks, as always, for coming and joining us and many, many congratulations, fantastic performance out there. You have spoken already about your delight and your joy, but just try to put into words what this afternoon has done for you.
 TOM LEWIS: I wouldn't have expected this at all at the beginning of the week. I got off to a slow start and there are some really good players here this week, so to come out on top was just unbelievable, especially so early in my career. So I can't really put it in words at the moment, but if you ask me in a couple of days or a couple of weeks, I'll be able to answer in better form.
 SCOTT CROCKETT: I presume you had a performance in mind when you went out there, and presumably it didn't get much better than this?
 TOM LEWIS: My target at the beginning of the week as to get to 10-, 15-under, and to reach 21 was excellent. I would never expected to have won. So I'm thrilled with everything I've done this week.
 SCOTT CROCKETT: When did you think it was going your way? I know you looked at the leaderboards; what did you think? 
 TOM LEWIS: I thought I was going to -- I don't know if it was on 13 or not. I hit a good putt on 14 and I saw the leaderboard and realised I was two behind; and I hit the green on 15 and 2-putted, really good. And I holed a really good putt on 16, and then I thought if I was able to win -- so I hit two great shots down 17 and two great putts. The last, I played really well. So I'm just thrilled. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: I was sitting with you when you were waiting; it was a slightly nervy wait, wasn't it.
 TOM LEWIS: I didn't really know what was going on with the scores. There was a lot going on. To come out on top at the end of the week, was it three shots -- two shots -- to win by two was great, and I'm pleased to be a part of The European Tour. 

 Q. We spoke earlier in the week about trying to match what Rory did in getting his card without going to Tour school and now you've done that - how does that feel?
 TOM LEWIS: It feels great. Rory is a great player and I would love to be like him one day. Just really happy I was able to win today. Like I said, I never thought I was going to be able to do that, and so to come out with a win just beyond my knowledge. 

 Q. When you were sitting in the recorder's hut, was your first bit of elation, now I don't have going to Tour School --
TOM LEWIS: I knew I didn't have to go Tour School when George O'Grady came over and said, "Welcome to The European Tour," and I was thrilled when he said that. And to have won was even better. 

 Q. You don't need an invitation for next week -- you're in now, but you're now playing in Shanghai, how will you do that? 
 TOM LEWIS: I have good people around me, and Adrian Mitchell, my manager, is a great guy and from IMG, I'm sure they will sort it out wherever I go. 

 Q. Do you have a Chinese visa?
 TOM LEWIS: Not at the moment -- no.

 Q. Are you going to Shanghai? 
 TOM LEWIS: Yeah. 

 Q. How do you react when people say things like you've won quicker as a professional than Tiger Woods did?
 TOM LEWIS: I've got a long way to go. I'm nowhere near the player I want to be, so you know, I'll put this win behind me at the end of the year and start fresh next year. So I'm really pleased. 

 Q. Was Rory one of your idols?
 TOM LEWIS: Definitely. Rory has come up in my age, and you realise how good of a player he is and what people think of him. And you know, it would be lovely to be like that one day. But I've got a long way to go. 

 Q. What is your relationship like with him?
 TOM LEWIS: He's a really nice guy and that's what's most important. A lot of the top guys are really nice, and they have been really nice to me. So it's been a really nice way of meeting them. I'm really happy and hopefully I can get to know them over the next couple of years more. 

 Q. Did you think you could possibly win on Tour in your first year?
 TOM LEWIS: I played a couple of events as an amateur in a pro event over in Australia and in Dubai earlier this year. I knew the standard was good. But I knew that I was able to win. I didn't have anything I didn't feel was weak enough that I wasn't be able to win. It was just whether the nerves and the mind was able to carry on and realise that I was able to win. 

 Q. Do you think the experience of playing with Tom Watson in the Open helped give you that stride forwards?
 TOM LEWIS: Yeah, I think that gave me more confidence. It was just a one-off. I had three bad rounds after that. So it wasn't a great week other than the first round. But to have great scores this week was even better. 

 Q. You said you'd been coached by Pete Cowen for six years - how did that come about?
 TOM LEWIS: The tournament director, David Williams, was actually the guy that introduced me to Pete, and I was able to get a lesson when I was younger, and I continued with Pete over the years and he's done a great job with me.  
 Q. So having David here as Tournament Director too must have been extra special for you?
 TOM LEWIS: No, it was really good to get presented with this trophy from David. He's a really nice guy and he's helped me over the years, so I'm happy. 

 Q. Have you known him since you were 'this' high?
 TOM LEWIS: Not that high but probably but probably a bit taller. When I was about ten, I used to play golf with his daughter, Lucy, who is a really good player. So to have his help, as well, and the knowledge from their past experiences on the Tour is excellent.

 Q. Have you thought about how you are going to spend  Â€416,000?
 TOM LEWIS: I'm not bothered about it. At this moment in time I'm just --

 Q. Do you have a car?
 TOM LEWIS: I have a car, yeah. It's a Honda Civic. 

 Q. The relationship with Tom Watson must be really special for you?
 TOM LEWIS: He's been really nice. He's said that I'm welcome to go over to his house and practise any time that I like. I'm probably not going to take that up; it's a bit extreme but he's been really nice and I'm sure I'll come across him over the years. 

 Q. I'm sure he'll be in touch with you soon?
 TOM LEWIS: Yeah, it would be really nice but I'm sure he's really busy doing his own thing. 

 Q. Going back to the Irish connection with Rory, can you talk about Colin Byrne your caddie?
 TOM LEWIS: Colin is excellent. Without his help this week, it was just -- to have his experience is excellent. I don't think I thanked him in the speech at the prizegiving, and I'm just really gutted now that you've just reminded me. 
 I'll make it up to him next week and try to get another win. But Colin is just a great guy, really down-to-earth, and I thank him for everything.

 Q. What was he saying to you on the second shot into the last? 
 TOM LEWIS: Well, we had a similar line. He was going more right than I was. But I thought I was going to put it right anyway, so I aimed a little bit further left. We are on the same wavelength half the time so that helps a lot. 

 Q. Do you know the Portuguese amateur who made the cut here?
 TOM LEWIS: Pedro, yes he's really good. You know, he's a really nice guy and I've known him over the years, so really thrilled that he played well this week. He'll come out in the next couple of years once he's finished university in America and hopefully do what I did and win an event, and hopefully in Portugal, I'm sure that would be his dream. 

 Q. Did you see him this week?
 TOM LEWIS: I've seen him over the past couple of days, but I haven't really had the chance to catch up with him. 

 Q. What do you do away from golf?
 TOM LEWIS: I spend time my girlfriend, she's really nice, and her name's Laura. She caddied for me when I won once as an amateur this year. She plays golf, so it's really good to have that connection. She can understand what I'm going through and that's great. I spend time with her and I play golf and have arguments with my dad and that's about it. 

 Q. Who is your football team.
 TOM LEWIS: I support Liverpool -- inaudible -- the other day, was difficult, we conceded a late goal to Man Utd which was typical us, and typical them to be honest!

 SCOTT CROCKETT: It was said at the end at the prize giving ceremony, that a star was born here today in Portugal. I think that was certainly true and we all enjoyed watching it happen. Well done.
