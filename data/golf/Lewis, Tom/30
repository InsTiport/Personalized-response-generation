   TOM LEWIS: I didn't play as well as I would have liked, especially in the conditions, but I was pleased with the way I finished and I'm still very much in the tournament if I can play well tomorrow. Links golf is what I've grown up with and so it may have played into my hands more if the weather had not been very good this week, but I always love coming up to Scotland to play these courses and at the moment it's exciting to be involved in such a great tournament as this.
