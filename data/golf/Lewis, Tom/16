 Q.   Hole‑in‑one, talk us through if you wouldn't mind.   
TOM LEWIS:   I had about 194 slightly helping off the right.   It was a nice 7‑iron and as soon as I hit it, I knew I hit it good, coming in high, and I said, that's got a chance.   I was just waiting for my dad's reaction who was down by the green because you can't see it because it's obviously raised there, the green.   So I was pleased.  
   
 Q.   And what was your dad's reaction?  
TOM LEWIS:   He just turned around and clapped.   I was just like, perfect.   I was just pleased I didn't have to putt.   The green there is tricky to read and obviously I hit a great shot.   
   
 Q.   Are you excited?   It's not every day you have a car given to you.   
TOM LEWIS:   Yeah, of course.   Last year I had a hole‑in‑one, my first hole in one, Royal Aberdeen and I won champagne.   So this time it's quite nice to win a car.  
   
 Q.   Put it into context for us, because that's a decent knock around here for Abu Dhabi the first day.   
TOM LEWIS:   Yeah, there was no wind today.   Didn't play as hard as it normally plays, but you've still got to be in the fairways.   The rough is very penal here, so when I was in the rough, I laid up.   I took my medicine and fortunately, two out of two times, I up‑and‑downed.   I made some good putts today and also missed a couple opportunities, as well.   
   
 Q.   Resolutions for a new year, new targets?  
TOM LEWIS:   Well, we have all got new resolutions.   We all hope for the best this we're.   For me I feel like I'm in a good place.   I've gone back to things I've done in the past, making things simple and I think this year will be a good year.
