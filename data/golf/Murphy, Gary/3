   GARY MURPHY:  A bit of a roller coaster coming in but 3-over is not a bad day, as well.   
  
  Q.  Trouble on 12, 13, 14, but you bounced straight back from there.   
 GARY MURPHY:  Yeah, I just hit a couple of wrong decisions with the wind, two 3-putts, four shots -- and bounced back with two nice birdies and got unlucky on the last, was in the rough and tried to lay up club just snagged straight left in the water.  Can't really allow -- overall it's a decent day.   
  
  Q.  At this stage, five off the lead, where do you think that leaves you for tomorrow?   
 GARY MURPHY:  At the moment -- Padraig's on top at the moment.  With five shots I'll need a good round tomorrow.
