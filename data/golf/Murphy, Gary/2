 Q. Gary, started the day five behind, four birdies in the first six holes, tied for the lead. Crowd starts swelling. What are you thinking and feeling?
 GARY MURPHY: I felt really good, actually. I felt pretty composed. I decided not to look at the leaderboards at all today, and then I looked at one walking off the 6th. 
 But I felt good. I played really well on the weekend. I didn't play well the first two days, but I played really steady and the putter held up. I've been struggling with my putter the last couple of months. I finally holed a few putts this weekend. 

 Q. You posted 7-under. Does it have a chance at all do you think? 
 GARY MURPHY: You know, I hope not in the sense that Richard is three ahead, and I wouldn't like to see someone finishing in an ambulance. But I'm just pleased with my week. I didn't look at any scoreboards from the 6th, and I had no idea what the putt was for on the last. There's enough dogs barking at me there anyway.
 It's just a good, solid week. It's great to play well at home. I've had a slow start to the year, as per normal. Hopefully this kick-starts my season.

 Q. Coming to this week, 140th in the Order of Merit, now leading Irish player here, big check, which will virtually get your card for next year. It's got to feel pretty good. 
 GARY MURPHY: Yeah, it is. It's been tough the last couple of months. It's quite stressful. It's quite a stressful job.
