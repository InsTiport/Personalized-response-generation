Q. Talk about your experience today?
JAIDEE THONGCHAI: Yeah, we played okay, but the guys, Rickie I think he putted so well.  He holed everywhere.  This tournament you have to have the putting well also.  You can't miss anything.  We had a lot of mistakes today with the putter, not in form.
Anyway, we have a lot of points to go.  I enjoyed playing.  For me for my thing today, the only thing you have to work on is your putter.  That's most important.  Because I know this format is really difficult.  You have to work with your partner.  Sometimes you're not confident.  Sometimes I have to make confidence for me.  I don't mind, we have a lot of play to go.
