  Q. Just tell me about the round a little bit; 71. You know, it was a little bit of a different day, but at 6-under you're still right there with two rounds to play.  
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Yeah. I played solid the front nine, drove the ball in play. Didn't necessarily hit my irons close, but I hit a good wedge in on par-5 and made the birdie early, and had a nice eagle putt here to 9, had about a 15-footer up the hill. So made an easy birdie there.   
 Lipped out for birdie at 10, and then I hit a good 5-iron into 11, about three-and-a-half feet for birdie and missed it. That kind of cost me a little bit of momentum. Missed the fairway on 13 and made a bogey.   
 And struggled, hit an iron shot, missed the green on the next, got it up-and-down. Three-putted 15, drove it on 16, went too far and three-putted, so I hit two three-putts at 15 and 16, and just kind of a day.   
  
  Q. Yeah. How about weather wise, Tom?  
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: It was a nice day. The greens, you know, John and I struggled on getting the ball to the hole. I mean with the dew in the air and the greens were a little bit slower, and we hit a lot of good putts between the two of us, and they just came up short about six to eight inches all day.   
 But you know, still there. Wasn't a great day, but I played nice on the front and had a little bit of a struggle on the back, but two three-putts hurt me.  
  
  Q. Okay. Good luck tomorrow.  
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Thank you.
