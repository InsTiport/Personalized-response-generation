Q.  Talk about your round.

TOM PERNICE:  Yeah, I hit the ball extremely well.  I drove it quite well.  I don't know if I missed a fairway to be honest with you.  I hit it once in the short cut on the first hole but after that I'm not sure if I missed a fairway.  So doing that, the greens were not ridiculously firm today.  So if you drove it in the fairway, you had some opportunities and I took care of them.
Q.  Any advantages to going out first?

TOM PERNICE:  Yeah, if you can wake up.  But other than that, the greens are absolutely perfect.  The condition of the golf course was immaculate out there being the first group off.  They put some water on the greens last night, so they were playing perfectly.
Q.  So an advantage?

TOM PERNICE:  I think so.  But the greens are holding up fine.  The second nine, they were just as good as the first nine.  So I think the greens are going to be good all week, and I don't think it's going to be a huge issue.
Q.  What about that putt on 18?

TOM PERNICE:  Probably just forgot to hit it.  (Laughing).  I wasn't too worried about the speed but obviously I should have been.  Hit a great shot in there, it was a little bit uphill and just didn't hit the putt hard enough.

I left a few others short in the heart, too.  I did that on 11, I hit a close putt and left it short.  Can't make them all and keep trying your best.  That's all you can do.
Q.  Overall, do you feel good about that number?

TOM PERNICE:  I played solid, absolutely solid.
Q.  You've been playing well as of late?

TOM PERNICE:  The last four weeks I've been playing okay, so I'm very pleased.
