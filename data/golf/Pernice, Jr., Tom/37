 Q.  18, that second shot, didn't make it over by much but it ended up pretty good? 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.:  I was in between clubs.  I don't carry a 3-iron and I had 210 into the breeze.  I thought if I took a 2-iron and hit it low and landed near the front and let it chase up there was my best bet, and that's kind of what I did and it worked out okay. 

 Q.  Overall on the day, three birdies and one bogey, it seems like an okay round when you look at the stats, 24 putts. 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.:  I putted from the fringe about four times so that's a little misleading, but I had three good up-and-downs coming in on 15, 16 and 17. 
 All in all I hit the ball pretty well really.  Kept the ball in play.  A lot of shots from along the edge of the greens but it's tough out there. 

 Q.  How tough is this course playing with this wind? 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.:  Well, I mean, that's the defense of the Blue Monster here at Doral is the wind.  We've had it all week and the scoring obviously shows it.  You've got the best players in the world who are playing, and the course is standing on its own.  We've got 20 to 25-mile-an-hour wind I would guess, pretty steady.  It gets your attention.
