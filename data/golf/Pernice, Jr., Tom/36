 Q.  Talk about the course today? 

 TOM PERNICE, JR.:  The wind was switching around more today than yesterday.  It's done some shifting from yesterday to today.  Once it's done that, you just don't know what club to hit. 

 I pitched the ball well.  I made a couple of key shots on the back nine.  I made a nice par putt on 14 from about 10 feet. 

 I've just got to hang in there, the conditions are so tough and it's not going to get any easier.
