Q.   What's your taking on shooting what, if I'm not much mistaken, is a joint course record here?
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Oh, is it?   Well, I'm thrilled, obviously to shoot 64 around here, but you know, we got a break on the weather today.   The wind settled down a little bit and actually started coming back the other direction here the last eight or nine holes, which made some of the holes play a little bit easier, so we got a little break on the weather, but it's nice to be able to take advantage of that and to have a great score.

Q.   You might have caught a break yourself, but you look at all those other scores, there's plenty that are laboring out there.   So you must have played well. 
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   I did play well.   You know, it was unfortunate, I was playing along yesterday pretty well, and I finished with six straight 5s yesterday, so I wasn't in too bad of shape. 
So I just came out today and knew that I was still playing well and had some good opportunities and capitalized and made some putts.
I had one bogey on the card.   I missed the green with a wedge.   I hit it in the bunker and had to chip out sideways, but other than that, I played very nice.

Q.   One of those courses that just meets your eye?   I'm sure you treat it with respect, but you see your opportunities. 
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Well, yeah you have to respect the golf course and links golf when they're this firm and fast, there's danger right around the corner, so you have to have a strategy and you have to know where the pins are and take your chances when you got the opportunities, and you're going to have to make some 20â€‘footers from time to time.   So I'm happy to get back into it.   Looks like Langer is the only one out there, Monty is having a good day at 4, 5, so you know, anything can happen around here, so I just got myself back in.   I was happy with the good day.

Q.   What is your take on Bernhard Langer shooting that score over two rounds?
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Well, you'll see Bernhard on a regular basis, and he's a great man and he's a great player, and I have the utmost respect for him and I always wish him well, he's a good friend of mine.
You know, he's fit, he's got a game plan, he works hard and he gets it done.

Q.   When you see that score and you're just setting out?
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   You can't pay any attention.   I had my own business to take care of today and try and get back in the golf tournament.   I've accomplished that.   So still have two days, so you never know.
