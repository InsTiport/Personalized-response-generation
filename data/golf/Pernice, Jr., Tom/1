 Q.  To be under par today, you had to play well?  
TOM PERNICE, JR.: I shot 1-under today, but yeah, that's a good round today.  It was a little up-and-down.  I had some theatrics on the front nine.  Played well, and then had a few scrappy shots on the back nine.  Was lucky to make some bogeys, actually.  But all in all, 1-under on a day like today, you can't complain.   
 Q.  Given the conditions, how good was that round to you?  
TOM PERNICE, JR.: Well, you know, I made some mistakes coming in.  I hit some bad shots.  It was a little disappointing, but it helps to make birdie on the last a little bit.  Makes up for the 3-putt at 17.   
It was tough out there.  You know that it's going to be tough coming home when the wind is blowing this direction, and just try to do what you can to keep it out of the bunkers.  I hit in two of the fairway bunkers today and made a couple bogeys there at 12 and 13.   
All in all, got to be happy.  I've got a good chance for tomorrow.   
 Q.  If conditions remain the same, do you feel good as a chaser if the winds continue to chase up?  
TOM PERNICE, JR.: Chaser, you mean chasing the ball on or chasing coming from behind?  Scores are pretty bunched.  It might rain tomorrow and still be windy.  You just have to go out and try to play good.  It's about execution and plodding your way around here and hopefully hole some putts if you can.
