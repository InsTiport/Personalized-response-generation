   TOM PERNICE, JR.: I'm not trying to show anybody anything. I'm just out there trying to play the game. The ball doesn't know how old you are. I'm just trying to stay out here and compete. I just love the challenge. Certain courses out here I enjoy playing still.
 I play well, I still got a chance.

 Q. How many tournaments you still got the rest of the year? You play a lot.
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: This one is finished, just the Schwab Cup is in two weeks and that's it. Tours are basically done.

 Q. Is that San Francisco?
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Yeah.
 MODERATOR: TPC Harding Park.

 Q. Were you leaderboard watching?
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Oh, I was watching. I saw Luke got to 17, but, you know, I wasn't going to be able to sit and figure out anything else. I knew Luke was at 17 when I got on the par-3, 15. I knew I had to make some birdies.
 He was at 17, I so thought, Well, if he maybe makes a bogey coming in, I could give 16 with two birdies. So I gave myself good looks at 15, 16, 17, and 18; I just didn't make any of 'em. They were all good iron shots in and good looks and I hit good putts.
 That's about all I can do.

 Q. Talk about the whole week.
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: At first I didn't think I was going to get in. Started off the fifth alternate, so didn't look very promising to even get in.
 You know, fortunate that I was able to get in and I played well. You know, I played well here before, so, you know, it's great to have the chance and keep going.
