 Q. Tough day for you today, but then you kind of got it toward the end, turned it around. 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Yeah, at least I finished strong but kind of knocked myself out of the tournament. I hit a bad shot on really No. 6, off-line, kind of fluttered it up into the wind and went in the water and made double there. 
 And then another bad swing on 10 and hit the bank and rolled in and made a double there and that kind of cooked my goose. Then hit a bad iron on the par 3 and made a bogey. 
 At least I made a few birdies in there, but very disappointing. 

 Q. Is there something that just wasn't going right today? 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: All out to the right: Hit a 7-wood on 2 went into the right bunker and made a bogey. Hit a 7-wood on 6 and went to the right and into the water. Hit a 5-iron weak and to the right at 10 and went in the water. Hit 5-iron to the right and weak on 14 and buried in the bunkers. 
 So, you know, I just have to go and work a little harder and know that's what my tendencies are and correct them.

 Q. What's next for you?
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Home for a couple of weeks.
