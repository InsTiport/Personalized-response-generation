 Q. I wanted to talk to you about your birdie, eagle finish. 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Well, you can't do it better than that. That's a happy feeling. You dream about those. 
 No, I hit good shots, a good drive and a good iron to 17 and a beautiful putt. 
 And then two good shots at 18 and obviously a good putt. So it's a great way to finish. It was a little bit of a struggle there at times, so it was nice to get some back.

 Q. That kind of finish kind of puts you right back into contention I would think. 
 TOM PERNICE, JR.: Well it gets you a little closer. I don't know, we got a lot of golf left yet, but it's nice to be back under par and see what we can do if you have two good days on the weekend you never know.
