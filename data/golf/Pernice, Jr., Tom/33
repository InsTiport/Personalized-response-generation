   TOM PERNICE:  Had a great opportunity to shoot pretty low, and just, you know, actually a little disappointed because I hit some really good quality shots.  I hit a couple 4- or 5-irons in there six to eight feet and missed them.  That's going to be the case for a lot of people, but it's a good start, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity.  I need to get a win this year and make the year a good year after it's all said and done. 

 Q.  What are your impressions of the golf course? 
 TOM PERNICE:  I think they have done a beautiful job.  I think the bunkering and the style of the greens is beautiful.  It's a fun course to play.  You need to maneuver the ball around.  There's different ways you can hit driver on some holes, you lay up on some holes; I think it's good. 
 You know, I think it's playing good.  The people here I think made a good decision not to overseed and play all bermuda.  Hopefully they can say away from the overseed here and the course will get better and better years to come. 
 I want to thank the Fry's people for stepping to the plate because this is going to be a nice event until they get up to their tournament in San Jose in three years.
