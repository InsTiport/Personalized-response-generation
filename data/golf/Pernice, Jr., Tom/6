 Q.   How did you play from start to finish today?  
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Not as good as I had the first two days.   First two days, I hit the ball beautifully, just didn't hole a lot of putts.   
Today it was some good shots, a few loose shots, but I made a bogey on the par‑3, that was my only bogey today.   So that was fine to‑‑ but I only had three birdies.   But all in all, any time you shoot under par, it's not going to hurt you.   
   
 Q.   Talk about that stretch where 12 holes you had 11 pars and a birdie.   You must have been hitting the ball well in that stretch.   
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Not always.   Sometimes pretty good shots.   Had to make a couple good saves at times.   And I started off hitting the ball a little bit better and then had to get up‑and‑down for par at 16, the par‑3.   I hit it in the front bunker.   So, but I hit a good bunker shot out about four feet.   So it was a good save.   
And I had good birdie chances at 15, just didn't make it.   
14, I hit the flag.   It looked like it was flying in, it hit the flag and went all the way off the green.   So a bit unlucky there, but that happens.   
And I had a good birdie chance at 16, the par‑3 and just lipped it out.   
So, obviously looking to do a little bit more as far back as I was starting the day, but I hung in there and got a couple under, so still have a shot tomorrow, if they don't go too low today.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel going into Sunday?  
TOM PERNICE, JR.:   Depends.   We'll see how far back we are.   But if the wind gets back up like it was when we started this morning, if the leaders don't run away, you always have a chance.   But just have to wait and see.
