 Q. Nice little 65, 5-under par to open up. You have to be happy. 
 TOM PERNICE: Yeah, very happy. I kind of stole one there at the last. I drove it in the rough and then hit it in the bunker and holed it out of the bunker, so that was a nice way to end the evening.

 Q. You had six birdies today, one bogey. Take us through your round. 
 TOM PERNICE: I got off to a good start. I hit it a couple feet at 1 and I hit it about three feet at 2, so I got off to a nice start. Made a birdie at the par-5, No. 6, and then three-putted No. 8. So I had a solid front nine, hit the ball well, had a lot of opportunities. 
 And then a little bit scrapey on 10, got up-and-down out of the bunker, hit it about two or three inches. My bunker play was great today, really saved me. 
 And then knocked it in front of the green on the par-5, got it up-and-down and chipped it a foot. 
 Then the short hole, drove it right in front of the green, pitched it up there two or three feet and stole one at the last, so very happy.

 Q. What's your sense out here? Is the course here for the taking with benign winds and beautiful conditions, kind of soft on the greens?
 TOM PERNICE: Yeah, the greens are soft and they're not very fast, so if you can get your speed on the greens you can make a lot of putts, plus there's no wind here, and we usually have a little bit of breeze here. So yeah, the scores are obviously low and the good weather is allowing it to happen.
