 Q.  Overall top-10 finish on this course, what are your thoughts on the weekend?  TOM PERNICE, JR.: I played well.  Extremely difficult golf course.  Very little room for error.  I hung in there, I guess.  Hit the ball all week.  A little struggling on the greens, more or less. But I didn't hole enough putts.  You got to hole some 15, 20 footers on this golf course, because you can't hit it close all the time.  But would like to have shot under par, bogeyed the last to get back to 1-over for the week, but all in all a good solid week.   Q.  How do you feel about the round today?  TOM PERNICE, JR.: Good.  It was tough out there today.  Bogeyed the first hole, missed it from the middle of the fairway, made a bogey.  Missed one on the last hole and made a bogey.  Other than those two holes I held it together pretty good.
