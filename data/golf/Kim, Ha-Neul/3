  CHRISTINA LANCE:   We are here with our clubhouse leader, our final leader of the day, Ha‑Neul Kim from Korea, with an amazing 6‑under 66, six birdies, no bogeys.   Ha‑Neul, how did you feel out there?   You played very well. 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   I had six birdies today.   They were all within tap‑in range, so I felt like my putting wasn't really tested, but my tee‑to‑green I was very good.

Q.   You seem a little stunned that you're actually in the lead.   Is that true? 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   I was very nervous coming in, and I thought in the practice round that the course was very difficult.   Before playing today I thought that even par would be a very good score for me.

Q.   Can you tell us a little bit about your golf background?   When you started to play and, up to now, what's been the biggest moment in your career as a golfer? 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   I was 12 when I started at Gold Country Club.   I was at the driving range for a year at the age of 12, and then after a year, I started playing at Gold Country Club near Seoul.

Q.   What is the biggest win? 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   The Hite Cup on the KLGPA.   It's a major in the KLPGA.   In 2011.

Q.   Have you been following Inbee's year so far, and would you be surprised that you're actually beating her by a shot after the first round? 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   When Inbee shot 6, she said to herself, wow, how did she shoot that score?   And then she went out and beat her.

Q.   It is your first Women's Open:   Were you nervous?   Were you excited?   How did you feel coming in to this week? 
HA‑NEUL KIM:   I'm enjoying myself.   I'm just happy to be here and to be playing in this big event.   I'm not really thinking about winning or results but enjoying the moment.
