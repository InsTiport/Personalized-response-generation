  HA‑NEUL KIM:   My irons were not good and my greens in regulation, bad. 

Q.   Greens in regulations, bad.   Was that because of the wind or because of the way you played?
HA‑NEUL KIM:   The way I played.

Q.   Were you upset about that?
HA‑NEUL KIM:   No, no, no.   I'm entered. 

Q.   Still having fun at the Women's Open?
HA‑NEUL KIM:   Yeah.
