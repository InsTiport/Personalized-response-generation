Q.   Clean round today.   You're at 11-under.   How does it feel to be near the lead going into Sunday?
SCOTT PINCKNEY:   Feels awesome.   I played great today.   Kept the ball in play.   Didn't make any mistakes, which was nice.

Q.   What was the key to your round today?
SCOTT PINCKNEY:   Staying patient.   Not trying to force things because I made a couple good putts early and started to miss a couple birdie putts and I knew coming down just needed to hit good shots.   But pretty much just staying patient was my key today.

Q.   In contention going into Sunday.   What do you need to focus on tomorrow to have a good day?
SCOTT PINCKNEY:   Just the process, just trying to hit good shots and putting them in the right spot.   Trying to putt well and just have fun, pretty much.
