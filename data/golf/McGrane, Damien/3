Q.   How do you feel after three days?
DAMIEN McGRANE:   I might look a little scoring, I thought scoring would be a lot more competitive at the moment but the course is very difficult, and I've had another steady today, and looking forward to backing it up again tomorrow.

Q.   Lovely surge on the back nine to really get in the mix?
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely.   Pity I didn't convert to birdie on 15, which is a bit disappointing and I struggled on 16 and 18 today.   But all in all, I played a lot of good shots, and even when I made bogeys, I was making bogeys off reasonable shots, not poor shots.   So that's convincing.

Q.   We are making you squint in the sunshine, but it's worth saying that this is a tricky day again. 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Absolutely, it's blustery and the wind has turned around quite a lot so it's hard to know whether you're with the wind or slightly hurting coming home so it's difficult to pick the right club out there.   It's a good course and it's playing really well this year.

Q.   And playing differently, as well, because those greens are baked compared to what we normally find in south Wales. 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely.   We played here and got a lot of rain in the past but at the moment it's good.   It's turning a little fiery now and nice to play The Wales Open in these conditions.

Q.   You've been in nice form, anyway, with Sweden, France and other tournaments, as well?
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, I'm just waiting for a good week on the board.
