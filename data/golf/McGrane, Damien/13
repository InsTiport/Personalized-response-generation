  Q. Tell us how good that was.   
 DAMIEN MCGRANE: I played well from start to finish. I hit a lot of good shots and a lot of fairways and finished with two birdies was a nice, strong finish which gets me right up there.   
  
  Q. Nice position on the leaderboard now?  
 DAMIEN MCGRANE: Absolutely and there's two days left, so all to play for.   
 My golf has been very average the last few weeks and I'm glad to be back with a good rub of the green at the moment.   
  
  Q. What are your opinions on this golf tournament and golf course?  
 DAMIEN MCGRANE: I like this course. It's very soft at the moment. It gives a lot of opportunity, if you play well and you're tidy out there, you can have plenty of efforts for birdies, but the greens are tough to read as well, so you have to pick your chances carefully when they come along.  
  
  Q. Good conditions given the heavy rain?  
 DAMIEN MCGRANE: Yeah, it's a joy and beautiful place to play golf.   
  
  Q. Is this the sort of form you want to be going into Birkdale?   
 DAMIEN MCGRANE: You know, you need to be playing well. It's nice to -- my golf has been out of sorts lately and it's nice to play two solid rounds this week so far and it's just what you want before.
