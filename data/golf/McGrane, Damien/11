   DAMIEN McGRANE: I struggled off the tee but putted very well to make plenty of birdies which was nice. I hit some good shots for short birdie chances and holed a few long ones as well. All of the sudden, when you're working hard for par, you get a birdie. The greens here are good, if you putt well, you'll do well. Obviously I will need to work on my driving.  
 It's a good start. This is something I can build upon, especially on the first round. Scoring is so good these days and you need to make birdies.  
The course is great, the Tour is being sensible by watering the greens. They are holding. With the sun being so strong, you don't want to lose the greens.
