Q.   Nice result for the week, isn't it? 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, I'm very satisfied.   You know, I played lovely all week and I hit a lot of good shots and converted a couple of long putts again today for birdies on tough holes. 
So birdieing I think 14, maybe 13, 14 today, I think I birdied them yesterday, as well, it was a huge result, the difficult holes, and I was probably catching two or three shots in the field.   But it's a tough finish here in Wales, and you know, I managed to crawl my way home, so I'm happy enough.

Q.   That was a lovely stretch because it was three birds in four holes and you suddenly just moved back into nice contention?
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely.   It was nice to do‑‑ often in golf it falls the other way but today the ball bounced in my direction and I managed to move up from the field which was pleasant. 
I'm content to have played four solid rounds this week.   Consistency often is my problem this year, so four steady games, I'm pleased.

Q.   Things working out with the new caddie? 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, it's part and parcel of the business, I must move along.   I had John for so many years and he served me very, very well.   It was time for a new change, and you know, the signs are there, maybe it will be a good change.

Q.   Sometimes beds in quickly and sometimes it takes a while. 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely, but if the golf is good, all these other things around, the periphery, don't seem to matter so much.

Q.   And as for Horty, he has got a nice wedding coming up. 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely, it's fantastic for him.   He's getting married at 60, not many of us can brag that one.   I wish him all the best, he's a great guy.

Q.   Good boost for the season's events to come? 
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, absolutely, I'm looking forward to it.
