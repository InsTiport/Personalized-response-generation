 Q.   Your thoughts on backing up a good first round?   
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, I played nicely again today.   Putter didn't work quite as well and missed a few fairways as well but it keeps me there or thereabouts.  
   
 Q.   Presumably a lot of satisfaction on the first day, no particular frustration today?   
DAMIEN McGRANE:   No, no, I kept it simple as best I could.   I stuck to my game plan and weather is beautiful.   So it yields plenty of opportunities.   
   
 Q.   It has been a place where you enjoy coming and playing?  
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, I enjoy the course.   It's not all about length.   It's about strategy and position.   I enjoy the course and I always enjoy my three weeks in Dubai.   
   
 Q.   Thinking back to the year you had your greatest year, that was probably all kick started here, wasn't it?  
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Absolutely.   I have fond memories, going back a few years now, but the course changes from year‑to‑year and I'm that little bit older so possibly have to work a little bit harder.  
   
 Q.   What are those memories?   I seem to recall one of them was laying with Tiger Woods?  
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yeah, played with him so that was good at the time.  
   
 Q.   When are your thoughts going into the weekends?   
DAMIEN McGRANE:   I'll probably need to do the same again or slightly better but it's all in front of me now.   
   
 Q.   Do you get a sense that the conditions get harder of an afternoon; that the pack might come back just that little?  
DAMIEN McGRANE:   Yesterday proved to be a little bit more difficult and I think the wind might reappear this afternoon.   But as I said, the forecast is for a little bit of air, so wait and see what happens.
