 Q. What did you hit for the tee shot on the last? 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: 5-wood. Just went about 50 yards right-to-left in the air, because as I said, the wind is very strong now. It's just one of those things. I went 36 holes. 

 Q. 17, have you had to wait so long? 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: Yeah, it's one of those things, I suppose. Stood on the back of the green for 15 minutes. That's golf. PÃ¡draig, he struggled in his own way, but he did have a very strong finish, so it's what he does best. 

 Q. Your own position at halfway?
 DAMIEN McGRANE: Well, obviously I have work to do now over the weekend but you're never going to come here and not have work to do on the weekend.

 Q. When you're playing with PÃ¡draig and all of this stuff is going on, is it as entertaining for you as it is for us?
 DAMIEN McGRANE: You have to laugh. You have to laugh. I can laugh at it all, so it helps.

 Q. When it hit the back of the hole --
 DAMIEN McGRANE: It was incredible, yeah, but it's golf and it's what happens out there and it's nice to see it in an Irish Open.

 Q. How long was your putt at 17? 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: I hit a good chip shot and finished about six feet left of the hole.

 Q. You waited 15 minutes to play the putt. 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: I didn't wait 15 minutes to play the putt. I waited 15 minutes in total just hanging around but just one of those things.
