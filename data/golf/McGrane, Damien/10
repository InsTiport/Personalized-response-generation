 Q. Good start? 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: Yeah, absolutely. I didn't get a practice round because I played in the JP McManus Pro-Am. Came over here and to be honest I know the course pretty well. Hit a lot of good course. 
 I suppose the key was the greens were a bit bumpy this afternoon and whenever I hit a wedge or sand wedge, I hit it inside six feet every time. So I made a couple of soft birdies which was nice.
 The course was good and I'm looking forward to getting slightly better greens tomorrow morning.

 Q. Was that in your mind in terms of going for things?
 DAMIEN McGRANE: Once you're hitting in wedges, you're always going for flags but today I managed to backspin a few of them very close to the holes and made easy birdies and that's what you need to do because out there it's extremely difficult to hole a long putt. 

 Q. How has the form been, all right?
 DAMIEN McGRANE: I've been playing quite well. Just been waiting trying to get four days out of it. I'm playing well for three days and average on one, and obviously you can't win doing that. Trying to keep doing the same things like I've always been doing and keep it simple. I'm playing a lot of good golf and I've been doing it for a while now. 

 Q. Nice time of the year to be doing it. 
 DAMIEN McGRANE: Yeah, when you're playing well, you're putting yourself in position all the time whether it's winter or summer. I've been playing well and long may it last.
