Q.  What happened at 18?
DAMIEN McGRANE:  I was trying to keep my second shot right of the pin and I pushed it slightly into the bunker. Played a reasonable bunker shot but the putt slipped by from about six feet.
Q.  Bit frustrating?
DAMIEN McGRANE:  I take the rough with the smooth these days. I was in perfect position to finish with a birdie and get within one shot of Darren and being in the last group, but it didn't pan out. Overall, though, I've got more in my favour than has gone against me this week, so I'm not going to complain too loudly over one shot.
Q.  Your figures suggest you were striking it well?
DAMIEN McGRANE:  Yes, I was. I have been finding most of the fairways and that makes it as easy as possible for myself. I am hoping for more of the same over the weekend.
Q.  Has this been coming or was in totally unexpected?
DAMIEN McGRANE: I have been waiting for things to happen. My golf's been iffy for a few months but it has been improving and I think it's getting close now.
Q.  Pity you are not playing with Darren tomorrow?
DAMIEN McGRANE:  Oh, yes. Darren is a great guy to play with and he's a fantastic player and really he's got it all.
Q.  Lot at stake this week?
DAMIEN McGRANE:  Yes, there is the Open exemption and the title, of course. Everybody has their own agenda. Just wait and see. Winning would be perfect and making everything else academic!
