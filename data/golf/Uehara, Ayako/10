 Q.  How does it feel to be in this position in a major championship?  
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah, I'm so excited right now because I'm just one shot behind, so I played two days good, so I'm very happy to play tomorrow.   
 Q.  What was the key for you so far this week in playing so well?  
AYAKO UEHARA: I think I hit pretty good shots, and putting also good and not unlucky, so hopefully tomorrow lucky again.   
 Q.  This is Ai Miyazato's final event.  How much has she inspired you to play well with this being her final event?  Did you look up to her at all as you were growing up in your career?  
AYAKO UEHARA: When I was amateur we played together, and also we are good friends, so tomorrow is her last event, so I'm so sad, but after she retires, she can do like a good more second career, so I want to cheer for her.   
 Q.  How comfortable do you feel in this position going into the final round?  Do you like this position coming from behind?  
AYAKO UEHARA: First time playing major final group, so right now I'm so excited.  But I think tomorrow I'll be nervous, but I want to enjoy everything.
