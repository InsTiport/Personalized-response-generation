Q. 10-under through round 3.  You did so awesome.  Four birdies throughout the whole day against two bogeys.  What was working for you today?
AYAKO UEHARA: I think the golf course is getting like fast and firm, but today I'm working with Bob, and we did, I think, a good job.
Q. You have made it to the weekend, did awesome today.  What is your mental game preparation like going into tomorrow's round?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah, I think not much different, but I think golf course is a little bit tougher because the greens are firm, and so that's why I need good rest tonight, and then next day wake up more fresh, and I want to do more smarter.
Q. Do you think you really do well and have a lot of success on these types of golf courses with firm greens that are rolling pretty fast?
AYAKO UEHARA: Actually my ball flight is low, so I think it's tough for me, but I think this week I'm doing okay and doing good.  I need one more like smart play and then I want a good finish.
Q. Why do you think everything is coming together this weekend?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah, Bob helped me a lot, and also, until last week, I had a putting problem, but this week I made a lot of good putts.  That's why it's different, I think.
Q. And I think -- did you change a putter?
AYAKO UEHARA: No.
Q. So same putter?
AYAKO UEHARA: Same putter.
Q. Just different feeling, different week?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
Q. Because you practice a lot; I saw you last week in Canada practicing a lot.  Do you feel more confident going into tomorrow's round?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yes.
