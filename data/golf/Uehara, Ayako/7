Q. Round 2 in Portland, you played so well today, six birdies total against two lone bogeys.  Back-to-back 4-under.  You must be feeling pretty good about your game.  What was working so well for you out there?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yes, this week Bob, my caddie, helped me a lot, at reading putts, and I made a lot of good putts.
Q. You've missed four cuts in your last four starts.  You must be feeling pretty good about your game and where you are right now, your position.  Last week we saw you practicing putting.  Is that what you've been working on lately?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yes.  Actually a lot of missed cuts, and everything like putting program.  But this week, I made a lot of good putts, and I can play the weekend, so I'm very excited about it.  I will keep going on and making a lot of birdies.
Q. Did you make any changes to your equipment that helped you?
AYAKO UEHARA: I changed -- usually I did it myself, but this time, this week, like a lot of reading, Bob was reading my putts, so that helped.
Q. Your caddie, Bob, says that you really like this course.  Did the course play any different with the rainfall that happened overnight?
AYAKO UEHARA: Actually not much different.  A little bit of rain, but still, the greens were pretty firm.
