Q.   Very solid day.   How big of a factor was the wind? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   It was extreme.

Q.   It got worse throughout, the wind, you think? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   It was all the way, like since early in the morning, it's the same.

Q.   What was working for you today?   What did you think was really strong of your game? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Club selection was good.   Even though I had 3‑putted a couple of times, or once, twice, two or three times, however, basically, my putting was very good. 

Q.   Talk about 15, 16, 17, all those birdies.   Did you make some good putts on those? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   My putting was just as I imagined, planned.   It went in, it was pretty long. 
16 was very long, 15‑footer, kind of. 

Q.   How did you do at Kraft? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   I missed the cut.

Q.   What did you do in the off week?   Did you work on anything specifically? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Nothing special, but my cousin lives in San Diego.   Swinging Skirts, the new course in San Francisco.

Q.   You went and played it?
AYAKO UEHARA:   Two days.

Q.   You went and played two days up there?   What did you think of the course up there? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Very, very difficult. 

Q.   So you didn't take too much time off, you went out and practiced and grinded? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   I did some touristy things at the same time as I practiced.

Q.   What did you do? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Even here in Hawai'i, hiking, it's really hilly or a mountain.   My caddie told me where to go.   There's a waterfall, and then I swam over there in the waterfall. 

Q.   What did you do in San Francisco? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Two rounds of practicing. 
Downtown San Francisco, Fisherman's Wharf.   I didn't see the bridge or anything.   I was in the city.

Q.   When did you get to Oahu?
AYAKO UEHARA:   Friday.

Q.   How many times have you been here? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   First time.

Q.   What do you think of it?   Beautiful? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Very windy, blistery.

Q.   Did you expect it? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   More than I expected. 

Q.   What are you looking forward to continue with your strong play for the rest of the week? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   Making good decisions.   And then I need a good rest for my brain, and then make good decisions every time and go on like that. 

Q.   You mentioned club selection.   How much more difficult is that with this wind? 
AYAKO UEHARA:   The trajectory depends and like the wind blows, it takes it away and things like that.   So I need to think about that.   And then draw the ball and the fade is completely different with the wind, hitting the ball.
