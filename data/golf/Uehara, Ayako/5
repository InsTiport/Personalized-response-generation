Q. Nice round.
AYAKO UEHARA: Thank you.
Q. How did it go out there today?
AYAKO UEHARA: Today it was so tough, but I had bogey-free, which is very, very good.
Q. What made it tough?  What was so challenging today?
AYAKO UEHARA: Actually, the greens were so fast and they're firm, so I needed to play very smart golf.  Actually I did a good job.
Q. You did an awesome -- it might be a top 5, depending on how these last players finish.
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
Q. Was it your goal this week to get a top 5, and do you feel satisfied with your finish?
AYAKO UEHARA: I think ANA I was top 7 or something like that, so I wanted more better than ANA, so that's my goal this week.  Maybe I have a chance, which is good.  And also, right now money rank, some Asian events didn't even in yet, but maybe this week's results will help, which is very good, too.
Q. We want to see you in those Asian events later this year.
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
Q. I know you talked about playing smart and working on your putting.  Again, what clicked for you at the beginning of the week because you played pretty steady golf.  What was it, a mental change?  Was it just technical?
AYAKO UEHARA: Maybe a little bit like improve putting because I was keep doing drills, so maybe that's helped, also.  Also this week, I had Bob reading greens better, so that's also helped, too.
Q. Does he usually read the greens for you?
AYAKO UEHARA: Usually I'm reading myself and then he.  But this time I changed a little bit, and I had a good result.
Q. How important to you is it to reevaluate some of your techniques during the year?  I know you played very consistent, that you realized you needed to change something.  What kind of got you motivated to change the game plan this week?
AYAKO UEHARA: Actually I didn't change the game plan, but I was working on putting drills, so maybe -- I don't know what it's called.  So I did a process, and then --
Q. Results?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
Q. So you've made small changes and you saw a huge result at the end of this week?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
Q. Do you feel pretty good about how you finished this week?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yes.
Q. You have Evian next; what are you going to do in the next week?
AYAKO UEHARA: Next week I will go to Los Angeles, see my coach, and then Evian.
