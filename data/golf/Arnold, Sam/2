 Q. How do you feel about your round today?
 SAM ARNOLD: I shot 81 and it's almost as good a round as at Oakland Hills where I shot 80 the first round. I was hitting the ball pretty good throughout the practice round and then all of a sudden on the first tee it's a little different when you get inside the ropes playing for the real deal. 
 But I had a good time. I had a great pairing. Johan and Jeff are good guys, feel comfortable being a club pro. Wish I struck the ball a little better. The short game was good, couldn't get off the tee really.

 Q. How does this compare to the two previous PGA championships?
 SAM ARNOLD: You know, it seems like each year it gets better and better. The golf course today was challenging. It was fun to play. I just wish I would have played better.

 Q. What are you going to do to get ready for tomorrow?
 SAM ARNOLD: Just go get some dinner and sleep on it. I think it's more of a mental thing rather than a physical thing. So I'm just going to do the same routine, wake up and just try to get more comfortable on the first tee tomorrow.
