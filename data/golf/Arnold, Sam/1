  Q. I just have to ask you about your overall experience of the week:  
 SAM ARNOLD: It was disappointing, though. I had high expectations coming into this PGA Championship, and I just didn't perform well. I shot 77 today and I left a couple out there, but yesterday's round was pretty disappointing, just because I just wasn't trusting my swing.   
  
  Q. And what did you learn from this experience and what will you take back with you in your job as a club pro?   
 SAM ARNOLD: You know, this past week has been fantastic. I got to play a few holes with Stewart Cink and Zach Johnson, and the neat thing about that was Butch Harmon in the group, and Butch waAs great. You know, this morning, he remembered who I was and he said hi and just the little things that make these players the best in the world, you might be able to take something back to your course and help out other players.
