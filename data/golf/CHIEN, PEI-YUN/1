Q. What about your game was so good that got you to that 5 under score.
PEI-YUN CHIEN: Today, actually, my neck is not very comfortable.  So I'm very focused on my every shot, and through shot routine, I do very well.  Yeah.
Q. When you birdied the holes that you birdied, did you hit the ball close, or did you make putts that were long?
PEI-YUN CHIEN: Number 3, I made the bunker shot, amazing shot, and I holed it.  I know I have the chance to play under par today, so I'm pretty focused today.
Q. That's the best round of the day so far.  Did you feel that you were going to play well when you were warming up, or did you reach a certain point in your round where you said, I'm playing pretty well today.  I think I can do something here.
PEI-YUN CHIEN: When I warm up, I just feel something I cannot control.  So the only thing I can control is, like, shot today.  So I just focus cut shot and focus my carry landing.
And today, I didn't rely on my line to putting, because I think if I rely on, I feel not very comfortable.  I can't putt very free.  So my putting is pretty good today, because just putt my feeling.
Q. Your neck, is that something that you've hurt before, or did you just feel that today?
PEI-YUN CHIEN: I think just because the pillow's pretty soft in the hotel, so it's just not work.
Q. Do you think getting an earlier start today was a bit of an advantage than yesterday with the course and all?
PEI-YUN CHIEN: Yes, yesterday, pretty hard afternoon.  Pretty windy.  The club, you need to like 20 yards more or 20 yards short.  And today, morning, not a lot of wind.  Pretty consistent in my shot today.
