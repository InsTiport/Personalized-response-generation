Q.   Couple too many back, but you get an early start, make some birdies early, you never know?
MIKKOILONEN:   I think I'm in a good position, not too far back.   It depends on what Rory does on the last couple of holes.   You know, I'm happy with it, to turn it around.   I was 2 over after 2, double on the second.   To turn it around there was big for me.

Q.   The big thing really is that everybody seemed to start making birdies on the back.   It's bunched up right now.   It really is.   It's really noisy. 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Playing with Rickie, obviously he's a favorite over here, and I think it's been about 13 years for me that I've heard such roars and that was playing with Tiger at the Masters. 

Q.   You are a pretty tall guy, you have played with Rory.   He's only about 5'9".   Rickie isn't much taller.   It's amazing how far these little guys hit a ball right now, isn't it?
MIKKOILONEN:   Well, you know, you expect nothing, nothing less.   They are thick guys, their swings are there and they can just pound it every shot.   I'm not that old, but I'm still ten or whatever years older.   I feel like I'm a little bit behind.   I need to swing it a little bit better to keep up with them. 

Q.   Go out there and have some fun tomorrow.   Who knows what's going to happen?
MIKKOILONEN:   Hope for the best. 

Q.   First off, you know you are in a fantastic position heading into tomorrow.   The golf course is soft.   What is going to be the strategy?
MIKKOILONEN:   I've got to hit more fairways.   I missed a couple of fairways today where I have been hitting good drivers earlier in the week.   The thing for me with the scoring that I've had is I've putted very consistently.   I've had the speed all the way, all through the three days and that's really the key for me that I keep relaxed on the greens and I feel the speed.
