 Q.   Are you very, very proud of your performance across the whole of this week, wire‑to‑wire?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Wire‑to‑wire, it was very much Martin Kaymer‑inspired win.   I sent a message to him last week that I really enjoyed watching golf.   I very rarely enjoy watching golf; I would rather play golf, but Martin's win inspired me.   It was nice to keep that lead all the way.  
   
 Q.   Dare I say there was the similarity, not only leading but the way you held yourself and you seemed to be walking tall and very assured.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   I made sure that I paced myself good and I'm not too quick with things and keep my head up no matter what happens, and I kept on doing the same thing all the time, tried to hit the fairway.   Hit a lot of greens today and kept okay pace with my putting.  
   
 Q.   You've won in Scandinavia, but this is something special, as well, isn't it?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   This is slightly bigger.   I look back on the 18th green and I can't believe how many people there were.   It's nice to see.   It was a very humble moment.
