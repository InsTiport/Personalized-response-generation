Q. Your thoughts on 66?
MIKKO ILONEN: It was a perfect start.  Played some of my best golf on the front nine.  Sort of lost my rhythm a little bit there halfway, but came back strong there.  Made two birdies, 16, 18, which was nice.  Continue the trend from the weekend at the Dunhill.
Q. Were you eager to get underway here, knowing that the game is coming together?
MIKKO ILONEN: No, I was actually complaining to my wife, was it Monday night, I was complaining a little bit my feel with the swing.  She said just go out and practice it.  But I sort of had a good idea what to do on Tuesday and Wednesday to get back on track.  After a links week, it's always a little different to go to a normal golf course.
It's a similar temperature.  I'm wearing exactly the same clothes as last week, which helps, so somewhat used to it.
Q. Does it help when you have an eagle early in the round, boosting the confidence?
MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, second hole, I couldn't hit any closer than that from 220 out.  Hit a 3-wood to 20 feet and made it.  I actually left a lot of putts out there, so I missed quite a few nice chances.  The greens are absolutely perfect.  So you know when it's your own fault, and it was my own fault to miss those putts.
Q. Is there a determination to finish the year in style?
MIKKO ILONEN: Of course.  I've still got work to do to get to Dubai.  I'm pretty safe for Turkey.  Not quite sure about Nedbank.  As of now, I will be in for Nedbank and obviously the goal is to finish strong and be as high as possible in the Order of Merit.
