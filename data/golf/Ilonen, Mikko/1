MIKKO ILONEN: I think I've had a 64 or a 65, but today I had such a fast start that I had to back it up, and the remaining holes, and I'm glad that I was able to do that.   
 Q.  Let's talk about your start, 7-under the first nine holes.  What was the key?  
MIKKO ILONEN: Well, I guess the key, really the key, was to get a bonus on 17.  I got off to a quick start, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle, 12, 13 -- no, 11, 14, and then I holed a bunker shot on 17, and 18 was really an easy hole playing down off the left because you could almost drive the green and it was a 2-putt.   
 Q.  How extra special is a 63 around St. Andrews?  
MIKKO ILONEN: Well, I've played here so many times.  In the 90s we played here as an amateur and I always found it really frustrating if you don't get it going, and today, I felt like with that start, I really need to keep this going.  Really happy that I was able to do it.   
 Q.  Nice knowing you've got Carnoustie out of the way?  
MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, I said that yesterday.  When we had that wind, I thought, even after our round, I said, I'm glad that we had Carnoustie in that wind because I think it's somewhat clear what you need to do there.  These two courses, the two other courses, when it gets that windy, you're hitting it so wide sometimes.
