   MIKKO ILONEN: I had some nervous anticipation when I woke up. I was looking forward to this day. I thought it was going to be a good day. I wanted to play with Markus because I've never seen him miss a fairway and I've only seen him miss one now! It was a good pair. We both played well and it was a good mix. We only had one double birdie on the tenth - the other times one of us stepped in with the birdie. Three points is good for the start of the event. It was good to see Justin and Olly and good company and good sportsmanship.
