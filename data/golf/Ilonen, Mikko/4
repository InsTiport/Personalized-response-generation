Q. How pleased are you with the round today?
MIKKO ILONEN: I would have taken it before the round, so pretty pleased with the score.  Pretty much the same as yesterday.  The swing is not there.  I'm not feeling it and I'm hitting it pretty much all over the planet, but somehow getting the score together.
Okay, it was a bit more up-and-down today.  There's some bogeys and doubles in there, but also made some birdies and one eagle, which was good, on the end of the round.
Q. That eagle, the chip-in on 16.
MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, it was a pretty straightforward chip, really.  It was a 54.  Hit a really poor tee shot, middle of the fairway, but it was a long way back.  I hit a 3-wood to just the edge of the green and chipped it in from ten, 12 metres.  A nice little bonus.
Q. As you said, if you're not swinging well but scoring well, it must be positive going into the weekend in this position?
MIKKO ILONEN: Well, yeah, as long as I can get something going with my swing; I felt better today before the round.  I hit some decent shots on the range, and not that it matters, really.  It's just a warm up.  I felt a little more positive today on the course, and so overall it was a better day today than yesterday, even though I shot 64 yesterday.
