Q. Birdies are difficult to come by on this golf course but you've had 11 in two-round total of 5-under.  What's been the secret of success so far?
MIKKO ILONEN: My long putting has been really on.  Had a couple weeks off after Sweden, we worked on it with my coach, and it definitely seems like it's coming back where it should be.  Last week, showing some signs and today.
Q. Explain 17, the third shot.
MIKKO ILONEN: That was courtesy of Slatts, really.  He found the ball and he stepped on it so I could get maybe a little better lie.  Dropped it in the rough and just hacked it out and got really lucky with the third one and rolled nicely to about, what, three feet.  I take that four any day.  I hope I don't have to do it again this week.
Q. Give us a feel for how the golf course has been set up today and is playing compared to yesterday.
MIKKO ILONEN: It's very similar.  The wind is pretty much the same direction.  It keeps flicking on a few holes a different direction but it's very similar to yesterday.  I feel like whatever changes there's been, it's made the golf course slightly easier.  It's made it better, more playable.  They have taken some of the bushes out.  Better views off the tees on 4 and 5.
They are all good changes and it's playing -- as we see, the wind is up, but the wind direction is good for the course.  It's not playing ridiculously hard.
