 Q. Some good scoring from you. 
 MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, I made a nice come back again today. I sort of had my normal day at Kingsbarns. I never seem to get it around this golf course normally. Now I shoot a decent score, 70. 2-under, it was pretty good for me. 
 I had an easy start. Played really good in the beginning and then all of a sudden whacked three times and was 2-over. Then I made 4-under coming back in on those downwind holes. 
 Overall I'm really happy to get it under par again, because I was 2-over.

 Q. And you're right in contention. 
 MIKKO ILONEN: Exactly. I believe two shots behind, it's a good spot to be. 

 Q. Look forward to tomorrow then? 
 MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, definitely. Old Course, I have some good memories there. My memory is really good, but it's short, so I have to think about the Friday. 

 Q. You need a good week, don't you, for Race to Dubai. 
 MIKKO ILONEN: And I want to have all of the weeks good weeks, but now my scoring is a little better than the last 24 months.
