  MIKKO ILONEN:   2‑up in the end, it could have gone either way.   There was some turning points in there in the match.   For me it felt like making the putts on 8 and 9 was crucial.   And then Victor actually made a couple mistakes.   I think he missed that par on 16 which gave me a little bit of cushion but then I had to make a miracle safe to tie that hole.   Could have gone either way but I felt pretty confident it was going to be me in the end.

Q.   How much pressure do you feel when it's win or go home? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   A little bit.   It's a different kind of pressure obviously because you play for that one particular hole at a time and you try to go one shot at a time, which is the same thing as we do in stroke play.   But it's slightly different.   But I haven't felt as nervous maybe as I've been in the past in the bigger tournaments. 

Q.   Fascinating match, what was it like to play in?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Whenever you go 18 holes in match play, it's going to be good for all of us.   It felt like it could have gone either way and lucky to come out on top in the end.   You know, the goal was obviously to play all week and we're there.   So now we just have to keep pushing.

Q.   What were the key moments in the match for you? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Probably making a couple of crucial short putts on No. 8 and 9 and 10.   Made a birdie on 10 which I was 1‑up, all‑square, 1‑up, all‑square.   So it was up and down.   As I said it could have gone Victor's way, as well.   But he maybe made one more mistake than I did. 

Q.   And your thoughts now on the semifinal, potentially two matches to play tomorrow? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Well, you know, take it one shot, one hole at a time really.   Don't even know who I'm playing, so we'll see.
