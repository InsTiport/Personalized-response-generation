Q.   What are your thoughts on 6‑under to start? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   That's a good start.   I was playing well yesterday in the Pro‑Am, shot 3‑under.   I was happy with that.   But to double that to 6‑under is even better, so very happy. 

Q.   Never know entirely what to see from the first round of a competitive season?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, and this has been a tough battling ground for me.   It's been sort of hard to get going on that golf course and it's probably my best round. 

Q.   And this is because of experience or getting used to playing here? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   I think maybe the swing and the feel of the swing is changing a little bit.   So some of the views off the tees, they actually feel a little bit easier as in the past.   Maybe there's been a little bit of improvement in my golf.   So makes it a little easier.

Q.   What have you been doing in the off‑season?   Anything golf‑related or put the clubs away? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   We spent a week in Dubai, Jebel Ali Resort, just playing with the kids, played a few holes and hit some balls.   It was good times and there was a good balance.   But before that, four weeks completely off.   We need to take some time off, and December is the time to take it off. 

Q.   What are your thoughts into this new season, given the success of last year? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   I've set my goals really high.   I'm going to try to keep climbing on that World Ranking but I need to post some good scores and good tournaments before I can do that. 

Q.   Setting them high means writing them down and seeing them as a record at the end of the year?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Exactly, and that's what I've been doing the last few seasons, and I've been going the right direction, so I don't see why jinx that.
