 Q.   Graeme McDowell's 18th match in the World Match Play and only three people have beat him including you.   How does that feel?  
MIKKO ILONEN:   Good.   I did tell people yesterday that I think I have a good chance winning this match.   Yesterday and the day before yesterday, I started feeling a little bit better with my game, and I felt quite comfortable on the greens.   
Other than a couple of long putts I completely mis‑hit yesterday, so I knew if I just gave myself chances, there's plenty of birdies out there and I just need to make a couple more.   
   
 Q.   Having lost yesterday, seemed like you were intent on getting off to a fast start.   What was going through your mind, 5‑under on the front nine?  
MIKKO ILONEN:   I knew I needed to get off to a fast start.   I knew Graeme was going to come at me hard, and he did.   I needed to keep him making birdies.   I needed to avoid mistakes and when I get a good birdie chance I need to make it like I did on 17.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations, your first win of the tournament, you must be pleased particularly knowing what a strong match‑play record your opponent had?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, definitely.   I thought I had a good chance to win this match, if I keep playing like I did yesterday.   
I started off strong yesterday did exactly the same thing today, 5‑under on the front.   So I figured that Graeme is going to come at me on the back nine, and he did.
