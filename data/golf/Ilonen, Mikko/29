Q.   Talk about battling the elements? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, the winds got up a little bit today, which I expected.   I'm not expecting to have three calm days in Qatar.   It made it a bit more interesting.   It was a little‑‑ a few shots tougher than it's been the last few days.

Q.   And yet you got off to such a tremendous start?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, I had three birdies in the first four holes‑‑ made two, and it was a good start but slowed down after that.   I played really good, gave myself a lot of chances. 

Q.   Do you feel that you really do have to make headway on the front nine? 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, it would be good to be a couple under, yeah, but you know, there's some birdie holes on the early back nine, 10 to about 14, and 16, 17, 18, they are all birdieable holes.   Obviously today was a few tougher pins that we've seen. 

Q.   And still in that lovely position?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, I'm not too far back.   We'll see how Rafa comes the last couple of holes and hopefully not too far back.
