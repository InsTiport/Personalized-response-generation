Q. Thoughts on the day?
MIKKO ILONEN: It's a bit of a surprise to be honest.  I wasn't feeling that great this morning, and in the warm up, hitting a few balls on the range, it didn't feel good.  Then went out there and just started dropping putts from everywhere, really.  In the beginning, they were for pars, and then when I had a few chances, I made some birdies.
And pretty strong finish.  I actually hit a couple of really good shots coming in.  It got better as the sun went higher.
Q. So would you say the patience paid off for you today?
MIKKO ILONEN: Yeah, I stayed calm.  I knew in the beginning that it's not going to be easy.  Just keep your head down and keep going, and maybe I get a couple of chances.
Q. You weren't expecting to be in short sleeves in Newcastle, were you?
MIKKO ILONEN: Certainly not.  I had my Long Johns ready this morning, and luckily I didn't put them on.
Q. How are the crowds out there?
MIKKO ILONEN: Seems like there's a lot of people.  That's great.  It looks like it's going to be a fantastic week.
