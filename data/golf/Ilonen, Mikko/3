Q. You must be pleased with today's round of 68?
MIKKO ILONEN: I would have taken it this morning, definitely.  Bogey-free, I can't even remember when I was bogey-free.  Not too many birdies.  I obviously left a few shots on the par 5s.  But it was better than I've been playing recent weeks.
Q. You talked about leaving a few shots but what pleased you most about today's round?
MIKKO ILONEN: My drives on No. 3 and No. 10.  They were weird ones.  But you've got to take the positives out of the round and they were the biggest moments for me.
Q. It's a course you've played many times before how has it changed and how is it playing out there today?
MIKKO ILONEN: It has a lot of grass on it.  I feel like the greens, if anything, they are slightly slower than my memory tells me.  So it's in perfect condition.  There's not a lot of run in the fairways because there's a lot of grass in the fairways, as well.  But we're hoping to see if it firms up a little bit.  I think the conditions this afternoon -- it's going to be low scores out there.
Q. After last season, is it fair to say it would be nice to get off to a good start this year?
MIKKO ILONEN: It's more than fair to say, yeah.  I mean, it was a struggle.  I think it was a good kick in the butt, as well.
