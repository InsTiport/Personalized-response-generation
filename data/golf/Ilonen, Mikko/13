Q.   How tough was it out there this morning?
MIKKO ILONEN:   It was a tough start because it was an early start, first early start of the week really.   I think we were still both sleeping when we started.   There wasn't many birdies out there, so it was a big battle in the end.   We made a couple of putts and in the end it was me.

Q.   Was the putt on 15 key?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, it was a classic matchâ€‘play situation really.   I called it beforehand to my caddie.   I said, it's a good time to make a putt.   You see it so often, the one makes a longer one, the other one misses a shorter one.   It's a big turnaround. 

Q.   Very quick turnaround between now and the final.   Hopefully pick up a few more birdies this afternoon?
MIKKO ILONEN:   I need a lot more birdies this afternoon.   I hope I saved them to the end.
