Q.   Does the first day feel a nice long distance away now?
MIKKO ILONEN:   It does, yeah.   Only one black mark in the card for two days. 
Played bogey free today which was really good.   I'm really pleased.

Q.   Well, you can stress that because this is very good on a day like today.   It's lovely as a spectator, but for all of you out there, it's treacherous. 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, I mean I think it's very interesting for the spectators as well.   They see on the Front 9 everybody's just flicking it to the green and then coming Back 9 we're all over the place.
You know, luckily I kept it somewhat together on the Back 9 and had a couple of lucky breaks and I shot 3‑under on the back.

Q.   How did you do that, when barely anybody else is?
MIKKO ILONEN:   I mean I just‑‑ I knew it was going to be difficult.   My attitude was, you know, just get the ball on the green somehow. 
I had to say‑‑ a couple of times I had to save par from a good substance away.   But then my pitching was spot on as well on a few of the occasions when I needed to.   So it saved me.

Q.   Is there frustrations when you're making par after par on the Front 9 knowing that that's where you make your chances?
MIKKO ILONEN:   It was, yeah.   I missed a couple of easy birdie chances there.   But somehow I felt really confident today.   I felt a lot better on the golf course today than yesterday. 
The day before that in the pro am I played really good, so I know the game is there.   The shots are not quite there.   But the game face is on, so it's good.

Q.   And you love links golf?
MIKKO ILONEN:   I love it, you know.   And I've been to this course before.   I don't have a lot of memories of it, but I guess they must be good, because it produces some good golf.

Q.   Well done.   Thank you. 
MIKKO ILONEN:   Thank you.
