Q.   What is the verdict then, coming so close. 
MIKKO ILONEN:   I came two short of my target in the regulation.   I thought 64 would do it out right.   66 was good enough for the playoff, but Sergio was a bit better this time. 

Q.   66 was something special, anyway, wasn't it?   You really got it going from early on?
MIKKO ILONEN:   I needed a strong start and I got it to 4‑under through, what, eight holes, and I backed it up with a good ending to the round.   I made three birdies in the last five holes.   You know, I played good golf this week.   I can't be too disappointed.

Q.   And for us as spectators, that was a wonderful playoff.   I don't know if it was a good one to be involved in when you've got these eagle opportunities?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, it was my first one.   You know, it was always going to be like that.     And I was actually expecting that one of us is going to make an eagle.   That's what it's going to take. 
But you know, I hit two poor bunker shots out of that front right trap, one in the regulation and one now in the third playoff hole.   I'm not going to blame anything else for my poor shot.

Q.   Given the nice start to 2014, this is a nice result‑‑
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, of course, I needed a good week here and I need a good week next week just to sort of refine my schedule a little bit, because the target is obviously to get into the Match Play and Doral.   But Match Play first, and we'll see where we are in the World Rankings after this week.
