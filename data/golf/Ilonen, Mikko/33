 Q.   Thoughts on your round?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   This morning, I was thinking 69, 68.   And I managed to do birdies on more difficult holes, like coming into the wind on 7 and 9.   Made birdie on those and I missed a couple of par 5s.   
   
 Q.   Suggests that it's easy and it's only reasonably acceptable rather than terrifically good.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   6‑under is a solid start.   What I was thinking yesterday, you know, I need to get to 20‑under on Sunday.  
So, I'm on the right track.   But I believe there's going to be low scores today, and it already has.   We might see a 10‑under; we'll see.   
   
 Q.   You don't go into many events thinking 20‑under is the target; must be a change in attitude.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   The golf course doesn't have any defence right now with this weather.   It's playing firm, it's playing short.   It's in good condition.   And it's pretty wide off the tees.   
If you manage to avoid some of the traps out there, you're going to eventually end up with some birdie chances.   And I had two 3‑putts today, so it could be a little better.   
   
 Q.   Still on top of your game?  
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, even though I shot 10‑over last week, it didn't matter at all.   Hitting the ball fine.   There's a couple of shots that I need to work on.   Coming into the wind, I don't feel that comfortable, but just hit a few balls on the range today.   Hopefully get a little better.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like this is a release after Paris.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, I definitely enjoy it here.   These two weeks, this week and next week, two weeks with this weather in Scotland, go enjoy it, it's the best.
