Q.   I take it you're a happy man, played some superb golf out there?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, we mixed it up really good with ThorbjÃ¸rn.   He made a few birdies, I made a few birdies here and there, the timing of the birdies were good.   Okay, we got a little cold in the end but it's a point and it doesn't matter how it comes. 
It's good that we got the practice, all 18 today.   I actually wanted to play 18 yesterday, the 18th hole just in case.   Now I've seen it again.   All in all, a good day.   We can definitely play better than what we did today.

Q.   A match you were always leading but I guess there's always tension when it's coming down the last like this?
MIKKO ILONEN:   Definitely, we both thought we hit good putts there on the last, and we didn't make it.   It's the same thing on 17, I hit a great putt there; didn't go in, slow motion lipout there.   It could have been either way, but the small things makes the difference in match play.
