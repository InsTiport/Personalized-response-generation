 Q.   Tell me how thrilling that finish was after the joys of last week.  
MIKKO ILONEN:   Well, it was expected.   I felt yesterday that I started to drive the ball better again.   It was exactly the same story as last week.   Started slow and then gradually got better as the week went on.   Got off to a good, flying start today, and I thought I have to take advantage.  
   
 Q.   Which means huge satisfaction or a bit of regret that you didn't get things going sooner?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   It was good satisfaction.   I'm not too disappointed.   I had to work hard on Friday to make the cut, so to finish how I did today is good.   
   
 Q.   Presumably after last week you came in here with abundant confidence.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, I was expecting.   Actually Thursday I played really good.   Just didn't get the good score and Friday was just a typical day for me, got it out of the way, made the cut and the weekend was good.  
   
 Q.   What do you reckon for the outcome, one stroke off the lead, will you be hanging around?  
MIKKO ILONEN:   I'll pack things up and I'll go and play with my son on the range.   
   
 Q.   But either way, a lovely for the night.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, the last two weeks has been wonderful.   The whole idea was first four weeks for me was to get rid of the rust and I think I've managed to do that.  
   
 Q.   Bodes well for 2014 and bodes well for World Rankings, as well.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Yeah, exactly, I'll be in for the Match Play now, plan for that trip so to speak.
