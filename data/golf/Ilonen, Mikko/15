  MIKKO ILONEN:   It was a long day for the spectators, for the organizers, and playing in that wind in the afternoon, I think I'm going to feel it tonight at some point but not yet.   
   
 Q.   What are your emotions right now?   You've just beaten one of the world's best players.   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Well, I see Henrik as one of the world's top players obviously but I see him as my friend.   He didn't intimidate me at all.   We've played so much golf together over the years, so I felt quite comfortable playing with him.  
   
 Q.   Does that make it feel a bit more special to beat him?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   No, it could have gone either way really.   I had a better afternoon than he did.   Tomorrow morning we play, might go the other way.   But we were obviously playing for the trophy as hard as we could, and I came out on top.   
   
 Q.   This must go down as the year of your career so far, would it be fair to say with this victory and winning The Irish Open?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   Definitely, by far.   Obviously last year was a good for me and 2007 was a good year.   I've had a few of them but if you look at all the World Rankings and Money List and the tournaments‑‑ obviously this is on top.   
   
 Q.   This takes you into the world's top 40 which is a good time of the year to do that, you can start planning for a global schedule in many respects and first Masters as a professional, that sort of thing.   A lot comes with this, doesn't it?   
MIKKO ILONEN:   A lot comes with it.   It's been a goal of mine to be able to get a schedule that you can pick and choose wherever you want to play.   I can do that now, so it's a good situation.   I can play the bigger tournaments.   I've been driving for that for the last couple years.   It's good.
