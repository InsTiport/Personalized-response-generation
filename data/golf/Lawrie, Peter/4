 Q.   Two birdies to finish your round yesterday; got your reward today.   
PETER LAWRIE:   Yes, I did.   You know, got out there, played nicely, could have been a whole lot better starting out.   Missed a few chances and then had those three birdies in a row.   
Then that poor tee shot off 10 into the bunker and another poor tee shot on 11, but got myself back together, three birdies in a row and finished with a nice birdie at the last.  
   
 Q.   You're very much under the radar this week, a lot of the bigger names didn't make the cut; you did.   A lot of attention now will switch to both yourself and you, and you're in the hunt on 6‑under par.   
PETER LAWRIE:   You know, I started out the start of the day, after making the cut, just tried to crawl my way up the leaderboard and give Shane sort of support in the Irish backing.   
Yes, unfortunately for the tournament we have lost a couple of the big names but there's a lot of golf to be played here and hopefully very exciting.  
   
 Q.   You bogeyed 10 and 11, a bit of momentum stopper, but you got three birdies in a row again, very pleasing, I'm sure.   
PETER LAWRIE:   Yes, I birdied 12, 13, 14.   Good shot into 12 there, and you can pretty much drive 13, and a nice birdie on 14, so I was very happy with that.  
   
 Q.   And then a birdie on 18 to finish, so nice to finish on a high?  
PETER LAWRIE:   It is, yeah.   Always makes it a little bit sweeter, so just delighted to finish with a birdie and get to 6‑under, bit of a lie‑in tomorrow morning.   
   
 Q.   Another good round tomorrow and you could very much be in the hunt.   
PETER LAWRIE:   Yeah, all depends on what happens this afternoon with the weather really.   I can't see really 6‑under‑‑ you throw another 6‑under, it's 12; I personally think 15‑ to 18‑under will win it, but you never know.
