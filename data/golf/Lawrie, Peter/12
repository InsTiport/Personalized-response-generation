Q.   Even par, third round of the tournament, tell us how please are you with the even par round and how tough was it to play a par round?
PETER LAWRIE:   I was very happy after nine holes, a little bit sad after 18.   I played lovely on the front nine.   Pretty good on the back nine.   One or two little sort of little mistakes.   Just didn't hole any putts on the back nine, and it's playing tough. 

Q.   Hitting fairways especially greens seems to be difficult and we've seen a lot of doubleâ€‘bogeys; you didn't have any. 
PETER LAWRIE:   Well, touch wood, yeah, so far.   I struck the ball lovely off the tee and my iron play has been good and I've hit a lot of greens in regulation.   It's just a little bit disappointing with not holing enough putts. 
Playing with Luke who is such a good putter, he really is, and you see him holding a couple and you want to hold them, as well.   But we'll wait and see what tomorrow brings.

Q.   Looking to tomorrow's final round, how do you feel?
PETER LAWRIE:   Well, four back, give it a go tomorrow.   If I can get off to a hot start, a couple under after nine, and then hopefully press on for the back nine; but tomorrow will be another day.
