Q.   Being here for the weekend must give you a lot of satisfaction?
PETER LAWRIE:   It's a difficult golf course, it really is, especially the conditions we got it in.   Hopefully get out there tomorrow, get a decent score under my belt in the morning time and hopefully I'll put myself in a position for Sunday.

Q.   What in particular have you found difficult over the last two days?
PETER LAWRIE:   Just with the wind and the rain, you know what I mean, that was mainly it.   Yesterday was the same, and this afternoon, the same.   So you know, it's just been difficult really. 

Q.   And obviously now, nice for you to be able to look forward to the weekend and fly the flag for the home challenge?
PETER LAWRIE:   You know there's a lot of other guys ahead of me.   Shane is up the leaderboard, which is great, for the Irish crowds and hopefully Rory can make the cut, and yeah, we'll have a nice weekend here.
