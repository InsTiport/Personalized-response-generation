  PETER LAWRIE:   Haven't hit my irons this close in a long time, drove the ball nicely and holed one or two putts but nothing major.   Very happy to be starting with 4â€‘under.   
   
 Q.   And that's a good score around here, isn't it?  
PETER LAWRIE:   Very good score, yeah.   I'm very happy with it, especially out early in the morning.   Normally it's a bit tougher but today it was quite warm.   So the ball was flying, so you know, very happy.   
   
 Q.   Out early in the morning means that you saw the rain shower?   
PETER LAWRIE:   Rain shower here, I've never seen the likes of it this morning.   On the way up to the golf course you could hardly see.   I thought, there's no way we were going to start on time but lo and behold, we did.   
   
 Q.   Has it made any difference to the course or just where you're walking to get to the course?   
PETER LAWRIE:   The course is playing a bit softer, fairways are not running out at all so it's playing quite long.   It's not really up my alley but the greens are a little bit softer than they have been.   
So you could hit your kind of iron shots straight at the flag, and if you hit them the right distance, they were going to go close.  
   
 Q.   Take it this is a lovely continuation of last week in Hong Kong having made sure of your place here?  
PETER LAWRIE:   Yeah, I played lovely last week and came here with a bit of confidence and just again, if I can get the driver going this week and hit a few fairways and get it out there a little bit, you know never know.   
   
 Q.   Your playing partner has done nicely?  
PETER LAWRIE:   Yeah, myself and Marc get on very well and he's comfortable with my sort of company on the golf course and I'm comfortable with his.   We really enjoyed it this morning.
