 Q.   What did you think of the course conditions for today?  
HALE IRWIN:   Well, it was a golf course we have certainly haven't seen in the last few days.   The wind direction was different than what I've seen on a course that was blowing very gusty out there.   So some of the tees were forward to accommodate that.   We haven't seen that the last few days.   
Of course, the more interesting hole locations, it was ‑‑ I'm happy to get in with even par, let's put it that way.   Not that I couldn't have shot better, I could have.   But at the same time it was a different golf course than I had seen.  
   
 Q.   You came away with par on number 10.   You conquered that one.   
HALE IRWIN:   Well, that, actually, I had a good chance for birdie, I was just off the left part of the green there and I hit a very poor chip and ended up making a five.   
But that hole was playing downwind today, so it was a little bit more forgiving than what we have seen.   And you just got to be very careful with where you leave yourself for your third there.   Even though there will be a lot of players that can go for that green in two, and some of them might, if they don't do it correctly then they're faced with a pretty impossible task.
