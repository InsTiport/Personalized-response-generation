   HALE IRWIN:  Very disappointed in this tournament.  Of all tournaments, this one.   
  
  Q.  How did you play today?   
 HALE IRWIN:  I didn't like it, let's put it that way.   
  
  Q.  What do you think will be your next tournament?   
 HALE IRWIN:  3M, perhaps, Minneapolis, we'll see.  In three weeks we'll see how I feel.  If I don't feel right, maybe I won't do it.   
 I've been like this for a long time, so -- it's a new path I'm on and I've got to get off of it.  Okay.
