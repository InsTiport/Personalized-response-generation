 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
HALE IRWIN:   Hopefully it will set up for a better day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What happened on 4?  
HALE IRWIN:   I just pulled it.   I hit up on top of the bank and it rolled down in the water and went to the drop zone and hit it on and 3‑putted for a six.   It's pretty easy to do when you stop and think about it.   Especially the way I'm putting.   
So I went with a new putter today, a different putter, I should say, one that's a little heavier, one that would give me a little better roll on the greens.   But that didn't happen either.   
So I think I'll go back to the old one and take the lead tape I put on it off and make it lighter and see what happens.   Because right now I'm looking for anything.   Anybody got any suggestions?   You're the birthday boy, you got any suggestions.  
   
 Q.   Claw grip?  
HALE IRWIN:   Oh, I tried that too.  
   
 Q.   First hole a 5‑footer and third hole about a 3‑footer?  
HALE IRWIN:   First hole was about eight feet and second hole or the third hole was about three feet.   
Even on four for a ‑‑ four was another short putt.   So really in the space of 18 or 9, the 9th hole yesterday, my 18th, and the third and fourth holes, I missed three putts that were three feet or less.   So just take that away and I got a pretty good score.
