Q.  How do you feel about this venue for this Senior PGA Championship?
HALE IRWIN:  Well, I think it's great.  The course is in wonderful condition.  It's a good venue.  I think simply because it's a great golf course.  There's no one hole that's like another, which I think is a good thing to have for any golf course.  But Laurel Valley has hosted Major Championship venues in the past or events in the past and continues to do so.
Q.  Do you think the weather is going to play a factor as far as how people approach or play the course?
HALE IRWIN:  I think it will.
Q.  As far as the greens softening up?
HALE IRWIN:  It's already soft.  It could get softer, but maybe so the rain it's the cool weather.  It doesn't seem to affect some, but for many of us it does, so it probably cold more than the wet.
