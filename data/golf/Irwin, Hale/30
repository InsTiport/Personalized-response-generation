  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 HALE IRWIN:  I didn't figure it out.  I'm still wondering what's going on.  I think the biggest difference is certainly the wind is not blowing at quite the pace it did yesterday when we played.  But I can't say a whole lot good about my game right now except I seem to be putting pretty well.  But I just can't get to the fairways or the greens.  But other than that I'm doing okay.  But yesterday was a poorly played round.  And today wasn't much better.  I just, I had a few more opportunities and I putted great.   
  
  Q.  General consensus is stay away from the sand.   
 HALE IRWIN:  Well, I think every player in this field is going to tell you the sand is exactly that.  And I never played in an event where sand was like this.  Where you're encouraged to take an unplayable lie before you can even come close to finding your ball is I think a big challenge.   
  
  Q.  Is this course harder on guys than other courses, in other words if you go long on one hole, it's --   
 HALE IRWIN:  Oh, if you go long here there may not be an escape.  You're in jail.  We don't have bunkers that are like this.  But the sand is so deep in places that you literally cannot find your ball.  And if you can't find your ball it's real close to where we have to play.  It's very severe.   
  
  Q.  Unfair?   
 HALE IRWIN:  I said it was severe.  Fair, unfair, that's a fine line.
