 Q.   Can you discuss your round today, the seven birdies and the constant improvement over the last few days and how you've adapted to the course.   
SANDY LYLE:   Well what have I done differently?   Not a lot.   First round I played really well, but I putted very poorly.   And I had a new putter just last week and it wasn't earning its brownie points.   And now‑‑ so I only missed like two greens in regulation, so I'm, I was hitting the ball well, even though it was very windy the first two day.   So the first round score didn't really reflect the way I was playing.   
Yesterday I had a terrible start, like three or four shots dropped at the first four holes.   So I had a really up‑and‑down ferry ride, like Disney World, as you would say.   
But today I played solid golf and my putter has been working a lot better.   And that's helped an awful lot in the game, just holing some putts, because I've not done that for quite awhile just now.   
So hopefully that will be, things will be better.   But as you see, it's probably as big a putter you can buy right now, as far as the size of the putter, but it seems to be earning its keep right now.  
   
 Q.   How are you able to adapt to the weather, this morning, 60s, windy, raining?  
SANDY LYLE:   I come from Europe, Scotland.   We're pretty used to cold, cold, wind, snow, we have had the whole lot.   And as it is now I never believed it was going to be up in the 80s, but it is.
