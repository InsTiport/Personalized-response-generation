 Q.  Talking about his round. 

 SANDY LYLE:  It was a good come back.  I made three birdies at Amen Corner.  Gave it a little hope.  Had a good drive at 18.  20 feet off the green.  I didn't play badly yesterday.  I probably played better yesterday as far as contact. 

 I'm happy with it so far.  It was a good showing.
