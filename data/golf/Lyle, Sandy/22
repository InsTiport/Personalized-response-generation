Q.   Did you hit the ball better or just a combination of better weather?
SANDY LYLE:   Well, considering only about three holes into my second round this week that I was at 6‑over, looking like I'm going to have a hard job even to make the cut.   And I turned it around.   And what I've done differently?   Nothing. 
I've got a new putter out this week, which didn't work very well the first day, and then the last few days it's done its work a lot better.   I'm making putts.   I'm making a lot of putts.

Q.   How many birdies and eagles?
SANDY LYLE:   I had quite a few birdies today.   I had one eagle today.

Q.   Tell me about the eagle on 9. 
SANDY LYLE:   Good drive at the corner and then ‑‑ right at the corner ‑‑ and then I had a 4‑iron from about 230.   And I hit it about six feet behind the back of the hole.   Nearly went in.   It actually hit the edge of the hole.   And I made the putt there. 
So a lot of birdies, two bogeys in the last three holes just kind of ruined it.

Q.   Did you know where you were?
SANDY LYLE:   Well, I was well aware of my situation.   I really felt like I had to hold on to where I was, at least.   But it was a bit of a disappointment to not finish well.
