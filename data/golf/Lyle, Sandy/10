 Q.  How about your round today?  SANDY LYLE: Well, yes, that was promising start and then had a lot of trouble making some putts early on.  So, I was going the wrong direction. And then I had a little chip-in at 9, which was for an eagle, just off the back of the green.  It was a short chip, but it was still a chip shot.  That kind of helped things along. Then I started down the 10th hole and made bogey with a wedge in my hand, which is like going the other way. And I wasn't really making any putts, but a strong finish, obviously, a tap-in at 18. About a 10-footer at 17. Missed a 4-footer at 16 for birdie.  The wind caught it, unfortunately, at the time I hit the putt. And I made a birdie at 15. So a strong finish, 71, I'll take that after the start of the day.   Q.  Conditions today as opposed to yesterday?  SANDY LYLE: Oh, a lot warmer.  I think we have had the better half of the draw, for sure.  I think yesterday in the morning most of the players were suffering from froze bite and that kind of thing early on.  So I wasn't until late in the afternoon and it still was pretty cold then.  So, I think that we have had the better half of the draw so far.
