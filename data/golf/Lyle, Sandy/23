SANDY LYLE:   First of all, I mean, he's lost his coach just recently due to illness and I think that's been a great motivation for him. 
It's been wonderful for him to pull it off this week.   He's been a great player for many years, but maybe under the radar a little bit.   And he hasn't, if you look at his record, he hasn't achieved a massive amount of tournament wins, but he's always been a good player. 
And I think that since he's turned 50 he's kept himself pretty healthy and he's still a very powerful player.   And he did try and qualify for the Champions Tour last year, but he was on the borderline between you get in, you don't get in.   And he didn't get in many tournaments.   So I think he felt a little P'd off about that that he didn't get a chance to play when he thought he was in. 
So I think this week he's come out there with a vengeance.   He wants to prove to himself that he's capable of playing this TOUR and he came through 100 percent and it's a great achievement.
