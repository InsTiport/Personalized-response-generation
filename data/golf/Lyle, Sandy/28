 Q. That closing birdie was a lovely finish to a great first day...
 SANDY LYLE: Yeah, any time you can finish with a three at Carnoustie is great, and to finish the last three holes in one under is even better. Most people will make three pars at best, so you're picking up a shot at the very least. I made some great putts today, especially on 16 and 17. So overall I'm very happy to be three under par after the first day, because you can be out of the tournament pretty quickly if you start at Carnoustie, especially if the weather's bad.

 Q. What were the conditions like?
 SANDY LYLE: They were benign early on, but the wind picked up a little bit towards the end. It was just a wee breeze, as they say in these parts.

 Q. How did you enjoy playing with Chris Evans and Andrew Strauss?
 SANDY LYLE: It was a lot of fun. We were chatting away all day, and it helped that we all played pretty well. Nick Dougherty was holing everything early on, and I thought he was going to shoot the lights out. He had a few hiccups later on, but overall everyone enjoyed it.

 Q. Do you enjoy playing on the main Tour, and playing well on the main Tour?
 SANDY LYLE: I do, though I don't always play well. I had a disastrous July at The Open, the Scottish Open and the Senior Open. That was a very tough period, and I wasn't a happy camper for a while. But I've made a few drastic swing changes, and my rhythm and timing are now much better. I'm hitting the ball a lot straighter now rather than pulling it left, so we're definitely moving in the right direction and gaining confidence all the time.
