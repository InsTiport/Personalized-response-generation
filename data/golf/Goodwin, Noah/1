Q. Quite a finish.  How was it looking for you, you know, short of the green there, him on.  How were you feeling?
NOAH GOODWIN: Kind of liked the shot.  It was a pretty straightforward bunker shot, but at the end of the day, I just had to put pressure on him and force him to make a putt.
I didn't put myself in the best situation after the shot back there, but it was able to work out in the end.
Q. How did you feel?  Keep the advantage much of the day?
NOAH GOODWIN: Didn't play great.  He putted absolutely amazing today.  We both left things out there that we probably shouldn't have.
I was able to make another bunker shot on 11.
Those were pretty much the two highlights.  I left a lot the key putts out there.  Missed one for birdie on 16 that was about six feet, and a couple others.
But overall, I just kind of kept it going.  Didn't really put myself too far out of it on any holes and just was able to make a lot of pars.
Q. Match play is so different from stroke play.  You have to try to forget and have a really short memory if you miss a putt like that.  How do you accomplish that?
NOAH GOODWIN: Each hole is just a new hole.  You can't let frustration or anything get to you.  Any time you let your emotions take control in match play, your opponent can use that to their advantage and know you might slip up here or there.
Just have to keep moving forward.
