 Q.  Is there anything you're working on in your swing?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Actually my swing has been off and on, and that's kind of why -- I should have been winning throughout the match, but my ball-striking was just not with me today like yesterday, so yeah, I just had to scramble.   
 Q.  What are your misses usually?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Left.   
 Q.  So like for this afternoon, will you hit some balls before and try to work it out, or will you just --  
ELIZABETH MOON: I'll just fake it probably.  I'll hit a few balls before I tee off, but I'm not going to really try to --   
 Q.  When did you start playing?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Since I was six.   
 Q.  And is this your first USGA event?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Yes.  I attempted to qualify but never was successful until this year.   
 Q.  Do you have brothers and sisters?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Yes, I have one younger sister and three younger brothers.   
 Q.  Wow.  And did I hear that you kind of stepped away a little bit from competitive to concentrate on school?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Yes, I did.  Up until 13 I was really good, and then I just kind of -- I didn't play as well, and then that kind of, I guess, was a turning point in my golf career.  I didn't quit, but I just didn't play as much.   
 Q.  It wasn't as much fun?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Yeah.  Since I'm playing bad, it can't be fun when you're playing bad, also.  So I just kind of -- I mean, I practiced but I didn't practice as much as I am this year.  This past year I've been practicing.   
 Q.  Did you miss it when you kind of stepped away?  Did you realize you missed it?  When you stepped away from golf, when you backed off a little bit --  
ELIZABETH MOON: I think so.  I think that the winning feeling I used to have is just -- when I had that little pause, I guess I missed that winning feeling, and then I saw like all of my friends that I used to compete with when I was like 11, 12, and they were like doing great, winning AJGA tournaments and just playing fantastic.   
 Q.  Do you work with somebody?  
ELIZABETH MOON: My dad.   
 Q.  Does he play golf?  
ELIZABETH MOON: He used to.  After I started playing competitively, he stopped playing golf.   
 Q.  Because you were beating him?  I'm just kidding.  Is he here this week?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Yes, he was watching me.  He didn't even watch my last hole.  I guess he was too --   
 Q.  It's hard.  
ELIZABETH MOON: I guess it was too nerve-racking for him.   
 Q.  Who's caddying for you?  
ELIZABETH MOON: He's a volunteer.  He's Mr. Curtis.   
 Q.  He's one of the members, I believe?  
ELIZABETH MOON: I think so.   
 Q.  Has he been helping you a lot?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Well, I didn't have a caddie until the last nine holes of this match.   
 Q.  You did it by yourself?  
ELIZABETH MOON: I did it by myself the entire way.   
 Q.  What happened the last nine holes that you decided that you wanted to get Mr. Curtis?  
ELIZABETH MOON: Well, they kept on offering like if I ever wanted a caddie that they had one, and so -- and plus I was getting really tired, and it was really helpful to have a caddie.   
 Q.  Does he help you read greens?  On the back nine did he?  
ELIZABETH MOON: When I get really nervous.  For most putts, though, I do it.
