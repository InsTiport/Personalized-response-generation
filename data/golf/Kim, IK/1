 Q.  You're obviously still right there headed into Sunday.  Just what are your thoughts right now?  
IK KIM: Well, I played well today.  I didn't really start off that way that I wanted to.  The wind was really tricky.  The weather said it would be Southwest, but it was mostly west, or northwest, actually, starting off.  So that was tough front nine.  But I came back strong on Eagle to make birdie on number nine and ten.  That helped me a lot.   
It is disappointing on 18, but I did my best.  I didn't know.  I've been hitting the fairway all week, but it was really tough from the rough, coming, and carrying the second shot.  Overall, good round.   
 Q.  Not exhausting at all?  I'm mostly thinking is there additional pressure being that you're in the mix and also being the defending champion?  
IK KIM: Not so much.  I really like the golf course, and I just wanted to perform well as I could, and that's what I was trying to do.   
 Q.  You won here last year, so you've obviously had success on the 18 hole.  But with the changes two years ago, what are your thoughts on it?  Do you like it more the way it is now or how it used to be?  
IK KIM: I think both ways wasn't easy par-5.  So from the tee I hit a fade, so just wind was little bit from the left.  I didn't really execute it that well, but it's a good par-5.  Long hitter can go for it, but at the same time, you can see from the right side, it's not easy to get up-and-down, so it's a great hole.   
 Q.  Overall, how do you feel going into tomorrow?  You're obviously happy with this round, but your mindset going into tomorrow.  
IK KIM: I can't really force anything.  I just have to do a little bit better every day.  That's my goal.  I really had fun today.  It wasn't easy for me, somehow, but I turned it around, so I'm happy for that.
