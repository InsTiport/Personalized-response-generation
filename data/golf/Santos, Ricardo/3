  RICARDO SANTOS:   Definitely really proud with my round today.   I putted really, really well.   Just missed a few drives, but with good putting, I save a few important pars, and made a few birdies.   
   
 Q.   And was it the difference on the greens compared to the first day?   
RICARDO SANTOS:   Definitely.   Today I made a lot of‑‑ well, I put many putts for birdies and even for pars to save my pars.   I think that's the key to make like 1‑ or 2‑under to 6‑ or seven.  
   
 Q.   I said about the wind, and it does seem to have picked up, but it was still pretty tricky when you were out there.   
RICARDO SANTOS:   Yeah, definitely.   The wind, it's tough, because sometimes blow harder than the others, so it's tough to decide which club sometimes, and it's tough to control the distance.   
So I'm really happy, because like you say, it's tough conditions and tricky.   So under par always good.   
   
 Q.   We've seen you play well in bad conditions before and you seem to knuckle down better than some players?  
RICARDO SANTOS:   Well, I try, I try hard, but the game comes today for me, so that's good for me and really enjoy.
