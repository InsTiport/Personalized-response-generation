Q.   Thoughts on being 9‑under par at the halfway stage?
    RICARDO SANTOS:   Yeah, I feel really well, and today, I played quite well also.   Struck the ball very well today.   I just miss a few shots but still happy with the round. 
    This afternoon, the wind is a little bit stronger than the morning, so I'm happy with 2‑under this afternoon.

Q.   You got off to a flying start, three birdies in four holes, you must have thought, this is an easy day?
    RICARDO SANTOS:   Well, it's never easy, but I started really well, after four, minus three, so I think, well, just keep that play. 

Q.   How much difference did the wind make? 
    RICARDO SANTOS:   Well, on the back nine, probably against the wind, two more clubs I think it may have been.   So made a big difference.   Yesterday you can reach the 16th; today, no.   So I think it's a big difference with the wind. 

Q.   Are you excited about the weekend? 
    RICARDO SANTOS:   I just went to play my game the best I can, and then we'll see.   I just want to enjoy the weekend.

Q.   Got to ask how many people have been in touch from home, because they would have taken notice of just how well you're playing? 
    RICARDO SANTOS:   Yeah, lots of messages and phone calls, but I think it's normal, and they appreciate that, they are warm people in Portugal.   I think it's very important for me, and even for the country, as well.   So I'm very happy.
