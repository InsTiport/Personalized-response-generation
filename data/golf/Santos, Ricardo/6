Q.   Another prominent finish?
RICARDO SANTOS:   It's a really nice week and I really enjoyed it.   Like I said yesterday, I just try to enjoy my game and keep solid like the days before, and this I'm doing really well today.

Q.   It's better than solid, isn't it, because you had a very realistic victory chance. 
RICARDO SANTOS:   Yeah, a little bit, a little more pressure today than the other days but it's still a good week, so it's really nice to start the season like this. 
So gave me a lot of confidence and we'll see the next weeks, I'm really happy with this week. 
Q.   Do you get more and more used to playing in that pressure? 
RICARDO SANTOS:   Not really.   I just play a few times with that kind of pressure.   Portugal Masters in 2011, 2010, I think that's the first time I played with that kind of pressure, and last year in Madeira.   So it's my third like, that so I'm really happy.

Q.   Does it feel all the more rewarding knowing that this is a tournament that featured the world's No.1, 2 and 5? 
RICARDO SANTOS:   Yeah, especially with that kind of field, the No. 1, No.2, many players Topâ€‘10 in the world, so I think it means something for me.   It's really good. 

Q.   And it's a great start to the year, isn't it? 
RICARDO SANTOS:   Definitely, I think it helps a lot when you start the season like that.   So just keep going like that and hope better next time.
