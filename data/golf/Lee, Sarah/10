  MIKE SCANLAN:  Sarah Lee, first of all, congratulations.  You tied a course record today.  You shot 63, 8-under, with nine birdies and one bogey.  Can you just take us through this round and tell us how you feel you played?   
 SARAH LEE:  First of all I just played really steady, just hitting all the fairways, hit all the greens and the best I played.   
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Can we go through your score card, if you can remember all of these birdies?  The third hole, what did you hit?   
 SARAH LEE:  I hit driver and I got 234 left, so I hit a 5-iron for layup.  And third shot, I hit a 70-yard uphill, I hit a 58-degree and it's about ten feet.   
 No. 4, hitting driver, and to the pin it's 137 I think and I'm hitting 8-iron and 15 foot downhill putt.   
 No. 5, I hit a 7-iron and 36 feet, birdie.   
 No. 6, I hit a driver and I think 140 left and I hit an 8-iron and five feet.   
 7, I hit a driver and 3-wood and 20-yard chip shot and three feet.   
 9, hitting driver and hitting 7-iron to 11 feet downhill.   
 12, I'm hitting driver and 9-iron and 15 feet.   
 16, I hit a driver and putt from 18 feet.   
 17, I hit a 6-iron to 12 feet.   
  
  Q.  Where did your only bogey come?   
 SARAH LEE:  10th tee.  I was in a little rush because our group was a little behind, and I just took -- hit it really fast and then I pulled my tee shot.  I hit a bad second shot, also and make a bogey.   
  
  Q.  How long was the putt for par?   
 SARAH LEE:  For par, it's like 12 feet.   
  
  Q.  You shot a 60, I guess it was, three years ago?   
 SARAH LEE:  Yeah, 2004.   
  
  Q.  Kind of feel like you did that day?   
 SARAH LEE:  Yes, I mean, everything is working and very comfortable to play today.   
  
  Q.  It you say you ran in one from 36 feet on the fifth hole?   
 SARAH LEE:  16?   
  
  Q.  No, on the fifth, the par 3.   
 SARAH LEE:  Yeah, 36 feet.   
  
  Q.  What did that do, break left, break right, up-and-down?   
 SARAH LEE:  Left-to-right, downhill putt.   
  
  Q.  Were the conditions pretty ideal out there?  We're seeing an awful lot of rounds in the 60s today.  Pretty nice scoring conditions today?   
 SARAH LEE:  Yes, I felt this morning air is really heavy because of fog.  So my iron is going nowhere.   
 So I got maybe extra half-club, you know, to hit a aggressive, so it worked.   
  
  Q.  Do you have a lot of experience as a first-round leader; has this happened to you?   
 SARAH LEE:  Not a lot but I have a few.   
  
  Q.  How do you typically respond to that?   
 SARAH LEE:  You know, it's only first day.  I have three more rounds, so I have to be steady and confidence, and hit a aggressive every try.   
  
  Q.  Is this your career-best round?   
 SARAH LEE:  No, 60 is my best one.   
  
  Q.  And where was that?   
 SARAH LEE:  It was in Tucson, 2004.   
  
  Q.  And was that the first round as well?   
 SARAH LEE:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  Where did you finish that week?   
 SARAH LEE:  Second.   
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Sarah, thanks a lot.  Great round and good luck this week.
