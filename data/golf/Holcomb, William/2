Q. Will Holcomb, you look like you're really having some fun out here?
WILL HOLCOMB: I am.  I've had a hell of a time.  It's been so much fun.
Q. We were talking before you started out today, you were jumping around and talking a lot, but what I took from it is you said you hadn't played a lot of match play and didn't really know how to play it.
WILL HOLCOMB: Yeah, I hadn't, but now I'm pretty experienced, I guess.
Q. It is important to get up early, and you got up 3-up after four.  How important was that?
WILL HOLCOMB: That was just, I mean, crucial.  I don't know, was I -- I think I was only 2-up after four.  But I got up early and I talked to my coach back home last night -- well, he's not back home anymore, he's in New Mexico, and he said -- because I've had an early lead in the last two matches and I kind of gave it away.  He said, just once you get one, just focus on getting one more and just one more.  So we just kept doing that, and it paid off.
Q. One last serious question.  You're a big duck hunter; what's more exciting for you, the ducks coming through the flooded timber or semis of the U.S. Amateur?
WILL HOLCOMB: Probably ducks coming through the timber.
No, they're both fun in their own way.  So I'm blessed to do both.
