Q. You had just an incredible round going.  Started out of the gates so fast birdieing 1 and 2 then four on the front, four on the back.  Couple hiccups on the back.
CHARLOTTE THOMAS: Yes, kind of a bummer to finish like that.  Played really well all day.  Holed some really good putts.  Couple shots they could have happened in the middle of the round and still would've been a good day.  It's just annoying that it had happened at the end.
Yeah, no, happy still.
Q. You're in really good position going into tomorrow.
CHARLOTTE THOMAS: Yeah.
Q. Bunched up leaderboard.
CHARLOTTE THOMAS: Yep.
Q. What do you think it's going to take?
CHARLOTTE THOMAS: More of the same, hopefully without the hiccups.  Yeah, no, just play solid golf and see what happens.  Certainly good players up at the top of the leaderboard.  Just got to do my thing.
Q. How does that T2 that you already have this year feed into your confidence going into tomorrow?
CHARLOTTE THOMAS: Yeah, definitely does.  It's nice to have already been in this position a little bit in Australia at the beginning of the year.
So, yeah, I think it definitely helps confidence.  I just feel a little bit more comfortable out here having had that experience.
Hopefully I can feed off it tomorrow and use it a little bit.
