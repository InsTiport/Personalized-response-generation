Q. How would you describe the day, playing your first PGA TOUR event?
EVAN KAWAI:   It was a lot of fun out there.  Obviously I would have wanted it to go a little bit better but we stuck to our process.  We fought to the end and got our first birdie on 18, so we'll keep it rolling into tomorrow.
Q. What were the nerves like when you teed off on No. 1 today?
EVAN KAWAI:   You know, Carson did a good job.  My caddie did a good job of calming me down.  I felt really good on the tee.  There's a little bit of tightness obviously, but I got a nice kick off the coconut tree into the middle of the fairway, and we were off and rolling.
Q. Was there a part of the day where you looked and you said, "I'm playing in a PGA TOUR event today"?
EVAN KAWAI:   Yeah, almost every hole, I looked at Carson, not bad for our first round, not good, not bad.  The experience was dreamlike out there.
Q. I'm sure you've dreamt of this day for a long time, but did it meet your expectations, exceed your expectations?
EVAN KAWAI:   The crew here at Waialae, they have got the course in great shape.  The greens were really quick.  I blew a couple by today, but you know, they set it up in a way that we can just come out here and have fun and try and play the best golf that we can.
Q. What did you learn about yourself and your game today, and what do you want to improve upon tomorrow?
EVAN KAWAI:   We did a lot of good things.  We stuck to our process.  We didn't do anything wrong.  We had a couple miss-hits on the putts, controlling the speed, but besides that, stayed in it all the day.  Didn't make a mental mistake today.  So I'm happy about that and we'll just keep on rolling into tomorrow.
