 Q.   How was your day out there?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Had to stay patient out there.   It's so tough.   The Back 9 is brutal out there.   I made a double on I don't know which hole it was, 14.   It's tough.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure it's a silly question, but what makes it so tough today when it seems beautiful weather?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   The wind.   I feel the wind is stronger today, I think.   So that's all.  
   
 Q.   And a different direction on the way back?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, it was into the wind all the Back 9.   So it's pretty tough.   Long holes.  
   
 Q.   Are you fighting with yourself, what club to use and how to play particular shots?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No.   Just keep it low.   Keep it low out there.  
   
 Q.   But you make up your mind very quickly, you make up that decision and just go for it.   There's no doubt?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   Yeah.   And I think the Front 9 is pretty tough as well.   When there's so much downwind you hit like 4â€‘iron to 280 meters out there.   It's a joke.  
   
 Q.   I know there's a certain disappointment in not advancing, but are you proud of yourself for the way that you've held things together in these elements?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   In the beginning I struggled a bit with my temperament, but I kept it all right here this week.   It's decent.  
   
 Q.   Looked at that leaderboard?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I love that actually.  
   
 Q.   Well, it still makes for good reading, doesn't it?   It means you're in lovely position for the weekend?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I am sure.   I'm here to win.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel better about your game after the way you played in Ireland than the start in France?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No.   Actually I don't.   Played all right to hold the but my short game was terrible.  
   
 Q.   How much practice are you doing these days?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Out here or at home?   
   
 Q.   Well, both, because you're famed for the amount of hours that you're spending?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   At home it's like 10 to 12 hours.   Here it's not that much.   I need to stay fresh and focus on the tournament.  
   
 Q.   And yet you'll know what's been happening with Alex Noren and the problems he's been having.   He practiced a lot.   Have you thought about changing things?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, no.   It's hard for him.   He's so depressed right now.   He doesn't know what he's going to do.   So it's sad for him.  
   
 Q.   Isn't that a lesson?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   For him it is.  
   
 Q.   But you're a stronger man?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, but I'm stronger than him.   (Laughs).
