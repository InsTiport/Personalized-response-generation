  KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I played all right obviously.   I'm just happy to have a good finish and a good tournament.  
   
 Q.   On The European Tour, this is one of your best finishes, isn't it?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I finished second in 2012.   I'm just glad to get a top three here, very happy.  
   
 Q.   What was the story of the final day?   What did you do out there?   What were the highlights?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I played really bad.   My putter was not doing well.   I missed many short putts out there.   Stick to the game plan.   
   
 Q.   And yet that birdie at the last, that was so important for 11‑under par.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, hit a 4‑iron into it and just a little left into the hazard, but it stayed on the grass and chipped and it missed on the edge, so easy birdie there.  
   
 Q.   Are you the sort of player that looks at the leaderboards and appreciates that Mikko is not running away?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Not at all.   
   
 Q.   Did you sense that you still have that chance even down the home stretch?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, played so bad, so just happy to be at 11‑under par.   
   
 Q.   It is a good sign, because there's other big events to come, as well?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:
