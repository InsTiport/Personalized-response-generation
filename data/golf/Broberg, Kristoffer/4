KRISTOFFER BROBERG: It's big for me, first time I've played in a team event like this.  I'm looking forward to it.
Q. Are you enjoying it?  Are you noticing the change from playing as an individual and suddenly being part of a team?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Yeah, it's a lot of fun with all the team members and we do some fun stuffs after the rounds.  We cannot practise so much; it's so hot, but it's really fun.
Q. What makes it fun?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: This is like so much different.  This week, you're not playing for your own; you're playing for a team, and it's the first team for me to play.
Q. Do you have any experience in amateur days of team golf?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: No, but I have played match play.
Q. That in itself is good fun, fourballs, foursomes, just a little bit different to what you're used to in the Match Play?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Of course.  If your partner doesn't play well and you don't play well, then, you know, just -- I don't know.
Q. Did you have a good break over winter?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: I practiced a bit indoors, 50 meters in the tent, and then I went to London over Christmas with my girlfriend for a couple of days, and then Dubai after New Year's.
Q. With such a fantastic finish to 2015, did you set new targets, new aims for this year?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Of course, but I keep it on my own.
Q. You'll enjoy this despite the heat, are you?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Yeah, of course.
