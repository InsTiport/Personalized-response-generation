  KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I had a lot of fun out there today.   Just keep patient and play your golf.   I played really, really good out there.   I made three mistakes out there, two 3‑putts, but played all right.  
   
 Q.   Looked like an up‑and‑down start but you really got it back together again.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I actually played all right.   I hit a bad shot on the first tee, and hit a bad chip from there, 2‑putt, bogey.   Birdied the second and 3‑putted the third and just keep on rolling.  
   
 Q.   Does it make a difference to you when you know it's the third round and you're in amongst the leaders; does it make a difference to your approach?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, just keep going to your game plan and play your golf.   There's good players out there but I've won four times on The Challenge Tour.   
   
 Q.   How much do you draw on that experience?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Out there today, a lot, actually.   Just keep focused and don't think at the leaderboard.   Just go for your game and hit your shots and stay patient.   
   
 Q.   I know it's still a young career, but you have that marvelous time, everybody expected you to do so well on The European Tour and it was hard work for a little while.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Of course.   I think the players here are so much better and all the things are much bigger.   It's like crowd and like so much bigger grandstands, like everything is bigger.   
   
 Q.   But you're growing used to that; do you like it?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, a lot.   It's good when they are cheering, I love it.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts going into the game when you know you have a tiny bit of ground to make up?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Just stay patient and hit your shots.   Same for everybody out there.
