Q.   Please tell me how well you've played over these three days. 
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I've played all right from tee‑to‑green, didn't make so many putts.   But today I was awful from the tee and hit very good iron shots and my putter was smoking hot.

Q.   And it's built you nicely up that leaderboard, so what are your thoughts on the position in the tournament?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I'm just thinking I need to have a good tournament, but so far back in The Race to Dubai and keep my card.

Q.   The form has been coming, though? 
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, played all right but my short game is terrible.   Need to get it all done tomorrow. 

Q.   Is there any reason why there's been the dip in form, because we expect good things from you?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, I think I played good but my short game has been so bad.   When I worked with Pete Cowen, it's much improving, so pretty good.

Q.   What do you think of playing in The Irish Open, because there's so many crowds; it's good, isn't it?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, it's wonderful.   The people are so good and amazing, cheering all the time, it's pretty good. 

Q.   Do you like this course, Fota Island? 
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   It's brilliant, good course good, greens, as well.   Can't complain. 

Q.   We saw you at your best on The Challenge Tour with those victories to make the progress.   What are your thoughts now that you might have this victory chance on the final day? 
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Didn't think so much of that.   I just play the game and make some good round tomorrow.
