 Q.   Your thoughts on the way this whole week was worked out and a lovely, prominent finish?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I'm just happy to be runner‑up to Justin Rose.   He played really well this week.   I'm just happy.   
   
 Q.   That final day, it looked like you had so many chances.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, I played all right actually.   Just stayed patient but didn't putt so well today, but a few dropped in the end.   
   
 Q.   Those putts looked like they were on‑line or just broke or came up short and not quite getting the breaks.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   In the beginning, I didn't have the speed.   Hit a good one on 9 and a good one on 14, and two good up‑and‑downs on 15 and 16, so really good.  
   
 Q.   How often do you look at leaderboards when you're up there?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Every time.   Today was every time.  
   
 Q.   And does your attitude change when you see the relative scores to Justin?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, no, not at all.   Stick to my game plan and play my game.  
   
 Q.   How different was the course today with the way the elements changed?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   It played very, very easy today.   The greens were soft and no wind out there.   It was perfect weather to play golf.  
   
 Q.   You go to The Open Championship in lovely form.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, I've played really well for a couple of weeks now and just very, very happy to play in The Open.   So first major, so very happy.   
   
 Q.   Justin is playing the 17th as we talk and you've posted 14‑under, how do you feel about that?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I'm feeling great being here at 14‑under.   I played good all week.   So just happy to be 14‑under.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through the emotions as your round progressed; Justin got off to a flying start.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   He got a flying start and I just stick to my game plan.   Just be patient out there.   I missed a few putts in the beginning and they dropped in the end, so I'm pleased.  
   
 Q.   As you made the back nine and you're three shots behind, do you change your game plan?   We saw you take driver off 15.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah that was not a good position from the tee.   I made par there, as well.   But no, actually not.  
   
 Q.   17 you hit a fantastic tee shot.   Talk us through what you were trying to hit there.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I hit a hard 9 from 159 metres and had a lucky bounce in the upslope.   Nearly went in.   
   
 Q.   What about the experience you got today, how valuable is that going to be going forward?   Obviously we know you're threatening to win now.   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, I think it's going to be very, very important for my game.   I just love to be out there and love to play in the lead.   I'm just happy.  
   
 Q.   What about thoughts going into The Open Championship next week in this sort of form?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I played all right actually, like a couple of months now.   But my short game is so much better right now.   I'm just pleased to be in The Open and play my first major.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on qualifying for The Open Championship?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Oh, wow, big, but I'm just happy to be in The Open.   My first major, so just glad to be there.   I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   One of those things you've dreamed about since being a young boy?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, definitely.   I know my first time I'm going to be there with a smile on my face.  
   
 Q.   Is it one of those things that at home in Sweden you watch on TV and said you'd like a taste of that?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, I like The Open most of the majors actually.   So I watch The Open the most on television.   I don't like Augusta.   But The Open is special for me.  
   
 Q.   Something appeal about links golf?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, I like links golf. You need to stay patient.   You get an unlucky bounce, it's an unlucky bounce.  
   
 Q.   Did you watch the last time it was at Royal Liverpool when Tiger Woods won?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, he hit only irons off the tee.   He hit 4‑iron, 4‑iron to the hole.   It looks tough out.  
   
 Q.   What's your approach going to be?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I don't know.   Never played it before.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to enjoy it and go there with confidence and excitement?   
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah, enjoy it, I'm going to.   I'm just so happy I don't have words for it.
