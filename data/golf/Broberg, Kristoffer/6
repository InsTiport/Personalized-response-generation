Q. First of all, congratulations, you're a four-time winner on The Challenge Tour, but what's it like now to win on the big stage of The Final Series?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: That's a dream come true.  I've worked so hard all my life for this.   I have no words.
Q. You were cruising along very, very well, mate, on that back nine and then you hit that wonderful shot in there to the par 4, the 14th, very tight in there.  Right there, did you just -- did you allow yourself the time to think?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Not at all.  Not against these players.  World-class players.
Q. To go head-to-head in the playoff with Patrick Reed, a WGC champion in his own right, he won at Doral a few years back, and he's the boy from The Ryder Cup for the American Team.  What was that like standing on the 18th tee?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Hit a good swing with my driver.  Just hit a long one left side, and a pure 9-iron into the green and made the putt.  I have no words.  I don't know what to say.
Q. And you go and have a great night celebrating.  Is it going to be your shout at the dinner table?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: I think so.  Henrik took the bill yesterday, so it's my bill today.
