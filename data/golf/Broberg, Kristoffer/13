Q.   Kristoffer, yesterday I was chatting with some of the players and they were saying level par is a good score here.   You've just shot 6‑under par.   You better explain how.
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Kept the ball in play, hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and made a few putts out there.

Q.   It sounds simple, but I'm sure it isn't.
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   The wind is tough, so you need to have patience out there.   Yeah.

Q.   6‑under par through 12 holes, birdieing almost every second hole.   What are you thinking, what are you feeling as the round is progressing?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No, just play around.   Keep playing, keep on going and hit a few good shots out there.   Keep patient.

Q.   Did you come into the week believing that you were playing very well?   You've had some good results recently?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I've played pretty well at least what, two weeks now.   I'm pleased with the game, so I'm happy.

Q.   How much experience with links golf do you have?   Do you feel you're pretty good at links golf generally?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Not much.   I play a couple of events in Scotland.

Q.   How much do you have to modify your game to play in these conditions?   Do you have to hit shots that you don't usually hit?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No.   Just keep them pretty low.

Q.   You burst on to the scene in 2012 by winning four times on the challenge tour.   Obviously when you came to the main tour everyone is saying, wow, this guy can really play.   Did you feel the weight of the expectation?   Was that difficult when people expected big things of you?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   No.   I just had two injuries, one on my foot and one in my chest.   So I just struggled with the game a bit.   So no, I'm pleased with the game.   I'm just happy to play.

Q.   With the recent results you've had, you've sort of secured your license for next year.   Does that mean now you can relax and just enjoy and attack a little bit more?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I think so.   I'm just pleased to keep my card.   So I'm just happy.

Q.   Great playing today.   Congratulations.   Well done.
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Thank you.

Q.   How did you play out there?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I played really, really well.   I hit very good shots and a lot of close ones, so this helps a bit.   And kept me away from those bunkers and stayed patient.

Q.   A very early start.   Do you sense from first thing this morning that it could be a good day?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I woke up and saw the wind out there.   It's the same for all.   A little less wind to start, but it got more windy after like eight holes.   So the same for everybody.

Q.   Did you feel comfortable?   Did you sense that there would be plenty of birdies?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Actually, no.   But I started pretty well, a birdie on No. 1, and just kept on going.   Birdied, what, 6, 8, 9.

Q.   How much links golf do you play and how do you like it?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I like it a lot.   I mean you need to hit them low, so I like it.

Q.   Do you enjoy the creativity that's involved?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   Of course.   I love this course.   It's a beautiful course.   I like it.

Q.   What can you sense as being‑‑ yours is obviously a very, very good start, but do you reckon it's going to stand the test of time today?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   I don't know.

Q.   All depends what happens with the weather, doesn't it, on a course like this?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   If it stays like this, it's going to be pretty tough out there.

Q.   Do you feel pretty good about your game after what happened in Ireland and the start you enjoyed in France?
KRISTOFFER BROBERG:   Yeah.   I played pretty good a long time, but I've struggled with my short game.   Just want to keep on going.
