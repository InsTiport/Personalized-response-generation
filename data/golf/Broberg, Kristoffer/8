 Q.  Enjoyable day?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Yeah, it was good.   
 Q.  Tell me about it?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Played good, really good from tee to green today.  I made almost every birdie putt I had today, although most of them were pretty close, so it was one of those days where you just enjoy it.   
 Q.  You seem to do quite well in Scotland?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Yeah, I just love playing links golf, although I have to admit that the old Course is my least favourite of the three we play this week. I prefer Carnoustie and Kingsbarns, because I don't know the lines around the Old course as well as I do the others. But I have John Dempster who worked for Oli Wilson last year when he won so I had a guy on the bag who knows this place as well as anyone. When he tells me to hit it over there then I just hit it over there so it was pretty easy today.  I have to say itâs really good to have him on the bag.  Then I played Carnoustie a lot when I was an amateur so I am really looking forward to that tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did you have any good results there?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: I just played with friends over there, coming over from Sweden to play some golf when I was younger. It's good fun there. Now it's switched, 12 and 14 are par 5s.  That course is pretty tough - 16 and 17 are two of the toughest holes you will play and it is such a strong finish to that course.   
 Q.  And this event?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: It's a cool event - it takes a long time to get around obviously but it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Have you got goals for the rest of the season?  
KRISTOFFER BROBERG: Iâm 58th on the Race to Dubai at the moment, so I want to play my way into the DP World Tour Championship at the end of the season.  So that's my main goal for the moment.
