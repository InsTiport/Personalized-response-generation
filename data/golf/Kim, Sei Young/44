Q. Not the final round that you wanted, but are you happy with how you did here?SEI YOUNG KIM: Very disappointed.Q. What do you think went wrong?SEI YOUNG KIM: Overall my shots really weren't going the way I wanted to especially on the back nine.  I think I still had a few opportunities where I had a chance to win it, but unfortunately the shots weren't there.Q. Do you think that the course was there or did the course play a part into missing the shots?SEI YOUNG KIM: It was just very difficult to figure out things, especially with the wind factoring in.  I mean, without the wind, I think I could have figured it out, but when you have the wind as strong as it is today, it really confused me a lot.Q. How can you build off of this for next time?SEI YOUNG KIM: I think what I'll get out of this week is next time I'm in a similar situation I know what options I have.  I think I can learn from that and I can make better decisions.Q. I know you had said yesterday that Stacy Lewis was like a veteran and you were nervous to talk to her.  How was it to play with her, and did you learn anything from playing with her?SEI YOUNG KIM: What I was really amazed with was her putting stroke.  Her putting is just phenomenal.  Today I was busy myself trying to figure out my own game, so I didn't really have time to learn a lot.  But one thing I did note was her putting was phenomenal.
