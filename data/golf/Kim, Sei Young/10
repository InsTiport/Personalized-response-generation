 Q.  Obviously things were all working for you today.  How good did you feel today?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: We played only morning a couple holes.  I got great striking the ball, and feels good, my putter, so yeah, it was good work today.   
 Q.  There were a couple holes, and I can't remember which ones, where Charley made a big putt and you responded.  How big was that for your confidence?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I got the momentum of the putter, so yeah, Charley is a great player, so we are great competitors.  Yeah, I try working on it.   
 Q.  Sunday singles today, was it hard not to have a teammate out there with you?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was a little quieter than when I played with So Yeon Ryu.  We had fun out there, but today I just played alone with Charley, but we are pretty quiet, yeah.  It was nice.   
 Q.  Team Korea, obviously you needed to play very well to win this.  Were you on a mission?  Did you know that you wanted, needed to win this match?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: In this format, who's got to win, so I just enjoy and just need them to follow me.
