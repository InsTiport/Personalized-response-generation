 Q.  Sei Young, I don't know if you were aware coming down the stretch that you were in the running to tie Annika's total record on the LPGA Tour in terms of scoring.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  It's a dream come true.  Today I scored 10-under.  It's my best score ever, ever.  I didn't know that after last putt.  But after I check the score card, I asked to Paul, my caddy, I said, did I shoot 10-under.  He said, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing, yeah.  Dream come true.  So feel great.   
 Q.  Last November you gave a wonderful speech honoring Louise Suggs when you earned the rookie of the year title.  What does it mean to you to get your fourth LPGA Tour win and your first one not on an island here at the Founders tournament?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  When I speak to Louise Suggs of the year, so I'm really prepare with my family and then my manager.  They were a lot of help me.  And yeah, that's a lot mean to me.  Since I was young, that was a dream.  And then, yeah, what was the last question.   
 Q.  Just about getting that win.  Let me ask you this.  You played so well, and you're getting closer and closer to a major title.  You've been in contention in majors before, haven't pulled through.  What kind of confidence does this performance give you with the ANA inspiration only now two weeks away?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Last couple tournaments I lost my confidence, and so I try and finding, come back to my confidence.  But after this tournament, I come back say I'm Kim, so that's most happy to that.   
 Q.  You are a young superstar on tour and a lot of fans out here pulling for you.  Sei Young, congratulations.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Thank you so much.
