 Q.  You did really well last week, played fairly well -- but you didn't so.  What was going on?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I didn't think so but not bad.   
 Q.  What's been going on with your game recently?  Do you feel good?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Last week?   
 Q.  Last week or in general.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, these days, my shot was not working.   
 Q.  Today?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Last week.  So I tried to find what's wrong with my shots.  And then I checked up at the driving range, and now I feel very good now.  They have come back, my shots.   
 Q.  What did you work on in the range?  Anything in particular?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I used what was my best shot in my shots, so in the past, when my shots were working well, I just focused on the target.  But a few weeks ago, my thinking became too confused, my swing, like that.   
 Q.  Have you been thinking about Rookie of the Year at all?  Have you been thinking about it?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Sometimes.  A lot of people ask me.   
 Q.  Media or players?  Who asks you?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just gallery and then some Korean press.   
 Q.  What do they ask you?  Are you nervous about it?  Are you just --  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, is that your goal.  So I said, my goal is the Rolex top five.  If I can get a Rookie of the Year, it's good for me.   
 Q.  Just an added plus kind of?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  And top five -- what are you ranked right now?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: 11th.   
 Q.  So you're getting there?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Would you consider this year a success, for your first year, two wins?  You've played fairly well.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Almost.  Almost.   
 Q.  What's holding you back from saying so?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I hope to have one more win.  If I have one more win, that's perfect this year.   
 Q.  Did you think you could win three times at the start of the year or was it because you got two wins, you think, all right, I should get another one?  Starting your first event, did you think, I'm going to win three times?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, three times.   
 Q.  So three was always the number?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  How is playing in Asia?  Did you play in Thailand and Singapore?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  So how did you get prepared for this; any particular way?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes, I stayed three weeks in Korea and I meet my coach and my trainer.  We talk about the Asian Tour.  We make the new strategy.   
 Q.  When was the last time you saw them?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Two days ago.   
 Q.  So are they here with you?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: No.   
 Q.  So just last week you saw them?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  How often do you get to see them; a couple times a year?  Or is that the first time you've seen them?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Many times have met them.   
 Q.  Do they come to the U.S. at all?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Sometimes.  A couple times they came in the U.S.   
 Q.  And what was the strategy?  Just refresh or what was the --  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, in the beginning, LPGA Tour, I was very fresh, but now after two wins, I feel like a little too tight.  And I want more wins -- too greedy, so they make me more easier and relaxed --   
 Q.  So you're feeling a little tired?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, when I feel a little tired, I couldn't control myself.   
 Q.  Did you take any time off?  Did you rest at all or did you continue?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I met my friends.   
 Q.  In Korea?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: In Korea.   
 Q.  Did you see a lot of friends or just a couple?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just a couple because they are so busy, because one friend plays the KLPGA tour and the other golf, other friend, plays in Japan.   
 Q.  So they are golfers, too?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes.   
 Q.  Are you and Hyo Joo, are you friends?  Do you trash talk?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, we talk a lot.  She didn't care.   
 Q.  She's too easygoing.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  So you try to trash talk and she's like, whatever?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.

SEI YOUNG KIM: Two years ago I played.  I played the Swinging Skirts.   
 Q.  What do you think about the course?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: The course is very strong wind, every day.  So I need -- hard to control in the wind, factor.   
 Q.  Do you play well in the wind?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I like wind, because I win in courses like the Bahamas, strong wind.  So I like that.   
 Q.  What are you looking forward to this week?  Do you feel comfortable obviously being home in Asia, close to home?  Good food?
