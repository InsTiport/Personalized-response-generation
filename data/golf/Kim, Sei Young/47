Q. Strong finish today.   Strong finish for the tournament.   You have to feel pretty good about your year so far. 
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I didn't have too high of an expectation coming in thi year, but I think I'm doing a lot better than I anticipated. 
It's still early in the season, but I think things are going well.   We'll see how things go the rest of the year. 

Q.   Why did you think things are going well?   What's working? 
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I think overall my shots, I got a pretty good feel for my shots so I have more time and energy to really focus on my short game.
That really cuts down my other things I have to do.   I am focused on the short game, and that is directly translating into better scores.

Q.   How important is the Olympics for you? 
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I think it's significant that it's the first time for the game of who.   A lot of us we play on the LPGA Tour there is a lot firsts of something, so I think it just adds it another title of what we can go do and what we can accomplish the first time in history, so I look forward to the challenge.
