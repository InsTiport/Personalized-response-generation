Q. Only two back, how do you feel about that?  Ha Na was up three going into the day, so you made some progress.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Ha Na is the leader now?
Q. She's the leader by two.  She's at 7-under, you're at 5.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I think she played well last year, so this course is, I think, good for her.  Yeah, I wasn't -- I played bad last year, missed the cut.  I wished the bounceback this year.  I think this week is great competitors with Ha Na or another player.
Q. Why was the course playing so much harder this morning than yesterday?  The scores are not as good this morning as they were yesterday by a long ways.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yesterday pretty warm in the morning, but we got a lot of rain, so they weren't rolling today in the morning.  Today is pretty cool.  I think over 30 meters less distance, so playing pretty long for us.  It's just difficult today.  Anyway, I got a lot of birdie chance, but I couldn't make it in, so I hope to go to putting practice, and yeah, keep going.
Q. Being from Korea you're used to the cold; is that an advantage for some of the girls?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Korea pretty cold, winter season very cold.  Maybe practice in winter fine, so for me and for Korean players, it's not a tough day.
Q. How do you turn it around with such a quick turnaround between tee times?  Do you think that'll be difficult?  Will it be tough playing this many holes today?  You're going to play 35 holes or 32 holes today.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I think we've got to play too much holes maybe, but we needed to keep -- have to keep the energy.  The best thing is the later stroke; make a birdie is good for energy, yeah.
