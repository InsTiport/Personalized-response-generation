 Q.  So how important was it for you to get up and down for that par on 18?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Pretty good last hole.  Up and down, make the par couple last hole I missed the second shot and the tee shot.  So I got the two bogeys.  Yeah, it's okay, but I have one day, tomorrow.   
 Q.  So the eagle on 13, how far do you think that was for that the shot you made?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: The tee shot or?   
 Q.  Both.  The tee shot and what you had left when you made it.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: The tee shot, 235 meter to the front to 10 meter.  Then I pick up the 3-wood and made the shot, and good work.  A little short 10 meter, almost 30 feet, on the edge.  I try the putter, but yeah, it's good.   
 Q.  And you've been in this position before where you're trying to hunt down the lead not in the final group.  Is that something you're more comfortable with being a chaser on the final round?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.  It's okay.  But I like the play the chase on the lead, it's more comfortable to me.  So yeah, it's a good position.   
 Q.  Is there any reason that you feel more comfortable trying to be the chaser?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  I just keep it up the -- keep up the play so I don't have to care about the read, yeah.  I just play, focus my game easier than, yeah, last group.
