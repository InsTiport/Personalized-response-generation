 Q.  It looked extremely windy and the conditions are obviously really tough.  Is that the windiest you've played in a while?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: This week.  Last week still same, windy.  Yeah, I find it helped to play well in the wind today.   
 Q.  I remember you said last week, you said, I like playing in the wind; you won in Hawai'i and the Bahamas where it's all windy.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I like the windy weather because I'm using a lot of skills and low cut shots.  Very interesting.   
 Q.  Did you look at the leaderboard at all?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I saw that.   
 Q.  What were you thinking?  Were you thinking, what's going on?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, today it's very tough.  I think I play with Suzann tomorrow.  If I play with her, it's the first time, so I'm very looking forward.  When I was young, I watched her.   
 Q.  She was your idol?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  You've never played with her?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Never, never.   
 Q.  So you're thinking, all right, let me get to 1-under at least?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Last week, you said you want to get three wins, that was your goal this year?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, this year.   
 Q.  Obviously you're in good position to do that?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I think good position now, good opportunity come to me.  So I want to catch this opportunity.  But I have to be patient because the past couple tournament, I was like too greedy and then I couldn't be patient.   
 Q.  So patience wasn't as good and you're getting better at that this week?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes.   
 Q.  How did you do that?  Has Paul helped you, or what's been the difference that you have been able to be patient?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Paul helped me, and I'm just focusing my mind.  Sometimes very up-and-down my mind, so just inner peace.   
 Q.  Just all in your head?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, that's very important.   
 Q.  What did you think about this course when you first saw it?  This is your first time here?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, first time.  This course, the greens are very grainy, and so I was practicing a lot on the green.  That helped me a lot.  And I think the green surrounds are very important.  I practiced the pitch and the chip.  It worked.   
 Q.  It did work.  Now you see the scoreboard, there's a lot of people within one or two shots.  Does that -- do you like that or would you rather be more separated?  Do you like it packed with a lot of people?  Give you more incentive to go out and play better?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, play better.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, what are you going to try and do?  The same as today?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just the same as today and the last day, and keep the focus in my mind.  And then practice a lot.  Keep practicing and relax.
