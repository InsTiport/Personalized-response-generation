 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, front nine a little bit stronger than the back nine, but the back nine very, yeah, not too strong the wind.  So I play easier.   
But I hit the driver a little bit miss a lot left side, so, yeah.  But without that, pretty well today.   
 Q.  Were you watching the leaderboard during the round?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Am I lead now?  I didn't...   
 Q.  Second back.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Who's the leader?   
 Q.  Su-Young Jang.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Su-Young Jang, oh.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Will you keep paying attention to that at all or not really?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I didn't see that.  Yeah, because last couple tournament I too much check the leaderboards, so it's not good for me.   
After that round I decide when I in the course I never see the scoreboard.  That's better.   
 Q.  Do you know Su-Young Jang?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  You play with her a lot?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, when I play in Korea I play with her a lot of time.  Yeah, she's very good player.  I know she's couple years very hard time because, yeah, playing not well.   
But last week she win the Lotte Championship by Korea, so I think that tournament will momentum for her.   
Yeah.  She's play well after that, yeah.   
 Q.  Would that be a comfortable pairing tomorrow if you were in a group with her?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah, very comfortable.  We a lot of talk with her, yeah.  We didn't see much time, so I have a lot of story I want to tell something to her.   
Yeah.
