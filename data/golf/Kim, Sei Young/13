Q. Sei Young, first experience at UL International Crown; how was it being on the first tee and experiencing everything?
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was really fun standing on the first tee.  I could hear the funky music, yeah.  It was fun.
Q. What were both of you guys' thoughts on the match today?  Obviously you came up short, but you put up quite a fight down the stretch and made it pretty close.
SO YEON RYU: Well, actually I think we played pretty great.  Sei Young made a lot of birdies, then so am I, then especially Sei Young made a lot of clutch putts.  It was awesome, and I really enjoyed playing -- actually how she plays, it was a really fun day.  But yeah, just the Chinese girls just played really, really great.  They made an eagle, they made a bunker shot.  I think their teamwork was really nice.  Like when one missed a tee shot, the other one would just make a good birdie or have a good makeup.
I would say maybe it was their day, you know.
Q. What's the approach going into tomorrow, same teams, going to switch it up a little bit?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, we decided to just go into play with the same teams.  We played great today, but we couldn't win today.  Hopefully we're going to make a really good one tomorrow.
