Q. Put your hand on the two eagles, the eagle on number 2.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Again, hole 2, I got the second shot was 200 to the pin.  I pick up the driver, try the shot because it's downwind.  I have to make the -- stay in my bowl because the greens are very firmer.  So it was good work.
Q. How close did you hit the shot?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Ten meters right side.
Q. So 30 feet?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, 30 feet.
Q. And then the eagle on the back nine on 15?
SEI YOUNG KIM: 15, hit the driver, was good.  And the second shot was a 165 to the pin.
Q. How far did you hit the driver?
SEI YOUNG KIM: 300 meters -- yards, yeah.  300 yards.
Q. We saw that on TV.  It looked like it almost hopped in.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  I heard the cameraman told me it was almost in the hole.  I was oh.
Q. And that was about a 5-foot putt?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes.  But the putt -- I wasn't missing the putt, but it was in the hole.  I was shocked.
Q. Sum up your day today for us.  Just your feelings about your round.  Overall, your round.
SEI YOUNG KIM: I feel not bad because, before the first round, I was like uncomfortable because I couldn't trust myself.  But after this round, I got confidence.
Q. The 15 under right now is a tournament record for 36 holes for this tournament.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, record to me.  This is the first time.
Q. You've got a two-stroke lead also, it looks like, going into the weekend.  Keep going low, make lots of birdies and eagles?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I don't think -- I don't know, but I try to just focus what I do know, yeah.
Q. Was the wind that picked up a little tricky this afternoon?
SEI YOUNG KIM: The wind?
Q. The wind, the breeze.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, but it's okay.  It's not confusing to me because, if I have a lot of options, I didn't think about it.  I just see a target.  Yeah, that's it.  It's simple.
