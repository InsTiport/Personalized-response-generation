  MODERATOR:   Happy to be joined by Sei Young Kim, one of the co‑leaders of this event at ‑under.   Sei Young, what was the key to your round today.  
SEI YOUNG KIM:   (Through translation.)   I had pretty good shot and putter was good.   
I could deal with the wind.   That's why I got a really good score.   
MODERATOR:   You're coming off a tough final round at the ANA Inspiration.   You seem to be bouncing back pretty well.   What did you do during the off week?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   (Through translation.)   I didn't have good condition during the ANA Inspiration so I did a lot of practice during the week.   
Then to refresh my feelings I went out with friends to have a lot of talk and then had some rest.   
MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   What will be the key for you to continue to play this well and be sitting here talking to us again on Saturday?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   (Through translation.)   Generally my shot condition was really good, after my first one of the tournament I got a lot of confidence with that.   That's why I could do well.  
MODERATOR:   What's your relationship with Inbee?   I know you played with her today.   How well do you know her and how comfortable were you playing with her today?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I feel really comfortable when I play with Inbee.   I can talk with Inbee and it's really fun to play with her.   She gave a lot of advice.   That's why I did well and had a lot of good time.   
MODERATOR:   Anything else Sei Young?  
   
 Q.   I think you said earlier that the wind did not bother you too much.   In your background when you played when you were younger, when you learned to play golf, was there a lot of wind?   You have experience with this different kind of wind?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   (Through translation.)   I don't have a lot of experience with the wind.   I didn't do well with great wind before.  
That's why I went out to practice a lot with my caddie.   I practiced a lot of shots.   That's why I did well with the wind.   
MODERATOR:   Anything else?   
   
 Q.   Last year, did that experience in those two rounds help you this year coming back being more familiar with the course now?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   Yeah, more familiar this year, yeah.   Last year...   
(Through translation)   I felt a little bit uncomfortable with the course.   This year it's the second time.   I feel more comfortable with the course.   
MODERATOR:   Good playing.   Thanks for your time.
