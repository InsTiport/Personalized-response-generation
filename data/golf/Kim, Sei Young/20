THE MODERATOR: Happy to be joined in the media center by 2016 JTBC Founders Cup champion, Sei Young Kim.  Sei Young, how does it feel to be the champion this week?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I feel so exciting right now, and yeah, I've been waiting a long time.  Yeah, I had a couple of tournaments, very struggle with myself, and then, yeah, after last putt I think about a lot of people, my family and then supporting, all those people.  Yeah, so I feel like almost crying.  Yeah.
THE MODERATOR: 27-under par.  Did you think that number was possible this week out there?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I didn't think that, but I thought -- I guess probably -- if I win, I had to low score.
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions.
Q. Do you know much about Annika Sorenstam?
SEI YOUNG KIM: 59.  Yeah.  I know that.
Q. Do you know much about her?
SEI YOUNG KIM: When I set my goal before, first thing was 18-under like Annika Sorenstam, because before I begin this tournament I read -- I read a book about Annika Sorenstam.  Yeah, so I got a lot of inspire, that story.  So yeah.
If I make a lot of goals, I hope to get there, 59, yeah.
Q. Do you know the name of the book?
SEI YOUNG KIM: That's a Korean name, yeah.  Korean name.
Q. So was Annika one of the players you looked up to when you were coming up in the game of golf?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yes.  Yeah.  Always I follow her.  She's -- when I rest time, I search the Annika Sorenstam story and then how to practice her.  Yeah, I'm always following her.  Yeah.
Q. Big week in Korean golf, too, with Se Ri announcing that she's going to retire after this season.  How important was she in your growth in the game?
SEI YOUNG KIM: She's still my idol.  I was young.  I watch TV on her play, watch TV.  Yeah.  So after that, I decided if I play golf, I'll hopefully play on the LPGA.  Yeah.  She gave me opportunity of LPGA play.
Q. In the past you've had dramatic wins out here.  You know, you won in the playoff in the Bahamas.  You had that amazing hole-out in Hawaii.  You won by a stroke in China.  This one you kind of won going away.  Is there any different feel to it when you win by such a large margin?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  This tournament very different part of another win.  So I wasn't really nervous before I play today, because -- yeah.  But I like this position.  But yeah, I just nervous on today.
Q. You mentioned yesterday that you liked being the chaser.  Do you think that was an advantage for you today playing in the second-to-last group?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  Today I play with Jacqui.  She's a great player, and then she's made me more comfortable and a lot of talk.  Yeah, so we played very well each other.  Yeah.  That's very good for me today.
Q. What were you thinking on the beautiful shot on No. 11 for the eagle?  And was that a 5-wood again?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  That was 220 to the pin in front, 210.  I picked up the 5-wood.  I feel like a little bit of goal right.  I practice and then just focus on the pin and just hit it.  Yeah, I was like surprised, almost close, yeah, I make the opportunity.  So yeah, it's exciting after that shot.
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Sei Young?  Great playing, Sei Young.  Congratulations again.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Thank you.
