 Q.  Can you just sum up your day for us?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I think I play well today because I shot better than the last couple of tournaments because I struggled with my shots.  I was a little confident with my shots, my swing.  Yeah, but after last week, I played a little more better.  So I did best today.   
 Q.  The other two girls in your group played very well today.  I think you're three of the top four in the tournament in your group.  Did you feed off them a little bit today, too?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah.  We all played very well, so I like to play the speed up.  So yeah, just having fun.   
 Q.  After winning three times last year and being rookie of the year, what kind of goals did you set coming into this year?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: My goal, first thing is Olympics to represent the country.  The second one is four wins this year, hopefully.  I don't think much my goal.  I just focus on what I do now.
