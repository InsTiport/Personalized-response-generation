Q. Your last start was in Texas, but you had a missed cut at ANA and Swinging Skirts.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, Swinging Skirts, that course was really tough to me.  So yeah, I have to make the fairway, but if I miss it right or left, it's all the trees, so it was tough to me.  My shot was really bad.
After that tournament, I knew that what I did change, yeah.  It was a good experience.

I've got a lot of stress, yeah.  I tried during the off time, took off time, just how to make the relax, and more recognize for my situation, yeah.
Q. How do you relax on the golf course and not think about the Olympics?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, not think about Olympics, just stay in the moment and step by step.
Q. Shot by shot?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, shot by shot.  I don't see the -- I try not to see the scoreboard.  That helps me a lot.
Q. What was working today?  What do you like about this course?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I think the tee shots.  Also this course is very important, the tee shots.  Yeah, today was a good day.  I did well with the tee shots and then made the putts, and good up-and-downs.
Q. Can you talk about I guess it was 16, 17 and 18 you birdied, right?
SEI YOUNG KIM: 15, 16, 17.
Q. That seemed to get you going.  Can you sort of talk about those three holes?  Did you feel like that sort of got you started today?
SEI YOUNG KIM: The 15th hole, it was a par-5.  To the pin, 220 meters, but that was a right pin, but I had to stay left my second shot, but I missed on the right side, but it was good luck it's not going in the hazard.  So yeah, easy chip, and then I made that putt.
Next hole, second shot was to the pin 130 meters.  I use meters.
Q. That's okay.
