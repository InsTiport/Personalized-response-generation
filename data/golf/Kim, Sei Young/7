Q. How was the play out there for you?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Today my shot condition really good, so I had a lot of birdie opportunities, but I couldn't make a lot of birdies.  But a couple misses with the putts and a couple made it, so it was good play.
Q. You're in a position that you seem to like; you have a chance to be in the last group but you're not on the lead, get to play from behind.  I know in the past you've said you like trying to chase someone down.  How excited are you to have that opportunity again?
SEI YOUNG KIM: What's the leader score?
Q. 18.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, 18.  It is too tough to score, chase the leaderboard.  Yeah, I like this position, but I try to -- whatever, yeah, I try to chase the leader.  But it seems like the leader tough to chase her, yeah.  But I try and do my best tomorrow.
Q. Will you play a little bit more aggressively?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I think pin position I can't play aggressive, so I just -- if I have a chance to be aggressive opportunities, I try to do that, but even if not, I just stay patient, and then, yeah, conservatively, yeah.
Q. How was the Olympic experience for you?  How did you enjoy being down in Rio?
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was a really good experience for me because, yeah, I was -- a long time I waited on that time, so I really wanted to win, get to a medal, but I couldn't yet.  But I had a good experience, but yeah, it is good.  Inbee Park, she's a good player, and I got a lot of inspiration.  Yeah, I just cheer her, and we had a really good time.
