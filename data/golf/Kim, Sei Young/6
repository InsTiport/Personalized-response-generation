 Q.  You've come out with a wonderful third-round score today, a 6-under 65.  Tell us, how did you string that together?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Today I got a good vibe on the course, and then the course today played easier because the par-5s were a little closer than yesterday, so it's easier to reach the green.  Yeah, so that's why I played good today.   
 Q.  Today you played very well, but you mentioned you were working on your swing, and that's why you didn't play so good in the first round.  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, first round and the second round I was struggling with my swing, but now today I wasn't 100 percent, but like 70 percent.  But my caddie gave me good information to help me, so it's good synergy.  We are a good team.   
 Q.  You've had a great season so far, two wins, eight top 10s.  How did you feel coming into the Evian Championship?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Before Evian, I prepared, practiced for this tournament, because I really wanted to win this tournament.  That's the reason why -- I've put in my game (indiscernible), but yeah, I do my best tomorrow.   
 Q.  Last year you came close second at the Women's PGA Championship.  Do you feel like you are coming closer?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: I don't feel like leader, but almost catch the top 5, yeah.  I have a chance.  That's my goal.
