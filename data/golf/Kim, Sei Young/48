SEI YOUNG KIM:   Just on the last hole.  
   
 Q.   You didn't look at it until the last hole?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I didn't look until the last hole.

 Q.   Talk about the way you performed in the playoff.

 Q.   How did you make an adjustment to playing in the weather conditions here?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I have a lot of experience because it's really windy in Korea where I play.   
   
 Q.   What does this mean to you?   
SEI YOUNG KIM:   I joined the LPGA in hopes of making the Korean Olympics team, and this is one step towards that, so this means a lot to me.
