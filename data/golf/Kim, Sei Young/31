SEI YOUNG KIM: Well, this is really my 12th year, and I feel that actually being here makes me a bit nervous, because in my eyes, this is the toughest course I've ever played.  Overall, I'm happy with my performance, although I feel this is really, really tough.   
Tomorrow, if anyone can get any eagles, then this person could be walking away with the trophy.   
 Q.  (If this is the hardest course you've ever played, what is the next hardest)?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Of course, as far as the second toughest-course, I would say that would be the one in my home country, Korea, Hanwha.  That would be the one that could be ranked as No. 2 hardest.  Although there, when I was there, I actually won the championship title.   
Regarding the possibility of winning the Rookie of the Year, I'm competing with my fellow players from my country, but it depends how I do here; and if I win the title tomorrow, probably could secure the title of Rookie of the Year for this season.   
 Q.  (Do you change your strategy tomorrow being tied for the lead)?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: It won't make too much difference as far as the co-leaders, because I will walk out to start my last day here was one of the co-leaders, not like today where I was the leader.  Of course, technique means a lot tomorrow.  If my technique is good, then I will be able to probably get some good results.   
 Q.  (What hole is playing the easiest)?  
SEI YOUNG KIM: Overall, among the 18 holes, perhaps No. 14 is relatively easier than the rest.  The rest actually are all difficult, very hard to play.   
 Q.  (On tae kwan do training).  
SEI YOUNG KIM: In my ten years of tae kwan do training really helped me quite a bit.  As I got older, I feel the sport is a bit dangerous, more dangerous than golf, so I switched to golf, and golf to me is more interesting.
