Q. Tell us how your day went.
SEI YOUNG KIM: Today pretty steady, but I got stung by bee.  I feel little pain and kept the ice on it.
Q. Where did it get you, on your right hand?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Here.
Q. Oh, wow.
SEI YOUNG KIM: It was weird.
Q. Did it mess up your grip for a while?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Just for two hole.  Yeah, two hole.
Then I call and they gave my medicine.  Yeah, it was better.
Q. How is the course?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Course little different than last year.  Little changes couple holes.
Yeah, was not bad.  Yeah.  Good for me.  Reachable the par-5.
Yeah.
Q. Very nice conditions today, especially early I would imagine.  Good greens?
SEI YOUNG KIM: Yeah, greens are very pure, so it was I think faster than when I practice.  So the first couple holes I hitting too strong, and then that's the reason why I made a bogey at hole 12.  Yeah.
