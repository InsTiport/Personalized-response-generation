SEI YOUNG KIM: Oh, yeah.  I played good today.  First nine I little miss the par so I got two 3 putt.  Yeah.

Yeah, I played good today.
Q. What do you try to focus on in this wind to stay steady?
SEI YOUNG KIM: I like to play windy, because if into the wind I can hit the (indiscernible) shot.  Even if the left to right wind, my nature fly right hook, so it's easy today.  Yeah, so very comfortable today.
Q. You feel like it was to your advantage a little bit?
