   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in here.  
 CASIE CATHREA: Any time.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Just talk about how it felt today and how you're doing right now.  
 CASIE CATHREA: I'm feeling pretty good. It went okay today. I had a hole-in-one on No. 12. I hit a 5-iron. I didn't really know it went in until my caddie talked to me about it. It was a car hole, and I can't get the car.   
 But mostly it was really good, like having a couple of Blackhawk staff and a whole bunch of members out there watching me.  
 JASON TAYLOR: When you got the hole-in-one, how exciting was that?   
 CASIE CATHREA: It was pretty exciting because it was my third one. It was just really good, because this is my first LPGA event and I'm 13. So it was my first hole-in-one on the tour.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Pretty cool.  
 CASIE CATHREA: Yeah.  
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. Questions.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CASIE CATHREA: I was pretty excited. I wasn't actually like hyped up until I got to the golf course and I knew I was finally here. But mostly I just really wanted to play with, like, the tour people out here and see what they do differently than I do so that I could learn from what they do.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CASIE CATHREA: It was actually on the tenth tee when Tim Burditt, the head pro here on the lake side brought a whole bunch of members, and they were cheering me on and making signs. That was pretty exciting for me.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CASIE CATHREA: Yeah, because the jitters -- not jitters, but nerves had gone away. After that, I just felt fine. Like a normal first tee or a USGA tournament.  
  
  Q. Did you watch LPGA tournaments this year?  
 CASIE CATHREA: Not recently because I've been traveling and I've had school and matches. Like when I had free time, like between the publics and the junior girls and the amateur, if I could, if there was anything on, I would probably switch to it.  
  
  Q. After the times you did watch it on TV, to be out here playing with them, how did that feel?   
 CASIE CATHREA: It felt awesome. Like I finally made it to where I could play with my idols, like Lorena and Natalie. I actually met Pat Hurst and Juli Inkster on Tuesday when I came out here.   
 And they were just really nice. They were saying, If you have any questions, find me and I'll answer them for you. Or like I'll find them and I'll just talk to them and just say Hi. How did you play? Good luck, and all that sort of stuff.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CASIE CATHREA: My putting was actually working pretty good for me, and so was my driver. It was just some of the chips that I had, like on the eighth hole I could have got the chip a little closer. But I missed my landing spot by about three inches.   
  
  Q. What do you think the best part of your golf game is?   
 CASIE CATHREA: Well, there's sort of two right now: My driving and my putting. Because I was putting really good the first a little bit.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CASIE CATHREA: Yeah, it actually did. Like, all I wanted to do was make par or birdie and I knew they would still clap, even though I wasn't on tour for very long.   
 But mostly it was pretty cool because I knew a lot of people in the crowd and they knew me.   
 Mostly I was just like waving to the people that I knew. Even if I was waving, I would wave at nobody I knew, so...   
  
  Q. What has been the best moment of this week so far?   
 CASIE CATHREA: My hole-in-one. (Laughter.) Actually, the 18th hole, when was in the bunker I hit an 8-iron to about two or three feet and I made the birdie putt in front of the clubhouse, in front of everybody.   
 It was about 120, yeah.  
  
  Q. This is your third hole-in-one?   
 CASIE CATHREA: Yes.  
  
  Q. When were the first two?   
 CASIE CATHREA: The first one was the first time I tried the Junior World in San Diego. I don't remember the course. It wasn't a very good course. That's all I remember.  
 The second one was at Brookside on No. 3. It was about 123, and I hit an 8-iron.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in.   
 CASIE CATHREA: Thank you for having me.
