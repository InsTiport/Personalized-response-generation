  Q. Who you did you finish up today?  
 FRED GIBSON: I played a little better today. I thought it was better. The weather was better. But course is just too hard. It's too hard for me. I mean, those guys are not having the best of time either.  
  
  Q. Was it pin locations or putting it in the rough?  
 FRED GIBSON: Well rough obviously, it's so deep. And my wrist hurt, my shoulder hurt from trying to get it out of there. But I shouldn't be in there is, I guess.   
  
  Q. What did you learn over the last four days playing at Oak Hill?  
 FRED GIBSON: What did I learn? The course is too hard for me. I'm too old, buddy, I'm 62 years old.
