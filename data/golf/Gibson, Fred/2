  Q. So you started off the first nine pretty strong, with a couple birdies, did you change anything between the first nine and the second nine?  
 FRED GIBSON: No, the golf course changed. The hole moved.   
  
  Q. Okay. So how was the course overall throughout the first round?  
 FRED GIBSON: It's very difficult. You have to put it in the fairway here and then you have to hit the right spot on the green, because the greens are very severe, they weren't built for this speed.   
 But they're fair and if you hit it in the right spot you can make a lot of putts.  
  
  Q. Now you had some previous back problems, did you feel any of that today?  
 FRED GIBSON: No, I just got tired. I'm tired. Obviously walking a long time and I've been competing for a long time, but my back is fine now. I had surgery and it's fine.
