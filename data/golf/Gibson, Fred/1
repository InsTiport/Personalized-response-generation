 Q. How was your experience here at Colorado Golf Club?
 FRED GIBSON: For my age it was very difficult. My throat's still sore and I'm having trouble breathing up these hills, but I made it. I didn't play very well, so it's not the conditioning of the course, it's just me playing bad. 

 Q. Was the altitude a big affect for you?
 FRED GIBSON: Yeah. I was here early, just to try to get used to it, because I've been at altitude before and I know how it works. And I tried to get here and do the right things, but it still, just at 63 years old, I don't think I can handle this much atmosphere.
