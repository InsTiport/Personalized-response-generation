 Q. Just talk about your round today. 
 FREDDY GIBSON: It started off okay. Then it got a little funky there in the middle of the round. But other than that I played pretty good. I had -- I think I was like 5-over through middle of the round and ended up with 7-over. So it was pretty good. 
 Course is tough and playing hard and rough you can't get out of, so. But maybe tomorrow will be a little better.

 Q. How did the weather contribute to your game today?
 FREDDY GIBSON: It started out it was just cold this morning, there wasn't any rain, so it was fine. And I got off to a good start, but then late in the middle of the round it started getting a little rainy, a little colder, and I just didn't handle it very well. But then it cleared up and then I played better. So right in the middle of the round it was kind of plenty tough for me.

 Q. Caddie said that you had a tough time on 17. That was a pretty tough hole. 
 FREDDY GIBSON: Yeah, yeah. It was a little wet and damp and then it just, I just hit, I hit a good tee shot in the middle of the fairway, which is the hardest part of the hole, really, and just hit a terrible 3-iron and then skulled it in the back bunker, buried it and 3-putted it. 
 So it was just, that was kind of set the tone for the next few holes. And then I settled down and played pretty well. So maybe tomorrow I'll do a little better.

 Q. Better weather tomorrow they say?
 FREDDY GIBSON: That's what they say. In the afternoon, right?
