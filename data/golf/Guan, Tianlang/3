 Q.   Congratulations.   How did you feel about the round overall?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   I feel pretty good today.   Could be better.   I missed a couple of birdie putts in the middle but overall not a bad round.   
   
 Q.   First hole you hit it right down the middle of the fairway and you might have had a 10‑footer for birdie so you didn't show any nerves, didn't seem to show any nerves.   
TIANLANG GUAN:   After The Masters and New Orleans, I still feel nervous on the first tee but not too much, and I handle it pretty good in the middle fairway and kept it going.  
  
Q.Did you feel support from the‑‑ seemed like you had a good gallery out here, did you feel their support?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   Yeah, but not much on the course.   But thrilled they come here and watching me.   I'll be doing well tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Do you talk at all with the guys you're with?   Obviously they're a lot older than you.   I know you're focused but do you talk at all?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   We have a little talk sometimes when we was waiting.   But we had some rules problems today so we need to pick up speed.   
  
 Q.   So you had what problem?  
TIANLANG GUAN:   A lot of rules problems.  
   
 Q.   Did they put you on the clock today?  
TIANLANG GUAN:   Couple holes but I think we were playing pretty good time but just wait for the rule.   
   
 Q.   You were never in any danger?  
TIANLANG GUAN:   No.   
   
 Q.   Because to me it looked like you were playing fast.   
TIANLANG GUAN: Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Have you made a conscious effort to pick up your pace?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   A little bit of change but not much, still normal play.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you're in good shape to make the cut?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   I feel like I have a pretty good chance.   
   
 Q.   I saw your mom passing snacks to you.   What kind of things do you eat during the round?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   Bananas, something.
