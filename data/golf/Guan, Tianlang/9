Q.   What can you say about the course as the week went on?   Did it get easier for you? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   No, it's actually the most difficult course in the world.   I don't think it was getting easier, it was getting more and more difficult, actually.   To me every single shot is difficult.   Actually because I don't hit it that far, it's kind of a long course for me.   It's very difficult to save some putts.   If you make a mistake it is so difficult for you. 

Q.   How has this week changed your life? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I didn't really think about that.   I was just following my own game.   I love golf, and I want to continue playing golf. 

Q.   What would you like to do in the next few years in terms of accomplishments and other tournaments and tours? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   It's up to me.   I have my own ideas and my own opinions.   I want to play where I can get more opportunities, and it's totally up to me.

Q.   Will it be the plan to finance future events and trips? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I'm free to play in China.   All tournaments in China for juniors are free.
