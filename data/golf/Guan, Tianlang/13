  TIANLANG GUAN:   I need to see a yardage book again and probably switch clubs on the 17th, but unfortunately that's my second bad time.

Q.   Have you been assessed a penalty? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I respect the decision they make.

Q.   What was the decision? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   One‑stroke penalty on the 17th.   I think they should do it with respect to everybody.

Q.   What was your reaction when they did that?   Were you emotional about it? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I think a little bit on the 17th green and I didn't make that par putt, but on the 18th I think I did a pretty good job, saved the par, so I still have a chance.

Q.   What would you think if the penalty keeps you from making the cut now? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   You mean if the penalty made me miss the cut?   I think it's still a great week for me.   I enjoy it so far, and I learned a lot. 

Q.   How important is it for you to make the cut? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   If I can make it I would be really happy for it, but if I didn't make it, it's still a great week.

Q.   What have you learned about playing faster? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I think I just changed my routine before the Masters, and the routine is good, but I think today is pretty hard because if you're timed only 40 seconds, it's pretty hard because you need to make the decision.   The wind switched a lot.   But that's for everybody. 

Q.   Do you think you were the only one who was playing slow today? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   I don't know what they do, but I don't think I'm too bad. 

Q.   Do you agree with the penalty?
TIANLANG GUAN:   Yes.

Q.   Was communication with your caddie a problem?
TIANLANG GUAN:   No, I don't think it's a problem.   A gust of wind and everything here is not that easy. 

Q.   Were you trying to speed up after they gave you a warning earlier in the round? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   A little bit, but I think my routine is good.   The only problem is I have to make the decision.

Q.   Do you know why it took so long between the time you finished and the time you came out?   Were you trying to dissuade the committee?   Were you trying to make them take the penalty away? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   Not that, just want to know why they're going to do that, and they told me‑‑ I just learned a lot from them, and they told me how to keep it faster or whatever. 

Q.   Did you understand when they warned you at first, did you understand that it could be a stroke penalty? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   When were you warned?
TIANLANG GUAN:   13, and that one is‑‑ yeah, the wind changed.

Q.   Were you warned on the front nine? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   No. 

Q.   How many times altogether were you warned? 
TIANLANG GUAN:   Just one, and the second one is the stroke penalty. 

Q.   On the tee at 16, was that switching clubs because of the wind?
TIANLANG GUAN:   Yeah, that's true.

Q.   That's exactly what you're talking about?
TIANLANG GUAN:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Did you ever know you had a 40‑second time?
TIANLANG GUAN:   Yeah, I know that for sure, but I have to change clubs if the wind gusts.   When I stand on the tee and I see Matteo hit the ball in the water, it's really strong into the wind.   When I stand on the tee and the wind kind of calmed down, it's like a little helping.

Q.   When did the rules official tell you that you had a penalty?
TIANLANG GUAN:   On 17? 

Q.   Yes. 
TIANLANG GUAN:   He just let me see the‑‑
THE INTERPRETER:   Stopwatch.
TIANLANG GUAN:   And I just told him that when I was at the ball, and he said yes.
