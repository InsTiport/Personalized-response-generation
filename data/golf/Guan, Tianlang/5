 Q.   Little bit of a different day to day?  
TIANLANG GUAN:   Oh, yeah, little bit different.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your round?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   I didn't do pretty good.   When I started, I didn't have a good start, and I tried to start back at the middle and made a couple birdies.   
But it was not a very good round though.  
   
 Q.   Are you disappointed by today's round?   
TIANLANG GUAN:   A little bit, but I still have some chance.   I will be doing good tomorrow.
