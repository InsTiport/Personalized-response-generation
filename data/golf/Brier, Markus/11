MARKUS BRIER:  We tried to qualify for this event in Mexico and just missed out by three shots.  Then I think it was about three days later, we were told by the European Tour that we were in the field when someone withdrew, I think it was Thailand.

We were obviously feeling a bit disappointed, but to come here and to shoot 60 is kind of a dream score.  We've both had our ups and downs this year, but it all came together today.
MARTIN WIEGELE:  It was great.  I've struggled this season and lost my card, then I was pretty disappointed to miss out at the second stage of the qualifying school.

So this was awesome today.  I've only been a pro for about two years and had a very good season last year on the Challenge Tour.  Maybe I wasn't quite mature enough for the European Tour.  Next year I'll go back on the Challenge Tour, and hopefully in two year's time, I will be mature enough to play on the main tour again.
Q.  Was it expensive to go to Mexico?
MARKUS BRIER:  It wasn't too bad.  We managed to find a sponsor from the flights from the Austrian Federation and the hotel was paid for by the organizers.

But even without that help we would have gone anyway.  It's once in a year chance and we wanted to qualify for this event.  We expected to go to the qualifier in Malaysia rather than Mexico, but the Federation said we had to go to Mexico.  And in any case it worked out to our advantage in that we were able to get back from the event which finished on a Saturday to play in the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland.  If we had gone to Malaysia, we could not have done that.

That arrangement worked out better for us, and I suppose it was good that we had the chance to practice foursomes and four-balls in the prequalifier and have the chance to get used to this format.
