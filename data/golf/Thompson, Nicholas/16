 Q. How are you leaving Glen Abbey? Good thoughts confidence? 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: You know, I've been playing good the last couple of weeks. I played well this week. I had one bad hole over 36 holes. I could have made some more putts. But all in all, 11 under, I played well. 

 Q. FedExCup is down the road a bit, but still it's creeping up in showings like this. Are you thinking about that? Where you want to get the higher seeding and so on? 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Of course, it's always nice to make as many points as you can. To secure yourself in as many FedExCup tournaments as you can. 
 It's often nice to accumulate as many points to play well in the FedExCup and get through the championship and keep on going. 

 Q. How difficult was it for you to play out there while maybe, were you getting updates, I guess, about your sister? You were not. When did you find out? 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: I had the update that she was 2 up through 17. That's when I went out to the range. I just found out in the scoring tent. Called my dad and found out she won 5 to 4.

 Q. How do you feel about that? 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: She's the first USGA Champion in our family. It's the greatest thing ever.

 Q. Are you going to call her? 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: I just talked to her in the tent. I told her congratulations. That's awesome. And she is the first USGA Champion in our family.
