  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: You know, I mean, I played well. I made eight birdies, two bogeys, very stupid bogeys. But bogeys are always stupid.   
 I played well. I hit my irons extreme think well. I put in a new set of RAZR X Callaway irons. Changed my putter this week. Rolled it really well with a Callaway Black Ox putter.   
 You know, I mean, those seem to be the two differences in the game. I mean, I just played really well, solid golf.  
  
  Q. What have you been struggling with this year? Is it your putting?   
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Combination of everything. One thing one week, one thing the next week. I drove it pretty good. But if you get slightly away, just manageable in the rough itself. I hit my irons really well. My proximity to the hole today had to be pretty good.   
  
  Q. The rest of the year, think you're in the 150 range right now, are you thinking about that out there or trying to get your game in order?  
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: Of course, it's in the back of your mind. You just got to go out there and play as well as you can, whether you're 150, 125, top 10 on the money. You sign up for the tournament, you go there to play as well as you can no matter where you are.
