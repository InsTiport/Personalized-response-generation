 Q. Talk about your day and your week. 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: You know, I played solid golf this week. I played six, nine holes of good golf, two nine holes of very poor golf. The six nine holes were 6-under, and the two nine holes were ten over. 
 I mean, I played good. I played 16, 17, 18 really good. 16, I put four perfect drives in the fairway and hit two 7-irons, a 4-iron and a 9-iron in. I hit the green all four days on 17, and hit the fairway three days on 18. 
 So, I mean, I played the last three holes really well out here, at 2-under. So I think anybody would take 2-under on 16, 17 and 18 and never play them through the week.

 Q. As far as your 33 on the back side, maybe just talk about that, with the conditions and gusts up to 40. 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: I played really good. I hit a driver and a 3-iron into 11 to about 30 feet, 2-putted that. 
 I hit a driver and a 9-iron into 16 and just came close from about 15 feet. 
 17, we all know, it was about 25 feet from the hole and I went to Mark it and a gust of wind moved the ball down to three feet, tapped that one in for a birdie. 
 I made a good saving par on 18. Otherwise I just hit a lot of good golf shots on the back nine.

 Q. Is 16 playing straight downwind?
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON: It's down and right-to-left. So while it's still kind of hard to hit that fairway, it's playing kind of nice, however that second shot coming in is blowing dead right-to-left in and it is tough to get it close to that pin.
