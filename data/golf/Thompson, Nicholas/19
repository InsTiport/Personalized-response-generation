 Q.  5 under par today (inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  You know what?  I mean, I played very solid.  I had six birdies, one bogey.  The one bogey was a 3-putt.  Every time I missed the green, I chipped it really close so it had a good chance of going in.  I just played solid.  I hit a lot of good drives, a lot of good putts, some missed here and there, but (inaudible). 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  No, I wouldn't say it got -- I mean, it's been windy all week, so, I mean, I don't think it's going to bake out that much different in the morning and afternoon.  It may be a little bit, ball stops a little bit more on the green, but, I mean, I didn't have much of a problem holding any shots today. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  You know what, I think it's great.  I mean, they have got the World Golf event, or the CA Championship over in Miami, and I think it's great to give the rest of the Tour another spot to play for the week. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  Well, I will tell you, the thing is, this is just a magnificent resort.  It's beautiful.  So that's always a plus.  And that will bring people back. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  You know what, I just hit a lot of good penetrating drives and a lot of short shots into the green, and reached number 18 in two, I reached 2, and I reached 5. 
 So, I mean, I am hitting on or beside all of those. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 NICHOLAS THOMPSON:  Yeah.  I mean, I performed good and bad this year at times.  It all kind of depends on -- I hit the ball pretty similar every week.  It kind of all depends on how the putter shows up. 
 And, I mean, while my hitting stats don't look as good as they are, I hit a lot of 15, 18-footers for birdie that are just on the fringe.  I tend to gun at a lot of pins.  So I know I end up on a lot of fringes on the short side, which is not a bad side to be, but it tends to (inaudible).
