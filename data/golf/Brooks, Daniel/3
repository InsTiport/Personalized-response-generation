Q. Give us your verdict on a lovely match beating the top seed.
DANIEL BROOKS: It was good fun.  I played some nice golf early on.  Got a few up early on Chris, which obviously coming around the turn, 6-up, always a bit of a bonus.  Gives me a bit more room on the back nine but he started playing well on the back nine and got it back a bit.
Q. I appreciate you were playing well but were you surprised to be that far ahead?
DANIEL BROOKS: I played well yesterday, as well.  Obviously Chris wasn't playing that great early doors and obviously I took advantage of that and got quite a few up.
Q. What are your thoughts when he chips away at that lead?
DANIEL BROOKS: I knew it was going to come at some point.  He couldn't keep hitting the shots he was hitting, and he pulled some back.  He hit some nice ones and then I made a few pars where I could have possibly made a couple of birdies.  It was getting a bit tense down the last few holes.
Q. Does that mean there's a sense of relief, as well as satisfaction?
DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, definitely.  Even gave it a go on the last when he nearly holed his bunker shot there and he lipped out.  No, it was a good game.
Q. You seem to like this coastline.  You played pretty well down the road at Gullane, didn't you?
DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, I had a good year last year around here, a couple good events around here.  I enjoy it down here.
Q. Are you enjoying match play?
DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, it's good fun.  Makes a change.  Definitely good fun.
