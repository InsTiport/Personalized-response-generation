Q. Late but great.DANIEL BROOKS: It's been a long one, you know.  Mooching around all morning.Q. What do you do when you have a 3.40 tee-off time?DANIEL BROOKS: Slept in until about 9.00, slow breakfast.  Just everything was slow this morning.  Got up here at one o'clock, a bit of lunch and chilled out even more.  Sort of started getting going around a quarter past two.Q. So nice and relaxed for your tee off?DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, might have helped.  You never like going out that late, but it's been a good day in the end.Q. Pretty sweet when you shoot a 64.  Tell me about your round a little bit?DANIEL BROOKS: Just played really solid.  Last couple of weeks, I've started playing better and better, and just a bit more confident really.  Feel like I'm swinging it really nice again.  I'm sort of hitting the shots that should be hitting.  Putting fairly nice.  It's been quite an easy day really.Q. Thoughts on Gullane?  Good golf course?DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, lovely track.  First time here.  Quite pleasant.  A bit soft for a links course at the moment but nothing you can do about that.Q. Are you a links lover?DANIEL BROOKS: I am actually.  You play a lot as an amateur.  Weren't really linksy today.  Maybe a club and a half wind, two-club at max.  It was good fun.
