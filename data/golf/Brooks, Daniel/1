Q. Daniel, an opening 68 here in Italy.  How pleased are you with that?
DANIEL BROOKS: It was nice.  I've been struggling a bit lately so to get around 4-under in the first round is a nice start.
Q. Any birdies stand out for you?
DANIEL BROOKS: I hit quite a lot of good shots today which is nice to see.  Hit a scabby 9-iron early on and made double into the par 3.  Other than that, I didn't really hit many bad shots.  It was a nice, steady round.
Q. Two very different nines, very hilly on the back nine.  Which is the better scoring nine?
DANIEL BROOKS: They are both similar.  If you can get them both in play, there's quite a few short irons out there and the par 5s are quite scorable if you keep it in play.  Overall, pretty similar.
Q. In terms of a Rolex Series Event, a good performance this week would be a nice way to kick start the rest of the season?
DANIEL BROOKS: I struggled early this season and feel like my game is slowly coming together.  Had a bad injury early doors, as well.  Need a good finish in all of them, really.
