Q. Got to be very happy with that start?
DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, a good, steady start.  I played some nice golf out there.
Q. How were conditions?
DANIEL BROOKS: Tough.  Wind was opposite to last year.  All the scoring holes last year, they were the tougher holes this year.  It was a good test.  A lot of long irons into some par 4s and it's quite tricky because the wind was either into off the left or down off the right.  You had to control your ball quite well.
Q. And this week is one of the more enjoyable ones, I would imagine?
DANIEL BROOKS: Yeah, the weather is nice.  It's windy, but it's sunny so you can't ask for more.  All the courses are in really good condition this year, and as long as the rain is held away, it will be a nice day.
Q. Thoughts on your season overall?
DANIEL BROOKS: It's been nice and steady.  I haven't made quite a lot of cuts this year but general I've always had one round let me down, or not even-round, but a few holes here and there.  But quite a steady season, yeah.
