  Q. Give me a brief description of your round today?  
 RALPH WEST: Inconsistent. Didn't hit the ball very solid today. A lot of scrambling. I only hit four or five greens today. Seven greens total. So very up-and-down. I got up-and-down out of the rough three or four times. I probably shouldn't have, but. Putted decent.   
 This is one of those days where I just didn't hit the ball very solid and it got me in too much trouble.  
  
  Q. Did the wind or the weather have any affect on your round?  
 RALPH WEST: I'm sure the weather did. It was cold and I was not quite as loose as I probably would be. The wind on the back nine had some affect. It was blowing a little bit harder, I think.  
  
  Q. What do you have to do tomorrow to improve?  
 RALPH WEST: Figure out how to hit the ball a little more solid. Hit some more greens. Those are my main focus I'm going to work on this afternoon and tomorrow morning.
