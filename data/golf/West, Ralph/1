  Q. How was your round two today, sir?  
 RALPH WEST: Better than yesterday. Didn't get off to a very good start, but played pretty solid in the middle of the round and kind of struggled back on the front side again.  
  
  Q. How about this tournament, what can you take away from the Colorado Golf Club?  
 RALPH WEST: The golf course is pretty good. Unfortunately, the conditions were tough because of all the wind. But overall the golf course and the conditions were great.   
  
  Q. Did the elevation play a factor for you?  
 RALPH WEST: Yeah, it didn't bother us as much as I thought it would. Physically it probably bothers me a little bit, because it's a hard walk, there's some pretty good climbs out there.
