TYLER STRAFACI:   You're standing over a putt and the ball was going back and forth and you're just trying to gain your balance, and you're like, I don't want to step off this ball because it's going to do the same thing again so you just end up hitting it.  I made a really good putt on 14.  That was just hit and hope at that point.  15, 70 feet.  But I'm going to regroup.  I'm playing really good.  I've played some great players over the last two days, and they've played great.  I know if I play solid one shot at a time I'm going to have a shot, I'm going to be in every match.
Q. Tell me what you were thinking about heading into tomorrow.
TYLER STRAFACI:   Yeah, it's just a very weird feeling, obviously.  I feel bad for Segundo.  He wasn't a part of it, and he played phenomenal.  He really fought hard.  He was 2-down, he brought it back, and that last hole, it could have gone either way because it's blowing 30, I was putting, he's got not that hard a bunker shot, so it could have gone either way.  I could have three-putted, he could have -- it's just weird right now.  But we both played very solid and it was very competitive and fun.  I was laughing the whole time because it was just brutal conditions.  Very fair but brutal.
Q. How do you put it out of your mind and really get your head going tomorrow?
TYLER STRAFACI:   I've just got to just get some sleep and forget about it.  The only thing I'm taking out is I played great against a really good player and I happened to beat him.  I guess I'm going to take it as that.  Yeah, I'm going to hold my head high and go out tomorrow and play well.
