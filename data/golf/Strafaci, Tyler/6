  TYLER STRAFACI:   I didn't see it touch the sand or whatnot, but my dad saw it and I guess a couple other people saw it.
 Q. Oh, wow, he can't do that.
 TYLER STRAFACI:   That was one of the best matches I've ever played, just back and forth.  He's a great kid.
 Q. They've got it on camera.
 TYLER STRAFACI:   He played great, we both played great, and for that to happen, I feel really bad for him.
 Q. Well, you're a real gentleman for how you competed.  I can see in your face how much you're hurting for your opponent.  How do you put this aside now tonight and get ready for tomorrow morning's matches?
 TYLER STRAFACI:   I want to make it worth something.  I'm going to go out tomorrow and try and win my match and keep moving.
 Q. There's a rich history of golf in your family; what would it mean to go along in this championship and ultimately play on Sunday?
 TYLER STRAFACI:   It would mean the world.  I'm just putting a lot of work toward it the past year.  I really struggled last year.  Over the past summer it's been really good to get some positive stuff going on, and if I happen to play well the next couple days, then it would just be the experience of a lifetime.
