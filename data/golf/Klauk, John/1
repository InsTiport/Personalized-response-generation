   JEFF KLAUK: Last couple months have been a little tough on the golf course, so I'll get it back. But I've got tomorrow, and the course played very easy today according to the way it's been in the past. So there are going to be a lot of low scores.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JEFF KLAUK: No, it's always good to have John on the bag. We have a good time. We talked a lot about a lot of different things and just try to keep it loose. And after you hit some bad shots where I haven't hit them in a long time on this golf course through all the times I've played it, you can only laugh about them.  
  
  Q. Have you had some chances at all? Did you have some chances?   
 JEFF KLAUK: Yeah, I had some chances. I missed a -- you always give yourself some chances during some rounds. But I didn't make the putts to keep the momentum going.  
 To say the least, very frustrated. But you know, I tried the hardest I could, and that's really all you can do.  
  
  Q. You said the course was playing easier. What are the things out there that makes it easier?   
 JEFF KLAUK: Well, there is very little wind, the greens are soft, and, you know, any time you don't have wind, I mean, it's going to make it, you know, not much rough either. The wind definitely makes courses harder.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about driving all over the place?   
 JEFF KLAUK: No, it's all over the place. I have an idea, so I'm going to go work on it.
