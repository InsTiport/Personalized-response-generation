Q. Talk about your round.  Obviously a lot of guys going low out there.S.J. PARK: Yeah, just really comfortable with my game.  Starting on the 1st hole, 2nd hole, it rained a little bit, but the weather came out really good.  I made a couple putts, and I was hitting it really good, so I was really comfortable with my shots.  Whatever I did, it worked out, and now I'm standing where I should be.  I think I'm going to really have fun tomorrow.Q. Do you plan to have a restless night or a good sleep tonight?  Will you be nervous at all?S.J. PARK: It's going to be the same.  I've had this situation before, been in this position, so it's always going to be the same.  It's going to be another round for me.  Hopefully I'll have a good dinner and a good sleep and play well tomorrow.Q. This golf course requires players to work the ball both directions, left and right.  Obviously the golf course fits your eye pretty well.  Are you pretty good at working the ball both directions, left and right?S.J. PARK: Yeah, I love to play left and right, and the course, it kind of suits me.  I like to play a lot of tree lines and stuff, and there are a lot of trees out here, and the area is really good.  I love to be out here, yeah.
