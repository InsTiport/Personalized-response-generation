Q. Well, 3-under 67.  Good day.  How much was it the wind for you today?
JIM HERMAN: Played about the same as yesterday.  It's a great golf course out there.  A lot of holes that are exposed so you got to do your best to control your golf ball.  Keeping it in the fairway is always the best way to get your ball on the green.
Going to look to do more of the same tomorrow.
Q. You got the ball in the fairway.  Ball-striking very good.  16 of 18 greens in the regulation.  Did have the one bogey, but you bounced back nicely with back-to-back birdies.
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, just got to work on my speeds on the greens.  Just leaving everything mostly short, so just got to keep my head still a little longer or give a little bit more.
I don't know if I'm moving or not giving it enough hit.  Just going to go hit a few putts and make sure we got that squared away for tomorrow and keep doing what I'm doing.
Q. Double digits.  You're certainly in the hunt.  What do you think will be the key tomorrow, that putting you just mentioned?
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, making a few putts.  Obviously it starts with the driver.  Keep the driver in play, get the ball in the fairway, and give myself some looks on the gree and get it to the hole.
Q. Through three rounds you're playing very well.  Keep it going.
JIM HERMAN: Thank you.
