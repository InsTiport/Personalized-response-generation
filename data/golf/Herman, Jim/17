 Q. Iron play, I thought was really good at least what I saw on the back-9. You must be pleased.  
JIM HERMAN: Very pleased. Really enjoyed my couple weeks off. I got some good practice in, worked with the short game but didn't have to rely on that too much. 17 greens, really hit the irons well today. Very pleased.  
   
 Q. How were course conditions? I know the fairways were a little soggy. You were able to clean the ball in the fairway. How did that help?  
JIM HERMAN: It's always nice when you don't get any mud on the balls. Just want to take advantage and get a good lie. You know, you're not going to have to worry about mud so very important to hit it in the fairway and take advantage of that.  
   
 Q. The greens are holding up really nice. Fairways are wet but the greens are really good.  
JIM HERMAN: These greens are the best, I don't know, we've played in a long time. Really enjoy playing bermuda grass. So, you know, they got them in great shape even though we had a lot of rain but great job by the superintendent.  
   
 Q. I wanted to ask you this because as I described your shots I always talk about the Trump logo on the shirt.   
Do you get reaction from the crowd because I know you used to work for Mr. Trump, get a reaction?  
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, definitely.  
   
 Q. Is it good?  
JIM HERMAN: Lot of positive reaction. He's done a great job. We'll see what happens in the next coming year with him. He's been on my side for a long time.  
   
 Q. That's really neat.  
JIM HERMAN: It is. It's very neat.
