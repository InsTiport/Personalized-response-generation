 Q.  Jim, nice round of golf today.  I looked at how many putts you had, 25 putts.  That is almost as good as your opening round 62.  What do you like about these greens?  It's just phenomenal watching you.  
JIM HERMAN: We had a good feel for the greens starting on Wednesday in the Pro-Am.  Felt really good there.  But difference between Thursday and today is I just hit the ball a lot closer.  I wasn't scrambling as much as I was today.  Just seemed like I had a lot of par putts and I was making them.  So very, very solid day and I'm very -- I wouldn't say fortunate but I played really hard to shoot 3-under par today.  It wasn't pretty but there's no pictures on the scorecard.  I'll take it and the guys behind us played really well.   
 Q.  Your family came out to watch and I heard from your caddie that you didn't know that they were coming.  
JIM HERMAN: I did not.  I was expecting to see them tomorrow in Orlando.  So that was very nice to see them on the 18th hole there.  It's good that they could come out.  They don't get to see me play.  They are usually in day care, the kids are.   Nice to see them on the golf course.   
 Q.  You scooted well up the FedEx points rankings, so a wise decision to play this week?  
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, it turned out really well.  I like playing in Florida, the Florida Swing.  I was just a little worn out from the West Coast, and like I said, with Honda, just a lot of family.  I was just looking for a couple weeks off.   
But you can't take weeks off when you feel like you're striking the ball well.  So definitely a good decision and look forward to Bay Hill next week.  It should be fun honoring the King and look forward to that.
