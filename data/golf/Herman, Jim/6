 Q.  You lose a little ground to Adam but a solid round of golf?  
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, even par, obviously lost a little ground to Adam.  He played a fantastic round of golf today, so hats off to him.  Just need to clean up a few things.  Not many bad shots, but just not getting the ball in the hole like day one.  But tomorrow is another day and looking forward to seeing what we can do.   
 Q.  The bounce back on 17, a little bit of momentum and ytou put a great swing on 18, too.  
JIM HERMAN: Yeah, I don't know what that was on 17.  I thought I made it there.  A great 5-iron on 17 and hit two really quality shots on 18 and hit a really good putt.  Just didn't go.
