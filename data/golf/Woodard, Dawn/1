Q. The oldest team moves on.  You guys have obviously experience enough and been through this drill a few times.  Is there any part of the match that was a key moment?  Seemed like it was nip and tuck the whole way.
MEGHAN STASI: It was.  It was worth a lot.  It was good to win on birdies, and they won on a couple birdies, we won on a few birdies, so that helped the match a lot.
Q. Was there one particular birdie you think was the difference?  You guys went ahead on 16; is that right?
MEGHAN STASI: 16 was a good one, yeah.  I made a putt there.
DAWN WOODARD: I made a long one on 15.  You made one on 16.
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, Dawn made a long, long putt on 15.
Q. 15 was for birdie?  How long was it?
MEGHAN STASI: All capital letters, L-O-N-G, long.
Q. So that put you 1-up?
DAWN WOODARD: That put us 1-up, and then Meghan birdied 16 to put us 2-up dormie.
Q. And then they won 17?
DAWN WOODARD: They won 17.
MEGHAN STASI: So yeah, there was just a lot of great birdies out there.
DAWN WOODARD: We birdied 12, but they birdied 13.
Q. Is this the farthest you guys have gotten in this event, the quarters?
DAWN WOODARD: Quarters.
Q. Well, you guys won't have to play the medalists.  They're done.
MEGHAN STASI: Oh, they did lose?
DAWN WOODARD: At this point, everybody can play golf.  I mean, there's no -- and in a four-ball format, too, it's who covers for who and who makes a putt here and there.  There's not anybody left that can't go low on any given day or you can have a bad day.
Q. What suits you guys best with four-ball?  What makes you guys such a good team?
MEGHAN STASI: Well, we're usually helping each other out.
DAWN WOODARD: I think more than anything it's experience because we just don't --
MEGHAN STASI: We don't have to think like a lot of these kids.  They've never played this, this format, so it's like more stress and pressure on figuring out who's away, who's --
Q. You guys understand the strategy?
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, we don't have to think about that.
DAWN WOODARD: And they get the chance to have people helping them.  So for them, it's almost like information overload, and we're just playing golf.  I think that's an advantage to a certain extent.
