Q.   Tell me how the course played today and how you approached it and how you feel after your round. 
  BOB GILDER:   Well, I think most of the holes were pretty playable.   I think 4 and 7 were some horrible pins with the wind conditions.   They knew it was windy this morning and you put a pin where you got no place to land it and you got the wind blowing downwind, or side wind, there's no room there.   I think those were silly pins.   Absolutely silly.   They should know better. 
  But I think that I hit the ball well today, with the exception of a couple of‑‑ I hit a couple of marginal shots, and it cost me.   I 3‑putted once, but other than that it was a good round. 
  I hit the ball pretty solid most of the day and was pretty happy with it.   Sometimes you hit it good and end up not so good scoring wise on a course like this.   And that was kind of what you do. 
  It's just a matter of where the ball ends up on these greens sometimes whether you get a decent putt at it or not.
Q.   Getting to play in the morning tomorrow, do you feel good about where you are?
  BOB GILDER:   Well, I don't know, 29th place?   I guess if it blows ‑‑ you never know what's going to happen tomorrow, where they're going to put the pins and that.   So we'll just have to see.
