Q.  Take me through your round today, that's quite a score you posted out there.
BOB GILDER:  Well, I was just very happy to be here today.

I ended up in the hospital last night, getting a kidney stone operation.  I had a stent put in.  And I was just very happy to be here today.

But, so it was just pretty much a battle out there.  I was just not trying to over swing and I hit some really good shots out there.  And I only had a chance for bogey a couple of times.  And I bogeyed this last hole.  But the other time I made a good putt.  So I don't know how to understand it.  I mean, you know, you play great one day and nothing goes right the other day and it's just one of those days that went right.  I needed it and I'm just happy I'm here.
Q.  How were the conditions out there?  I know yesterday the wind kicked up.  Was it all right, was it conducive to scoring a little bit out there today?
BOB GILDER:  Well, you know, it came up and went down a little bit.  You get some lulls.  But then it would come up and gust on you a little bit.  I thought it was going to be a little more steady than it was today.  I don't think it was as tough as it started out to be.

It didn't really materialize into something really, you know, strong and just steady.  It was kind of up and down.
