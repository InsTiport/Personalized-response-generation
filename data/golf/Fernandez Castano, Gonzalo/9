 Q.   Keeping last week's good run going?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     It's been a good start.   It's been a good start.   I played again very, very solid golf tee‑to‑green.   I left myself a lot of birdie chances and minus five to start the tournament is a pretty good result considering the circumstance.   It was windy out there and there's some tricky pin positions.   Overall very, very happy with my performance.  
   
 Q.   Solid golf but you then caught fire on the back nine.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I did.   Funny enough, I missed a very short birdie putt on the second hole, which was my 11th.   Missed another couple of chances on the third and the fourth, and then out of the blue, came four straight birdies, which made a good round into a very good one.   
   
 Q.   Might just be my addled memory but I have recollections of you doing this kind of thing before, keeping it going week‑after‑week?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, I've done that in the past and hopefully I can keep doing it this week but it's a very good tournament.   We have a very, very strong field again, and there's still 54 holes to go, so hopefully I can keep playing well and we'll see on Sunday what happens.  
   
 Q.   Energy levels, they are good?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Energy levels are pretty good.   I was feeling a little tired on Tuesday.   But I guess it's normal after all the adrenaline rush on Sunday and Monday.   Takes a while to recover and Tuesday I was feeling a little bit tired, but I wasn't in the Pro‑Am yesterday, so I took a good rest and I'm feeling 100 percent again.
