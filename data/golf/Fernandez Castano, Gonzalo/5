  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Welcome, thanks for joining us.   Delighted to welcome a member of each of the winning teams today and starting at the top of the order, take us through your match, you played sensational golf today. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, Miguel played great.   He had like three or four birdie chances where he made birdie and he was amazing.   I was there when he needed me but he played great.   Yeah, it was great and it was super playing. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I think it was a little bit the same story.   Thomas played some solid golf, and hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and made it quite easy for me to walk around.   I played all right the last couple of holes but it was mainly Thomas.   But we got the point.
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I think we played all right, we played consistent.   We made birdies on different holes so there was not a hole that we made both birdie on so that really helped.   Yeah, I think we played some solid golf. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Gonzalo, not a bad start, holing out.
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     Yeah, doesn't get much better than that.   I think we were 6‑under after six and probably the turning point was the 10th hole where they had a chance to get back to only 1‑down but fortunately for us they missed the putt and we went on to win the match. 
So I think we played very solid both of us. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Jamie, opposite start for you guys. 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Yeah, we had a slow start.   We had five pars which was quite slow.   But after that, Graeme holed a good couple of putts on the front nine and he birdied 6,8 and 9 and after that I played well and we dovetailed really well to close out the match on 17. 

Q.   Are you thinking a whitewash for the whole tournament? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   We have had a very good day today.   To be five‑nil up is a fantastic start.   We have always said during practice that we simply can't underestimate our opponents because the end of the day, we are playing in Malaysia, it's so hot and the courses favor them.   We just had a very good day today and we have to not get complacent, get out tomorrow and continue to play well and not take it for granted, although we have had a very good start. 

Q.   You played with the local favorite here, what did you make of his game and the way he played today? 
JAMIE DONALDSON:   Kim, he started great.   They could have been sort of 4‑up I think quite early on in the first five holes.   Yeah, they opened up really good.   We came into our own towards the end of the front nine and played very strong the back nine to just close out the match.   But we had to play very well to beat them after what was a very strong start from their side. 

Q.   The Indian boys in particular are playing quite well, quite a few birdies but still, the despite was so one‑sided.   Was it the inexperience in match play that showed? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     I think the score and the result doesn't show how close the match was.   As I said, we had a very good start leading 6‑under after six holes, and even though we were only 4‑up at the time.   They had chances on the eighth and they had chances on the ninth and also the 10th.   But lucky for us, we went on to make birdies on 11 and 12 and then we went 3‑up which is a pretty good margin.   I think that they didn't play probably as good as they normally do and we played pretty solid.   We made a lot of birdies and definitely we were 9‑under for 14 holes and that's always very good. 

Q.   Can you talk us through the eagle, when it went in, did you think this was going to be a special day, not just for you but for Europe?   Was it good for confidence? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     Absolutely.     Couldn't ask for any better.   At the time I was on my own at the hole because Stephen had 260 and he was blocked so he had to chip it back to the fairway.   It was a tricky pin position on the first.   The pin was on the right and I had the perfect yardage, but I knew I had to hit a good 9‑iron to get it there and that's exactly what I did. 
We heard the cheers on the green that there were not that many people around, so we were not really sure what had happened.   We just found out when we got to the top of the hill and as you said, I think our birdie was a premonition of what a fantastic day it was for The European Team. 

Q.   What was the yardage? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     I think it was 136 metres, so I think that's 150 yards, 9‑iron.
