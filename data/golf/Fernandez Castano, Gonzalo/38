   GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: It's been a very long round but it was worth the wait. 70 is a very good score to start the tournament. I played very well tee to green. Some putts weren't great but 70 is a great way to begin.  
  
  Q. No bogeys yesterday and then you come out today and bogey your first hole - how tough was that?  
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: It was hard especially after the shot, a beautiful three iron to 15 feet and then three putted. But you have to be patient here and you know you will make bogeys. That was the first one for me and hopefully not of many.  
  
  Q. Third at the Irish Open - has something clicked in your game?  
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: After the Open I took a week off and didn't hit a shot and that helped me disconnect from the game which was driving me crazy. I got to the range at the Irish Open and addressed the ball and everything felt good. Putts dropped and the confidence went up.  
  
  Q. You were working on the putting green with JosÃ© Maria OlazÃ¡bal at the French Open - has that helped?  
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Absolutely. Everything Ollie tells me I put into my game as soon as possible. I putt with my feet close together and that is something he told me to do in Frane and I have been doing that since. You think in America you will have fast greens but they are not that fast and it took me a while to get used to the speed.
