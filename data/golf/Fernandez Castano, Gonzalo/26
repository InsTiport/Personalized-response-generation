 Q.   6‑under on the back nine, how was it playing?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, it was different.   As you said, the back nine had nothing to do with the front nine.   I played very well on front nine, believe it or not.   I didn't hole any putts, but I stayed patient, and all of the putts seemed to drop on the back nine.   
So it was worth the wait, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   We missed you last week in Hong Kong.   Did you decide to leave it up to Miguel Ãngel to take the trophy back to Spain?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   He loves that track.   I don't know if it's in the food or what is it over there but he knows how to play that course, and as I said, he's Lionel Messi of Hong Kong doing hat tricks all around the place.  
   
 Q.   How pleased are you in general with your year?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   It's been a positive year.   Any year that you make it to The Race to Dubai, that means a lot and you've been in the Top 60.   
Of course if you add my victory at The Italian Open, that makes it a good year.   And I also progressed in the World Rankings, so overall, very happy.   It could have been better, of course.   I would have liked to play better in the majors and the World Golf Championships, and of course, making it into The Ryder Cup Team.   
But, hopefully I have more opportunities and why not, 2014, that's my target now.
