 Q.   Could you give us a quick overview of the course and its challenges, and particular difficulties?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I think that this is one of the longest courses we play all year.   And considering it's going to be wet‑‑ well, it's raining now and it's going to be wet Thursday and Friday.   That's not going to make it any shorter, that's for sure.  
So I think it's quite a demanding golf course.   It's pretty challenging.   I mean, it's wide off the tee, even though you've got holes like 9 and like No. 2, No.18 with water.   
So you have to be careful, because as I said, even though it's not very‑‑ fairways are generous, but still you need to putt the ball in play to be able to attack these greens.   And as I said, especially being such a long course, you're going to be hitting long irons and even a few hybrids into these greens.   
   
 Q.   So would you say that with that length, the accuracy; that a premium here?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, accuracy is always a premium.   I would say I think long hitters are going to do well on this course, because as I said, it's playing very long, some of the par 5s.   You need the length to be able to hit in two.   So I think the likes of Colsaerts and‑‑  
   
 Q.   The rough is quite thick in places.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I shouldn't be saying this, this is the first hole I've played this week, but yeah, I mean, maybe it's not thick, but it's going to be punishing enough.   
I think it's this kind of rough that is going to make you think; if you miss a fairway on holes like No.9 where you've got water in your approach shot.   This is just one of those courses that's going to make you think, which is great.  
   
 Q.   That's a good point about the water, that's quite a prominent feature here.   Is that something that's always in your mind when you know there's quite a few holes with water and you've always got to think about it?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, as far as I know, they don't invent a ball that floats.   That's something that you always have to keep in mind, keep the ball‑‑ so, yes, of course, you have to avoid the hazards.   
On this course, as I said, you've got a few holes, No. 8, No.9, No.18 with water and then what you've got, that's probably very important, you've got a lot of bunkers and they are all very well positioned for your tee shots.   
So you have to stay away from all these hazards if you want to be able to score around Lake Malaren.  
   
 Q.   There's some quite deep ones.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   They are deep.   Some of them like there's a very deep number on the middle of the 12th par, the par5, which is kind of a reachable par 5 depending where the wind is blowing.   But if you hit it in a bunker, which is in the middle of that fairway, the hole is kind of over.   I mean, that birdie chance is pretty much gone.  
   
 Q.   And if you had to pick two key holes, what would they be and why?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I like No.9.   I think that 9 is very scenic, especially off the tee.   You've got all that lake in front of you that you have to fly the ball over it, and so that would be one.   
And then I like No. 11 as the‑‑ I don't know, I think it gives you chances, especially when they moved the tee upwards, and it gives you a chance to hit the ball to go for the green in 1 and get an eagle chance.   
So I like those two.   They are probably my favourite holes around here.  
   
 Q.   And obviously coming back to somewhere where you're defending, that always brings a special feeling back, coming back to a course that you've done so well on?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Absolutely.   It's great to be back.   Even though it has not been a great year for me, I haven't played great, but, well, when you come back to a course that you've won, it always brings great memories.   It's a good feeling and hopefully it brings to the best of my game, too.
