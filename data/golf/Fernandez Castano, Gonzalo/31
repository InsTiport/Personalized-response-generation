  GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   It was good, you break par on this course, it's a fantastic result.   I have to say my putting was very good.   It makes me feel happy, because I holed really important putts, some to save par, some holes for birdie.   
So, as I said, 4‑under, it's a great result, and I think it puts me in a very good position for the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   Even though on the last, you looked very annoyed with your second shot, so far away from the pin; that putt was terrific.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, that was a fantastic putt.   I was a little bit annoyed with the second because I hit a perfect shot and I thought I had the perfect club in my hand.   When I saw it just bouncing in the upper tier, I was a bit disappointed.   But anything that's not a splash on 18 is always good.  
   
 Q.   Standing here with the splashing on the umbrella, but essentially it's not been bad, has it.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   No, it's been good.   Temperature has been good.   And, well, as I said to your colleague, at least this time the rain is not coming like the last couple of weeks.   It's not too bad.   
Hopefully it will stop raining because I think the course is playing very fair and the fairways are firm, the greens are firm and that's the way you like to play this course, especially in preparation for The Open Championship in a couple of weeks.   
So hopefully, as I said, it stops, because you don't want to have this course any longer.   It's very long off the tee already and if you have to hit longer shots off the tee, it's going to make it even more difficult.  
   
 Q.   Must be nice to start well this time because you've made a habit of finishing well of late, haven't you.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yes, I've been playing a lot and of course it's always good as you said to start with a good round, especially on this course which I never seem to play very well.   
So it's a tournament that I really like.   I think it's improved a lot through the last years.   I didn't play last year because of my injury, and I've seen very important changes and always for the better.   I think they are doing a great job, and as I said, this is one of the‑‑ this is the oldest Open on the continent of Europe, isn't it.   It's a beautiful trophy and everything is good about it.   So right now, I would like to take this one home.   
   
 Q.   And you've been having these wonderful finishes, moving into place.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Improving, improving every round, which is always good.   Hopefully I keep doing that this week.   Because I think if I improve this form for the following rounds, I think I will have a good chance.
