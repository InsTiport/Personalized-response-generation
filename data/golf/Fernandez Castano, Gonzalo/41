 Q. How pleased are you with your move up the leaderboard today are you?
 GONZALO FERNÃNDEZ-CASTAÃO: Very happy with it because lately I have been moving on a Saturday but the move has been backwards so it was good to see my name on the leaderboard again and I am now in a good position for tomorrow.

 Q. You made more birdies today than the other two days put together, was that simply down to the putter?
 GONZALO FERNÃNDEZ-CASTAÃO: I have been putting nicely over the last couple of days to be honest and today it was okay. I am quite confident since I got rid of the belly putter, I have been putting a little better even though I know I am moving over the ball and my technique is terrible but the ball is going into the hole and that is all that I am interested in.

 Q. Why do you talk to ball in English when it is in the air and not in Spanish?
 GONZALO FERNÃNDEZ-CASTAÃO: That is a very good question. I think it is just that when you are playing with your playing partners and your caddie and they are all talking English all the time that you are thinking in English out there pretty much all the time and I guess that is why you end up talking to the ball in English too. It is a bit of nonsense I suppose but that is why I do it I think!
