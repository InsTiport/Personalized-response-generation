  GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     It was a very good game.   I think we played well.   Unfortunately the back nine, we didn't hole as many putts as we did on the front nine and that was the difference. 
I think that probably that short putt I missed on 17 was very disappointing, but on the other hand, they hit a beautiful putt here on the last.   Overall, half a point, I think is a fair result.

Q.   Probably hurts when you were leading so long in the match. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     It does.   It does.   But that's golf and you know you're going to win some holes and you're going to lose some holes, and just need to get that point back this afternoon. 

Q.   Can you talk through the shot on the bunker on 9, very Seve‑esque? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yes, very Seve‑esque.   That's the kind of shot that maybe in a stroke‑play event, it would have been different, I probably would have played in a different way.   But we had nothing to lose and it just came out right.
