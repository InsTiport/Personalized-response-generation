   GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: This has not been my best week. I hit the ball quite poorly, especially with the irons, but my driving was fantastic and so was my chipping. My putting was so-so. I didn't feel confident at all on top of the putts, but I mean, some went in, some others didn't. So but in general, a very, very satisfying week, finishing third, it's always a great result. 

 Q. In terms of the scores, you seemed incredibly steady when others were having very low ones or struggling. You were just going along nicely?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Yes, I would have liked to have one of those really low ones, but it wasn't the case. 
 As I said, my iron game wasn't as sharp and neither was my putting. So it's difficult to go really low. Even though it's a course where you can go low, but I didn't really -- I didn't really get to that point. 

 Q. You do sound almost surprised to be up in third place?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Well, I was talking with my caddie during the round, it's quite surprising we are contending for this tournament the way I am hitting some of the shots I hit. But that's golf. You know how it's a tough finish and I managed to birdie the last, which is a big bonus.

 Q. Well not many people have managed to do that and it seemed clear that you fancied your chances on that home stretch of getting it even closer. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Believe it or not, I birdied the hole yesterday and I did again today. It's definitely those two 6-irons I hit on the last, probably the two best shots of the week for me. 

 Q. Onto Castellon? 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Absolutely. Looking forward to that, Castellon, Valderrama, play on home soil, I can't wait. 

 Q. Castellon is a special tournament, not only for Sergio's return?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: It's going to be good watching Sergio back and also OlazÃ¡bal playing back again. As I said, I can't wait to get there and hopefully we'll get a Spanish winner this time.

 Q. And a track you play on pretty regularly?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: We do. That's the reason I'm not going to have any practise rounds, just go there Tuesday night and straight to the Pro-Am.
