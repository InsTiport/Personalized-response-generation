Q.   In simple terms, how in the hell did you do that?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I have no idea.   I don't know.   Just one of those days.   I just kept myself quite cool.   I didn't have any expectations going out there.   Just I knew it was a very difficult day, so I think putts were fantastic, and I managed to do a few of those, and believe it or not, I made more birdies on par‑3s, so THAT was very unusual, but it was good. 
I'm very happy with the outcome, and as I said, it was such a difficult day that you had to keep yourself so focused on making every single shot that you couldn't let yourself start thinking about what was going to happen on the following hole.   So you have to be in the moment, and I think that's what I did today.

Q.   Do you have to pinch yourself a little, because level par, one over, two over, very good scores today?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Oh, yeah, definitely.   I mean level par is a great score.   My caddie said, we were joking on the back nine, he said something like I'll take 5‑under today.   I said, "I'll take level par."   Right now it was really blowing when we were out in the range and it blew even harder out there on the course, so very happy with that.

Q.   Take me through the final three holes, if you'd like. 
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah.   I think the key was holing that putt on the 16.   I hit the green with my 3‑wood, and the first putt was very poor.   I left it like three meters short of the hole, and I managed to hole that one. 
You never know, maybe I miss that one and kind of your momentum disappears.   But I holed that one and hit a lovely shot on the next and holed the putt, and then a lovely drive on the last hole, I tried to play the wind, too, and I had a tricky bunker shot.   Didn't do it very well.   And then holed that last putt, which I'm going to sleep very well tonight after that.

Q.   It does sound daft to ask you what makes it so hard out there when you've shot this score.   But is it the cross‑winds or the greens as well?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Today, what felt really windy for me was the sand because we've played in these windy conditions before, but not with the sand.   I mean I'm all covered in sand.   So I have to wash my hands a few times on the course because you could feel that we were covered in dust.   So it was a strange feeling, but I mean I'll take any day if I'm going to shoot 66.

Q.   Just a couple of followups.   I mean as you were talking you had, what, nine birdies?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Nine birdies.

Q.   Even before that, what were some of the key shots that really made it happen?   Like you said, you had a couple ‑‑ what holes did you have those 15 and 25‑footers that you were talking about?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I holed ‑‑ let me think about it.   I holed the first one on the 5th.   That was about seven meters back.   And then I holed another 8, seven meters on the 8, which was nice. 
And 17th hole I holed a long one, too.   But not only that, as I said before, I think I didn't manage to get into trouble today, which is quite easy in these conditions and on this course.   I mean once you hit the rocks or things like that, anything can happen.   But I cooled myself.   I made bogeys.   I knew that I was going to make bogeys today, but I managed to bounce back after each bogey with a birdie, which was very good.

Q.   You kind of answered that.   You look at the scoreboard, you got people like Bjorn, Carlson, that just haven't really figured it out.   They're in danger of missing.   I mean you play with these guys every other weekend you're on the same level.   What was the difference today do you think?
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, the problem about days like this is you can easily make bogeys, and then if you try to be too aggressive on the following holes to make ‑‑ to try and get those shots back, you can get yourself in trouble or maybe short side yourself when you get to the green or anything, maybe being too aggressive on a long putt, trying to hole the birdie.   It's days like this it's easy to make bogeys, as I said, and it's easy to go for a birdie after that.

Q.   It happens very quick. 
GONZALO FDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah.   I don't know how I managed to have it the other way around.   But who knows.   Tomorrow will be another day, and it's just one round of golf.   Now we need to put three more solid rounds together, and hopefully we will have our chance on Sunday.
