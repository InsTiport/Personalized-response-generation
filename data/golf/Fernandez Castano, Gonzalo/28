Q.   67 yesterday, 11 more shots today, describe how difficult that golf course is?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, it's playing tough in this wind, especially.   On the 10th, we start the first four holes playing into the wind which is never a good thing.   But if you start at the first, at least you get the first four holes a little bit downwind.   So that didn't help me much. 
Plus six, it's not the way I wanted to play today, especially finishing with plus four on the last four holes. 

Q.   What's the most difficult aspect of the game in these conditions?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, it's everything.   You know, it's playing really, really long and you want to have a chance to get on in two on the par 5s.   These greens, even though they are quite big, they all have a lot of run‑outs, and of course reading the putts in this wind, it's never an easy task. 

Q.   Most difficult hole today, and why? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I would say 13 and the 9th, both are playing into the wind a little bit from the left‑to‑right, so they are both playing very long, even though they move the tees slightly forward, but still it's a driver and at least 4‑iron, 3‑iron. 

Q.   At the end of the day, that score might not be too bad. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I know.   During the round, I was trying to set up little goals just to keep me motivated, and of course, after that double‑bogey and the bogey at 7, at 6 and 7, I was thinking, okay, if I can just keep it around level par, overall, not a bad score.   And I 3‑putted the last, so I'm not very happy.
