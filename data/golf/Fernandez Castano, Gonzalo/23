Q.   What do you think about Tiger's game? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   He's definitely more comfortable.   I remember at the Match Play, his routine was longer.   You could see he wasn't confident with what he was doing.   He just got up to the ball and hit it.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   That was nice.

Q.   Knowing that Tiger leads you by 3 now, how does that change your mindset? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   I have to continue to play my best if I want to have a chance tomorrow.   This is a demanding course, very challenging.   There is not a weak hole.   Every approach to the green has to be consistent here on the PGA TOUR, so I'm excited right now.

Q.   (Indiscernible)? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   It was a really good shot, and it's a signature hole of this course, so it was a very special moment.

Q.   Are you looking forward to tomorrow's forecast?   The winds are supposed to be 30 miles‑per‑hour.   Do you feel like that gives you a little more of a chance? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   I'm not a bad player in windy conditions.   This is something that is a really, really demanding golf course.   I don't know.   I think I'm going to need my best out there tomorrow.
