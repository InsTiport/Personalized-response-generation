  GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   It's been a good day after all.   I had a little short‑circuit at 13 where I 4‑putted, but I think I haven't played actually that bad.   I played again‑‑ especially on the back nine, I gave myself a lot of birdie chances and I was happy to finish with two birdies on the last three.   I think that was a little turnaround for the day.   
   
 Q.   And at the last, it was almost even better?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, believe it or not, as soon as I hit it, I said to my guy, well, it's going to be good.   Well, I never thought it was going to be that close.  
Yeah, it's been almost a 3 but very happy with the birdie.  
   
 Q.   We hate to concentrate on any negative, but you mentioned the 4‑putt, is that the sort of thing that you can dismiss quickly?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   It's hard.   It's not easy after especially such a bad two putts that I hit.   But those things happen and you have to get on with it and keep looking forward.   I think we are still in the tournament and if we have a strong weekend, we can be there top of the leaderboard on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   You're in a terrific position and there's one player running away at the moment, but otherwise, everything is grouped?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, you never know.   This is one of those courses that if you play good, you can go low.   The forecast for the weekend is also pretty good.   Hopefully we can go low Saturday and Sunday.
