 Q. What are your thoughts on this golf course and how it's set up for this weekend?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Well, I think it's a beauty. The way the PGA sets it up, the PGA, they know what they're doing every time they setup a course for a major, so it's a great experience to play in this tournament. And unfortunately we got a bit of rain and this softened the course a little bit and it played slightly easier, but it's a good course and I'm very happy to be here. 

 Q. Speaking of the fog delay this morning, did that affect your preparation at all coming into the first round?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Yeah, I got lucky that I wasn't in the afternoon field, so as soon as I woke up I saw there was a delay so I stayed a little longer in bed. But I felt sorry for the guys that were playing in the morning because waking up at 4, 4:30, you have to wake up early and then not being able to play until 10, that's not something that you want. 

 Q. Now you're 2-under on the back nine, coming up, do you feel that you can wake up tomorrow and continue to build on that?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean I played steady golf today, I'm very happy with my tee to green performance, I left myself a lot of birdie opportunity, unfortunately I wasn't that confident with my putter. I was like almost not getting it to the hole with my putter and that's probably what you expect coming from Europe, you expect to get really fast greens and maybe they weren't that quick today. 
 But as I said, 2-under is pretty good play and that's great.

 Q. What do you need to do tomorrow to stay on top of the leaderboard?
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTANO: Just to play the way I did today. Just to keep it going.
