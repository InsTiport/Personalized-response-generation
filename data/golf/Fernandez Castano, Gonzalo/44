 Q. Gonzalo, just tell us a little bit about today. Your team were three-nil down so it was very important that you two won one of your games. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: Absolutely. We saw the leaderboard and we saw a lot of red, which is not good. We know we have to play well. We are 2-under, 2-down for a while, but we made a very good come back and it was fun. I mean, we knew we had to put those points on the leaderboard, but still, there's a long way to go to Sunday. And anything can happen. 

 Q. And Miguel, you have now played more matches in this Seve Trophy, Vivendi Trophy than anyone else, you obviously enjoy the matches. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I enjoy very much. I enjoy it and I've played all six. I'm very proud to be here, in the sixth Seve Trophy, and I keep fighting with these new young guns. I love it, I love the match play especially enjoy here with Gonzalo, like he says, coming from behind and turning over the match. 

 Q. It's probably about time Continental Europe did something and got the trophy back again. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: We think. So we won the first time and that's it. I hope that this week, like Gonzalo says, until Sunday, there's a lot of golf to happen yet and we hope this year we take the trophy back. 

 Q. A lot of people said that Great Britain and Ireland were favors but it's evenly-balanced don't you think? 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: It is balanced. There are no favourites. It's true that some of the best players in the GB&I Team are not here, but still, I mean, they are strong and they all can play golf. We know them very well. We play with them week-in and week-out and they have made a lot of birdies but so can we. 
 I think it's going to be a very, very interesting match. I think it's going to be tight, and people are going to enjoy two it, which is the main goal here. 

 Q. You are one of the rare players here to have a fan club, you have many fans in France. How do you appreciate that? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, I appreciate that very much. I've been here playing in France for so many years now, I'm 21 years on the Tour and I was here at the LancÃ³me and I feel very happy to be here. 

 Q. Many players have success, you remember. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: There was Seve, myself, JosÃ© Maria, yeah. 

 Q. I heard it will become a Spanish territory next year. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes, why not? That should be nice. 

 Q. You remember this hole (18) very well. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes, I holed an approach, a chip from the side of the bunker. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: But our target is not to get to the 18th during the week.
