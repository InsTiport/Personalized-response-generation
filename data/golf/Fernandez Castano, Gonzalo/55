  GONZALO FERNANDEZ CASTANO:  It was an interesting night! Well, the worst part is that at 1.30 in the morning I had to change rooms. I heard a baby crying so you should have seen me at a quarter to two walking along the corridor in my pajamas looking for a room. The receptionist offered me a room at the front but I said no, the furthest part away! When the phone rang at 6.00 am the receptionist told me it was Mr. Ballesteros on the phone and he told me the story about Thomas and I had played of time to warm up and playing with Robert was a great honour. The receptionist told me the family with the baby are leaving today so I will be back in my own room tonight. But I will check first! 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  We are together again this afternoon? Good, I wanted to play with him again. I haven't seen Thomas but I hear he's pretty weak. It's always the case with that sort of problem. I think 10 of his drives I could just walk up and play it! I think we took mine on the 9th and 11th and 12th. Eight out of 13 we took Gonzo's. No need for me to drive. Gonzo also chipped in for the eagle.
