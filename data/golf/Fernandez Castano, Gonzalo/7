 Q.   You turn around on the 18, you look at the leaderboard, you see Adam is still going 10‑under, it makes you look‑‑  
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   Anything under 60 is still a good score.  
   
 Q.   Did you have any preconceived notion about what it was going to play like today?  
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   Not really.   I think‑‑ I mean I played Tuesday morning and it was really windy.   The conditions were very mild today.  
But it's one of those courses that you have to play good every club in the bag if you want to go low.   Anything in the 60s, I'll take it, it's always a fantastic round.  
   
 Q.   Here in America Arnold Palmer is an icon of the highest dimension.   What does he mean to you?  
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   When I grew up my idol was Seve Ballesteros.   But when I got into the game and got to know the history of the game, of course the big three, Jack, Arnold and Gary, those were the ones.   And if I had to choose who to play with, I would probably choose those three.  
   
 Q.   It's awfully nice to shake his hand and play in this golf tournament, isn't it?   
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   Very stimulating to shake his hand.   Once you get to know him, he's just incredible.   Somebody you have to admire in every aspect, not only on the golf course.   
   
 Q.   What was going well today?  
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   What was going well?   Everything.   I played solid tee‑to‑green, and my putting was good.   I missed like a 10‑inch putt on No. 4 and I said it's going to be one of those days.  
I have to say I putted beautifully.   It's one of these courses that you need to play great to score.   You need to hole the putts.   The greens are very, very slippery, and a lot of very undulated.   It's never easy to go under par at Bay Hill.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your plans leading up to the Masters?  
GONZALO FERNANDO‑CASTANO:   Well, next week I'll be heading to Malaysia for the first edition of the EurAsia Cup.   I'm excited about it.   I think it can be the beginning of a great event.   And it's great to be part of it.   Maybe it's not the ideal preparation for the Masters, but I think it was a way to support the European Tour and also support, as I said, this big competition that hopefully in the near future will be as big as the Ryder or The Presidents Cup.
