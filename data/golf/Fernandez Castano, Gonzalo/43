 Q. Gonzo, it all came down to the last and it was down to you. What did you hit at the last? That was a great shot under the circumstances. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: Oh, I hit a beautiful 5-iron. I knew I needed to hit it on the green. That would give a lot of confidence to Robert playing next. And of course, I hit just exactly the shot I was -- I tried to. I mean, it was absolutely perfect, and well, I think Robert, he relaxed too much, but man that first putt was slippery. I've never been so nervous in my life. People don't understand, playing on a team and playing on your own, all of the people is just behind, just try and hole it for you; that's probably the most nervous I've ever been, but it was fantastic. I loved it. 

 Q. And also knowing the situation, if you had lost that hole, you were going to go down. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: Absolutely. Robert and I knew at that point it was crucial. Robert played very well today. It's amazing after being so long away from the competition and away from golf. I mean, he just started practising two weeks ago. The great shots he hit; he was really unlucky, he had seven lipouts today. His putting was very good but just the ball didn't want to go in. 

 Q. So how do you see it now? Tomorrow, eight points to play for. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: Anything can happen. We still have 18 matches to play. It's only a two-point deficit, so anything can happen. 

 Q. Get some momentum. 
 GONZALO FERNANDEZ-CASTAÃO: We need to put some blue on the leaderboard, that's for sure. It's hard to play when you see all that red because you know you need to fight back just to get your points so you don't lose too much ground. But I think if we manage especially the morning to put those blue numbers on the board, it would be very good.
