Q.   What do you think of being in such a wonderful position in that championship?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Very proud of the way I played today.   I hit the ball lovely.   I missed only one green, and it was the one I hit in the water on 17 but I made a great recovery.   Overall, I put myself into good position. 

Q.   Elaborate on the recovery, because a birdie on the last is a rarity?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     It is, actually.   I hit a beautiful drive and I knew where the pin was and that kind of follows, so if you could achieve to putt the ball in there, you will leave yourself a makeable birdie putt, and that's exactly what I did. 

Q.   Something special for you, playing the BMW tournament in Shanghai? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     Well, it brings fantastic memories out of 2006 when I won the BMW Asian Masters.   Hopefully, why not, we can do it again tomorrow. 

Q.   It's been a tough old week with the weather.   I take it wasn't an awful lot easier today despite the 67. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     You don't get to see these blue skies in China very often, but it's absolutely wonderful, in spite of the heavy winds we had the first couple of rounds, it's been really good weather and you can see how it stays tomorrow. 
I have seen the predictions and it's meant to be the same, so that's very good news, not only for us but also for the big crowds.   We have really good crowds this week and that makes this tournament extra special.   I think it's a fantastic event put on by BMW.   You can see that golf is definitely growing in this country.
