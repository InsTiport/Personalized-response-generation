 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I think I'm happy in a way.   I pretty much had the round under control every day.   It's not that I had things get away from me.   So I have to be happy, this is the first time I've made the cut.   
Unfortunately, a little disappointed with that 3‑putt finish on the last.   That would have put me in the top‑10 and I would secure my place for next year and some of the good things that were at stake.   
But overall, I think I have to be happy.   It is my best finish in a Major Championship, and especially on a really tough one like a U.S. Open.   
   
 Q.   The consistency you had throughout the week, talk about that.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I think I was mentally prepared to what was going to happen.   When you play a U.S. Open, you know you're going to make bogeys, you just have to get away with it and just keep plowing away and that's exactly what I did.   
It's been a good week.   Overall I think it's been a very good week.   There's many positives to take out from this U.S. Open and hopefully will make me a little stronger for future Majors and future U.S. Opens.  
   
 Q.   You say that, Top‑20 in the Masters as well, and it's a continuation of that progress.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yes, I think it's a good progression.   I just need to keep working on the same things I'm doing and hopefully one Sunday I can find myself contending for one of these, because this is what it's all about, playing in these Major Championships and just feeling that pressure on the Sunday, which I think is good.
