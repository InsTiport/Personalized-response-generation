Q.   What wasn't feeling right on the range? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I was hooking it, which is never a good feeling before starting a round.   I was hooking all the balls left and the wind was blowing right‑to‑left on the range and that didn't help, either, because the balls were going way left. 
But I started with a birdie and I think that calmed me down a little bit and I think I made a very important putt for par on 15, after bogeying 14.   I think that was probably the key point of the round, because if I had bogeyed that short par 4, it would have been painful, especially bogeying the previous hole is not too bad because it was really difficult today, 2‑iron, crosswind, but two in a row that would have been painful. 
But I holed that one and then managed to birdie both 16 and 17, which was fantastic. 

Q.   Some players were saying the back nine was more difficult. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, I think the whole course is difficult.   You're playing with crosswind most of the time, and it's not easy, so you have to be‑‑ it doesn't really matter front nine or back nine. 
Of course on the back nine you ever those brutal par 3s, 14 and 17 but as I said, I played quite solid all day long and I had a good time with my playing partners, with Frank and George, and I think everything went pretty well, even though, of course, it's difficult to be relaxed in a major championship but I think as I said the first calmed me down a little bit. 

Q.   What's been the difference‑‑
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I was complaining last week after Akron, because it seems like the best I can do in America is tie for 54th.   But I know I can do better.   I just need to believe in myself and hopefully this is the week. 

Q.   You mentioned low scores were not there the last few weeks, is there something that's been clicking in your game where you thought the scores would come around, too?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   No, it's probably Ryder Cup pressure.   I'm just there on the borderline and I need to play well, and probably I've been putting too much pressure on myself.   But I guess it's normal.   I've never been in The Ryder Cup.   That would be a dream come true, and especially with OlazÃ¡bal, who is a good friend of mine and on The Ryder Cup, he is captaining the team this year and that would be pretty special. 
Maybe that was it, just putting too much pressure and I just need to go out there and be more relaxed not thinking about so much the result and just go out there and hit the ball, that's what it's all about.
