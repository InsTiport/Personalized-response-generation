 Q.   Just off the 18th green.   Obviously not the result you were looking for.   Give us your reflections on that match.  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   Well, I think if there was one day to beat Tiger Woods, this was it.   I didn't take the opportunity.   I missed a few shots.   And of course you can't miss spots if you want to beat one of the greatest in history.  
   
 Q.   Is it different playing Tiger Woods?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   I wouldn't say it was different.   I would say I was very nervous on the first.   But that's all I can say.   But after the first I can relax.   And from then onwards it was like playing, I'm not going to say any other guy in the field, but my nerves just calm down a little bit and everything got better.   
   
 Q.   You said that you learned from this experience.   And people do say they learn from playing with Tiger.   If you played with him in a Major, you know what it's like.   What did you learn today?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   Well, I have to think about this a bit later and be able to answer maybe tomorrow.   But I mean it was a very nice experience.   I truly enjoyed it.   He's a true gentleman and it was a good match.   I'm disappointed with the 18th.   But it was a good match.   I enjoyed it.   
   
 Q.   Reflections of the today, please?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   It was a good day.   I had good chances.   I mean if there was one day to beat Tiger Woods, this was it.   That was the first time I played with him.   But I'm sure he played far away from his best.   Well, I didn't take the opportunity.   I was sorely disappointed.   
On the other hand, I think I gave him a headache on the 18th, which is good.   It's a shame the putt didn't go in, because I hit it where I wanted to and how I wanted.   I'll probably be able to answer this tomorrow better, I mean to think about what happened to me on the course.   And I can give you my reflections tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You said you were nervous on the first tee?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   I was very nervous.  
   
 Q.   But you started off very well.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   I know.   Sometimes I'm capable of doing that.   I like being nervous on the course.   Not that nervous, though.   But I managed to hit that 3‑wood on the fairway on the first.   And I think that nerves calmed down a little bit.   And of course birdieing was a bonus.   But especially since I still think I had my opportunities out there and I didn't take them.   
   
 Q.   Well, you learn from these experiences, don't you?   What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.   You will learn, and you'll be stronger coming back.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   Thank you very much.   
   
 Q.   Is this a match you feel you lost or do you feel you were beaten by Tiger Woods?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   It's hard to say.   It's hard to say.   I think I had my opportunities out there today.   I mean if there was one day to beat Tiger Woods, this was it.   I had my chances and I didn't take them.   And you can't do that with one of the greatest in history.   
   
 Q.   Where do you feel a turning point may have been, where you really had a chance to take control?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   It's hard to say, but maybe that birdie putt on the par‑5.  
   
 Q.   13?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   13.   To go 2‑up.   But this guy is too good.   If he goes too long he gets more motivated and wins the next four.   It's hard to say.   I think I hit some good putts on the back nine.   But I couldn't get good ones, they didn't drop.   Probably the one on the 18th or the 15th were good putts, but Tiger didn't hole a single one, just the one on the 18th.
