Q.   We're seeing that the scores aren't that low today.   Is it difficult out there? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   Well, I found it difficult, especially the back nine.   I think I played all right, but the scoring, the back nine is where you should score on this course, and unfortunately I didn't do that.   It's a shame because I felt‑‑ I feel I played all right tee to green, but unfortunately my putting wasn't quite there again. 
I'm a little bit far behind for Sunday, but we're still looking forward to playing on Sunday at Augusta, hopefully going low, and looking for a good finish. 

Q.   Do you like your position or‑‑
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   Well, I'd rather be a few more under par, but yeah, I can't complain.   There's guys who have missed the cut and they won't be playing this weekend.   I'm not going to complain at all.

Q.   Did the course play harder today? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTANO:   It always plays hard.   It's not an easy course at all.   It's one of those courses, as I've said before, you just have to learn when you can be aggressive, where you have to play percentages, and you know, it's going to get you.   At some stage you're going to make bogeys, you just have to be patient and try to really go low on par‑5s, and that's exactly what I didn't do today.
