 Q.   Two weeks ago you won in Turin, tell us about how you spent the last two weeks.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I mean, it was fun.   Every time you win a tournament, the following weeks are always very relaxed and quite fun.   It was the first one, you always had to do a bit of press and media, which is fine.   Anything that comes with a victory, you accept it, and then The Ryder Cup week was very, very exciting.   I mean, I was so nervous for Ollie, especially the way things were going the first couple of days and then all of a sudden the way they turned it around on Sunday, one of the most exciting golf days I've ever witnessed.   Just one of the most, as I said, exciting golf rounds I've ever seen.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your game here at St. Andrews; Carnoustie you played yesterday, and today at Kingsbarns.   How do you feel?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, anything under par at Carnoustie is all a good round, and I'm glad we got that one out of the way first, because definitely it's the toughest out of the three.   
Kingsbarns, it's a course that you can score if you play well.   My game wasn't really there today.   I didn't knock them close enough to the holes, but luckily my 69, I managed to make three birdies coming back.   
So that was pretty good.   I mean, good feelings for the next couple of days, and now two rounds in a row in St. Andrews which is always a good thing to get a feeling of the course, and hopefully the weather remains like this.   It's a fantastic tournament.   You don't get venues like this and when the weather is nice, it's just an amazing place to be.   
   
 Q.   How difficult is it the first two rounds when other players are playing other courses, to see the low scores we are seeing on St. Andrews and to focus on your own game?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   You don't have to pay much attention to the leaderboards, because as I said, we'll start to find out after everybody has played the three courses, and when we all tee up on Sunday‑‑ Branden Grace has made an amazing 17‑over after two rounds is an amazing score.   He's going to be the one to catch, especially he's won three times this year, it's not going to be easy to get him but we'll try.
