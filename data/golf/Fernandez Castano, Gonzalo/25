 Q.   How pleased are you the way you've played over the past two days?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Very happy because this is a course that I normally do well but seems like everything is flowing these last couple of days.   Both days I started with a bogey at the first, so apparently that's what I have to do tomorrow to make the birdies come.   
   
 Q.   You did shoot a 65 last year, so things are getting better?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, yeah, good point, that's probably my best score here in Abu Dhabi, and that helped me into the Top‑20 last year, so hopefully I can improve my result from 2012.   
   
 Q.   Is it a learning experience, getting used to playing here?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, of course, the more you play a course, the more you learn about it.   But no, I guess just having played the week before at the Volvo Golf Champions, I think that helps a lot.   It's not the same playing a tough course like this the first week of the year; you warm‑up last week pretty much and now you are ready to go.  
   
 Q.   Did you winter well?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   Did you winter well?   Did you have a good break?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yes, it was short.   It was short.   It was short.   It's always short but it's good to be back.   We can't complain.   We are guys doing what we like traveling all around the world.   Of course sometimes you need a bit of rest but I'm really happy to be started 2013.   
I didn't have time to change anything; there wasn't time enough, but I would like to take a few weeks off after Qatar just to work a bit in the gym and that's it.   But no, I think the swing is all right.   Of course, it can be improved, but I'm not going to complain too much.
