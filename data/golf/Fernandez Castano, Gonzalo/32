  GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I'm very pleased.   Especially after last week, where I hit the ball really bad, and I did some work last weekend at Wentworth.   And it paid off.   I hit the ball more consistently, and my putting worked quite nicely.   It's a great score.  
   
 Q.   So you were annoyed after Wentworth and thought, got to knuckle down and do something?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, it has not been a great season for me so far.   Even though Wentworth was the first cut I missed all year, it's always disappointing missing the weekend in our Flagship Event, you know.   
So I think going out today with Ollie and Paul Lawrie, which are good friends, is always a good help.   As I said I hit the ball better and holed some crucial putts, some to save par and some for birdie.   I'm very pleased with the score.   
   
 Q.   How was it playing alongside JosÃ© Maria, because he's helped you so much in the past, as well, hasn't he.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Oh, it's great.   We are good friends.   It's somebody who I admire a lot, not only as a player but as a person.   But it's always good.   We get to spend a lot of time together on Tour, not only on the golf course but off the golf course, too.   It's always great, and same with Paul.   I mean, Paul I get along great with him, and so the three of us, I think even though they didn't play very well, we had a good time playing together.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like he's relaxed and supportive.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, pretty much.   Believe it or not, that's the way it felt out there today.   Ollie was struggling at times and so was Paul, but as I said, I truly enjoyed playing with them.   
We also, as you know, Alex OlazÃ¡bal is caddying for Ollie who is one of my best friends, and David, who is caddying for Paul, caddied for me for a few tournaments a couple of years ago.   
So we are all good friends.   It was a very entertaining match.  
   
 Q.   I presume that Ryder Cup didn't come up in conversation.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   We were joking, because we said we didn't know what was wrong with Paul because he's been playing great for the last two years and the only two tournaments he played alongside JosÃ© Maria, he couldn't score.   So we have already agreed that of course he's going to be at The Ryder Cup and so OlazÃ¡bal is not going to follow him.   We are going to send one of the vice captains to see how he's doing.  
   
 Q.   JosÃ© Maria said yesterday that you have to get your skates on just that little bit.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I do.   As I said after my victory in Singapore last year, I haven't been playing at my best.   Well, the tournaments in the Middle East weren't too bad, but I have to say the turning point was probably that match against Tiger in Tucson, Arizona.   
Unfortunately things haven't been going too well, but still have time to turn things around and hopefully this is the week.  
   
 Q.   So you let that match affect you a bit more, did you?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Not really, but I had a great opportunity of beating Tiger, which would have been great.   But it's more, I don't know, I hit some awkward shots there and I think my confident went down a little bit and then Doral, a couple of weeks later, I didn't play great.   
Since then, I have kind of lost my swing.   But hopefully as I said this will be the turning point of the season.
