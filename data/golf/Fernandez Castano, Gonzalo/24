  GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I think my short game got me out of here today, because my iron game wasn't half as sharp as it's been the last couple of days.   I've been pretty solid off the tee, despite that tee shot on 16 where I feel I lost my concentration‑‑ a very costly bogey but happy with the birdie at the last, and that's always a nice way to finish the round. 

Q.   You sound frustrated but there must be some satisfaction in there, as well. 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well.   I could see Justin played really solid and I could see he was kind of escaping, but I kept trying, even though it didn't work.   And at the end, I hung in there, which as I said, minus one, the way I hit the ball today was not too bad.

Q.   Part and parcel of playing with the man who is leading the tournament, you notice what he's doing?
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Yeah, especially the way he played today, I think he played really steady, even though he bogeyed‑‑ 3‑putts from probably 15 feet.   But apart from, that he's played flawless golf.   I like the way he's hit the ball.   Just so steady.   His game looks so easy. 

Q.   Are you going to make that game look easy tomorrow?   Do you still like your chances? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Well, I do.   I do.   I think I am four or five shots away, but I think if I play solid, if I go low tomorrow, you never know, it's a really tough course, so it depends, if the wind picks up a little bit, anything can happen. 
But yeah, I'm going definitely going to give it a go.
