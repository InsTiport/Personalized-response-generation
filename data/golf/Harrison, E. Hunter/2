Q.
Talk about that a little bit.
E. HUNTER HARRISON:  The donation we just made?
Q.  Yes.
E. HUNTER HARRISON:  It was a great effort.  We at CN started with a 100,000 base donation and we agreed that through our CN miracle match, we would match dollar for dollar with the hospital raised in the London area.  And along with a little rounding this morning, that totaled to $250,000, which is an opportunity for us to give back to the community and to have two winners at this event, not just the young lady that wins this afternoon, but the hospital and the children that does such wonderful work.
Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the tournament so far and whether you're happy.
E. HUNTER HARRISON:  We couldn't be more thrilled.  This is our first year as the title sponsor.  The weather has been beautiful.  The people of London have been beautiful.  The people at London Hunt have been beautiful.  The RCGA, the players.  We couldn't be more delighted.  We are committed to making this one of the premiere events.  We're not just a fill in sponsor.  We're committed to making this one of the premiere events on the LPGA Tour and we couldn't be more satisfied with how things have come off.
Q.  As high as your expectations might have been for this tournament, how impressed are you with the size of the crowds?
E. HUNTER HARRISON:  As I understand it, all records are being broken.  I go all over the U.S. and Canada...  (end of audio.)
