  Q. What is it about this place that makes you feel so comfortable?
 BEN AN:   I'm not sure.  I played well the first year when I came here, and then so far it's been a good golf course to me.  It's a great golf course, I think.  Weather is nice, nice and warm.  You just hit it far out there.  Greens roll nicely.  That's why I think I've scored pretty good here.
 Q. Why do you like the course so much?
 BEN AN:   The conditions I think are always pure.  This grass is just in perfect condition, firm greens and pretty fast greens.  Just suits my eye, I guess.
 Q. Usually obviously the 16th hole is filled with fans.  It's quite an iconic part of the TOUR.  What's it going to be like this year do you think?
 BEN AN:   Well, I just saw it's still there.  There's a big stadium there, but it's not going to be as much as the last couple years.  But still good to see some fans out there.  I know there won't be any in the first 15 holes, but it's good to see the fans back a little bit and hopefully can feel a little bit more of a fan atmosphere out there.
 Q. How has it been the last few weeks or months playing without fans?
 BEN AN:   It's been boring I'd say.  I don't get the hype -- I'm sure most of you guys feel the same way.  Hit good shots, we don't feel the energies and the cheer coming from the people.  Especially when you're playing well, in contention, and you just don't feel any energy coming out.  There's not really any hype or momentum.  It's definitely good to see some fans coming back out this week.  It's been about a year now since we've had fans, so I quite miss them now.  Yeah, it's been a year.
 Q. How is the game?  How is the swing going?
 BEN AN:   Yeah, it's been better.  I think it's been better the last couple events towards the end of last year.  I struggled a little bit.  I didn't hit it as good as I used to.  But so far this year it's been decent.  Struggled a little bit on the greens last week, but this is a course I really like and the greens are pure, so hopefully I can keep my tee to green and then we'll see what happens.
 Q. Have you made many changes to the swing and how is that progressing?
 BEN AN:   Yeah, got a new coach last November-ish.  I'm working with Sean Foley now, and it's been awesome.  I've been hitting a lot better, worked on my swing a lot more, and everything seems to make sense, so we're heading to the right direction, and hopefully some good results.
 Q. Have you got any particular goals for this year coming into 2021?
 BEN AN:   Win the PGA TOUR.  That's always been the goal.  That's always my dream, to play in the tour championship is definitely one of my goals for the year.
 Q. What is the biggest achievement of your career to date would you say?
 BEN AN:   That's a good question.  My biggest achievement would be playing the PGA TOUR because I haven't won it yet, but there are a few achievements I've done.  I won the U.S. Amateur.  I won the BMW Championship.  But my ultimate goal is definitely -- haven't achieved it yet, but I'd definitely say it's playing the PGA TOUR for this is my sixth year now, so it's pretty decent to survive out here.  It's not easy to play for this long.  It's quite an achievement, I think.
 Q. Outside of golf, what do you get up to?  How do you spend your time away from the game?
 BEN AN:   Well, I have a family now.  I've got a wife and a kid.  So when I'm home I'll play golf a little bit, and when I come back home, just take care of the baby, try to play with him a little more.  But if I have free time I'll just play games on my phone, and that's about it.  I don't really like going out too much.  I just prefer to stay home and rest a little bit and watch YouTube and Netflix.
 Q. What kind of games do you play on your phone?
 BEN AN:   It's like Korean games that I just play on my mobile phone.  I used to play a lot of games, PX4 and Xboxes, but I've got a kid now so it's hard to play those games.  But yeah, I've been watching a lot of like Netflix and shows here and there.  It's been all right, though.  I've been traveling by myself, but it does kill the time easily.
