  Q. Some comments on your opening round, please.
 BEN AN:   Yeah, I hit it good, putted good, made some birdies.  Yeah, I shot 4-under.  But yeah, overall I was happy that I didn't hit any balls in the water.  I think that's a big thing here, there's some water out there that's in play, but I didn't lose any balls and I made some good birdie putts.  So I was able to keep the momentum going on the back nine.
 I made three birdies or two birdies in a row, yeah, so that was a nice momentum going in.  Had some good save on the last.  Overall it was decent day, yeah.
 Q. What was working for you well in your game?
 BEN AN:   Off the tee.  I struggled a little bit off the tee last couple months, but it's been a lot tighter, so I think I'm giving myself more birdie chances and then my wedge has been pretty good.  So just everything was working, it's not like one particular thing.
 Obviously some of the putts dropped today, that always helps.  And then hopefully I can keep hitting it close and then if I hit it close I don't have to worry about the putting performance, so just need to hit it closer.
 Q. Then to compare to this morning's conditions, how were they out there this afternoon?
 BEN AN:   It was, I don't know, I'm not sure what it was like in the morning, but when I played it was nice and warm, at least I didn't have a sweater on.  But this morning it looked pretty chilly out there.  But, yeah, greens are rolling nicely, they're firming up a little bit, yeah, it was a little breezy, a little swirly wind, so it wasn't the easiest out there, I think.
