 Q.  So great match today.  I know it didn't turn out in your favor, but it was close the whole way.  Can you just talk me through it.  
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: Yeah, I mean, it was a very close match.  He was always up, then tied it, and then -- I mean, made a great shot on 18 and then three-putted; that's rough.   
Yeah.   
 Q.  And this is your first USGA Championship.  
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Can you tell me your thoughts of the experience?  
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: I think it's a great experience.  I mean, playing match play, I really like match play, playing one against one.   
I think it's probably the best tournament in junior golf maybe.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  What did you think of the course?  
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: I mean, the course is a major course so it's in great shape.  It's a terrific golf course.  I like the upper course better for match play.  You can give yourself a lot of chances.   
It's quite fun.   
 Q.  What's next for you this summer?  
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: I'm playing the Junior America's Cup with the Mexican National Team and that's it.  After that, I'm going with my family.
