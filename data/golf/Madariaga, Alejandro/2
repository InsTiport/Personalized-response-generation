Q. Into the quarterfinals.  Can you talk about that?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: I feel very excited about it, yeah.
Q. Yeah.  You had a nice stretch in there, 7 to 12.  You won five of the six holes.  Can you tell me about that stretch of golf?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: Yeah, I mean, I was hitting -- at first I was kind of nervous and not hitting the ball so good.
After that on 7 I hit a great 3-iron to like 15 feet and drained the putt.  So since then I start playing decent, make some birdies, and give me some opportunities with birdie as well.
Q. And then obviously this is a long day; two different matches.  When you get to the end, is a lot of it more mental game?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: Yeah, I think it gets pretty mental.  You got to know your tendencies when you are tired.  My tendencies when I'm tired I miss all the time to the right.
So I start playing a shot, kind of a fade.  It helped me through the round.
Q. Can tell me about the birdies on 9 and 14?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: On 9 I hit a driver to like 53 yards, I think.  Then made a good shot and leave it to like eight feet and made the putt.
On 14 I didn't make birdie, but I went for it on 1, leave it on the greenside bunker and leave it to like five feet, and then I had two putts to win the match.
So I didn't make the greatest putt, but I leave it to like six inches, so win the match.
Q. Do you have a lot of match play experience you can draw on coming into this week?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: Not really.  In Mexico we play once a year match play event and I have played only one time in the U.S. match play event.  That's it.
Q. Going into tomorrow, the quarterfinals, what's your mindset?
ALEJANDRO MADARIAGA: I mean, just hole by hole, shot by shot.  I mean, don't get frustrated if you made bad shots.  Just going to be one hole.  Try to give myself some opportunities.
