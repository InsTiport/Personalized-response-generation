Q. Clement, first of all, congratulations on a great round.  What was different today, 76 yesterday to 68 today?
CLEMENT SORDET: Well, yesterday I was a bit nervous, to be honest.  It was my first U.S. Open, and after the first tee it was -- well, I play -- I played all right, but I missed a few shots that cost me a lot.  Like on 18 I hit driver out of bounds, made double.
But I didn't play much different from yesterday.  Played really well.  Especially, on the back nine.  I really focused on keeping the ball on the fairway, on the green and try to have a chance for birdie, and I did.
Q. Is this your first time at Pebble Beach?
CLEMENT SORDET: No, I played about 15 rounds here, because I played in college for four years.  And we used to play a tournament here every year.  I won my first one --
Q. Congratulations.
CLEMENT SORDET: Thank you.
Q. How is this set up different from when you've seen it in the past?  How much tougher is it?
CLEMENT SORDET: It's much longer.  Pretty narrow.  And the rough is just ridiculous.  Well, it's a U.S. Open, so you can't expect much different.  But, yeah, it's pretty much different.
Q. How excited are you, make the cut, first time in a major, and to have it here, someplace that you won before?
CLEMENT SORDET: Well, I don't know yet if I made the cut, but it looks...
Q. It looks pretty good.
CLEMENT SORDET: It looks pretty good.  But we'll see.  We'll see tonight.  But I'm really, really happy how I handled myself today.
Q. What will you need to go work on tonight --
CLEMENT SORDET: Nothing.
Q. -- or will you go work on anything?
CLEMENT SORDET: Nothing.  I think I'll just go home because I'm pretty tired.  Just been the nerves on the back nine.  And, yeah.  Hopefully I'm not going to change -- hopefully I'll play tomorrow and won't change anything.
