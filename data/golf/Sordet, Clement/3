CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, I woke up at four in the morning because I had an early tee time, and I knew straight away at four in the morning I got a text, and like some people were asking if we were safe, but we were here.
Q. What did you think?
CLEMENT SORDET: Well, I tried not to think about it, but that's why I had this on my hat.  But I was just trying to enjoy my last day at The Open, and that's it, yeah.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, well, I live in Nice.  Yeah, it happened maybe 500 meters from where I live.
Q. Where do you live?
CLEMENT SORDET: I live in Nice.
Q. Where in Nice?
CLEMENT SORDET: It's close to the sea.  It's really close to the beach.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, well, my girlfriend.  I used to live in (indiscernible), but my girlfriend is from Nice, and she has family there.  It was a big party last night because it was the 14th of July, so we had a bunch of friends and it was my girlfriend's mom there.  They're safe now, so everything's okay.  Yeah, yeah, but I feel really bad for all of the other guys.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: Well, I'm going back in two weeks because I have two tournaments in the next two weeks.  So, yeah, I'll get back in three weeks.

Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: It's a pretty big city.  It's one of the biggest cities in France.  Yeah, that's all I can say.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: I'm really proud to be French, and I think we all need to support each other, and that's about it.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, just I say my prayers and that's it.
Q. (Inaudible).
CLEMENT SORDET: I really didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  It's nice.
Q. (Inaudible)?
CLEMENT SORDET: Not yet, it was really early this morning, so I bet we're going to have some stuff later.
