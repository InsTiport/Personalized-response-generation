Q. Good start here at the British Masters, nice way to close it out there at 18.
CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, it was a good 3-under.  I played really well.  It wasn't easy.  It was really windy, and this course is just not easy.  You've got to keep the ball in play and hopefully stay on the fairway.
Q. How tough is this golf course, especially when the breeze picks up?
CLEMENT SORDET: It is, it is, because it's really very open, and the Heath is not easy because if you get it out there, it's like pitching wedge -- it's almost like dependent on the tee shot, so it's kind of hard.
Q. What do you feel you did well to be able to shoot 3-under today?
CLEMENT SORDET: Well, I started really well because the first few holes are kind of tough and you have to hit the ball in the fairway, so I did that, and I managed to make some birdies and shot 3-under on the front, and then the back nine was kind of different because it's almost straight downwind, and I managed to shoot even par.
Q. A couple of good results the last two weeks off the back of some missed cuts.  Has something clicked recently for you?
CLEMENT SORDET: Yeah, I've been playing better lately.  I didn't manage to get some great results, but there's two tournaments left, and we'll see at the end.
