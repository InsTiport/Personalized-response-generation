Q. Coming off a 67, you had to feel good coming into today.JONATHAN GARRICK: I felt pretty good.  Obviously I want to play as well as I can but I knew I could just kind of not press too hard in order to put myself in a good position. So I never really got in trouble.  I just didn't make as many birdie putts as I would have liked, but felt good to pick up a couple birdies on the back nine.Q. Was there a conscious effort to be conservative?JONATHAN GARRICK: I was definitely pretty conservative.  I just hit to the fat part of the green.  I gave myself a lot of 20-, 25-foot putts, and I figured if I had that every hole, I would make a few and hopefully shoot under par.  So fairly conservative.Q. You just came off a good performance at the Canadian Amateur.  You lost in a playoff but you had a good week.  Was there a lot of confidence coming off of that?JONATHAN GARRICK: There was a lot.  Had been playing well lately but has not been showing and last week to see it showing for 72 holes was a huge confidence boost.  I'm carrying it over to this event just playing with a lot more confidence than I have been the last few months.Q. What was the best thing you did today?JONATHAN GARRICK: The best thing I did today was probably making that 16-foot birdie putt on the last hole.  I've been burning edges all day and to finish up with the birdie and post a red number, that was huge.
