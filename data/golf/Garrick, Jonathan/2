Q. Well done.JONATHAN GARRICK: Thank you.Q. What was the best thing about the round?JONATHAN GARRICK: I hit every fairway today.  I guess I did miss one fairway, but it wasn't with the driver.  With driver, I hit every single fairway and gave myself a lot of short irons, a lot of scoring opportunities, and just kind of pretty stress-free round.Q. How much driver did you use?JONATHAN GARRICK: I hit driver on every hole except two, two holes.Q. Okay.JONATHAN GARRICK: So hit 12 drivers and split the fairway 12 times.Q. That's good.  You should be smiling more.JONATHAN GARRICK: I've still got a long way to go, still got a long way.Q. I heard you talking about Match Play and stuff.  This is a nice start when Match Play is the goal that you want to get to anyway, right?JONATHAN GARRICK: Yeah.  It's like two separate tournaments.  Once stroke play, and I understand, once stroke play is over, number 64 has the same chance as number 1.  So I'm taking it a day at a time.Q. Did you feel like splitting the fairway was in your future when you woke up this morning?JONATHAN GARRICK: I did.  I've been driving the ball extremely well the past week or so, so I know exactly what to feel to hit fairways which is a pretty cool feeling.
