Q.   Can you talk about playing with Mr.Lewis, did y'all have any type of friendship or history?
TOM JENKINS:   Yeah, we live in Austin together and we used to practice quite a bit kind of before the Champions Tour days at a place that we lived.   So we spent a lot of time together back then, although our paths have kind of gone kind of opposite directions a little bit the last four or five years, but I still see him out here and stuff and I still consider him a good friend.

Q.   Did you play around the same time in college together?
TOM JENKINS:   No, I think I'm quite a bit older than he is.   I'm 64.   I don't know how old JL is.   So I'm sure I'm the next generation.   How old is he?   51?   So I'm, you know, I'm his grandfather.
