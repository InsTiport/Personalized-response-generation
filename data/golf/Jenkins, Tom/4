Q.
With your great finishes the last two weeks, what does that do for your confidence coming into a Major championship like this?
TOM JENKINS:  Well, it certainly is an advantage, I think.  I've had a third place and second place and I feel like I'm playing well.

Major championships are always a little bit different.  The golf courses are certainly more of a championship quality than your average tournament.  Here you have to drive the ball well, hit good iron shots into the right parts of the greens and then you got to putt well.  It's a long event, four rounds, walking the entire week.  It's going to be a grind.  The back nine here is a pretty tough walk.  I feel good about it.  The main thing is get off to a good start and hit some solid golf shots and give your self some opportunities for some birdies and then see what happens on Sunday.
Q.  Overall, what do you think of the venue?
TOM JENKINS:  Oh, it's wonderful.  Ever since the PGA has gone to rotating the golf courses, it's been a pleasure.  Some of these courses, they used to play back in Major championships on the Regular TOUR and I missed a lot of those.  I didn't play in some of the Majors back then.  And now getting a chance to play some of these old, historic venues is just marvelous.
