 Q.   First off, what happened?   
BEN CRANE:   Just been battling a disk injury, and just got to where I couldn't play.   
   
 Q.   Is there a particular moment or a swing?   
BEN CRANE:   It was coming on.   I just felt it coming on.   
   
 Q.   Obviously disappointing, especially considering playing well early today, and not being able to move on, just disappointed?   
BEN CRANE:   Yeah, just disappointed.   Just bummed.   I mean, I just figured some stuff out this week, and was really excited about it.   And it showed up in the first round, and then, you know, obviously not feeling good prevents you from doing what you want to do.   There's a learn level of pain that you just can't take anymore.   
   
 Q.   It wasn't just a particular swing, just something that's been gradual?   
BEN CRANE:   Well, every swing.   
   
 Q.   Moving forward, you've got a couple weeks now to get it worked on, and then get right back it with the start of the next season, I would imagine.   
BEN CRANE:   Yeah, just evaluate, see how everything looks, and get back after it, hopefully Fall Series.   
   
 Q.   Is it lower back? Upper back?   
BEN CRANE:   Lower back.
