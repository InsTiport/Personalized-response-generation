  Q.  Nice match today against Davis Love.  He's had a lot of success here, so you've got to be pretty proud of yourself.   
 BEN CRANE:  Yeah, I played well.  I really didn't make that many mistakes, and when I did make a mistake I was able to recover from it.  So really excited to getting off to a good start.   
  
  Q.  Any turning point in the match?   
 BEN CRANE:  I hit a ball left of the green on, I don't know what it was, 12ish or something like that, and it landed on the fringe or it was going to roll down into the collection area.  My ball held up in a sprinkler and I got a drop and placed it right next to the green.   
 At the time I was 1-down.  I made the putt from about 20 feet to pull the match all square, and that felt like a good -- like a momentum turner at the moment.   
  
  Q.  You said you're playing well.  What are you doing well?   
 BEN CRANE:  I've been hitting the ball better than I've ever hit it, which has been amazing the last two weeks.  But I've missed both cuts and my short game was atrocious.  I came here with the idea of I don't really need to hit any balls.   
 Just play a few holes and figure out how to putt and chip again and I was able to work on that and had a friend come in and help me, and it made a big difference today.  I was able to hole a lot of putts and chip well.
