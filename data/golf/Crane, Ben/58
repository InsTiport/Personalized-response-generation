  Q. I presume you had a chance to watch the conference this morning, what were your thoughts about what Tiger had to say?  
 BEN CRANE: Well, one of the first things that came to my mind is one of my favorite stories in the Bible talks about a woman who has sinned and she's been a prostitute and she -- everyone brings her before Jesus and says shouldn't we stone her? Shouldn't we kill her for all these bad things that she's done? And Jesus says, yes, absolutely, stone her. But you without sin be the one to cast the first stone. And that's my favorite story.   
 And you know what, I thought it was an amazing conference. I thought Tiger was very humble. And, you know what, I think we all love him as a golfer and as a family man. And we want to see what's best for him, and I think everything he did is going to help him get back soon and help him.
