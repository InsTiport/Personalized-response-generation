 Q. Ben, well played through two days, especially today. 5-under par, what were the conditions like out on the golf course?
 BEN CRANE: This course is one of the best we play all year, if not the best. It's in great shape. The greens are pure. And the greens are small. You've got to golf your ball around here. You've got to position your ball so well off the fairway. You might be hitting a 15-yard draw with a club or a fade. It's just a fun golf course to play. You really never know what you're going to get. It's just one of the players' favorites that we love coming to.

 Q. It's a different golf course because there are a lot of tight holes. Do you think this is a course that fits into your game?
 BEN CRANE: I do. I've improved by accuracy quite a bit. This year and last year have really been fairly accurate with my drivers and irons. I'm up there in greens and fairways, so that helps around this place, just to get the ball in position. If you do get the ball on the greens, the greens are small and you're going to have an opportunity to make one.

 Q. There's an unusual stretch on the golf course, holes 8 through 13 where there are six straight par-4s. Doesn't happen a lot on the courses we play on Tour. Is that something you think about? My thoughts are you've got to be under par on those six holes. 
 BEN CRANE: I've never thought about it that philosophically. But, yeah, that is a tough stretch. And you get some short par-4s, you get some doglegs left, doglegs right, so there's a variety. You've hitting a bunch of different clubs off the tee. They don't feel like six consecutive par-4s. We love coming here, it's a great track.

 Q. Good luck this weekend. 
 BEN CRANE: Thanks.
