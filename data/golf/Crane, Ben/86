BEN CRANE:  I played real nice today.  I capitalized on some opportunities I had and knocked a few balls real close with my approaches, so I had some easy birdies early, which kind of got my momentum rolling and it just kind of felt good from there.
Q.  Do you like where you are going into this weekend?
BEN CRANE:  Absolutely.  Any time you're around the lead, it's fun, and Saturday is the big day where you've got to get yourself in position, and after tomorrow I'd like to be in position and have a chance at it on Sunday.
Q.  Mentally, what do you do going into the weekend?  How are you on yourself?
BEN CRANE:  Well, I think you really try not to do anything different than you do the first couple days and just try to do things in my game, the small things, to put myself in position and to -- I'll go work on my putting a little bit from here and just try to keep my game fresh so I can play my way in.
Q.  What was the biggest difference in the course that you were able to use to your advantage?
BEN CRANE:  You mean this year versus last year?
Q.  From yesterday to today.
BEN CRANE:  The rain really softens up the greens and now all of a sudden some of these pins that are tucked on the corners, you can access them with some good shots, whereas yesterday you could be hitting great shots but with firm greens and the wind blowing the way it was, it's tough to get the ball close to the hole.  Not only hitting shots, but when the wind is blowing it's tough to putt.  It's blowing your putts off-line.

Today the course doesn't have as much of a defense so you're able to be a little bit more aggressive on every shot.
