  Q. Nice 68, didn't get off to a good start, but you kept plugging.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, I really had some struggles this week and some big bumps in the road. I was able to overcome just some tough circumstances, so I'm really proud of the week. Finished strong again today, which just makes for an exciting week.  
  
  Q. This golf course will do that to you; it will knock you down, although it will give you chances to come back.   
 BEN CRANE: It does. This is one of the best golf courses we play. The condition is fabulous. And the wind on top of that makes it that much more of a test.   
 I love every hole out there, and I don't really say that about many courses. Just a great venue. Honda does a great job. It's really been a great week.  
  
  Q. Especially No. 5 on Saturday.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, No. 5 on Saturday was one of those shots you'll remember for the rest of your life.  
  
  Q. But then it took one away from you today.   
 BEN CRANE: It did. That's just kind of the way the game goes. You never know.   
  
  Q. How about your game, it seems to be just getting sharper and sharper every week.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, I've put a lot of work in with my instructor, and I am playing better than I have ever played. I'm physically fit more than I ever and working with my mental coach. I just feel like everything I'm doing, I'm just going the right direction. I'm trying not to press for results, just keep plugging away and I'm really encouraged after a great finish today. Praise God, I'm feeling great. It's been a fun year so far.
