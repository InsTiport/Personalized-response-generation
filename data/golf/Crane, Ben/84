BEN CRANE:  You know, I played well all day.  I got off to a great start on my second hole and made a 25 footer, and that just opened it up a little bit for me and was able to shoot 5 under on that back nine which is pretty good for me.
Q.  There's been a few people who have complained about the course a little bit, any complaints from you?
BEN CRANE:  You know, I think this golf course is one of best golf courses we play all year.  I mean, I can't think of a better golf course.  There's a couple holes that there's some things that can happen that are a little unfair, maybe the tree on 11 on your approach.  I saw something happen with DiMarco I thought that's unfair; he hit a perfect second shot yesterday, but it's as good and as fair a golf course as we play all year.
Q.  So you haven't had any problems or issues with rough around the greens?
BEN CRANE:  You know, the rough is brutal.  I mean, it's    and what makes it tough sometimes is it's hard underneath the long grass.  So it's hard to get your club underneath the ball when it's sitting so far down sometimes, so you get that ball that kind of comes out hot with no spin so it can be tough to control.  Today I managed to avoid it most of the day which certainly helped and was able to turn in a good score.
Q.  Inaudible?
BEN CRANE:  You know I don't even really think about that.  I'm just trying to go along and play the best round I can.  It was fun to three 5 under in on that side.  It was pretty good for me.
Q.  Inaudible?
BEN CRANE:  I tell you what, I've got my whole family and a few friends out.

It's funny how when I make a putt or something like that, I hear my family cheering.  It's a little different.
Q.  How many?
BEN CRANE:  There's maybe probably ten of us.
