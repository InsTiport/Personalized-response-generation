   BEN CRANE: It was a great day, fun day. You know, hot out there. The course was in really good shape and was able to execute well today despite my outfit.  
  
  Q. I know about your stay-in-the-moment thing. You actually have a code shot to shot, you grade yourself how you stay in the moment for each shot?  
 BEN CRANE: We do. I mean, that's kind of part of our process. Yeah, that's our goal is to individually work towards each shot, stay in the moment, and obviously if you do that, then collectively you're in good shape. Moment by moment, we try to do our best and then move on. I mean, the old clichÃ©, one shot at a time, everyone talks about it, but truly if we can do that, we're going to be better off.  
  
  Q. And you had to do it this afternoon because course conditions changed from when you teed it up early this afternoon and the greens were a little bit receptive when you started, but I'm sure by the back nine with the wind and the sun they firmed up.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, they did. We started getting some hole locations where we started playing some bounces in to back pins and really had to protect ourselves from going over in those situations. You play a little more defensively when the greens firm up, and certainly this weekend if they don't put the sprinklers on, I think it's going to be an awfully tough test of golf this weekend.  
  
  Q. When you see 12-under par in the lead, do you think to yourself I have ground to make up, or do you think to yourself I know this course is going to get tougher the last two days?   
 BEN CRANE: Maybe you see 12-under par. I'm not looking at any of that.   
  
  Q. You didn't look?   
 BEN CRANE: No, I'm not looking. I'm trying to stick to my program, and hats off to whoever is 12-under par. That's good playing out there.
