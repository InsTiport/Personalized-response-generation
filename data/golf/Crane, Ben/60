 Q. There's a lot of unusual things to happen in golf, but is that unusual winning a match after one hole?
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, it felt weird. He came up to me and said I'm not feeling good. It doesn't look good. So you kind of just try to stay with what you're doing. And he obviously had the flu and was just feeling awful, had the cold sweats and everything. There was no handshakes going on. And we just played the first hole and then they said I could keep playing and get a practice round in. I was really looking forward to, obviously, the match, but obviously nice to be moving on to the next round.

 Q. How many more holes did you play?
 BEN CRANE: I played 9, came in and had a nice casual lunch.

 Q. Did it completely take you by surprise, did you notice he was not feeling good round?
 BEN CRANE: Well, we have the same physio, and so they were telling me that he wasn't feeling good and so -- but I still expected him to play. I just didn't know exactly -- it didn't take me completely by surprise just knowing he was sick.

 Q. Have you ever witnessed anything like this happening before in a situation you've been involved in? It is pretty unusual. 
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, it is very usual unusual. No, I don't think I have. I was able to get a few more holes in, since this is my first time here at this golf course. We had a good time with the crowd laughing and kept telling them to place their bets on whether I was going to win the hole or not and just having fun with the crowd, you know. They said where's your partner? I said, who? Where did he go? I just had some fun with him.

 Q. It was a good practice round?
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, everyone else's match is so intense and I'm just out there goofing around and hitting some balls. The crowd was just loving it.
