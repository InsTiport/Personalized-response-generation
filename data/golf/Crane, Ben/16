 Q.  It was quite the roller coaster that back nine for you.  Were you thinking about what you needed to do to move on to the BMW Championship?  BEN CRANE: No are question it was in the back of my mind, but I kept thinking I was right around the number.  I thought the birdie on 17 was to get me inside.  And then we got to 18 and Joel said if we make four or five we're okay either way.  So we go with an aggressive play, got a little grass behind the ball there, and just didn't quite catch it clean.  I was going, okay, this is not going to work out, with making a mess of the last hole.  But looked like it still will.  Looks like I'm going to finish 70th.   Q.  Like Tom Petty says, the waiting is the hardest part.  How difficult is it when you walked down to scoring, kind of uncertain where you were going to be next week?  BEN CRANE: Yeah, thankfully we got some help from the Tour in there telling us exactly where we are finishing.  I don't think there's anyone on the golf course that can pass me.  Everybody is already done.  So we're running out of guys who can pass me.  They said they couldn't think of a scenario where I would go to 71.  But you never know.  Crazier things have happened, so you never know.  I've got a flight to Nashville, home, or I've got a flight to Denver.  And I'd like to go to Denver, but we'll see.
