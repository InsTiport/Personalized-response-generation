   BEN CRANE: It was just a really tough thing there to get behind the hole there. It's just a treacherous spot to putt down from. 15 green seems to be a little bit firmer, as well. Anyway, I also think there's some birdies out there. I think on the back nine there's a few pins there that -- 13, 16, I think, that will help funnel the ball down towards the hole with quality shots. I think we're going so see some good scoring on the back nine if people get the ball in the right position.  
  
  Q. Is there any wind at all, or is it similar to yesterday?  
 BEN CRANE: You know, it's unbelievable. This is the best weather I've seen here in all of my three years here. But really it's been perfect weather pretty much all week.   
 I think the wind swirls back there on 11, 12 and 13 a little bit, which can cause havoc. But for the most part the gusts are five, ten miles an hour at the most, so pretty calm day.  
  
  Q. You've got to be pretty happy with your finish.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, I just came out here with the idea of having some fun and enjoying the fact that I'm in the Masters. I couldn't be more pleased with just the way I've been playing, and to have a great round today was just icing on the cake for me, so I'm just very pleased.
