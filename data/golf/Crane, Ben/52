  Q. Solid start, six birdies, no bogeys, good way to start the year.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, that was a little unexpected. I felt like I was just a little bit rusty but really thrilled with the way I played and made some nice putts to kind of keep the round going. Little 25-footer on 17 helped.  
  
  Q. I know you've been here before. How did this golf course play with not very much wind out there?  
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, it's like a different golf course. You know, the golf course is generally the easy holes are hard with the wind and the hard holes are a little bit easier with the wind, just depending on which way you have it going. It's just a different course. Sometimes you're hitting 3-wood into some of these par-4s and sometimes you're hitting wedges. For the most part it was just kind of a nice break from the heavy wind.  
  
  Q. What's up with the karaoke video?  
 BEN CRANE: That was just kind of on a limb, Brian said, hey, you want to do a little karaoke? There was a guy singing. It was not good. So I think the strategy was if we put a guy up there that isn't any good at all, someone will take his place. So it was like willed out of us. Brian and I couldn't help it. We just had to get up there and get the party started, and that was about it. All of a sudden I guess Ian was in the back videoing, and now we're on Twitter.
