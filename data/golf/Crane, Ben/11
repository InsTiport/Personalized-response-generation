  BEN CRANE:   I got off to a great start, you know, the start you want, and was just playing solid and felt like hey, I can move up quite a bit on this golf course just because pars are at a premium here with the rough and the demand hitting the fairway and the greens being firm and fast.  
All in all, played really well.   And I came in here with my game in little rough shape, so I felt like I found some form for, you know, portions of the week which was super encouraging, so definitely takes some confidence going forward the rest of the year.  
   
 Q.   What was this week like for coming in as the defending champ?  
BEN CRANE:   Couldn't have been any better.   Same housemates.   Cameron Tringale and Chesson Hadley and Steven cooking for us.   The same routine.   Just so many good friends here now that we're living in Tennessee.   Some friends came over, and so it's just a really, really fun week.   Lot of friends here at the tournament.   Certainly Phil Cannon is a good buddy, and he's done an unbelievable job, the staff and grounds crew.   Never seen the course in better shape.   They're putting on a world class event here.   It's fun to be back and fun to be a past champ, make the cut and do some good things to have a pretty good week overall.  
   
 Q.   Nice comeback from yesterday, too.   Finish on a good note.  
BEN CRANE:   Yeah.
