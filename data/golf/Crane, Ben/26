Q.   Valiant effort all the way to the very end.   Got to be feeling good about the week overall.
BEN CRANE:   Yeah.   I played great all week, and, you know, I just -- progress, not perfection.   You know, there's no greater joy than just playing on Easter Sunday and just putting this whole game in perspective and just praise God for what He did on the cross and being raised from the dead so that we could experience life and joy and peace in this life, and I definitely had that today.   So, it was just a fun day to be out there with a friend and watch make that amazing putt on the last hole.   That was pretty cool.
