  Q. I understand you kept the momentum going on some difficult holes, 13 and 14.   
 BEN CRANE: I did. I made a couple mistakes off the tee there and just got myself out of position and ended up hitting it in the hazard on one hole and chipped it up to 15 feet and made the putt for par and had another like 12-footer that broke two and a half feet for par. I made a couple of key putts to keep the round going. Overall putted well and hit the ball close a few times and had a few tap-ins which always seems to get the momentum going.  
  
  Q. There's some things more important other than golf this week for you.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, I've definitely got my mind half here and half at home. My wife is nine months pregnant, due with a scheduled C-section on Monday. We're keeping in close contact, and if mama calls, we're going to get out of here and go home and have our third child. We're extremely excited.
