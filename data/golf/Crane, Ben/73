  Q. 1-over par for the tournament, that's a good score, even par today.   
 BEN CRANE: Yeah, I played the best golf I played all year today, and I had a chance to post a score. I mean, first of all, I'm extremely happy with the way I played. I drove it great and I did everything right except I can't capitalize on a few 10-, 12-, 15-footers, even 6-footers; that if I would have made them on the back nine there, I could have posted a score which would have been really fun.  
 Overall, I'm healthy and my back is feeling good, and my game is coming around, so I'm encouraged.  
  
  Q. That score is going to continue to climb up the leaderboard as the day continues; can you describe how difficult the conditions are?   
 BEN CRANE: I probably had six putts that I'm literally changing the read by the second as I stand over it.   
 So you know, when the greens are this fast, and you're standing over a putt that's a 6-footer, the read can go from right edge to a ball outside left in a gust, and so you're going to get out of position on some holes and to be able to capitalize and make those putts is a very difficult thing to do.
