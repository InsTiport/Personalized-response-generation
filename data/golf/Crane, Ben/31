Q.   Defending champion makes the big cut on the number and then ties the tournament course record here.   What changed between days one and two on this day?
BEN CRANE:   Well, we worked on our putting last night and this morning and just found a little something with my alignment that helped and went out there and started making 15, 20‑footers and all of a sudden I was 4‑under par on the first nine and just playing great. 
Really didn't hit it all that close to the hole.   Only really had one or two that were close, so other than that I was just making putts from the other side of the green, so it was fun.

Q.   Was this the same feeling you had as you made that great Back nine charge to win here, and will you need a similar round here in the final round to win again?
BEN CRANE:   I will.   I think I'll need a similar round to be able to do it again.   I figure I'll be at least four or five back.
And yeah, it was a similar feeling.   Obviously on Sunday it feels even better, you know, but it was all in all just a great day.   I'm just happy to get myself back in the tournament.   I was just feeling like I was kind of out of the tournament back there at 1‑under par starting out the day, but certainly with 62 today, we're back in it and get a late tee time tomorrow and see if I can get hot again.
