  Q. A hole-in-one, two double-bogeys, another birdie and a bogey; have you ever had a more up-and-down round that you can remember?   
 BEN CRANE: I don't think I have. It was just, you know, victorious, and it was just the pits, all in one round.   
 But all in all, it's just so much fun to be playing out here. I'm just trying to keep a positive attitude and move on. I play my best when I'm able to move on, from the good ones and the bad ones, and just take it for what it is.  
  
  Q. What's the mentality tomorrow with such a tight leaderboard? Guys can jump up or drop off in a moment's in the.   
 BEN CRANE: That's the beauty of this golf course, it's a fantastic layout and it's going to be a fun shootout and should be for a good telecast.   
  
  Q. What's the deal with the car now, what was the arrangement?   
 BEN CRANE: No question, if I make a hole-in-one, and I won the car, it goes right to my caddie. He's got an old car at home that I just keep telling him, hold off, hold off and maybe we'll make a hole-in-one. Unfortunately they didn't have a Honda sitting on that hole today, but we'll just keep plugging away at it.
