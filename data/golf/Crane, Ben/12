Q.   The wind picked up a little bit and played a little tougher this afternoon.
BEN CRANE:   I got in the rough a number of times.   I'll tell you what, this is no golf course to play from the rough.   It makes it so difficult.   You get a lot of fliers, hard to control the ball.   Scrambling around these greens is just incredibly difficult with the rough around the greens.   Grainy lies.   It makes some of the guys look silly.   I'm telling you, this is a tough golf course right now.   It's drying out and, you know, I mean, I think single digits might even win this tournament.   Kind of depends what a few guys do.   It is a very tough test of golf right now.

Q.   Talk about your round today a little bit.
BEN CRANE:   Just a lot of ups and downs, you know.   I got myself in some trouble.   I was able to bounce back, make a few birdies.   Made a couple shots from off the green, which always gives you a little momentum boost.   Chipped in on 17 from off the green and made a long one on 10 from off the green.   So, those kind of got me back in so I could salvage an even par round.
