Q.
You weren't on the clock on 17.  What happened, from your perspective, on 17 with Rory.
BEN CRANE:  Rory was frustrated because we were on the clock, and I understand that.  At 17 we were back in position because we were on the tee, and they were still on the green.  Technically we were off the clock.  So Rory wanted to keep playing, and that's fine.  I understand he's frustrated and I feel bad.  I can't change the situation, but I am the one who caused the problem.  So there you have it.
Q.
You finished up pretty strong there and had a pretty good week, especially considering the year you've had.  How do you feel?
BEN CRANE:  I'm encouraged.  I'm really encouraged.  We've been working hard on my game, my teacher, Butch, and the guys at Titleist have worked so hard getting my back going again.  I've got nothing for praise for my therapist, Tom.  Guys who have done nothing but help me.  It's been probably a tough time, but yet I feel I'm finally over the hump.  And I'm excited about that.
Q.
Rory is one of the faster players on Tour and you're one of the slower players on Tour.  You say it's frustrated for him.  Is it awkward for you to play with someone who wants to play so fast?  Do you feel rushed?
BEN CRANE:  No, that's one of the reasons why I'm working hard to pick it up, not only will it be better for my playing partners, but better for me also.  I'm doing all I can.  I need to work on picking up the pace and I understand that.
Q.
Did Rory say anything to you?  Did he tell you what he was going to do on 17?
BEN CRANE: No, he just wanted to get going, so he started playing ahead.  That's fine.  He was frustrated.  I understand.
Q.
Was it distracting to you having the two of them standing on the green?  That ordinarily doesn't happen.
BEN CRANE:  I just tried to do what I know how to do, and that's get over the shot and hit the best shot I could.  That's really what it was all about.  If someone is still, it's not a big deal.  If someone is moving around    but he wasn't moving around, so it was okay.
Q.
Somebody mentioned as a marker you're slower than the other players and you need to watch them hole out.  Is that the case?
BEN CRANE:  I don't think so.  I think we're okay.  He knows by the applause and everything, and I think he was watching that I made 4 on 16.  I don't think there is any situation.
Q.
He was upset?
BEN CRANE:  Well, of course, that adds to the situation.  Understandably so.
