  Q.  Just talk about 10, you ended up in the bunker.   
 BEN CRANE:  With the way the green's pitched and the way the green slants from front to back there, it's probably the best hole I've ever played.  I would say that there's so much risk/reward there, and it's really a thinking man's shot off the tee.   
 There's so many different ways you can play.  You can hit driver and try to hit it over the green and try to hit it back into the slope or lay back and try to fit a wedge in there; but if you do that you have to go left because the green angles from front to back.  It's just a great hole.   
 Any time you hit your tee shot and see where it goes, you know what you have for your next shot because the back part of the green slopes away from you.  It's a great hole.   
  
  Q.  You got a little unlucky in the bunker.   
 BEN CRANE:  I hit in the front bunker there and I knew going in there that the bunker shot was going to slope away from me, so I was going to have to hit a really good shot and I actually thought, it's such a tough shot and so firm, I thought if I hit a really good shot, I'll be able to stop it next to the hole; and if not, it's going to run to the back bunker.  But the back bunker is a place where you can get up-and-down from, so I thought, okay, I'll try to be aggressive and go for it and was a bit aggressive and came up just short but was still able to make par.   
 I think if you want to make a course and make everyone even on the playing field, make every hole like No. 10, because then it would just be a shootout and you would see 6s and 3s and 2s, and you would see every number in the book.  It's a great hole.
