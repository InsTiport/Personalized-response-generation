Q. So what do you think, you won a million Wyndham Rewards Points.
BEN CRANE: It's pretty awesome.  So cool you know, playing Sunday here at the Wyndham Championship, such an unbelievable event.  Stayed with some great friends.  It's been a special week.
And then, you know, kind of playing pretty good but need something to get over the hump.  Got to 16 there and hit a beautiful shot.  As soon as I hit it, "Oh, be right, baby."
Sure enough it landed two paces short there and rolled in just like a putt.  You know, most PGA players, I have to brag, because don't nail the celebration but Billy Horschel and I did a lot of choreography work beforehand and nailed it, did the right high fives, the caddies did the right high fives.
We celebrated the Wyndham sign with a million points is right there.  It was awesome.  We had a lot of fun with it.
Q. Just the week in general.
BEN CRANE: Incredible.  You know, Wyndham has done a great job with this event.  The golf course is spectacular, a very fun course to play.  Since we switched to bermuda here, turned out to be one of the best events on the PGA TOUR.  My boy, Mark Brazil, crushing it and so, yeah, it's a special week.  Love coming here and be coming back or as many years as they let me.
