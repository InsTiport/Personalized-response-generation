 Q.  How hard is it to come back the next day after not finishing? 
 BEN CRANE:  Oh, I mean, it's just part of the program.  I mean, we have to do it now and then.  With the frost delays and stuff, it's just one of those things, part of the program.  You'd prefer not to be teeing off at oh dark 30 and getting out there when it's just a little colder.  It's all about temperature here.  It's just a little colder so you have to wear a few more layers and all that, but all in all, the course is in good shape.  We'll have some good greens in the morning.  It shouldn't be a big deal. 

 Q.  Does it matter how many holes you have to finish, one or four? 
 BEN CRANE:  No.  Of course the fewer holes you play in the cold, the better, I guess.  But all in all, it's still golf, and the ball might fly maybe 5 percent shorter, but that's about it.
