KYLE STANLEY: Greens are rolling pretty good.  My iron game has been pretty solid so give myself quite a few chances and trying to play some stress-free golf.   
 Q.  How different was the golf course from yesterday morning when you played -- yesterday afternoon?  
KYLE STANLEY: Not that much different.  I mean the greens are just really firm, they're fast.  So, that's kind of the course's defense right now is fast, firm greens, and some of these pin locations just have to be careful where you leave the ball on the green.   
You could have 12 feet on the wrong side of the pin or 25 feet on the correct side and you want that 25-footer.  So, just got to be smart about it when you fight your way around here.   
 Q.  127 coming into the week.  Now you're well inside that.  Mission accomplished right now?  
KYLE STANLEY: I guess so.  Kind of hard not to think about it but, you know, getting to the weekend part is done and at this point got to stay out of my way and keep doing what I'm doing.   
 Q.  Good luck on the weekend.  
KYLE STANLEY: Thanks.  Appreciate it.   
 Q.  What was the challenge like of playing just knowing that what was on the line here on a day like this?  
KYLE STANLEY: I mean kind of in the back of your head so it's a little bit different than, you know, playing, and I'm playing well.  I knew I was playing well.  Feel pretty comfortable on this golf course.  Feel like I have a good plan on how I want to play the course.  I just try to focus on committing to that most of the day.
