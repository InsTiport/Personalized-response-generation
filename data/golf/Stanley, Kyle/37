Q.   How aware of the standings were you today?   What was your thinking? 
KYLE STANLEY:   I mean, yeah, I didn't pay too much attention to it.   I knew I needed to make a couple coming in on the back nine.   I knew that.   Other than that, I knew I probably needed to make par on 18.

Q.   Is this a different kind of pressure than you're used to feeling? 
KYLE STANLEY:   Not really.   I don't really know what I feel right now.   I've felt pretty stale, I guess, for quite some time here.   We'll see what happens.   Hopefully we'll get on through here, and that might power things up a little bit.
