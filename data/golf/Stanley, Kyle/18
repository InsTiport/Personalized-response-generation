Q. What do you take out of the round, obviously Saturday at THE PLAYERS and this stage?
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, I thought I handled it pretty well after the poor start.  2-over through 4, just had to remind myself to stay pretty patient.  I thought it played really difficult on the front nine with as windy as it was.  But the birdie on 8 kind of the settled me down a little bit and then just tried to keep things pretty simple after that, back to my game plan of fairways and greens.
Q. Talk about 17 on the back nine.  What a shock to get it there and then you got to be happy, you've been playing that hole really well in this kind of environment?
KYLE STANLEY: For sure.  We have done a nice job, Brian's done a nice job of judging the wind there all week.  Today was a perfect number.  I think to just keep it short of that top slope, we had 134, so a little downwind, 130 club, my gap wedge.  It set up pretty nice to where I could go ahead and take a pretty aggressive line, but I'll take 2 there any day.
