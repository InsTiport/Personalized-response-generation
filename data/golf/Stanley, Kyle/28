 Q.   A 66 in the third round.   That's some tremendous scoring out there in some adverse conditions, and that front nine was tremendous for you, especially the eagle there at 2.   Tell us about it.   
KYLE STANLEY:   Yeah, I got off to a good start, birdied 1, and the chip‑in on 2 was nice.   To be 3‑under after 2 on this golf course was a nice way to start.   But I gave myself tons of opportunities out there.   I feel like I left some on the golf course, which is probably a good thing.   But I'm hitting it great right now, feel pretty good about my game, and just got to keep playing.   
   
 Q.   Give me your impressions of this golf course and playing in this wonderful old championship here in Canada.   
KYLE STANLEY:   Yeah, you know, it's very scorable.   You know, if you hit it‑‑ if you hit it quite a ways off the tee, most of these par‑5s are really par‑4s to be honest with you.   You're hitting mid‑irons, sometimes even short irons into them.   It played kind of soft today, but the greens were rolling good speed.   It's a lot of wedges into par‑5s and is pretty scorable, so you can go low for sure.
