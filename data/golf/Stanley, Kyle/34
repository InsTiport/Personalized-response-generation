 Q.   Kyle, what a nice round of golf out of you.   What a great start.   Tell me about that eagle at 2?   
KYLE STANLEY:   Thank you.   I went long.   It's probably not the best miss, but kind of bumped a 4‑iron up to the fringe and it went in.   So it was definitely a nice way to start.  
   
 Q.   You just pounded the ball into greens this week.   You took 43 of 54 and you're giving yourself a lot of birdie looks.   
KYLE STANLEY:   Yeah, my ball striking has been there.   But it's been no different than it has been.   Just the putter, I've kind of gotten that going this week, which is nice.   I'm giving myself a lot of looks and taking advantage of it.  
   
 Q.   65 here on Saturday; how pleased are you?   
KYLE STANLEY:   Yeah, very.   Pretty steady round of golf.   Didn't give myself much trouble.   Had a nice start, 3‑under through 3, and I just kept giving myself looks and made some good putts.  
   
 Q.   What is the condition of this golf course?   This morning it looked pretty easy, and then did the wind start picking up?   
KYLE STANLEY:   Yeah, this morning was pretty benign.   Not much going on out there, not a lot of wind.   So you could pretty much take dead aim and hit a lot of pins.   Those last four or five, the wind picked up.  
17 is playing very tough.   That's a right to left wind.   Yeah, it played a little more difficult as it picked up, but overall scoring conditions are pretty good.  
   
 Q.   This year probably hasn't been what you're looking for.   What are you most looking forward to tomorrow?   
KYLE STANLEY:   I'm just kind of excited to be back in this position.   I've been lacking a little bit of confidence, but I was trying to build that back up through just being focused and good preparation.   Just kind of consuming myself in the process, and kind of taking the results out of it.
