 Q. Just talk in general about your round today and the strong points. 
 KYLE STANLEY: It was windy. I did a really good job controlling my golf ball. That I did well. I think I made three or four putts over 20 feet for birdie, so that was nice. But yeah, pretty much just did a good job on the greens.

 Q. And your putting, have you been struggling a little bit this year?
 KYLE STANLEY: I mean, I haven't been putting my best, but I'm taking a little different approach into this week and just trying to be natural, trying to free myself up on the greens a little bit, just see the line and hit it, try not to think about anything on the greens. 

 Q. The wind, did it change a lot throughout the round? 
 KYLE STANLEY: Not really. It got swirling a little bit on the back nine, but in the afternoon it was pretty strong.

 Q. Are you surprised that there's four or five guys at 5-under? Were you surprised given the wind that scores were that low?
 KYLE STANLEY: Not really. A couple of them were probably in the morning. Yeah, if you keep it in the fairway here you can score. 

 Q. And just general thoughts on the course? 
 KYLE STANLEY: It's nice. I like it. Second year here, so just glad to be here.
