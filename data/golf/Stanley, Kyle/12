Q. Nothing like easing in to match play, right?  That was a grinder all the way to the end.
KYLE STANLEY: It was.  I mean, both of us were really just trying to hang in there on the front nine.  It was pretty sloppy golf.  But yeah, just trying to hang in there all day.
It's a pretty tricky golf course.  Each green has four or five different tiers.  It's just tough and the wind picked up on the back.  So tried to keep it in front of us.
We knew pars were pretty good scores today.  Nice to make a little comeback there at the end, at the very last.
Q. Talk about your strategy on the 18.  You certainly had the distance to reach the green.  Why did you lay-up to the middle there?
KYLE STANLEY: I just wanted to give ourselves a chance of making a 3.  I really haven't been driving the ball well today, so I thought that it -- based on how I had been driving it, it may have been a tad bit of an aggressive play.  So I figured I would leave ourselves a wedge.  Playing downwind so that was going to make the shot a little bit easier.  I had a pretty good number.
Q. That's an easy hole location to get close to.  You hit a beautiful shot there, putt straight.  You took your normal routine on that.  Looked like the hole was giant for you at the end.
KYLE STANLEY: I don't know about that.  But the putt didn't have much break to it.  It is just inside left and put a good roll on it.  Nice way to end the day.
