 Q.  Solid way to close it out at 17.  You took the lead on the 4th or 5th hole in this match.  He made a couple of runs, but you always had an answer for him.  
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, he did.  He made a good birdie at 10 on the par-5 12th, so the tide was starting to turn there a little bit.   
I missed a short putt on 15, but thankfully I was able to recover on 16, made a good birdie putt.  But, yeah, overall I feel like when I had good birdie looks; I was for the most part making them.   
So didn't play as difficult today, there wasn't much wind, so the golf course probably played a little bit easier.  But Sergio obviously, great competitor.  So happy to be going through.   
 Q.  Justin Thomas up next, your thoughts on that match?  
KYLE STANLEY: I mean, he's probably the best player in the world right now, so I definitely have my work cut out for me.  But we'll just keep trying for more of the same and keep doing what we've been doing.
