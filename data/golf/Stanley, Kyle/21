Q. Kyle, great start to the tournament, 6-under par, 66 today.  If I can get some comments on your round.
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah.  Played well.  Putted well, made a couple long ones, which was nice.  These greens are always good.  Had some mud balls to deal with.  Other than that, with the rain yesterday, the greens were a little bit more receptive, so that's probably why the scoring was good.
Q. You had a really good stretch there on your front-9 on 15, 16, and 17.  Talk a little bit about that stretch, 3 birdies.
KYLE STANLEY: Had a lot of good looks leading up to that.  15 had about a 10-footer that went in.  Let's see.  16, made a long one there, kind of got away with one there.  Then, 17 playing a little bit shorter, had a gap wedge in and hit about a 5-footer.
Q. Everybody knows how tough 18 is here at this course.  It was your only slip-up today.  What happened on that hole?
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah.  Got my second shot a little bit heavy, ended up kind of bearing on the front of the green.  Tough putt from down there left it a little bit short.
Q. Recap the year for us.  Lot of solid starts for you this year.
KYLE STANLEY: Not too bad.  Been pretty consistent play-wise.  I feel healthy and, yeah, feel good.
Q. Keep it going.  Thanks, Kyle.
KYLE STANLEY: Thank you.
