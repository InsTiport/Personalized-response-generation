  Q. Just talk about your round.   
 KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, I played well. I putted well, got off to a good start again. I think I turned at 2. Made a nice eagle on 13 and just kind of carried that throughout the last few holes.  
  
  Q. How much do you pay attention to what's going on around you out there with the leaderboard and that stuff or is it just all about your round?  
 KYLE STANLEY: I didn't really pay too much attention to it today. I mean I think guys are making birdies, and if you're not doing that, you know you're going to lose ground.   
 So try to take advantage of these par-5s and some of these short par 4s you can leave wedges in your hands.  
  
  Q. Do you find yourself being more aggressive out there with the way the course is playing?  
 KYLE STANLEY: When you can. I thought it played a little more difficult with the wind. The course is firming up a good bit, so you just kind of have to go with what it gives you.  
  
  Q. What's it going to be like tomorrow looking up at Steve Stricker? What do you have to do mentally knowing that maybe four or five tomorrow might not be enough?  
 KYLE STANLEY: Well, I'm not really going to pay too much attention to that. I have a good game plan for this golf course. I've played it pretty well so far and I just gotta stick to what I'm doing, but yeah, I think everybody knows that you're going to have to shoot low tomorrow if you're going to have a chance.  
  
  Q. You tied for 34 two years ago. What's changed in your game?  
 KYLE STANLEY: Experience. I think that was my second or third event as a pro. I played nationwide all last year, and then this is my first full year out here. So just experience pretty much.
