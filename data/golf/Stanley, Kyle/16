 Q.  You're 19th in the FedExCup rankings, a terrific opening round of 67.  Really solid ball-striking.  Tell me what you felt was the strength of your game today.  
KYLE STANLEY: Well, I hit it well for starters, which was kind of key I guess, because it was pretty windy, and it's hard to get a judge on, you know, exactly which way the wind was going.  It seemed to switch several directions throughout the day.   
So just tried to hit greens, and when I had some good opportunities, I was able to make some putts.   
 Q.  You had 29 putts today.  It was a good, solid performance.  What's your mind-set coming into this week, given the fact that you are pretty well solidified to get into the BMW Championship next week?  
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, I mean, I'm not thinking too much about it.  Made a little putting adjustment in the final round last week and started to see a lot go in.  So that was kind of the one thing that I was maybe on edge about.   
But feeling good on the greens.  My ball-striking's been pretty solid.  Like the course, so feel pretty good.
