 Q.  What a super round of golf, 68, but just the number belies really the adventures you had out there today:  Eight birdies, only had five pars.  Talk me through the round.  What was going through your head as you were going up-and-down the scoreboard all day?  
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, my second nine, which was the front nine, yeah, I just kind of made a bad shot there on 1.  Kept making birdies after my bogeys which was a good thing.  Overall I'm pretty happy.  I was able to start off with a couple birdies today before I hit that tough 12, 13, 14 stretch.   
You know, overall, pretty pleased.   
 Q.  Now going into tomorrow, it looks like the forecast looks pretty dire.  Are you a good mudder?  
KYLE STANLEY: I'm from Washington, so I'm used to rain.  I haven't checked to see what it's going to be like but we'll be prepared.   
 Q.  What's going to be your game plan for Sunday and Monday?  Just a couple of shots off the lead.  Feeling pretty comfortable about this position?  
KYLE STANLEY: Yeah, more of the same, really.  Just need to save a few more shots.  The bogeys, some of them were just bad bogeys, bogeys with wedges and short irons in my hand.  Clean a little bit of that up, and other than that, just keep doing what I'm doing.
