  KATHIE SHEARER:   A great round today, 7‑under par.   You've had a nice year by your standards, New Zealand PGA, three wins in PG; have you been playing well coming up to this week?   
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Not at all really.   I had a lot of time off over winter.   Only played a couple of events.   Just the way the schedule worked out.   And spent a lot of time on Gold Coast actually doing a lot of practice over there.   
Form had been a bit rough but saw a few glimpses last week in China and just nice to carry on.  
KATHIE SHEARER:   Have you played this tournament very much, this golf course?   
MICHAEL HENDRY:   No, never played this golf course before.   First time around ON Tuesday.   Played pretty well.   Played well in the Pro‑Am yesterday, as well.   So hopefully I can keep it up.   
   
 Q.   After the last couple years, does that change your mind‑set‑‑  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Not at all, the complete opposite to be honest.   When you're playing bad and you're spending lots of money to get to events and not getting a lot of return on that investment sometimes, it does put a lot of pressure on you to play well.   
But you just keep working hard and hoping it turns the corner at some stage, and it has the last couple of weeks.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Not really.   I think probably just playing a bit more.   I spent so much time hitting balls on the driving range and only playing a couple of events over a three‑month period.   So you kind of lose that feel for the game and you don't have that match fitness, I suppose, is a way of putting it.   Maybe I just kind of got back into the rhythm of actually playing now and hitting a lot of good shots.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Well, I actually shot 65 in the Pro‑Am yesterday, as well.   I think around here, if you can hit your drives in the right place, you can give yourself lots of opportunities to hit it close with wedges.   And I hit my driver pretty well and wedged it well and putted it well.   
So all in all, just a really solid round of golf.   If you're going to play good golf, you're going to have a lot of opportunities around this golf course.   Luckily enough, I capitalized on them today.   
   
 Q.   With this first round‑‑ how do you go‑‑  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Yeah, it's a clichÃ©, but you take one shot at a time and give 100 per cent effort to each of those shorts.   Unfortunately no matter how hard you try, sometimes you're going to hit a bad shot, so you have to just cope with that and move on.   
Like I say, try your best on each and every shot, and hopefully combining a whole lot of good shots is going to equal a good score; and if you shoot good scores, you're going to be up on the board come the end of the week.   
   
 Q.   What is your schedule now?  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   I'm going to be playing every event for the remainder of the Australasian season and trips to Japan for Qualifying School.   It will be nice to stick around kind of home.   Spend a lot of time over here, so really looking forward to it, and hopefully I can finish the season up well.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   This year it was more about the dates clashing we events that I wanted to play in, and playing in Japan means I wouldn't have to move away from home at this stage.   I'm pretty happy living in New Zealand and it's quite a simple flight up to Japan.   You know, similar time zone and all that sort of thing.   
So at this stage, it felt like it was the right decision for me.   If I continue to do well and stay right at the top of the Order of Merit, I'll have really good opportunities at Q‑Schools next year all over the world.   So I'll take my opportunities for Europe and the U.S. probably next year.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Of course it does but one round out of four, 54 holes to go, a lot of golf, a lot of birdies and bogeys to be had yet.   Like I say, put 100 per cent effort into each shot and hopefully I'll keep hitting them good.   
   
 Q.   Is your coachon the golf ‑‑  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   No, he lives in Auckland.   His name is Craig Dixon.   He works with the Institute of Golf, but also coached Lydia Ko, I don't know whether you've heard of her, she's pretty decent.   So we've got a pretty tight‑knit unit in Albany.   He's a fantastic coach and I owe a lot to him.   I've been working with him for about four years and ever since I started working with him, it's been a good four years.   So hopefully we can continue to go forward in the game.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
MICHAEL HENDRY:   Yeah, I kind of did.   I think the longest I holed was probably the one on 18.   Yeah, I hit a lot of.  
   
 Q.   How long?   
MICHAEL HENDRY:   It was probably 25 feet.   So a lot of close birdie putts, hit a lot of wedges, finished pretty close.   Had a chip‑in as well on 16.   
KATHIE SHEARER:   Thank you very much for coming in.
