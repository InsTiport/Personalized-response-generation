 Q.  Just get some comments on your round, pretty rainy, pretty dreary today?  GREG OWEN: We were lucky in all fairness.  This morning was awful.  Looked out the window, and I'm like, I'm surprised that we're playing, and then saw the suspension for, what was it, 10, 20 minutes?  So they must have got it pretty bad and we were lucky.  As I said, the greens are just starting to get a few footprints on them, but other than that, the course has held up really well.   Q.  How bad was it on the front nine?  GREG OWEN: It was good.  We were moving at a nice pace.  The back nine we obviously caught up with the guys who started on the back nine and it started really slowing up, and that started to take its toll.  It started getting tiring out there.  But as I say, the golf course has stayed up pretty well, and I did a lot of damage on the front nine, which helped me just cruise through on the back nine.
