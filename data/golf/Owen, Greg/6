Q. What a strong finish for you; you birdied three of your last six holes, and you just stuffed it in tight at the 10th to begin your inward nine.
GREG OWEN: Yeah, it's been a good day.  It's been a good week.  I played really solid this week.  For having two weeks off and coming in, just working a little bit on some fundamentals with my coach, it's been a really good week.  I've played really well, and I've putted really well, as well, for me.
Q. I thought you had control of the golf ball.  You hit 15 of 18 greens in three of the four rounds this week.
GREG OWEN: Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that's it.  I put it in play.  My irons -- really comfortable with the irons.  The driver was a little sketchy at the start of the week, and it's come good today and yesterday.  But I played good.  Actually I hit two of the best shots I could at 18.  I cannot quite understand how it went over that hill, but it is what it is.  I can't ask for much more.  I played great.
Q. For a guy that's not fully exempt on TOUR, a top-five finish like that could really help you out and give you some confidence?
GREG OWEN: Yeah, playing next week in Vegas now, but all in all, I've been doing this a long time.  It's just nice to be able to feel like I can still play and keep up with all these young kids because most of them are half my age now.
