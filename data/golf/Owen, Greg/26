 Q. Okay, Greg. Good playing today. Just talk about your round a little bit.
 GREG OWEN: It was very early this morning, so first few holes were a little bit of a blur, but I made a sweet bogey on the first hole, which really got my focus going. Played the par-3s really well really, three 2s out there, which was nice.

 Q. Any long putts on there, so those holes?
 GREG OWEN: I think the longest would have been 12, 15 feet. Not had any bombs all year. Hit some good shots in, some close wedges and got away with a couple of poor drives, which really kept the momentum going, which is what this game's all about. 
 You know, just nice to get a decent round of golf in.

 Q. Okay. And sort of summarize your year. I mean obviously an important week for you.
 GREG OWEN: Oh, I need to win it. Yeah, very important. It's been a terrible year. I'm very disappointed. 
 You know, I know I can produce better golf than that, but just for some reason this year, I've worked hard, I've done what I can and it's just not happening. I'll play a round nicely and all of a sudden hit a bad shot and cost me making the cut. 
 And it's been a struggle. I've got no answers. I just gotta keep working. When we played today, I don't feel like I played by any stretch my best round of golf. Shooting 4-under on Magnolia is like, okay. I don't know how he does it. It's just a stupid game that we all love, but will never conquer.

 Q. Okay. But you're in position through two rounds. You got two more rounds to try to get it done, so good luck.
 GREG OWEN: Yeah. I'm going to do some work now, have a bit of a rest and go out and try and hit a few more fairways tomorrow, and hopefully sink some putts as well.

 Q. Okay. Thanks.
 GREG OWEN: All right. Thank you.
