Q.   You birdied your last hole to go to 8â€‘under.   Just some thoughts on your round today?
GREG OWEN:   Very good today.   I played really well today.   Tough conditions, and drove it in most of the fairways and just kept plugging away and took some chances.

Q.   How would you categorize 2012 so far?
GREG OWEN:   Okay.   I've made, what, now, four out of five cuts.   Finished ninth at Pebble.   It's getting back to where I used to play four or five years ago, and that feels nice. 
It's been a bit of wandering around in the wilderness for a couple of years, so it's nice to see play is back and it's nice to see a few putts drop in.

Q.   How about conditions out there?   Was it pretty windy all day?
GREG OWEN:   Yeah, no, it's been blowing the same all day, even at 6:00 this morning in the dark it was still howling, so it's a little tougher than yesterday, I thought, but you know, it's fair out there.   It's not like the balls are moving on the green or anything, so you just gotta play well and adapt.
