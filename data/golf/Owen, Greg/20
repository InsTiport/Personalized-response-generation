  GREG OWEN: For the last green, pretty good.   Missed a putt, very annoying on these greens.   They're not easy anyway.   But, you know, I'm -- I just have to -- I'd like to be a little further up on the leaderboard.   I got it to 25 at one stage, that was nice, also.   
It's tough out here.   I hit to it 20 feet on 16 and missed the green with my next shot.   You're on the green and you can't even keep it on it.   It's tough.   You got to put yourself in the right positions and just make some putts.  
   
 Q.   Assuming you have to put yourself in the right frame of mind as well.  
GREG OWEN:   It's pretty difficult but, you know, you can hit a decent shot and have nothing and it's just accepting it.   It's hard to accept it when it's such an important week.   It's not the kind of golf course I'd really wanted for this kind week but it is what it is.   It's 18 holes out there and go make as many birdies as you can.  
   
 Q.   Your final feeling, you've contended in many, many tournaments around the world.   Do you compare it against the pressure or the feelings that you have here at this one, considering your position to other times in your career?  
GREG OWEN:   You know, I've been worried about this all year long and it's not worth it.   It is what it is.   I'm trying -- if I wasn't trying, then, you know, fair enough.   I'm working hard.   I've had a decent career rear.   This is 18 years now.   
It's a long, long trek.   You know, you lose more times than you win.   I just going to accept whatever comes.   I'm fed up with worrying about it because what are you going to do?   There's worse things in life.
