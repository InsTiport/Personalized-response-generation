 Q.   1‑under par‑70, very steady round, 10 pars in a row to start your round off.   Talk about it a little bit.   
GREG OWEN:   Well, just played well.   Just hit fairways.   I think the fairways and greens were fair.   The greens are quick.   The flags are on some pretty severe slopes to putt around.   So it's just hitting good shots, taking what you get.   As you say, I think I two‑putted the first 10 greens, I can't even remember, and just played solid.   That's what you have to do around here.   It's tough.   It's probably the hardest setup I think I've ever played.  
   
 Q.   Well, you hit 16 greens, had 33 putts, so obviously you were dialed in at least on your approaches.   
GREG OWEN:   I putted well.   I'm happy with the way I putted.   I missed one from like five feet on 6, the par‑5.   Other than that, I putted really well.   I was happy with the way I putted.   If you just get on the wrong side‑‑ I hit a lot of good shots.   I hit a 4‑iron to like five feet and I'm just trying to dribble the putt down.   It's one of those courses where sometimes you have to just be patient and take what you can get and hopefully there will be a few easier putts come along.   
But I'm happy with the way I played obviously and happy with the way I putted.   Pace was good, and I holed out well.  
   
 Q.   Did you play here in the Open last year?  
GREG OWEN:   No.  
   
 Q.   A lot of players are saying conditions are much tougher this week.   
GREG OWEN:   Well, this is the hardest setup I think I've ever played.   It's not like the greens are rock hard.   There's still quite a bit of moisture in them.   But you have to hit fairways and you have to hit greens, and I did that well today.
