  GREG OWEN: I got off to a great start.  It's been great conditions.  A nice birdie on the 1st and then birdied the last, and in between it was just really, really solid.  Just one bunker, which you make bogey from and you accept, that's what's going to happen.  Other than that, just really happy and just played nice.   Q.  Not a bad start for an Open Championship at St. Andrews.  GREG OWEN: Not at all, no.  It's just nice and solid, but with the calmer conditions and softer greens, that's what you need to do because it's not going to get any easier than that.
