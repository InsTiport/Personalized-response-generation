Q. Who have you spoken to regarding the Open situation?
GREG OWEN:  My management group, Matchroom, spoke to someone at The R&A yesterday. I don't remember who We spend all our careers trying to earn World Ranking points to get into these Majors and the World Championships and to skip somebody because I pulled out of the Qualifier (in USA) to come and support my home Tour, which I've been asked to do, it's just disgraceful. They accepted my registration form but they say I can't go because I didn't go to the Qualifying.
Q. If you had opted for Final Qualifying this week, you would now be in the Open, even although that Qualifying hasn't taken place yet?
GREG OWEN:   Thanks!! It's just a typical R&A decision. We spoke to them. They said it's not written down that if you pull out of the Qualifiers, you pull out of the Open. It's a decision they made earlier this year. You explain that to me. I'm just trying to improve myself and go forward in my career and you get brick walls built up all over the place and it's just bureaucracy again. It says it nowhere and they've just come up with it.
Q. You can still get in through here?
GREG OWEN:  Yes, but that's not the point, is it? They are going on World Rankings. They want the best players there, and all of a sudden they skip three guys and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I've got to play well. It's a strong field and there are a lot of guys want that one spot. You are relying on one week but I've been working my whole career for world ranking points and to miss out is ridiculous. You either get the best world ranked player or you don't. The thing I'm a little disappointed about is that I pulled out of the (U.S.) Qualifier to represent The European Tour, who have not sway in this at all. I understand that The R&A is a separate body but I just wish something could have been done about it.
Q. If you had hit one shot in that Qualifier and then pulled out, you would now be in?
GREG OWEN:  Exactly. That's the stupid thing about it. They don't ask you to complete the two rounds. They just ask you to tee it up. They would have been upset if I'd done that as well. You just can't please them.
Q. What about the second hole?
GREG OWEN:  That was my 11th. I holed nothing all day, played really  solid. The only bogey I've had in two rounds is a 3-putt from 15 feet. I was struggling a little on the greens. I holed a nine iron in the Pro-Am, my first hole Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ the sixth. Today I hit an 8-iron from 153 yards and straight in on the fly. Made a mess of the hole. It's always nice to do something like that.
Q.  You made it to Lytham on the strength of doing well here.

GREG OWEN.  I finished 11th here and got in. Who knows? Still two rounds to go.
