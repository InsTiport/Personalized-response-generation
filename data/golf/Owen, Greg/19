Q.   Greg Owen at the 18th green.   Sort of just tell me a little bit about your round.
GREG OWEN:   Just front nine was great.   I hit the ball really solid, gave myself a couple of chances.   Birdied the par‑5s, got me going.   Missed a couple of short putts for birdies, but kept my head and rolled a nice putt in on nine and then Back 9 the wind picked up and started playing a bit tough, but just got a little‑‑ you know, just played solid, hit the greens and then made a putt on the par‑5 from about 12 feet, or 15.   And then rolled a nice one on 17.   So just a lot of good momentum.   No bogeys and just kept it in play.

Q.   You mentioned the course a little bit.   But just tell me thoughts on the course this year.   How are you feeling?
GREG OWEN:   Course is great.   You know, it's in good shape.   It's soft, obviously with the showers we keep having.
You just gotta keep it in play.   You know, there's a lot of hazards there if you're wide off the tee.   If you drive the ball well, you're going to have chances, and obviously you have to make the putts.

Q.   Just a last question.   How are you liking Puerto Rico so far?
GREG OWEN:   It's great without the rain.   It's a nice place to come, and we're having a lot of fun, obviously.
