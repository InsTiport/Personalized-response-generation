Q. Greg, bogey-free for one round now.  Now bogey-free through 36 holes.  Really nice.GREG OWEN: Very happy.  Driving the ball well and just taking my time, taking my chances when I get them and just being very patient.Q. You and I spoke in Memphis, were the runner up.  You felted like you turned the corner there.  More of the same since then for the consistent play or a few changes to the game?GREG OWEN: No, exactly the same.  I'm holing out well which is keeping the momentum going, 3, 4-footers, just throughout my career I struggled with as I made them a lot more solidly.  I'm holing out. Anytime I get in trouble I'm a little bit more comfortable thinking par and I'm taking chances.  I've not holed many putts.  I made a real nice one on my 17th hole today.  Other than that I think ten feet is all I made.  I'm waiting to hit it close and taking them and not making any silly mistakes.Q. 29 greens in regulation through two rounds.  Has there been much change in the course from yesterday afternoon to what you saw this morning?GREG OWEN: No, not really.  I still -- it's still pretty wet out there, just with the moisture with the humidity and everything.  We're playing the ball down so occasionally you get a little bit of dirt on the ball. It's not really affected it today, I don't think.  The greens were a lot smoother this morning than they were yesterday afternoon.  I expect they'll be a little bumpy this afternoon.  With so much moisture in the ground it's hard to get them as smooth as they want
