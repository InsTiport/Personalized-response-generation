 Q. Good playing out there. A 5 under 57 today. Talk about your round a little bit. 
 GREG OWEN: Started off well. Hit some good shots. Obviously, the wind is a factor now. Made a couple of putts, and made a 2 under nice and comfortable. Then three-putted 16, and got two horrific lies on two different bunkers on 18 so made bogey there. 
 And I was lucky enough to hole the bunker shot on 1, and it just kicked out. And I played nice and solid and holed a couple of 12 footers to finish off.

 Q. The wind is a factor on any course you play, but this course here was really swirling probably toward the middle of your round. How much of a factor did the wind play? 
 GREG OWEN: Well, it was blowing. I don't know about swirling. It was pretty consistent everywhere we played. There were a few gusts, but it's obviously tough. We played in wind every week this year. It seems pretty monotonous now. It's just about getting your grips about you. 
 You've got to put your ball on the fairway here, and try to get it close to these flags, obviously. With the slopy greens it's not that easy, but I managed to to do pretty well today.

 Q. You're playing well. You played well last week. How do you feel overall about your game? 
 GREG OWEN: I'm hitting a lot of good shots so I'm feeling a lot better. I'm working hard on my putter, and obviously that's paying off as well. 
 It's been a tough start of the year for me. I've not done very well. I've not felt very healthy. And it's nice to start feeling like I'm playing like my usual self. So hopefully I can just keep it going and get a good result.
