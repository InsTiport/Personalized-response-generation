 Q.  Greg, 14 points today.  You hit 13 of 14 fairways, 14 of 18 greens, so pretty solid ball-striking day.  Just get some comments.  
GREG OWEN: Yeah, the only dropped shots I've had really have been three-putts because it's difficult with us being on the side of a mountain, it's very deceiving with your eyes whether you're uphill, downhill.  The speeds are very difficult to judge.   
Played nicely, feeling comfortable, so holed some nice putts today.  It's been a long time since that's happened.   
 Q.  You're making your fifth start at this tournament.  Not a lot of success in your first three, but you finished 20th last year.  Anything that you're finding here at Montreux?  
GREG OWEN: Just reading the greens better.  I mean, I'm not finding them easy, but I'm actually doing a better job and hitting my lines.  I know I holed a chip on my 36-hole last year to make the cut for an eagle, so that gave me some good vibes.  But just feeling comfortable.  I'm not putting any pressure on myself now.  I'm just trying to play well and see what happens.   
 Q.  Speaking of cuts, you missed the last three on TOUR, so I know you're happy to be back at the weekend.  Talk a little bit about your goals for the week.  
GREG OWEN: I'm with the family, so my goal is to enjoy it.  We're going to Colorado next week and then we're going to go to Steamboat and have a nice relaxing week.  I'm just here to try and relax and enjoy it.  It's been tough this year.  It's been hard.  I've felt like I've played pretty good but got nothing out of it.  So you grind and you grind with no results.  So to have the family out here during school vacation is nice.  It's relaxing.  You don't think quite so much of your golf and yourself.  I think it's probably taken a little off me.  I'm enjoying it.  It's good.
