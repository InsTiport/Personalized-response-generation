 Q.  Best round of the week so far; what was kind of working today for you?  
JIARUI JIN: My putting was really good today, and I made a lot of birdies.  And my driver was also good.  I made a lot of fairways today, which is really important for this course.  And irons was also okay; that's why I played really good.   
 Q.  How are you liking the course?  
JIARUI JIN: I mean, this course is really beautiful, and it's also challenging, and I think the rough is really hard for us.  It's really long, and we have to hit our drivers straight to make a good course.  So yeah, the course is great.   
 Q.  What's your experience in match play before?  Do you like it?  
JIARUI JIN: I've played Holo (ph.) And U.S. Girls.  I'm not really good at match play because I'm not really emotional, and I'm kind of like quiet.  So I think match play is not like -- I don't really have too much experience on it, but I will try hard tomorrow.   
 Q.  It looks like you might be co-medalist.  Does that kind of give you some confidence going into match play?  
JIARUI JIN: Yeah, that gives me a lot of confidence.   
 Q.  Obviously Angelina just won at the Girls' Junior.  There's a lot of Chinese players playing well.  What do you think that's about?  
JIARUI JIN: Yeah, me and Angelina are also really good friends, and we're all from China.  It makes me really happy to see so many Chinese people are playing well.  Yeah, it's great, and I will try my best to do well.
