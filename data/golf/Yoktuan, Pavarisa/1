 Q.  Tell me about today's round out there.  
PAVARISA YOKTUAN: I played pretty good.  Yeah, like everything was all good.  I hit my irons so good, so I had like 16 regular on, and then I made five of them, yeah, so bogey-free today.  It's perfect, yeah.   
 Q.  What do you think about the scores so far?  What are the things you need to do to score well?  
PAVARISA YOKTUAN: This course, the course is in good shape.  I mean, it's in perfect shape, so like you just need to keep your tee shot in the fairway.  That's all you need, because the green is soft.  After the rain yesterday, the greens are very soft, so you can put the ball like right next to the hole.  You have to like work on the iron shot.  That's all you need.   
 Q.  And what's it like playing in a new event?  Do you feel like everyone has a chance since no one has played out here before?  
PAVARISA YOKTUAN: Yeah, I think everyone has a chance.  You know, like the arrangements, it's very good.  The transportation, the golf course, the hotel, I think everything is perfect.  Yeah, it's new for everyone, so I think everyone has a chance.
