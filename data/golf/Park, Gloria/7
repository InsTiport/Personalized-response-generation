MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Gloria Park to the interview room, defending champion.  If you want to just talk about the win last year and good memories from the win last year.
GLORIA PARK: Well, first of all, last year, I didn't want to come to this tournament.  I was tired of playing a lot of tournaments.  Then I just decided to play, and then I ended up winning, which is so great.  And since then playing this tournament is one of my favorites.  I'm tired still, but I really like to be here and the crowd, the people, are very nice.  I have a couple friends here, which is good.  I get to relax and everything so far is great.
MODERATOR:  Questions?
Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: That's exactly what I'm thinking.  First of all, last year, since I won this tournament, since then I played pretty good at the end of the year, and this year earlier was okay, and then I changed my caddy, and since then, I was a little bit  -- I lost my confidence, I think, and then from there, I lost myself.  My game has improved since last year, but my game is not really together, and I had my new coach from last year, and then so, I mean, everything I think needs to be really together, but first of all, I need to have a little more confidence.  I feel because I won last year, I feel better or maybe more confident, and hopefully I'll play a little better this week and keep going on.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: Well, I  -- last year, I think my iron was very good.  I made a couple putts.  I was doing something yesterday in the morning, and I'm going to try it out there, but we'll see. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: Well,  -- it was very interesting things  -- they were doing kind of interesting research for golf, and I had been testing those for my eyes before.  My eyes is different, my left and right, and I was doing some tests.  It is kind of new technology.  They wanted me to do some testing yesterday, but it takes couple hours.  They were asking me, can you do it tomorrow.  Next time, I'm going to be here like at the end of the season maybe, and I want to try to see how the results are.  I tried a couple things about the ears and  -- I had experience of when I play in really, really cold weather, when you put the ear  -- yeah, when you cover the ear, it feels weird to me because of the balance.  I felt like there was something  -- I would like to hear more about it when I come back later.  It was really interesting.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: Well, technology with the golf club makes it definitely different.  There is  -- a couple years ago, there is a couple of different types of golf playing.  There is long hitters that help with the long game; and short hitters that help with the short game.  Right now, the golf ball and the club make a little difference, and also right now I think LPGA, they really upgraded it, I think, and they do a lot of exercises.  Everything comes together, and I think we are doing more like the men's tour, more competitive, and that's how we really improved, and everyone is playing really good right now.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: Well, at some point it's really good for the LPGA; like ladies can do it good.  Especially Annika, I think she wanted to know how good she is for herself.  At some point, maybe myself I would be afraid to try with the men and stuff.  Still, I'm thinking men and women are different.  It's very hard to say.  I don't really want to say about what  -- she had a different opinion about things, what she's doing, and I've got a different one as well.  It should be good, yeah.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
GLORIA PARK: Well, still, everybody still thinks about what they're doing.  I don't know. 
MODERATOR:  Thank you.
