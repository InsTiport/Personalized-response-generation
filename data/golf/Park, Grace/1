 Q. Talk about your day.
 GRACE PARK: I started out really well today. I think I birdied the first four of the six holes, and made some big par putts to save par to keep myself at 4-under. My putting obviously was really good, and I stayed very consistent. 
 Nothing fantastic, but it was kind of boring golf. I hit a lot of fairways, lot of greens, lot of good putts. 

 Q. How have you been feeling healthwise. I know you had issues with your back. How have you been feeling lately? 
 GRACE PARK: It's been great, so I honestly have no excuses. In the past that was my excuse and that was the truth. But right now I'm as healthy as I've been in ten years, and yeah, knock on wood.

 Q. I was going to say how nice is it to go out there and have that kind of a day where you're so consistent and to be able to find that? 
 GRACE PARK: Yeah, it's like I called it boring golf. I play Army golf. I go left and right, and I do some miraculous saves, but today, I mean, sometimes this is what it takes. I mean, a lot of the times. And I don't mind boring golf. 
 If I can just continue it and keep it up through the weekend, I'll be very happy.

 Q. I know you saw the ruling on the last hole and I know you had addressed the ball but you hadn't put the club down. Can you just explain what happened there? 
 GRACE PARK: Yeah, I just had a little foot putt left to finish out. I was going into set up, and my ball started because of the wind I think it didn't rest as well and started to move, so I backed off. 
 But I couldn't honestly remember if I had grounded it or I going into it. But, I wasn't, so yeah. 

 Q. Yeah, you hadn't grounded it. I was watching it.
