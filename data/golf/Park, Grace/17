PAUL ROVNAK:  Grace, thanks for coming and joining us, 6 under, you had a great finish to the dare with birdieing three of the last four holes.  Why don't you tell us about your day, and we'll go from there.
GRACE PARK:   First of all, I'd like to say I'm very, very pleased with today's 66 because leading up to this week, I started very slowly, shooting around even, 1 over, 2 over my first round.  So I had to push myself so hard to shoot lower scores in the second, third and fourth round to finish.  I really wanted to start off good, and fortunately, I was able to do that today.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Talk about winning Nabisco and then going to L.A. and the week off.  Did you have to recharge the batteries at all after the big win, the major?
GRACE PARK:   Well, no.  So many people have been asking me if anything has changed or I felt tired or sick or whatever.  I didn't feel any different, and because L.A. was a three day event, I was able to take a good, day, day and a half off, and I felt fine.  Then nothing's changed, nothing different, just a normal week off.  I enjoyed it and I came off and then had another week off.
Q.  How is the course playing?
GRACE PARK:   Toughened it up from the first day.  I wanted to stay focused and start off with birdies in the first few holes, and I was able to do that, birdieing the first hole.  Just gave myself very many good opportunities to make birdie, and then it just came and came and came and it was just really pleasant out there today.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   I had to because I wanted to get in the Top 5, Top 10, whatever, and unfortunately the past two tournaments were three day events and didn't have a very good first round or second round, and I didn't get that extra 18 holes to recover.  So, you know, during my last week off, I worked with my teacher, Peter Kostis, and just talked to him and just realized that I had to deal with the first round as if it was like the final round.  And I did that, but just in my mind, I wanted to feel like I was in contention.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   I'm just more mature, I think, more experienced.  I worked hard.  I started working really, really hard maybe two, two and a half years ago, but now finally the work is paying off.  I had a great year last year, a big jump from the year before, and the year before that.  And just with a little more confidence year by year and a little more work into it.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   Everything.  As my stroke improved, my mental side improved, as well.  I don't get too hard on myself more, even though I do, but I don't, I don't know, you know what I mean.  I get over it quick but I have to let it out.      you don't want to know.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   It was one of the best ball striking days yet this year.  I missed a couple of fairways, but most of the times I hit it perfectly where I wanted to.  My second shots, I was, you know, just attacking the pin all day.  Felt like I left a lot of birdies out there, but then with greens getting firmer as the day went and the wind picking up on and off, I played very, very good, clean.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   I'm having a ton of fun.  My caddie, Dave, is great.  We lot along great.  People always come up to me and tell me that I'm one of the only ones that look like I'm having fun.  That's what I'm trying to do, enjoy what I do.
Q.  How do you feel about the course?
GRACE PARK:   It's pretty straightforward.  There are a few holes that you have to be careful off the tee.  Maybe a couple around the greens, but when you're swinging well and have that confidence, you don't worry.  You just attack it.  You just stick with the plan and you hit the shot you need to and it works out.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   18 is probably one of the easiest holes because it's so short, but, to me, like today, I went in the bunker and I almost had to hit a 3 wood off the tee because the wind was helping and with my length, I was going to have very narrow, small spot landing area in the fairway.

That hole has always been, you know, one of the easiest holes.  It feels like you've made a bogey or double if you par it.  They could mark on the tee behind like 20, 30 yards back.  I hope they use it.
Q.  Inaudible?
GRACE PARK:   Physical work, and through that, I was able to get tougher mentally, as well.
