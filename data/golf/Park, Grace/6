Q.  Talk a little about your match.
GRACE PARK:  Started off slow, bogeyed the first hole, went 1 down and then birdied one of the holes and had a shot to tie and then went birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.  She bogeyed and I had a little one, so I was 2 up after four holes.
Q.  The second nine did you start playing better?
GRACE PARK:  I was struggling and missed a couple of short shots but I birdied two of the par 5s but on the back side.

I made bogey on 10 and she made par.  Then birdied 11 and then after that really didn't up and down at all on 16 and 17.  I didn't make any bogeys, I had 16 pars and two birdies.  I shot 2 under, so it was a very tough round.
