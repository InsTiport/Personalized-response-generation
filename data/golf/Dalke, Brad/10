Q. Brad, phenomenal start today.  What got you going today?
BRAD DALKE: I've been playing well lately.  Last few matches I've been playing, just had a couple bogey streaks that kind of killed me and got the other guys back in the match.
I've gotten off to nice starts in all my matches and this one was no different.  Got off to hitting the ball well, hitting it close and making putts.  It was nice I kind of had that lead the whole time.
But we both, I think David probably shot 3-under on his own ball and I think I shot five or six.  We both played really well.  It's just a great match from the start.
Q. What do you look forward to going to the semis?
BRAD DALKE: Just battling again.  It's been a battle for these first four matches.  It's the toughest tournament out there for amateur, and to be able to go out there and play as well as I have so far, I'm just excited for the opportunity that God has given me.  It will be fun.
Q. You had your brother on the bag for the first couple matches and now you have your teammate on bag.  How did that come about?
BRAD DALKE: My brother, he knew he had to go to a wedding yesterday afternoon.  He knew he had to go.  If I made it that far, we just had to figure it out.  So he had to leave.  And Grant's here.
Grant, I love him.  He's my teammate and we have a good relationship, and it's nice to have him on the bag.  My brother's great, too.  Kind of weird switching but both of them have been great.
