 Q.  Opening 67, talk a little bit about your round and how you felt with the outcome.  
BRAD DALKE: Yeah, I just hit it really solid all day, didn't get myself in too bad of spots.  Started on 9, kind of hit a horrible drive on the first hole, but after that I hit lots of fairways, lots of greens, was able to get a lot of putts to go in on my front, on the back nine.   
On the other side I kept hitting it pretty well but just couldn't get a few putts to go in.  But, no, just a really solid round, didn't get myself in bad spots and made a few putts when I needed to.   
 Q.  I think you had four birdies on your front nine?  
BRAD DALKE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Were there any, anything that sticks out?  Any long putts that you made?  
BRAD DALKE: I guess 18, first three birdies I made were all within 10 feet or -- I 2-putted 17 or birdie and 18 I made about a 25, 30-footer to get to 4-under and that was good to get, that's a tough hole.  So, yeah, I guess it was all pretty easy birdies, other than 18, that was a nice putt.   
 Q.  So you're no stranger to these events, obviously you've been here before and runner-up in 2016.  Do you think some of that is helping with your confidence here being comfortable?  
BRAD DALKE: Yeah, I mean, I love the USGA events, I love it when the course is tough and you have to think your way around it and try to get the ball in the right spots.  These courses definitely, both of these courses you have to think your way around them and if you do get yourself in a bad spot it can take a few shots to get in.  So I love the U.S. Amateur, just feels like a U.S. Open out here ands feels like a championship and, yeah, I luckily started hitting the ball pretty well here in the last three or four days and got some confidence in the practice rounds and, yeah, it's, I hit it pretty well, so.
