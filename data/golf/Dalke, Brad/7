 Q.  It just looked like after the morning round you just didn't quite have it; you didn't drive it well enough?  
BRAD DALKE: Yeah, my driver got a little away from me that second round.  Didn't help that Curtis played really well on especially the front nine.  But yeah, just didn't -- I played solid this morning considering it's a little windy out here and stuff, but this afternoon just didn't quite have it.   
 Q.  What was different?  
BRAD DALKE: I just didn't ever feel comfortable really until really I had a couple good swings starting on kind of 11 maybe, 11 and 12, then at that point I was just too far down where I was trying my hardest, but just comeback wasn't very likely.  I just wasn't as comfortable out there.   
 Q.  You could have thrown in the towel but you showed a lot of guts coming back at 10 and 11, hitting some good shots, giving it yourself.  
BRAD DALKE: Yeah, that's all you can do.  You know, I try my best.  Whatever happens happens.  It's God's plan, and I tried my best out there the whole time.  Even when I was hitting it all over the place, I was trying my best.  When I was starting to play good there at the end, I was trying my best.  Whatever happens happens.  Today just wasn't my day, but Curtis is a great winner, and he definitely deserves it.   
 Q.  A lot of things go along with being a finalist in the U.S. Amateur.  Was everything what you thought it would be?  
BRAD DALKE: It was awesome.  All the fans out here were great.  It was a great week.  I wish it could have ended a little better, obviously, but what a great week.  It was awesome out here at Oakland Hills.
