 Q. Talk about the course. Just how it played today?
 DAN HORNIG: Actually, considering all the rain we had, it wasn't too bad. It played like our practice round days I think. Greens were perfect. So it's a great golf course. It's a great layout. It drains awfully well, compared to what we had the last few days. It was a good, fair course. It was long, tough, but fair. 

 Q. Long day, right?
 DAN HORNIG: Yeah.

 Q. Just give us an overview of your day. 
 DAN HORNIG: It was kind of up-and-down. Got over par, got back to even par, then got back over and I made a good birdie on 17 and parred 18. To shoot 3-over, unfortunately, but I made some good birdies on some really tough holes. I bogeyed a few too many other holes.
