  Q. Obviously a very productive back nine here, how did you find it here today?
 JOACHIM B. HANSEN:   Lovely out there.  I mean, got a bit of rain at the start, middle of the round.  A bit of wind, but at the end, it's nice and calm and no rain.  It's beautiful.
 Q. How much does the rain affect?  There's the SubAir, but I can't imagine the course is changing too much?
 JOACHIM B. HANSEN:   No, we didn't get a lot of rain.  I mean, I only put the umbrella up.  I didn't put rain gear on.  But it's nice it stopped.
 Q. Obviously the rough here is not as penal as previous weeks but with the weather doesn't make it any easier.  How is your 7-wood working?
 JOACHIM B. HANSEN:   Lovely.  Hit it into a second shot here on 18.  Just a bit long but decent chip.  Loving it.
 Q. Not a single bogey on the card today and you're just one of three guys that managed that today.  Looking into tomorrow, the top guys are three shots clear.  What do you need to do?
 JOACHIM B. HANSEN:   Do the same.  Stick to my game plan and keep my head down and see where it goes.
 Q. You tried to get on to The European Tour five or six  years through Q-School.  Since coming through The Challenge Tour a few years ago, you look more settled.  Are you feeling different?
 JOACHIM B. HANSEN:   I'm hitting the ball better.  Family is great at home and everything is in a good place.
