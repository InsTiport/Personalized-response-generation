Q. Your thoughts on that round?
TYRELL HATTON: I'm really happy to win against Westie.  Obviously it was going to be a tough match.  I felt like I played pretty solid for most of the way.  Delighted to win the group and get through to the weekend.
Q. Were you keeping an eye on the scoreboards as you were going around?
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, we had a little look every now and then, but obviously our main objective is to try and win our match, which thankfully we managed to do.  And then I guess we were fortunate the other result went the way we needed it to, and meant we could advance without having to go into a playoff.
Q. You knew with a victory you weren't going to a playoff.  So it wasn't going to be on your mind the whole way through?
TYRELL HATTON: No, it was in my hands today with the outcome what was going to happen.  So I did my job, I played pretty well and managed to get the win.  And like I said, yeah, it all fell into place.
Q. Does that change your mentality when you know it's in your hands?
TYRELL HATTON: Not really.  I mean, you've still just got to go out and try to play your best and hopefully win your match.  You can't control, obviously, the other matches.  You only do your bit and thankfully I managed to do that.
