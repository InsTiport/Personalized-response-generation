 Q.  You got your work done quickly out here.  It's always good to conserve energy, you must have a lot of confidence in the game right now after a 4 and 3 win over Rafa?  
TYRELL HATTON: Very happy with that performance today.  Always going to be a really tough match against Rafa.  He's a fantastic player.  He has a very good match play record.  He beat me here a couple of years ago, so it was nice to get a little bit of revenge today.   
I'm happy with how I played.  I've been struggling a bit recently with confidence and stuff.  I feel like I'm slowly getting my swing back.  I hit a couple of poor shots today, which was easy to do because the wind was tricky, but I had a lot of good golf shots and take some confidence for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You have an option of playing in, just to play these holes to get used to them because your match is over.  Will you play in or are you going to call it a day?  
TYRELL HATTON: I'm definitely going to call it a day.  Head back home.   
 Q.  With a smile of exhaustion on your face?  
TYRELL HATTON: I'll get back home, probably have a beer, and chill out for the rest of the evening.
