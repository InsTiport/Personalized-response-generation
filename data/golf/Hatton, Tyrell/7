 Q.  Yesterday you were 3-under par through 13 holes and let it slip to go to level par, and today you were 3-under early on and didn't let it slip.  Pleased with yourself?  
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, it was a tough day.  I was determined to get the shots back I dropped yesterday, it's obviously a good start and just a little quiet spell with the putter just not holing the putts, and I had a good finish.   
 Q.  One of the highlights of the finish was a chip-in on 17 and looked like it almost went in the water on the second and then making birdie.  Tell us about that.  
TYRELL HATTON: I thought I hit it in the water on the second shot and I was pleasantly surprised when I was 20 yards short of the green.  Just hit a lovely chip, didn't see it drop.   
 Q.  Very few good scores this afternoon, it's obviously a bit miserable, but give us a sense how difficult it is out there.  
TYRELL HATTON: Yeah, definitely feel like our side kind of got the tough side of the draw.  But yeah, it's quite windy and the rain is starting to come down now.  I'm very pleased with a 68, and looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  This is your third season on Tour, 36 and 35 in The Race to Dubai up to now.  What targets have you set yourself this year?  
TYRELL HATTON: My main goal is try and get my first win, and hopefully keep playing well and get myself into positions.  That's my main goal really is try and get my first win.
