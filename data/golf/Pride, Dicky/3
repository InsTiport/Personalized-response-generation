 Q. Just a quick comment:   Great round.   24.   At least temporarily second place.     
DICKY PRIDE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q. Gotta be feeling good about the day.     
DICKY PRIDE:   Yeah, I played solid.   And, yeah, a little up and down.   I had like a two-foot putt on 1 that is sitting in a hole that I hit the putt I wanted that jumped about four inches left and missed.   And I'm really thrilled that I just responded and said:   You know, that's going to happen to everybody and there's nothing you can do about it, so let's just go play.   
And I made some birdies on this side.   I was really happy to make eagle on 18, obviously, but I played the par 5s horrendously.   Actually got a birdie and a eagle today.   
   
 Q. What did you hit on 18 here?   
DICKY PRIDE:   I hit a 2 Rescue, 2-iron hybrid Rescue TaylorMade.   
   
 Q. Is wind a factor at all today?   
DICKY PRIDE:   Absolutely.   I've never seen it shift so much.   Thursday's the worst I've ever seen.   You could stand in one place and your shot will change completely.   And it started getting a little bit more towards the end and it's shifting.   So it's difficult to get the right wind and to commit to your shot.
