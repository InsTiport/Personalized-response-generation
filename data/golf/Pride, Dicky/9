Q.   Talk a little about today's round. 
DICKY PRIDE:   I played really good on the back side.   Front side was a little up‑and‑down.   I didn't quite hit it as good.   I got real lucky on 2.   Off the tee‑‑ it kicked back in and was able to get it out of the rough and I made like a 30‑footer for par, it was ridiculous.   But I took it.   So that was the big break. 
And yeah, I just played really solid.   Really only made a couple of bad shots.   I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in and hit a lot of putts that did go in, so hopefully I can keep doing that. 

Q.   On 18, was it dark enough to stop?
DICKY PRIDE:   No, it wasn't dark enough.   I had a 45‑footer or whatever it was for eagle and I didn't even have my caddie check the pin. 
So yeah, I could see it fine.   Now, where I hit the putt, it didn't look like I could see it, but that's beside the point.   That's my excuse.   I couldn't see the pin. 

Q.   The comeback was good.
DICKY PRIDE:   I did make the comeback.   Like I said, I hit it so far by the first putt, I could see it, it was breaking left and went the other side of the hole and started coming back to the right so I knew when I got to the other side of the hole, it was coming left and I played it just outside the right edge and it went in. 

Q.   Are you surprised or amazed at the depth or talent out here, seems like a new name on the leaderboard every week, whether it's Brian Harman shooting 61‑‑
DICKY PRIDE:   Take him back out ask let him play 16, 17.   What happened with that kid?   Geez. 
I mean, no, to answer your question‑‑ it's just not my forte.   But just a bunch of good players.   I've been playing some Nationwide the past couple years and these kids know how to play.   They come out of college knowing how to play.   And it doesn't surprise me anymore.
