Q.   Talk about the finish. 
DICKY PRIDE:   Yeah, I was very pleased with the finish.   I had to get my course record back.   In '01 I had the course record for a day and then Verplank and Morland beat me the next day, so to tie them, to go back and get it, I'm pretty happy about that.   And I was thinking about it on 18, too, which is an idiotic thing to do, but I made the putt anyway.

Q.   Talk about the conditions a little bit.   They were pretty soft out there. 
DICKY PRIDE:   It was definitely soft out there, and we played it up.   We needed to.   It was a good call.   I can't believe how well the weather has worked out.   It's just‑‑ the golf course is there.   We were first off, so the greens were perfect, and I got off to a good start because of it.
