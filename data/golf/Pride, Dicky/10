 Q.   This all began last weekend, you shot 66â€‘68 on the weekend, a little momentum you bring into the weekend?   
DICKY PRIDE:   Brought a lot of momentum.   Actually started on the Nationwide, I finished tied for 20th.   Played a practice round with my good friend, Glen Day and he's one of the best putters I ever met and he took a look, and I rolled it really good since then.   Like most things in golf, I had my setup messed up.   But got the putter back on plane.   
   
 Q.   Just one bogey on your next to last hole.   Got to hit the fairways, but the wind is down here, you can go get this course and you did a pretty good job.   
DICKY PRIDE:   Yeah, almost no wind, so yeah, I played solid today.   Had the one bogey, but that's going to happen.   Got to hit better shots than that, and I didn't hit a good shot.
