 Q. You missed a lot more short putts than you're accustomed to?
 J.R. ROTH: I put myself in position to have to make some of these short putts, like the first hole. And it was a very disappointing round. 
 I didn't play as well as I did yesterday and didn't get any breaks in terms of like the shot maybe on No. 6 going up the hill there. I really hoisted that up in the air there and it still went on the back shaft. I was hoping I'd get lucky and use the hill there and keep it on level with the pin. 
 But when you don't make any birdies it's hard to right the ship, you know? So after a while it was like I've got to get started here somewhere, and maybe I can shoot 72 or 73. But it just wasn't going to happen. 

 Q. Your drive on 14, where it looks perfect and gets a bad kick and all of a sudden you're in the right rough. Seemed like one of those days nothing was going to work for you?
 J.R. ROTH: Yeah, I tried to stay aggressive off the tee. I just kind of refused to give in in terms of the yardage and probably a couple of choices there where maybe I could have hit 3-wood. But I haven't been hitting that club very straight and so my philosophy is to hit the longest, straightest club in the bag. And right now it's still not the driver.
