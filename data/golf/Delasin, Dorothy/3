MODERATOR:  Dorothy, congratulations on your second straight 69.  You've played every round under par.  Second place at 7 under.  You'll be in the hunt tomorrow.  Just talk a little about that.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I just played pretty solid today.  You know, I was trying to give myself a lot of opportunities, and, you know, making some putts.  But today, you know, every time I had an opportunity, I had a really good look    run at it.  I also made a lot of par saves, so that was good.
MODERATOR:  We'll go over your scorecard.  You had the birdie on 4.  Do you remember what you hit and how far the putt was?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  (Laughter) I'm sorry.  1, 2, 3    oh, 4.  I had 102, I think, to the pin.  And I went over, so I chipped it in.
MODERATOR:  You chipped in?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yeah.
MODERATOR:  From how far?  Over the green?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Like 15.
MODERATOR:  15 feet?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Um hmm.
MODERATOR:  And just use a sand wedge for that?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yes.
MODERATOR:  And you had a birdie on 8?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  8, I had 90 yards to the    no, 88 yards to the hole.  And I hit my sand wedge.  54 degree wedge.  Knocked it to like 7 feet and made the putt.
MODERATOR:  And you backed it up with a birdie on 9?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  9 was about 162 yards to the pin.  I hit an 8 iron to about 12 feet and made the putt.
Q.  And bogey on 10?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  10 I went over the green.
MODERATOR:  What did you go over with?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I hit a choke 8 iron over the green.  And I missed 10 footer for par.  So I chipped from where I was.
MODERATOR:  So you chipped to 10 feet?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yes.
MODERATOR:  And missed a 10 footer?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yes.
MODERATOR:  And then birdied 11, the par 3.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yes.  It was 165, I think, to the pin.  And I hit an 8 iron to about 15 feet, I made the putt.
MODERATOR:  We'll take questions.
Q.  Could you just talk about the overall conditions out there, the wind and how difficult the course is playing?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Well, the greens are getting harder because of the wind, it's drying it out.  But, I mean, wind plays a big factor on how you're going to play this golf course because some holes some will play really tough and some will play really easy.

For instance, No. 5 was against the wind.  And you hit like a 5 iron up to the hole.  You know, I guess it depends on the wind.  Because one day it was downwind and I hit wedge.  So it's a big gap.  I mean, just mainly, you know, if Mother Nature is going to be nice, you're going to see some low scores; if she's going to howl, then you're going to see a lot of high scores.
Q.  With the changing of the winds and the environment, what can you take from each day and learn from each day, take that to the next round and going into tomorrow?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  You just take notes saying, okay, well, it's against the wind, I hit a 5 iron, should be similar.  I mean, it's pretty tough judging the wind here because it throws a lot.  I don't know how many times I threw grass in the air just to check before I hit the shot.  But, I mean, the wind here, it can fool you.
Q.  Would you rather be with Janice Moodie, assuming she's still in the lead, or would you rather be in front of her tomorrow so you can try to put some pressure on her by making birdies or putting some heat on her?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  No, it doesn't really matter.  I just go out there and play my own game.  I can't    I won't worry about her, because I can only control what I do.  I'm just going to go out and play my game and see what happens.
MODERATOR:  Any more questions for Dorothy?  Thank you, Dorothy.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Okay.
