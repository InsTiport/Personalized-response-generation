PAM WARNER:  Dorothy, thanks for coming in and joining us today.  Nice round.  You started out pretty strong and then you were at I think 10 under at one point.  Finished at 6 under.  Currently tied for second.  Do you just want to talk about your day.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Sure.  Just played some solid golf.  Just hit a few bad swings and then just tried to finish it, kind of just finish strong.
PAM WARNER:  Can we go over your scorecard.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yeah.
PAM WARNER:  Let's starts on the back.  Birdie on 11.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  11?  I hit a pitching wedge, it was 130 and I knocked it to about seven feet and made the birdie putt.
PAM WARNER:  Bogey on 13.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  13, I hit a 4 iron into the green.  I think I left it out a little on the right.  And I chipped and 2 putt.
PAM WARNER:  How far would you say the first putt was?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  The putt?  About 20 feet.  I was probably about 25 yards from the pin because I hit it pretty right there.
PAM WARNER:  Then birdie on 15.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  15, that's the par 5?  Okay.  Sorry, I'm trying to go through it in my head.
PAM WARNER:  That's okay.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I don't remember that one.
Q.  You were in the rough to the right?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I was in the rough right?
Q.  For your second shot.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I'm drawing a blank.  I'm sorry.
Q.  Were you kind of near the rough on the right?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Oh, yes.  Thanks for reminding me.  Yeah, I hit my second shot into the right rough and I had about 40 yards and I pitched it to about 15 feet and made the birdie putt.
PAM WARNER:  Then birdie on 17.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  17, I hit a 5 iron to about seven feet.  And made that putt.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 18.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  18, I hit a pitching wedge to about 15 feet and made that putt.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 1.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  1, I hit a choke pitching wedge to about five feet.  And made that putt.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 2.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  2, I hit another choke down pitching wedge to about 12 feet.  Made the putt.
PAM WARNER:  Bogey on 3.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  3, I hit a 9 iron to about maybe 30 feet.  And 3 putted.
PAM WARNER:  Then double bogey on 6.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  6, I hooked my drive left into the trees.  And I hit it out and I was still in the rough.  I hit a pitching wedge short and then I had like maybe 15 yards, pitched it up and then to about seven feet and missed the putt.
PAM WARNER:  Then bogey on 8.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  8, I hit a lob wedge that was I think 80 yards.  But I was kind of in like an old divot.  So I tried to punch it, but it was    the ground was so wet that it just dug under it and I was short.  I chipped it to about seven feet again and missed the putt.
PAM WARNER:  We'll take questions.
Q.  Given the fact that you had it to 10 under, are you disappointed at where you stand?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  A little bit.  Because, yeah, I was swinging it good and I was putting really well.

But I just put myself in good contention for the weekend, there's still a lot of golf left to play, 36 holes, and I just want to just keep the momentum up.
Q.  Have you played with Michelle before and was the crowd a factor at all in the two days?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  No, I never played with her before.  The crowd was fine.  I love playing in crowds.  When I was winning leading tournaments, you know, the crowds were the same, so it wasn't a big deal.
Q.  You kind of fed off that a little bit?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I did.  I like having people watch and whether they're watching me or Michelle or anybody, it's good to just have people out there watching your group.
Q.  Did you take a lesson recently?  What kind of stuff did you work on?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Well, yes, I had a lesson with my instructor Brian Gathright in San Antonio and I changed my swing about two years ago and sometimes my old swing and my new swing clash, which I think that happened on number 6 when I hooked my driver a little.

So I was just kind of doing drills on trying to keep my head still and not lean and just little things.  Just kind of fine tuning it, like a car.
Q.  That swing that you had on 6, was that the first bad swing you had this tournament?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  Yes, it is.
Q.  Still the only one at this point?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  I hope so.
Q.  Is there anything about Michelle's game that playing with her that surprised you or that stood out?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  She hits it really long.  She's a good player.  And they keep forgetting that she's only 16.  She will get even better.
Q.  Where was your game at that point in your life?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  It's almost how I play now.  I just don't hit it as far as Michelle, but when I was 16 I won the U.S. Junior Girls and I was just out there just playing and winning tournaments.
Q.  How did you get into the game again?
DOROTHY DELASIN:  My dad taught me how to play.  And I didn't like it at first, because I couldn't hit the ball.  And then I won my first junior tournament when I was 10 and I looked at my dad and I was like, yeah, I want to be a professional golfer when I grow up.
PAM WARNER:  Any other questions?  Thank you, Dorothy.
DOROTHY DELASIN:  You got it.
