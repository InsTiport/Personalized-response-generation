 DOROTHY DELASIN: Everything. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah. It doesn't get any better than this. This is like winning the
Lotto. I'm just happy. I can't explain it. You've just got to trust me on that. 
 
Q. Jimin said she asked you for putting lessons out there. You didn't miss any putts
all day. Tell us about your putting out there.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I did miss some. I felt really confident with my putting. I had like a
no-fear attitude. But when it came to downhill putts, I was like: Yeah, right. 
 
Q. Had you been that way all week or just today, this morning, you decided?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I think my last matches I've been doing it. Qualifying round, my first
round wasn't that aggressive. I just wanted to 2-putt everything. Now I'm just going for
the hole. 
 
Q. After you shot 31 on the front side, how confident were you that you could close the
deal?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Actually, I wasn't that confident, because I know Jimin is a really
good player. She can get me any time. I guess she was just waiting for an opportunity for
me to blow up somehow, and I'm glad I didn't. 
 
Q. She played good on the front, too.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah. She shot -- I know she shot a couple under. 
 
Q. 2-under.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Lucky, I guess. I didn't know that. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Oh, really? I guess because it was Jimin. She made me play -- she made
me do -- that didn't come out right. Well, I had to do what I had to do. 
 
Q. What was the score when you beat her the last time?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: 2-1. 
 
Q. Does this change any plans for what you're going to do in the immediate future?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Still haven't decided. I have to talk to USGA people and my parents
when I get back tonight. I don't think I'm going to sleep. 
 
Q. How about that bear hug Sonny gave you on the 15th?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I didn't know he was going to do that. I thought he was just going to
give me a high-five. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I was there by myself. 
 
Q. How does that compare with having him here and caddying for you?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: It's pretty much the same. Having him here is just like, you know,
sharing it; sharing the moment. 
 
Q. Were you surprised at how emotional you were when you won?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I tried not to cry. It just came out worse. (Laughter.) 
 
Q. How tired did you get?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I got pretty tired. At the end, everything just came out: Tired,
happiness -- everything. 
 
Q. What made you decide to wear your long pants today?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I thought I was going to go for the Dorothy Delasin look. (Laughter.) 
 
Q. You get into the next two Opens, and then there's a strong possibility you will be
on the Curtis Cup team. How significant of factors are those in your decision to stay an
amateur or turn pro?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I don't know. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I've got an aunt in Germany. So I've got to talk to my parents. 
 
Q. Are you going to leave this tournament a more confident golfer?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah. This is definitely going to help me build more confidence in my
game. I think I matured a little more. 
 
Q. You probably knew you were good. But now, you have to see yourself as one of the
best amateurs in the country. How does that make you feel?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I think I got really lucky in this tournament. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Because there's so many great players out here. I didn't expect to
come this far. I mean, two years ago it was just like, you know, third round, first round.
I was like: All right, I'll try next year. And it's just luck. I had a lot of big breaks
out there. I think luck comes with it. 
 
Q. Had you been playing well coming in? Did you have a sense that this kind of play was
about to happen?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: No. I didn't expect to shoot this -- you know, play this good in the
end. I mean, my practice rounds were just like 1-over, even par. I was like: Uh-oh, I'm in
trouble. Because a lot of people are shooting under. And I guess, as the week went by, I
just got into a groove if I play better. 
 
Q. What was the strong point the whole week in your game?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Probably my irons and putting. I hit a lot of greens. I had a couple
of chunk shots, but I saved them. 
 
Q. Any hole that was the turning point today, you think, if you had to look back on
anything?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: No. I just kept on going good. Match Play, anything can happen. You
can be 4-up and then go through the 18th hole and lose on the extra holes or something. 
 
Q. 16 and 17 in the morning, though, was a pretty good swing. She's in close at 16 and
misses the putt, and then you knock it stiff at 17, and you very easily could have gone to
lunch all square.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah, that was a big part of the game today, those two holes. She was
-- she missed her putt on 16, and I had this -- I don't know. I don't know how far it was,
but it was pretty long to me, and I made it. And I was like: Okay, I can do this. And I
just kept going. I didn't turn back. I mean, if she'd win a hole, I'd try to win the next
one. Just try to get back what I'd lost. 
 
Q. What was it about this golf course that seemed to fit with your game?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I think because most of the holes were dogleg-left, and I've played
most of my drives to hook. And then I think that was it. 
 
Q. But a good amount of length, which also was the case at South Dakota.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Really? I don't know. Grace was really beating me on that one. 
 
Q. But as far as your game is concerned, it was the kind of course that you could just
play said steadily.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah, like what I said before. Ball on the fairway. Ball on the green.
Ball in the hole. 
 
Q. So who is going to make the decision on turning pro, you? Your mom? Your dad?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Combination of all three of us. 
 
Q. What do you want to do?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I don't know. I want to do both. Laughter. 
 
Q. When you came here this week, you seemed to be leaning towards turning professional;
is that correct?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Win or lose. I thought I was going to lose. I was like: I'll just turn
pro. 
 
Q. Where is that going to go?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Right above my bed. I've got the Junior right next; so, I'm going to
putt it right next to it. 
 
Q. Do they know you have that? Just kidding.
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Oh, yeah. And I can put the trophy right next to it. 
 
Q. Where is wherein the house did the Junior trophy stay?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Right next to my bed. 
 
Q. And you've got the flag from the Junior?
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: Which is the 14th? And right now, it's right on top of my bed on the
wall, and this one is going to go right next to it. 
 
 DOROTHY DELASIN: I feel honored to put my name with the great players of all time. And
it's just an honor. I didn't expect to put my name there; and I did, and it's just
unbelievable.
