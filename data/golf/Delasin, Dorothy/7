DOROTHY DELASIN: I feel great. I'm overwhelmed. And I didn't expect to get this far,
and I did.

Q. From the outset, you looked like you were crisp on everything that you were hitting.
Is that how you felt?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah. I hit a couple of thin shots, and I got lucky out of it. It was
a lucky day.

Q. Do you feel like you were struggling with anything today?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Not really. I felt confident. Every shot I hit, my putting was all
right, too.

Q. Talk about holes 8 and 9, and then when you go up by 3 making the turn. What did you
feel like? You're in the driver's seat, and it's still Kellee Booth, and you've got to put
her away.

DOROTHY DELASIN: I didn't see her shots on 8 and 9. I wasn't watching. I hit my shot
and hit it behind. I was like: Oh, it's going to be short. And I looked, and it got on.
And: Wow, okay, I'll take that any time. On the 9th hole, I hit my shot -- I think I hit
first. I didn't see her shot; I wasn't watching. I didn't see her ball on the green, so
just 2-putt. That's all I wanted to do. I didn't want to risk on 3-putting anything.

Q. And when you make the turn at 3-up, what's your thought process?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I think that was the turning point. I felt confident. I didn't want to
make any mistakes. I just wanted to play steady throughout the round.

Q. How many birdies did you have on the back? Just 16, or any other birdies?

DOROTHY DELASIN: 12 -- 10, 11, 12.

Q. So you were 4-under today?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I think so.

Q. No bogeys on the back?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Mm-mmm.

Q. Talk about that second shot on 16.

DOROTHY DELASIN: I choked up on a 6-iron. I was about 160, I think. And I knew the pin
was in the front; so I chipped it up. And since it was -- my ball was above my feet. I was
aiming right, because I knew it would go left. And it hit the green.

Q. How close?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I think it was from this chair to your chair.

Q. Three feet.

DOROTHY DELASIN: I just didn't want to 2-putt it. It just went in.

Q. What did you think when you saw it land there? Did you think: I've got it?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I was like: This is it. Just 2-putt.

Q. Your feelings about being so close to the title now?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I'm just going to play good tomorrow. Play my game. I just want to
play my game.

Q. Your shot on 6, did you know it was that close after you hit it? You were two feet
on 6.

DOROTHY DELASIN: I have a really bad memory. I've got to go from 1 to 2. I swinged it
pretty good. It felt good. I just -- I just hope you're close. And then people were
clapping. And when Kellee hit, they had a louder clap; so, I thought hers was close. I was
like: Uh-oh, hers is closer. I've got to putt this one. And I went up there, and mine was
actually closer.

Q. What's your background? Have you finished high school?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Mm-hmm.

Q. And what are your plans? Are you going to go to college? Do you want to turn pro?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I want to turn pro. I don't know if I'm going to play the Curtis Cup.
Just see what my parents and USGA -- and if I play, turn pro after that.

Q. Curtis Cup is next year. You're definitely not going to turn pro this year, or you
haven't decided?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I have to discuss that with my parents.

Q. How are your feet today? Were they okay?

DOROTHY DELASIN: They are okay.

Q. Still hurting or not?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Not really. Maybe tomorrow.

Q. Obviously, Kellee struggled a little bit. But when you're playing this well, you
feel like you could have beaten the best Kellee Booth when you're 4-under after 16 holes?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I felt solid through the round. I made a couple mistakes, but I fixed
it, and I recovered. 

Q. What did you struggle with the most, or did you struggle with anything?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I don't know. I missed a couple of greens, but that was it.

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah. I kind of matured. Now, I mean, I don't give up as easily as I
did before. I guess that's what got me here.

Q. Was your dad talking to you today out there? Did he say anything interesting?

DOROTHY DELASIN: He was talking a lot.

Q. Did you tell him to shut up or just keep talking?

DOROTHY DELASIN: On some holes.

Q. What's your dad's name?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Sonny.

DOROTHY DELASIN: She's a dentist at a dental clinic.

Q. What's her name?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Salfe.

Q. Have you ever gone head-to-head with Jimin Kang before?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yes, '96 U.S. Junior Girls. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
like 3-down, and then I had to like birdie five holes in a row to get her.

Q. So you won?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yes.

Q. What round was that?

DOROTHY DELASIN: First round.

Q. That's the only time you've played?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah.

Q. What do you think about her game?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I think she's -- like she was before; a great player.

Q. What are your thoughts on playing her? Does it matter who you play tomorrow?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I've just got to play my game. Anything can happen.

DOROTHY DELASIN: I don't know yet. Maybe.

Q. How many events have you played now this summer?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I played a couple Pepsi TOUR events, like seven as an amateur. The
State, Public Links. 

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah, everything happened in '96.

DOROTHY DELASIN: Yeah.

Q. How many have you won this year?

DOROTHY DELASIN: I won a Pepsi Tour event against the ladies. And the rest were played
against the men.

Q. And how did you do? You said you won you played in your State Am this year? The
Pepsi TOUR event the Public Links and what else?

DOROTHY DELASIN: Just this one.
