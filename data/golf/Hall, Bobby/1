Q. We've got Bobby Hall, rules official here, talking about Derek Lowe.
BOBBY HALL: On hole No. 14, Derek Lowe drove his ball into the lateral water hazard on the left side and he dropped improperly.
He dropped more than two club lengths from the last point that it crossed the margin of the hazard.  And the other option to keep that between him and the hole was not available to him, and also he could have returned to the tee.
But he didn't exercise those options.  He tried to drop under Rule 24(3)(c), but he dropped improperly.  So it was a two-shot penalty.  And he made 7 on hole No. 14.
Q. So his score now, that's going to affect his score with a triple bogey.
BOBBY HALL: Yes.  And we questioned him at the scoring tent and he agreed that where he dropped is not under the rules of golf.  He was very polite and very much a gentleman about the issue.
Q. A two-stroke penalty?
BOBBY HALL: That's correct.
Q. As far as Stableford points, he went from, what, he had a bogey originally and went to a triple.  So now instead of zero points, it's minus two?
BOBBY HALL: That is correct, sir.
