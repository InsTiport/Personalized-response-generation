Q. Spent the year chasing around the Challenge Tour. How does it feel to come out here and put up that result?
CHASE KOEPKA: It's nice. You know, didn't really have the success on the Challenge Tour this year that I would've liked. I was a bit homesick being over there.
I took some time to kind of regroup and figure some things out for myself, get a little happier. Definitely showed today on the golf course. Had some fun out there and it was nice to see that result.
Q. Easier said that done, but how do you get happier?
CHASE KOEPKA: Honestly, I think it was just kind of being around the my family a little bit. I feel like I've been so separate from them for the last couple years just being over in Europe. I mean, it's hard. Spent a lot of weeks over there.
Earlier this year I did a nine-week stretch over there and that was very tolling on me mentally.
It's nice to have my family here this week, so...
Q. Practice rounds with Brooks get you ready to rumble? He said he spent some time with you out here.
CHASE KOEPKA: Yeah, we played together on Tuesday. Obviously he's almost won here before, so it was nice to see his thoughts on different tee shots, how certain holes kind of play in the morning versus late in the afternoon.
Big temperature change. We noticed it out there on the front nine how far the ball was going, and definitely I'll have to adjust tomorrow morning. Obviously learning from him.
Q. What were you happiest without there today?
CHASE KOEPKA: Honestly, that I remained bogey-free. I think that is always nice when you go 18 holes without a bogey. Made a few nice up and downs.
I mean, the one of the day I think was on 11. Hit it so far right and hit it over the green, jailed, and hit it up to like three, four feet. I was just trying to keep the chip on the green so I was pretty happy with that.
Q. This could obviously be big week. What are your plans going forward? Would you go back to Europe? Would you take a shot at Korn Ferry status?
CHASE KOEPKA: Actually missed out on first stage in Europe for Q-School couple weeks ago, and then I got Korn Ferry Q-school next week in Utah, so try and play well in that and get to final stage and get my card through that.
Q. Can you needle him just a little bit when you beat him on a day like today?
CHASE KOEPKA: Yeah. Usually. It's nice. But, you know, he's so good. He's so good. (Laughter.) I do have to needle him every now and then when I do get a chance to nip him on a day like today.
I'm sure he'll hear it over dinner.
