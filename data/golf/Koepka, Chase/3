 Q.  What did you think about the round today versus yesterday?  
CHASE KOEPKA: It was really good today. I felt like I was in position to kind of make some putts out there. I just didn't drive it all that great on the par-5s, which kind of if you drive it in the rough out here on the par-5s it's really tough to get on the greens and whatnot.   
Yeah, I felt like my driver was feeling great all day. Just had one hiccup on the 6th hole out there. Hit a great drive in the fairway. Ended up in a divot and didn't hit any good shots from there and made a quick 6.   
But other than that, it was really nice, really solid. I hit it great all day, so can't complain.   
 Q.  Walk us through what happened greenside there on 6.  
CHASE KOEPKA: Yeah, I mean, the wedge shot just kind of came out -- didn't come out as good as I wanted it to and just came up short. I thought it was going to come out hot out of the divot. And then the next one, it looked like it was sitting okay, and I just caught a little bit -- yeah, maybe thought it was a little too good of a lie. It was just so grainy right around there and I just flubbed it and it rolled right back to my feet.   
Next shot I actually thought I hit really good. Just came out a little low and just caught the collar of the fringe there. If it just cleared that would've been a couple feet if not going in and left me about a 12-footer for bogey there.   
And then did not hit a good putt from there, but the rest of the day was great. Hit it where I wanted to. Just kind of got to adjust a little bit better out here for the wedges. Just kind of struggling to land them on my spots right now. Just a little bit of altitude is getting with me. I feel like I'm two, three yards off on landings.   
If I improve on that this weekend I know I can make a run up the leaderboard.   
 Q.  Did you give the needle to Brooks last night?  
CHASE KOEPKA: Actually didn't get to chance to see him. He went off to a show, so that was probably good for him. I would've probably talked his ear off at dinner, which I usually do.   
 Q.  Will you be waiting for him tonight?  
CHASE KOEPKA: I don't know. We'll see. Hopefully he gets done quick and we can go grab some dinner.   
 Q.  You're in position to top 10 here. Have you thought about if you top 10 here what are you going to do next week?  
CHASE KOEPKA: No. I'll figure that out Sunday night.   
 Q.  Looked like you had shot 61 earlier this summer in Italy and couldn't finished the tournament or didn't finish the tournament. What happened?  
CHASE KOEPKA: I think I was 1-over or something like that for the tournament, and I hit a couple -- it was like 110 degrees there and it was -- and the heat index was over 120 there. I wasn't feeling good throughout the whole day. I was struggling to just find cool water out there. I felt like nothing in the bins were helping.   
Hit a couple drives on the par-4 and apparently we lost like of my two balls that were down the middle of the fairway, and one of them apparently went like 380 and one went like 400 into some bushes.   
And then I just started hacking around and I was like, Man, I am just not feeling good. I needed to get in and cool myself off. Luckily I got my body a little bit better. The week after I played well. I was kind of happy I made that decision to take care of my body a little bit out there in that 120 plus degree heat.   
 Q.  How does it feel to make your first cut?  
CHASE KOEPKA: Feels good. Feels like the hard work that I've been putting in last month or so I've been home, it's been really nice. I'm just looking forward to this weekend getting off to a hot start on the greens.   
 Q.  What's the first thing that comes to your mind about this experience so far past two days?  
CHASE KOEPKA: Just how like calming it was out there. I felt like I was in control of my emotions and I feel like I really just -- I was just really proud of myself.   
 Q.  Big picture this week can be very meaningful for you. How do you keep it in perspective?  
CHASE KOEPKA: Yeah, I mean, it's going to -- it's tough, but like you said, you got to keep it one shot at a time. I think I'm going to do that by just focusing on what's ahead.   
I'm really not going to change anything. I feel like I've done a really good job of looking where I need to hit it on these greens, and if I do a little bit better job this weekend, I can definitely make a run.
