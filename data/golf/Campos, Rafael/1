 Q.   How do you feel about the warm reception you had all throughout the course here today?  
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   No, it was awesome, especially today, I knew that playing with John Daly it was going to be a nice crowd pleaser.  
No, it's truly gratifying to see so many people come and support you.   You know, we're always traveling outside.   We're never here in Puerto Rico, so you would think that nobody's really paying much attention, but it really is great to see so many people just supporting you and just cheering you on.   
There were a lot of people today really.   I knew our group was one of the ones that would have the most crowd, and they didn't disappoint at all.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel yesterday's 6‑under, did that give you the confidence to go out today and try to be aggressive and try to replicate that low score?  
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Yeah.   No, definitely.   Yesterday wasn't‑‑ first I actually hit the ball well.   I thought I had control, and it was a very calm day, so I knew the scores were going to be low, and I didn't know I was going to get fines.   But yeah, definitely just shooting that good round yesterday definitely gave me good confidence knowing that you never know what can happen in golf.   You can have the best round of your life and all of a sudden you end up either winning or being in the top 3.   So we were definitely looking forward to today.   We got off to a good start, and we kind of slowed down a little bit in the middle of the round.  
Two par‑5s on the last four holes, you should be able to take advantage, and I didn't take advantage of them.   So that's the only disappointing part of the day, but overall I'm very happy with just being here and playing for the home crowd.  
   
 Q.   With this good finish here looking forward where do you see your game going and what are your plans for the future?  
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   No, definitely, my game's definitely getting better.   That's one of the things, I'm really working hard lately in some areas of the game, and I can clearly see they're getting better.  
This sport is really uphill all the time.   So in the next couple of weeks I'll be heading to South America.   I'm going back to my tour, and I'll be in Guadalajara, Guatemala and Mexico for the next three weeks.   I do have a week off now, so I'm happy for that.   I can rest a little bit.   This week is always very tiresome.  
But after that, I do see myself very close.   I'm getting better.   I know I'm doing better, so that gives me a little more confidence.   Just looking forward to go out and play some more tournaments and try to get a win under my belt.  
   
 Q.   Thank you for the time.   Congratulations and lots of success.   Give me a little quick recap of the week.   
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Quick recap.   Thursday was not the best day in the world really.   I had a tough time really just trying to figure out what the ball was doing and how I felt with my swing.   There were a couple of very important shots, though, the first day, and really couldn't convert anything.  
Second day I knew I had to come out and hit the ball decent.   You know, I didn't hit the ball great, but I did keep the ball in play.   Seemed a little bit easier.   Wind picked up in the afternoon, so I knew scores really weren't going to be all that low, but surprisingly enough, they were different.   They were actually very low.  
And making the cut kind of just gave me a little bit more of relief so I can actually show these guys, you know, hey, I can play.   Third day, no wind, very calm.   I actually did feel under control.   I felt I had everything‑‑ I knew where the ball was going.   I knew where my misses were going to go, and played okay.   Didn't make everything, but I saw some good extras.   So happy with the third round.  
And today I did get off to a good start.   I was 3‑under after six or something like that, so I kind of figured, hey, you know, we can make a move.   And was just not seeing a lot of things go in the hole.   Was hitting the ball okay.   Definitely hitting a lot of greens, giving myself some opportunities, but I was just not seeing the ball go in.   I got to the tenth hole, made a birdie there.   And since then it was just kind of a struggle.  
You know, a little bit of a struggle.   I was hitting the greens.   I was definitely hitting the greens giving myself some looks, but they were just too far.   Could not convert on the two par‑5s in the finishing holes, which that would have definitely given me a nice jump up the leaderboard, but hey, that's golf.   Overall I'm very happy with at least knowing that I started very slow and finished with three decent rounds here at least in front of the Puerto Ricans.  
   
 Q.   Two solid years, made the cut.   Played well.   What do you attribute that to?  
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Just the practice really.   I know I have the game to compete with these guys.   I've known it for a long time really.   I just didn't really put the time necessary like in the game.   And decided to change a lot of things in the last year or so, and I definitely see the results.   I definitely see a big change.   You know, it's easier for me to score, even on bad days.   
Just what do I attribute to, like good playing the last couple of years, well, it's just time I'm putting into practice, you know.   Just hitting balls, just chipping a lot, putting a lot, just trying to see‑‑ get my muscles memorized for the same motion all the time, and at the same time go out and have fun.   I try to do that.   Doesn't look like it because I'm all serious on the golf course and all that, but I just don't want to get over pumped or too down.   That's all.  
   
 Q.   Do you attribute any of that to the NEC LatinÃ³america?   
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Definitely.   I mean I'm already used to playing tournaments and playing with great players, so that's why I don't feel any nerves or pressure just playing with these guys because it's exactly the same thing as we see every week.   So no, it's definitely thanks to the NEC LatinÃ³america, PGA TOUR LatinÃ³america.   I mean golf is easier for us now because we know there's a lot of golfers down in South America, and we know they deserve to be here.   A couple of them on the Web.com right now are in the Top 5, so they might win today.   We know we have game down there and we know we can compete with these guys, so definitely thanks to them at least the pressure and the nerves and all those things are gone.   So we're definitely thankful to have that tour for us.
