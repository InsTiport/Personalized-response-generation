Q.   What are your expectations for the week in this sixth edition of the Puerto Rico Open presented by seepuertorico.com?
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   I want to get off to a good start this year. I ve had a problem getting off to a good start in the first round in the past and I want to do a better job of doing that now. I ve worked really hard on my game the past few years and I feel really good about my game and where it is at the moment. I have no doubt that if I stay confident with the changes in my game I have no have no doubt that I can finish among the top finishers in this event.   A good start makes your week much easier.

Q.   What has prevented you from success in the past?
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   I think I was trying too hard and taking it way too seriously. I wasn t taking time to enjoy myself and that s what I m focusing on this year to just take it easy and have more fun with it. I know I have the game, I have the talent I just want to focus on enjoying it a bit more.   This is a great opportunity and I ve practiced very hard so I hope it works out well.

Q.   What areas of your game have you worked on particularly?
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   I ve focused on the entire swing really, late last year I started   looking at video of my swing and looking at the areas I needed to improve on since the season was over and I knew I had some time to look at and work on my swing. So from last December through February I ve been working on my swing with video and my coaches.
