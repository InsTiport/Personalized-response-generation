Q.   Just tell us a little bit about your round. 
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Yeah, well, got off to not such a great start, really.   Just kind of just trying to figure out, get a good rhythm and just put the ball in play.   I wasn't scoring at the beginning, got it back a little bit the mid‑round.   I started feeling okay.   Fortunately on the 16th hole‑‑ well, No.7, my club really slipped and I shanked a ball out.
Apart from that, it was just an up‑and‑down day, really, nothing too bad.   I just didn't score.   It was a little frustrating.   The course was in great shape, so we've still got tomorrow to get a good round going and obviously move up the leaderboard.

Q.   Wind is always a factor on this course.   It seems like in the afternoon it was definitely a factor.   Did you kind of struggle with that a little bit?
RAFAEL CAMPOS:   Yeah, at the beginning, definitely.   We teed off close to 1:00 so the wind was up already.   Yeah, there was a couple holes where you have into the wind and you're not really sure, sometimes like it's just swirling a little bit, so you don't really know which way in that moment the wind is going.   Yeah, wind is definitely a factor.   I know afternoon waves have it a little bit more.   It's just a matter of being able to take advantage tomorrow morning, get off to a good start, and go from there, really.
