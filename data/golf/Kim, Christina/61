Q.  We're here with Christina Kim.  What an incredible first experience for you.
CHRISTINA KIM:  No doubt, I can't even put to words what I'm feeling right now.  I lost my voice.  I've gained so much just spirit and love from all of these people here, and especially on a day like today, just to remember all the people that we lost in 9/11, to know that we can take that Cup and represent our country, and do it with pride and grace and class, it's unbelievable.
Q.  You became an American favorite at the Solheim Cup here in 2005.  The crowd absolutely loved you.  What do you want to say with them?
CHRISTINA KIM:  All I can really say to them is thank you, thank you so much, thank you for coming out and supporting the American team.  We feed off of you as much as you feed off of us.  Without you guys screaming and supporting you, I know I couldn't have come close to playing how well I did this week.
Q.  Congratulations on your rookie debut.
CHRISTINA KIM:  Thank you so much, Val.
