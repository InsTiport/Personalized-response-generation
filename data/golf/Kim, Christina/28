  Q. Very convincing win today. How exciting was it out there?  
 CHRISTINA KIM: It was an absolute thrill. I love to play both foursomes as well as fourball, and I love the atmosphere. It's what Solheim Cup is all about, and I really enjoyed myself, had a phenomenal partner out there, and we were able to just feed off each other, you know?   
  
  Q. Talk about today. You guys could technically pull away. Obviously it's not over, but how much momentum do you think it gave the team for you guys to win like that?  
 CHRISTINA KIM: Oh, for us to win the first team out, I thought it was huge. We started off two down through two, and to show the team that we were able to go from being two down through two after Helen and Tania played some fantastic golf yesterday. After watching the two of them play so well on television yesterday, it was great to be able to say that Michelle and I made a great enough team we were able to beat such two great players, and it was pretty impressive.
