 Q.  Can you tell us about how you played today? 
 CHRISTINA KIM:  Yeah, you know, we were both kind of struggling out there for a little bit, we weren't playing poorly or anything.  We just weren't playing stellar.  Then I just birdied my last three holes and then I was like, you know, holy cow I'm running out of holes, so you have to do something.  I just gave it one last gusto and gave it a little more gusto and just had one last run and made a couple of putts coming in. 

 Q.  Do you think the match-play format maybe gives you a little extra adrenaline towards the end, a little extra something to play for the last few holes? 
 CHRISTINA KIM:  Yeah, absolutely.  At first you're just plugging along and you're thinking, okay, you've got to play the better tee shot than them, you have to hit a better approach shot than them, you have to make a better putt than them.  And after a while you start getting so tired.  Then when you start realizing that you have only so many holes left and you start calculating, if I win this hole and this hole and this hole; if she wins hole, do we have to play this hole again. 
 It's one of those things where I guess I'm one of those like, you know, last-minute, give-it-a-go kind of person. 

 Q.  Can you talk about playing in the area of Westchester, how you like the area? 
 CHRISTINA KIM:  Well, you know, all of the courses in the Westchester area are great.  Wykagyl, this is a beautiful course, they redid it over the last year and I think that the crew, the course maintenance and everybody associated with the club should be very proud.  The course is in beautiful shape.  You know, it's tough to say it, but it's even better than it was the last couple of years.  It's a perfect match-play golf course I think.
