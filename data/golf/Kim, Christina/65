Q.  It was a tough match, but all in all, a good day for you?
CHRISTINA KIM:  Yeah, we have had difficulty in the past.  We were able to keep up with the Europeans in the first couple of days when it comes to points.  Today, we showed the Europeans that we got those two points we lost yesterday, so they need to look out for tomorrow.
Q.  What about your match today?
CHRISTINA KIM:  That's what you need to do when it comes to match play.  That's what they did.  That's what they did on 9, 10, 11, 12, birdies.  I don't know how many they made, but they made a lot of birdies.  They're two of the best players in the world, so that's that.
