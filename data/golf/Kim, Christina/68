CHRISTINA KIM:  A lot

of veterans told me if you puke on the 1st hole, it wouldn't be the first time, but as opposed to puking, I wanted to bawl my eyes out.  I was terrified.  I had no idea    I felt like I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  It was the most emotional moment in my entire life, no doubt.  I think this is what golf is all about.  You have the same crowd that you would normally have in a regular LPGA event, but they're on something, I don't know what they're doing, but you get some emotions out there that you wouldn't expect to see on the golf course.

We had them right where we wanted and momentum just changed, which can happen, but it wasn't one of those thing that you wanted to crawl into a hole and die.

I left everything out there.  I've still got a little bit of my voice left.  I'm going to go cheer on my teammates in the last hole.
