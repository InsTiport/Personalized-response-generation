 Q. Christina, did you realize at 17 what was happening?
 CHRISTINA KIM: I didn't realize that Morgan had already clinched the putt until I walked up No. 18 green. 
 I still thought that my match was potentially going to define whether or not we kept the Cup, and I kept the mentality all the way through the green, and you know, we won.

 Q. You know, you did secure the point that won the Cup. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Did I? Nice. Thank you. 

 Q. Your match today against Tania was really momentum in the end and the emotion that the crowd had with you taking you down 17, what was that like for you?
 CHRISTINA KIM: You know, it was so hard. I mean it's Solheim Cup, you know. Most unbelievable thing in the world. 
 And you know, it's been four years in the making, and you know, this is the greatest moment of my life, the entire week. 
 You know, the crowds have been phenomenal. You know, for both teams there has been so much support, and you know, they're like our 13th player out there. There's no question. We love you guys! 

 Q. Thank you Christina, congratulations.
