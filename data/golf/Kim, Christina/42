   CHRISTINA KIM: Just went out there and had a wonderful day. I started off with a bogey, which kind of pissed me off to no end and just went on a birdie barrage, especially on the front side, just went out and enjoyed myself. I'm quite pleased with how I've played the last couple of weeks and feeling really good.  
  
  Q. You've had two back-to-back great finishes now on the verge of the second major of the year. Does that give you some confidence heading into McDonald's?  
 CHRISTINA KIM: It's three weeks away, so that's really far away. Actually I'm taking next week off, so it's only one event away. Yeah, I'm thrilled to be playing well so close to a major, but anything can happen. Any given day things can change, so I'm just taking it day by day and just enjoying myself more than anything.  
  
  Q. Any plans for the off week?  
 CHRISTINA KIM: Shopping, lots and lots of shopping. No, just relaxing and taking some time off and just enjoying myself. You know, I've had a long five weeks, and I'm glad that I have the ability to choose to do nothing if I want.
