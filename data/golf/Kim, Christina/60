CHRISTINA KIM:  Because everyone, all the veterans, said even though we were down the first day, that's pretty good for us, because we haven't always been very strong when it comes to the fourball and the alternate shot.

So we were just trying to keep ourselves paced and trying to stay steady.  We came charging today, and Nancy gave us inspiration.  She gave us so much motivation and drive.  We just came out and did it.  We did it.
Q.  Congratulations, Christina.
