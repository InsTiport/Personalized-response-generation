Q.  Natalie, pretty exciting day out there today I know it was for both of you.  Christina, obviously, in the first group for a reason, to incite the crowd.

Your thoughts on getting off to a very important foursome victory?

NATALIE GULBIS:  Christina and I knew we had great chemistry.  Nancy Lopez did a great job to make sure we were prepared to play.

We're proud to come out this morning and get it done.
Q.  Christina, no secret you feed off the crowd, and the crowd feeds off you.  What was it like for you out here today?  Do you think there was a good reason for you to go out there in the first group?

CHRISTINA KIM:  I definitely do.  Nancy Lopez and Donna Caponi, are brilliant women.  Both Natalie and I feed off the crowd.  We thrive of it.  The crowds are so much better than they were yesterday.  They're out there for us.  This is such a great accomplishment for the both of us.  Rookies against rookies, and we came out on top.
