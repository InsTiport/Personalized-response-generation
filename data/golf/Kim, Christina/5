 Q.  What kind of pulled you into this nice area that you are in now?  
CHRISTINA KIM: I've been swinging really, really well, and I've been putting really, really well.   
My father took a look at my everything and was like, uh-uh, we've got to change this.  So basically from how I look at the shot that I'm hitting into how I'm stepping into the ball, let alone the actual physical swing, I've made a huge overhaul with my dad back in Orlando.   
It takes a little bit of time getting comfortable, getting used to the shots.  I'm still honestly not that comfortable with it, because it's something that I've been -- I'm now trying to get away from with a couple items here and there, whatever, from what I've been doing for 15, 20 years.  Just trying to refresh everything.   
Plus I turned 32 this year, and my dad is like you played pretty good when you were 16, so why don't you try to pretend like you're only half your age when you're on the golf course.
