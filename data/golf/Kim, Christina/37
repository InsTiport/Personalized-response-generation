 Q. You're playing well, can you talk about your round?
 CHRISTINA KIM: It was a really up-and-down round. I was 3-under through like five holes, 3-under through five and I ended up holing one and with the wind it was pretty cold. Winds were coming out of the southwest or something so it was pretty tough out there.
 It was good, I missed a lot of opportunities but I played with Karen and I had a great time.

 Q. You're within a couple strokes of the lead, what's it like going into the final round now after 36 holes?
 CHRISTINA KIM: It feels good to be up somewhere near the top. It's been a while. The fact that I'm anywhere near the top is pretty great. It's good to remember what it feels like, that's pretty nice and just going out there tomorrow and just trying to grind it out and hopefully be the KOLON Bank girl.

 Q. What's it like with the crowd?
 CHRISTINA KIM: The crowds are great. A lot of people have their camera phones but that's just something you expect when you come out here. You can just have ear muffs and muffle all the noise.
 It's great to see so many people out here. I probably have a few thousand members and fans, so even if I was playing bad I would have a good following. First time in this country, it's great to see the support that we get.

 Q. What would it mean to you to win? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Well, I think it would be -- I understand that I am certainly a controversial person in this country to say the least but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. It would be a bit of a vindication for me if I were to come out and win. It would be huge. It's been a long time since I've won. It's been three years just about and to come back and win, here especially, would be very, very special. 
 I'm trying my best to reach out and interact with everybody and if some people don't like me, it's just like in America, they don't like me.
