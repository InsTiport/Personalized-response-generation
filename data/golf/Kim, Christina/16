  CHRISTINA KIM:   It was a great day out there today.   I had a wonderful pairing with Ryann O'Toole who I played with on Solheim Cup as well as Madison Pressel, who is one of the big stars this week, one of the collegiate amateurs.   So I had a wonderful pairing.   And just a great day, a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   How was the course?  
CHRISTINA KIM:   The course was awesome.   This is actually a very atypical golf course than what we normally play just because we have to play our ball.   You know, it's normally just hit it down the middle and hit it onto the green and then you gotta work on your putts.   But out here it's demanding of every shot.   I think I touched almost every club in my bag and I love playing a golf course where you can do that.  
   
 Q.   This is not going to be an easy competition.   What do you have to do to really stay ahead of the group?  
CHRISTINA KIM:   You know, in order to stay ahead, you just gotta keep having the putts drop and just know where you have to hit it and more than that know where to miss it.   
And you know, there's going to be a lot of wind.   We are in Texas, everything's bigger, including the wind.   So I think that you know, you gotta be able to play shots high, play 'em low, hit 'em right, hit 'em left.   You gotta have every single shot in the bag.   And I think that's really one of the reasons why I love this place so much.   But it's Texas.   Gotta love Texas, baby.
