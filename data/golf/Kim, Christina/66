CHRISTINA KIM:  It was great getting the first hole in ultimate shot.  I think this is going to help compel us to go out and do well.  We always do well with singles matches and best ball, but this is great.
Q.  Have you ever made a better putt than you did on 15?
CHRISTINA KIM:  I honestly don't think I did.  I told myself, "You know what, putt like you're Rosie Jones."

I was watching her in the afternoon yesterday, and she made everything she looked at.  That was exactly what I was looking for.
Q.  Talk about your determination to make a strong start for your team today.  You guys really took command.
CHRISTINA KIM:  There is nothing more inspiring than watching the first match go out and come out on top, and in the afternoon yesterday, Rosie and Meg came out and was bam, bam, bam, and started off hot, and that's what I wanted to do.
Q.  Thanks, Christina.
