 Q.   Branden has had an amazing week?  
JORDAN ZIMMERMAN:   I don't know what's going on in that kid's head.   Definitely I'd like to just go under the scalp of him and go look and find out what's going on in his head because he's certainly figured out this game, and it's showing; he's playing really well.  
   
 Q.   It is four European Tour victories in the season if he holds this together, as well as five for the year.   
JORDAN ZIMMERMAN:   He gave me a hiding last week on fan court.   No, he's been playing unbelievable.   It's hard to try and match him this year, but I think it's just a question of keeping it together and giving it your best.   Obviously it's great inspiration to see that someone who I've played with and beaten a lot over the years is doing that well.   It just goes to show and proves my point that I should be doing a little better.   
It's always nice to see your mate doing well.
