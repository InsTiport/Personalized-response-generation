  Q. Hi. How did the round feel? Obviously it was a good warmup.  
 ANNA RAWSON: Yeah. It felt pretty good. Yeah, I like the course. It felt great today, and the greens were really receptive as far as the pins, so it was a fun.  
  
  Q. I guess it was a career low for you, on the LPGA Tour?  
 ANNA RAWSON: Oh, yes, on the LPGA, yeah.  
  
  Q. So what went right for you? What part of your game was working the best I guess?  
 ANNA RAWSON: My iron side was really good. I hit a second slice a lot. I probably left a couple of shots out there, but I can improve on that tomorrow, so that's good, but yeah, I think my iron side, yeah, really helped.   
  
  Q. Anna, you set yourself up really well to make your first cut on the LPGA Tour. So what's going through your head? Same game plan for tomorrow or what's your strategy?   
 ANNA RAWSON: Yeah. Yeah. I never play to make the cut. I just play to win, so I think I left a few shots out there. I think it's going to be like 5-, 6-, maybe 7-under, so I'm going to have to play really well again tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Is it nice to kind of make that impact as a rookie, come on tour, have a career low on the Tour at this tournament?  
 ANNA RAWSON: Yeah. Yeah. I haven't been playing -- I haven't started that well yet, so it's going to help, but my game has been fine, it's just mentally struggling, I haven't been playing enough. But this is my third tournament in a row, so I think I kind of need to get into it by the third one.
