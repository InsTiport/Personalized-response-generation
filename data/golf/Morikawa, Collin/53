Q. What's it feel to be a Walker Cup champion?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It's awesome.  To wear the red, white and blue all week since Thursday we got here, it couldn't be a bigger honor than to come out and compete against a GB&I team that two years ago kind of beat us down, it's good to get a little fun back and win.
Q. You had a tough start today, but then you won four holes in a row.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, it's not like I was playing great golf, but I kind of minimized my errors.  Out here in the afternoon it's all about trying to make pars, because birdies won't win all the holes for the most part.  But making bogeys kind of hurts.
Q. Very few players have gone 4-0 and now you're one of them.  What's that feel like?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Oh, it's a dream come true.  I've never really gone undefeated in one of these team events, and just to have some momentum to know that I can do it against these guys, these guys are the best players around the country and the entire world, really.  So just to come out here and I just had a great time with everyone.  All these guys are great on the team and I'm just glad we can come out with a win.
Q. You won at the amateur, you won at the collegiate level, and now you've won wearing the red, white and blue.  How different is that?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It's something special and you can't really explain what it is, I wasn't really nervous on the first tee, in the first shot for the U.S. on Saturday morning, but you just kind of are excited and thrilled that you can get out there and hit a tee ball for your country.  So I'm glad -- it's been a long week, for sure, definitely will get some rest, but it's something that I'll remember forever.
