 Q.  What was the biggest difference from Thursday to Friday?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Just giving myself chances. My shots today, misses today, just weren't working. Put myself in some bad spots that I couldn't really get away with.   
To finish round with two birdies is always good. Gives some momentum into the weekend.   
 Q.  You have to be happy with the fight you put on towards the end there. You're still right there going into the weekend; just one back.  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, it was just a really mediocre day. Obviously wish I was going to take a big lead into today, but that's golf. Got two more days. Game feels good. Just got to figure out the driver a little bit and go from there.   
 Q.  Driver the biggest key to fixing some things over the weekend?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah. I mean, the irons feel really good. I had some right-to-left wind shots with my irons that I kind of pulled left, and you can't do this out here.   
So other than that, just make few more putts. The putt I made on 17 was probably my longest putt all week, but it feels really good. Feels good for the weekend.   
 Q.  Nice rally there. Birdie, birdie finish, huh? What a nice finish. That deuce at 17 was really good.  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It was much needed. It was the first putt of any length really I made yesterday and today. So just gives me a lot of momentum heading into tomorrow and the weekend.   
 Q.  You told me you wanted to improve with your driver. Hit I think seven fairways, up to 10 of 14. Hit the same number of greens; didn't scramble quite as well in the second round as you did in the opening round.  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, I put myself in just some bad spots on 14 and 15. You just can't miss long on either one of those and I did. You just got to get away and take your bogey. There are still birdie chances out there. Just got to put yourself if the fairway, and just need to do a little better job of doing that.   
 Q.  How about on 13, you miss it on the inside leg of the dog leg in the bunker; got a great look at birdie there on a tough hole.  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, I had some birdie looks throughout the entire round. Got lucky with a good lie in there, and just kind of laid open a 5-iron and rode the wind. But those are shots that you need to take advantage of. You need it make those putts.   
I did that yesterday; didn't do it today. See what happens on the weekend.   
 Q.  Did you catch a gust with the three-putt on 4?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: No. It is a little downgrain. I thought it was a little more right to left, and I thought if anything it would move at least a half ball left and just never did.   
I hit good putts today.   
 Q.  Thoughts going into the weekend?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I'm right there in it. Two birdies at the end definitely helped, but there is a lot of guys right around the there, so hopefully we can separate ourselves.
