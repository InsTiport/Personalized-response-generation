 Q.  How would you assess your round out there today?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It was a little more steady. Putting was pretty good today. I thought I would have made a few more. We're seeing a little more speed. Other than that, I think everything is pretty good. Got one more day, and looking forward to it. Hopefully the wind picks up even more.   
 Q.  Do you see it being a real low one tomorrow, or do you feel like it might be something that's a little more manageable, 7-, 8-under?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, I've got to get in the 60s. Can't be in the 70s every single day. But Justin up there, Xander, they're good players. They know how to finish, close out tournaments, so I'm going to need to start off strong. I started off a little better today, but just gave one back when I didn't need to. Got to play smart, got to make some putts. So yeah, we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  Is that kind of the one thing you need to focus on is getting off to a stronger start to get that round going?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, I've just got to be ready by the first hole. Sometimes I tend to start a little slow, and I can't have that happen tomorrow with holes 14 through 16, those are birdie holes, and I didn't really do anything today. I'll have to take advantage of some par-5s that I didn't, make some putts, make some little pitch shots around the greens and just roll them in.
