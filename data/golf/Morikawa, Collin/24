Q. How would you characterize the differences in the course between last week and today?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I think we started noticing things -- I came home Tuesday and you already saw the greens get about a foot, foot and a half faster, and today when we stepped on the course, even though it was morning you could start seeing a little shine, so you know the first bounces were skipping a little more, getting a little firmer.  The rough has obviously just kept growing.  They've put some water on them.  You miss in some spots, sometimes you've got to chip out and you never know what kind of lie you're going to get, but for the most part it's not going to be good.
But yeah, today it played a lot windier, which just made it a little tougher.
Q. How do you think you can adjust and turn it around?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I was 5-over through a three-hole stretch.  I had two three-putts today, so just clean things up for tomorrow and we're perfectly fine.  If we can make a few birdies, hopefully no one takes it too deep.  Looks like the wind is going to stay up, so we'll see what the scores are like.
