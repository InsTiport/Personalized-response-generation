  Q. Excellent round of golf for you today, 8-under par.  Put yourself in position to win.  How do you feel about your chances for tomorrow?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Oh it's all about golf right there, putting yourself in position come Sunday and I've done a really good job, but I have to make a lot of birdies tomorrow.
 Q. You talked about the family that you have here in Hawaii.  What would it mean for you to get a victory in the state of Hawaii?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Oh, it would mean a lot.  Hopefully I can tell you come tomorrow but for now I've got 18 more holes and there's a lot of guys that can make a lot of birdies and I've just got to be ready to come hole 1.
 Q. Very solid day out there.  How would you describe your round?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I wouldn't say I was driving the ball as well as I did the past couple days, but I still hit some really good shots.  I made some putts.  And overall you just got to keep momentum going, that's what I did, I got to see Ryan make a lot of birdies and that helps as well just like yesterday.
 Q. Just like yesterday you kind of got to play with a playing partner that was playing well.  Let's talk about tomorrow.  Watching the leaderboard, you're right now 1 back of the lead.  What's your mentality when you have to put another low number on a course that yields those type of numbers?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Like you said, make a lot of birdies.  That's what it's going to come down to, who is going to make the most amount of birdies tomorrow, because guys are just shooting low.  If the winds stay down like they were today, the past day or two, guys are going to keep making birdies, 7-, 8-under is going to be out there and no one is going to let up and let off shots to the field.
 Q. Was there a key stretch to this golf course that you feel like you need to play well to win tomorrow?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I kind of played the middle of the back nine well so far the first three days really, but I think if I just get off to a good start through nine holes -- I stayed really patient today, which was good, even though I was even through 4 and there's a lot of birdie holes out there.
