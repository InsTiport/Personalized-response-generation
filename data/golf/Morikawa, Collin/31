Q. Collin, 3-under par 67 today. Can we get some comments on your day.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was kind of a scrappy day. I started off really well the first two holes, hit it within three feet and just wasn't hitting -- got some unlucky breaks on 3 and 4, but overall kind of brought it back on the back nine. Started hitting it close, started making some putts, and the game feels good. The way I finished on that nine, there was a lot of positives heading into tomorrow.
Q. Just one back on a jam-packed leaderboard. Talk about what it's going to take tomorrow.
RORY McILROY: It's going to take a really good round. The leaderboard is so crowded and so packed with just every great player out there. You're going to have to just play well. You're going to have to start off really well. Obviously the stretch between 3 to 5 is a tough stretch, but hopefully make a birdie here and there, but you've just got to take advantage of when you do hit the fairways because that's key out here.
Q. Without fans here tomorrow and you being in contention, how do you think that's going to affect everything?
RORY McILROY: It'll feel similar. You know, being only a year out of college, this is what we're used to. J.J., my caddie, was talking, it feels like a member-guest almost because everybody is riding in these empty carts. But it'll be intense. We're out here to win. That's what I want to come out to do tomorrow, and I'm just going to have to focus from hole 1 all the way to 18.
