Q. How would you compare today to yesterday?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   It was pretty similar.  I thought I was hitting it really well when I was in the fairway and wasn't finding the fairway too much.  Made some putts and I've got to keep that up the next few days but I've got to find more fairways if I want to shoot a few more lower scores.
Q. Is there a big change in the golf course today?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   It's still pretty firm.  This morning there wasn't any wind the first nine holes and it was nice, you had to take advantage of that, but it's been good.  It's been good to see a course that's firm and fast.  We love to pray on courses like that.
Q. What do you anticipate for the weekend?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I think I saw a little weather coming in Sunday but for tomorrow still in calm winds, guys are going to keep making birdies.  Even if it gets a little softer, guys are going to be able to play more aggressive and make a few more birdies, as well.
Q. How have your goals changed?  You talked a little about this early in the year, but is it something you write down?  How does it change from obviously success last year and now into the new year?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I wouldn't say it's changed.  I just set new goals.  I talked them out with my coach, Rick, before the new year and just sat down and really had a good conversation on what we want to accomplish this year.  There's a lot going on this year.  There's a lot of events and a lot that I want to play well at.
So it's not like goals have changed.  They just gotten better.  There's more goals out there and hopefully we can check quite a few of them off by the end of 2021.
Q. What's the biggest difference or change you've noticed since your success last year coming into this year, if there is any?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I just have to remember the game I play.  That's the biggest thing.  You know, it's golf.  Every day you're going to wake up a little different and you're going to have to figure out how to play and shoot a good number and that's what I've kind of realized is that nothing is given to us.  We have to come out here and be ready.
