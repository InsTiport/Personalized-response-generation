Q. Certainly a different course this week.  If you could just talk a little bit about the difference between the two weeks.
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, just a completely different course.  Pretty much when your ball lands on the greens and the fairways, everything is running out.  The rough is obviously up, but the greens have gotten a lot quicker, a lot firmer, and when you tuck a few more pin locations a yard closer to the edges of the green, it just makes things a little tougher.  You've got to play smart, and I just didn't play smart.
Q. And the dynamic of being in the same place after winning last week, was there much of a chance for you to let that sink in?  Was there a little bit of a hangover, so to speak, coming into this week?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I thought there was just going to be a lot of momentum.  Obviously there wasn't.  But it's frustrating because I made a lot of birdies last week and made absolutely none this week.  You know, obviously the scores are a lot tougher, but I still had that feeling that I could make a lot of birdies, so sometimes it just gets in my head.
Yeah, out here guys are making bogeys and doubles.  You have to get over it, and just had a tough week.
Q. Will you be able to get home now, and is now the time that you can let the win sink in?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I think the win already sunk in.  I've just got to move on to WGC and get ready for that.  It was a long two weeks.  Obviously when you win, it takes a lot out of you, so I'll get a good amount of rest this next coming week, and we'll be prepped for the next two.
