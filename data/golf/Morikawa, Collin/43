 Q.  Top 10 last week. 9-under par so far this week. How have you found the golf course?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I love it. Obviously conditions have been pretty favorable to everyone, whether it's morning or afternoon. There are some pins out there, a lot of wedge shots that you kind of got to just go after and hopefully make some putts.   
 Q.  Obviously this is a golf course you have played. You moved to Las Vegas and played here. Winning last season, now first full season on the PGA TOUR. How have you decided to prepare for all the new golf courses you'll have to play?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, last week I played, that was my first PGA start as an amateur, and this week obviously I've been able to play the past couple weeks before Safeway.   
But starting next season, and even in the Asia swing, I'm going to be playing these courses that I've never season. I'm just going to have to adjust. That's pretty much what I did the entire summer, and really see the course as quickly as I can and get ready for Thursday.   
Because once Thursday comes, courses change a little bit. Greens get firmer, rough grows, and you got to be a little sharper.   
 Q.  Obviously after the FedExCup playoffs you had some time off. What did you do to prepare for this season?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: A lot of eating. A lot of food. That's really about it. Hung out with my family and my girlfriend. Just really enjoyed the season -- not the season, the time off. Took couple weeks off. Really didn't touch a club.   
It was a long break, but I was ready to get back. When I was at Safeway I was ready to play, ready to get back with the guys out here, especially watching the first couple weeks playing.   
 Q.  Playing this well in a place that you just moved to, I know you played a few practice round with Kevin Na, another Las Vegas guy. How much has the support in this area meant to you?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It's awesome, I mean, finally moving out here and making this home. I made L.A. my home, kind of the Berkeley, San Francisco area, and move out here is really fun. It's a whole 'nother part of my life and I'm looking forward to it.   
Been a fun two days so far. Have a lot of people rooting me on. Yeah, we've got two more days.   
 Q.  I want to ask you specifically about one of the practice rounds you played with Kevin. I think John Oda was there, as well. Kevin gave his version of the story. What exactly played out? Did you maybe take a little money from him?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: No, we ended up tying. I don't know when he said, but he was like 8-under through like a span the six holes. John and I were just grinding out there trying to do our best. We were 2-down with two to go and I stuck it on 17; made birdie. Then John had like a 10-foot putt similar to the pin yesterday. He made it, and we were as happy as could be.   
We were kind of just moseying along through the front nine, the back nine, and we were able to sneak by with a tie.   
 Q.  Cool that you guys have that support out here, Kevin being such a good guy to lean on. You've been playing such consistent golf translating to each golf course. What do you think is the reason for that?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Just sticking to what I've been doing. I think tendencies come and I want to keep hitting cuts, and then I'll see guys hitting draw and I want to try a draw once in a while.   
I just got to remember what I did in college, what brought me to this point is good enough golf game. Obviously I got to tweak some things, refine different parts of my game.   
Other than that, I got to stick to my cuts, stick to what I've been doing. Obviously my ball striking has been the strength, and hopefully get some putts rolling like we did today.
