Q. How would you describe your week this week?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Oh, man, a lot of words.  But I wish I could take back three shots out there that really cost me a lot and cost me a little better finish, if not in contention a little more come Sunday.  Overall it's been a good two weeks in Hawai'i and a lot to move forward on, especially after last fall.  I look forward to the rest of the season.
Q. Seemed like you might have been a little frustrated on the greens.  Is that accurate?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I was hitting the ball really good.  When you give yourself so many chances from 15 feet and in, you want to see more drop and the day they do, we are going to have a really good round but when they are not dropping and you make the 3-footer instead of the 15-footer, you get a little frustrated out there.
Q. What's next for you and anything you want to improve upon?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I'll be playing the OMEGA Dubai, so it will be that, and my next PGA TOUR event to be L.A., the Genesis.  There's a lot to work on.  I've still got to work on my woods.  Still got to work on the driver and 3-wood.  Irons have been good but I've got to keep that up.  The way I'm hitting it now, I want to be able to maintain that, but that's the thing, it's golf.  I have to remember what I did well this week but just move forward.
