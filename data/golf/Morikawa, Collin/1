  Q. Obviously that match went all the way down to the stretch, what were some of the strengths that you had throughout the day?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I mean strengths, I actually putted a few that were really good, short game wasn't great, but overall made some key birdies, obviously had the good eagle on 13 and that kind of kept the round going.
 Q. Do you love match play or do you enjoy this kind of setting?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, no, it's a lot of fun.  It's so different than what we normally play and you only get so many opportunities to play match play, so when you do have it like this week, you really want to take advantage of it.
 Q. Obviously it came down to a tie, what's your mentality going into tomorrow?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I didn't shoot myself out of it, especially after the front nine today, being 2-down.  So I don't know what the match is behind me, but I'm still in it, so I just got to go out and win my next two matches.
