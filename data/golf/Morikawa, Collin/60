Q. What did you think today?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Definitely a different course than Bel-Air.  Conditions were amazing.  Got a little windy out there at the beginning of the round.
You know, didn't make many putts and just kind of hung in there for the day.
Q. Got it to as low as 1-under for the day; is that what it was?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah.  Started off birdie and then kind of get it back, and then I went birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey.  I had chances on 10 and 11.  Just couldn't really make a putt.
If I'm able to make some putts tomorrow it's going to be fun.
Q. We saw you take the driver out on 10.  Is that going to be your game plan in match play as well?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: We'll see.  I look at it as if you hit driver and you hit it bad you can always chip to the front and kind of make par.  Depending who I play and what they do, it's all a game-time decision.
10 is a great hole.  Had a little bit of a wait today, but it's golf.
Q. What's it mean making match play in the home town?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Feels great.  Had to grind it out.  Luckily last few holes are a little more relaxing and didn't have to worry about that too much.
Anything can happen now.  Doesn't matter what you shot.  It's all wiped clean.  We'll just see who I get paired with tomorrow.
Q. Does it matter what seeding you have?  Did you want to get a top 10?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: No.  I could have been the 64th seed and been happy as long as I made it through.
Q. How many times you estimate you've played here?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I played four times before this.
Q. Okay.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: So I've seen the course enough to where I know certain pins and I've seen certain pins in practice rounds out here, but there still some things out here that I need to study and get ready for tomorrow.
Q. Who's your caddie?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: She is my girlfriend, Kathrine Zhu.  She plays at Pepperdine.  Her being there is awesome.
Q. That's cool.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, it's real cool.
