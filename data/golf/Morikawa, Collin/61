Q. Are you happy with 2-under?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, you know, it's a good start, but I had three three-putts coming down the stretch, and I got to fix that if I want to stay in contention.
It's a good start for the tournament.  I can't complain really.
Q. Tell me about a couple of those early birdies.  Really got off to a good start.  You had a good stretch where you birdied 18 and 1 as you made the turn.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, no, I hit a really good shot on 18; only about a foot left.  1 you kind of have to take advantage.  Hit a poor drive, but I was able to make birdie with a two-putt.
I got it going on 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, and just kind of got a little too relaxed.  You just got to stay focused.  It's an 18-hole grind and every shot counts.
Q. What did you hit into 18 and what was your yardage?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Pulled it in the trees; I was 230, so I punched a 2-iron out.  It was a good shot, but at the end of the day made bogey.
Just going to have to work on some things tomorrow and the rest of today and get ready for the rest of the week.
Q. Obviously you've had a pretty good summer leading into this.  What were expectations coming into this Championship?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, you know, it's a long week.  You hope to finish out on top, but you got to worry about the day that's ahead and each shot.
You get ahead of yourself and you think about later on in the week, you know, something might get a little tangled up.
All I'm focused about is tomorrow and making the cut.
Q. Your result in this last year, how much confidence does that give you coming into this year?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, no, I was really happy.  Missed the cut the first time I played in the U.S. Am, and to be back out here, especially in L.A., a little hometown feel, so I feel good this week.
Q. How much would it mean to you to win this Championship in your home state?  Only been done a couple times since World War II.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Yeah, no, that would be amazing.  We don't have too many events out here in L.A.  To be close home is something special.
But like I said, all I' worried about is tomorrow.
Q. Putting these two courses together, I've talked to a few professional players that are jealous of you guys that you have these two courses.  What is it like for you to have these two courses this week?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: We're really lucky.  You know, Bel-Air and Riviera are fantastic courses.  They're kind of different on respect to their own and they provide a challenge for everyone.
I'm not sure what the scores are like, but starting off on 10 wasn't the easiest tee shot out there.  We're lucky to be out here this week.  I think everyone is taking it in.  Just another round, so go out there.
