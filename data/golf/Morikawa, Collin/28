Q. Collin, the expression is Friday trunk slam, but you don't strike me as a trunk slammer type.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: You know, yeah, I had a tough week last week, and coming into this week everything felt good, and just couldn't get the ball in the hole. That's the name of the game, right? So it was bound to happen at some point. Who knows when that was going to be. But now I guess we're going to stop talking about it and I can go and just go on to next week. I'm going to learn a lot from this week. I learned -- I missed the cut as an Am at the Safeway Open in 2016, and I learned more then in those two days than I did in a lot of my events so far as a pro. I'm going to learn a lot from this week and just move forward.
Q. You still seem to have a pretty good career ahead of you.
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Thank you. I hope so.
Q. Your schedule going forward?
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I'm skipping next week. I'm going to play the two in Ohio, and then I'm going to do -- skip 3M, unfortunately. Obviously we played well there last year, but just scheduling, and then I'll be playing St. Jude and the PGA.
