Q. When did you start dreaming about something like this, to be a major champion in golf, and here you are 23 and that's the case today?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   It's amazing.  It's been a life goal, obviously as a little kid, kind of watching everyone grow up, all these professionals, and this is always what I've wanted to do.  I felt very comfortable from the start.  As an amateur, junior golfer, turning professional last year, but to finally close it off and come out here in San Francisco, pretty much my second home where I spent the last four years, is pretty special.
Q. And you had experience here.  We talked to your coach at Cal.  How much of a factor did that play into you having a week like this?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, being able to see the course for about a dozen times, it helped, but it didn't -- you wish it helped a little more, but I still had to read the greens, I still had could am come out here and be prepared to play.  But I guess it helped enough.
Q. We've got to hear about the tee shot at 16 because it reminded us so much of the one you had at Muirfield Village on Sunday at the 14th hole.  Did you channel that at all before you hit it?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I actually did.  14 at Muirfield is pretty special, and my caddie looked at me after I hit my shot on 16 tee and asked me the same exact question.  It just fit my eye.  We were just hoping for a really good bounce, and we got it, hit a really good putt, and now we're here.
