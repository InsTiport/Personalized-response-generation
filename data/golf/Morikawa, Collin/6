Q. Quick assessment on your week, Collin.
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   It was a good way to start 2021.  Obviously I wish I had played a little better today.  I put myself with a good chance but got to learn from it and a lot of positives to take from this week.
Q. Now you take yourself over to Waialae and the Sony Open, completely different golf course and conditions.  How, what do you feel like is the one thing that you have to do there to be successful at Waialae?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I think just taking from this week, I got to hit better approach shots.  Obviously it showed today that I wasn't putting anything close and when I did I wasn't really converting.  So just got to stick out there, wind's going to be I'm sure up just like it was today and just going to have to manage my golf ball.
Q. Is it hard to take your game from here to there because of the different styles of golf courses?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   No, I think that's what we have to do as professional golfers, we travel all over the world adjusting to new grasses, new weather, whatever it may be.  So thankfully I played there last year, I kind of have a good sense of what it's going to be like, but I got to come out fresh and be ready for Thursday.
