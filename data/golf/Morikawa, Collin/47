 Q.  Got off to a solid if not spectacular start.  How important is patience, because from 7 onwards you looked very impressive?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I knew this morning if I got off to a decent start, first two holes if I made birdie on two it was going to be a good day.  And just put myself in a good position to make birdie.   
We had to figure out the distances, like the elevation again.  It's just something you kind of have to adjust for every single day, whether it's hot or a little cooler, the wind.  So just didn't really give myself chances until 7 and start rolling some in.   
I felt good.  I knew there was a lot of birdies on the back and just was able to make a few.   
 Q.  With a 3-footer (indiscernible) and a 4-footer at the end, you've been in contention.  You've learned from those experiences that can help you tomorrow.  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I think tomorrow's another day.  And just stick to what I've been doing, stick to that same game plan and just go out and try and make as many birdies.  It's been the game plan all week from the start, and if I just keep doing that and I just give myself opportunities -- because out here you make a couple birdies you put yourself way up there, someone might catch you.  So it's going to be a full focus for the 18 holes and it's going to be a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Just a few months out of college.  What would a win on the PGA TOUR mean to you?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It would mean everything, especially that I've locked up pretty much my card for next year.  The goal's to get in the playoffs, and the only way to do that is with a win.  I've got this week and next week.   
And through three rounds I've put myself where I want to be and I'm only a few back.  So tomorrow's going to be a great day, and get some rest and get some good food and get ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Good finish today.  Seven birdies.  What was kind of the mindset going into today's round?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: I knew if I just got off to a little better start on the front nine, the front nine hasn't really been too kind to me, especially the first six holes.  So I was able to make a birdie on 2.  Didn't make one until 7, 8, 9, but that's kind of the start for the entire kind of three days so far.   
So I think tomorrow, if I just focus on those first six holes, get off to a good start, make a few birdies, it will be a good day.   
 Q.  Two top 5 finishes you've had in the last month.  What would it mean if you're able to take home and win tomorrow?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: It would be awesome to finally come out here and win.  That would be just kind of a checkmark off one of my goals for the summer.  And I think these next two weeks, this week and Wyndham for next week, it's just trying to win, get in the playoffs, see what I can do.  If not, I've got my card locked up for next year, which is always kind of a good feeling.   
But I want to get in those playoffs.  So it's going to take a lot tomorrow.  It's going to take a really good round.  There's a lot of people around the leaderboard.  Focus one shot at a time, one hole at a time.   
 Q.  How do you stay composed throughout your day tomorrow?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Just remember what has brought me here, hitting certain shots, hitting fades, not getting too aggressive when I don't need to.  But out here, you can get a little more aggressive with the format.  If you do make a bogey, it's only minus one.  Just try to make as many birdies tomorrow.   
 Q.  How do you relax tonight and kind of focus for tomorrow?  
COLLIN MORIKAWA: Just get a good dinner.  Sleep in.  My family flew out last night.  So we'll definitely have a good dinner and just kind of just relax for tomorrow.  Tomorrow is a brand new day.  Wake up and stretch and get ready for the new day.
