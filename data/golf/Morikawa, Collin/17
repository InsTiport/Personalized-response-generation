  Q. Can you describe the first hole?  How did you end up there?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, obviously I was playing for it to be plugged in the right bunker.  Who wouldn't?  No, I mean, I just flared out a 6-iron.  I didn't actually think it was going to fly that far, so when I walked up I was really surprised it was going to be in that lip.
 But if you're going to have it plug in a bunker, you kind of want it on a lip because you can just hit it hard and it's going to pop straight up.  Granted, it's not like I had an easy shot there, and I was really just -- kind of just trying to get it below the hole to the left, five, ten feet for par.
 I hit it, got a great bounce, and from that point it just looked like it was going to go in.  And I just wanted to see the replay.  I finally saw it a few minutes ago.  Yeah, wow, what a shot.
 Q. I'm wondering what it's like when maybe you get some momentum going on the back, putting together a string of birdies, and you look at the scoreboard and it's still -- probably doesn't feel like you're making a dent in the lead.  How hard is it to stay encouraged when that's the case?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I mean, DJ can do what he's doing.  I wasn't focused on what the final score was going to be.  I was struggling at the beginning.  Other than 1, I just couldn't get my ball in the fairway.  Driver was not going straight.
 Yeah, I had it going, but I had to really focus and not let anything go because one bad shot, especially 14, 15, 16, 17, can cost you, and it can add up quick.  I made a good bogey putt on 14 -- yeah, 14 from about four feet.
 You know, today was kind of a grind.  I was able to scrape out a 3-under, but I'm glad I still have somewhat of a chance hopefully tomorrow and see what happens.
 Q. What are kind of your feelings on the model in general of the staggered scoring?
 COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, I mean, I like it.  I don't mind starting at 5-under, or shoot, where DJ was, 10-under.  I don't think anyone would.  It's kind of played out.  You've got to play well.  Even though DJ started at 10, it's not like it was a given that he was going to win.  But he's obviously been playing some pretty good golf, and like I said, we've got a lot of work to do.
 But this is my first time around seeing this, but to finally play some good rounds so far and kind of have somewhat of a shot, I enjoy it.
