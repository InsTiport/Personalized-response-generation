Q. Colin Morikawa, 6-over 76.  Colin, can you take us through your round a little bit.
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I didn't get off to a great start and felt okay until I just made the turn, started making some bad decisions.  That's going to get you out here.  You pick the wrong club, you miss the wrong spot, and you're trying to make 5 instead of 4.  Got a little work to do tomorrow.
Q. How did the course play towards your expectations?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   Yeah, the course was obviously going to be tough.  Fairways started to firm up, and you had to kind of adjust off the tee.  Other than that, there were some gettable pin locations.  I was playing with J.T., and he made a bunch of birdies.  It was doable today.
Q. Did you see a lot of red scores out there?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I thought it was definitely possible.  You just have to hit it really well and pick your spots.  I just didn't do that.
Q. Any adjustments going into tomorrow?
COLLIN MORIKAWA:   I think I just got to be smart.  Obviously, I'm going to need to shoot something in the red.  Game's still feeling okay for what it was for today.
