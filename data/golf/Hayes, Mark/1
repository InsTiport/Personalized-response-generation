Q.  Oak Tree Gang, acquitting themselves pretty nicely out here, tell us about the philosophy of all you guys hanging at this club at Oak Tree here?
MARK HAYES:  Well, I'm not sure who came up with the concept of the Oak Tree Gang.  I guess it's an Oklahoma being kind of a western state, but, anyway, we have been around the same guys seems like they have been around forever.  And that's what they started calling us.  And someone kind of embellished it a little bit, we're really not like that.  We don't wear cowboy hats and boots and that    well sometimes boots, you know, because a lot of us went to Oklahoma State.  But other than that, I'm not quite sure how that kind of evolved like it did.
Q.  What drew all of you, world class golfers, to this particular golf course?
MARK HAYES:  It was Oak Tree and Ernie Vossler and Joe, the founders of the golf course, they had a practice facility that was great and a golf course that we could practice on.  And if you can play here, you can play anywhere.  It has all the shots that you need.  And they treated us great when we were on the TOUR.  They had so many, Landmark had so many facilities all over the country that whenever we played in another tournament, you know, they would put us up and feed us and it was just like being home.  And probably 10 or 15 tournaments each year.

So it was quite a family we had there.
