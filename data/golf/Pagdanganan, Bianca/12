 Q.  Off to a good start on the front nine.  Want to talk about that?  
BIANCA PAGDANGANAN: So my first nine, I played pretty good.  I just gave myself a lot of opportunities to make birdies.  I guess my ball-striking and just my distance control was pretty good, so I was able to manage that.   
 Q.  I know a bogey is not the way you want to finish, but overall, how do you feel about the round?  
BIANCA PAGDANGANAN: I'm actually pretty happy with how I played.  This is a really tough course, tough greens.  I guess staying patient is a huge factor and just waiting for your putts to fall in is just really important thing that I have to keep in mind.  But I'm really happy with how I played.   
 Q.  How do you feel like the course fits your game this week?  
BIANCA PAGDANGANAN: I mean, I'm pretty confident with my drives, and I'm just happy that I'm able to hit fairways and greens, so I guess pretty much my distance was able to help me a lot, especially I feel like I'm hitting it a lot straighter now.  I guess that's a huge advantage that I have as of right now.   
 Q.  And you said it's your first USGA event; were the nerves getting to you when you walked up to the first tee box?  
BIANCA PAGDANGANAN: No, it was more excitement.  I know this is a huge event, and I've been looking forward to playing a USGA event, so pretty glad this is how I kicked it off.   
 Q.  And then you're obviously in a great position going into tomorrow's second round stroke play.  What's your mindset going there?  
BIANCA PAGDANGANAN: Pretty much play the same way I did today, just be patient, hit fairways and greens, just follow my game plan.  Just enjoy every bit of it, and just stay patient and focus on taking it shot by shot.
