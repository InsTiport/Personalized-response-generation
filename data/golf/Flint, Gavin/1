GORDON SIMPSON:  Gavin, that was a wonderful bit of playing today to get yourself in contention.  As we speak you're just one shot off the lead.  Would that have exceeded your expectations at this stage, or did you feel you were playing well coming in?
GAVIN FLINT:  I felt that we exceeded my expectations so far.  I really wanted to put a solid round of golf today after yesterday's efforts, so I was just very happy to do that.
Q.  This is a new experience for you playing where you are, and in such good company, how are you going to approach tomorrow?
GAVIN FLINT:  I really haven't quite worked that out yet.  My nerves have been reasonably good so far, so I to be able to back up my round today was very promising for me.

I'm just going to have wait and see how tomorrow unfolds.
Q.  You had a terrific amateur career, and you've been a professional for two years now?
GAVIN FLINT:  14, 15 months.
Q.  Have you felt that you've been on the verge of something special at one of the bigger events?
GAVIN FLINT:  Honestly I'm still kind of getting accustomed to the bigger events I'd say.  We only played    I think I played six or seven main tour events last year.  So just trying to get used to what happens and being in the presence of some of the guys out here.  Yeah, just trying to play as well as I can.
Q.  You played with Adam Scott as an amateur?
GAVIN FLINT:  That's correct.
Q.  Are you the same age?
GAVIN FLINT:  One year younger.
Q.  Did you play in the World SchoolsÃ¢ï¿½ ¦
GAVIN FLINT:  Yes, I did actually.
Q.  Did you win that?
GAVIN FLINT:  No, we came second that year.
Q.  Do you have much to do with Adam these days?
GAVIN FLINT:  I see him around a little bit.  It's always good to catch up with him, mainly at events.  We spent quite of time together at school.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Is that what you aspire to is to try to elevate your game to the level that he's reached?
GAVIN FLINT:  That's definitely a goal.  What he's done is phenomenal.  So if I can get somewhere close to that, that would be great.
GORDON SIMPSON:  What are your plans for the future, will you be staying here or moving to Europe or the States or try to get your card there?
GAVIN FLINT:  Well, I just went through Asian Tour School and got my Tour card over there.  This is my first official event, really, so I'm looking to play there this year and probably go to the U.S. Tour School at the end of the year.
GORDON SIMPSON:  And what about the golf today, what were the key elements would you say?
GAVIN FLINT:  Pretty much just staying patient and taking the opportunities that I had.  I didn't get off to the greatest start, but I fought through that and played well from about the sixth hole onward.
Q.  What are your strength?
GAVIN FLINT:  I would say my short game, probably my chipping and my putting when I'm playing well.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Thank you.
