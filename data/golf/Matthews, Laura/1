Q.
How did that feel for you today?
LAURA MATTHEWS:  Well, I definitely hit the ball better today, so I'm happy with that.  Didn't score quite as well, a couple of bogeys jumped up there, and then that last hole location was ridiculous.  It's fine.  It's been a great week.  And I'm just happy to have been able to play as well as I did.
Q.  For an amateur to play in this event, were you nervous?  Were you excited?  How would you describe how you felt all week?
LAURA MATTHEWS:  It's a little bit nerve racking on the first tee on the first day.  You kind of shake that off right away.  And then making the cut, that's a little different feeling because you've already accomplished one of your goals in making the cut so then it starts over again with a little bit more nerve racking.  It's been a great week, though, and it's just been fun.
Q.  Your second Canadian Open.  How much do you feel you've improved from last year?  You mentioned you made the cut.  You didn't do that last year.  Do you feel your game has improved that much?
LAURA MATTHEWS:  Yes, definitely.  This year has been a really good year for me, just one disappointing week in the middle of the summer, that's about it.  But other than that, it's been a good year and I feel think my game has improved.
Q.  How do you take what you've done this week to the rest of your season, if you will?
LAURA MATTHEWS:  It's nearing the end of the season, but this is a great experience for the World Amateur.  This is obviously bigger than that.  And to play well here, that's just a boost of confidence...  (end of audio.)
