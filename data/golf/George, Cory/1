 Q. This is your first time in the event. What do you take away from it?
 CORY GEORGE: Well, I want to do it again. I would really like to do it again. Maybe be a little better prepared. I was a little bit nervous with all these people. But today I felt much better. I think the club pros can play with them, I just, we just need to play a little more. 

 Q. I think one of the club pros shot a 4-under today. 
 CORY GEORGE: Great. Great. 

 Q. He's 1-under for the tournament. 
 CORY GEORGE: I'm telling you, I played with him and I think he can play with him, we just sometimes don't get enough practice. 

 Q. Birdies were kind of at a premium. Was there any one area that you thought you struggled in?
 CORY GEORGE: I just got it in the rough a couple times. That's the only thing. I didn't hit enough fairways. Wasn't missing them bad, you just get in there two feet and you're done. 

 Q. Hard to be an Ohio guy playing here in the state?
 CORY GEORGE: Absolutely. Great golf course, great conditions, couldn't ask for anything more.
