 Q.  When did you go back to 14 clubs? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   On the sixth hole.  Sixth hole it was brought out again. 
I have a spare.  I haven't used a spare before, so I had a choice.  He brought two out.  He brought the one that's been repaired and the spare.  But he said the one that's been repaired is not quite set yet, the glue isn't  -- so I got the spare. 
I had to avoid the crowd.  All the crowd was on the left-hand side, and I said, look this is going to break, it had to break.  It did.  It flew straight off left.  I'm lucky it came off the head.  I knew it would just break. 

Q.  Did you see the club  --
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I would have used it at the fourth, yes, but anyway, never mind. 

Q.  Has that happened to you before? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yes, knowing that it's going to happen, yes.  You're so close to the tree that you can't stop the follow-through and that 200-yard shot, you're going to break the club, simple as that. 

Q.  You obviously felt you could execute the shot?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yes, I had hit the shot by the time it was broken.  Just go through it, what the hell.  Disappointing.  I had the last three holes again, but  went out-of-bounds on 17.
