   COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It wasn't easy out there. That was a good 70 out there. Very difficult conditions. I was playing with Richard Sterne and he played okay, but was still four or five over with an eagle. Very, very difficult. Conditions hopefully will remain fair throughout the day as we had it tough this morning. 
 You have to allow yourself the odd mistake and expect it. If you expect things to go wrong it is fine, it is the unexpected things which throw you, as in any walk of life. I made a couple today and had two bogeys which isn't bad. Managed to get four birdies and get out of their alive. Anything around par or under par is a very good round of golf. 

 Q.  Your Dad and Gaynor were out there and what did you talk to them about? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  How slow it was again but poor old Robert Karlsson had a nightmare on the third and broke two clubs. Lost a ball against the tree then did it again with the next club so had to send them back to our van. That was tough. He did very well to make an eight after that.
