  Q. Pretty miserable out there today?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, terrible, because London is lovely and the rest of Britain is not bad. It's a shame because they have great spectators, and it's a shame that the weather is against us really. But no, not to worry. Not to worry.  
  
  Q. The course still holding up?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It is, surprising well. There's a lot of rain right now and a lot of it as you know is sort of below sea level or below Loch level so it's holding up okay.   
  
  Q. What about your own game?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: My own game? Terrible. Two 74s doesn't really hit it, I'm afraid. Give myself some time over the weekend, I'll go to St. Andrews Saturday or Sunday, Sunday probably, and I'll get out to the 9th hole and put and see if I can get something going, because I missed far too many putts. I haven't played very well, either, but missed too many putts, as well. To give myself a chance next week, at least try and do something over the weekend. I'll go there Sunday, just drive over Sunday afternoon.
