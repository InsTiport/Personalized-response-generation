Q.   Do you suffer from the heat?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I think we all do.  I don't tend to suffer as much as some, actually.


Q.   Where do you stand on the shorts or no shorts issue?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I think on the shorts angle, I think we are professional sportsmen; we should be dressed accordingly, and I don't think shorts should be part of the attire, however hot it is.  We can all wear light colored clothing, I think.  If it gets to that stage, we can.  I think, we should be dressed accordingly.


Q.   What is your feeling on the condition of the course this year?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Very good.  Very difficult around the greens because there is a grainy substance around the greens. The grass is very grainy.  It is difficult to chip, but the course overall is very good.  It has held the rain very well.


Q.   How do the greens play?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Good.


Q.   Have you lost a bit of weight?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No.  Do you think I look a bit thinner? Probably shed a few pounds today, but no, I haven't lost any weight.  And, yes, I am trying.  I find it very difficult.  I like my food too much.


Q.   Is it a disadvantage, or are you comfortable the way you are?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I am obviously comfortable.  I am playing the best golf I am playing in my life.  I am not obviously suffering that way.


Q.   You say you play quite well in conditions like this.  Any particular reason why?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yeah, I think I just -- my concentration level goes up.  I think I am challenging golf courses especially U.S. Open type of place where it takes a lot of concentration, and I think my level of concentration is obviously quite high.  That is why I do well, I think.  I am really attuned to this now.  I look forward to challenge with the golf courses, which this is one of.
