COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Played very well today.  3-, 4-irons in on 15, 16, 17 that were as good as I can do.  Nice to birdie one of them.  Come in, and, hey, a chance here.  Got a real chance here.   
 Q.  Wind was the opposite, wasn't it?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Horrendous.  Just as we turned for home it got horrendous.  The ninth green, it just turned and we thought, oh, bugger it, you know.  I missed a couple of short putts on 11 and 13 for pars.  I could have done with them.  But at the same time, you know, hey, you never know.  Off to a flyer tomorrow.  You never know.   
 Q.  To finish how you did on those last three holes, you must be really encouraged?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Very encouraged, 15, 16, 17, 18, to play them in 1-under today, that's good, very good.   
 Q.  Conditions pretty much the same for tomorrow?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I think so.  We'll see.  We'll see.  It's just a matter of trying to get off to a good start.  I was only 1-under at the turn, and it wasn't enough.  You need it in hand.  You need the credit because you're going to withdraw on the back nine.
