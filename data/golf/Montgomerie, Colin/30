  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I didn't play very well today.  A couple of mistakes late, on 12 and 13, the bogey there.  But still in there.  Still in there with a chance, you know.  It was very difficult.  No one's run away with it.   Q.  What happened on those couple holes?  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Just missing the fairways.  I didn't hit the fairways enough.  You don't hit the fairways, you're not going to score.  Disappointing on the 12th and 13th, but got it back together.  The last five holes, I played much better and could have had a couple birdies coming in.   Q.  You're right there.  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: One shot back.   Q.  Where you were last year?  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I was four shots back last year.  One shot back today.   Q.  Was there a difference with the weather change a little bit today?  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It was more breezy.  I had to think more.  I think it was the most difficult day out there today because of the breeze more than anything, yeah.   Q.  What was those last five holes, what actually worked for you?  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I just started to complete my backswing, trying to get some rhythm, you know.
