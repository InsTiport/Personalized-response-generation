   COLIN MONTGOMERIE: As I always said, these matches are so close, even the record wins that Europe have had over the last sort of four times, these matches are so, so close, and it comes down to the last hole, you know, five out of seven have gone their way, or you know, you say, and it's unfortunate, but it's just the way these things golf.  
 We need, minimum, 4-2 out of this session. There's two foursomes out there and four fourballs. We must get into the singles 8-all, minimum. If we can get into this 8-all, God, what a day we have got ahead of us tomorrow afternoon.  
  
  Q. What sort of things are you saying to your players?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I'm just telling them how good they are. That's all I can do. I can do only that much to tell them how good they are, the motivational tapes are on in the lounges when they come in, they see themselves lifting trophies, they see themselves holing putts, so that's all we can do. That's all I can do is give them passion.   
 Their motivation is there, as I've said all week, by losing this thing two years ago, the motivation is there, now it's all about passion here, and want, and they have got to want this and by God, they do.
