   COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  You read my card on the back and it's, 5, 6, 2, 5, 6, 2.  It's a phone number.  5, 6, 2, 5, 6, 2, 5, 2, 4. 

 Q.  Who's number is it then? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I wish I knew.  A good round, I suppose.  Don't ask me how. 

 Q.  When you see 2 leading, 1 over is a decent score? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: When 2 is leading 1 over is okay.  There's nothing wrong with that.  We'll see how we go.  It's not easy out there.  You have to hit the fairways and the rough is very severe.  I tend to -- I'm more accurate than most and what happens is that if I'm going to miss a fairway, it just runs in, you know, into a sore spot and you get heavily penalized, and you can't do that. 
 I only hit two fairways the back nine, and I'm lucky to come out 2 over having holed the second shot, two 2s and a second shot, and it's two ore.  We'll try to hit more fairways tomorrow. 

 Q.  Three 2s in nine holes does impress. 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I've gotten a lot of 2s over the years.  There are thousands and thousands of 2s, not too many for eagles though. This one on 17 was a seven iron from 156 yards. 

 Q.  I have seen you hit every number, even an 8. 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Thank you.  Can we drop the 8?  You've seen the hole-in-one? 

 Q.  Yes.  This is the first eagle. 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Good!
