Q.  Colin, well done.  You do like to make it dramatic.  How uncomfortable was that coming down 18?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Well, it was.  I had it in the bag.  I thought my putt was in at 16.  All credit to him, he birdied 17.

Coming down the last, he hit a great shot in there.  I felt I couldn't make it, so I erred in the bunker.  We were about the same length, and David went for it and made it.  I thought all I could see is water behind, and I heard all kinds of horror stories.  I'm getting used those putts the last couple greens.  David just said, "Let's hope we have another game in Louisville in two years' time."
Q.  You'll miss these when they're over, won't you?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I will.  I'll miss them greatly.  That's eight now and hopefully I can qualify for nine.

It's looking good right now because the matches are not just 1 up, it's actually 2  and 3 up.

And the crowds, they've been absolutely superb.  That first tee that first day, if you were shaking at all, there's no way you would have hit a golf ball off that tee.
