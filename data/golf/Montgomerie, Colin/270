COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Started 5,5 so did well to score two under from there.
Q. Not often you get hugs from supermodels.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I have been getting hugs from supermodels for the last three days. I've had a huggy week.
Q.  How is your form?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Starting to play actually quite well. Changed my backswing, changed the path of my backswing and it is much, much better. Starting to fade the ball again for the first time in three years. I can do it again as my back is better. I'm confident for the next few weeks. I am playing Madrid and Valderrama.  So, confident to do well in both of them.  Confident for tomorrow, as well.

I am beginning to come through the ball again now the backswing is better. But everything is okay.
Q.  No more hugs tomorrow, though?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I hope not because I am playing with Vijay.
