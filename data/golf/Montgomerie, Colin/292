COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   A bit stiff, yeah, I don't know why it should be, but never mind.  I'll go to the physio and see what's what.  A little bit stiff, but nothing untoward. 

I was doing well, but not to worry.


Q.  Anywhere in particular it was hurting?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   No, no.  No, I just eagled 11 and I hit a good shot out of the bunker there with a 3-wood and a good shot there.  I birdied which was good to get to 3-under. 

It's a difficult finish, obviously.  I bogeyed 15 and 17.  I put it in the hedge at 17 so that wasn't very good.  Decent 2-putt at the last there, so that's okay.  I'll rest tonight and come out in the morning no problem at all.


Q.  How good was 64? 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   64 was very good.  So was 60 when he played it the last time.  Long way to go, mind you.  You can only lose it today. 


Q.  Pop any painkillers? 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   No, no.  The course is playing well, though.  We'll see if we don't need placing tomorrow which would be good, I suppose.  We never like placing our ball.  It's okay. 

Everything is all right.  Everything is intact.  Top six.  It's exactly where I want to be, not seven behind but decent place.
