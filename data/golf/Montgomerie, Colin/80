  Q. You must be very, very pleased.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yes, very pleased. I don't know, how the putt missed at the last, my God, but it did and managed to get some birdies coming in. Played well. Drove the ball well.   
 I led the stats in driving accuracy this week and I told you, if I can do that, I can play and I can compete then and I can contend, which is key. So we'll just see how it goes, yeah, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow now, looking forward to trying to find a caddie and trying to compete and contend to get in the U.S. Open now.   
  
  Q. Are you close to getting a caddie?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I'm sort of working on it. No, not really. I'm borrowing Peter Lawrie's caddie, he's having a baby -- well, his wife is and he's having paternity leave, so he has two weeks off. So I'm going to borrow him, Brian Martin. So I'm going to call him and find out what time we want to meet up tomorrow morning. It's borrowing right now from people that are not playing.  
  
  Q. For Wales, as well?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Hopefully for Wales, yes.  
  
  Q. This must give you more satisfaction in a tournament for a long time?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Very much. So this has given me lots of satisfaction, especially around here, big tournament, you know what I mean. It's good.   
  
  Q. Same jumper?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: This is the only one I've got actually so I've decided to wear it, every day. Yesterday was a need but today I decided, look, I'll wear it again.   
  
  Q. Different shirt?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Different shirt, you'll be glad to know.   
  
  Q. Shows you how observant.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I'll leave you to it; write about Westwood, I think he's going to it win here. He's very, very strong when he's in the lead and best of luck to him.
