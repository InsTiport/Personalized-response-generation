COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  (66, 206 total.)  I drove the ball very well, long and straight today, and that was the big difference.  At the 16th, I had a 3-iron second shot over the back, and only 91 yards to the flag on 18.  It's a huge difference if you're driving it a long way.   There's no other reason.  I was just confident and hitting harder and straighter.  The greens and fairways were firmer today, and the ball tends to run off them when they are like that.   It was nice to have shot that score.  66 has a nice ring to it.  Certainly better than 76.  It's a pleasure, a real pleasure to play in these conditions.  There's a buzz on every tee, and people saying things like, "It can't be him, can it?"  That's nice.  I've struggled to compete over the last few weeks, but this has helped, and I'm looking forward to returning here in the future.  I think what's happened with the galleries has held me back in the past.  When you stand on the first tee feeling uncomfortable, it's not good. I'm a bit far behind now, even to shoot for second place, but it would be nice to get a decent score and to finish feeling confident.  I am confident going out tomorrow.  I don't really intend playing more here next year.  I'm happy with eight or nine tournaments, and 15 or 16 in Europe, and some other world events to make up 30 a year.  That's what I've done for the last ten years, and it has not hurt me.  It's now becoming a pleasure to play over here, which is a delight.  That's my lowest round over here for a long time.  Now I'm looking forward to going to Germany and defending the BMW International Open next week.  That's my immediate goal, along with trying to shoot a decent score tomorrow.
