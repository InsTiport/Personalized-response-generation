Q. Thoughts on your round?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  A very difficult day, very difficult day.
Q. Was there a moment on the 15th green when you thought "oh no"?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes, sure. Oh no, if it had blown the other way it was in the ocean. At least it blew towards the hole. Then I wasn't quite concentrating on what I was doing and I missed the putt.
Q. And you were pretty confident that you had done nothing wrong?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes, sure. I called the rules official and he told me it was okay.

Never mind. It was a difficult day -- I have a lot to make up tomorrow.
Q. Kenneth Ferrie snuck in at The K Club. He will not be able to do that tomorrow?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No, he will not sneak in tomorrow but he is playing the best course today with the weather conditions.
Q. But the way you played the Old Course yesterday, you could do with a repeat tomorrow?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I need more than that, though, I am five behind already.
