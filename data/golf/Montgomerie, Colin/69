Q.   3‑under for the first round, good start? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It is.   I played okay.   I didn't make a bogey, but we made a double at the 12th, which was crazy, just unfortunate, and I actually got up‑and‑down for a bogey.   I double‑bogeyed 6 and then had five birdies and a double, so that's okay.   Everything's okay. 
I'm a little bit behind him off the tee, but he's more than half my age, less than half my age.   But at the same time, that's okay.   Start of the year, that's okay.   I've got a bit to work on obviously.   My driver, a bit to work on. 
But first round of golf with a brand new set of clubs and brand new ball, and brand new body, because it's heavier than it was, and it's not too shabby.   A bag of clubs that's brand new, and that's okay.
