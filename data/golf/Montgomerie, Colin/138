   COLIN MONTGOMERIE: That was a good start. I played okay in practice and I had a few chances out there as well which slipped by - 11, 12, 13 and didn't go in. That was decent. It shows it's still there. I shot 67 in the last round in Dubai and 67 in the first round here so things are looking up. I'll get back in the top 100 I think at this rate. It's a start - a move in the right direction. We'll see what happens over the next few rounds but that's a half decent start.  
The wind swirled a bit and it will be hot tomorrow but an early start is good. We're second off and looking forward to it tomorrow. I took a headache pill around the turn because of the heat. I was once told if you have a headache it's too late so in this heat I take one around the turn anyway before I have one. I know it's going to happen and I try to beat it.  
 My caddie, Matt (Harbour), was super today. Nice lad and Thomas (BjÃ¶rn) isn't here so I was able to 'borrow' Matt. My own caddie, Jason (Hempleman), is on paternity leave. His wife has had a baby and it's just a shame this is so far away. If it had been in England he'd probably have attended. Australia is a long way to come.  
 It's been a busy time and it will be busier as we go forward. I try to relax on the golf course away from all the stuff that goes on. The word 'Ryder Cup' is mentioned a lot at home and abroad and there is an awful lot of work to be done. So it started the day it was announced. Exciting at the same time and I am enjoying it. I look forward to every moment of it.
