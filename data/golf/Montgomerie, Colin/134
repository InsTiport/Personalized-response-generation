  Q. Do you feel tired at all?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Very, yes, but I just want to concentrate on Europe. I'm 97th in The Race to Dubai; I want to concentrate on Europe.  
  
  Q. 36 holes on Monday wouldn't have gone down well, would it?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Would have done fine, but whether I would have made the cut in America or not, I'm just glad that I made the decision I made.   
  
  Q. Through 12 holes today, you played well.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yes, and then I made a couple of mistakes coming in but it's quite difficult.   
 It's a long course, and I just have to get my way around and find my way around the course, but the tournament is okay. 31 is not great but a lot of improvement.  
  
  Q. What was your first professional round on the Tour?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: 76 around Switzerland, which felt like 96.
