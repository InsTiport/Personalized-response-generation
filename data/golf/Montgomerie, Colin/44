Q. Colin, you told us at the beginning of the week one of your lifelong goals was to win a USGA event.  Now that you've gotten it done, how would you describe your emotions?COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Dear, dear.  That's the third USGA playoff I've been in and 3rd time lucky, I suppose, two against Ernie and this here, fantastic.  All credit to Gene Sauers brilliant play yesterday and held on today coming in.  I did as well. This is a great, great golf course, very, very difficult and if anybody thinks these Senior Majors are easy to win, believe me, come out here and try it, believe me, because it's a great standard of golf out. Just a hair's breath short of the PGA Tour.  It's fantastic to finally win a USGA event.  The U.S. PGA event a month previous.  It's been a great summer.Q. Congratulations, Colin.COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Thank you very much
