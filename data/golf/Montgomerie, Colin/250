COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I did well on the back nine. I was one over after seven and not going anywhere so that was good from there. That was 72 turned into 68 and I made a bogey on the last hole but I birdied 15, 16 and 17, which was fine. 68's okay. Safe. Nothing to report. That's it then, isn't it? No problems at all.
