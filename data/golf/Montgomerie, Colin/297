 Q.  So a disappointing week? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yeah, disappointing.  Just a fraction off. 

Q.  Last few holes yesterday were disappointing, and today you had chances at 16, 17 but missed them both?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Thank God I got the last, but disappointing.  Disappointing after a difficult start with the caddie situation.  But at the same time all credit to Andy for coming out and trying to win.  It's nothing personal with Andy.  He's a great, great guy and I feel sorry for him in a way, in a big way.  But that's the way things go sometimes.  Got to keep going forward. 
Obviously trying win now, playing okay but just not good enough.  We'll see what happens next week and the U.S. Open. 

Q.  Was it difficult with your caddie for four days? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It could have been if he made it that way, but he didn't.  It would have been difficult if he played it that way, but he didn't, so all credit to him.

Q.  Did his job professionally?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Did his job professionally.
 We shook hands after the first round and everything.  There's nothing like that at all.  He was professional till the end which was very, very big of him.  He won't have any trouble getting another bag.  I wish him all the success. 

Q.  Why do you feel sorry for him?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Because he's a lovely guy and a very good caddie. 

Q.  What do you look forward to now?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I look forward to winning. 

Q.  What do you need?  What's missing in your game?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It's almost there.  It's very, very close.  Just not close enough.  11-under, there's nothing wrong with the game, I averaged 69 and that sort of thing, but it's just not quite good enough.  Just a few putts from about four foot and six yesterday and then the bounce at 17 on the first day and there's four shots for a start.  You're 11-under, or you're 15 and suddenly you're battling around.  It's just little things that add up, I'm afraid. 

Q.  When will you go to the U.S. Open?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I'll go earlier, and then I'll play in the Scottish PGA, which I haven't done in a long time as well.  A good time coming up.
