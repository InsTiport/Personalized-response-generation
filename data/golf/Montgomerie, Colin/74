  Q. Were at the top of the leaderboard?  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, it was going well and then I sort of ran out of puff when I hit it left on the 11th and got an impossible, impossible lie, twice, and that ball stopped at the top and then it came down into; again, an impossible lie and made double there, and then bogeyed 13, 14. Managed to birdie 15, 16, 17, but it was too little, too late, finished 29th again. Not good.   
  
  Q. Did you think it was going to be too difficult --  
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, it was, it was always too soon, too short. So there you go. So a week off next week, I've played three in a row. I've got to get down to The Open anyway, I have something to present on Tuesday night at your dinner and then just come home.   
 I'm just driving home now, 2 1/2 hours in the car and it will sink in then.  
  
  Q. Do you think you'll still have a run next year?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, we'll start again, that's all we've got.   
  
  Q. Must be encouraged the last few weeks compared to a month ago.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It's much better. It's just disappointing. You get in a position to do well and you finish 29th again, you know, it's into good, 29th. Doesn't really do anything for anybody.
