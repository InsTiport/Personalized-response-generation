COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Sorry I was late there.  I was reading a transcript of George O'Grady, who had spoken to you I believe around about 12 o'clock, so I know exactly what he said.  And I agree entirely with everything that he said and has said, and exactly everything that he said about our European Tour Committee of which I am part of, elected by the players.  And I agree entirely with what he's saying and entirely with what he said.

And there's no, really, very little else that I can say.  He has hit it in a very professional    stated in a very professional manner.
Q.  So it's not necessary to go into it; he said what he said?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Not at all.
Q.  Will you speak to Gary Evans?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No, I won't speak to Gary Evans, no.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion; as you are, you have an opinion, as well, and that's what you're paid to do, you give an opinion.  As he's not paid to give an opinion, but he has an opinion and that's an opinion.
Q.  Are you surprised by Gary's comments?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes, I am very surprised, as George O'Grady is, as our European Tour Committee are, and I'm sure as you are.  And I am as well, very surprised.
Q.  Were you aware that Gary had sort of been suggesting this for a few weeks now?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No, I wasn't aware of it, no, surprised.  I'm only glad that I was able to score 66 today in very difficult circumstances.
Q.  When did you know about it, Colin?  Did you read it this morning?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I was told last night.
Q.  What was your reaction when you were told?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Very hurt.  Yes, I am hurt.  Just very glad that I was able to do what I did today on the golf course and go out and prove to myself and everyone else that I can still do this and do what I do best.  I was 5 under after eight holes today, and that was a good effort.
Q.  Wouldn't you have thought this issue was dead and buried?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I thought it was.  I thought it was when a statement came out from The European Tour Committee at the Forest of Arden.  We all thought it was.  We're all disappointed at what's happened here, including myself.
Q.  So should Gary be fined for what he said or should he apologize?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  That's not my decision at all.  That's George O'Grady's.
