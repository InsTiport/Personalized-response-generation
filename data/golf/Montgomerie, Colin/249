COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Early on I was more worried about missing the cut but then I birdied three holes coming in to get me to 6-under, and that's okay. If Darren Clarke putts the way he did today this tournament's his. 22 putts today and that's exceptional. 22 putts is absolutely phenomenal and he didn't look as if he was going to miss. If he keeps on doing that, not just this week; he will do very well next week. It didn't look that way early on. He had an 'unquestionable' the second shot of the day. I was very impressed with his putting. Very impressed and if he does that again he will not just win this but do very well next week too.

The support was encouraging. It's very nice to play here. It helps in all sorts of ways. It gives you a little more self-esteem and confidence and it's super to play here in Scotland and I look forward to the weekend here with big crowds and to the four days next week as well.

It's benign today. Nothing much happening, but it doesn't matter if it blows of not. A putting contest? Yes, you hit the greens here and the fairways are generous and the greens are soft so the scoring will be low.

Alastair Forsyth's 64 today was very good. It's nice to see Scots there because I am the only  one in the top 100 and that's not enough, so it's about time we had more in the top 100, not just one. That's the worst we've been for a while. If ever, since the World Ranking came out and it's about time we got more in.
