COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I didn't putt well today.  I left about four shots out there, four or five shots that should have gone on, and obviously didn't.  And that's the difference between +1 and a  3, which should have been fine.  I played well enough to score  3.  I couldn't get the ball in the hole, unfortunately.  The greens were slower today.  I didn't quite get the pace of the greens, I didn't quite hit the ball hard enough on the greens.  We'll have a session out here and get things going for tomorrow.  But I hit the ball okay, not getting the ball in the hole.
Q.  How frustrating is that given the amount of putting practice you've done?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Very, very, very.
Q.  Will you change the putter?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No, not necessarily.  It's the puttee (sic), me being the puttee.
Q.  Is that a missed opportunity to shoot a low score?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Sure.  Yes, it was scorable today, this morning.  And I didn't score, unfortunately, and now I have a bit of hard work to try to get 66 or something tomorrow to get myself back into it.
