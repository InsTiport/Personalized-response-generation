COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It was difficult today.  The pins were in difficult positions and we are all in a rush to get through before the weather hits.  I made a bad start again.  I've played the second hole in 5, 5, 5, 6; so I've probably lost about four shots to the field.  So that's disappointing on that one hole.  The rest of my game is fine.  I'm driving is well, and to finish fourth in a field of this quality is a good performance.  I've picked up a few more World Ranking points, a few more dollars in the bank and that's about what it is. 

Q.  How would you feel about if you had to qualify for the European team at the BMW next week? 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I've never been in that position, thank God, and I mean that. 

Q.  What would you do if you were Paul McGinley? 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Well, if it was mathematically possible that someone could pass me and get on to the team by a matter of 50 pounds or something, then I would play.  I think you have to cover your options, and if I was asked, that's what I would tell Paul.
