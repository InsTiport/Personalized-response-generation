LES UNGER: We have Colin Montgomerie who was at the dias a
couple of years ago at Pebble Beach when positive things were
in the wind until Mr. Kite got going late and from the standpoint
of today, it has been a brutal day out there, I would imagine.
We would like to hear about your round. I know you are not too
happy about the last hole. Did you think it was a good round overall.

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, on the first tee you got to accept 71.
That's what I did. Usually being a 3-under with four holes to
go, you finish even; that is not so clever. But you got to accept
what you get, what you give, and 71 was a good score after that.

LES UNGER: Questions, please. Some of you are new. There are
people with microphones here so everyone can hear the question.
Raise your hand; a mic will get to you.


Q. Colin, just how did you suffer in the heat? Can you say
what happened the other day after your practice round?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Sorry?

Q. How are you suffering in the heat?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I think we all are. I mean, I am no different
from anyone else. My caddie is lying down in the locker room right
now. He is not so well. I'm almost at that stage too. I have a
throbbing headache, and very difficult when you line up a putt
and all the blood rushes to your head and you got to try and concentrate
through it and it is hard enough without 97 degrees or something,
but you got to put up with it. It is very difficult to concentrate
because the play is very slow out there. It is five hours and
something and it is very difficult to concentrate for that length
of time in that heat. Because if you don't, if you lose concentration,
you are looking at a double bogey or plus. That is a big problem.


Q. Colin, we heard you weren't well Tuesday or yesterday?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, I was in the medical trailer Tuesday
after I finished. They gave me an I.V. thing; filled me up with
fluid. I lost too much on Tuesday, and that is the worst in a
major championship, yes, certainly. I am looking forward to Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

LES UNGER: You wouldn't mind if it got cooler, would you.

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: No, not at all.

Q. What exactly happened on 15?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I just missed the fairway and I chipped out
sideways; hit an 8-iron too big through the back. That is a no-go
area, and I got up and down for 6 less. My hands are swelling
up. The grip on my driver feels a lot thinner than it should,
so I am pulling the ball left. I don't know what we are going
to have to do.

Q. Have you weighed yourself? 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: No.

Q. Just for loss of fluid or how much you are drinking out
there?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I have to drink at every hole, but I don't
know what is happening to you, so obviously losing a lot.

LES UNGER: You didn't get on the scale in the locker room;
did you?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Sorry.

LES UNGER: Did you get on the scale in the locker room after
playing?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: No. Not at all.

LES UNGER: We appreciate you being here. Thank you.

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Thank you.
