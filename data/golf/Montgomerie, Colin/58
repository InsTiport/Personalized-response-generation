  COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   My putting was awful.   My play was awful.   So got a lot to think about when I go away from here.   17 shots behind Bernhard Langer is no use at all.   So a lot to think about and I'll get it right next time. 

Q.   What sort of things do you need to think about? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Everything.   Everything.   Yeah, the standard out here is very good and I'm delighted that it is, very, very good, the standard; I'm delighted it is, because it means when you do well, you know it's meaningful.   But I've got a lot to do and a lot to work on and I'm going away to do it right now.
