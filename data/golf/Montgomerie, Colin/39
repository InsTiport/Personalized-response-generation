  COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   If I can drive the ball well, I can get around.   I have to put the ball in the fairway.   My length around here, I'm afraid, is not long enough but as long as I hit the fairways, I was okay, and I did that today. 

Q.   How long was the last putt? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Miles.   30 foot, 25 foot. 

Q.   In 2000 when you played here‑‑
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   That's 14 years ago.   I don't remember much. 

Q.   How much do you remember‑‑
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It's much, much further right now.   I think I've gained about four percent on a course that's 20percent.   So you're shorter and hitting longer shots in to tight pin placements.
On the Champions Tour, I've played there a year and a bit now, and the pins are not located in the corners that they are here.   This is real corner stuff.   The green keeper did quite well sometimes to put the pin on the green, find the green, amazing.

Q.   First major in four years now, how is it to get in one? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Well, it's great.   To be in one is one thing.   I know, one, to represent the Champions Tour well, really, and 70 is okay to start with.   You are representing the Senior Tour, because of my exemption here was because I won the US PGA Senior, so you feel you're representing that and you have some sort of duty to perform almost.   So I'm glad I've done that after one day.   Obviously there's a long way to go but at the same time it's a reasonable start.
