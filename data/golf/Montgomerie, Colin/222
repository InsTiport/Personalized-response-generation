GORDON SIMPSON:  Colin, could you just give us the assessment of the position at the end of play today?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yeah, well, tied for the lead, nothing much to be said.  I think Sergio is coming in later on, so he can tell you more about what's going on that I can.  I have an agenda here, I just have an agenda, to beat 53 other guys out here today and I'm doing my job fine.  And I'm proud of what I'm doing right now, very proud of what I'm doing, to go out there leading again, score under par was a very good effort and I'm proud of what I'm doing out here.  As I said yesterday, this isn't easy, and it's proving it, and it will be an exciting day tomorrow.
Q.  Although you say you have one agenda, which is to win the Order of Merit, but a win tomorrow night would put you back into the world Top 10.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  That's fine, that's fine.  Talk about that if and when it happens tomorrow.
Q.  Was your start better today than the other two; you were almost perfect the first five.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I played well, better on the front nine than the back nine.  I managed to get it around 1 over in the back nine, even with the 17th and was proud of that.

So that's fine.  Nothing wrong with the game or anything.  It's just that Sergio had a great finish and best of luck to him and we'll go for it tomorrow.
Q.  Can you tell us what happened on the 17th?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I just hit my shot a bit heavy unfortunately.
Q.  What was the yardage?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  You don't want to know the yardage.
