COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I had three 6's on the back nine, my front nine.  It's par 37, but the par 5s, I took 6, anyway, never mind, that was me, 5 over, that wasn't very good.

I was out in 42 and back in 32 which was much, much better to give myself a chance of scoring 66 tomorrow and making the cut, because the scoring is very easy, really.
Q.  Any reason why the game was off?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yeah, everything on the front nine, but it just didn't work.  I was missing sand wedges and missing short putts and didn't happen.
Q.  Inaudible?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I got here Wednesday morning    yesterday morning, so I haven't even been here a day.
Q.  You said you had not played?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  No, I had not played at all.  A little rusty possibly but that's okay.  I need to get going, so that's fine.
