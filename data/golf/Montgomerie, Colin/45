 Q.  You moved into first in the Schwab Cup now.  COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Oh, really?  Okay.  Well, for the Champions Tour, that's super to be that way.  As I say, any time I'm up or near the lead with Bernhard Langer I'm delighted. I know it's double points in these majors, so it counts.  He's won one and I've won a couple.  We'll have a battle royale coming in the last few months of tour, but I look forward to it.  He's a great champion. As I say, the Champions Tour has made me so welcome out here.  Senior golf has been a real delight.  I'm enjoying myself thoroughly.
