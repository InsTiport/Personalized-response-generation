Q.  Could be an unusual day if the team qualifies for tomorrow?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I don't think that is going to be the case because it goes on the pro score and goes up to 27th and top 20 so I will not be playing and neither will Michael. And Michael is speaking at the Oxford Union so.
Q.  Is that a relief for yourself?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes.
Q.  Tough day out there?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It was and I got cold and tired. The season's winding down and it wound down today.
