Q.  You're renowned for your long game; wonderful up and down on the last?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It was, wasn't it.  I was lucky.  I pulled it left, the ball had mud on it, and I hooked it.  Anyway, I managed to get a good drop in the drop zone, I was walking to the drop zone, I chipped in on the 9th, marvelous chip, and up and down on the last to tie Harrington and that's good.

I just heard that David's dropped a shot, so tied for the lead.  I've won here before and I look forward to playing tomorrow.
Q.  Haven't won this calendar year, could this be the week?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Well, opportunity, isn't it, you know, and I would like to win.  It won't change my life if I don't but at the same time, I'd like to win and going into the Ryder Cup with added confidence I suppose.  Whatever happens I've got my game back in shape, I'm putting better much better.  When I'm driving the ball long and straight, I have a chance most weeks, and this is one of them.
