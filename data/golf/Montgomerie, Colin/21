COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It was tough to get the club selection correct.  So anything on par or better today was a very good round of golf.  I was happy with 3-under, it's one of the best scores of the leading pack.   
And obviously this tournament means an awful lot to me, obviously this championship does.  It was my first 72-hole stroke play win here in America two years ago.  And having managed to defend last year, its great to come back here and talk of winning three times in a row.   
So, I put myself in a reasonable position and that's what I wanted to do Saturday night was to get into contention and I'm that.  So, we'll just see how tomorrow goes.  Be nervy.  Obviously, it's who holes the 7-, 8-footers.  It's a good iron shot in to 7, 8 foot and it's also a reasonable chip and sometimes it's a good first putt, 7, 8 foot.  It's the ones that are going to win this that are going to hole them tomorrow.  So, that's key.
