  Q.  Your thoughts on the match?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Well it's simple, isn't it, putting. I just putted...  I had chances on ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 and missed them all. You can't do that and expect to win.   
  
  Q. Plus Stewart finished very strongly?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Well he did and he putted well, putted very well. He even said he got lucky on a few of his putts and I was unlucky. That's it.
