 Q. Stevie was saying you struck the ball as well today?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I did yes. I had a couple of missed putts and a couple of untoward shots but overall pretty good. I had a good up and down from the bunker at the last though (holing from eight feet for par), because that was a good shot I hit in at the last and it just caught the wind. It is a lot breezier now which has made it a lot more difficult in the afternoon than it was this morning. I think anything under par this afternoon is a good score. This morning it was flat calm, this is much more difficult.



Q. Frustrating then not to be under par today yourself?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yes it is really. I played just as well today as I did yesterday if not better and I certainly drove the ball better. I was just a little unfortunate that my approaches ended up at the wrong side of the pins and so on. But however, that's the way it goes and there were no disasters.



Q. You are still in sight of the leaders though?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well I know. And the last six holes now are not easy at all so we are doing okay. I'm still in a good position.
