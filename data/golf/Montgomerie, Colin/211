Q.  When was the last time you had a singles match that lasted five and a quarter hours?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It was very slow, indeed.  We waited for every shot.  In match play you expect a run around.  And of course even on extra holes we caught up with the last group.  And of course, you can't blame them for being slow.

But anyway, I had loads of chances.  I was 4 up.  He got it back.  He did well.  I didn't play very well.  He got it back and I threw it away, I thought.  I was 1 down with three to go.  And then I managed to
Q.  You had a chance to win it in the rough, it looked great?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I don't know how that putt missed yet.  He had a chance at the first.  I had a chance at the second.  He had a chance at the third.  I had a chance at the fourth.  So anyway, I managed to scrape him.
Q.  It wasn't a pleasant start?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Look at any game; it's not easy.  There's no game a gift.  There's no game easy at all.  It's very, very difficult out here.  Every game, your mind is right on it.
Q.  Even when you're 4 up?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Even when you're 4 up, of course you are.  He won 8 & 9, 2 up and suddenly, bingo, different ballgame, you notice.  But anyway, I did okay.  I got Ryder Cup points, World Cup points, and it gets me back into having missed the last two cuts in Europe.  It was important that I won that match.
