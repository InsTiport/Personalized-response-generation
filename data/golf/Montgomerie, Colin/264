Q.
Talk about the your round.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I didn't putt very well and that was it, really.  I missed 3 short putts and that was key.
Q.  Do you think about what this does for the transition into the next season?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It's good for me to compete again, because I haven't competed in a long time.  I didn't win today, but I will next year.
Q.  Thoughts about the course overall?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It's great.
