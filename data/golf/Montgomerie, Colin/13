 Q.  So just sitting around all day, how did you spend your day?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Got something to eat.  We sat and watched the Liverpool/Arsenal game.  It was on.  The EPL was on, the English Premiere League.  That was fine.  We were ready to go, and, unfortunately, the course conditions are obviously unsuitable.  So they decided to call it off and we'll all come back, unfortunately.   
The main thing is here is hotel rooms, flights, all the stuff that you have to redo, the cost involved in changing flights, changing hotel rooms.  That's the main issue here, not the golf.  And the course couldn't take -- no course could take that amount of water.   
So that's the main issue is the cost involved.  But not just for myself, but for everybody here, yeah.   
 Q.  The Liverpool/Arsenal game ended up a good game, right?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: That was a great game, 4-3 to Liverpool.  Supporting Liverpool, great, fine.  But it's -- yeah, it's just disappointing, isn't it, that this tournament, as we know, should have been in June where the weather is normally not as humid.  Excess humidity causes this in August, and it's unfortunate.  But, hey, we'll come back tomorrow.   
 Q.  And you go a full day without playing.  How do you stay mentally --  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Oh, that's okay.  Christ, I go three months without playing.  Don't you worry about this.  A day's fine.  A day off's fine.  I'll just go to the mall this afternoon, have a look around, and get ready for the first tee shot at 8:12 I go tomorrow morning.  I'm looking forward to it.
