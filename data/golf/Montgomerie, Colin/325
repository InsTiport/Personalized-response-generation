COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It was a very good start, yes 3, 2. It's amazing, I keep holing
shots. I don't know what it is. But, yeah, good birdie at the 1st from 20 feet. Then
pulled a wedge shot at the 2nd. It spun back from 10 feet above the hole, spun back in the
hole. So 3, 2, 3 was a great start. Then I missed a shot at the 4th. Then I doubled the
6th. I went big and chipped down, 3-putted. That was a 5 there, doubled that hole. Then
the glorious chances at 8, 9, and 10 -- I missed them all. Then on the 12th, 4-iron. 

Q. One hop and in?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: One hop. It pitched 6 inches short of the hole, and in. Exactly the
same as last week. Amazing. So I saw this one. It was sunny. 

Q. Many more people than you thought?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, well, yeah. There was about six this time. (Laughter.) Five
more than last. So they knew it went in, so that was good. Then I birdied 14 and 17.
That's the first time I ever birdied 17, I think. I always manage to mess up that hole. I
hit a good driver and a 4-iron just over the back, and chip -- chip down. It's the easiest
pin we have there. It was front-left, which means if you do go for it in two, you can
afford to go big and you have room to come back to it. If the pin's in the back of the
green, that's when it's more difficult. Then a good par at the last, because it's playing
very difficult. There's no way to hit it off the last tee at all. Left-to-right wind,
there's nowhere to hit it. So that was, yeah, 67 is good. Two more of them, you never
know. 

Q. What are the odds of you getting Colin Montgomerie back?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: The odds of me getting -- well, the odds of me winning is about the
odds of ... Sorry. 

Q. (Inaudible). 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I don't know. Very, very high. Low. Whatever it is the odds are. I'm
not a betting man. But that's unbelievable, and to hole a second shot as well in the
middle of it from the fairway.

Q. What are the odds of you winning?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: What's that?

Q. What are the odds of you winning?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Very slight. But if I can put two 66s together to get to 14-under,
you never know. I told you yesterday, I haven't given up. So I haven't given up --.

Q. What did you think of the 6th?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: -- Never will until it's mathematically impossible. The 6th hole, I
hit the 6-iron. It was two clubs too many. 

Q. Is that because the wind was gusting?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yes, it was gusting. Then I stopped just as I hit, and it went far,
far too big, yeah, off the back bank. And I just got no shot.

Q. Regarding the Order of Merit, in the last week or two you've been sort of saying,
"It's over. I gave up months ago." "Never give up." Et cetera, et
cetera. (Laughter.) These psychological games, are they changing your --?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: No, come on. I mean, you have to come here and win a tournament.
It's a tall order; especially when you start with 75 in your second match off. You land in
52nd place or something. It doesn't help. So nothing to lose this morning. Went out and
started 3-2 like that. You think, "Okay, well back to level par." Then played
well from then on in. I know this course as well as anybody. I've won here before. I've
been in a playoff here before. I have good memories of this place. And I think two 66s...
You never know. You never know. 

Q. 76 the first round?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well, you see. I had a chance. So you never know. Golf, you're just
not sure. It's not easy out there. It's not easy out there. Not at all. Not easy. 

Q. Fred Couples said that he tried very hard to persuade you to go to America. 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Did he?

Q. Yes. 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Oh, yes. That's right. 

Q. If you went and played California in the winter, in the beginning of the year, that
you would win one of those events. 

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well, it would be nice. Nice thing to say that. Nice of him to think
I'm good enough to do that. I never know. I don't know. I'm on holiday until the 11th of
January, then I might well do something like that. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. 

Q. Would you think of that?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, yeah. I have nothing to prove here. Hopefully. If I go over
there, you never know. I might spend more time over there; I'm not sure yet. I have to
talk to Guy and work it all out. And my wife. (Laughter.)

Q. Can I ask you --?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: You can ask any question. You might not get an answer, but you can
ask any question. (Laughter.)

Q. When you went out this morning, were you thinking 67 and two 66s, or were you
thinking professional pride?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Professional pride this morning. Professional pride, which is high
on my list. 

Q. What was the exchange between Alistair and yourself after the hole in one?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: He walked down the left-hand side. We didn't actually walk together.
He was late. He went to the loo, I think. It's funny, because the ball we holed in one
with last week was in the top pocket. We put it in the top pocket. I said, "Save it
in my bag." Although, I went home, he took my bag down. So it's remained there. So
I've got two balls in the top pocket now. They're both No. 1s. It's amazing. They're both
No. 1s. Callaway No. 1s. (Laughter.) They went in. Yeah, so I've got two of them now. 

Q. What color ball?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Blue. 

Q. What's your normal number?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I don't play with twos. Ones are normal, yeah. Yeah, ones are
normal. 

Q. Check that hole-in-one drawer back at home?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, haven't kept them all. But I think, during amateur golf as
well, I think it's nearly 20 now. Which is an awful lot. An awful lot. Yeah. I need a few
more. I need a few more. Not enough.
