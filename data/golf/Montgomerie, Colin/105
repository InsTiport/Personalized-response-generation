   COLIN MONTGOMERIE: The one at six and seven could have gone in but never mind. It's 79 which is about what I have played this year so continuing my vein of form. 

 Q. First time you have played with Matt Kuchar?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It was. Very impressed. He handled himself very well leading the tournament. Holed a couple of great putts this morning - one on six and one on eight for par and for birdie. Very, very solid a player. As solid a player as I have played with on the US Tour for a long time and someone who will be a great asset to their Ryder Cup Team I am sure.

 Q. How did you practice, what were your expectations?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: There weren't, I couldn't.
