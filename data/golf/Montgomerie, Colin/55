 Q.   How would you describe your play today?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I played very well.   I didn't putt very well, but I played well.   So 69's a very safe start and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   I'm hitting it well.   Tom Watson was right in his press conference yesterday that it's very much a second shot golf course, this.   
The fairways are quite generous, but it's a second shot golf course to get the distance, the control of distance right with the iron shots.   I'm getting that right, so, yeah, I put myself in a position.   
You can only lose it today, you can't win it and I didn't lose it, so we're okay.   We're quite happy.  
   
 Q.   Any long putts fall you or anything?  
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   No, nothing at all.   Nothing.   One for Tom.   But at 64 years old you're allowed that.
