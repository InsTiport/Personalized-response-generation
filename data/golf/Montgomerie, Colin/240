Q. You seemed a bit unlucky this afternoon?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I didn't win a hole. I rimmed a whole lot this afternoon and didn't win a hole and under those circumstances you probably don't deserve to win. He played a lot better this afternoon than he did this morning but overall I played well but didn't score well enough unfortunately. You need to be more under par than I was today and overall I didn't score well enough.
Q. The putting was unlucky?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Well, that's it. Scoring is putting, isn't it?
Q. You seemed to lip out a lot?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well, yeah, 16 was dramatic but never mind.
Q. Since The Open and this Order of Merit has moved into view you have not tightened things up - has that been a factor?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Unfortunately I took two weeks off after The Open and then I came back from the Johnnie Walker and that floored me.  And I took three weeks off and I haven't really got back into things since then. I need to get back into things more than I have -- I don't know why that should be.

You're right, since The Open there haven't been the performances that I have been looking for. I have only had one top ten, or one finish really and that has been disappointing to be honest. Never mind, we'll get back into it.
