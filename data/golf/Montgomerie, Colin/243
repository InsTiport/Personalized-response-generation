Q.  What would you give yourself today?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I only hit about five or six fairways.  I was excited about my short game.  When Phil Mickelson says that was a short game exhibition, I'll take it.

I had very few putts, I only had about 24 putts today.
Q.  That's unlike you.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Very unlike me.  I don't know what the motivation was, I just didn't hit the fairways.  Got up and down the first holes and everything, so I did okay.  So that was all right.
Q.  The scrambling was a good thing?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes, it was.  1, 2, 3; 5, 5, 5.  Should be 4, 4, 4.  I birdied the 8th, hit a sand wedge to about four feet and birdied that.
