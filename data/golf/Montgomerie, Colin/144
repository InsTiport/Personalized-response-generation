   COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I got my swing back together and very safe. Three birdies and only bogey on the first hole, missed a 5-footer, 32 putts out there, for 68, which is good golf. That means I'm hitting the ball well, so go on from there. Go on tomorrow morning, greens should be good tomorrow morning and get a good round under my belt and look forward to starting tomorrow.

 Q. Clearly like playing again on this course?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yes, I enjoy, it I enjoy it, and if anything, the top 20 in the first day means that things are going okay, and then we can build on that over the next three days. 
 Yeah, look forward to it.
