Q. No dropped shots today.  Your take on your round today?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Nah, terrible.  Was 4-under through eight.  Had 10 more chances, missed them all.  So very poor really.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: You weren't expecting that, were you?
Q. No?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Bloody awful.  10 chances.  15 foot was probably the worst.  And I missed them all.  So I had an opportunity there to get going and I didn't get going.  And the winds picking up, it was a golden opportunity to get going today and I didn't do it and I'm disappointed.
Q. Any positives, the fact that you're still in the tournament?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: No positives at all.  No, it's all negative in my world.  There's a wee cloud that follows me around all over the place, a wee black cloud.  Positive?  Yes, I'm hitting the ball great tee to green.  If I can get the putter working, I have a chance.  Simple as that.  You know?  I know my way around here.  I'm confident here.  I've hit the ball great today tee to green, great today, and I just haven't taken opportunities, unfortunately, and you've gotta do that.  To win you've gotta take opportunities, and unfortunately that wasn't the case.
Q. Do you feel any confidence knowing that perhaps you got the better end of the draw here with the weather coming in?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well, let's hope so.  You know?  The Germans just started.  The wind usually drops when he starts playing.  So let's hope he gets the wrong end of the draw for a change.  Eh?  Yeah.  But at the same time yeah, it wasn't difficult out there today.  You could hit the greens in regulation, which they're big enough, you should do.  But you've gotta take the chances.  You've gotta take the putts when you have the chance to take them.  And I didn't do that today.
