 Q. Long two days?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Very long two days, very long week unfortunately. Looking forward to getting the Ryder Cup team picked. A few are doing well. Rory McIlroy has got it back to four under which is great and Francesco Molinari is going well and just starting now. Very unlucky with the weather now and we wish him well. 
 I played with Matt Kuchar and very impressive the first two days. Only made one mistake on the sixth where he pulled it left and made five. That's the only mistake in two days and he will be a tremendous asset for the American Ryder Cup Team and I wish him well for the rest of the event. Super nice guy and super nice play.

 Q. You'll be following the Europeans now?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: That's what I'll be doing the next few days, following the Europeans and seeing what happens. I have spoken to everyone I needed to speak to about their schedules before and including Gleneagles and understand their commitments over here and understand the ones playing at Gleneagles and I am fine about that. I look forward to selecting a very, very strong team within the next fortnight.

 Q. Can you see Sergio on that team?
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: At this stage it is not looking likely, no.
