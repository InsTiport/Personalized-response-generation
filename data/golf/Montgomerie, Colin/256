COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I would not look anymore wind than this to be honest.  This is about at its limit and it played quite well this morning.  The Tour were good; they moved up a few tees.  They were sensible, moved up a few tees and had some sensible pin positions.  The scoring is as expected.
Q.  You are used to playing under pressure, but this is a different type of pressure; you were expected to do well on a course you created.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yeah, this is one of the weeks I probably should have taken home off, stayed home and watched.

No, I'll go and play and take whatever comes my way here.  But so far, so good.  Everyone seems very happy, especially conditions of the course as well.  Never mind the layout of it but the conditioning is, may I say, superb, and all credit to the greenskeeper here, John Plummet. (Ph)
Q.  Your own game, you're using a different putter.  Are you comfortable with that?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yeah, it's actually the same putter from five years ago, I found it, back in 1999, found it out there.  Not too bad.  I holed a good putt, an eagle at last there, which was my ninth hole, and I missed a couple of them were disappointing, but overall not bad.
Q.  How long was the eagle?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  It was about 45 feet.  That was good.  No, everything's fine.  As I said, it's playing as expected, I think.  As I said, I think it's playing as expected with not much more wind here than we have already and it will play well.

I'm glad to see a number of, you know, top, top players are up there.  Darren, I'm glad to see he is he's up there, as well as myself and Padraig, and obviously we'll make a push towards the weekend.
