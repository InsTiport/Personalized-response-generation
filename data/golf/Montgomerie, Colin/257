Q. First of all, well done for getting finished.
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Yes we did well to get round because the light was fading fast out there. It wasn't very quick out there towards the end either but we did okay. I dropped a couple of shots coming in which was a pity because I was getting a bit tired and I was trying to rush in to get finished. But the good thing is that I don't have to have another early start tomorrow morning; that was the main objective. I played well from tee to green today but left a couple of shots out there, too many actually, but there you go.
