70 (-2)  CARNOUSTIE
Q. Thoughts on the round?

COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  I had a poor middle -- I dropped one at the 17th and one at the first and then didn't really make a birdie from then on. I missed a short one at the ninth there for a birdie on my last hole -- about a 6-footer -- which was disappointing but it was ok. No disaster. I am hanging on in there. Looking forward to                 St. Andrews tomorrow because the conditions are going to get worse tomorrow and that's the course to play. This was not a bad day to get Carnoustie.
