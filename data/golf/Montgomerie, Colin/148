   COLIN MONTGOMERIE: It was difficult this afternoon. It was windy obviously as it was all day. Difficult to get the ball close because it spins back, and the greens are quite soft. So it's quite difficult to score, and people are finding the same.   
 But 1-over is not by no means out of this tournament, by no means out of this tournament. A good birdie at the last, is always nice to finish with a birdie and start tomorrow morning early and see what we can do.   
  
  Q. Lee Westwood was especially critical of the greens today.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: The greens are soft. The greens are soft and there was an awful lot of rain. I was practising out here last week and they had to close the range a couple of times, even the range. It has been awful, awful weather, and the greens have suffered because of that, because they are soft.   
 But that's what we've just got to putt up with I'm afraid.   
  
  Q. Should they be dug up and redone?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Well, I've got a couple rounds left to play, a couple of very important round left to play, so leave them the way they are, thank you very much.   
  
  Q. His point was with modern techniques, no matter how much it rains ...   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Yeah, I think that some greens drain better than these, there's no question. So we'll have to look into that at a future date.   
  
  Q. Did they discuss that after last year's tournament?   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Wasn't discussed after last year's tournament, no.   
  
  Q. He's afraid they might just be patched over next few years and never sort of redone properly.   
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Speak to him. I can't ... I'm chairman of the tournament, I'm not a greenskeeper, unfortunately.
