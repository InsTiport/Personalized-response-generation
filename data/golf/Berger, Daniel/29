Q. Daniel, can you just summarize your round for the day and what your day was like out there.
DANIEL BERGER: The day was fun.  I ball struck it really well and actually putted pretty good, just didn't get a lot of putts to go in.  Overall, though, I had a good time.
Q. What was it like for you playing in the final pairing of the U.S. Open?
DANIEL BERGER: It was fun.  I want to be there more often so I've just got to keep doing the things I've been doing.
Q. Any changes in the course throughout the day today?  What did you think of the course setup?
DANIEL BERGER: I thought it was really difficult but fair.  In the end, the greens got a little bumpy, but that's to be expected.  Obviously, someone's got to win, so Brooks did a really good job coming down the stretch making putts.  So that was the difference.
