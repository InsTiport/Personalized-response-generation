THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome Daniel Berger to the interview room here at the Frys.com Open.
Daniel, thank you for joining us.
DANIEL BERGER: Thank you for having me.
THE MODERATOR: Certainly want to start off by talking about your rookie season, wonderful performance that led to you being selected by your peers as the rookie of the year.
First like to hear a little bit about how you reflect on your rookie season.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, I think overall it was a lot of fun.  You set the goals in the beginning of the year, and some of them you set higher than the others.
I think for me, rookie of the year was definitely one of the higher goals I set in the beginning of the year.  Just to kind of be recognized by my peers and the guys I competed with all year was a great accomplishment and gave me a lot of confidence going into the new season.
THE MODERATOR: Throughout the season, there was a stretch where you did struggle a little bit but bounced back with some incredible play in the playoffs finishing runner-up heading into Atlanta, and then continuing history being the only rookie to make all way to Atlanta and earning those honors.
Can you talk a little but about that time?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I think that stretch of bad golf, it actually wasn't that bad of.  It was just kind of trying to find my rhythm.
I kept doing the same things and it kind of paid off towards the end of the year.  It just took one good finish in Boston, and that gave me the confidence for the next couple weeks.
Like I said before, that was my main goal in the beginning of the year, to make it the TOUR Championship.  To do that was impressive for me.
I was really proud of the way that I battled from a mediocre middle of the season.
THE MODERATOR: We've talked a lot about the youth on tour right now.  With Jordan winning player the year and you both coming through college at the same time, how do you see the future of the TOUR with this caliber of player coming out around your college years?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, I think the future of the PGA TOUR is really bright.  I think the younger guys are getting better and better at a younger age.
I think the competition in junior golf and amateur and collegiate golf is getting better and better.  Everyone wants to be really good so you have to continue to get better or the younger guys are going to pass you.
To look at Jordan and the career that he's had so far at such an early age is pretty impressive.  Definitely motivates all the younger guys to play well.
THE MODERATOR: Switching gears to this week, this will be your second time here.  What do you like about this place?  What are you looking forward to this week?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great start to the year, being in wine country.  It's a great setting.  Silverado Course is a great host.
Yeah, a lot of fun to get back.  I know there was only two weeks since the TOUR Championship, but really does feel like a new year coming back and seeing all the new faces and all the Web.com tour guys.
It's just exciting to get back to competing and playing some golf.
THE MODERATOR: Before I open up for questions, looking forward to this season, following rookie of the year season, what are your goals?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I think every year you want to win.  I think that's one of my main goals this year, is to try to get a win.  I came close a couple times last year.
You know, just got to keep doing the same things I've been doing and just have fun.  I feel like that's when I played my best last year is when I just enjoyed it and kept the expectations low and just went out there and played golf.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  All right, thank you, Daniel, for joining us.
DANIEL BERGER: Thank you.
