 Q.  Daniel, a terrific opening round of 65, signed off in style.  Tell us about the second shot to the last.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it was just a great number, 67 yards, a little half 60, and one-hopped right in there, and no better way to finish a round than with a 2.   
 Q.  You started at the 10th, level par for the front nine, then home in 29.  What changed?  
DANIEL BERGER: I just kind of stayed patient.  I'd been hitting it great all day and then some putts fell and I chipped it good.  Just overall a great round for myself.   
 Q.  Give us a sense of the conditions out there.  It seems pretty breezy to us, yet the scoring is terrific.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, they set the course up fantastic today.  I mean, they moved some tees up that deservedly needed to be moved up.  It's firm and fast, so hopefully the rain doesn't come in and it'll stay like this for the rest of the week.   
 Q.  You spoke to us earlier in the Playoffs and you said it was a dream come true just to make the Playoffs and be with the guys that you've watched on television for years.  You've got a realistic chance now of making the TOUR Championship.  How exciting is that?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it's exciting, but I've got to stay patient.  There's three more rounds left.  If it happens, it happens; if it doesn't, I've had a good year regardless.  It is what it is; you know what I mean?   
 Q.  A lot of fireworks out of Daniel Berger, day one finishing birdie-birdie-eagle.  How did you kick it into gear there?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, it's a great way to finish a round, especially shooting even par on the front nine, and to put myself in contention feels really nice.   
 Q.  You were even par through 10.  What mindset did you adapt the last eight holes?  You were able to go 6-under and shoot 29 coming in.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, just stayed patient.  I've been playing well the last couple weeks and hitting it great, and just tried to hang in there and have some putts fall a get a couple birdies.   
 Q.  What positivity did you see out of Deutsche Bank?  I know you were struggling prior to that, you tied for 12th, seems like it's carried over to this week?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, like I said, I was just kind of impatient.  I really wasn't playing that bad, and I was just kind of forcing it, and the last two weeks I've just kind of said, you know, whatever happens, happens.  That's what's really been great for my success the last couple weeks.   
 Q.  It's kind of a three-headed race for the Rookie of the Year with Justin, Tony Finau, yourself.  How big of an incentive are you placing on trying to get into the top 30 and separate yourself from the pack?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I want to be in that top 30 so I can play four majors next year, and it sets my year up for weeks to come.  Like I said, I've had a great year regardless of what happens, and I'm just going to do what I can control, and if it happens, it happens.
