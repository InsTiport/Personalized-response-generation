Q. How would you assess that score out there?
DANIEL BERGER: Solid, actually, believe it or not.  It's just one of those days where the golf course is extremely difficult.  The greens are super fast.  If you hit it in the rough, you're just penalized.  Pretty good day.
Q. You have a good history here.
DANIEL BERGER: There's no better place to sleep than your own bed.  So extremely happy.  I have two more days and just see how it goes from here.
Q. How much more laboring was today than yesterday?
DANIEL BERGER: It was tough.  I got off to a good start, but you know, the back nine is brutal and the greens got a little bumpy.  Pleased to kind of get it in there can give myself a chance going into the weekend.
Q. We talked yesterday about you and Justin playing together two days in a row.  How much does it help you to have that familiarity?
DANIEL BERGER: It's nice.  We play a lot of golf at home.  It's a comfort zone, for sure.  We're at the same score root now, so you never know, we might play again tomorrow and hopefully come Sunday, we're right in there looking for a championship.
Q. Must feel great playing well in front of family and friends.
DANIEL BERGER: It is, yeah.  It really is.  We don't get to do this often, so to have my family and friends come out is really great.  I look forward to it every year.
Q. Can you talk about your round?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I got off to a great start.  The back nine, it was brutal out there.  It's one of the toughest nines that we play in all the PGA TOUR.  When the wind blows and the greens get a little bumpy, it's just added difficulty.
Q. You got off pretty quick, you got the two birdies right off the bat.  Got a way from you a little bit or how did you feel the rest of the round?
DANIEL BERGER: I felt great.  It really is extremely difficult.  Like if you make just the smallest mistake, it's just exaggerated so much that you really have to be on all points of your game to play 18 really good holes.
Justin, he played 15 good holes and he has a 4- or 5-putt on 15, and that can happen to anyone.  It's one of those weeks where you've just got to kind of stay patient mentally.
Q. Stoked to see Tiger playing well?
DANIEL BERGER: I love to see Tiger playing well.  He's one of my greatest heros in the sport.  To see him play well is awesome.  Try to stay away from looking at the leaderboards too much.  There's so much golf left and anything can happen.  Just stay patient and see how the weekend is.
Q. Do you notice a difference in the gallery?
DANIEL BERGER: It's amazing to have so many people out here.  We had a pretty good group, too, and we had a lot of people out there but you go back and see Tiger's group and they have just thousands of guys.  It's really fun and really great for the tournament.
Q. So you can feel the buzz?
DANIEL BERGER: Absolutely.
Q. How do you describe the greens?
DANIEL BERGER: The greens are just bumpy.
Q. Grass.
DANIEL BERGER: There's not a lot of grass on them to be honest.  But I grew up on this type of -- on these type of greens, bermudagreens, so for me it's comfortable.  I've been putting well, so I feel good.
