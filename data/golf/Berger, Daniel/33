Q. Great way to finish the round with that birdie putt.  You're sixth of the day, clean card, great round for you.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, thank you, I played nicely and hit a bunch of really good tee shots, which kind of set up my round.  When you're in the fairway you can be aggressive and that's what happened today.
Q. I was looking at the difference between yesterday's round ball striking for you than today, three more greens today in regulation and just a couple feet closer made a world of difference, didn't it?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I've been striking it really well and I haven't -- coming off of two weeks of rest from Hawaii, so I feel fresh and I'm just ready to go and excited to play this weekend.
Q. How much fun is this golf course, particularly that stretch on the back nine?
DANIEL BERGER: It is, it's one that I really look forward to.  You always get kind of that butterfly in your stomach when you walk through the tunnel on 16, but it's a great atmosphere and it's something that I'll have on my schedule for a long time.
Q. You follow-up a 68 yesterday with a 65 today.  How are the conditions playing today?
DANIEL BERGER: They were perfect.  I think it was a little chilly this morning, but I got off to a really good start and kind of just hung in there and hit some good shots.  Made some birdies.
Q. Iron game is strong, so is the putting, what carried over into round two to put together a 65?
DANIEL BERGER: I think my speed control has just been so good this week.  If I'm missing putts I'm just tapping them in and it's been a lot less stressful than weeks past.  Just got to keep doing the same things that I've been doing.
Q. Obviously the energy from the fans here is something we always talk about.  What does that do for you on the golf course?
DANIEL BERGER: It's really exciting.  To have so many people out here cheering for you, it's not like we see this very often with the amount of crowds that we have here this week.  We're warming up this morning and you have fans at 6 a.m. running to the green on 16 to get their seats.  So it's pretty electric and just excited to have a chance this weekend.
Q. I was there for 16 when you came through and they were very loud for you, I must say.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, they're pretty excited out there and we had some fun.
Q. Some comments on your second round, if we can.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I played well, got off to a good start, birdied 1 and 2, which was nice in the cold weather.  Just kind of played well the rest of the day.
Q. What's your season been like, just sort of so far?  It's early, but what's it been like this year so far?
DANIEL BERGER: It hasn't been quite what I really wanted it to be.  I think the expectations from the last couple years were pretty high, so just trying to maintain a lower expectation and just kind of have fun and play well and that's kind of what happened this week.
Q. Did the expectations get really sky high after you won your second straight in Memphis and then you had that amazing playoff and you just started to think, oh I'm going to be up there in contention every single week?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I think when -- I know how well I can play, so when you see that, you want to be in contention every week, sometimes you put a little extra pressure on yourself.  So just kind of going out there and just having fun has really been the key for me.
Q. The Presidents Cup do something for you as far as like just sort of telling you that you're at that level, you're there?
DANIEL BERGER: Absolutely.  To play against 12 of the best international players in the world and win like we did and win some points for our team was definitely huge for my confidence.  I know I'm good enough to play on that Ryder Cup team, just got to continue to play well and make good decisions.
Q. The atmosphere out here is crazy, how do you focus with all the craziness?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I think the first year was a lot harder for me.  This is the fourth time I've been here, so I've kind of figured it out a little bit as the years have gone on.  But mostly it's just about just enjoying yourself.  The crowds are huge, but they're out here rooting us on so you got to take that energy and turn it into something.
Q. 17 is that super short par-4, how do you think your way through that?
DANIEL BERGER: Go for the green every time.  That's pretty simple for me.
Q. Is there any risk involved with that?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, there's risk on every shot, but you just got to kind of get up there and hit a good one.
