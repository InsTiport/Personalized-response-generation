Q.   Daniel, what a nice round of golf, feeling right at home on your PGA TOUR rookie season. 
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, you know, for some reason I seem to play well in South America.   I played well on the Web.com TOUR in South America.   Just feel at home, got the ocean here, the palm trees, it's just like being back home.

Q.   You're from Florida State, got to play with Tony Finau.   Who hits it further, you or Tony?
DANIEL BERGER:   I'd say Tony hits it a little further.   I don't know, we didn't hit many drivers out here.   We were just trying to hit the fairways.   I would say Tony hits it a little further. 

Q.   Did you hit many drivers off the tee, because this golf course is playing a little faster, you're getting some run‑out?
DANIEL BERGER:   I think I hit maybe two drivers all day.   It's just kind of one of those courses where you've got to hit the fairway.   Super tight off the tee, so just put it in play and you've got some birdie opportunities. 

Q.   PGA TOUR rookie, you're tied for the lead. 
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, this is what we work so hard for, so it's great to get off to a good start, but got to keep it going.

Q.   Did you put the governor on it as you came home or did you try to get it as deep as you could? 
DANIEL BERGER:   Absolutely not.   Yeah, I go all out no matter if I'm 2‑over or 10‑under.   No, I'm trying to make as many birdies as I can because that's what you've got to do to play well out here.
