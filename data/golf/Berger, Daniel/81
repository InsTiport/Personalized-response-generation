 Q.  Overall pretty happy with the way you played so far?  DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, really happy.  Put a lot of good prep in last couple of days, so it feels nice to see some good results.   Q.  Mayakoba, tie for the lead?  Did that seem like the same kind of experiences today?  DANIEL BERGER: Not quite.  I mean, this stage is a lot bigger than Mayakoba, but I definitely learned a lot from Mexico, so just trying to build on a good experience over there.   Q.  The atmosphere overall, what's that like in playing some of the larger holes that are packed with everyone out there?  DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, you know, to start on the back 9, you know, late in the afternoon, you've got everyone out there.  But, I mean, I just really hit the ball great today and made some nice putts, and I birdied 16 which was pretty cool.  The crowd went crazy, so that was awesome.   Q.  What was your reaction when you birdied 16?  Did you give the crowd a fist pump?  DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, gave it a little fist pump and heard some Seminole war chants going, which was pretty cool. No, I mean, honestly, that was probably one of the most nervous I have ever been, but I just took a couple of deep breaths and hit a nice shot in there.   Q.  Solid performance today.  How do you kind of regroup and focus on tomorrow?  DANIEL BERGER: Well, you know, I've still got two more holes left on the day.  I have to go out there and stay focused for two more holes, and then, you know, look to continue making some birdies on the weekend, because that's what you're going to need to have a good finish here.
