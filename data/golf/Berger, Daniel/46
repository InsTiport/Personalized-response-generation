Q. Your first go around at the Tournament of Champions.  Despite the finish, I still think a solid day.  Your thoughts?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I played really solidly all throughout the day.  It was really one yard away from being good on the last hole, and I probably wouldn't be as frustrated.  One bogey today on a semi-windy day out here is pretty good.
I made a lot of good putts and hit a lot of good drives, and I didn't have too many bad shots.
Q. We chatted briefly before the round and you have all new clubs in the golf bag today.  First time under pressure; I guess the verdict's good?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, there's still three more days of golf left.  But I think regardless of how I played, it wasn't going to be the equipment; it was going to be me.
But I prepared really well for this event and have got off to a good start and just hang in there and see what happens.
Q. A new apparel company, golf club equipment company, golf course you're playing the first time competitively this year; a 68, what worked well for you?
DANIEL BERGER: I think I drove the ball really well, and I made a few putts early in the round, which kind of calmed me down.  But overall, just everything -- other than the bogey on the 18th hole, it was a really solid round.
