Q. How do you evaluate the round?  Obviously you started with a lead.  How do you look at this?
DANIEL BERGER: I mean, I was playing all right.  I think I was just a little rusty, and that kind of came out on the final round when it was most important, but it was fun.  Russ played great, and he deserved to win.
Q. Were you keeping an eye on where things were during the round?
DANIEL BERGER: I looked at it a little bit, just like I naturally do in this position.  But like I said, I hit too many bad shots, and the golf course played so different today than it did yesterday.  Just 58 today was ridiculous, but 58 in the afternoon would have been the best score I've ever -- I mean, it is the best score, but you know what I mean.  It just was a different golf course this afternoon than it was this morning.
Q. Can you take us through what was working on the back nine yesterday compared to today?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, well, I hit greens.  Today I didn't hit any greens.  I bogeyed four straight holes to start the back nine.  Actually if I don't hit it in the water on the par-5 and make a par and I don't hit it in the water on 15 and make a par, then I'm one back going into the last hole, and who knows.  I make a par there, maybe Russ doesn't make that putt.  It's a game of inches, and I feel like I just didn't have the inches on my side today.
Q. How did you handle sleeping on the lead?
DANIEL BERGER: I slept great.  I slept great when I won in Memphis, I slept great last night.  It just wasn't my day today.
Q. No nerves or anything?
DANIEL BERGER: Not really.  I mean, I'm comfortable in the position.  Sometimes you get it done, sometimes you don't, but you just learn from it and move on.
Q. What will you use moving forward in other tournaments?
DANIEL BERGER: I need to hit more fairways down the stretch.  I didn't hit enough fairways, and that cost me in the end, but the fact that I lost by, whatever, three and played absolutely terrible today is not the worst deal in the world.
