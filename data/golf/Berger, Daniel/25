 Q.  3-under today. Not too many low scores out there today, so you were one of the lowest so far. What was it like? Conditions are really windy today.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it's windy and some of the greens are receptive, some of them are firm so it's a little bit of a guessing game. But I played really patient golf today and other than the bogey on 18, pretty proud of the way I played.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your game right now? Playing on a medical, a major medical right now. How is your wrist? How is your game?  
DANIEL BERGER: Well, I cleared up the medical the first event of the season, so I've got full status now. But, you know, new caddie, Josh Cassell and I just feel like overall the team part of the game is more there now than it has been in a long time. And sometimes it just takes a little bit of momentum, which I feel like I lacked a lot of last year, so just looking to continue that good play.   
 Q.  You had great play last week in Phoenix, ending on good play now. What is your next stop?  
DANIEL BERGER: I'll be at the Honda and then probably play a couple in a row in Florida. So back home now.
