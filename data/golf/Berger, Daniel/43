 Q.  That was a tough shot on 17 that you recovered from, unfortunately for bogey, but then to finish up on 18 with a birdie, how does that feel about going into tomorrow?  
DANIEL BERGER: It makes tomorrow feel a lot better.  I feel like I've got a chance.  Couple weeks ago I was in the same position and got it done.  So obviously trying to run down Jordan's going to be tough, but if I play well, I've got a chance.   
 Q.  You've got to feel good about your iron work this week, especially today.  What's working out there?  
DANIEL BERGER: I'm just hitting a lot of shots close and making a few putts along the way.  That's been the difference this week.   
 Q.  You have a T5 finish at this course.  What do you like about playing here?  
DANIEL BERGER: I just think it sets up nicely for me off the tee.  I hit a bunch of fairways, and I've played well here last year.  If I just keep doing the same things I'm doing, hopefully I'll have a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  I thought that was a good round of golf.  Just one bad break there on 17?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I had nothing really going for me there.  I just had to pitch it out back in the fairway and hit a good shot and had a chance to make par.  Overall I'm not going to let that one hole affect my round because I played really well today.   
 Q.  Yeah, how important was that bounce back for you at 18?  I don't think it was that easy of a four and a half footer?  
DANIEL BERGER: No, it was a big breaker left to right, and the grandstand shadow was kind of in the way, so it's tough to see.  But it makes it a lot easier being 2-back, and not 3 or 4 back.
