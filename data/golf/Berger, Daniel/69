Q. Daniel, I really admire the way you were able to bounce back after the double bogey, to pick up those three straight birdies at 14, 15 and 16.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, it was a nice way to finish.  I kind of calmed down a little bit.  Obviously when you're playing with Jason, you've got some nerves going.  I just kind of hung in there and finished off strong.
Q. What are your thoughts going into the final round?
DANIEL BERGER: Well, I've got to shoot a real low one given the way Jason has been playing.  Just going to do the same things I've been doing and hopefully that'll get it done.
Q. You have a battle within a battle.  You have a battle to win this tournament and a battle to finish top 30 in the FedExCup standings.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it's a big week, but regardless of what happens, I've had a great year, so it's just fun for me to be here.
Q. Up-and-down third round, Daniel.  You were able to bounce back the last four holes, get it at 1-under par.  How would you describe your round?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it was a fight for sure to get it back to 1-under par, but it was fun, man.  To have those big crowds and play with Jason, it's always a good time.
Q. What was it like being in that moment in the final group in the third leg of the FedExCup Playoffs?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it's pretty surreal, but I've worked hard to get here, and one more good day, and hopefully I'll be there next week.
Q. How much is that top 30 number kind of in the back of your mind as you get ready for the final 18 holes?
DANIEL BERGER: Honestly through three rounds I haven't really thought about it.  I'm just going to go out there and play golf, and if it happens, it happens, and if not, I'll be all right with that.
