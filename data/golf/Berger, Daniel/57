Q. Going to make it happen.
DANIEL BERGER: I just hung in there.  It was a grind but to get it done here in Memphis is like a dream come true.
Q. Little nervous on the back-9 at all when you bogeyed 10 to start?
DANIEL BERGER: I was nervous from the first hole.  Good nerves, you know, the type of nerves that you want to feel every single time you play.  So, just like I said, it's just a dream come true to finally be a champion.
Q. Those long birdie putts in the middle of the back-9 there, did you have a feeling that would clinch it in?
DANIEL BERGER: I thought it was good enough but it's never enough when you've got Hall of Famers coming for you and Dustin Johnson already in the clubhouse.  You know, just try to do my best and whatever happens.
Q. Were you scoreboard watching when he posted the 9-under?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah.  I wanted to know what I needed to do.  I rebounded nicely on the back-9 and just excited to be here.
Q. All week, what's been working for you?
DANIEL BERGER: I think my driver was the biggest thing.  I broke my drive and got a new one.  It worked immediately and even better than the other one.  It's not common.
Q. Phil said he talked to you.  Call him Philip now?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah.
Q. Next week U.S. Open.  Always a ton of confidence going in there.
DANIEL BERGER: I got to do what I did this week and if I can do that, then I'll be just fine next week.
