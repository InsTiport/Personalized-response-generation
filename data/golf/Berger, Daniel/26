DANIEL BERGER: When you don't hit the fairway, you've got to take your medicine.  There was two shots I hit out of the rough there, two of the worse lies I've ever had in my life.  I hit it like 40, 50 yards down the fairway, got up-and-down.  Those are the ones that keep the momentum going.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: It was 2, I hit one left and had to chip out.  And then on the par 5 on the back nine, 13 or 14 --  14, 15.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure.  I mean, things of this nature can take up to a year.  And obviously if I was hanging around at home and doing nothing, would be all alone and fine, but I'm out here competing every week.
But it's finally healthy.  I feel like I can do the things that I need to do that I wasn't able to do towards the end of last year, where now I can put in the reps that I wasn't able to do before.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I bought a boat.  The first month was awesome.  I haven't taken a month off from competitive golf in ten years.  And then after that I got pretty bored.  I was pretty ready to go.
Q. You feel like flying under the radar kind of suits you?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, listen, it's a major championship, and you have to perform, and you have to play 72 great holes of golf.  And halfway through, I've done that.
So the challenge is going to be the next 36 holes, and it's not going to get any easier.  So I've just got to stay patient and do the things that I did the last couple of days.
Q. Very different course (indiscernible) Long Island course?
DANIEL BERGER: I don't know.  I think I peak at the right time at that event and this event.  But my game has been trending.  I haven't had quite the results that I wanted, but I felt like incrementally I've gotten better over the last three or four weeks.  Made some changes.  And that's been the biggest difference.
Q. How does that experience at Shinnecock (indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: I mean, it feels much more like an Open or a British Open -- I mean, excuse me, a U.S. Open than it does a PGA.  But we're playing for a major championship, so I don't care if we're playing on the beach.  But it's just I've got to continue to do the things that I did the last two days.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: If I knew that answer, I'd be playing a lot better.  But, no, I made a change with my swing coach, starting work with Cameron McCormick about a month and a half ago, and I feel like I've gotten just a little bit better.  And that was really the difference.  I feel like my knowledge around the greens, my chipping, my bunker game, we looked at some stuff and figured out some things that I need to get better at, and I've gotten better at those things.  And when you put it all together equals good scores.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: It was really nothing significant at all.  Tiny little setup things.  Around the greens it's just been learning some different shots and some different variety of shots that I didn't have.  I never knew that I had some the ability that I had around the greens that I feel like I was able to bring out in the last couple of weeks.
Q. (Question regarding Brooks Koepka)?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I mean, I'm friends with him.  I think, you know, playing-wise we've been on two different schedules this year, at least.  But we have a lot of the same group of friends, and we see a lot of each other.
But like I said, our schedules have been so different this year, I feel like he's been there and I've been there, so we haven't spent a lot of time on the course.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: Not that much.  I mean, he does his own thing, I do my own thing.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: No, not really.  I think he's got it figured out on how to perform well at the right time, and that's really what it comes down to when you're playing major championships, is what do you do in the weeks before that best gets you prepared to play well that week.  I feel like Tiger was the one who really dialed it in better than anyone, and I feel like Brooks has now kind of figured out what works for him.
Q. Brooks's round yesterday inspire you in any way last night?
DANIEL BERGER: No, not really.  I thought that round was incredible.  And, I mean, it's four days of really hard golf.  So you're going to have your ups and downs, you're going to play some good rounds and some bad rounds, but it's just trying to save as many shots as possible.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: No, I just kind of wanted to stick to the same kind of philosophy that I had been brought up with in my career, and it's not a very technical one.  And I didn't want someone who was just going to be a swing instructor, I wanted a golf coach who I could talk to about all the different aspects of the game.
When I saw the success he had with Jordan, the type of person he was, there's a lot of great coaches, but it just kind of fit for me.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: That's a long story.  I don't think we have time for that.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
DANIEL BERGER: Probably about a month and a half, two months ago.  It's slowly gotten better, and just a lot of treatment and a lot of rest.  And that's really been the key.
