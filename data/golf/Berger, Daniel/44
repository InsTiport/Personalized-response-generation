 Q.  Talk about the day, obviously off to a good start.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I played well today and didn't get off to a great start but made some birdies coming in, and it was overall a good round.   
 Q.  Talk me through that eagle there on 16.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I hit a great drive there and had only 8-iron in, which felt like a par-4 to me, but hit a nice shot in there and made the putt.
