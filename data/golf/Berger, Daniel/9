  Q. Just an assessment on the week?
 DANIEL BERGER:   Overall the week was great.  Obviously I didn't play today the way I wanted to, but seemed like if you got out there a couple hours before the last couple groups you could have scored a little bit better and then kind of that stretch of 7 to 13 is when the wind really picked up and I just didn't play well enough for enough holes and that kind of cost me.  But it was a good week.
 Q. Switching gears to Sony now, obviously a completely different golf course, flat, a little less wind.  How do you take how well you played here and kind of just start to kind of move forward to that and maybe change your game plan how to play that golf course?
 DANIEL BERGER:   I think obviously next week's a little tighter, see how the course sets up in terms of firmness and fastness of the greens, but I'm driving it well and in I make a few putts then that really can be the difference between winning and not winning.  I felt like today or this whole week I played well enough to win, I just didn't hole enough putts.  So that's a positive for me, I just need to continue to do the things I'm doing and good results will happen.
 Q. In your opinion on Waialae, what's the biggest key for you to be successful there?
 DANIEL BERGER:   You got to hit the fairways.  You have that Bermuda rough where you catch those fliers and if you're not in the fairway you can't attack the pins and that's the biggest difference.
