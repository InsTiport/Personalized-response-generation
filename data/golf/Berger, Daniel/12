  DANIEL BERGER:   Well, I didn't have my A Game and still scored pretty well.  That was positive.  Still in the golf tournament and one more good day and should have a chance coming down the last couple holes.
 I just didn't capitalize on some of the earlier holes I hit some good shots on.  I was in the middle of the fairway on 2 with a 7-iron in my hand and didn't get up-and-down and made par.  A couple other holes I felt like I could have done a better job on.
 Overall it was a good scoring day.  You look at the scores, they are pretty low still.   Obviously with the rain, they got a little softer toward the end, but you know, we'll see how tomorrow goes.  Hopefully it firms up a little bit and plays pretty tough.
 Q. Do you feel like you have a much better chance to come-from-behind if it's tougher conditions?
 DANIEL BERGER:   I do, yeah.  I think the tougher it is, the better chance I'll have.  I think obviously if I'm four or five shots back with one round to play, I'm going to have to shoot a really good round.  Whoever is at the top is going to have to not shoot a good round.
 It is what it is, but I'm in a good position and you take away the one or two guys that are at the top, and I'd be right there tied for the lead.  Overall it's been a good three days.
 Q. Has this been another building block in what you've been ramping up to since March with how well you've been playing?
 DANIEL BERGER:   I really figured out my golf game, and I think I haven't let golf really affect my attitude.
 Just speaking on Rory's comments the other day, I think sometimes you can get a little bit too -- into performance and it can affect your off-the-course life.  I think I've done a really good job of kind of being able to balance the two, and winning earlier in the year really freed me up, and I feel like I just go out there and enjoy the day, and whatever I shoot, I shoot, and that's kind of been my attitude the last two or three months.
