  Q. Assess your play.
 DANIEL BERGER:   18-under after three round is pretty good for me.  I don't think I've ever been in that position.  So I mean, you still got to make a bunch of birdies even though the course is scorable.  So happy with my play and another good grouping.  I got to play with Harris and saw a bunch of good golf shots so just excited for one more day.
 Q. What kind of changed for you a little bit on the back nine?  Maybe it was a little bit of a slow start, but you kind of picked it up on the back.  Any change?
 DANIEL BERGER:   I just saw a putt or two fall and I felt like I left a lot of shots out there.  But my ball striking the past three days has been the best that it's been in a long time, so if I can just continue that momentum for the next couple weeks then I'll have another chance to win going forward.
 Q. What's your mentality heading into tomorrow?  A lot of guys bunched up at the top of the leaderboard and of course it takes a low number.
 DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, make a bunch of birdies, try to give yourself as many opportunities as possible, play the par-5s well, try to make an eagle here or there, and just make a ton of birdies.
 Q. Is there one key that you have to focus on tomorrow to be successful?
 DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, just be patient like I was today.  I didn't get a bunch of birdies to fall early, but I hung in and shot a good score on the back nine and so if I can do that tomorrow on the front nine then it will be a good week.
