Q. (Inaudible)?
DANIEL BERGER: I think it was more of the actual letting go of the club where I kind of like -- it wasn't the actual hitting of the rock.  It was when my wrist kind of flexed the other way.
Q. Talk us through that second shot on 18 there.
DANIEL BERGER: I took a couple practice swings.  I knew it was going to be close.  The practice swing is never exactly like the full on, aggressive swing that I'm making.  I think I just got a little -- my natural swing is to drop it in a little bit.  It wasn't the actual hitting the rock that hurt.  It was when the club flipped around and my wrist went in the complete opposite direction.
I'm got a great physio team.  From what they say, just keep icing it.  Ibuprofen.  Just see how it goes later in the day.  It hasn't swole up.  If there was anything majorly done to it, it would be blown up right now.  Hopefully it will be and I'll get to be competitive tomorrow against Matt Fitzpatrick.
Q. Did it feel bad that you had to pick up and concede the match there on 18?
DANIEL BERGER: I'm a competitor.  First off, I didn't want to lose as it was, but I wish I would have just chipped it down there and had a chance to make par.  Under the circumstance, the amount of pain I felt there, it just wasn't worth hitting another shot or trying to make another attempt.  Like I said, I wish I got it done, I played Patrick to 18 holes and Phil to 18 holes.  It's fun, but I've got to get better if I want to win those matches.
Q. On 13, was that 3-wood?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah.
Q. Did you push it?
DANIEL BERGER: I just blocked it.  Yeah, terrible shot.
