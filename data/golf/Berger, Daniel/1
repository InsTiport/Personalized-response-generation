Q. Winner of the 2021 AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.  Incredible eagle putt on the last hole.  Did almost exactly revenge of what happened on Saturday when you hit it out of bounds.  How does it feel right now?
DANIEL BERGER:   It's hard to describe.  I mean, I feel like I got a little bit of revenge on the 18th.  I knew it was going to be a tight finish and I just stepped up there and hit a great drive and hit maybe the best 3-wood I've ever hit in my life and the putter was just kind of icing on the cake.  I was really looking to 2-putt that.  But it was a great feeling when it went in and I'm just, it's so hard to win out here.  It's, you know, I feel like everything has to come together to win and I was able to do that this week.
Q. You've been playing some pretty incredible golf since we have come back from COVID last year.  Winning at Colonial.  It just seems like each and every week you're not too far out of the mix.  What's transpired during the time you had off to where you are now because you've become a seriously great player.
DANIEL BERGER:   I'm just trying to get better in every aspect of my game and I feel like I've accomplished that, and I've set some really high goals and I feel like I'm not scared to put in the work.  I'm not the most talented guy out here.  I don't hit it the furthest, but I'll outwork anybody.  So that's where I think, that is my biggest weapon.
Q. You didn't make it into the Masters last fall even after the win just because of how circumstances went.  Even though you're already in the Masters, how good do you feel about your game going into Augusta National and how does the course set up for you?
DANIEL BERGER:   I've played it three times and I feel like I can compete on any golf course I show up at.  And I've really learned a lot about my game and what I need to do to get prepared every week and I've found kind of a little plan that works for me and it's paying off.
Q. Your fourth win and you did it in style.  How much retribution did you feel with how you finished yesterday with hitting it out of bounds?
DANIEL BERGER:   I was disappointed obviously with the way I finished yesterday, but that tee shot actually sets up pretty well for me.  You start it out the left and hit my cut, I just over did it on Saturday.  Today I stepped up there and hit a great one.  I hit one of the best 3-woods I ever hit in my life on to that 18th green and rolled in the putt.  So it was the best way I could have ever imagined finishing.
Q. Key for you, I think you came out very aggressive, obviously eagled the 2nd, got off to a great round.  The only bad shot you hit all day was the one on 8, left you in a bad spot, but it looked like you were controlling your golf game all day long.
DANIEL BERGER:   I tried to stay patient.  Pebble Beach is tough and you have to be aggressive when the course gives opportunities.  I feel like I did that today.  And then you have to make some putts and I made putts today and that was the difference.
Q. What's it feel like knowing you eagled the par-5 18th, probably the long time since the early '80s where a player eagled the 18th to win a golf tournament at Pebble Beach?
DANIEL BERGER:   Any time you do anything historical here at Pebble Beach you know you accomplished something special.  It's a tournament I haven't put on my schedule as many times as I think I should have and I'll be back here many, many years, it's one of my favorite events of the year.
Q. Since we came back from the shutdown your golf game has been spot on.  Two wins now in less than a year.  Is it part of it because you're healthy now?
DANIEL BERGER:   A lot of it is healthy, a lot of it is playing free.  Once I am able to kind of play every week without any fear and then I played my best golf and that's what I've been doing.
