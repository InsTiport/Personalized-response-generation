Q. How would you describe your round today?
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I think this is the harder golf course for me so just to shoot 5-under here is a good round and anything under par here is a good round.  Tomorrow if the wind blows it's going to be much tougher here so I prefer to play over there at Pebble.  But I'm in a good position.  So I hit a lot of good shots today and putted really well and much improved from last week.
Q. When you come out and you come to Spyglass knowing it's the harder golf course does that put a little more emphasis on trying to put together that 3-, 4-, 5-under par round?
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I mean, like I said, you look at the leaderboard right now and 75 percent of the scores at the top are at Pebble Beach.  So it's receptive here, it's receptive there, but like I was saying, if the wind picks up tomorrow, it's going to be much tougher here hitting shots through the trees and trying to figure out where the wind is.  So I'm in a great position.
Q. What's your biggest key for you tomorrow at Pebble Beach?
DANIEL BERGER:   Probably staying patient, because you're used to seeing a lot of holes that are birdie opportunities and if you get the opposite wind direction it could be tricky.  So just try to hit as many good shots as possible and roll in some putts and shoot a couple under and we'll be in a good position going into the weekend.
Q. You mentioned a lot different today than it was last week.  What was the biggest difference for you?
DANIEL BERGER:   Health-wise I feel way better this week.  My back was bothering me all last week and now I feel like I can swing a little faster, swing a little freer, and my ball striking today was a hundred percent improvement versus how I played last week, so it's a good feeling.
Q. It's interesting, a little warmer last week than this week and the back felt worse last week than this week?
DANIEL BERGER:   Sometimes that's just the way it goes.  When you play 20-something weeks a year, you're not going to feel great every day.  So it was just nice to feel healthy this week.
