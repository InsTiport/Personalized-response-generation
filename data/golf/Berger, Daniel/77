 Q.   Talk about your run there.   You got yourself right into the middle of it.   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I mean, hit a really nice bunker shot on 17 in the third round, and holed that from what was looking like a bogey or double, and came away with a birdie there.   So that was very nice.   Then just hitting it well and making some putts and just keep grinding.  
   
 Q.   This has got to be almost like surreal for you, the way you're playing out here.     
DANIEL BERGER:   I put a lot of work in leading up to this week, so it's not anything I wasn't expecting.   It's just saying patient and staying in the moment.  
   
 Q.   Over the last month, you've been really on top of your game.   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I think it all comes from what I do before I get here, and the time I put in and it's good work and it pays off, and it feels good when stuff like that happens.  
   
 Q.   So mind‑set going into tomorrow?   
DANIEL BERGER:   It's going to be a little seven‑hole match for myself, and just stay patient and give myself some birdie chances and not think about it too much.
