Q. What's it take to shoot a 2-under today out there?
DANIEL BERGER: Honestly, this is probably the toughest round we have played all year, in my opinion.
The course is playing so long.  I hit more 4-irons and 5-irons into greens today than I have all year.  But it was great to kind of finish strong after kind of a weak front nine.
Q. Was that last nine, was that among nine of your best on TOUR this year?
DANIEL BERGER: It had to have been nine of my best holes on TOUR this year.  You hit a great drive and, you got 5-iron in.  If you don't hit a great drive, you're not getting on the green.
So it's really about placement off the tee and if you can do that, then you can make a couple birdies.
Q. So what were you thinking, you had a bogey on 11, and then you went on that roll.  What really got you going?
DANIEL BERGER: Honestly, I just kind of -- I got really mad at myself.  I was like you got to do something here different, because I really want to get inside that top-10 FedExCup this year.
So I'm just doing my best to hang in there and see what happens tomorrow.
