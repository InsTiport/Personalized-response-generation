 Q.   Great start highlighted by that finish, four birdies in the last five.   Talk us through the round?  
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I just kind of stayed patient throughout the round and hit some good shots coming down the stretch and made a few birdies.   I feel like I'm starting to play well now, so it's nice to get off to a good start.  
   
 Q.   You talk about playing well, tell me about the conditions this morning.   Maybe not as warm, did that lend itself to the low scoring we're seeing out there?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, especially with ball‑in‑hand it's made it a little bit easier, but the course is in great shape.   I expect it to be great for the rest of the week.   It's just a great layout.   It kind of reminds me of where I grew up down in Florida, and I just feel comfortable out here.  
   
 Q.   I was watching you play well, and you played so well at the Honda too.   Many of the holes resemble what you see down there in South Florida?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, a lot of the holes are the same kind of shapes, a lot of water on one side of the hole.   You've just got to pick your targets and hit some good shots.  
   
 Q.   Any a key stretch of holes out there?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I think coming down the stretch, 16, 17, 18, if you can get a birdie on 18 and just kind of hang in there on 17 you're going to be doing well.  
   
 Q.   66, right?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Birdies on four of his final five holes and in at 6‑under par here on Thursday.   Daniel, how pleased are you with your start?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I'm really excited to get off to a good start in the first round, and it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   When you have a finish like that, maybe a little indifferent through the first 13, 14 holes, what clicked and how did that momentum carry you?   
DANIEL BERGER:   I think I was just real patient throughout the round and hit some good shots coming down the stretch and made some putts.   I think this course you've just got to hang in there, and there are birdie chances out there.  
   
 Q.   When you see a place for the first time teeing up at a new event for you as a rookie here on the PGA TOUR, how does this place suit your eye and fit your game with what you try to accomplish?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, like I was saying earlier, I think the fact that it kind of reminds me of a Florida‑style golf course, so I'm used to kind of seeing water on one side of the hole.   You've just got to pick your targets and get good shots.   If you can do that, you'll be all set.  
   
 Q.   Great day for you today.   You grew up in Florida, so you're used to this kind of heat and humidity.   Do you like it like this?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I feel like it's in my comfort zone out here.   Hopefully the rain stays away and you can get four good days of golf in.  
   
 Q.   You said this course reminds you of back home.   What about it reminds you?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, it reminds me of my home course.   You look at 18 where you have water running down the right.   There are a lot of holes out there that have the same kind of shape.   You've really got to be patient out there because you can get upset and frustrated really quick if you're not.  
   
 Q.   The fairways are kind of still pretty soft.   So your second year pro shot is obviously important for the greens.   Did you feel you were able to take aim at the flag still?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, I think there are some tough pins out there, but I think you've got to attack the par‑5s and play the par‑5s well, and if you do that, you'll be all set.  
   
 Q.   I think you're a rookie this year; is that right?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   How is it going so far?   Are you getting a feel for the TOUR now?   
DANIEL BERGER:   Yeah, it's been great so far.   I've met a lot of really nice guys, and this is, obviously, a dream come true, so I've got to do everything I can to stay out here.
