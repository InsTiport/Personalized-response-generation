Q. Is the course a little more scorable today?DANIEL BERGER: If you hit it in the right spots, it is.  But U.S. Opens are tough and the biggest key is hitting greens. Today I hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of opportunities, and when you do that you're bound to make some birdies.
Q. Did it help that you were out early?DANIEL BERGER: I played yesterday at 12:30 and there wasn't that noticeable a difference.  It was a little softer.  Just going out there -- I got a little practice in before my round yesterday, and today my speed was great all day.  I had a lot of opportunities and I made some putts.
Q. Was your drive at 14 your only mistake?DANIEL BERGER: Honestly, yeah, that was the only mistake.  I hit a lot of quality golf shots.  At 14, I probably should have hit driver.  I hit driver the last two days, so I played a little conservative there, but I'm proud of the way I fought today.
Q. What was up with your caddie handing off your bag to your dad coming up 18?DANIEL BERGER: That wasn't planned.  I just got down the fairway, and my caddie Sam said he's going off to the side.  It was pretty cool on Father's Day Sunday, dad being here.  He doesn't get to go to a lot of tournaments.  He travels a lot, so for my first U.S. Open, it was a great experience.
Q. What did you do?DANIEL BERGER: I just gave him a big hug.  He's done a lot for me, so it's a great feeling.
Q. What does this do for your confidence as you head back to the web.com TOUR?DANIEL BERGER: When you play on such a big stage as this, the web.com doesn't feel as big.  But, obviously, I got to kind of shift my focus back to web.com, have a couple of good weeks, and if all goes well, I'll be out here next year.
