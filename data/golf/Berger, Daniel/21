 Q.  Daniel, 4-under par 66, if we can get some comments on your day.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, overall fantastic. I played really great from the start, hit a lot of really good drives, which was important to be in the fairway today. But just hung in there.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about the atmosphere without fans here today.  
DANIEL BERGER: You know, it kind of felt like being at home playing with the guys, in a big money game, obviously, a lot more on the line. But just really excited to be playing great golf and keep continuing the momentum that I've had before the break.   
 Q.  How important was it for you to get off to a good start here with the return to golf?  
DANIEL BERGER: You know, it's important to play well whenever you get the opportunity to play. I worked really hard in the time off, and it's nice to come back and fire off a few low rounds early in the restart and get going for the rest of the season.   
 Q.  Just talk a little bit about what we can see here coming down the stretch with these last couple groups?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I think we just saw Collin hit a really close one. I mean, he's a great player. We'll see if he knocks it in or not.
