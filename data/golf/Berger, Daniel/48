DANIEL BERGER: It's been pretty good so far today.  I got off to a not so great start and putted it really well and had a bunch of birdies and had four in a row on the back nine to close out a good day.
Q. Elaborate on four in a row, because that was pretty special when you were drifting a little.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I kind of fell back with the bogey on 12.  Just tried to hit as many balls as close as I could to the flag, and made a few putts.
Q. Is that a matter of telling yourself:  I've got to do something here to stay involved?
DANIEL BERGER: I think a little bit.  And part of it is trying to keep expectations down and just trying to have some fun and keep doing the same thing I've been doing the next day.
Q. There are still plenty of opportunities; the weather is so changeable and cold.  But, you still, once you get to the green, there are chances, aren't there?
DANIEL BERGER: There are.  Today it seemed like it started off really windy and kind of calmed down a little bit on the back nine towards the end.  Just got to take advantage of the opportunities that you have.
Q. I know only time will tell, but that last hole could be critical, as well, getting something out of it.
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, if you hit a good drive, you can go for it in two.  You've just got to hang in there and hopefully it comes down to the last hole.
Q. We can't say for certain yet, but looks like you're in the final group.  Going to enjoy that experience?
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I love the opportunity.  I think for me, it's more fun to kind of play with the guy that's leading and try to put some pressure on him.
Q. Does it change your attitude?
DANIEL BERGER: No, just go and do the same thing I've been doing.
