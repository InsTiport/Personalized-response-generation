 Q.  So much good, positive stuff that you can take out of the week, and particularly the final day.  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, I played great today.  I made a lot of putts.  Hideki played just unbelievable and it was a pleasure to watch.  You can learn a lot from watching Hideki play.   
 Q.  Elaborate on that, because he's won by a country mile.  So just how well has he struck that ball?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, he's struck it well.  He's putted well.  He's chipped it well.  He's done everything well and that's why he's won by so many.   
 Q.  And it really does set you up, doesn't it?  
DANIEL BERGER: Yeah, it does.  Just got to go enjoy the rest of the year and have a little time off and enjoy it.
