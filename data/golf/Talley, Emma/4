 Q.  How long of a ways does a round like that go?  
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, I think mentally it's better than anything because the game felt really good the first day. It was really consistent.   
And then yesterday I kind of just didn't hit it as well or putt very well really, and I still shot even, which I was really pleased with.   
Then me and my caddie kind of figured out what I was doing on my putting, and today I putted great. Yeah, I'm pretty confident going into the last five rounds.   
 Q.  How excited are you for the halfway point?  
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, mean, I think it's such a grind and a marathon. You can't get too excited or too high or low, so I'm just trying to stick with the process and keep doing my drills and the same thing every day and not get too high or low.
