EMMA TALLEY: It was a rough day.  My driver felt off, my putter felt off.  I missed a couple three-footers, so I left a lot of strokes out there.  But good thing is we have 18 more holes, and I'm excited about tomorrow.
Q. Speaking of that, obviously, you're still in a good spot for tomorrow.  You must be happy looking forward to that.
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, the past two weeks I put myself in contention, which is exactly what you want to do each week.  So I'm really happy with being up here, in contention, like I said.  So hopefully I can keep doing that.
Q. Do you like the way the course is playing now?  Has it taught you the possibility of maybe some moisture in the mornings, precipitation?
EMMA TALLEY: No, I like the way the course is playing.  It's really good.  The greens are firm in the afternoon.  The course is hard, but it's tight, and yeah, everything looks good right now.  So hopefully it won't change too much.
Q. What do you think about hearing all of these War Eagle when you go to Alabama?  You're in Buckeye territory?
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, they're just jealous they're not Alabama faithful, so Roll Tide (laughing).
Q. So what aspects of your game did work well?
EMMA TALLEY: I think I just scrambled pretty well.  Like I said, I didn't feel really good about my game today, so it was kind of a bummer.  But I've been feeling good for the past week with my game, so hopefully it just comes back tomorrow.
