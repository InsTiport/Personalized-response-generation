Q. We talked about it yesterday obviously, but for our purposes for notes today, just how much of a blessing in disguise do you think Q-Series is for you?
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, I mean, I was nervous all day. I haven't been playing well this year, so to come out and really play steady - like I hit 16 greens and the only bogey I had was a 30-foot bogey on the last.
Yeah, I think that kind of gets me off to good start. Like I said, I think this is just the beginning of something better come hopefully.
