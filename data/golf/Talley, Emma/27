 Q.   The leading amateur and a round of 73, what sense of achievement do you feel with that today?   
EMMA TALLEY:   Yes, going into the week all I wanted to do was play well.   I don't know how the weather was going to work out for me and thankfully I had the first few days pretty good.   So it's very exciting.   Making the cut was great and now being the top amateur was even better.  
   
 Q.   These conditions, not quite what you're used to.   
EMMA TALLEY:   Not at all but I've had a little bit of experience.   I played here a couple years ago.   I was a little nervous, but I knew Georgia was up on me for sure.   Just wanted to play well, hit the middle of the greens and that's it.   
   
 Q.   It's been quite a summer for you, you holed the winning putt to win back the Curtis Cup for America and here you are as the leading U.S. Amateur here and beat the leading amateur and you had your dad on the bag today.   How special was that?  
EMMA TALLEY:   It was very special.   Last year we got to experience together winning the U.S. Am together so he's very good at caddying for me.   Keeps me calm and kind of feels like we are just playing at home for fun, which is good for me.   It's kind of funny that Georgia, we played against each other at the Curtis Cup, so it was kind of interesting to play against her again.   Didn't think we would.  
   
 Q.   What are your plans now?   Is professionalism around the corner for you?  
EMMA TALLEY:   No, I want to finish school.   I have two more years of school and hopefully after that, pro.
