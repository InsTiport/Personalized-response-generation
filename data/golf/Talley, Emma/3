 Q.  What made this week successful?  
EMMA TALLEY: I think just being patient and sticking with the process. Yeah, that's it. (Laughter.)   
And a lot hard work the last two weeks.   
 Q.  Leading up to it?  
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah.   
 Q.  What's the approach now as we switch courses? With where you are on the leaderboard, does everything kind of transition a little bit?  
EMMA TALLEY: Well, the good and bad thing, my goal was not to shoot over par in two weeks, and I just made bogey on the last one to shoot 1-over.   
So it kind of is probably a good thing because I'm a little mad, which I shouldn't be. In the grand scheme of things I'm in a great position going into next week.   
Now I feel like I have something to work on a little bit and just prepare a little bit for next week. Take a day off and start it all over again. It's a marathon.
