 Q.  I think career-best finish.  
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah.   
 Q.  Talk about what it means to have two top 10s this early in your rookie season in terms of feeling like you can relax a little maybe.  
EMMA TALLEY: Yeah, for sure.  I felt really good about my game this week finally.  I have a set caddie now, so that feels nice.  Just feels like everything is kind of coming together.   
Really happy with the start.  Hopefully this will continue.  Hopefully I can keep my game rolling like it is now.   
 Q.  What was the best part of your game this week?  
EMMA TALLEY: I would say probably my iron game.  I hit the ball really well all week.  My putting was off in the middle, Friday, Saturday, but it was really good first day and today.   
Yeah, hit the ball really well.  I haven't been, so that was nice.   
 Q.  Jeremy is a veteran caddie out here.  
EMMA TALLEY: He's great.   
 Q.  How do you two...  
EMMA TALLEY: He's great.  He's really smart.  There have been several shots where I'm like, I don't think he's right, but I trust him, and it's been great.   
He's been really good.  I have a lot of trust in him already after two weeks, so really happy for -- I'm really glad he's caddying for me.  Most guys probably wouldn't do that for a rookie.   
I'm very happy to have him.   
 Q.  What are your big goals or little for your first year on tour?  
EMMA TALLEY: I had a lot of the goals.  I have everything from getting my par-5 percentage down to winning a tournament to -- I have all kinds of goals.   
So just sticking with the process and see where it goes.
