Q. Just tell me about your round.EMMA TALLEY: It started off a little rough, but I knew that cards were going to be good out there, so I just kept on grinding and ended well.Q. Which holes were you most comfortable on?EMMA TALLEY: I don't know.  For some reason I was a little nervous at the beginning today.  I usually don't have that.  But I guess at the U.S. Open you have some butterflies.  There were a few holes out there.  I was hitting my irons really well today, putting really well.  So I think over my putter I felt pretty good over it
