 Q.  Talk about your overall experience at the U.S. Open and how you felt it went as a whole.  EMMA TALLEY: This is my fourth Open and I played really well the first two days.  The past two days I've been off my game, but that happens.  I'm just glad I made the cut and I was able to play with the best players in the world.  Another experience under my belt for sure.   Q.  What can you take away from this and learn for future tournaments?  EMMA TALLEY: It's just the same thing, you work hard and you come out here and play your best shot.  I did a great job getting up-and-down today, even though my score was pretty high, it could have been a lot worse. Like I say it's just another experience.  Next time I come here, I'll be more comfortable and I'll learn something else and definitely going to benefit my career.   Q.  What did you think about hole 16 today?  The tee is moved up.  It's a little risk-reward there and definitely a birdie hole today?  EMMA TALLEY: My only birdie today, so I liked it
