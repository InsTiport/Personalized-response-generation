  Q. Very nice round today. Looking back on your year, how did that tied-for-second finish in Mexico treat you?  
 BRIAN STUARD: I learned a lot, I think. Just you gotta be patient out here and take advantage of your chances when you get them.   
  
  Q. Can you translate some of that into your round today, and if so, how?  
 BRIAN STUARD: I don't know. I've been struggling quite a bit. I worked on my swing with my teacher back home on Monday, and something seemed to click a little bit, so we'll see.  
  
  Q. You had that runner-up finish. You obviously say things are starting to click a little bit. What's your strategy now for the next couple rounds?  
 BRIAN STUARD: I don't know. I'm going to just try to keep doing what I did today.   
 Haven't been playing very well, but like I said, just going to try to build on today.  
  
  Q. Good luck.   
 BRIAN STUARD: Thank you. Appreciate it.
