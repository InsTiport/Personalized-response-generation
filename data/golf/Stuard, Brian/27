 Q.   How did do you on 17?   
BRIAN STUARD:   I did okay.   I hit the green, so that's good.  
   
 Q.   That's always the goal there.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   What are your expectations for this week and how do you think you'll do?   
BRIAN STUARD:   You know, I think I'm just going to try to approach it as another tournament and see what happens.   Just try to play, be patient, and hopefully play some good golf.  
   
 Q.   So have you been out with any of the caddie competitions yet?   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, my caddie didn't hit the green.   He had a little water shot there, but that's all right.  
   
 Q.   Are there a little bit of bragging rights in there between players?   
BRIAN STUARD:   Not too much.   I think it's more between the caddies.  
   
 Q.   Couple quick ones.   Just comment on being here at THE PLAYERS for the first time.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, it's been great.   It's exciting.   You know, this is where you want to be, so this is pretty cool.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little about your season up to this point.   
BRIAN STUARD:   I started off the season pretty well.   I had some good tournaments.   Last probably month or so I haven't played as well, but hopefully we can get it turned around this week.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little about what would be going through your head on Sunday if you're coming down to that three‑hole stretch with the lead.   
BRIAN STUARD:   You know, it would just be a good position to be in.   That would be fun.   I'd just try to hit each shot as best you can and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Had you played the course before this week?   
BRIAN STUARD:   I played it when they had the Web.com on the other course.   I played the Pro‑Am on the Stadium Course.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on No. 17 and how you did the first time you played that hole?   
BRIAN STUARD:   It was good.   I guess it kind of is everything you expect it to be.   Been doing all right.   I hit the greens, so it's good.
