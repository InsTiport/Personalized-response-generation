 Q.  A little something in the swing.  Are you going to share that with us?  BRIAN STUARD: I think it's just kind of going back to basics.  Just worked on my set-up a little bit and just kind of went back to what I felt comfortable with.   Q.  And the golf course, how is it playing?  BRIAN STUARD: It's playing really good.  If you're hitting it well, you can make some birdies, the greens are great.  The course is really nice.   Q.  6-under, looking at your stats I said, 25 putts.  That's pretty good stuff.  I said, what clicked for you?  And you said?  BRIAN STUARD: Who knows, right.  It's just one of those things where I felt like I was reading them well and hitting my lines and had a few long ones which is nice.   Q.  For you, what is the key from tee to green on this course to be able to set yourself up for a nice putting day?  BRIAN STUARD: I think the course, if you drive it on the fairway, then you're going to have some good opportunities.  I didn't drive it great today, but I was able to take advantage of a couple of them.  I think, like I said, if I drive it on the fairway, I think I'll be all right.   Q.  All day, all week actually, we'll be on the 15th hole for our Live@ coverage.  If you can take me through that hole, how it can be a challenge and how you can make it easy?  BRIAN STUARD: It's all set up by the drive.  It's where the pin's at.  If you hit your drive in the right spot, then it can be an easy hole.  But I think tomorrow the pin's going to be on the front right.  So if you hit it short right or anywhere to the right, it's going to be a tough up and down.
