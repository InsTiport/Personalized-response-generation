Q. Six threes in a row on the backside.  Talk me through that one?BRIAN STUARD: Yeah, that was nice.  Just kind of got into a nice rhythm and hit some good shots and made the putts, so it was nice.Q. Coming in here, you're not in the best of form.  You had a really good start to the year.  What's been the catalyst this week?BRIAN STUARD: I don't know, I think today was just one of those days where I just kind of got everything going.  I didn't really play that great the first two days, just kind of hung in there.  And today I felt like I made some birdies.  Hit a lot of nice shots.Q. And course conditions change much?BRIAN STUARD: I think it was a little softer than it was yesterday afternoon.  But it's still pretty firm and the ball was running out in the fairway quite a bit.  Yeah, it was good.
