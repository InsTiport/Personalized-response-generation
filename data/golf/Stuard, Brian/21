 Q.   Brian, good round of golf.   You're leading the tournament right now.   How are you feeling?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Thanks, pretty good.   Yeah, it's just a nice round of golf.   I got off to a good start, which was nice, and then kind of didn't play quite as well on the back.   But putted really good today, so that was nice.   
   
 Q.   Tell me a little bit about the course.   How is it feeling?  
BRIAN STUARD:   It's good.   Wind is blowing pretty good out there, so got to hit some good shots.   I did well‑‑ I kept it in play nice off the tee, didn't get in much trouble, and only made the one bogey on No.7.   Played pretty good.   It was nice.   
   
 Q.   You have the highest FedExCup ranking out of the whole field here.   That means you've had a pretty good 2013‑2014 season.   You've had four top 10 finishes so far.   Tell us a little bit about your game and what's going on.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I got off to a really good start.   I finished second in MÃ©xico and kind of‑‑ I don't know, I've just been playing pretty solid, I guess, but been putting well.   I putted really good to start off the year and then kind of last few weeks not quite as good and then good today.   So hopefully it continues.   
   
 Q.   So the big factor here on this course especially is wind.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   How did that treat you today?  
BRIAN STUARD:   It was good.   I did a nice job with the clubs.   You kind of‑‑ it's just one of those places where you try to‑‑ if you've got a hard into the wind or cross‑wind shot, you just try to give it a little extra and play to the safe side, I guess.   
   
 Q.   Last question is Puerto Rico; beautiful island, a little warm here.   Tell us how you're feeling here.   
BRIAN STUARD:   It's good.   I like it when it's nice and warm, I guess.   I don't know, I seem to play well in these kind of conditions.   I'm looking forward to the next couple days.
