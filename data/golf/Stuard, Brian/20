 Q.   Brian, 67, bogey‑free.   Talk about the golf course conditions out there.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, it was a good round.   Played pretty solid.   The course is a little softer this year compared to last year.   So I feel like you can make a few birdies if you hit some good shots.   
   
 Q.   What was going right for you?  
BRIAN STUARD:   I putted well.   I didn't take advantage of the par‑5s, but I putted really nice and made a couple good par saves on 2 and‑‑ 1 and 2, to start the day.   So that was kind of nice to get the momentum going.   
   
 Q.   A little wind this morning, did you think you took advantage?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, there was not much probably for the first 12 or so holes.   Then it picked up in the last six, but, yeah, it was out there for the taking.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
BRIAN STUARD:   It was good.   The greens were pretty fast, a little faster than they have been for the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, so it was nice to get out there and feel like I could make some putts.  
   
 Q.   How do you keep this going?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Hopefully just kind of keep doing what I'm doing.   I've been driving it pretty well, I drove it well today, hopefully I can take advantage of the par‑5s tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Anything new or different this season?   Anything different this year?  
BRIAN STUARD:   I don't know.   Good question.   I'm putting pretty consistent, so that's kind of making up for a lot of bad things, I guess.   So I feel like I'm putting well.   
   
 Q.   Did you change anything?  
BRIAN STUARD:   I don't know.   I think it's a confidence thing.   I changed putters last fall and for whatever reason it just has been clicking.   So it's been nice.
