 Q.  Those last three holes, enough to tell the story, big finish to give yourselves a chance going into Sunday?  
BRIAN STUARD: Yeah, we toughed it out today.  We didn't have our best stuff but we made three good putts on 16, 17 and 18 to keep us in it.   
 Q.  That shot of Brian's on 16, a chance for birdie, you point back at him and he makes the gutsy par save out of your shot on 17 and vice versa on 18.  How proud are you two of this performance, the way you've given yourselves this opportunity?  
CHRIS STROUD: I think we are an amazing team.  He just seems to, when I miss a shot, put him in bad positions, he seems to hit some amazing shots, or he makes some amazing putts, and same thing for me.   
I put him in some pretty bad positions today.  He hit some awesome shots.  The shot on 16 is the shot of the day.  He had no shot.  He had a hook-wedge out of the rough, over trees into the wind by the water to six feet and made birdie.  So that was a huge swing.
