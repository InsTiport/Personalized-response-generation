 Q.  What a sprint to the finish line for you guys.  You got on a little roll there coming in with three birdies in a row.  Nice way to finish it, eh, Russell?  
RUSSELL KNOX: No, absolutely.  We played very well.  Brian got off to a flying start on the front nine, which was great, and we went on a little par streak in the middle there, but to finish with a few birdies makes lunch taste good.   
 Q.  Brian, how is the golf course playing after we had almost three inches of rain 24 hours ago?  
BRIAN STUARD: I think it's very good.  It's a little wet in spots, but you can hardly tell it rained so much.   
 Q.  Totally different strategy or totally different game when you're playing alternate-shot foursomes this afternoon.  What is you guys' strategy.  Russell?  
RUSSELL KNOX: We have no idea yet.  We're going to sit down and -- in previous years we've both teed off on the same holes, so one of us is going to have to do a little different this afternoon.  But it doesn't matter.  Good shots, doesn't matter who it is.
