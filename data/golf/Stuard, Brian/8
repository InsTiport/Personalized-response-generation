Q. Little bit of a disappointing finish but talk about your round overall.
BRIAN STUARD: Played pretty solid.  Just kind of -- just got a little to the right on my drive on 9 and couldn't make par.  But, pretty good.
Q. Weather conditions are pretty good out there.  Was the course ripe for scoring today?
BRIAN STUARD: Yeah, I think.  Very little wind and the greens are as smooth as can be.  So, got to make some birdies today.
Q. This is very familiar kind of weather to New Orleans where you picked up your first win this year.  Think that plays to your advantage?
BRIAN STUARD: You know, I don't know.  Seems to be I like playing in the warm weather for sure and, you know, I guess I like these bermuda greens.  I don't know.  Something about it.
Q. How is life on the PGA TOUR since your first win?
BRIAN STUARD: It's pretty good.  You know, it's always been good but I think it's a little more special now.
