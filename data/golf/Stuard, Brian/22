 Q.   Rocky start, but you battled back and at 9‑under you're still in it.   A few thoughts about the day?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, it was pretty crummy.   I didn't play very good.   Hit it pretty bad, and then, like you said, I played a little better on the back, so hopefully it gives me a little momentum for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything when you start that bad that sort of turned you around or were you sort of hanging in there mentally?   Do you take something positive away when you do that?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I think so.   I think I could have let it slip away, shot 5, 6‑over pretty easily, and made some nice sand saves and some nice up‑and‑downs to kind of keep me in it.  
   
 Q.   Was it just the driver was not‑‑ if you don't hit it straight here, it's trouble.   
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I wasn't hitting it very good off the tee, and then irons weren't that great.   Just kind of one of those days, I guess.   
   
 Q.   But you're three shots, you're going to start, and what's your strategy tomorrow?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Hopefully play like I did the first two days.   Kind of get this out of my system and go from there.
