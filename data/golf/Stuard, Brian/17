Q.   So good round today.   What are your thoughts overall about this golf course? 
BRIAN STUARD:   I think the golf course is good.   Gotta drive it good, and then if you hit the fairways, then you're going to have some chances to make birdies, so I think you gotta drive it good.

Q.   What particularly did you do well today?
BRIAN STUARD:   I putted pretty well, drove it pretty nicely, just missed a couple of fairways, and hit my irons pretty good.   I just played pretty good overall.

Q.   You'd say the keys are the fairways here do you feel?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I think so.   If you hit the fairway off the tee, then you're going to have a good chance to get a shot close, but if you miss the fairway, the rough's long and it's thick, so it's hard to play from the rough.

Q.   How have you felt coming into the week?   Confident, belief?   How is that?
BRIAN STUARD:   I haven't played very well to start with.   I've played a couple good rounds and then I'll have a bad round here, so I'm excited to play well to start with and hopefully I can keep it going.
