  THE MODERATOR:   We welcome Brian Stuard into the interview room this afternoon, a nice eagle at the last hole today and you shoot 65 for the fourth consecutive time here at Waialae, and now you've got the lead.   Just some thoughts about your overall play today.
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I played pretty well.   Didn't start off very good, but I played pretty good on my last nine, the front nine. 
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Can you just take us through the round, any highlights, any long putts, and obviously we need details on the last hole.
BRIAN STUARD:   I made a nice par putt at 12 that kind of kept the momentum going. 
15, I made like a 15‑footer for birdie. 
18, made like a 10‑footer. 
5, I made‑‑ I'm trying to think, like five, six feet, and then made like a 15‑footer on 6.   And then on 9 I had 213 hole and just kind of hit a really nice shot to a couple feet. 
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   What club? 
BRIAN STUARD:   That was a 3 hybrid. 
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   I also looked it up, you've had seven straight rounds in the 60s at Waialae, including the four straight 65s.   Anything about this course? 
BRIAN STUARD:   I don't know, I've been trying to figure it out.   I think it's something to do with the greens.   I feel comfortable on the greens.   I feel like I read them pretty well and feel like I'm able to make some putts. 

Q.   Looking at some of your results, do you think this is the most comfortable course you have played out here on TOUR? 
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, it kind of seems that way.   I enjoy the layout.   It's nice to have to hit some shots off the tee, and I enjoy doing that.   And like I said, something about the greens that I feel good about. 

Q.   For people who haven't seen you play a ton, what kind of shot shape do you play?   What kind of style is your play?   Are you a draw player?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, usually‑‑ when I'm playing well and feel comfortable, I usually hit a draw.   It sets up nice.   There's a lot of tee shots where a draw seems to be the shot. 

Q.   That shot on 9, did that have a chance of going in?
BRIAN STUARD:   No, it was a couple feet left. 

Q.   A lot of people yesterday talked about how the fairways were hard and so it was difficult to keep the ball in there, and how tough it was to read the greens, and based on how close you hit the ball, it doesn't sound like you had trouble with either of those things?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I don't know.   Like I said, it's something about the layout where I feel good about it on each tee shot.   I don't know, the greens, I don't know.   I just feel like I can read them well.   Just one of those things, I guess. 

Q.   Have all your 65s kind of been similar to this? 
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I would say so. 

Q.   Hitting it close?
BRIAN STUARD:   I guess.   I don't know.   Am I hitting it close?   It seems like today it felt like when I hit a good shot, it was pretty close.   I didn't play very good on the back nine today, my first nine.   Didn't hit very many fairways and kind of scrambled around pretty well.   But then on the front I played pretty well.   I don't know.

Q.   So are you playing well here because the weather is so similar to Michigan?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I think so, just like this.   I don't know, I think on Monday and Tuesday it was like ‑50 wind chill there, so this is pretty nice. 

Q.   Do you live in Michigan still?
BRIAN STUARD:   I usually spend the winters in Florida.

Q.   What part?
BRIAN STUARD:   Fort Lauderdale.

Q.   You had another high finish in the fall before the break here.   Have you changed anything in your swing or what feels really comfortable for you right now?
BRIAN STUARD:   That's a good question.   I don't know.   I played well in MÃ©xico, and it's kind of similar to this, Bermuda greens, and I don't know, I guess I feel good on the Bermuda or whatever. 

Q.   The other courses you've played well on like Greenbrier and some of those are more old‑school golf courses like this, as well.   Is that something you feel more comfortable on?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I enjoy playing that.   Like I said, it's kind of fun to have to hit a shot into the fairway instead of just let it rip, so I don't know. 

Q.   You may have gone through this yesterday, but can you talk about what you did leading up to coming here to play? 
BRIAN STUARD:   I played in MÃ©xico.   That was the last one in the fall.   And then I took probably about, I don't know, a month off.   I didn't do anything.   Then just kind of been practicing for about a week and a half prior to coming here.   Not much, really.   I don't know.   Maybe that's a good thing. 

Q.   First time you played out here, was it love at first sight?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, this was my first‑ever PGA TOUR event, and I think I finished 25th or something.   It was just kind of‑‑ I don't know, something about it, I guess.   I enjoy coming here.

Q.   First time you walked out here and saw the course and played it, did you just feel comfortable?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I think you feel‑‑ when you play somewhere that you enjoy, I think you feel comfortable everywhere on every tee shot, and for the most part I feel like on every tee shot I kind of have a good plan, a good way to play it, I guess.

Q.   The first time you came out here two years ago when you saw the course, did you just kind of settle right in, feel this was really good for you?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah.   I don't know, like we were talking about, it's kind of an old‑style golf course, and I guess that kind of‑‑ I don't know, for whatever reason I enjoy playing that. 

Q.   So there was no thought that this year you would start somewhere else; you were definitely coming back here to start?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I think so.   Like I said, this is pretty tough to come here and take this.   It's pretty nice. 

Q.   How long did it take you to make it through the line to start here?
BRIAN STUARD:   It was just kind of always going to be the case, I guess.   It didn't really take long. 
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Good playing, Brian.
