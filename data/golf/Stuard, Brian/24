 Q.   Well played out there today, eight birdies.   A couple bogeys on the back.   Was it a little tougher on the back nine today?  
BRIAN STUARD:   I don't know, I just kind of hit a couple tee shots and hit into some bunkers and then hit into more bunkers and couldn't get them up‑and‑down.  
   
 Q.   What was the key to your round out there?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Getting off to a good start is always nice.   Hitting that first fairway is always good out here, and I putted pretty good.  
   
 Q.   You had a second place finish down in Mayakoba.   Two‑month break but it seems like the momentum has carried over?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, I don't know, I've got some good vibes here.   I enjoy it here.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   What did you do in that two‑month break?   
BRIAN STUARD:   Not a lot of golf.   Just kind of took a little time off and just relaxed.  
   
 Q.   Any highlights in the round?   Anything that sort of kept it going?  
BRIAN STUARD:   I played really good on the front, and then I made bogey on 8, and then I came back and made birdie on 9, which kind of kept things going, and then I did that again back on the back, bogeyed 13 and then came back and birdied 14.   Just kind of a couple bounce‑back birdies were pretty nice.  
   
 Q.   No real long putts?  
BRIAN STUARD:   Not too long.   I made‑‑ on the second hole I made maybe like a 20‑footer.   That's probably about it, I think.
