Q.   What was going good this morning?
BRIAN STUARD:   Played pretty solid.   I hit it great off the tee.   I hit my irons pretty good.   And I didn't putt great.   I made a couple, but I missed quite a few tees. 
Overall I'm pretty pleased.   I've been working on a few things, so it's kind of nice to see it pay off.

Q.   And the conditions were almost perfect this morning, right?
BRIAN STUARD:   Can't beat it.

Q.   There's a little wind now, did you have any wind at all out there?
BRIAN STUARD:   It seemed like we had a little bit maybe in the middle of our round and then it died back down.   Yeah, not much.

Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow, just keeping the same thing going?
BRIAN STUARD:   Yeah, you know, I feel like if I can drive it well off the tee here, it sets up well for my game.   I'm excited about it.

Q.   I didn't see your record, how have you been playing coming into this week?
BRIAN STUARD:   Not very good. 

Q.   How recently have you been working on these changes you were referring to?
BRIAN STUARD:   Pretty much‑‑ I mean, I've been working on it for a long time, but this week I've really tried to focus on changing a couple of things in my swing and it paid off today.   So see if it continues.
