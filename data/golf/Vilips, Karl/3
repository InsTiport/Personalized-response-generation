Q. So he jumped on you early.
KARL VILIPS: Yes.
Q. And that was difficult to get back in it?
KARL VILIPS: Yeah, came out and birdied the first hole, which I don't think anyone else did.
He hit like driver, like long 3-iron in.  I mean, I just hit a few poor shots on the front side.  But, I mean, that front side just didn't go the way I planned.  Like 2-down through 9, and I was only even or 1-over something like that.
And then I tried turn things around on the back.  I did for a little bit.
Q. Birdied 11.
KARL VILIPS: Birdied 11.
Made a great par on 12.
And then he made the 30-footer on 13.  Yeah, just couldn't get back in it after that.
Q. So he always had an answer today?
KARL VILIPS: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he shot 5-under on his own ball.  I mean, that will win every match out here.
Considering I shot even or 1-under on my own ball, that would win most matches out here, too.
Tough break with the draw, but it's whatever.
Q. What do you take away from this whole experience?  As you've said, you played in two Amateurs, but this was your first junior.
KARL VILIPS: Yeah sure the Junior is good, everything is good.  I think it's good to learn to never underestimate your opponent.  I mean, I had people telling me things about Thomas before the round, and I just tried to block it all out and tried to treat him the same.  I did, and he surprised me.  I'll give him that.
I think it's also good to get the experience of just match play in.  You don't really play many tournaments with individual matches.  Wyndham Cup is best ball an stuff, but individual matches are different.
Q. What's next for you?
KARL VILIPS: Wyndham Cup.  It's on Sunday.
Q. Is there a qualifier for the Amateur?
KARL VILIPS: I'm probably not going to play the Amateur this year.
Q. Okay.
KARL VILIPS: Yeah, I needed a good week this week to be exempt and didn't have a good week.
Q. And college starts soon?
KARL VILIPS: 2020, so September 2020.
Q. Okay.
KARL VILIPS: Yeah.
Q. Good luck.
KARL VILIPS: Thank you.
