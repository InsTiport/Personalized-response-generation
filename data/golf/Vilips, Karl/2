 Q.  First U.S. Amateur, Pinehurst, tough course, had a rough start, but you came back with three birdies.  What led to that comeback?  
KARL VILIPS: Just kind of got aggressive and made a few putts and then it's a shame that I really choked the last couple holes, but hopefully we can keep that same energy we had on the front nine and bring it through to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Going into No. 4, it's a little easier course, all the Pinehurst courses are tough though, what do you think about the Pinehurst courses in general?  
KARL VILIPS: I mean, they are tough, but they're also fair.  You have to hit good shots.  Greens are tricky to read.  You just really got to put the ball in the fairway, which is what I struggled with today.
