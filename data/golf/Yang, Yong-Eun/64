   Y.E. YANG: My first time playing with him, so I'll try not to go over par.

 Q. Is it something you look forward to? Are you nervous? Excited?
 Y.E. YANG: Nervous, but I've been looking forward to it. And I've thought about this, playing with Tiger recently, and it came true so fast.

 Q. Do you expect this to affect your game at all? You're playing very well. Do you think you match up well with him? 
 Y.E. YANG: Well, if I could concentrate and keep my flow, you know, not get caught up in all the rhythm and just keep playing the game, I think I'll be fine.

 Q. What would it be like to play in front of that large of a crowd and sort of the stuff that goes along with playing with Tiger with tons of people moving around?
 Y.E. YANG: It will be a big crowd. And definitely it will be more energy and stuff like that, but I'll try to concentrate and do my best.

 Q. Do you expect a lot of people from home watching now?
 Y.E. YANG: It's one of the last majors, and back in Korea it will be early morning broadcast. So I think a lot of the golf fans will tune in, watch.
