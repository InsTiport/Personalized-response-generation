 Q. A couple quick comments about the round, obviously the wind was a major factor today. 
 Y.E. YANG: The good thing about having a late tee off time today, you can actually look at the scores and determine how you're going to play and what you're aiming at, what score you're aiming at. 
 So I thought probably just breaking even would be good in these conditions and I played like that, and I played conservative, tried to play even, tried to par. And it worked out quite well. A few holes I got lucky and ended up under par.

 Q. Obviously this is a very significant tournament; how does it feel to be back here and recapture some of the magic? 
 Y.E. YANG: The golf course, the tournament, it's mixed feelings really. It gave me my first PGA win, but I have some bad memories, as well, because last year when I was defending I missed the cut. The year before I won the tournament in '08, I came in last. So it's been up and down, up and down. Right now, I'm supposed to be on the up, going up. So hopefully there will be something good on Sunday. 

 Q. Obviously on a day like this with the wind, yardage books pretty much throw them out the door. Did you have a tough time gauging what to hit, if you had 160 yards, how much of a factor was the wind? 
 Y.E. YANG: Yeah, it was a big factor, really. Especially the last three holes. The toughest holes on the course may be on Tour, as well. I had a lot of wind coming in so really tried to play conservative and just make par. I had to putt that into consideration, not just play-by-play but strategy as well, playing the overall course, probably have to be the same tomorrow. And the wind changes a lot, as well. So it's really hard to calculate everything. That's a big factor indeed.
