Y.E. YANG: Today, a couple holes, morning, early start, so a little maybe not too windy, it's okay.  But after over maybe four or five holes, then after windy, a little more stronger.   
This wind, under par is okay, yeah, happy.   
 Q.  How do you adapt when you're used to one condition for so many hours, and then it gets harder?  
Y.E. YANG: I don't understand.   
 Q.  How do you change when it's one condition for those first two hours and then it's so much harder and the wind picks up?  
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, wind is stronger and maybe helping, it's okay.  But in the front, so difficult, and maybe 17, 18 should bogey, but yeah, played in so tough conditions.   
 Q.  Tell me about the 14th hole.  
Y.E. YANG: 14, yeah, I shot 165 yards, but two, three clubs more windy and I tried rescue, but left open the face and went right in the deep rough.  Then laid up, 50 yards, sand wedge, and I tried just on the green but lucky to hit the pin, yeah.  Lucky par.   
 Q.  Did you think that it was going in the hole?  
Y.E. YANG: I have to check the pitchmark, maybe only three inches from the pin maybe, but par is good.
