Q. Tell me about the finish today, because that's a lovely finish here?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, after I finished 17, 18, good finish.  No. 11, bogey, a couple bogeys.  But good today.
Q. Happy with your position into Sunday?
Y.E. YANG: No, so-so.  It's six strokes behind.  Maybe I want to try today more aggressive play.  But a couple make bogey and I dropped the score.  But yeah, after tomorrow and strong play.
Q. Are you enjoying playing back in Hong Kong?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, I always come to Hong Kong, enjoy playing.  Lovely course and lovely city.
Q. And still lots to play for before the end of the year?
Y.E. YANG: I think so.
