 Q.   How does this course suit your game?   You hit it well today.

 Q.   Looking to the weekend, you know you have to shoot a low number to be up there on Saturday and Sunday?  
Y.E. YANG:   Yeah, I tried to low score because here is wide fairways and some green is difficult.   Many players now low score.   I do maybe.   We try.
