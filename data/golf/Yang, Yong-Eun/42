  Q. So your play today, 2-under, how do you feel?  
 Y.E. YANG: The front nine, it got to 2-over for the day really fast. On the 5th hole I missed a makeable putt, and then on the next hole I hit it a bit short and made bogey on both, and it was sort of an uphill battle from there on.   
  
  Q. You had a good first round and then kind of stayed around par the rest of the week. What was the difference between the first round and the rest of the tournament?   
 Y.E. YANG: I'm a bit of a streaky player, so I like having my birdies early, and if I don't, then it sort of frustrates me and it just impacts my whole game. The short putts that I missed sort of affected my whole game throughout.
