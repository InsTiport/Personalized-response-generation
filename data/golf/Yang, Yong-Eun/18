Q.   Just your assessment of the round today, 2â€‘under? 
Y.E. YANG:   It's a bit chilly today.   I started off well.   I started off with a birdie and the front nine I played quite well.   I think the bogey on the back nine was a little bit of a disappointment.   But overall, I'm encouraged.   I still have three more rounds, a lot of golf left, and I'm only four strokes behind the leader now, so I still have high hopes.

Q.   How were conditions? 
Y.E. YANG:   First time I've experienced this kind of weather in Hong Kong. 

Q.   The golf course, with the wind blowing as hard as it was, were the greens faster and firmer? 
Y.E. YANG:   It was a little bit faster and maybe because of the wind, the greens were a bit affected.   But overall course conditions were quite good.   It was favourable to play, really.   It was okay. 

Q.   Is there anything that you need to work on before tomorrow's round? 
Y.E. YANG:   I guess I have to catch up, so it means a lot of birdies tomorrow.   That means I have to putt well, practice putting.   So I need to read the lines properly. 
But also, I think the weather is going to affect a lot of players tomorrow because it's an anticipated to be a little bit colder than today.   So keeping myself warm is another big key for tomorrow. 

Q.   Do you prefer playing when the weather is like this, or would you prefer it hot and sunny? 
Y.E. YANG:   I think I prefer the warmer, sunnier weather.   I tend to play better in that type of weather.
