 Q.   Sum up your round.   
Y.E. YANG:   It's been an up‑and‑down day today.   A lot of bogeys, a lot of birdies, even an eagle.   So, yeah, it's been quite a roller coaster day today.   
   
 Q.   Are you able to put your finger on why the inconsistency today?   
Y.E. YANG:   I think it's because I had a morning tee off time, I didn't sleep well, very cold, and not fully warmed up.   I think that's why.   
   
 Q.   3‑under par right now for the tournament, leader is probably on 8‑under now.   Do you feel that you're still right in it for the weekend?   
Y.E. YANG:   Maybe if we play good, I think so.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you're swinging the club good enough this week?   
Y.E. YANG:   I think if my putter works a bit more, I think it will work out quite well.   
   
 Q.   I presume you're going to hit the range later on; is there anything in your game you'll try to work onto get yourself better prepared for the weekend?   
Y.E. YANG:   Just putting.
