 Q. What does it mean to you to win your first Presidents Cup match? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I just enjoy the week and playing with Y.E., he's a great guy. 

 Q. What was it like to have Ryo as a teammate? 
 Y.E. YANG: He's young, but he definitely doesn't play young. I told him on the first tee that we should have fun and we did have fun, and we had a win, as well. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I was really nervous today, but had nervous feelings that you get when you're about to win, so it was a great feeling. 
 Y.E. YANG: It's a very good day. I played quite well and had fun with Ryo. He's been a great teammate. I'm very happy that I could contribute to the team and I'm just going to go out and cheer for my team.
