Q. 7-under par around the West Course, that's some going, isn't it?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, happy today.  Difficult holes but starting, first hole bogey make but after come and play very well after and finish, good score.  Happy today.
Q. So what did you do well?
Y.E. YANG: I think everything, driver and second shot and maybe putter.  Good putter, yeah.
Q. And have you grown to like Wentworth down the years?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, sometimes.  Sometimes the course rain, windy, it's difficult, so difficult, but today is perfect weather.
Q. What do you think of your standing in Korean golf at the moment, when you look to a big poster at the young man who won it last year, and with Wang and Li winning on The European Tour this season.
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, now, men or more playing good after maybe more better than me and K.J. and different players, and more and more good players coming.
Q. But does that mean that you dig deep and think, I've got to get back on my best because there's all these young players doing well?
Y.E. YANG: Maybe.
