Q.  You must be pleased with such a good round?
YANG YONG-EUN:  With the winds being so strong, I was thinking one or two under would be a good score. I got more than that, so I'm happy.
Q.  What was the key for you?
YANG YONG-EUN:  Overall, the scores weren't that good. I said I would just take it comfortably and that strategy work. I didn't set high expectations.
Q.  As you play so much in Japan, this kind of condition must be familiar to you?
YANG YONG-EUN:  In Japan you get a lot of wind. I'm also from Jeju Island (in Korea) which is my home town and it's very windy back home. I'm very comfortable in these sort of conditions.
Q.  Thoughts about tomorrow?
YANG YONG-EUN:  There are a lot of good players. I'm not going to think about them but just concentrate on my own game.
Q.  Would you prefer to play in similar conditions as today?
YANG YONG-EUN:  I think my chances will be better with the wind. Without the wind, a lot of players can shoot five under or better.
Q.  Tell us about your back nine, 32?
YANG YONG-EUN: On the 10th, I hit an eight iron from 147 yards against the wind to 25 feet and holed the putt for birdie. On 13, I hit a wedge to 10 feet for birdie. On the par five 14, I was on the greenside in two and chipped close. On the last hole, I hit a wedge to 3 feet for birdie.
Q.
Do you look at the leaderboard?
YANG YONG-EUN:  I like looking at the leaderboard. It's fun. At this point, I'm not at the level of Tiger or Retief. I've got to take it one step at a time. That's what I've been doing and that's been helping me this week.
