Q.   What did you do that was good today? 
Y.E. YANG:   A little windy but I make my shot, it's not much high and a little low backswing is, I make it.   And then I tried to be very calm, good playing.

Q.   Do you like Wentworth?   Do you like playing here? 
Y.E. YANG:   Before a couple times, but been very good day today.   So weather, before windy and greens so difficult.   But today is very happy.
