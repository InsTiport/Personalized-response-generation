  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 Y.E. YANG: Yesterday and Ryo and I jokingly said we should birdie every hole and alternate between each other and it ended up being a bit like that. Ryo made some very nice putts. Myself I made some putts, but we were really efficient, actually. Played really efficiently, and we had a good time. I think Ryo and I have some good chemistry, but it's up to the captain and whatever the captain deems is good for the greater cause, I'm all up for it.   
  
  Q. Do you feel invigorated playing with someone so young?   
 Y.E. YANG: I wouldn't say invigorated but I don't know if the timing was great or the chemistry was great, but every time I hit a nice shot, he hit a great shot.   
 When he hit a bad shot, I hit a good shot, and putting was the same as well, so it really worked out very well.
