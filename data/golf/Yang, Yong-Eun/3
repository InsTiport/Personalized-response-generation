Q. Good state of mind, good attitude, to bounce back from 17 with the birdie?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, I think 17 a little maybe angry birdie, near the hole but missing to chipping.  But after 18 hole, finishing good bunker shot and make birdie, yeah, happy.
Q. Are you very positive and very confident about your game at the moment?
Y.E. YANG: More my swing is more thinking, but sometimes I'm fast on bad swing.  But I think the thinking is positive.
Q. Is this because you've put in a lot of work, a lot of hard work and lots of good, positive practice?
Y.E. YANG: I think so.  This week is green and chipping, everything, difficult, but a lot of practice and more thinking good.
