  Q. Did you know where you stood when you finished?   
 YE YANG: I didn't know the exact ranking where I was FedExCup points wise, but the weather is not ideal today, so a lot of players must have struggled, and I knew that if I played under par today, I would have a good chance to still cling on to that last few spots.   
 I did have a chance to check midway, and I was still around the bubble, so I figured I'd probably be still around the same position I started at.  
  
  Q. Your caddie was saying you hit 2-hybrid on the last hole, and you cleared the water it looked like by just a little. Kind of an anxious moment?   
 YE YANG: I did try that. I did focus quite a lot and try to hit the right shot, but I think I hit it a little bit fat but actually made it fly a little bit low. I thought as it was in flight that it might not even clear the hazard. Right when I saw it hit the front edge of the green and go over instead of coming back into the water, I think that was when I had -- my legs got a little bit weaker there.
