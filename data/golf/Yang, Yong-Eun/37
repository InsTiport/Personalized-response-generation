   Y. E. YANG: I felt good for the last three days when I was winning. I feel a bit tired. I had to wake up really early. I slept quite late, actually. There was a party going on right in the back of my hotel, so I didn't get to sleep until about 12.   
 But not to make any excuses, Kuchar played really well. I just think my game ended up being a bit shaky. I guess below average kicking in over there.  
 But overall I feel good. Putting ended on a good note. So hopefully I'll do better at Honda.
