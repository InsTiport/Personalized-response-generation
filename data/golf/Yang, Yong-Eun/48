   Y.E. YANG: Yeah, 16 I really needed to make a birdie, and on the 17th I made a bogey. I think if I do lose, or if I don't win, then that would be the reason why I didn't win, on 17.

 Q. When you hit the tee shot on 17, did you think maybe it had a chance of staying up? 
 Y.E. YANG: You know, I don't know if it would have stayed, but I really rushed it. I should have waited until the guys on the green holed out. But somehow I got really anxious, and I just hit it too fast. 

 Q. Was there any adjustments either with your golf swing or mentally when you made the turn after nine holes? 
 Y.E. YANG: Maybe a little bit. I didn't really do any adjustment, but after I eagled 11, I felt really aggressive, and I think that's probably the mentality that changed. 

 Q. You then made birdies and got sole possession of the lead after your birdie at 15. How much adrenaline did you have throughout the 16th hole? 
 Y.E. YANG: On the 16th I didn't really get pumped up because I thought that I just needed to get it close to the pin, and par was good, I think.
