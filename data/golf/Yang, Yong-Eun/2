Q. That seemed hard work out there.
Y.E. YANG: Today is so hard, difficult, windy, and everything difficult today.
Q. Tell me some of the things that made it difficult in the wind.  How was it to keep your control?
Y.E. YANG: I think first mind control, and then after,  green stays, not very well to putt, a little more practice putting.
Q. So what with your mind were you having to second guess shots, think again so many times?  Were you having to think shots a lot and not quite fluent or in good rhythm?
Y.E. YANG: Yeah, I try tomorrow, I think more quiet swing, everything is mind, yeah, I think so, everything.
Q. Despite having a hard day, you're in a good position, so what do you think about Sunday?
Y.E. YANG: Today's score is not so good, but position still is okay.  Tomorrow I try good play, yeah.
Q. Because you've been in that position so many times, but not for a little while, does that adjust your approach?  Are you any different tomorrow?
Y.E. YANG: Maybe more concentration, I think tomorrow is important, yeah.
