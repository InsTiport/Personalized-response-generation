 Q. What was different today? 
 Y.E. YANG: Seems like I'm getting better into the weekend. I didn't sleep well so I didn't actually anticipate another good round, but somehow I actually found my pace and found my swing and felt that my rhythm was quite good on the back nine but unfortunately I missed a lot of putts, crucial birdie putts, especially from the 14th onward. I'm a bit disappointed about that. 

 Q. Did the fans cheering for you and recognizing you and pronouncing your name properly, instead of calling you "Wie" or "Choi" help you?
 Y.E. YANG: That helps a bit as well. I'm focused but when I sometimes hear my name being called out, it does give sort of a moral boost. It's a feel-good situation, especially when I finish up and everybody is calling me. 
 Some people actually are calling me "Yeah Yang." I don't know if they are doing it on purpose or their own convenience but I don't mind. 
 Probably I'll try and get better sleep tomorrow. 

 Q. What about the possibility of being paired with Tiger again? 
 Y.E. YANG: I'm just going to try and play like any other game. I'd rather avoid him than play with him the next round. 

 Q. Your thoughts on the FedExCup and getting into THE TOUR Championship?
 Y.E. YANG: It's a different format and totally different type of game. It's not just one tournament; it's a slew of tournaments that I have to try and concentrate on. I just have to try concentrating on each tournament and that's my main goal right now.
