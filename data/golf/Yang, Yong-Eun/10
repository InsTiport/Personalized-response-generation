 Q.   Tell me how well you played today.   
Y.E. YANG:   When I started it was very windy.   The wind started picking up quite a bit so tried to stay conservative.   I wasn't overly aggressive as I usually a.m..   I think that that helped me out a bit.   
I missed a few putts that I could have made but overall, putting is improving compared to last week, as well.   So I think if I can play within my realm, I'll be okay.  
   
 Q.   Given those conditions and despite what happened at the last, are you satisfied with your position on this leaderboard?   
Y.E. YANG:   Really, apart from 18, the overall game that I could assess for my game today is that I'm quite satisfied with where I'm heading to.   I think it will be a good mark to finish my season.   It's been a while since I've been on the leaderboard after the first round so that's definitely a plus.   Hopefully I can build upon that.   
   
 Q.   And yet, your form has been pretty good, hasn't it?   
Y.E. YANG:   I think my swing, irons, drivers, long irons are all good.   Finally figured out how to swing it properly.   Now the putter is giving me a few fits but that will also probably come naturally.   
Coming over to Asia probably lifted my spirits a little bit.   I'm definitely coming back into form and this would be a good time to play well and prepare for next year.   
   
 Q.   On that note, tell me about playing here, because you've had some good form at Fanling before.   
Y.E. YANG:   I've always liked this course.   And it's a big tournament in Asia, really.   It's one of the big ones over here.   If you consider Hong Kong a nation, then it is a national title and usually try my best in national titles.   
Hopefully this could jump start my second career.
