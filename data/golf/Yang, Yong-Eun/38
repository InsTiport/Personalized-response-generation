 Q. Y.E., you've beaten one of the best players in the world, a very hot player in match play format, how does that feel?
 Y.E. YANG: It feels good. Right now it feels great to win over Graeme. I think my overall condition is good. And just because I won it, my condition feels better.

 Q. What's pleased you most about your play so far?
 Y.E. YANG: I just try to play within my own -- just play my game. 

 Q. Matt Kuchar tomorrow. Know much of him? Have you played with him?
 Y.E. YANG: I played a couple of rounds with him before, just stroke play. It was a different format, as you all know, from match play. 
 Once again I'm going to try to focus on my own game, and not really think about what he's doing.
