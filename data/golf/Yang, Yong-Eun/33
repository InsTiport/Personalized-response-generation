 Q. You didn't want to drop those last two shots on the last two holes. But a fantastic opening round. Assess the round for us. 
 Y.E. YANG: Well, I feel good, I feel good. On the second hole I missed a birdieable chance, really. I was a bit down, but on the fourth hole, a par-5, I made a good putt to start off a string of birdies on 8 and 9 as well. I was on a really downhill from there in a good way. I was catching speed, I had some tail wind on me, and even though I missed the putts and I had to settle for bogey on 11, I think that the 13th, I think it is my first eagle in Augusta National. 
 It really helped me out to gain that wind again and I rode it into 16. And I saw myself in the leaderboard tied with the leader, I guess I got a little bit over zealous in the last two holes. 
 So it's, yeah, as you said, it's a bit disappointing to finish off two bogeys in a row, and go back down to behind the leader, but at the same time still a lot of golf left, and it's been an overall good experience so far and I hope that it doesn't end prematurely. I hope it goes along for three more days. 

 Q. Last year you had some great rounds here, had a top-10 finish. Another great round today. How much confidence does that give you going into the rest of the week?
 Y.E. YANG: It's a very good course for Koreans, for us. It's atypical of a Korean course, so if you're on a good day, I think that it's to our advantage, really, this course is. 
 So, and it definitely builds on the confidence and the momentum. Although it's a year apart, still, coming over here and putting on a good performance in one of the best arenas possible I think it only builds upon your confidence. 
 Hopefully, it doesn't dwindle and I can ride upon it for three more days.
