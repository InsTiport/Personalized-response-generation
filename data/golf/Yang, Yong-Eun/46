 Q. Can you talk about your performance today? 
 Y.E. YANG: I was just trying to make even today. It was very windy, so my strategy was to just put it on safely and then two-putt it, and somehow some of the putts rolled in.

 Q. What about the possibility of winning back-to-back majors? 
 Y.E. YANG: I've really never thought about it that way. Every tournament that I come into, I usually try to put myself in a position to at least go into the Top 10 after the third round. It would be nice, yes, but no, I really don't have a conscious, I guess, feeling of trying to win back-to-back majors, no. 

 Q. Were you surprised by your performance? 
 Y.E. YANG: I don't want to say that I'm surprised, but that's the best round that I've had here at Augusta National, so I am very happy.
