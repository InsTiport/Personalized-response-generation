 Q.  This golf course, if you've played it before, you knew you were going to get something a little different but this is a lot different?  
D.A. POINTS: It is.  It's a lot bigger and a little more severe with the Bermuda grass and you get downgrain spots that go from being 13 on the Stimp to 20 on the Stimp.  It's pretty severe.  I managed it well today.  Maybe didn't have my greatest stuff off the tee, but my iron play was solid and my short game, my touch was good.   
 Q.  Is this a quadrant golf course still now?  I was with Phil Mickelson today a lot, and he put it on the wrong sides of the hole and you are just dead?  
D.A. POINTS: Then it becomes so defensive.  I feel like I hit a lot of my numbers today.  On certain holes I did a good job of keeping it in front of me.  Every once a while it's a hard golf course, sometimes you have got to sack up and hit a good one.
