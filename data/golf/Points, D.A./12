Q.   Well, you gave it your best.   You tried to match them birdie for birdie.   You have to be pleased with how you showed up on Sunday?
D.A. POINTS:   No question.   7‑under, no bogeys.   I'll take that every day for the rest of my life, and I'll come out on top more often than not.   I mean, Billy played great, I mean amazing.   To hole that putt after the delay and knowing that I had a really good look at birdie, that if he wanted to end it now, it had to go in.   The thing was pure.   It was awesome.   My hat's off to him.   He's played great golf all year, so he deserves it.

Q.   You're continuing to play well.   How do you feel moving forward? 
D.A. POINTS:   Great.   Last year I lost in the playoff at Wells Fargo, so I'm looking forward to going back there and PLAYERS and Nelson, so I'm excited.

Q.   You gave them everything you could handle. 
D.A. POINTS:   Yeah, I mean, 7‑under, 7 birdies, no bogeys, I played rock solid and had a real good run there.   To come out and know I needed at least a 4 on the last hole and to still do that, I was proud of myself. 
But Billy played great.   Whatever, nine birdies and a bogey, that's awesome golf.

Q.   We'll be looking at the World Golf rankings, but you've got to be close to the top 50.   A win, a second place finish, and that road to Atlanta is pretty much paved for you. 
D.A. POINTS:   I've still got work to do.   That's been one of my goals since the beginning of the year is to get to that top 30.   Hopefully this is one step closer.
