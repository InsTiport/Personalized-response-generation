 Q.   First day, didn't play quite as well as 8-under par but you've played a lot better than your scores have indicated the last two.  
D.A. POINTS:   For sure.   I've started to strike it really well, feel good about it.   The putter feels good.   Really made only two bad strokes today and all the rest were good.   They just aren't finding the hole.  
   
 Q.   When you're out playing well from the beginning of the year, you start striking it solid, at least that part of anxiety is out of the picture.  
D.A. POINTS:   Yeah.   The putter feels good.   I'm hitting a lot of solid putts, it's just when I hit it on line, it wasn't the right line, and when I finally had it read right it -- I didn't hit it that great.   You know, tomorrow is a new day.  
   
 Q.   Let our listeners know how crazy this golf course would be if you try to shoot par without smoke and mirrors.  
D.A. POINTS:   Too much water and too many bunkers.   It's a tough place.
