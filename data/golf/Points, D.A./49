  Q. A 6-under 64, seven birdies and a bogey and obviously a hot finish. Talk about your round.   
 D.A. POINTS: You know, it was real boring. I hit it in the fairway, hit a lot of greens, and I did have a nice chip in on No. 6, but really stuffed a couple wedge shots on the last nine. And then I just kind of played real solid, just kept it right in front of me.  
  
  Q. How did you find the conditions here in the morning on the first day of the tournament?  
 D.A. POINTS: Well, the start out this morning was so hot and humid that the ball was going nowhere. That made it a little challenging into some of the back nine par-4s where they're straight uphill and a little into the wind and really heavy.   
 But the greens are real soft, and getting out in the morning is a big advantage because they're probably going to get a little bumpy, and they might get a little crusty. I had to try to take advantage of it, and fortunately I did.
