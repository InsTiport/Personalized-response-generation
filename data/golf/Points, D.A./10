Q.   What did you think of D.A.'s decision to play today?   One comment about how much that meant to you?
CONDOLEEZZA RICE:   Well, it meant an enormous amount to me.   He didn't have to do that. 
And I, more than anybody, know what it's like to be on the road a lot and perhaps get to go home early, but he's a wonderful, wonderful person and it was‑‑ it speaks really well for him and for the TOUR that he came out and played anyway. 

Q.   I know it was tough circumstances yesterday, just talk a little bit about your decision to come back today and play with Secretary Rice. 
D.A. POINTS:   Well, it's not every day that you get to play 18 holes at Spyglass, let alone 18 holes at Spyglass with Secretary Rice.   And she's such a sweet, just warm hearted woman and she loves golf and she's wanting to get better and it just‑‑ I signed up to play at Pebble Beach AT&T Pro‑am, it's not just about me and the golf tournament, it's about playing with our amateurs and making sure they have a good time. 
And who knows, if we could have come out today and lit the scoreboard up, lit the place on fire, maybe she would have got to see tomorrow.   And my intent was to come out and help her have a good time and give her an opportunity to keep playing.
