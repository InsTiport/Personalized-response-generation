 Q.   D.A., just comment on the round if you can.   
D.A. POINTS:   Well, the defending champions did not play very well.   Neither one of us did.   I didn't play awful, but the conditions were so perfect, and I just didn't take advantage of the great day.   
Even par at Spy Glass isn't always that terrible, but today the conditions were pretty pure.   And Bill struggled.   I think his knee's hurting a little bit, and he's developed a couple bad habits because of that.   But we've got three more days to have a lot of fun.
