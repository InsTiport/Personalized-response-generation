 Q. Under par on a tough track today, overall thoughts on the round?
 D.A. POINTS: Yeah, it was good. Solid. I drove it as good as I possibly could. I think I missed one fairway and I hit it into the first cut. 
 So if I can do that for the rest of the week, it will be a lot -- it will make the place a lot easier. But really, struck it well. Struggled getting the speed of the greens early but settled down later and shot a couple under on the last nine.

 Q. Pretty much playing in the teeth of the humidity tomorrow and playing in the morning tomorrow, do you think that will be a big advantage for you?
 D.A. POINTS: Yeah, because the greens are good but they scuff up. There's a lot of stuff you were standing there looking down at land mines it looked like. 
 So tomorrow it will be nice to have some smoother greens and maybe a little bit cooler. We had some gusty wind, too, so I'm very pleased with the score and hopefully the conditions will be good tomorrow and I can go low.

 Q. Do you feel like you left anything out there?
 D.A. POINTS: Oh, sure. I didn't get it up-and-down from the green-side bunker on the par 5 on the front, and I a 10-footer on 6 that I missed. There's a couple. And I got a couple nice bounces off tee shots and hit some good shots, so there's no complaints.
