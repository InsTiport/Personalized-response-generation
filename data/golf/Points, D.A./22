 Q.   D.A., 3‑under 68, round 1.   Are you happy with that round?   
D.A. POINTS:   Yeah, I'm happy because I haven't played worth a darn in a while.   But I left some out there.   My opening nine, which I started on the back nine, I hit it really good and had some really good opportunities and shot 3‑under, but it was really a 5‑ or 6‑under nine with making some putts.   
And then the second nine I struggled a little bit but hung in there.   You know, it's a fine start.   
   
 Q.   You're outside the top 70 coming in here, so what do you need to do?   Do you know?  
D.A. POINTS:   Finish inside the top 70 (chuckling).   I have no idea.   I know if I play well, it'll take care of itself.   My first and foremost goal is to just get it under par each day and hopefully make the cut and then go from there.   But if I keep playing like I did today, I will be fine.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you'll get the same kind of conditions tomorrow as you did being first off this morning?  
D.A. POINTS:   Well, of course not, but tomorrow is supposed to be a little less windy and a little cooler, which will maybe be nice for us in the afternoon.   The front nine is set up with some pretty dicey pins, so I don't envy the guys this afternoon.
