  Q. 4-under on the last four holes. What a way to finish.   
 D.A. POINTS: I'm so grateful. I'm so fortunate that I hit good shots and I finally got some putts to fall on the last few holes. I can't tell you how excited I am.  
  
  Q. You keep racking up these Top 10s this year. Do you feel your game is ready for the next level?   
 D.A. POINTS: Absolutely. For me it's all about putting. Today I didn't hit it that great. I still kept it in front of me and hit a couple key shots coming down the stretch, and then obviously making the putts is where it's all at.  
  
  Q. Where do you go from here?  
 D.A. POINTS: I've got British Open qualifying 8:10 tomorrow morning, so hopefully I can keep it rolling for 36 holes and then The Colonial next week.   
  
  Q. Tough start on the round. It was tough for both of you guys to get anything going.   
 D.A. POINTS: I haven't played the front nine worth a darn all week. I hit it bad today and kind of scraped it around and then made a nice birdie on 10, and I just stayed patient and kept kind of hanging in there, and then I got a good one to go on 15 and then the eagle on 16, and then 18 was awesome.  
  
  Q. You're leaving on an up then despite not getting a win?  
 D.A. POINTS: Yeah, you know what, 5-under today, and especially 5-under on my last nine holes, finishing solo third, it's my highest finish ever, highest paycheck ever. It's the highest I've ever been a part of.  
  
  Q. What's next for you then?  
 D.A. POINTS: British Open qualifying at 8:10 tomorrow morning.  
  
  Q. It never stops, does it?  
 D.A. POINTS: No, that's the way it goes. But I'm grateful and I'm looking forward to trying to qualify for that and then playing Colonial next week.
