  Q. Overall your thoughts on today's round?  
 D.A. POINTS: It was not my day. I grinded my tail off. I hit -- I hit better shots than I was rewarded with, and you know, I did make some putts and I missed a bunch of short ones. So it was a crazy round but I was proud of myself for hanging in the way I did.  
  
  Q. How important is it that you are going to go into tomorrow, looks like only about four off the lead going into tomorrow's round?  
 D.A. POINTS: I would like it to be two or one or none. But four shots isn't very many out here. This is a hard golf course, and you know, if you can play the hard holes pars and maybe make a couple of the birdies if the PGA sets it up that way, you've got a shot.  
  
  Q. Are you expecting things to be different, I know they moved some tees up, were you expecting them to go back tomorrow?  
 D.A. POINTS: I would imagine so. You know, I think they wanted to do it today for some excitement, and they did, and I thought the setup so far every day has been pretty good with the tees moved around and the pins and everything.   
 You know, imagine tomorrow they will move some back, and it will probably be all you want.   
  
  Q. Do you have a number in mind that you are going to have to have for tomorrow or go out there and do your best?  
 D.A. POINTS: You know, I'll be happy to shoot under par, and I think if I get it going, I can get it four or five and have a shot.
