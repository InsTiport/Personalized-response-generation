  Q. Talk about the experience of playing in the par-3 with your mom on the bag.   
 D.A. POINTS: It was awesome. She did a good job. Up until the last hole I hadn't made a bogey, I made a couple birdies.   
 The weather is perfect, the fans are great, we're super lucky. It was just -- you couldn't have asked for a more perfect day.  
  
  Q. How did you end up in the Spaniard group?  
 D.A. POINTS: You know what I really looked for a 4:20 time and really late and because I just, I guess that it was first come, first serve and by the time I signed up that's when they had available.   
 So they told me that if I came early and hung out that they would try to fill me in whenever they could and that just happened to be the spot I got.   
  
  Q. Does this help you get ready for the tournament at all?  
 D.A. POINTS: Absolutely. I hit it well. Any time -- these greens are small and tough. If you can control it on these greens, it will be very similar to like out there.   
  
  Q. What can you do now to top this as far as a gift for your mother? Mother's Day is in a month?  
 D.A. POINTS: I don't know. I don't know. There's a lot to do, but hopefully maybe a special coat fitting on Sunday would maybe go a long way. That would maybe do it. That would do it. She didn't want it to end.   
 MRS. POINTS: Yeah, he wouldn't play another nine. I begged him to play another nine.   
 D.A. POINTS: Yeah, she didn't want it to end, for sure.
