  Q. Key to the round today?  
 D.A. POINTS: Hitting in the fairway. If you can hit it in the fairway -- the bunkering is really tough. The sand is really tough, and the greens, a lot of them being elevated, you try to hit out of the rough, it makes it really difficult.   
 If I can keep it in the fairway --  
  
  Q. Going into the week, everyone was saying how this is such a long hitter's golf course, and obviously that has not been the case, can you talk specifically about your strategy --  
 D.A. POINTS: Are you saying because I'm short that that's not the case? Gee, thanks.   
 Again, if you hit it far and hit it in the fairways, it's going to make it a whole lot easier. But if you don't hit it in the fairways, I don't care how far you hit it, it's going to be really, really hard.   
 I don't liken it to a bomber's course, because a bomber's course, doesn't matter if you hit it in the fairway or not. For me, I thought that I would just hit driver on every hole and I haven't, I've hit 3-woods and hybrids here and there.   
  
  Q. What was the difference for you today?   
 D.A. POINTS: I rolled a couple of putts. A couple good bounces here and there are, the ball may be headed for the first cut of rough and stays the fairway, that kind of thing.
