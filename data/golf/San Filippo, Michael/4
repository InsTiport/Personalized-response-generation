 Q. Overall your comments on your two rounds here. 
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, overall yesterday was not very good and today was much better. So I think that it's, with the wind playing really tricky, I'm getting a little better feel for the golf course. And how, what I'm really having a problem with is distance control. The atmosphere, living in and playing in South Florida, coming up here and playing in this atmosphere, I don't know what club to hit. I keep hitting the wrong club. 
 So I'm constantly struggling with computations to try to figure out how far to hit the ball. But I was very pleased with my play today. I hit it really good today. Didn't get much out of the round, but I think I'm going to make the cut and I'm looking forward to Saturday and Sunday. 

 Q. What was the highlight of your first two rounds?
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: There hasn't been many highlights. Yesterday was a very aggravating day in the sense that I wasted a lot of shots. Today I didn't waste a lot of shots, I just didn't take advantage. 
 But I hit some really, I got on a streak out there and started hitting some real good shots early on the front nine today and hopefully I'm going in the right direction.
