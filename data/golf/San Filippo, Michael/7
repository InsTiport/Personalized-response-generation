 Q.  Just a couple of putts and you would have shot even par. 
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  No, 1-over.  I'm a little disappointed.  After the start I got, I kind of messed it up at the end, which is, you know, it's a tough back nine.  And I made a couple bad decisions and you don't think straight you're going to pay out here.  So I guess that's what happened. 

 Q.  Just some thoughts on the weekend as a whole? 
 RON STELTEN:  Well I enjoyed it.  It was great.  The weather turned out great on the weekend. 
 The course was playable, you know, I mean the wind's died down and made it fair, I thought. 
 And I really like the golf course.  I know some guys may not, but I think it's a great golf course.  And it was a great week for me.  I was, you know, I'm pleased.
