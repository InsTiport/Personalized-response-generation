  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  I probably played the best I played all week.  I haven't seen anybody make any putts.  I don't know what it is about them.  But I'm sure somebody is.  But I felt like I hit the ball better today than ever and hopefully if I can get a few putts to drop tomorrow I'll have a good round.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  It sure was nice to be out there.  I enjoyed playing with Hale and Scott, two great players.  And it was a gorgeous day to play.  I'm sure somebody's going to shoot some good scores.  I saw Stadler was playing pretty well.  It was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed my day.   
  
  Q.  Any holes stand out for you?   
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  Well, I made a beautiful, I hit a great birdie at 14 and hit a lot of good shots on the back nine.  Really, every shot I hit just right on the back nine.   
 So I got to feel like my swing is probably the best today it's been.  Of course, the wind was down so you could swing at the ball a little.  You weren't trying to finagle with it all day long and over it.   
 Just a matter of putting.  If I could have made a few more putts I probably would have had a really good round.
