  Q. If you could just give me some comments on your day.   
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, for me it was a long day. Because I only played six holes yesterday. So 30 holes, it's been a long walk, up-and-down and a little wet, so I'm tired. But I'm happy I enjoyed the day. It was, I had great guys to play with, really enjoyed the company and the golf course actually was pretty good of the it was dryer than I expected. So hopefully we'll be around for the weekend.  
  
  Q. So compared to yesterday was it the same?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: I thought it was a little dryer today. Yeah. I think it's improving. Hopefully the weekend will bring better weather and walking will be a little easier.
