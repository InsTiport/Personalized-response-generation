  Q. How was the tournament this week?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: The tournament was tough and enjoyable, all in one. It was a great experience. I love playing in it, I wish I would have played a little better, but I like the golf course. The winds made it tough.   
 Other than that, it was certainly a week I'll remember.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to you to play in such an outstanding tournament this week?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well it was important. First of all, I had never played golf in Colorado, so I wanted to come to Colorado and see this beautiful state and city and I have enjoyed my stay here. So that was probably the primary thing for me, just coming to a new place and seeing a new place.   
 I had heard a lot about this golf course and it certainly lived up to its expectations. A little too tough for me, but it was fun being here anyway. Glad I made the cut. That was great.
