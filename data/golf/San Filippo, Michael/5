 Q. How did the game go today? 3-over but you had some birdies. 
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Actually, I was four, unfortunately, but it went okay. I hit the ball really well, I did not negotiate the greens very well today. Could have been a really good round. Had it to 1-over and finished with three bogeys, which kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. 
 But all in all I'm pleased, I'm encouraged, I'm hitting it good, now I just got to figure a way to get it in the hole.

 Q. You got a busy seven or eight years senior, senior circuit. 
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Yeah, I've had sort of a second career sort of transitioned into playing the TOUR and it's been a lot of fun. It's been a nice change of life-style for me, I do miss being a club pro, I imagine I'll probably go back some day to being a club pro. Especially if I keep putting the way I'm putting. 
 But in the meantime, I'm having a great time, playing with these guys, and you know, as long as my wife's okay with it, I'm going to hang in there.

 Q. Have you gotten any of those holes-in-one on while you were on the Senior Tour?
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, yeah, well, actually, I did make a couple out there. I made one in New York and I made one in Kansas City. But I wasn't in the hole-in-one pool. So that's the story.

 Q. Does this course look like it's a potential for another hole-in-one for you?
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, gosh, I don't know, I'm just happy to make 3s on the par-3s. The par-3's are really good. I came close on 17 today, I hit a really good shot in there with a 3-iron. You know, hole-in-ones are, they happen, they're lucky.

 Q. You've had a number of them. 
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Yeah, yeah, actually I have been lucky.
