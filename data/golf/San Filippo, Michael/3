  Q. Comments on your round today?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, unfortunately it was actually about a lot better round than the score indicated. I had two real big holes where I made a triple and a double. I actually played the par-5s 5-over and that's just no good.   
 Other than that, I felt like I played pretty well. Greens were a lot quicker today, that's for sure. Scores will be probably a little higher. Although the wind's down. It was a beautiful day.   
 Unfortunately, I just didn't take care of business.   
  
  Q. So similar plan of attack for tomorrow?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Yeah, just got to get away from those big numbers, they're killing me, I'm making too many big numbers in this tournament. And I don't know whether it's just bad decision making or what, but that's the way, that's golf. What are you going to do?
