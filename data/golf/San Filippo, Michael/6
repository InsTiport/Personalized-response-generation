  Q. How is the course playing today?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, according to my score, I guess it was playing pretty tough. It wasn't really that bad. It seemed like it played a little faster. Driving the ball a little further than I was in the practice round. It's drying out, the wind is drying it out.   
 Just didn't play very good. I drove it great and didn't hit very good iron shots. My short game there. But hopefully tomorrow will be better. Bring it back.  
  
  Q. How do you think the weather affected play today?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, the wind was pretty tough. It's swirling and blowing pretty hard. But no excuses. I think it still was better than playing in the rain in the morning.   
  
  Q. What are you going to do differently tomorrow?  
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: I'm not going to do anything differently. I'm going to get up, try to drive it in the fairway on 1 and birdie 1 and go from there. That's about all I can do.
