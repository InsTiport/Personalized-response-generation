Q. Sierra, how was today?
SIERRA BROOKS: Today's round meant a lot just for me to obviously play well not only for myself but just meaning I can have a chance on Saturday to compete at Augusta National.  So yeah, the fact that I'm going to be able to do that just means so much.
Q. Practice round Friday at Augusta National.  What do you hope to accomplish during that practice round?
SIERRA BROOKS: Well, I know it's going to be raining, but I'm going to try to get in as much notes as I can on that place.  I'm having a local caddie come out and help me around there, so hopefully he can give me all the tips that I need.
Q. You've played Augusta National before.  How do you feel your game suits that golf course?
SIERRA BROOKS: Yeah, I feel like it suits it well.  I'm confident off the tee right now and I feel good with my putting.  Out there it's obviously placement, and definitely into the greens, but you want to have good lines because those greens out there are tricky.
Q. Just a couple shots back at this point of the lead.  What are you anticipating for that final round?
SIERRA BROOKS: I'm sure it's going to be an exciting final round.  I know Jennifer is in the lead right now and she's an unbelievable player.  It will be a fun final day.
