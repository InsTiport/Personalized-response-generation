MODERATOR:  Thanks for joining us, Linda.  Could you just go over your scorecard?
LINDA ISHII:  Sure.  Let's see.
MODERATOR:  Birdie on 4?
LINDA ISHII:  Yes.  Birdie of 4.  Hold on, let me think.  4.  Oh, I hit my drive, left side.  I had about 140 into the hole, it was against the wind, I had a 5 iron in.  Putted about 15 feet, made that for birdie.
MODERATOR:  Birdie on 7?
LINDA ISHII:  Birdie on 7, I hit a 6 iron to about 12 feet.
MODERATOR:  Bogey on 13?
LINDA ISHII:  Bogey on 13, that was the par 3.  Oh, I chunked my 8 iron and picked it up, had it about 8 feet for par.
MODERATOR:  Birdie on 15?
LINDA ISHII:  Birdie on 15?  Hold on.  15.  What is 15?  Oh.  Yeah.  I hit my drive, had about 120, hit a 9 iron about, I don't know, less than a foot.
MODERATOR:  Birdie on 14?
LINDA ISHII:  Birdie on 14.  Oh.  Driver.  My dad's wedge to about 15 feet.
MODERATOR:  And birdie on 18?
LINDA ISHII:  On 18.  Oh, I almost pulled that one.  Driver, 3 wood, I had about 100 yards (indecipherable).
MODERATOR:  Okay.  You shot a 68 today, one off the lead.  Do you want to talk about your round today.
LINDA ISHII:  My putter was working well today.  I hit    my driver was kind of iffy, but I made about    you know, a lot of 50 footers and I had the last    oh, it was the last putt on 9th hole was, I don't know, 25 feet for par and I made that.  So my putter was definitely working today.
MODERATOR:  We'll open it up for questions.
Q.  Are you happy with your game today?
LINDA ISHII:  Very happy.  Yeah, very happy.  Absolutely.
Q.  (Indecipherable) first day is always a little bit of nerves (indecipherable) after today's round?
LINDA ISHII:  I hope so.  I mean, I never shot a 68 on an LPGA event.  So hopefully I will think about that and go for another round.  And a good round, hopefully.
Q.  What about the (indecipherable?)
LINDA ISHII:  I don't know.  I had a lot of lucky shots and I made a lot of putts, so no complaints whatsoever.
Q.  (Indecipherable?)
LINDA ISHII:  Absolutely.  I love Canada.  Definitely.  It's a beautiful place.
Q.  Did you have any trouble getting into Canada, getting to this tournament?
LINDA ISHII:  No.  Actually I drove over from Toledo, which was two days of driving, but I had no problem getting in at all.
Q.  How was the wind out there today?  It seemed like it would be a little bit tricky on this course with the trees and hills and that.  Were you
LINDA ISHII:  The wind?
Q.  The wind.
LINDA ISHII:  It started picking up in the back nine, but overall it wasn't too bad.  I'm sure it's getting worse now, but it wasn't that bad.
Q.  (Indecipherable) tell where it was coming from or
LINDA ISHII:  It kept on switching, so, yeah, it was kind of hard to figure it out at times.
MODERATOR:  Any other questions?

Thanks, Linda.
LINDA ISHII:  Thank you.
