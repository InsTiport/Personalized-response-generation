  MODERATOR:   Rocco Mediate shot a 2 over par, 72 and is 3 under for the Championship.  
ROCCO MEDIATE:   Yeah, yeah, who cares?   It wasn't my fault.   The rough got in the way a few times.  
   
 Q.   Couldn't do any catching up today?   
ROCCO MEDIATE:   I drove it crap.   I really did.   I drove bad today.   It's funny.   I hit good 3 woods off the tee, great irons, when I had out of the fairway and on the par 3s, I just drove it terrible, and that's what happens.   You can't do that.  
I got out‑‑ it actually wasn't a bad score for the way I drove it.   I just missed a lot of fairways.   You can't do that.   So I got what I deserved.   Maybe tomorrow, we'll drive in all the fairways.   You never know.  
I know what it is.   I just didn't do it.  
   
 Q.   Riegger's backed up a little bit.   Some guys shoot lower to close it up.   
ROCCO MEDIATE:   That's usually what happens.   Tomorrow we'll see.   You never know what's going to happen.   Michael's playing fine.   Same with me.   He just missed a couple shots, missed a few putts.   You can get a couple over quick on these things.   So he's playing just fine.
