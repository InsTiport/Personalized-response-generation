Q.  Rocco, after the Nissan it's been a struggle for you, how did you find the magic today?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  I've been hurt for almost two years, since Deutsche Bank two years ago, I've been a mess, and I was trying to recover.  I saw some things at Booz Allen, which is another tremendous golf course, which pleased me.  Coming in here I was pretty excited to play.  I didn't know whether I was going to shoot two or three under par yet, but I knew I was going to have a chance to play.  It's been a long time since I had a chance to play good.  You go out there hurt you don't have a chance with these guys.  But if I do a bad job, it's not because I can't move, it's because I hit a bad shot.  I can handle that, it doesn't bother me.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  Everything is great.  I haven't had a problem for months now.  I changed a lot of my golf swing over the last seven months with Mr. Ballard.  And I've been working for a month on putting.  And to put it out here in this competition it was fun today, because a lot of times it worked.  Sometimes it didn't.
Q.  Did you actually have fun out there today?
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  Yeah, it's just so hard, I mean    I make an eagle on 10, and I get to 3 under, I guess, and one of the hardest holes in the world you have to play next.  That's the beauty of The Open, that's why I love it.  It's always been my favorite tournament, period, always.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  I had a good drive, and I think I had 260 something out of the front.  I don't know if I could really    I hit a nice 3 wood and I walked up and it was right in the middle of the green.  I'm just trying to lag it down.  I've had at least 50 feet, I guess, right in the center, it was kind of funny, because those are the ones you're not expecting to make.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  I'm surprised.  I have to remember how to do this.  I'm very pleased.  I finished the round good, and that's what I really wanted to do, because those last few holes can get you, after you make a mistake.  You have to finish it here, but here it's just so hard.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ROCCO MEDIATE:  Have you ever led in a
Q.  Have you ever led in a round at the U.S. Open?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  I don't think so.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  Ballard is The King, he took all the heat off the spine.  It's been amazing what he's done for me.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  A couple of weeks ago.  I bring all the new stuff to the hardest tournament in the world.  If it worked today, there's no reason why I can't keep doing it.  You have to deal with it here.  I hit a couple of drives, I knew I missed the fairway, and two I thought I missed and I hit.  That's just what happens.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  You know, I always think the first day of any major is going to be the easiest, I don't know why.  I mean it seems like it's that way.  It's a little softer, especially in the morning.  It definitely was softer, but it firmed up, and tomorrow we'll get the firmer conditions in the afternoon, like the guys had today.  But it wasn't easy by any means.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  No, I was just messed up, I was just a wreck.  It just wouldn't    I couldn't    I got in really good shape again, this is Rocky VI.  So, I'm excited.  I couldn't be happier, I was having a blast out there, trying to do what I've been working on the last seven or eight months.  And I looked up and it was going most of the time where I was looking.
Q.  Did this get where you couldn't walk?
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  A few times.  Last year at TPC    I was there by myself, and I went in the    I got downstairs about 7:30 and I was    I have a little like trophy case in the hallway, at the house we used to live in in Jacksonville, and it grabbed me and I went down.  Well, no one came home for three hours.  So I couldn't move for three hours.  I couldn't even breathe.  And then a couple of weeks later it was better.  It took a long time.  But a lot of people    we all have our problems out here, believe me.  For three hours I couldn't get to my phone.  It was awful.  Of course my wife laughed when she got home.  She said what are you doing, just crawl up the steps.
