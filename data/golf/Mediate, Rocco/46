  Q. Rocco, you just finished at 2-under par. Before I ask you about your round, I have to ask you about when you line up your putts. Is that like a mini Villegas?  
 ROCCO MEDIATE: No, I can't put pressure on this knee. I can bend it and everything but I can't squat. If I do anything that Camilo does, I will break in two. There's no mini anything there, no.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about your round today?  
 ROCCO MEDIATE: It was fine. It's hard. You're always angry at the last hole if you miss a 10-footer but I made a bunch of good putts today, so I can't complain. I would have taken it before I teed off, trust me.  
  
  Q. We've heard a lot of players that the conditions today, you have to keep it in the fairway.   
 ROCCO MEDIATE: There's no question, especially guys who aren't strong like me, you have to keep it in the fairway. Palmer got the course set up exactly how I like it, exactly how he likes it, so you've got to really play this week.
