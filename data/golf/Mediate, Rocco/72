   ROCCO MEDIATE:  Three bad drives today and I was lucky to make five.  Just three bad ones.  I played okay other than that, a lot of good iron shots, good putting. 

 Q.  You continue to move forward -- 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  You can still hang with one of these.  It's got to be 66 or 65 or 67 to have a chance. 

 Q.  Talk about the conditions out there. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  Beautiful this morning.  I started off really good.  I made a little mistake on 15, did a complete 270.  It happens.  I hit a bad drive on 18, bad drive on 2.  Those were the only two bad ones and I was lucky to make 5s. 

 Q.  Great birdie on 7 to get you into red numbers. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  Yes, I hit it close on 7; hit the flag on 8, hit in the bunker, up and down; 9, just hit it too far, too aggressive. 

 Q.  The guys in the afternoon? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: There will be no grass left after this afternoon. 
 Just a couple of balls kicked a little too far to the right.  That's going to happen.  But it was a good day.  I just hit two bad tee shots.  I was lucky to make bogey.  Just a couple bad shots today, and you can't do that around here, and I did a couple of times.  I'm fine.  (Inaudible). 

 Q.  Talk about that, are you still in it? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Sure.  Probably 13 under will be leading after today.  I'm fine to be playing at all. 

 Q.  Is your back feeling all right? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  The back is good. 

 Q.  Do you reel any added pressure going into the weekend in the final group? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  No, been there. 

 Q.  Bad drives? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  I just blocked them both.  I actually blocked one on 18 and hooked a little on 2, and I was toast.  Made a good bogey, if there's such a thing. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 ROCCO MEDIATE:  It was windy today, but not much seven, eight miles an hour, but the golf course, everything is good.
