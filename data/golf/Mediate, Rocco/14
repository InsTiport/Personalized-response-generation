  ROCCO MEDIATE: It's perfect.  There's no most part at all.  It's the perfect setup.  There's not one single thing wrong with this golf course.  It's fantastic.  High rough, fast greens, firm.  It's perfect.  Nothing you can say about it.   Q.  I notice you have a pretty nice shot on 11, real high, a wedge in your hand.  You had a nice one to about six, seven feet.  ROCCO MEDIATE: Yeah, I played pretty good today for the most part.  A couple of bad tee shots cost you here, and that's just how it is.  You're going to do that here.  You're going to miss.  If you don't miss, you've got a chance.  I missed a few, back nine, and it cost me.  That's how it is.   Q.  I know we talked in the past about Tom Watson, you and him.  Just kind of you're more surprised when he doesn't play well.  ROCCO MEDIATE: Yeah.   Q.  Than when he does.  So a few general questions about Tom and going into the final British Open next month.  ROCCO MEDIATE: That will be awesome.  I wish I'd be there.   Q.  Yeah, having played with him on that Thursday/Friday.  ROCCO MEDIATE: Yeah, I did actually pretty good there.  That was fun.  That was fun.  Norman played good during the first couple days, remember?  He was leading through two rounds, I think.  Yeah, you know, those guys don't forget.  They don't forget.  Tom is just, he's the man.   Q.  How do you explain his dominance in links golf over the years?  ROCCO MEDIATE: He never really changed much.  He's just good.  He putted good.  He hit it through the wind.  Didn't hit it under and it kind of went up and said, that's in there.  He was a bad-ass.  I mean, five of those things.  It was unbelievable.   Q.  What's a memory that stands out for you, Rocco, you and Tom over the years?  ROCCO MEDIATE: The 2 iron he hit into Birkdale in '82, '83, '84 -- '83.
