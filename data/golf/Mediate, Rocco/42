 Q. Just talk about your round today and the conditions. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: It was windy. I made two mistakes on both 3s in the back and got lucky one to make 4. But it was hard to play. 
 I putted really nice, drove it. You have to play good to get it around par. So I played solid today.

 Q. You're happy with the first round?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Absolutely ecstatic. [Indiscernible] started talking to me about putting a little bit. I haven't been doing it much. And went back to the short putter, and I got into what he was saying. And that's been killing me, putting. 

 Q. Most difficult greens?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: They're hard. But growing up on poa in Pennsylvania, they're up there, but it's tough.

 Q. Do you think that's the hardest part of the course, aside from the wind?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: That's the hardest. We know it's 10 percent less. When the wind is blowing, it's hard to figure out what the hell's going on. A lot of funny shots going on down there. One flew into the bleachers on 17. Beautiful with an 8-iron right into the bleachers. I flew mine [inaudible] it was a hazard. And it was one of those things you have to deal with it somehow.

 Q. That must be pretty scary?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Oh, my gosh. And I just chipped mine and I pulled it a touch. But I was dead. I made a 5. It happens that quick out here if you're not careful.

 Q. PGA Championship next week?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Not in.

 Q. A win here would be huge for you?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Would that do it. 

 Q. Yeah.
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Then I'll be in.
