 Q. 1-under par today. Just talk a little about your round? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I didn't play -- these fairways are hard to hit. When you miss them, it's hard. So it was one of those days. 1-under par is fine the way I played. It's better than the way I played, actually.

 Q. Talk about was there any banter out there? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Oh, yeah, yeah, we always talk. We're always talking. It's a normal day. Always good to be with Tiger. Always a special day for me.

 Q. And a special place for you? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Yeah, it was fun. I haven't seen him. We haven't played since '08. He's looking better. He's looking better. He is. He didn't made a couple of putts, but he hit a lot of good ones.

 Q. And your thoughts on you for tomorrow? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I'll be fine. It's one of those days where you just miss the fairways, and what do you do? This rough is good. The golf course is set up well. So tomorrow actually they're much wider fairways. 
 But it's just one of those days. I can't go oh, my God. It's no big deal. I've just got to go tomorrow.
