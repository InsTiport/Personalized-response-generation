Q.   That's some very strong play?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  Yeah, solid.  I just -- I tried to hit a big curveball with the 5-iron.  We thought 4 just might be too much and I just didn't quite do it. And then I three putted from the right side but it's all right.

Q.   Two rounds at 67 have got you in contention for tomorrow?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  Yeah.  I don't know what the man's up to but but if you're five or six behind going into tomorrow, there's not much of a shot, but you never know.

Q.   The course?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  The course is absolutely outstanding.  I mean it's so good it's ridiculous.  The greens are perfect.

Q.   Anybody's catchable, aren't they?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  Yeah, but he doesn't come in that category.  Anyone else but....  You know, if he's six or seven ahead, no; but if he's two or three ahead, of course....  I don't know what the score is right now.  I really don't know.

Q.   He's at 17 right now?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  So he's four ahead of me, you know.  If he makes another birdie it will be tough. Unless I shoot like 64 maybe I don't have a chance. But there are a few guys in front of me too.  I mean it will be more than just two or three; I don't know.

Q.   Was it more difficult today?
ROCCO MEDIATE:  No, there is nothing going on.  I mean nothing.  Just a perfect day to play.
