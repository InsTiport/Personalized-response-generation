 Q. Inaudible? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: It was really cool. People are looking for that. You've got to try and give it your best shot. People thought I was supposed to lose but I didn't feel that way. Depends how I play. 
 All players want to play good going up to it, and U.S. Open was a couple weeks ago -- and I want to keep playing with some degree of consistency, so that if I do make it, I can contribute. 

 Q. Talk about today and making the cut, going into the weekend. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Resting would have been nice, too, but I was just mentally -- I don't know how they do it. Today I felt much better, got some sleep and played a little bit better. I love it here and really wanted to play the weekend, and got friends here. 

 Q. Teeing off in the afternoon instead of the morning, did that help? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Yeah, may not have been able to wake up.
