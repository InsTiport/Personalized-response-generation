  Q. Plus 7, you may have to sit and wait a little bit, but that was good playing.   
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I don't know. The golf course is so nasty right now. Just nasty.  
  
  Q. What is so hard about it?  
 ROCCO MEDIATE: The pins are really tough to get to, the wind is blowing and the greens are cooking, drying out.  
  
  Q. Are you glad you're done?  
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Very glad. Very glad.
