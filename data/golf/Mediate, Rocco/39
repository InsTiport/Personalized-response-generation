 Q. Just the experience of playing with Sam, obviously you have a great relationship with Arnold Palmer, talk about the day playing with him?
 ROCCO MEDIATE; We had a blast. If he is the future of our TOUR, we are in good shape. First of all, he's a sweetheart, but man, can he play. Wow. I knew he was good, but seeing him play a golf course like this which really brings out your strengths and weaknesses, absolutely fantastic. 
 We had a ball, absolutely. I played okay. Some of the clubs hitting into these holes are ridiculous, but it's something, though. He's a good boy. He's got it figured out. He's got some good people behind him, too. 
 The thing about him that probably no one noticed that I've noticed is his irons are kind of normal, which is a huge advantage. He's not trying to hit 6-irons 210, he's hitting them 185 yards. He'll be fine, because I didn't see him trying to overdo anything. He's got a huge future, huge. 
 We had a ball. He kicked the crap out of me, but what are you going to do. I got him by 25 years, what are you going to do.
