Q.   Talk a little bit about your round today. 
ROCCO MEDIATE:   It was solid tee to green, crap on the greens. 

Q.   What effect did the kind of rain delay and weather have on the course?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   It takes a little bit out of everybody's momentum, if you have momentum.   If you're playing, like not good, it's good.   If you're playing good, it's like, oh, heck, I want to keep going. 
I played okay coming in, but not great and I would have rather, obviously‑‑ but that's how it works.   It's no big deal.   You just got to deal with it and it's no big deal.   At least we got back out in a couple hours and the third round will be finished today and we're back on schedule.

Q.   How are you feeling heading into the final round?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   Well, I'm back way.   I'm playing good this week, but I haven't made my putts.   It's that simple.   And next week, hopefully, I'll make more.
