Q.   First of all, the conditions out there today, what was it like?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   The course was brutal today.   Great test, but these things, all these Majors are all about controlling the fairways and greens, otherwise you're done here.   This place is a hell of a test.   I remember it, but it's better now, I think, since Rees came in and re‑did it.

Q.   Your first round as a senior in a Major, 2‑under. 
ROCCO MEDIATE:   I will take it.   I would have taken it before I played.   There was some wind, and the rain wasn't a big deal, but it was just nasty.   It was hard.

Q.   Any holes stand out?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   Well, 6, 5 and 6 back to back were pretty nasty.   6 was really nasty.   The 3‑iron shot to that back pin was ‑‑ it was all over the place with the wind, so it was good.   I'm going to go hit a few putts and take it easy a little bit.

Q.   How good do you feel at 2‑under on a day like this?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   Oh, sure, I would have taken it before I even started.   Anything under par is fine.   Majors, under par, around par is not a bad thing.   I don't care where they are or whose playing.   And this golf course just, it's just going to get harder.   So you just got to be on your stuff here or you're going to get killed.

Q.   Are you going to bring your over coat in the morning?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   I don't know, how cold is it supposed to be?   Oh, whatever, we deal with all that stuff for years, so we'll see.   I got plenty of sweaters.
