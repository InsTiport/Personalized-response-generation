  ROCCO MEDIATE: 262 to the front.   Carried on the front.   Rolled back 20 -- I don't know how far away.   Coming, coming, the putting.   I haven't put a 65 by my name in a long time.   I'm working my tail off.   That was a huge sign.

Q.   You are going to be playing this weekend and --
ROCCO MEDIATE:   No. I just wanted to keep doing what I was doing.   I want to get clean today.   I haven't made a double this week.   That's it.   I'm happy.   I'm working on a lot of stuff.   I'm staying with a couple my buddies, Mike Murphy, Big Break. 
He used to watch me play since 2000.   We were hitting balls the other day.   What -- changed a couple things in my set-up.   "You never did that."   "What am I doing?" 
Squared me up a touch.   It's been a lot better.   I've driven most of the fairways, a lot of greens and my funny shots aren't at funny as they used to be.   So, Murf helped me a lot. 
Those are the people that can really see what you sometimes -- I'm pretty good at it but it's like God, I didn't realize I was setting up like that.   It's crappy.   So, we worked on it for like ten minutes.   Putting is another issue.

Q.   Minor tweaks?
ROCCO MEDIATE:   It's pretty much all of it.   Something I'll call stupid.   That's the word I used. It's something that -- we lose that sometimes, you know, and with what I've gone through the last few years I've been all over the place.   It's coming.   Like I said, I think it's here.   We'll just see.   Weekend will be fun.   I'm not -- I'm just -- I don't have a lot of expectations.   I know what I'm doing, 27 years.   I can still do it.   I want to still compete were these guys.   I love it out here, love what I do.
