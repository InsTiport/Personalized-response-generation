 Q. Talk about your round out there. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Absolutely nothing. Funny, actually. I shot 71. I didn't embarrass myself today.

 Q. You mentioned yesterday you were tired?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I'm toast. It took a lot out of me. I loved it. But I need to get some rest the rest of the day and tomorrow morning.

 Q. Did you find that the banner with the fans was different, were there more fans?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: That was this morning, only probably 200, 300,000 fans following me (laughter). It was great. It was obviously louder. There weren't many earlier. Then they started picked up coming up on the back nine. Not just to watch me, but because more people are coming.

 Q. The whole thing is starting to catch up in terms of energy. 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Yes, I have noticed. Serious, my second hole today, I hit a 5-iron. It was like 25 yards further. Four feet behind. It's like blech. I wanted to play as good as I could. So I tried.

 Q. (Inaudible)
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I hope. I don't know. 

 Q. I know it was early still. But were there any boisterous people on 17?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: There was nothing. They were actually very nice on 17.

 Q. A surprise?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: There was nothing going on. The golf course is good. Everything is good.

 Q. Did you see the banner up there?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I did. I can't believe they did that. It was nice.

 Q. How does it feel to be a fan favorite? 
 ROCCO MEDIATE: I think it's cool. 

 Q. Is there anything specific you need for tomorrow?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Just rest. I hit it fine. It's fine. What's amazing, the roughs are a lot higher here this week. It's harder. Some holes couldn't even get close. The golf course is great. Nothing. I don't know, I'm so tired I can't even talk. You know I'm tired when I can't speak.

 Q. Are you mentally fatigued as well as physically?
 ROCCO MEDIATE: Both. I need some rest. I haven't been able to get some rest. I'll get it. I'm not complaining. I just need to get some rest.
