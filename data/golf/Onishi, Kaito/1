 Q.  So you've had experience here in some USGA events before and success at USC.  Do you think some of your experience there gives you an advantage here?  
KAITO ONISHI: Yeah, for sure, especially when we play NCAA on a really difficult course.  I think it gave me an opportunity to kind of go back and look into my game and work on every part of my game after that tournament.   
And all the tournaments we play are a very strong field, really good courses, so it's prepared me very good coming into a tournament like this where the greens are really fast, really long and you have to be accurate.  So I think two years at USC has prepared me very well so far and yeah, I can't wait for the next two.   
 Q.  Do you think, what do you think about Pinehurst so far?  Have you played here much?  
KAITO ONISHI: I played here when I was I think really young, when I was like 11, 12, U.S. Kids.  I do remember a few holes, but other than that the tees are probably all different, all the views are different.  I'll say it's harder than the NCAA that we had, considering, because it's just really long and the greens are really firm, but it's a great test for sure.   
 Q.  How would you rate your performance today and your round here?  
KAITO ONISHI: Yeah, I think I had a really good stretch on the front nine, I hit the ball really well, but my ball striking isn't really where I want right now, it isn't my best.  So I think considering all that I think I played pretty well.   
Hopefully, it's No. 2 tomorrow, so it's a tougher course, so, yeah, hopefully I hit it better tomorrow and we'll see where I stand after that.
