Q. Thoughts on a very good score in what were quite challenge conditions?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: It was very tough.  It was very windy out there.  So I was just trying to make pars and hit greens.  I started with two birdies on my second and third hole, and I've been playing good.  So happy with the score and let's see tomorrow.
Q. How did the two nines compare out there?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I mean, both nines, there are some holes into the wind.  Some par 4s, they are playing short because of the wind.  But I think played better the back nine, which they were my front.  I think similar.
Q. You've played here before?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I played last year.  This is my second year.
Q. Did you speak to any of the guys?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: One of the caddies said he caddied for Renato Paratore, so I'm good friends with him.  So I talked to him and he said, yeah, the course was playing firm and nice links golf course.  I think it's helping me that I played last year.
Q. I saw you at the U.S. Open saying, because it was tough conditions on the Friday there, and you were saying the tougher, the better.  Do you feel like that here, as well?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I feel the same because at the end you have to be mentally strong.  You're going to hit shots that you're not going to like.  You're going to make mistakes, bogeys and you're going to miss short putts.  So I think the stronger you are mentally, you have an advantage.
Q. Do you work with somebody on that or is that something you do yourself?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I think it's just my family.  We are very sporting.  My uncle used to play football, and I think the just not giving up, yes, keep fighting.  Some people they get tired of fighting.  I just try to give my everything all the time and then whatever happens, I'm happy with that.
Q. Who did your uncle play for?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Athletic Bilbao.  He's a coach now, JosÃ© Angel Ciganda.  It's my dad's brother.
