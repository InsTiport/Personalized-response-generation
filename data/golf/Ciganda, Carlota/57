 Q.  Very well played this week and today.  It looks like it won't be quite enough to take the win but nevertheless, probably a top three position.  What are your thoughts?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I mean, I played good.  I played enough birdies to be up there.  I made a few bogeys, a bogey on 10 and 11.  Those two were tough, same as yesterday.  Overall I'm happy.  Played solid this week and I think I'm ready for next week.   
 Q.  Were you leaderboard watching?  Did you know that maybe an eagle at 18 could have been enough to force a playoff?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I was playing with Mi Hyang Lee, and I think she was leading -- Karrie Webb was leading and then Mi Hyang was 5-under.  I was I think 3-under on 18.  So I had no chance.   
I mean, I tried my best but it wasn't enough.   
 Q.  Great preparation for next week.  You're playing so well at the moment.  You couldn't be more confident for next week, I should imagine.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I have to work on a few things but I'm happy with the way I played.  Shooting under par on the weekend, I think that's always good, and excited for next week.
