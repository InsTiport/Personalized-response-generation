Q.   Obviously not the way you would've liked it to end.   What happened with that shot into the last playoff hole?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   The last one?   The one I hit into the water?

Q.   Yeah. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I just pull it.   I wasn't very comfortable with the wind.   I knew it was the club, but I just hit too hard and just a little bit too much left and just to the water.
Just missed one shot and not the right way. 

Q.   Did you ever debate playing it out of the hazard, or were you always going to take the drop?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   It was very tough, very tough, because I couldn't go back, I couldn't go forward.   It's very tough shot.
So I just tried to chip it in.   Lydia hit an amazing second shot, 2‑putt, and easy, easy win.

Q.   With the putt on the playoff hole before that, was there anything to it?   Misread?   Mishit?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I think I just pushed it a little bit.   I was right edge and still a little bit more, so...

Q.   Overall this week though, made it to a playoff and gave yourself a pretty good chance to win.   Solid Sunday.   How do you feel about the week? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, I'm very happy, because I wasn't very comfortable before coming here.   I saw that I can be up there.   I been playing really good, putting much better, so I'm happy with my result. 
Hopefully I can win next year.

Q.   Does this give you momentum going into next year, any confidence?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, yeah, I can't wait to keep playing out here and really enjoying.   Yeah, very happy. 

Q.   And then finally, what are your plans for the off‑season?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I'll be home.   Home and rest in Spain.   I'm going to play Dubai in two weeks, and then I'm going to take it easy a little bit.   Then I'll start again and maybe start in Florida.
