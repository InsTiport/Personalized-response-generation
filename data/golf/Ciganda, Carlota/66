 Q. How does it feel to finally be playing here in Rio?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I'm very happy to be here. I've been here for four days already. I've been going to other sports and very excited to start on Wednesday.   
   
 Q. Did you watch any of the men's golf?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA: No, I didn't see a lot but I watched basketball, tennis. I watched Rafa play for the Gold Medal. Then I watched synchronized swimming.   
   
 Q. What do you think of the course?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I think it's a cool course. You have some long holes, some shorter ones and with the par 5s, I think it's going to be fun. Obviously if the wind blows, it's going to be a little harder.   
   
 Q. Are you staying in the athlete's village?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yes, that's an amazing experience, everyone there, you are just thinking about which sport, and it's just a lot of fun.
