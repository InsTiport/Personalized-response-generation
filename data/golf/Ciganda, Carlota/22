Q. 5-under 66.  Hot round.  Good way to start.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, thank you.  I mean, quite happy with the round today.  Was a little windy so I don't think it was that easy this afternoon.  I wasn't feeling great since yesterday, so I'm just trying to hit every shot as well as I can, being very patient.
And today was really good, so very happy.
Q. What part of your game would you say was the strongest?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I hit it really good off the tee so then I have short irons to the flag and then I made some good putts.  I think everything was working pretty well.
Quite happy with the whole game, and hopefully I can do the same the next few days.
Q. This is your second start of the Marathon Classic.  How does this course suit up for you?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I really like it.  It reminds me of back home in north of Spain where I'm from.  The course is very similar with trees and doglegs.  I think it's a ball striker's course.  You have to hit it really well.  I like that.
Yeah, it's in great shape.  Lots of people here, so I think it's a great event.
Q. Earlier tee time tomorrow.  How does that affect your momentum?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I like to play late to have some more time to rest.  It is what it is, late, early.  It's nice to play in the morning, too.  I think less wind and the greens will be better.
So I'll try to go out there and keep playing well.
Q. You were able to score pretty well today.  Going into tomorrow, what part of your game you would like it sharpen up?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I mean, I would like to keep hitting fairways that way I can have short clubs to the greens.  That's really helpful.
I'm putting pretty well.  I think if I hit these fairways I'll be fine.
