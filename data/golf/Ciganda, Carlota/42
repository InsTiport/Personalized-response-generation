Q. An impressive tournament for you, obviously you haven't got the win but you've come very close.  What are your thoughts?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I'm happy the way I played.  I always enjoy playing here in the U.K.  I think it's a good week to prepare for The Open for next week.  I'm happy the way I played and excited for next week.
Q. You've had wind, rain, sunshine, pretty much ticks all the boxes that you wanted?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, you can get four seasons in one day here.  We had great weather the first two days.  It was good, a good course, very happy.
Q. Looks like you're the only player in the entire field who has gone under par each day so that must be an extra confidence boost.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I think I haven't been making many bogeys, hitting lots of greens.  Playing solid.  I think it's good for next week.
