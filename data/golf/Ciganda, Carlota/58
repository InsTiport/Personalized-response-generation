 Q.  An exceptional score, you must be delighted.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I'm very happy the way I played today, especially the front nine, I thought it was really tough and really windy.  I started with birdies on 2 and 3.  It helped on the par 5, they moved the tee up.  It was a little shorter today.   
And then yeah, I was just trying to hit fairways, hit greens, make a few putts.  I bogeyed 5 and then birdied 8, and then I had two bogeys on 10 and 11.  So I was a little pissed there.  But then, I'm like, just keep playing and it's just a grind.  So I just to just keep fighting, and then two birdies on 14 and 18.  So happy with the round.   
 Q.  You're playing so well at the moment.  That birdie on 18, as well, that could be crucial going into tomorrow.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, especially, I mean, it was a short par 5, because the tee, they moved it up, too.  I knew I could hit it on in two.  I was like, if I get one here, it's going to be good, because I mean, two or three shots on this course, I don't think it's much.  Especially with the wind and tough conditions.  It's going to be fun tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've been so consistent this week.  I guess that's one thing that must be really pleasing for you.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I've been playing good the last week, so I'm just trying to be patient.  Try to stick to my plan.  Yeah, I'm having a good time out there with my caddie, Terry.  I'm learning a lot and he's teaching me so many things.  I still have lots to learn, but I'm having fun and I'll try my best tomorrow.
