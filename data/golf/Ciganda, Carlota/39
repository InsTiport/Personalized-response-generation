Q. A slow start to the week but a sizzling finish, five birdies in the last eight holes.  What went well for you today?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I like this course.  At the beginning of the week, I was still jet-lagged and I was tired, and also a little bit of -- took me a little bit of time to land here in Korea but then on the weekend, played very solid and good on the par 5s.
I'm making lots of birdies, so I think that's very positive.  Still I feel there were mistakes but overall I'm happy with how the week went.  I have three more weeks here, so I think it's a good start.
Q. So you're playing Shanghai next?  Blue Bay?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Shanghai, Taipei and Japan.
Q. What are your goals remaining now for the season?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I want to win.  I mean, I would like to win at least one event and just keep playing.  I mean, try to hit lots of greens, lots of fairways.  Make myself lots of chances.
Q. Based on your form over the weekend, you're taking great momentum into those last few events?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I'm happy the way I played.  Yeah, the par 5s, hitting the ball good, long.  I think if I keep doing this, I'll be close.
