Q. Another round under par today.  What went well?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I mean, hitting the ball good.  Lots of fairways.  Maybe not as many fairways, but lots of greens.  The front I been playing good.  Birdie on 2 and 3.  Good birdie on 9, 10.  Then with 15 I three-putted from very short distance.  That was a little bit painful.
Good three holes to finish.  Hitting the ball good and excited for tomorrow.
Q. I think you had a good par save on 8.  Was that important?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, that was really good.  I hit it right and had a bad bounce in the bunker, really bad lie, so I just hit it on the green.  I was happy.  I made a really good putt.  Really good save.
Birdied 9 so I had some momentum going there.  Birdied 10.  Then I don't know what happened.  Then just made many more pars but still 3-under so pretty happy.
Q. I think it was Founders Cup we were talking and you were leading and you mentioned you prefer to chase.  Tomorrow you'll be chasing Nasa just two shots back.  What's your strategy?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I am in a good position.  I'm going to try to get to 16, 17-under.  I think that will be a good number.  Just keep playing.  I think I'm doing lots of good things, especially for next week.  So, yeah, keep playing my best, try to hit lots of greens and see what happens.
