 Q.  Tell us about your round.  You played great today?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Thank you.  I think I've been very consistent.  Hit a lot of fairways.  Hit the driver really good.  I hit lots of greens as well, 15 greens.  So very happy with that.  I didn't make many mistakes.   
Par 3s I didn't hit the greens, but I made one par, one bogey.  Played well on the par 5s, on 5 and 9.  I was on the green in two so I made two birdies with two putts there on each hole.   
The back nine, I had a few chances, made a few putts, also four pars.  So I think under par in a U.S. Open is always good.   
 Q.  What was the best part of your game today?  Was it ball striking, putting, driving?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Ball striking was pretty good, yeah.  Good drivers.  They were long.  My putting is very consistent.  Everything.   
 Q.  Did the course play to your expectations the way you had looked at it in two practice rounds?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.  I mean, the course, it was a little more windy than I thought in the morning, so it was playing tough.  But the holes into the wind a but little long, like No. 1 and 2 with the back pin.   
Then the par 5s, they were reachable so that's a little easier.  But I think the pins, there were some easy ones, some tougher ones.  So I think for our first round, the course was like a good setup.   
 Q.  When you get under par, do you become a little bit more aggressive to try to pad some -- get yourself ahead of people?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I like that, yeah.  My nature is playing aggressive, and I like that.  And I think once I'm 2 under, want to get to 3.  Once I'm 3, I want to get to 4.  That's what I always try.  Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't, but that's how I think, and I just -- I like to do that, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you have a strategy going in of which holes you want to be agressive on?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I think the par 5s this course you can be a little more aggressive.  With good drivers, you can get on in two.  I think par 5s are reachable for me.  Par 3s are tough on this course.  I think if you can make three pars, very good.  And then the par 4s, some of them are easier.  Depends on the pins.   
If you can make two, three birdies on the par 5s and play even on the par 3s, I think you should be good for the week.
