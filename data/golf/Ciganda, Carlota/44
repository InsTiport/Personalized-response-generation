Q. What a great round were, but what a tough finish for you today.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I mean, it was tough.  I just (indiscernible), and just wanted to knew where the ball was going.  Yeah, just hit it to the right.
Overall I think it's a great week.  I mean, I was thinking even not playing this tournament, going home and rest, so I'm happy the way I played.  Lots of birdie; lots of good shots.
Today my putting was very good, so very happy with the way I played.
Q. 22-under and nine back.  You ever imagine anything like?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I know.  I mean, when I came they told me that you have to shot a low score here, so I tried my best, tried to fire all the pins and make as many putts as I could.
I mean, if someone plays better, just congrats and nothing I can do.
Q. What do you think about what Sei Young is doing out there right now?  How special is that?  She is a part of what could be part of the all-time record in any event?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: It's unbelievable the way she's playing.  She's a great player.  I play with her many times.  She have a great caddie, too.
Just one of those weeks that everything is going in.  To play that good, I mean, you have to play every shot pretty good.
I'm just happy for her.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Q. Do you think the course needs to be tougher?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I mean the par-5s, they are reachable, so lots of birdies there, and then the greens are very soft.  So at the end we were coming from a major event that's really tough, so people is playing good after a few weeks in a row.
So, I mean, I don't like this every week because I like tough courses.  Once in a while I think it's good to get some confidence and to play courses like this.
But, yeah, I think to get it how it has to be a little bit longer and then put the greens a little harder, too.
