 Q.   What's your assessment of today?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, I don't think I played that bad.   I just miss a few putts.   I hit 35 putts.   It was tough, a few 3‑putts out there.   And then 1‑over on the par 5s, and I was on each of them in two on the greens.   There is one more day tomorrow, I will try my best.  
It is one more day and anything can happen in golf.   I'll try my best.   Try to play good shots and good golf tomorrow.   I have to be very patient out there.   We will see how it goes.
