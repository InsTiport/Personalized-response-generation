CARLOTA CIGANDA: (Recording in progress.)  I really like the course.  I didn't make enough putts.  Yeah, it was a shame.  I hit a good shot.  It was a little long, the pin was long, so I just three-putted because I had a lot break.
So it's not like I hit a bad shot.  It's just I hit the wrong club.  But I've been playing good and hitting the ball good, so happy and excited for the weekend.
Q. You said you wanted come in, have some fun, but also focus on your strategy.  So far, you feel you've achieved that?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.  I mean, I think we been going good.  I mean, yeah, we know the course.  I need to make some birdies on the par-5s, and then a few more.
There are some tough holes if you can make par it's good.  I think we're doing good.
Q. What were conditions like today?  Was it quite breezy out there?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I think it was less than yesterday.  Today was nice; yesterday was cold.  The ball wasn't flying much.  Today a little bit sunnier; a little less breeze.
Q. Final question:  What was the best part of the your game today?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Maybe my second shots and my putting.  I mean, the wedges and the putting were good today.
Q. You're defending champion.  You're in a pretty good position heading into the weekend.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Thank you.  Yeah, I'll try my best.
