Q. 7-under.  How nice is it to get off to a good start here?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, very happy.  No bogeys.  I play really well hitting also greens.
Yeah, I mean, I been playing good the last few weeks, so, yeah, I'm happy with start with that 7-under.
I mean, the scores are low here.  I didn't play here last year, but they told me that finish around 20-under, so I'm just trying to play and make a few putts.
Yeah, I'm very happy.
Q. Do you have a number in mind with this golf course knowing that the winning score was so low last year?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Not really.  I'm just trying to play my game and make a few putts.  I don't want to have a number and put some pressure.  Just go play, have fun, and then we will see where we're going to get to.
Q. Yeah.  What was it on the front nine, your back nine today?  You really caught fire.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.  I mean, on the front I started playing good too.  Hit my fourth, I think No. 13 2-under par, I three-putted, and then I hit a few good shots and make two birdies.
Then on the front I just hit it really close; play good the par-5s.
So, yeah, I made a good few good putts, too.  Yeah, 5-under on my back which was the front, so...
Q. You'll take it.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.
