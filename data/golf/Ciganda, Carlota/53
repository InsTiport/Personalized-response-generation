Q. Did you feel like Lizette's hot start affected the momentum at the beginning?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yes, she started with three birdies, so that was tough.  I didn't play good.  I had a bad day.  It's just golf.  I'll try to play well tomorrow.  They played great and they deserved it.
Q. What are you going to go do now?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I'm going to go, yeah, cheer with my teammates, and hopefully we're going to get one or two points and we will see.
