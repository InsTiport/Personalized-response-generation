 Q.  Probably a difficult morning for you, right, having to come back and finish one hole?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: It's fine.  Yesterday I couldn't sleep.  I just wanted to come today and finish the round.  3-under, happy with the round and ready for the second one.   
 Q.  Did you get enough sleep last night?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Not too much.  We went to the hotel, had some food and straight to bed.   
 Q.  How about your overall play?  You finished 17 holes before the delay.  How about your play on those holes, how did you feel about that?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Pretty good.  I mean, 4-under for 17 holes, I think if I do that for the rest of the week, I think I will be fine.  Just happy and try to give my best golf.
