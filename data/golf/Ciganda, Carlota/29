 Q.  Sum up the week.  Good week.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, very happy.  I would've love to win.  Always special here in Phoenix, but I couldn't today.   
I play good.  I mean, (indiscernible) two par-5s on the back; bogey on 11 kill me a little bit, but try my best.  I played aggressive, which is my nature, and made a bogey there.   
Then hit good shots.  Just wasn't as control with my putting on the last few holes, so I didn't make any putts at the end.   
But overall just a great week.  Lots of birdies, not many bogeys, three bogeys for the week, so pretty happy.   
 Q.  What do you take away from a week like this where you came very close?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball very well, hitting lots of fairways, lots of greens.  I think I just have to keep doing the same, giving myself chances, and I think the win will come soon.
