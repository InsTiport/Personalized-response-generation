Q. The reception at the first tee was something exceptional. Never experienced one like it before. What was that quite like for you?
BRONTE LAW: It was incredible. The crowd cheering for us and getting behind us was amazing. And when they finally went quiet was when it really set in, I think. But just tried to take some deep breaths, focus in and hit a good drive.
Q. Carlota, you've been through a few of these. It was special on the first tee. That's something I've never seen before. Have you?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yes, (indiscernible), first hole and the ones that I played. And the fans are just unbelievable here in Scotland, so polite, so nice. (Indiscernible) she did great this first match. It's always nice not to (indiscernible).
Q. Did you have a strategy that you actually talked about before you went out? Your first point, it's so important -- you know how important the first point is. Did you have a strategy or was it just take seat of the pants sort of thing?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I (indiscernible) the way the course is, (indiscernible) best you can. And we played pretty good. (Indiscernible) balls on six and seven that we made two (indiscernible) and I think very solid (indiscernible) -- and I think that's really good score.
Q. You love match play. I've seen you play in match play, and you love it. That was a topsy-turvy match if there ever was one, yes?
BRONTE LAW: Yes, obviously we took the lead early on, but you know they're always going to come fighting back. And I think we really held them there well. There was a couple of really clutch putts that we had to make to stay in the match that were definitely pivotal in us getting that half point.
