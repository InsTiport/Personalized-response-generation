Q.   What is it that makes you such a great match play player?   What's the difference between playing match play and medal play in your mindset?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I love match play.   I love playing for my country, playing for my friends.   My goal was just to get the point, but just play my game.   It doesn't really matter if you hit a bad shot or a bad hole in match play, you just go and play. 

Q.   Do you think it frees you up knowing you can make a high number on a hole without being out of it?   Does that help you free up your game a little bit?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, I think I play much more aggressive here in match play than when you play medal play.   If you make a double or something, you just move on.   It's only one hole.   But you just need to make pars and a few birdies.   But I think you can learn from this.
