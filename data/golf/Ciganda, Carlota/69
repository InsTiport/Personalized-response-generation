CARLOTA CIGANDA: Very good.  Very happy.   
 Q.  Well played.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: We made an eagle.  We finished 4-under in the last three holes.  So happy.   
 Q.  Well played and best of luck this afternoon, guys.  
MELISSA REID: Nice to make a birdie and then obviously one better on the next hole, hole a 9-iron and then huge birdie on 18.   
 Q.  How about that shot yesterday?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I hit it so good.  It was such a great match.   
 Q.  Yesterday obviously we had to stop because of darkness, did you want to play on?  
MELISSA REID: We would have played on.  I played in darker conditions.  We didn't really know what was going on, they just drove off, the Americans.  So we were kind of sitting at the tee for a while.  It is what it is.  Luckily we came out, wanted to make birdie on 18, which we did.  Couldn't have asked for much more.   
 Q.  That was really a point shared, but it was almost a point won in the position you're in?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Making birdie you can only win or tie.  So happy.
