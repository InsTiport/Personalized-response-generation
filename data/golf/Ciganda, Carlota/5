  Q. Carlota, what a great third round.  Started off on 1 and then bogeyed No. 3; went straight into birdies all day.  When did the momentum start for you?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, I think my putting was very good today.  I made a really good save on 7 and that was kind of key, a good par there.
 Great birdies on 4, the par-3, and then 6.  I was almost two on the green.  Then, I mean, I didn't hit the ball as good as yesterday, even the day before, but I think I made some really good up and downs, two birdies coming in, 16 sure 17.  Such a shame I'm not birdieing 18, but it's great round.  4-under, and I'm happy.
 Q. How long was the par save on 7?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   It was maybe six, seven meter, like 20 feet.
 Q. Oh, wow.
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   You.
 Q. And you've birdied holes 4 and 6 every day this week.  What is it about those holes?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   4 is on a really good looking par-3.  I like when the par-3 is like high and you're hitting it low to the greens.  I really like the way it looks.
 And 6 I just hit really good shots.  Long par-5.  Hit to two days on the green.  Today was just short of the green.  The pin was on the front.
 So, yeah, made a really good up and down there and -- I like long par-5s, so, yeah.
 Q. And then do you mind talking to us about the course conditions today?  Some players said it's drying out a bit and that's changing the conditions.  How do you think it played today?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I think it was pretty similar, to be honest.  I think the wind was switching a little bit.  We thought it was coming from the southeast then from the east, so I mean, on the front nine you are in between trees so I don't think you can really feel much.  On the back nine it's different because you have the lake and it's more open so you can feel the wind a bit more.
 I think the course is in great shape and I think it was pretty similar to the last two days.
 Q. And what are you thinking about tomorrow?  Probably the same time but maybe different weather conditions with a little bit of rain coming in.  Are you at all concerned about that?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   No, I mean, whatever happens it happens.  It's the same for everyone.  I'm just happy to be here playing, and I'll try my best, keep the strategy clear, and try to go win this tournament.
 Q. Lastly, lastly, hopefully maybe a fun question not so much related to golf.  There is so much happening in this world right now.  Is there anything you're eyeing particularly, maybe in the news or a TV show?  Apart from golf, what are you focused on now?
 CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I'm always thinking about my family.  I like to see them doing good and I talk to them every day.  Luckily they are healthy, they are fine.  It's crazy times.  I try to meditate, go for runs, and just try to stay way from all the news.  I know what's going on, but I think I don't want to be like every day watching the same thing because it can be quite tiring.
 To be honest, it's just so nice to be playing golf tournaments.  Such a great place here in Lake Oconee.  Hopefully we can get a title sponsor and have a tournament here in the next few years.
