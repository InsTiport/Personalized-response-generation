 Q.  Another good round and a classy finish as well with those two birdies.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, I'm really happy with this rounds, especially no bogeys.  That was very good.  I been playing good the last two weeks, in Korea last week and this week, too.  Gave myself lots of birdie chances, and I'm happy where I am.  I hope I can win tomorrow.   
 Q.  It's going to be an exciting group to follow; a lot good players at the top.  Just feel like you're ready to pounce?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I want to win.  I want to win because I didn't win last year, so I would love to win.  I love playing in Asia.  It's good for long hitters, playing quite long, so I'm quite comfortable.   
 Q.  You look particularly comfortable over the putts.  Really striking the ball very nicely.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I been putting pretty well, and I think it's important on this course because you can have some long putts if you are not in the right area.   
Yeah, I'm happy the way my game is feeling, the way I'm putting, and I'll go tomorrow and fight and have a good time.
