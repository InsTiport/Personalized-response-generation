 Q.  It was an unbelievable match.  Probably not how you wanted to finish on that last hole, but you both had seven birdies.  You must be pleased with how you played?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: It was a great match.  I knew I had to play well to beat Lexi.  She has been playing well the whole week.  I had two rough holes, but I think I'm pleased.  Half point is good.   
 Q.  You must have been pretty cheered to find you were going out first, having that much confidence in you to go and play?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I like to play first.  I like to go out and try to get that point and then go support the team.  I had a feeling she was going to play first, I don't know why.  We made so many putts in the first six, seven holes.  I think it was a great match.  I think it was great fun and I'm happy with the way I played.
