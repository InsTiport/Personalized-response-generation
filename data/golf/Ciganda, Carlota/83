Q.   Overall impressions with the match. 
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   We played pretty solid from tee to green, but not until the end did we start making putts.   But at the beginning, we made a stupid bogey, both of us being with the 3‑putt and I didn't make up‑and‑down.   And that kind of got us 1‑down.   I don't know.   We never really recovered from that.   We just didn't make putts today.   In match play, you have to. 

Q.   You started off strong today, the first, what, five holes or so.   Is that when the momentum started to switch at that point or did that come later on in the match?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   I think it did when we lost, I think it was 7.   On 7, we lost.
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   We had a putt to win the hole there and 3‑putted there.   And it's really important to make putts in match play.   I think we played very similar to them, maybe a bit better, but you need to make putts and putt good. 
So today it didn't happen.   So hopefully tomorrow the putts will go in.

Q.   Heading into tomorrow, do you feel like you'll change things up?   Have you discussed it yet?   Or stay the same?
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   We're going to stay the same.   We just didn't make putts today.   But obviously, I mean, we enjoy each other's company a lot out there, so we don't want to change that up. 
So again, as long as we make putts tomorrow, we should be fine.
