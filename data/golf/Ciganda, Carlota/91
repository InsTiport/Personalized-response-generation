Q.   How does it feel to get that point back on the board for Europe?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Very happy.   Very happy because it was a tough match.   I was just trying to do as well as I could. 
And I was putting good, and my second shots were good too.   So I was 1â€‘up after nine, and then I made a few birdies on the back nine and I'm just so happy to help Europe to win the match.

Q.   Being a rookie, please describe this Solheim Cup experience. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   It's unbelievable.   You need to be here, and you need to do it.   Because when you come here, you won't feel it anywhere else.   So, I'm so happy that I'm part of the European Tour, and everyone is just so nice here.   And I'm just so happy that we can win the Solheim Cup. 

Q.   You saw some parts of the course that I hadn't seen before, how did you get out of them?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I was just trying to play my game and I was very comfortable, but I just tried to fight and say, let's keep it going.   And my caddie was really good.   He was telling me, let's have confidence and relax, drink water.   So that really helped me and I'm really happy.
