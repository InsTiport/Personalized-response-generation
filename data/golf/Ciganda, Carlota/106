Q.   We did a story on you a couple of months ago when you just flew to Lake Geneva for two days or something like that. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah.

Q.   So it was worth it?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah.   Of course it was.   I played qualifying.   So it was great.   It was a great course, great people over there, and it was a beautiful place, so we stayed for three days.

Q.   Oh, you did?   Right on the lakefront there?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Uh‑huh.   Yeah.

Q.   Okay.   And is it true that you literally left pretty much as soon as you finished the 18th hole and got on a plane?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Uh‑huh.   I played on the European Tour this year, and I had to play in Germany, and I was playing there the following week.   We played very slow.   We took, I think, ten hours to play 36 holes.

Q.   Really?   Ten hours?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yes.   Five hours and five hours.   Played 18 and then 18.

Q.   Oh, sure.   Then you drove to O'Hare?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yes.

Q.   And then flew to Hamburg?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   We flew to London and then Munich.

Q.   Oh, gosh.   Were you exhausted?   I know you're young. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   No.   I was fine.

Q.   Okay.   How did you do today?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I played really well.   I had a five‑footer.   I was even par for the front nine and hit a lot of greens and I made an eagle on the second hole.
And then I bogeyed tenth, and then I was even par and then 3‑putted 14, and then I finished (inaudible).   And I played great.   But it's the U. S. Open, so it's hard to score.

Q.   Did the wind start out predictable and then start swirling around a little bit, do you think?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I think it's playing hard today, yeah.   The wind was moving a lot, and a lot of shots it was changing a lot.   It was the wind behind then was hurting.   It was hard to play. 

Q.   Are you wearing green and gold because you like green and gold or do you know ‑‑
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I like it.   I like colorful stuff.

Q.   Okay.   That's a popular color in Wisconsin, too?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Is it? 

Q.   Yeah.   Because the football, American football team here.   But I wondered if that was a coincidence. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I didn't know that.

Q.   Do you have any goals for tomorrow besides the obvious?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I would like to shoot under par.

Q.   Okay.   Does that mean being more aggressive in certain areas?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah.   I'm playing good, yes.   Drop some more putts.   And I made two doubles, so I think if you're going to make bogeys, no doubles.   That's important.

Q.   Was there any wind at all out here earlier in the week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or is this the most?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Today the most.

Q.   Does that just put enough doubt into your mind on club selection?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   No.   I don't mind.   I hit the ball very low, so I think it's playing hard for everyone, but I don't mind playing in the wind.

Q.   One other question, too, I was just wondering, where is your home base if you're playing in Europe now?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I live in Spain.

Q.   You do live in Spain.   So you just travel to every tournament?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yes.   We leave on Monday to Europe and I'm playing Evian and European Tour because I got the full card there.   So I'm going to play in Europe this year.
I went to qualifying last year, thought I could play two, three tournaments.   I finished 32nd.   So I just want to play the full time in Europe.

Q.   What do you think overall of the course?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   The course is great.   I mean I think the fairways are ‑‑ I think they are narrow.   If you hit it good, you can be in the fairway easily, but then you need to be very, how do you say, precise on your second shots to the green, because if you miss the green, it's really hard to make up and down.   The greens are very hard and then the rough is big.
