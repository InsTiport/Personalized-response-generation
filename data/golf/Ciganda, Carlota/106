 Q.   After the build up, how was it out there on the course?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA:     I played good today, 2‑under to start the tournament.   I made a birdie on the 8th hole with a par, so 1‑under on the front nine, and then made a birdie on 13 and bogeyed 14 with 3‑putts and then finished with a birdie so at the end, 2‑under, and I played well.   I hit fairway, lots of greens, but I need to try to hit them closer tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How do you approach the week, because you're so close to winning the Order of Merit.   Do you approach it like a normal tournament and try to win the tournament, or are you watching what Caroline is doing?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA:     No, just try to play my game and try to do what I know and what I can.   I love to play golf and just trying to stay in the present and hit every shot at one time, and I mean, today she played great and I'm happy for her, and then tomorrow is another day, so we try to play our best tomorrow.
