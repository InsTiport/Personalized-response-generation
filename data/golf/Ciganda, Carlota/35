CARLOTA CIGANDA: I mean, it's just four days, no cut.  No worries.  Just go out there, play, try your best, and that's what I been trying to do the last few weeks.  I mean, I think everything, my putter been good, my tee to gree game, too.
I think today those drivers I was hitting very good.  I had short irons to the green, and I think it's big in this course.  I'm happy with the score.
