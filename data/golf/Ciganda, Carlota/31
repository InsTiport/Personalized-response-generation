 Q.  3-under par second round.  Hitting it this nicely, is there anything you can work on between now and tomorrow afternoon that you think is going to help?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: To be honest, I'm pretty happy the way I been hitting it the last two days.  I even think I hit it closer today.  I didn't make as many putts, especially on the front nine, but I'm happy.   
I mean, I'm hitting the ball great, hitting lots of greens, having fun out there.  Very happy.   
 Q.  These greens are very pure.  They're oftentimes tricky to read.  Do you find that is the case?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, the course is in great shape.  The greens are really, really nice.  Will be nice tomorrow with less players.   
But, yeah, they are very nice.  Sometimes a little tough to read.  A few tricky pins today.  Yeah, it's great.  I think the weather is going to be good for the weekend.  Excited to keep playing and making birdies.   
 Q.  In Thailand you came very close.  Do you play your best golf when you're out front or chasing?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I like chasing.  I like to be behind and start making birdies.  To be honest, I'm just thinking about myself, trying to play my golf, hit lots of fairways, as many greens as I can, and then make a few putts.   
I have to make a lot of birdies, but, I mean, just keep playing, be very patient.
