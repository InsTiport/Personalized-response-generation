Q. Five birdies and two eagles.  You inserted yourself into the conversation.  How pleased are you?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I'm very happy.  I mean, I been playing really good all week.  I had a really good off-season with my coach and I had lots of practice, so I am happy to see these results.
I hit lots of greens, hitting great shots, great numbers, and then today the putting was hot.
Q. You got off to such a fast start - eagle, birdie, birdie - and then when you on 15 chipped in for eagle, were you aware of the situation, that you had a share of the lead?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I wasn't.  To be honest, I was just playing my game, and I saw that Amy was 21-under at that point.  I just wanted to get to 20-under.  I thought that would be a good score for today.
Amy is playing amazing.  We'll see what happens.  I'm real happy with the round, happy the way I play and the way I'm playing, and excited for next week.
Q. You just shot a round of 63.  You're a pretty cruisy kind of person.  Surely your hear is beating a little bit faster now.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, yeah, of course.  I mean, the last few holes mentally you have some nerves.  It's so hot here.  It's hard to think also in this heat.
Yeah, I think we good did a great job with my caddie James.  Yeah, very happy.
