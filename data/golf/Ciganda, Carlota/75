  MODERATOR:   Like to welcome Carlota Ciganda to the media center who sits at 7‑under for the tournament after a 5‑under round today.   What's been working for you this week? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I been playing really good the last two days, and I think my putting was key today, hitting really good putts and making a bogey‑free round.
Yeah, felt very confident out there off the greens.   I think it was nice to play on the wind.   It was tough today. 
MODERATOR:   We were talking on the walk up here that last week you were back home in Spain and got play and JosÃ© MarÃ­a OlazÃ¡bal.   What was that experience like, and what was it like to play with a two‑time Masters champion? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   It was a great experience.   It's always really nice to play with someone like him.   He's such an unbelievable golfer.   I called him, and I was struggling with my putting.   I was like, Can you please give me a lesson?   We stay there like three hours on the putting green just hitting putts.
He told me a few things and it seems like it's working, so I'm pretty happy.   I have to thank him.
Then we played last Friday before coming here, so it was really nice to play a match with him.   He's so passionate about golf.   It's just his life.
MODERATOR:   Would you consider him one of your golf mentors then? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   It's been more lately.   Maybe the last two years I played with him, but I didn't have any more lessons.   Yeah, it's always inspiring, and you can always learn so many things from a player like him.
MODERATOR:   You've been in this position before, up near the top of the leaderboard going into the weekend.   What it going to take for you to come away with your first LPGA victory? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I'm just going to try to play my game out there and try to enjoy myself and just keep playing the way I'm playing. 
I don't want to think too much about winning or finishing top 5, top 10.   Just keep playing one shot at a time and enjoy myself. 
MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   The three hours on the putting green, can you elaborate a little bit on what you learned? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah.   I had trouble on my left‑to‑right putts.   I was cutting the ball.   We worked on alignment, put everything more square. 
I got a new putter, more upright.   It was too flat, my putter.   So he told me a few exercises, and I'm just trying to do that and feeling better.

Q.   So you played a match against him?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah.   It was one of my friends that he plays in Challenge Tour and me.   We played best ball against him.

Q.   How did you do? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   We won on the last hole, but it was tough.   Yeah. 
MODERATOR:   Speaking of Jose, who are some of your other golf idols?   Growing up in Spain, probably Seve.   I know with the International Crown you have a lot of national pride in Spain.   What's it like? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, always like Sergio.   Sergio I mean, is always one of my idol.   I always follow him.   Sometimes I have the‑‑ I can play with him sometimes, so it's really nice to play with these Spanish professionals that won so much and play Ryder Cups and won so many tournaments.
Sergio and then Seve.   Of course he was unbelievable.   I don't have lots of memories from him playing.   But, yeah, I'm good friends with his son.   He's such a great guy.   Yeah, Seve, Sergio, and OlazÃ¡bal.

Q.   Do people in Spain find Miguel Angel Jimenez as interesting as the Americans do?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Maybe here more.   I think in Spain it's more OlazÃ¡bal, Sergio.   But Jimenez, too, because he's quite old and he's playing so good now, much better than many years ago.   So I think he's a great player, too. 
And he's funny always with the cigar smoking.   He's a fun guy to watch.

Q.   On your round.   I know you're happy with your position, but do you feel as though you haven't taken advantage of the par‑5s as much as you would've liked to?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, I didn't make many birdies these two days on the par‑5s, but instead I made another birdies on the par‑4s, and even par‑3s hitting good shots.   At the end, the most important is to make birdies whatever you can do.
Yeah, I would like to make more birdies on the par‑5s tomorrow and Sunday.   I just don't want to think about that too much.   Just keep playing and whatever it is, it's fine.
