Q.   Looks like you have won the ISPS Handa Order of Merit.   How do you feel right now?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Unbelievable.   I have work and I'm very lucky and very happy to have won the Order of Merit and I just want to be with my family, with my friends, and it's been a great year. 
I want to congratulate, also, Caroline, because she has been playing great and she's a great player.   Even if she won, she's doing great and I'm very happy for her, too. 

Q.   Were you watching the last few holes?
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yes, of course I was just trying to focus on my game but you have the scoreboard and I could see she was playing well.   And then I was in the clubhouse with my family and friends watching, and she played great.   But it wasn't enough to finish second, so a great tournament for her and happy for me that I won. 
Very happy to have won both in the same year, and I mean, it's a great year, and so happy for everything, and, I don't know, I have no words. 
It was a good score to finish and I'm really happy with my year and now I just want to be with my family and friends. 

Q.   You are the second player after Laura Davies to win two titles; tell us about the next year, what you can achieve. 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Just want to try to keep playing as best as I can, focus on the present.   I just want to have a break now and then I will start practicing in January.   This year I had no expectations and it was good so I'm just going to try to enjoy every moment, stay in the present all the time and just have fun playing what I love. 

Q.   Are you happy with your result? 
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yes, it was a good week.   Yesterday wasn't a great day but three days under par, and 9â€‘under total, I think is always good. 
It's golf and anything could happen and I'm aware Caroline was playing great.   She has her LPGA card and I wish her the best.
