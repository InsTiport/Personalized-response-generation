Q. You made a fantastic start today.  Four consecutive birdies that got you right back into contention.  Obviously not the back nine you wanted.  Was it a case of maybe pushing too hard?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: No, I just hit a bad shot a bad shot on 12.  I mean, I don't have to worry too much because I've been playing great.  Started pretty good the front nine, and then 16 was a tough pin, and here I just tried to hit it to the green; I missed it.
I mean, just a couple of mistake.  I've been playing good, and I think I have to take the positives, and next week.
Q. As you say, for a title defense you're in contention.  That has to be rated a success this week.
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I try my best.  I like the course.  I wanted to play good.  Yeah, it's a great course.  I love playing here.  I think its greens were harder today.  Course was playing tough.
No, I think I have to learn and keep going.
Q. How are the crowds today?  They know their golf.  They know you are the defending champion.  Did you get some special treatment?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I mean, lots of fans yesterday and today, especially having the Koreans out there.  So I think it's really good for both, for us and the Korean crowd.
