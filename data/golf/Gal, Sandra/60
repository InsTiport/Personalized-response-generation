   MIKE SCANLAN: Can we go through your scorecard, birdies and eagle and bogeys? Birdie on 2, what did you hit into the green?   
 SANDRA GAL: All right. Let me focus here. Oh, okay. Actually, I hit a 7-iron left of the green in the bunker and made it up-and-down from there.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. Eagle on 5.  
 SANDRA GAL: I left it short and then I chipped in.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: How far was the chip do you think?   
 SANDRA GAL: It was about 12, 13 yards.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie, 6.  
 SANDRA GAL: I just hit it really close to about three feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 8.  
 SANDRA GAL: Number 8, oh, that one. Yeah. I hit it close, three feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 10.  
 SANDRA GAL: Number 10, I hit it close to like a foot.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 11?   
 SANDRA GAL: I hit it to about seven feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 12.  
 SANDRA GAL: Ten feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey on 13?   
 SANDRA GAL: I three-putted.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: How far?   
 SANDRA GAL: About 25 feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey, 15?   
 SANDRA GAL: Three-putt, from about 35 feet. Maybe 40. I'm not good at feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: We'll say 40. 16?   
 SANDRA GAL: 16, about four feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: All right, Sandra. Nice round out there. 7-under. You're tied with a lot of people for second place right now. If you would, just talk about your round. You really started hot with a few birdies and that eagle and ended up having a nice little day.   
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah. Definitely, as I said, I started off well, and just wanted to keep it in the fairway, more or less, and if you hit it close, you're fine.   
 And I left a lot of shots out there. It's a course that you can go low right now.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Questions?   
  
  Q. I guess the thing would be if you had a little bit of a slip-up on those holes, what did you do to kind of play yourself out of the funk where maybe you could have ended up at 3-under and get back into it?  
 SANDRA GAL: I just told myself I'm playing great and I'm not going to let it bother me, and just keep shooting at the pins, and keep going for it, you know. Don't lose the aggressiveness that I've been doing so well on the whole day.   
  
  Q. I see on some of your recent events you've been playing better, at least as far as the finishes. You've had a couple of top 20s. Do you feel like maybe your game is coming around where you can be a contender just about every week?  
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah. That's definitely how I feel. I've been working on my short game. And that's been paying off right now. I don't see as much pressure hitting into the green because I know I can get it up-and-down from anywhere. So that's been helping a lot.   
  
  Q. And has your problem been the putting? You mentioned the three-putts. Has that been maybe the thing you have to shore up to make the step?  
 SANDRA GAL: It was just getting late in the afternoon, and one of the three-putts I had was really bumpy and it was shadows on the green, so I kind of misjudged the distance. Otherwise I'm really comfortable with my putting.   
  
  Q. A few players that played in the afternoon were mentioning that the winds were picking up and the greens were getting bumpier. We had a ton of scores that were 8, 7, 6 and obviously not quite as many in the afternoon. Was that the case, that the conditions were a little bit more difficult?  
 SANDRA GAL: The wind didn't really bother me, but as I said, you just have to hit it close and you have a better chance of making birdies, obviously because it is getting a little bumpier in the afternoon. Yes.   
  
  Q. Did you play here last year?  
 SANDRA GAL: I did.   
  
  Q. Just talk about your comfort level at this course. It's only your second season on Tour.   
 SANDRA GAL: I enjoyed last year a lot. I was leading for a while, and then I didn't have a good round and I finished off well the last day. So I really like the course.   
 I feel comfortable here, and the people are great. The fans are so nice. So it's great to be out here.  
  
  Q. How about all the players who have had very low scores today? What does that say about the quality of the field that's at this tournament this year?  
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah. You can definitely see it's a very deep field. Scores are low, but it's just the first day.   
  
  Q. You're in a handful of players who came out within the last few years who are high on the leaderboard. Talk about the recent influx of the young talent on Tour. And seems like the younger generation, I guess is pretty well represented today.   
 SANDRA GAL: Yes. Definitely. I think it's great because we need more competition, we need better scorers, better players, and that's how we get up with the guys and make golf more attractive.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Anything else? Thank you so much.  
 SANDRA GAL: Thank you. Appreciate it.
