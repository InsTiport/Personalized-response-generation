 Q.  Awesome round, final round of Thailand.  Finish at 7-under for the day.  
SANDRA GAL: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  You birdied, what, six of your last seven holes?  
SANDRA GAL: That was my front nine.   
 Q.  Okay, so front nine.  
SANDRA GAL: Yeah.  Just got off to a really hot start.  Yesterday I actually was struggling just to get my ball striking the way I wanted, and I send a couple videos to my dad and he had a little tip and that really helped me.   
Just had a good attitude.  Some of the putts fell, so it was so fun to start the year off that way.   
 Q.  Yeah, and a good way to end the week.  
SANDRA GAL: Yeah.   
 Q.  What did your dad tell you to change?  
SANDRA GAL: Just basically my setup.  I didn't change anything.  I just got a little sloppy with my setup or just didn't notice what I was doing.   
So that was pretty easy fix this morning.   
 Q.  How often do you do that, sending videos to your dad?  
SANDRA GAL: Well, he's on the road quite a bit, but when he's not I'll do that pretty much if I need help, so for sure it's great.   
 Q.  What are you looking forward to the rest of the season?  
SANDRA GAL: Just looking forward to better ball striking.  I worked really hard this off-season to get some more distance and get my swing better.  Seeing that come to life on the course in tournaments is super, super fun.   
 Q.  How did you like playing in Thailand this week?  
SANDRA GAL: You know, the course is amazing.  The heat is just, it's tough for everyone.  Some people do better and some people worse.  I'm just getting kind of used to it every year just a little bit.  Coming from Germany it's not like our favorite weather, but we like hang in there.   
It was good.  I had plenty of energy today, so I was just happy about that.
