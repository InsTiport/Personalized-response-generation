Q.   How do you like your position and your chances? 
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, I really like my position.   I mean, that's where you want to be coming into the weekend.   I mean, I know it's a late weekend, but Sunday is going to be a lot of golf.   I'm feeling really good with my game.   I don't want to get ahead of myself because staying in the present is more healthy.   I just really want to keep enjoying my shots.   I've been really good with staying in the present, so I just need to do that tomorrow. 

Q.   Did you even look at a leaderboard because it's crazy? 
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, I kind of did.   I did look at the leaderboard, and my group was playing really well.   I know I saw the group behind us, they're all up there.   But yeah, it's going to be really tight, though.

Q.   Is that the way to approach it when there's so many players?
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, I think so.   I'm just going to have to play aggressive.   You can't protect anything.   Someone is going to shoot low, so I might as well just go for it.
