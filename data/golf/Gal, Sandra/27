 Q.   Here with Sandra Gal.   5‑under at the end of round two.  
    SANDRA GAL:   4‑under.   Well, no, I'm 5‑under, yeah.  
   
 Q.   4‑under for today; 5‑under after two rounds.   Talk us through your round, please.   
    SANDRA GAL:   I actually had a really nice day today pretty much all day long.   Yeah, just missed a couple putts here and there.   Could have been a really good round.  
    But I'm happy with it.   Just took a couple weeks off so I'm easing into tournament golf and really to golf sometimes.  
    So it's been a good day.  
   
 Q.   What's the plan for tomorrow?  
    SANDRA GAL:   Plan for tomorrow, you know, I'm not setting any score goals.   I really just want to focus on keep hitting great shots and maybe getting a little bit more, you know, couple better reads on the putts, and that's it.   
   
 Q.   Is it your first time playing in tournament?  
    SANDRA GAL:   I played last year.  
   
 Q.   What's your perspective on the Reignwood LPGA Classic?  
    SANDRA GAL:   This year I think we've been lucky not having so much of the smog.   I really like the golf course.   Yesterday you could see how beautiful it is with the mountains all around.   It's in good shape, so I think I everyone is enjoying it.
