 Q.  You played very well here last year, and good to see you strutting yourself again?  
SANDRA GAL: Yeah, absolutely.  I just feel really comfortable on this course.  I don't know what it is.  I think the wind definitely makes it a little challenging but it also makes you focus a little better.   
 Q.  You played well earlier in Hawai'i, the LOTTE Championship where it was also very windy conditions.  What is it about the wind that equips your game so well?  
SANDRA GAL: I think it forces me to use my feel a little bit better versus just hitting shots to certain numbers.  So I don't really count too much how, for example, certain shots will play yardage-wise.  I just feel it more and see the trajectory.  So I think that really helps me.   
 Q.  It's a big set of tournaments here for the Asian swing, a very important time to be playing well.  
SANDRA GAL: Yeah, absolutely.  It's a time of the year where you can move up the rankings a little bit but it's also a bonus to be here.  So I think we're just happy.  The sponsors take really good care of us and it's always beautiful courses.  It's a little bit of both.   
 Q.  What would a great finish mean here to you?  
SANDRA GAL: It would mean a lot to me.  I had a really good year, probably the first third, and then I had a little bit of a slow summer.  So I'm hitting the ball much better now which I'm really happy about.  A nice finish would mean a lot to me.
