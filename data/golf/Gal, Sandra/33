  SANDRA GAL:   You know, I just really, really hung in there today.   I didn't hit a lot of greens.   I made up‑and‑down from everywhere and then I was lucky to roll in a few longer putts and I just stuck it out till the end.   I had to chip out on 18 and I hit a nice little pitch shot close.   That's about how my game was all day

Q.   Probably going to be the best finish in at Open.   What do you take away from it?   Maybe did you snag like a key or something this week?
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah.   Well, I think just leading up to this event my game started to get a lot better and more solid, and I think the key to it ‑‑ I'll probably keep that to myself.   I think it's just less thinking and more playing and really enjoying out there.

Q.   When you're playing well, what's going well?
SANDRA GAL:   My putting.   I think what really turned it around was my putting.   I did change putters last week to a Metal X Callaway putter, and I started rolling it really nicely with it and I think that really, really helped me this week.

Q.   How do you play at a major at a tournament like this where Na Yeon had such a big lead?   What's your thought going into the final round of a situation like that?
SANDRA GAL:   I mean it was a bit frustrating because it was hard to catch up with her unless she had a really bad day, which I'm not hoping for anyone.   On this golf course once you're six shots behind, it's hard to make it up.   So basically it was just a battle for second or third.
