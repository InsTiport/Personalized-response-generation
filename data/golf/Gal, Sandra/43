 Q. Sandra, hard luck today, disappointing end of the week? 
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah, definitely disappointing. I just had such a hard time hitting good shots with the bad weather in the beginning. And I just went down so early. 
 Brittany was playing great. She was under par in the worst of conditions. I just didn't make any birdies, you know.

 Q. You got half a point through three matches in your first Solheim Cup. Are you happy or disappointed? Did you expect more from yourself? 
 SANDRA GAL: I'm disappointed for sure, but I have to say the whole week was such a great experience. I enjoyed every minute of it. I don't think it gets much better than this.

 Q. It looks like it's going to go down to the wire. Are you going to go out and support the girls?
 SANDRA GAL: Yes, I'll give them my best.
