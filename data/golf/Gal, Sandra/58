   SANDRA GAL: It was very tough conditions out there. But I felt like I played steady and kept my ball in the fairway most of the time, and that shot was very nice. I just tried to get it up as high in the air as I could, and it came out perfect. It couldn't have been better. 

 Q. Where did your drive finish? 
 SANDRA GAL: It was in the rough, and I was thinking of hitting 5-iron or 6-iron, it was probably a good idea to hit the 6-iron because it was not that easy of a lie. I thought I would pull it left but I holed it well, it went to the right. 

 Q. With the time of night and the crowd and you're leading --
 SANDRA GAL: A few gutsy people out there still that were following, so that was nice. 

 Q. Leading a major, how does that feel?
 SANDRA GAL: You know, it's the first round. You don't win majors in the first round. But it's definitely always nice to be on top. 
 Lots of golf to be played, so I look forward to it. 

 Q. How was pace of play?
 SANDRA GAL: It was very slow, unfortunately. Yeah, I mean, you can't expect anything being out the second to last group, being so late. But can't change it. 

 Q. You don't have any Solheim Cup pressures, do you?
 SANDRA GAL: Unfortunately not. Yeah, I had a very, very short off year, so I decided not to play Q-School for the European Tour this January, which probably regret a little bit. I would love to play on the team. But I'm surely going to do that next year. 

 Q. Are you still at University?
 SANDRA GAL: No, I graduated last August. 

 Q. You can't join now?
 SANDRA GAL: The Tour? If I win. I have no idea. 
 If you have special play, that can make you a member, something like that. 

 Q. An exciting possibility. 
 SANDRA GAL: Yes, it is, for sure.

 Q. How long was your putt on 18? 
 SANDRA GAL: I would say maybe a foot. 

 Q. What time are you playing tomorrow? 
 SANDRA GAL: 10.42. 

 Q. Birdie on 7? 
 SANDRA GAL: Yes, I hit it to about 12 feet with a 9-iron. I hit a 9-iron to about 12 feet and made the putt. 

 Q. And 10? 
 SANDRA GAL: No. 10, I hit it to about 13 feet, made a putt and I hit a little punch 8. 

 Q. 11? 
 SANDRA GAL: 11, I hit a punch 7-iron to about seven or eight feet and made the putt. 

 Q. Bogey on 12? 
 SANDRA GAL: I made three putts, long, 50 or 60 footer. 
 15, I hit an 8-iron to eight feet, nine feet and made the putt. 
 I made bogey on the next one, three putts, again, 50, 60 feet into the wind. 
 When I made birdie, I hit 4-iron to about five, six feet, five feet, made the putt. 

 Q. You were born in Cologne, but how long have you been living in the U.S.?
 SANDRA GAL: Since college, so five years now. 

 Q. You grew up in Germany?
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah, grew up in Germany, went to high school there. 

 Q. Did you play junior tournaments there?
 SANDRA GAL: No, I played all over Europe really.
