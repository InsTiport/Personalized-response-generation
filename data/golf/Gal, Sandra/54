  Q. So just talk a little bit about having to go out there and start your round and not finish it, then go back and do it in the morning?   
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah, I'm actually fine with it. I'm a little bit sick yesterday and the last couple of days. I actually had breakfast and then I felt like going back to bed, so that's exactly what I did.   
 Playing nine holes was actually quite nice. I look forward to coming out tomorrow early.  
  
  Q. Do you feel better now?   
 SANDRA GAL: I do a little bit, yes.  
  
  Q. Is it frustrating at all? You kind of got hot the last two holes you played. Made three birdies in your last four. Is it frustrating to get on a roll like that and then have to stop?   
 SANDRA GAL: Not really, you know. I think I'll just have a fresh start tomorrow, and it doesn't bother me.
