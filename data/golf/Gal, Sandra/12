Q. (Inaudible.)
SANDRA GAL: You know, we still had an amazing week.  All the spectators were just incredible, cheering me on and cheering us all on.  So we can only take positives from this week.  I'm not going to be sad.  I think there was a lot of good stuff, and sometimes the putts go and sometimes they don't.
I'm happy for the Americans, they played really good golf this afternoon.
Q. How was it to go out there in this 12 match and know what was going on and catching up to Creamer?
SANDRA GAL: Yeah, you know, I played solid, I just didn't make any putts.  I made so many Friday and Saturday, but they just didn't want to fall today.  But that's how it is, and there's nothing I can do.  I enjoyed every second.
Q. Today there was a bit of controversy this morning.  Do you think that was an advantage for the Americans going out this afternoon being full of revenge?
SANDRA GAL: It's a possibility.  I can't comment on that, I don't know.  It's a possibility.  But obviously they just played better golf.
Q. Did you talk to Suzann about it?
SANDRA GAL: I did, yeah.
Q. What did you make of it?
SANDRA GAL: It's my personal opinion on that.  I think it's very controversial and I think everyone has to decide, you know, on their own, if it's right or wrong.  Obviously I'm going to stand with my teammates there.  But I'm not sure.  I wasn't in the situation to really know what exactly happened and how long the putt was.  So it's difficult for me to comment.  I don't know.
Q. Would you have done the same?
SANDRA GAL: That's a tough question.  I wasn't there, so I can't really answer that.  I wasn't there.
