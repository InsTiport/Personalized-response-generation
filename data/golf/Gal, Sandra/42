 Q. Great round, what was working out there for you today and kind of what were the keys for you out there? 
 SANDRA GAL: I think I struck the ball pretty well. Tried to hit a few close shots on my approach shots and made a few putts, a couple off the fringe, and you roll a couple in there here and there. I actually didn't take advantage much of the par 5s. I actually played them 1-over which is kind of strange. But there's always room for improvement, but I'm happy with the day for sure.

 Q. What do you think the key for you is going forward over the weekend to continue? 
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah, you know, I'm not going to look forward much. I'm just trying to really enjoy every shot and just stay in the present moment. 

 Q. Coming off your first Solheim Cup where you were a rookie, sometimes we can take momentum from different things; can you take any momentum from that?
 SANDRA GAL: You know, what I actually played really bad on Sunday. My team was the one that pulled it together. 
 But definitely, you know, the energy was so awesome there and the people were so supportive. And with the win for all of us, definitely that's good momentum coming in, yeah.

 Q. This golf course, are there any specific keys to doing well on this course?
 SANDRA GAL: There's a lot of different tiers on the greens, so you have to be on the right side when you approach the green. And they are pretty firm, too; so with the wind being a factor as well over the last couple of days, not so much today, it's really the iron shots that matter. 

 Q. And the speed of the greens, did you have any trouble, was it slower than you expected? 
 SANDRA GAL: It was a little slow at the beginning of the week but they actually sped up, so they are nice.
