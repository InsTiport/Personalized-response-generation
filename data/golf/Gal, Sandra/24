Q. Pretty solid round given the conditions.   Pretty pleased with it?
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, actually I am.   I felt it was a bit of a battle today.   It was just tough all round.
But I felt like I really hung in there and made a lot of up and downs.   It was really, really nice to finish strong with the birdie on 18.

Q.   Feeling good about your game heading into the weekend?   Been playing well recently.
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, absolutely.   Feeling good.   You know, yeah, I don't really know what to say.   I'm just drained mentally today.   I was really fighting hard.
But absolutely.   I hit lots of quality shots and hope to continue that.

Q.   How tough is the wind out there?   Stacy said it's really blowing across on a lot of holes and it's making it tough to judge the distance.
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, I think on some of the holes it was actually a little bit harder than it was yesterday, so she's right there.
A lot of the crosswinds, but also a lot of strong into‑ and down‑winds as well, which that makes it difficult.

Q.   Did the conditions get tough as the day went on?
SANDRA GAL:   I don't know.   I kind of went away for a hole or two and then came back strong for the last three holes.
Yeah, like i said, last nine holes or so the think the wind was a little bit stronger.
