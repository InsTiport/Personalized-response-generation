 Q. What's it like playing with her and how she played? 
 SANDRA GAL: Well, she played really, really solid golf. She seems very comfortable out on the course, very, very peaceful. It was great to play with her. 

 Q. How about you? Can you talk about your round today? 
 SANDRA GAL: I had a good round today. I played much, much better. I need to work on hitting more fairways, but I think the first five holes on the first day got me into trouble, and I've just kind of been catching up with that. 
But it looks like so far I'm in the cut, so I would absolutely love to play on the weekend. I'd hate to miss it by a shot. 

 Q. How has the course changed over the last three days? 
 SANDRA GAL: Yeah, it's gotten a lot softer. Fairways are softer, greens are softer. There's still a couple putts that are a little quicker, but it's playing easier.
