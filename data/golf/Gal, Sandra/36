Q.   It's obviously pretty hot out there.   What did you think of the conditions?
SANDRA GAL:   You know, I think we got a little preview last week in Arkansas.   It was pretty similar, so I knew how to prepare and what to do out there.   Obviously it was quite draining, but if you keep hydrated it's fine.

Q.   How did it affect the course?
SANDRA GAL:   The heat? 

Q.   Yeah. 
SANDRA GAL:   I don't think it did much to the course, to be honest with you.

Q.   Sandra, with the conditions a minus one at the U.S. Women's Open is probably something that you would have taken if somebody told you that a week ago; right, on the first day?
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, definitely.   I mean it's just a solid round, you know.   Did have a couple bogeys that kind of hurt, but you know, they'll come eventually, so you just gotta battle back with a couple of birdies and stay patient as you always do at U. S. Opens.

Q.   Did you feel a difference, did it cool down at all as the day went on for you or just because it was so long you just didn't really feel the difference?
SANDRA GAL:   Uhâ€‘huh.   Yeah.   Pretty much.   I think the last two, three holes it cooled down a little bit and it was a little shade there because the sun is setting, but it was a hot day, yes.

Q.   How much water did you drink?
SANDRA GAL:   I don't think I can count them on my two hands.

Q.   You tee off early tomorrow.   What do you think you have to do to take yourself from being in contention right now to maybe trying to grab your share of the lead?
SANDRA GAL:   Right.   You know what I'm going to do is have dinner right now and I think I'm going to sleep really well after this day and just go out and do the same thing tomorrow, one shot at a time and keep a positive out look.
