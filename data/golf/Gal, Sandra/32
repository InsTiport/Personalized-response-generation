 Q.   What did you do well today?   
SANDRA GAL:   It was a combination.   I think I kept it in the fairway and then I hit a couple of tap‑ins and then made a couple 10, 15‑foot putts.   So it was just a little bit of everything.  
   
 Q.   Did not making the Solheim Cup, did that affect you?   Did that inspire you?  
SANDRA GAL:   I was really disappointed, to be honest with you.   I tried to take it as a positive and just be more motivated for the rest of the season and for twoyears when it's going to be in Germany.   We're all real excited about that.   
It gave me an extra week to practice, so I worked hard on my game and hopefully it will show.  
   
 Q.   Did you watch?  
SANDRA GAL:   I watched, yes.   Of course I'm going to cheer my teammates on.   
   
 Q.   What would that mean to make that team and play in your home country in front of everyone?  
SANDRA GAL:   It would be unbelievable.   I think there are so many young girls coming up and just to see the excitement that's surrounds our biggest event for women's golf, it would be amazing to boost the sport.   And obviously being part of that would be just unbelievable.  
   
 Q.   66, is that your best round of the year?   
SANDRA GAL:   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you played the best?  
SANDRA GAL:   I've been playing really well recently.   I just haven't been making a lot of putts.   If a couple fall then I'm good.
