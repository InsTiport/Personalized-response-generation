Q. 7-under par.  Good way to open up your tournament.  How was it?
SANDRA GAL: It was interesting.  It was super fun, first of all.  But it was kind of interesting because I started off well, 2-under, then I made a double, went back to even, and then I made a few more birdies and another bogey.
So I think I made ten birdies, so that was super fun, seeing a lot of putts drop and hitting it close to the pin.
And, you know, also teeing off and seeing there is a 10-under out there, you're kind of chasing it a little bit.
Q. For all the work you did to get back after a couple of bad holes, it was a nice finish to roll that last one in, wasn't it?
SANDRA GAL: Yes.  I kind of probably should have hit one more off the tee.  I had the trees in my way.  Yeah, I was bummed when it hit that tree.  I was super excited I made that putt, the downhill left-to-right to make that par.
Q. How does your strategy change when you go out and you see someone has already posted a 10-under?
SANDRA GAL: Yeah, sometimes you're pushing it and trying too hard making birdies; I just try to not like be too pushy.  Just hit good shots.  Just kind of naturally flowed.  I think the whole group played really well; we made a lot of birdies.
We talked a little bit in between shots, so it wasn't that really in intense.  It was just trying to have fun and enjoying the flow of things.
