  Q. How did you feel out there?   
 SANDRA GAL: I felt really good, actually. Having Catriona by my side gives me a lot of calmness and confidence because you know you can rely on her. And I think we played really well together. She made birdies, and I didn't play that well, and I made birdies and she didn't have a good hole. So I think it was a good match up.   
  
  Q. Catriona, to be fair, there must have been seven or eight birdies in that game on both sides. It was a hell of game and a tough afternoon, as well, wasn't it?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, in these conditions, I think we birdied every hole on the front nine. Yeah, I mean a halve match. They birdied 16, 17, obviously, we were disappointed being 2-up with three to go.   
 But to make birdies on tricky holes like 16, there's not much you can do. I think Sandra played really well today, like she said, and I played not too badly on the front and kind of crumbled. And she helped me on the back.  
  
  Q. Like you say, there is not much you can do when they make birdies coming in, is there?   
 SANDRA GAL: No, I don't feel we lost the match. It was just a good game, good golf. And that's the result and we'll take it.
