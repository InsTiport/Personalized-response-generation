 Q.  I know you must be disappointed after that result today.  Can you sum up how you're feeling right now?  
SANDRA GAL: You know, I think it's just sports.  You win and you lose.  And I think we had an amazing week.  And we all enjoyed each others company.  We enjoyed some really, really good golf and some incredible crowds.  I'm not going to be too sad about it.   
They deserved it.  They played really well this afternoon and they made the putts.  I'm not going to cry and I'm sure we'll still call it a good week.   
 Q.  How did you feel about your round today?  
SANDRA GAL: I played solid, I just didn't make any putts.  Paula made some really long putts, and that's nice.  That's how it is.  I made tons of putts Friday and Saturday and maybe they just ran out.   
 Q.  How was the feeling in the team room this morning after the controversy on the 17th?  
SANDRA GAL: Yeah, we were all really down.  I don't think that controversy really helped our momentum at that moment, even though we were up in points.  But that's just how it is, a decision was made.   
Yeah, it's just a pity that there's always something like that that happens in the Solheim Cup.  But I think when you have a lot of -- two big teams, something is bound to happen that causes some kind of controversy.  It is what it is.   
 Q.  Do you feel that not going in the U.S. favor fired them up more?  
SANDRA GAL: I suppose it did, yeah.  It looks like it.  They may have just played better golf.
