  Q. Great round today.  The front nine you had an eagle.  What was that experience like?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   It was nice.  I thought the chip was running a little bit more.  I was like, oh, no.  But then it just -- it stopped and it was kind of heading to the hole and it went in, so it was kind of nice.
 Q. And the back nine you had so many birdies.  Is the back nine, does it play a little easier in general?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I don't know.  I just feel like I was playing every shot the same as my fellow like groupmates.  I don't know.  Just felt good.  I was hitting good shots and I saw some putts coming, thank God, so it was nice.
 Q. What would say was the best part of your game today?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I think a little bit of everything.  I kind of did a little bit of everything good.  Some of the mistakes a little bit of everything, too.
 Q. Yeah.  What was your thought coming into this tournament this week?  You knew it was three rounds.  How did that affect you physically, mentally?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I don't know.  I always like to come to Arkansas.  I think it's a really peaceful and calm tournament.  Really good food, too.
 Q. Yes, yes.  Which of the foods have you...
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I been eating so much strawberries, and on Sunday I'm going to look like a strawberry.
 Q. And so is that your favorite fruit?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Yeah.
 The courses is really nice.  The place is so calm and nice to come always.  So, I don't know, I enjoy this week.
 Q. Two more questions.  It's been really peaceful and calm so far.  There might be heavy rain tomorrow and definitely maybe Sunday.  How does that affect your mental part?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Well, we come from the British Open right now.  We come from a lot of wind and rain.  Anything is possible in this golf environment.
 Q. Yeah.
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   So just have to be in the moment and just everybody is playing in the same condition, so try to make the most out of it.
 Q. Final question:  What are you going to do tonight to relax to get ready for tomorrow?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Well, I'm going to do -- practice a little bit of everything, and then have a nice meal and start watching TV shows.
 Q. Which TV shows?
 MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I'm really watching White Collar.
 Q. Oh, the...
