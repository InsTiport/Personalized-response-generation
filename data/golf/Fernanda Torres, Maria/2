Q. Nice solid round out there on moving day.  How comfortable were you feeling at Highland Meadows?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I don't know, I feel really good, comfortable out there on the course.  I'm just trying to get the rhythm, and the pace of play was amazing.  It was fast and let's get it going.
So I'm happy.  But we have one more round, so...
Q. Were there any changes that you made between the last couple days to now, or just more of a consistent pace for you?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Yeah, I had more rhythm in my playing, and also I changed my driver and woods back to the old ones.  So I'm kind of happy -- I'm super happy with the change.
I don't know.  Just trying to keep the rhythm.  I'm finding the rhythm after so many -- like a lot of time practicing and not playing like tournaments, so now I'm trying to find rhythm.
Q. I was going to say, a lot of changes between Inverness and here.  Totally different course I feel like.  Did you have to change mentally coming into this week?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I don't know.  We have played this; this is my third year playing here.  I don't know.  Just trying to figure out the strategy of playing it, and I just think it was more the rhythm of me playing.
And also the changing my woods to the old ones.  It was like the best decision I could ever have possibly made.
Q. Really?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Yes.  No, really.
Q. What made you want to change it?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I had really a lot of trouble from tee shots on Inverness, and here I still can miss a fairway.
But, like, I don't know, I still couldn't find my draw.  I was opening -- I was blocking all my shots.  Now it's -- I'm kind of happy.
Q. Feeling a lot better?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   Yes.
Q. So what is it like now with our second event under way?  Nice moving day round for you?  What is there to continue working one?
MARIA FERNANDA TORRES:   I just want to keep the rhythm.  I really loved it.  Just go out there and play, and then we will see.
