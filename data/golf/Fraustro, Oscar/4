 Q.   How do you feel about the delay?  
OSCAR FRAUSTRO:   It's okay.   I haven't started.   I'm the last one to tee off on No. 1, so I still got another hour on top of the delay.  
You know, this happens not all the time, but it happened a lot on the Web.com Tour this year.   Nothing new.   Can't do anything about it.   Just be patient and enjoy a little time with the family.  
   
 Q.   You usually play on the Web.com Tour; you played PGA TOUR Latino America.   Ow you with the big boys on the PGA TOUR.   What's that feeling like?   
OSCAR FRAUSTRO:   Well, it's awesome.   It's where I want to be.   It's why we play, to play on the PGA TOUR.   It's very exciting.   
This is my second year playing in Mayakoba.   Last year was a little bit more ‑‑ last time; I shouldn't say last year ‑‑ was a little bit more nerve wracking because it was now my only chance.   
This time I have a card on the Web.com Tour, so this is just an event on my calendar.  
I'm very excited and can't wait to start.  
   
 Q.   What are your predictions about the course?   It's been raining.   Nervous about it?  
OSCAR FRAUSTRO:   No.   I mean, the course, you know, it depends so much on the conditions, on the wind.   You know, if it's wet like this and the wind doesn't blow much, you can be very aggressive, especially if you put on the ball in the fairway.  
But we have to just wait and see.   It's going to be playing very long because of the wetness, and that's it.
