JAY TEWELL:  It's been a good week so far.  I'm ready to go into match play.  It's going to be fun.  I've got dad on the bag, so we're excited about that.  He's trying to keep my head on my shoulders and keep me in line when I make mistakes.

JAY TEWELL:  Oh, I'd say, right now he's about an 8.  He's got a little room for improvement, but he's doing a great job.

DOUG TEWELL:  I did.  I carried them all 36.  They kept asking me if I wanted a cart, and I said no way.

JAY TEWELL:  Oh, he can make it, no problem.

JAY TEWELL:  I'm definitely a more of a right to left player, and we hit a lot of fairways, both of us.  And I think I make a lot of putts and get up-and-down a lot.  We're working on my consistency.  And just trying to hit a lot of fairways and greens this week.

JAY TEWELL:  There's a whole lot of conversation.  Sometimes he has to jump on my case, and say come on, stay in there, stay focused you have a long way to go.  We talk a lot.

DOUG TEWELL:  I think it follows you the whole time you're out there.  I'm pulling as hard as I can for Jay.  The main reason I'm out there is to help him develop his golf game.  He wants to play the PGA Tour for a living some day.  If I can give him some mental keys that he and I know it's a mental game when you get up into this level.  I just try to help him think better.

JAY TEWELL:  Thank you very much.
