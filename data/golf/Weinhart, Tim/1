  Q. Finished with a birdie on 18. How does that feel to cap off your week like that?  
 TIM WEINHART: It was just a little justice. Same thing I did yesterday. Real lucky start. Bogeyed the first four or five. Played almost identical. Just gotta get -- I don't know if it's more comfortable or get into a little bit more of an attacking mode.   
  
  Q. This is obviously a little different than your day-to-day teaching. What does it mean to be able to play in a tournament like this with all the eyes of the golf world on you?  
 TIM WEINHART: Well, you know, I've done this five times now. It's not just -- I don't want to just show up and be, oh, the club pro is playing. I want to contend. I want to play and make the cut.   
 I want to make some noise on the weekend, see what I can do about winning a golf tournament. That's what it's about. I understand there's other players that are pretty good. It's still just a golf tournament. That's the goal when I came down.   
  
  Q. Obviously looking forward --  
 TIM WEINHART: How does it compare to the rest of it? It's obviously a lot different. But I'll go back and start teaching again on Wednesday.  
  
  Q. A week of fun then?  
 TIM WEINHART: Well --  
  
  Q. As far as golfing goes?  
 TIM WEINHART: Yeah, it's pretty good.
