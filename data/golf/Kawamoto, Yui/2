 Q. How would you grade your play today?
 YUI KAWAMOTO:   I'm really satisfied with my golf this week.  I think I was able to do the best I can, and I'm just thankful that I'm able to play.
 Q. What was it like playing in the weather today?  How did that affect your round?
 YUI KAWAMOTO:   It was like a practice round for Scotland.
 Q. We heard your caddie say that it did feel like a nice Scottish day out there.  Did you like playing in the rain, or would you rather the sun be out like this today?
 YUI KAWAMOTO:   Yeah, definitely the rain was a good experience for me that helps me improve my game, but obviously I like the weather, the sunny weather.
 Q. How much confidence does that play this week give you going into next week?
 YUI KAWAMOTO:   Yes, definitely it gave me confidence, especially on a course like this, a tough course like this.  It's going to help my game a lot.  I'll be playing a lot more, so I'm very happy what I did this week.
