 Q.  Sam, how is that to start with the six birdies and a nice decent score?  
SAM BRAZEL: It was a great, sort of a flow on from last week.  Sort of found a bit of confidence and it's nice to play well.   
 Q.  And a good kind of score around Fanling?  
SAM BRAZEL: Yeah, look, I think I like the layout.  It's a bit old school sort of layout, so I really like that.   
 Q.  And you really do feel the confidence from last week, you say?  
SAM BRAZEL: Yeah, it's been good.  It's been sort of building, so it's nice.   
 Q.  How has it built?  How have you felt the game is coming together?  
SAM BRAZEL: I've got some new equipment a month ago, some new irons, and really starting to find my groove with them I guess.  It's nice.   
 Q.  I'm sure you're positive any week, but is it all the more positive coming into here with a course that you must know particularly well?  
SAM BRAZEL: Yeah, last week was really good, and obviously the new irons are building a little bit of confidence, as well.  I played well here last year, as well, so it was nice.   
 Q.  What is it that you have to do well around Fanling?  
SAM BRAZEL: I think you've got to hit a lot of greens.  I think if you start missing greens, you're in big trouble around here.
