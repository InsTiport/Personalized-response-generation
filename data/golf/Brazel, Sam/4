 Q.  Sam, what are your thoughts on a good knock on day two?  
SAM BRAZEL: It was fun out there again.  Got lucky a couple of times.  The putter seems to be working okay, so it's nice.   
 Q.  At the last got yourself out of some trouble.  
SAM BRAZEL: It's always nice to make a save when it's not really on the cards, but it was a good way to finish.  Especially coming off bogey off 9, that was a big one to make.   
 Q.  How big was it having the eagle early on in the round?  
SAM BRAZEL: Yeah, it was kind of unexpected, but always fun to make an eagle.  It was good.   
 Q.  Talk us through it.  It did sort of set up momentum for the day.  
SAM BRAZEL: Yeah, it did.  Hit a nice drive down there.  Got it just past the trap and then had a nice 4-iron in there to about six-foot and made the putt.  It was really good.   
 Q.  I appreciate it's only the second day and you're the first group out in the afternoon but are you aware of how you're pulling clear and there's a head-to-head between you and Rafa Cabrera-Bello?  
SAM BRAZEL: I was trying to play one shot at a time and control what I can control I guess.   
 Q.  It's the old mantra, but it pays off, doesn't it.  You have to have that attitude, really.  
SAM BRAZEL: It does, but it's kind of fun out there at the moment, so keep it going.   
 Q.  So into the weekend, confident?  
SAM BRAZEL: Just go and do my thing.  I'll just try and control what I can control once again.  Things are working well.
