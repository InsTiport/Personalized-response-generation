   THE MODERATOR: Thanks for coming in and joining us today. Great round out there. You finished at 5 under par, 67. And you're currently tied for second. Can you just talk about the round you played out there in those conditions and shooting a low score? 
 NA ON MIN: It's really cold in the morning, but it's getting warm. So it was okay. But I had no bogey today. That's what I'm really happy about. So my swing was good. But it's like the season, my swing wasn't really good. But it's getting better. It's getting better like in the last two weeks and I think my swing and putting, I think it's coming.
 THE MODERATOR: Can we go over your scorecard? Can you tell me what your approach shot was and how close to the pin you were on 15, your birdie, the par 3? What club did you use? I was going through your birdies. 
 NA ON MIN: Is it one that I made birdie? 
 THE MODERATOR: Yes. 
 NA ON MIN: The putt was really far like 30 feet.
 THE MODERATOR: What club did you use? 
 NA ON MIN: 8-iron.
 THE MODERATOR: How about 7th? 
 NA ON MIN: 58 degrees, it almost seemed --
 THE MODERATOR: Inches? Okay. How about the birdie on 2? 
 NA ON MIN: Yeah, two tries. Reached 2 in two putts.
 THE MODERATOR: From how far? 
 NA ON MIN: Like 15 feet. 
 THE MODERATOR: How about the birdie on 4? 
 NA ON MIN: Par 5, too. It's like 13 feet for eagle putt.
 THE MODERATOR: What club? 
 NA ON MIN: 5-wood.
 THE MODERATOR: And birdie on 5? 
 NA ON MIN: That I used pitching wedge. It was like seven feet.
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Na Min.

 Q. Are you comfortable playing in the cold weather? Do you feel that you're more effective in cold weather than if it were 80 degrees and humid? 
 NA ON MIN: No, I actually don't like this weather, the cold. I have three pants on, like four in the top. But it was okay. But, yeah, I think it wasn't windy too much. So it was better.

 Q. Was there any aspect of your game that was working well for you today? 
 NA ON MIN: Definitely my driver, it wasn't -- like I really didn't feel comfortable with my driver. But I think it's getting better. So I really like that.

 Q. With all the bad weather we've had in the last couple of days, did that help you prepare for today's round?
 NA ON MIN: Well, yeah, I think so. The course condition is really -- I think it's different than last year. So it's more soft. And so I think so.

 Q. Did you play at Corning before? 
 NA ON MIN: Yeah, last year.

 Q. How did you do? 
 NA ON MIN: I finished maybe like 20 something. 

 Q. So having played the course before, were you a little more comfortable, knew the settings and all?
 NA ON MIN: Yeah, it is. Last year was my rookie year. So I didn't know the course, but right now it's my second year, it's really helped me.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
