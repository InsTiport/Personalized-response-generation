 Q.  What was the difference? 
 NA ON MIN:  I just thought too much in my head when I'm putting.  Just want to forget about it and focus on the hole and my ball. 

 Q.  The four straight birdies, did that make you feel proud? 
 NA ON MIN:  When I get like 16, my last birdie, I didn't know -- just focus. 

 Q.  You were focused? 
 NA ON MIN:  I didn't know it was four birdies. 

 Q.  What were your thoughts of Suzann? 
 NA ON MIN:  Suzann is really great player.  She hits long and she just keeps trying to play. 

 Q.  What did you learn this week? 
 NA ON MIN:  English. 

 Q.  About yourself or about your game? 
 NA ON MIN:  I came here just last year for the tournament.  I practice in my country and here. 

 Q.  Does it prove that you can compete and contend out here, that you can play with the very best players stroke for stroke; you came within a few strokes of winning.  Do you feel more confident? 
 NA ON MIN:  Yeah, I just -- yeah.  Just feel comfortable and my putting first and second day was not uncomfortable, but third round I found my stroke.  So I just tried to keep that faith -- and I just missed front nine but I find again on the back nine. 

 Q.  The tears, is that just disappointment? 
 NA ON MIN:  Just they ask about my father. 

 Q.  What did they ask? 
 NA ON MIN:  "Say something to your father."  

 Q.  Is it just because he's invested so much in your career? 
 NA ON MIN:  Yeah, for me, he's done everything. 

 Q.  Before you go, could you do your four birdies in a row? 
 NA ON MIN:  No. 13, 8-iron about six feet and made the putt. 
 14, I hit a gap wedge about 15 feet, 18 feet and made the putt. 
 No. 15 was about 12-foot, made it. 
 Then 16 was a 6-footer.  Gap wedge into 16.  And 15 was just a half of a pitching wedge.
