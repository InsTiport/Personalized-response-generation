JERRY COURVILLE:  Roger birdied the first hole and he made about a 20-footer.  So I was one down there.  Then I hit it -- on 3 I hit it about four feet, made birdie there.  And 4 I made about a 12-footer for birdie.  Then I bogeyed 5 again, hit it over the green.  And then 6 I hit a sand wedge in there about a foot and made birdie there.  7 I hit a little 9-iron in about 6 feet, which he gave me for birdie.  And then on 8 I hit had about a 12 footer, and Roger hit it in the back of the green and 3-putted it down the hill.  And I 2-putted it.  And then -- actually 11 Roger makes about a 25 footer for birdie to tie me on the hole for 11.  And then 12 I hit it left, made bogey there.  I missed about a 4-footer or 5-footer.  13 I 3-putted from the front part of the green.  14 I made birdie, I hit it right in front of 2, chipped it up 3 about 5 feet.  Roger hit up on the green.  15 I hit it over the green and got it up-and-down.  And 16 I got it up-and-down from the bunker.  And Roger hit it in about 12 feet and it just didn't break for him.


Q.  So you're 6 under par for the round?

JERRY COURVILLE:  No, I made a couple of bogeys out there.  Probably 3-under, maybe.


Q.  You had 6 birdies, though.

JERRY COURVILLE:  I don't know.  One of those I went with a par.  But we tied a hole -- I think I made 5 birdies.


Q.  Played well, though?

JERRY COURVILLE:  For me, yeah, I played well.


Q.  What is your job?  Give me a little bit of your background?

JERRY COURVILLE:  What do I do for a living?


Q.  Yes.

JERRY COURVILLE:  I work at Pitney-Bowes in the rapid prototype center where we make all the prototype machines, I'm a coordinator there.


Q.  Is that in Milford?

JERRY COURVILLE:  That's actually in Shelton.


Q.  Jerry, you played obviously a lot of guys and you're not going to be intimidated, but what is it about Tiger's game that could be intimidating to a less experienced player?

JERRY COURVILLE:  I think the way he hits it and just the way he manager his way around a golf course.  He makes very few mistakes.  To beat him you've got to play almost a perfect round.  He doesn't have too many off days.


Q.  How many times have you played him in match play?

JERRY COURVILLE:  None yet.


Q.  How do you feel about your chances?

JERRY COURVILLE:  Well, I'm even with him right now.  Seriously, I'm going to go out and play as hard as I can and see what happens.


Q.  Is it a fun thing for you to get to play him?

JERRY COURVILLE:  Oh, yeah.  You look at it and your goal is to make the cut and then you make the cut and try to win a match or so and then you win one.  If you're going to lose a match and you lose it to a guy like that -- actually I have nothing to lose tomorrow.  Who expects  me to win?


Q.  How many times have you been Walker Cup?

JERRY COURVILLE:  One.


Q.  Jerry, this will be the first time you've played him?

JERRY COURVILLE:  Played against him, yes, head to head.


Q.  You guy have played together or spent time together?

JERRY COURVILLE:  Over in Wales we did; down in Augusta this year.  I offered to take him out to dinner tonight but he wouldn't go (laughter.)

JERRY COURVILLE:  I'm not going to say I've played guys as good as him, but I've played a lot of real good players.  I realize how good he is, and I know what he's going to be doing out there.  I can't worry about what he's doing.  I've got to go out and play my game.


Q.  How old are you, Jerry?

JERRY COURVILLE:  37.

JERRY COURVILLE:  This is my 9th one and I made it to the semifinals in '89.
