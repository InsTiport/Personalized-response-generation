 Q.  How does it feel to be at the top of the leaderboard?  
JENNY SHIN: Feels pretty good.  Haven't been in contention for a while, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  And I am happy to be at the top.   
 Q.  Was there anything that was different, that felt different for you today?  
JENNY SHIN: If anything, I was a little bit more distracted than yesterday.  Needless to say, I could have gone a little bit lower.  I could have made a few putts.   
I had a brain fart on No. 10 and I was only 35 yards away and barely par'd, so just stuff like that.   
Yeah, I was a little bit more distracted.   
 Q.  It was because of the heat?  
JENNY SHIN: I think it could be.  I wasn't hydrated enough this morning and I was kind of feeling it creeping in mid-afternoon.   
So I started drinking lots of water, but might have been a little bit too late.   
 Q.  You still managed to pull off a really great round.  
JENNY SHIN: Yeah, thank you.   
 Q.  Especially the birdie on 18.  
JENNY SHIN: Yeah, that was a great birdie putt, left to right, downhill, and I hit it pretty aggressively, so that felt really good.   
 Q.  What are you going to do to make sure that you maintain that mental kind of drive into tomorrow and the rest of the tournament?  
JENNY SHIN: Probably get some rest, hydrate, and fuel up a little bit.  I think the next two days is more my physical ability than my mental ability.  I'll focus on that a little bit more.
