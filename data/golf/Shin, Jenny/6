Q: Excited to be back on the Asia Swing?
JENNY SHIN: Yes, I am. Itâs great to come back to China. We lost that tournament in Beijing, so happy to be in Shanghai this year.
Q: Have you had a chance to explore Shanghai at all?
JENNY SHIN: A little bit. Thereâs a small city outside the hotel, so Iâve been taking taxis and just roaming around with a few friends and eating Chinese food.
Q: Whatâs your take on the course?
JENNY SHIN: Itâs kind of similar to courses in Orlando, believe it or not. Iâm pretty used to Bermuda grass and the fairways are pretty wide. It should be a pretty fun course.
