 Q.  Very nice to have those five consecutive birdies on the front nine.  Bet you didn't want that to stop.  
JENNY SHIN: Yeah, it was a great start.  Hit a shot pretty close, and then that was it.  I rolled a few putts here and there, and that got me going.   
Finished all the way until 8 and bogeyed No. 9.   
 Q.  But you got some back on the back nine; it's a very good score.  When you're facing some the downhill putts you have on this golf course, what do you do?  How do you face those downhill very slick putts?  
JENNY SHIN: Thankfully I've been practicing at my home course and the greens are very, very slick there.  This is any eighth year out here and I know how fast it gets.  I kind of got used to it and I've been practicing for that, so it wasn't too difficult.   
 Q.  Now, a lot of people are suffering in this heat.  It is hot out here, but you were quite enjoying it.  
JENNY SHIN: Yeah.  It was snowing in Vegas, and it still is snowing.  The highest it was getting to maybe 32 degrees, I was like, I can't wait to get to the Thailand, I can't wait to sweat.  I haven't sweat in a long time unless I hit the gym, so this is quite nice for me.
