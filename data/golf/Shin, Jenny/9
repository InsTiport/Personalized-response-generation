Q. I think maybe not quite the round you were looking for today but still in contention.  Anything can happen.  How do you feel right now?
JENNY SHIN: Well, it started off a really, really bad day I think.  I accidentally left my putter in the hotel room, so I had a really hectic morning.  Thank God it wasn't the old hotel, because if it was, I wouldn't have played the first two holes without my putter.
Just a lot of things happened.  Physically I'm not feeling that well.  So just nothing went right.  Had a few hiccups on the front nine, misjudging the wind and the club, and then it was just continuous of mistakes.  Like it was really frustrating today.
Q. Just one of those days on the golf course.  But I think just as often as you have one of those days, you could have a really good day.  You've seen it.  There's good stuff out there.
JENNY SHIN: Yeah, maybe I play well in the rain, and I hope it just comes down tomorrow and maybe I'll play 7-under par, you never know.
Yeah, like you said, everybody has a bad day.  Everybody has a good day.  That was my bad day.  So hopefully tomorrow I can come back with a solid round and hopefully try to catch the leader.  I know there's a big gap, but I've known Eun-Hee for a really long time, and playing with her two days in a row, it's going to be an interesting day tomorrow.
Q. Back to the putter.  Did you have to go back to the hotel and get it?
JENNY SHIN: I had a really good friend who was willing to go back.  So he went back for me.  Thank you, Shane, I love you.
Q. It happens, right.
JENNY SHIN: I know.  First time, but there's a first time for everything.  I feel like I'm doing that a lot.  But yeah, I got it, and I played the first hole with it.
