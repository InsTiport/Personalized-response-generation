 Q.  Did you feel a lot of nerves today?  
JENNY SHIN: No, it was same as any other days.  It was tough finishing up a few holes because I struggled with 17, 18, throughout the whole week.  17 I kept hitting it right all week.  So when I hit that shot on 17 today, I wasn't actually surprised.  I was just a little bit more disappointed.   
18, bogeyed there again yesterday.  I don't know, probably today, the nerves got me maybe.  Not sure if I would have made that mistake on many other holes.  Oh, well.   
 Q.  Were the bogeys from the days before in your head?  
JENNY SHIN: Well, I putted well these last few days, and I relied on that today, as well.  That putt on 16 really got me going.  I was pretty confident.  I wasn't nervous at all.  But yeah, it was good.   
 Q.  Is there anything you'll take from this for next time?  
JENNY SHIN: I think I've done a great job today.  The nerves didn't get me at all.  The nerves that I got on 18, I think any human being would experience it.   
So I handled it very calmly.  I wasn't rushing.  I wasn't -- I wasn't too nervous.  It's just the adrenaline, really.  So if I had this opportunity again this year, I'd probably handle it the same exact way.   
 Q.  Can you talk a bit about the yardage, the approach shot?  What were you playing to, and the chip, as well.  
JENNY SHIN: I don't know the exact yardage to the pin but I know where I wanted to land it was 12 yards.  Obviously missed that by like five yards.  But I got a little bit too wristy there.  Yeah, just got to do better next time.   
 Q.  The chip, how far were you and were you aiming for a certain spot or did you just miss that spot?  
JENNY SHIN: Yeah, I was definitely aiming for that uphill, on the right side, and I just was getting a little too wristy and I came up way short.
