Q.   Do you mind talking very quickly through your round?   You birdied the fifth?
JENNY SHIN:   I did.   It was a good putt.   That hole, the fifth hole, the tee shot, you need to hit straight and I did do that; and I wanted to keep it left of the hole and I did.   Made the putt.
Next hole, I hit in the bunker but hit a great shot out of the bunker, and then seventh, I chipped it to about 2 1/2 feet and made that for birdie. 
And then the eighth, I hit it too 15 feet and made that, as well.   It was a pretty easy putt straight up into the hill.

Q.   So putting was good today?
JENNY SHIN:   Yeah, putting was good today.   But it seems like I 3‑putt at least once a round out here.   I feel like my putting saved me and killed me at the same time.   It's been like that since Australia.   If I could just focus and not miss any 5‑footers, that would be great.   
On 18, I missed a 4‑footer birdie putt, and I missed the 2‑footer coming back.   Miss‑read all those putts.   I did that yesterday, miss‑read a lot of my 5‑footers.   It's tough with the grain, and the slope.   I've gotten used to it already but some of the holes, it's still a little bit confusing. 

Q.   You're in a great place, considering you've got this on your mind?
JENNY SHIN:   Right.   I feel like I shot 5‑over today but I still ended up with 2‑under par.   The double on the 15th killed me. 

Q.   But you're still left well‑placed for the weekend. 
JENNY SHIN:   Right, three strokes behind, two days left, so I'm not worried too much about it.   Just do what I did today ask yesterday, and focus a little bit more.
