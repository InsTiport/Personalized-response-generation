Q. Talk to me about how you felt today.
JENNY SHIN: I played better than I thought.  Overall, I missed quite a few five-footers out there.  Some of them were for par, some of them were for birdie.  I feel that I could have done a lot better, but it's the best driving accuracy I've had this season, so pretty happy about that.
Q. What do you think was the difference there?
JENNY SHIN: You know, I got a new coach last year, and I've been working on my swing.  It's just coming back together.  You know, that's really it.  Just my swing is coming back together, and I'm feeling a little bit more confident over the days.
Q. What's your coach's name?
JENNY SHIN: Robin Symes.
Q. Is it noticeable, the lack of wind, and then starting to pick up later in the afternoon?  Were you starting to feel it a little bit at the end?
JENNY SHIN: Not really.  I was surprised because when I saw the weather channel, it said gusts of 30 to 50, but I don't see that happening because it should have picked up at least 10 by now.  But it might be different tomorrow.
