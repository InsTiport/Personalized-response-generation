Q. So you guys survived.  That was a quite a battle you guys had out there this afternoon.  Tell me what happened?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: We did.
Q. What's with the laughs?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Our flight mates were really good.  Like they were really good, and going into this last hole, we didn't even expect to have it --
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Expect to win.
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: -- to have it because they were really good.  Like on the greens and through the fairways, then somehow we pulled through, thanks to Princess's last putt.
Q. That was quite a putt you had there.  What were you thinking as you stood over that putt?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: I just --
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I told her the line, so it's definitely my putt.
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: I told myself just to make that putt.
Q. Were you feeling any pressure?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: No, not really.
Q. You guys birdied 16, which is like one of the hardest holes out here.
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: She birdied it.
Q. It's one of the hardest holes on the course?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I know that par-3.
Q. What did you hit?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I hit a 19 Â° Rescue up the hill.  It was 198 yards.
Q. That's been kind of a pivotal hole in matches this week.  Has it been a hole that you guys have played well?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: The 16?  Yeah, I had a birdie on 16 also yesterday, so it's been pretty good to me throughout this week.
Q. But it's been very difficult for most people.  What is it about the hole that you like about it that seems to fit your eye?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I used a Rescue today and a 3-wood yesterday, and my woods were pretty good this week, so I was confident with that hole.
Q. What about your thoughts of going for another National Championship?  You won one as an individual, and now you have a chance to win one with a partner.  What are your thoughts about that?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: I don't know.  Well, I'll do my best tomorrow, and a little -- not a little -- I need help from her too.
Q. You really rely on each other on the golf course?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Of course we do.
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes, yes.
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I think our style complements each other on the course because she's more of an accurate on the fairway hitter, but then she just hits the right yardages, but then I hit longer.  So she's the one on the greens and I'm the one on the fairway.  So we cover that.
Q. I see you're wearing kind of matching outfits.  Do you guys play at the same club?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: We do, at the country club.
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes.
Q. Is that in Manila?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes.
Q. Is that how you guys kind of formed this partnership?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Yeah, we see each other a lot.
Q. Both on the national team, right?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Uh-huh.
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Yeah.
Q. I was looking at your schedules.  You have traveled all over the place this year.  Do you usually travel together or how does that work?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: We usually travel as a team with our coach and our other teammates.
Q. That were here this week?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes.
Q. Sophia and Makayla?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes.
Q. They came out and caddied for you.  Is that a bit of a pick-up?  You haven't had caddies at all this week.
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Well, they had to do their job a while ago and yesterday.  So they just came out to watch the last few holes.
Q. Have you guys had a chance to do anything fun away from golf, either before or maybe playing afterwards?  You're in an area where there are a lot of fun things to do, Disney World and Busch Gardens.
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Aren't we going to a theme park in California?
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: California Adventures next week.  Yeah, I think we're going.
Q. Then you're flying back home?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: No, we're staying here for the summer.
Q. So where are you based out of in Southern Cal somewhere?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Sun City, Menifee.  It's like in between San Diego and L.A.  It's near Riverside.
Q. How are you dealing with this heat?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Same weather at Manila.
Q. That's true, that's true?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: It's not much of a change.
Q. But there wasn't any wind today?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: No, it was steamy.
PRINCESS MARY SUPERAL: Yes, steamy (laughing).
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Steamy weather.
Q. Is it safe to say this was your toughest match you've had so far?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Yes, they were incredibly accurate, and they were good on the greens as well.  Complementing Princess's short game.
Q. So what is your schedule like then for the rest of the summer?  What kind of events are you guys playing?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I'm playing junior tournaments since I'm still 17.
Q. So with like the U.S. Girls?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Uh-huh, and Junior World and all that.
Q. So you'll stay, and then go to college in the fall, or are you going to college next year?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: I might go to college in the fall.
Q. At Kansas?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: At Kansas.
Q. That's a little change of pace from Manila, isn't it?
PAULINE DEL ROSARIO: Yes.
