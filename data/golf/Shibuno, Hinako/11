Q. How does it feel to be back playing on the LPGA this week? What are you most looking forward to?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: To be able to play with the foreign players is the most fun part, and plus, to get in touch with the foreign players again is fun.
Q. What was the reaction like coming home to Japan after winning the British Open?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: It was nothing like I experienced before.
Q. How has your life changed since then?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I can't walk outside. Even people that don't know golf or don't know about golf notice me. I am enjoying it.
Q. What about your season on the golf course? You've had success on the LPGA and on the JLPGA. Can you talk about your year?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Very noisy, loud.
Q. Lots of fans screaming for you?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Yes.
Q. And what are your goals here this week?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: To make the Top-10.
Q. Have you given any thought to your LPGA membership for next year?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Yes, made a decision not to be on the U.S. LPGA. Stay in Japan.
Q. Can you give a bit of background as to why you came to that decision?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I don't think I have enough skills to play on the U.S. LPGA, and only my first year on the Japan Tour, so I think I need to play a few more years on the Japan Tour before going to the U.S.
Q. So it's something you might think about down the road?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Yes.
