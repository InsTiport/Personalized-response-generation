 Q.  What happened on final hole?  
HINAKO SHIBUNO: It was such poor putt. I three putted for bogey. Very bad stroke.   
 Q.  Playing with Lexi?  
HINAKO SHIBUNO: She over drove me like 20 to 30 yards from the beginning. And she finished with Eagle. The way she plays golf is like a star.   
 Q.  Had any chance to talk to Lexi today?  
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Not much. She was always ahead of me. Her tee-shot, iron sounded different. I donÂ’t know why so much distance difference.   
 Q.  For 2nd round?  
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I played well until the last hole today. So I will keep doing that and play under par round. I kept myself controlled making good pars. Made good downhill putts, too. Overall my putting was good. I just wanted to end better today. I have to score better tomorrow to keep ranking high. For 2 days at least 60th. I have to try harder.
