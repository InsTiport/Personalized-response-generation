  Q:   Shot 70, 2 under, good start with two birdies, how do you describe your round today?
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   I was very surprised with myself with two birdies and definitely this was the best round this year so far. But when I bogeyed on the third hole, that settled me down a little bit. (laugh) From there, I was able to keep my momentum until finish and I am am very happy with the way I played today.
 Q:   You made a lot of good putts, par-5s and many up and down as well. Noticed you changed for the left hand low putting. When did you start working with it and how did you like it here?
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   Actually after I missed the cut at AIG, I spent some time practicing over the weekend there. I just felt my putting stroke was not really working especially on the fast greens. So I asked my coach if I should change it to a left hand low grip and he said thats really good idea. So I practiced it the last couple of weeks in Los Angeles before I came here. This was the first time to try it at a tournament and it really worked out for the green speed and I had no three putts, which really helped too.
 Q:   Were you nervous or did feel any pressure at all ?
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   Yes, I was pretty nervous on the first tee, but after I hit the fairway with my tee shot, my second was perfect and then I made it, I was fine. Its been a while since I made three good shots in a row. This made me  confident out there.
 Q:   What do you expect for tomorrow?
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   The forecast said over 100F for tomorrow, so it will be very tough in the afternoon, I will make sure to be hydrated and try to keep my energy going for 18 holes. I will try not to waste todays round.
