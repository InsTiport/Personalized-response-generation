  Q. A major winner.  Now you've put yourself in contention again.  Where do you feel like you can go from here?  A lot of good to take out of this week.
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   I feel that this is my true performance.  I have frustration, as well; however, I do not have any regret.
 Q. Talk about the play today and the conditions out there and kind of how it went for you.
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   Today I hit the least greens in regulation out of the four days.  Even though today was the least greens in regulation, about half of them I was able to make pars.
 I do have a little bit of confidence in my approaches; however, when it comes to shots, my shots weren't preferable under pressure.  So in that respect I learned a lot about myself.
 Q. How surprised were you that someone was able to go out and shoot 4-under today?
 HINAKO SHIBUNO:   During this weather being able to perform that well, those are the players that are the real quality golfers.  And those players that can get to 4-under, those players are the ones who are able to perform any time, so they are very strong players I think.
