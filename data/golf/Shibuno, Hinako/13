SARAH GWYNN: Well done on a fantastic round.  What was going through your mind when you reached the turn in 1-over par before you had that amazing back nine?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I was pretty upset after the three-putt bogey on the ninth, but after the second shot on the 10th hole, I was able to bring myself back.
SARAH GWYNN: And what is it about Woburn you're enjoying so much?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Whatever I imagine the British Open, it feels like a links course, but it wasn't.  It's more like a Japanese golf course, so maybe that may be how I got my Steph a little smoother into the tournament.
SARAH GWYNN: Your first time playing outside Japan.  You must be exceeding all expectations.
HINAKO SHIBUNO: It's definitely exceeding my expectations.  Came in wanting to make the cut, so right now I feel like I'm doing something very incredible.
Q. Had you been outside of Japan just for travel, just for fun, prior to this, and where?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Maybe for a little bit, the last year in Thailand just to train, but other than that, not really, or none.
Q. You won a major in Japan earlier this year.  Can you talk about how this compares to that?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: The nervousness, I can't really compare the two.
Q. Is this more?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Yes.
Q. Which of the international players did you want to watch and which of them in this field do you really admire?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Lex-because she's a long hitter.
Q. What surprises you about England?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I went to London for sightseeing before the tournament, and there were many people performing outside.
Q. Can you add some details to how and why you got the nickname, Smiling Cinderella?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I think it's because I was smiling after my first win in Japan, and a few other nicknames were like Smiling Angel, as well.
Q. Your manager wears some quite colorful outfits.  Can you explain why he does that and what effect that has on your mood?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Difficult to comment but a little embarrassing.
Q. Do you notice him when you're on the course?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: No.
Q. But he does make you smile --
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Crazy.  (Laughter).
Q. You've had quite the rise this year.  Can you talk about how your game has improved this year to get to where you are today?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Last year, I passed the professional golfer's test in Japan, and at that point, I didn't even know if I could play on Tour.  So I really can't understand why I'm performing at this level, but I think my coach is really helping me.
Q. Can you explain what the professional golfer's test is?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: It's just a four-day tournament in Japan, but it makes you want to vomit and (laughter) I never want to go through it again.
Q. Wow, is it harder than this?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: No, not really.
Q. Do the other Japanese managers dress up for a round, or is it just your manager?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Just my manager.  (Laughter).
Q. And you have never said, "Why do you dress up?" ?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: No.
Q. What's your earliest memory of watching an LPGA major championship?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Maybe when I was in middle school or high school.
Q. Do you remember who won or what was specifically interesting?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I remember Ai Miyazato contending, as well as when Yani was at her best.
Q. What impact do you think it would have on golf in the Olympics in Japan if you were to win tomorrow?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: I felt like this tournament would be important for me personally, for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo next year.  So if I can win tomorrow, maybe that gets me closer to being able to play in the event.
Q. Could I ask, what have you been doing in the evenings, and what will you be doing this evening and who will you be spending time with?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: So after a round, I eat, take a shower, I eat some sweets, watch YouTube and sleep.
Q. Do you have any hobbies away from golf?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Softball.
Q. Do you cook or are you an artist at all?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Not good at both cooking or art.
Q. How does your double-jointedness affect your golf game?
HINAKO SHIBUNO: Not sure how much of an effect it has.  This may be impedes my game sometimes, or wonder if it will ever impede.
SARAH GWYNN: Thank you.
