 Q.  Bogey-free round; five birdies.  
MARIAJO URIBE: Yeah.   
 Q.  What was working well for you today?  
MARIAJO URIBE: I mean, just putting.  I made the putts I had to make; when I missed the greens I saved the pars.   
So just like really steady round.  Compared to the last few weeks I just made more putts.  Tried to be a little more aggressive with my putting and it worked today.  Looking forward for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Is that something you've been working on, just staying aggressive?  
MARIAJO URIBE: Yeah.  I mean, last week I play with Morgan the first two rounds and she was leading.  She putted so firm and they were going in, so that's something I used to do when I was an amateur.  You just get onto tour and you just fall into bad habits.  Working on it again.   
This week, I mean, it worked today, so hopefully for tomorrow I have a good round and looking good for the weekend.   
 Q.  What do you like about this course?  
MARIAJO URIBE: It's weird.  It's like love-hate relationship.  Two years ago I finished really good, top 10; last year I didn't make the cut.   
So just one of those weeks you just have to be hitting your driver good and putting yourself in good position from to the tee.   
I just like Portland.  The weather is awesome and the food is great.  When you feel good I think you play good.  It's just a tournament that I like in general, so hopefully I have a good week.   
 Q.  Saw your I think Instagram.  You've been going to some really cool places.  
MARIAJO URIBE: Yeah, the restaurants are unbelievable.  A lot of sushi bars.  We went to ramen noodle the other day; yesterday we went to Mexican.  There are so many food trucks.  Just such an amazing week.  I'm excited.   
And my husband is here, so it's nice to have something to just go after the round and just chill and get your head away from golf.
