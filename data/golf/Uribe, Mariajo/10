 Q.  18, what happened?  
MARIAJO URIBE: I missed my driver a little bit left and I was on the first cut, a little weird lie, but I hit the 3-wood and see what happened.  Hit it, I had like a 35-yard shot, and it landed like five yards short and it just went in on the second bounce, an eagle.  It's a pretty nice way to finish.   
I birdied 17, too, so 3-under on the last two holes helped me move up the leaderboard and in a good position for tomorrow.   
 Q.  And the overall round?  
MARIAJO URIBE: I've played solid all week.  Just haven't made really that many putts.  Today I holed on that hole and a bunker shot, so that really helped out.  But other than that, a lot of short misses, like birdie putts.  I mean, I'm playing good. I'm just going to go practice a little bit my drive that wasn't great on the last holes, but I feel good.  I love this tournament, so we'll see what happens.
