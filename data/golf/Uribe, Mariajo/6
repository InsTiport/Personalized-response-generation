 Q.  Obviously not the finish you wanted, but you played really well.  You have to feel pretty positive at the end of the day, don't you?  
MARIAJO URIBE: Yeah, I mean, the whole week I didn't hit the ball great and it just couldn't (indiscernible) the last couple holes.   
I feel positive going to the next week, and hopefully I'll be in the same position soon.
