  Q. I'm here with Maria Jose Uribe, who finishes as low amateur. Only 18 years old.   
2-under par, you join Grace Park as the only two players to ever finish as amateurs under par at the Women's Open, that's terrific.   
 MARIA JOSE URIBE: That's a great honor to be at the side of Grace Park, a great player, too, and a confidence boost for my game.  
  
  Q. You opted to not defend at the Women's Amateur, which you won last year, and you'll next go to --  
 MARIA JOSE URIBE: The British Open, it's good experience. And it's going to be good for my game. I'm looking forward to it.  
  
  Q. That was an exciting week. Congratulations, you've got a gold medal to go pick up.   
 MARIA JOSE URIBE: Thank you.
