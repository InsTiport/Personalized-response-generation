Q.   Okay.   We're here with Mariajo Uribe, the co‑leader, 5‑under, co‑leader with Paula Creamer here at the Kia Classic.   This was your low round of the year so far.   What was working for you today?   Can you take us through your round a little bit?
MARIAJO URIBE:   Yeah, I mean just the first‑‑ I took advantage of the first couple of holes where the greens weren't that bad.   Made four birdies on the first five holes and just took it from there, stayed pretty calm. 
We were playing pretty slow out there, so just a lot of time down, and didn't really think about it that much.   I just wanted to be done today and don't have to come in the morning.

Q.   Now, you brought it up, the pace.   The pace was a little bit slow for the back nine.   Can you talk about that?   Did it affect your game at all?
MARIAJO URIBE:   I mean it's just a rush at the end.   You don't want to come at five am to warm up and play one hole.   But I mean we were trying to do as fast as we could, and we were always waiting.   But I just tried to stay calm, and it had affected me past and I'm glad it didn't today.

Q.   How did you overcome that this time around?
MARIAJO URIBE:   Yeah, it was a fun group.   We get along well with the players I was playing with, so at least we were waiting with people that we like to talk to and it went by faster than other times.

Q.   And how was it with the darkness coming?   I know you had to pick it up there at the end, but could you see it on the 18th hole?
MARIAJO URIBE:   Not really.   I mean on the Green I'm glad we had those shadowed greens on the book, because it was really hard to see if it was uphill or downhill.   I just wanted to make a par and get out of here.

Q.   Okay.   Thank you.   Congratulations. 
MARIAJO URIBE:
