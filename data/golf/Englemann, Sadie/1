Q. It didn't end the way you wanted it to, but you fought back from 2-down and made a great comeback to get it to extra holes.  Just talk about the match as a whole.  You knew it was going to be a tough match obviously.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: Yeah, I felt like on the first 13 holes we played good golf.  They just kind of made more putts than we did.
RACHEL HECK: Yeah, uh-huh.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: But I think we turned it around pretty well on those two holes and got the momentum.
Just didn't happen to win a hole after that.
Q. I know on 13 I believe it was Jillian -- Casey made a long par putt to keep them 2-up.  That must have been a point, What, are they going to just keep making these?  We have a chance to chip away, but it's not happening.  Yet you kept at it.
RACHEL HECK: Uh-huh, yeah.  I mean, we played them in stroke play.  We knew they were great players.  They are really good at putting.  They made a ton of putts today.
I mean, every putt they had we were expecting it to go in.  That's what you got to do.
Q. That's the way you have to approach it, right?
RACHEL HECK: Uh-huh.
Q. You obviously had your run too; got it back to all square.  Talk about that battle, the back and forth the last few holes.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: Yeah, I think it was fun.  Like 16 through No. 1 were an absolute battle.  We kind of struggled on the last hole, but, yeah, we had a good run at it on 18.
Almost made birdie.  I made the long - long-ish - par putt to keep it going.
Q. Yeah.  And maybe a little early to say, but the week as a whole, you obviously had a fabulous week to get to this point.  Did you learn about yourselves a little bit maybe playing together and succeeding as you did?
RACHEL HECK: Yeah, it was a fun week.  I think most of it is looking forward to being teammates at Stanford in a couple years.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: Yeah.  And I think another thing - I can speak for both of us - we gained a lot of confidence in our own game, so when we do go back to playing individual golf we can think back to the shots we hit and the putts we made and be confident.
Q. You had some great wins and like you say, also excelled in stroke play and match play.  You've got to take a lot out of that.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: Yeah, for sure.
RACHEL HECK: Uh-huh.
Q. Well thank you so much for your time to both of you.
RACHEL HECK: Thank you.  Nice to meet you.
SADIE ENGLEMANN: Thank you.  Nice to meet you.
