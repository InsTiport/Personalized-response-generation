Q.   Was it important to stay below the hole?   Was that something you reminded yourself of? 
MINDY KIM:   Yeah, especially on the greens.   It was really fun today, even with the rain.   It's definitely faster if you're above the greens or above the pins.   You don't want to be long from any pin.   It was just being short of the pin, I think, is key here.

Q.   What of the coolness and the rain? 
MINDY KIM:   It's not ideal, but we'll take it because it's not pouring right now.   No wind is great.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
MINDY KIM:   Yeah, I could have‑‑ I guess, I had a clean round today.   I had a couple of hiccups, but I made my putts, and I think that's the reason why I shot 3‑under today.

Q.   Good finish, tied for second with Moira Dunn.   Just under Moira Dunn.   How does that feel heading into the second round? 
MINDY KIM:   It feels great.   I haven't been in this position for a while now.   I've been struggling all year.   It's a good start.   There.
Is nothing really I can ask.   Yeah, I guess that's it.

Q.   With the weather today being hot and sunny and then rainy and cool, do you feel like that affected the course and your game at all? 
MINDY KIM:   Not really.   But I mean the greens softened up a lot because there was a shower, a couple of showers when we were playing.   So that was a help for us.
