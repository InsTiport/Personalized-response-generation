 Q.  Lexi, 7-under par today, 12-under par through the first two rounds.  How would you assess your first two rounds here?  Knowledge?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Thanks.  Yeah, very well so far.  Over all just having fun on the golf course, staying very relaxed, and focusing on doing my routine.  I played some great golf, so hopefully continue into the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you think this golf course plays to your strengths?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, kind of.  I mean, I don't hit to many drivers; it's more hybrids, 3-woods.  But if you hit it on the green - and the greens are rolling so well.  It's a ball-striking golf course, but all depends on the wind if it picks up.   
 Q.  You were off last week.  When you are off do you get that competitive itch?  Are you anxious to get back out and playing tournaments once again?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I definitely do.  More towards the end of the week off I do.  I always enjoy my time off.  Get to spend time with my family and train a good bit and get ready for the next one.   
Yeah, I'm always so competitive.  I always want to play.
