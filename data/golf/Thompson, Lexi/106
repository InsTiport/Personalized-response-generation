Q. Lexi, you just shot a superb 6-under par, eight birdies, two bogeys.  Talk a little bit about how you played this morning and what was the strength of your game?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a little bit of a slow start.  I was actually 1-over through three, I believe.  My caddie helped me out a lot.  He helped me out just being positive and trying to stick with my plan out here, which is a little different than usual.  I'm actually hitting a little baby cut around the golf course.  I never thought I would say those words.  But I'm just sticking to it, and I hit some great iron shots, which helped.
Q. Talk a little bit about your year.  It's been a crazy year, been emotional, but on and off the course, where would you assess where you are right now heading into some major championships coming up?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's definitely been a bit of an up-and-down year, but I've been playing some great golf.  I feel like the emotional stuff has definitely put a toll on me, but a lot better now knowing my mom is good and healthy, so that's been helping out a lot, and just trying to help -- just trying to work on my game a lot.  Just trying to keep positive, and I know my good golf is there, just got to stay patient with it going into the rest of the majors and the rest of the year.
Q. What specifically have you been working on, and what's going to be also your game plan going into this weekend?
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, my off-season I really just worked on my short game, just trying to improve that.  I've gotten a little inconsistent with my ball-striking, like I said, just hitting a cut around the golf course.  But it's been solid the last few days, so I'm just trying to stick with that and work on my off week that I go home after this week, and just trying to stay with it and see where it goes.
Q. I'm sure you wanted that last one on nine, but kind of evaluate your round.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a good round.  I started off a little slow, 1-over through 3, but I hit some great shots after that and made some really good putts.  I felt very comfortable over the putter, and my last few putts were actually very good strokes, just a little bit of a mystery.  You don't have to be too far off a putt.
Q. How good do you feel going into the weekend with the position you've put yourself in?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I feel good.  The way I hit it today was a lot more solid than the first day, so going to take those positive thoughts and move into the weekend.
Q. When you're going to be one of the final ones off tomorrow, does your mindset change at all going into the final two days?
LEXI THOMPSON: Not really any change of mindset, just stick with my game plan, focus on my targets out there, commit to my shots, do my routine, and just be relaxed as much as I can with my caddie out there.
Q. Did you feel like today was almost an extension of your last two holes yesterday?  It was more like a 20-hole round.
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, yeah, after the first few holes, yes.  I definitely started playing really well coming into the fourth hole there.  But it was nice to finish on that eagle-birdie yesterday.  Definitely gave me some confidence coming into today.
Q. Obviously you're playing well.  Do you feel like this course somewhat takes your power away?  There's some par-4s where you can't hit driver and stuff like that.  Do you feel like it's not as valuable?
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, I actually really love this golf course.  I get to hit a lot of drivers where I probably shouldn't, but I do anyway.  With the little cut that I'm actually hitting this week, it actually sets up well for a few of these tee shots that you have to hit around trees.  But there are a good amount of wedges on this golf course, but you still have to hit the shots.  So I mean, I love this golf course, and it's in great shape once again.
Q. With what you've been dealing with, what's the support been like here from the galleries this week?
LEXI THOMPSON: It's been amazing.  The crowds just got bigger and bigger as I went on today.  I teed off a little early, so not too many people on the first tee.  But it's great to see.  I absolutely love my fans, and especially to see little kids out here supporting and giving me high fives, it's honestly the best feeling ever.
Q. What is it like to be playing with a growing gallery?  What's that feeling like?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I love it.  There's nothing like it.  Just hearing the crowds cheer every time I make a birdie or hit a good shot or even if I have a rough hole, they're there cheering me on in between, and that means more to me than anything, that they're there for me even if I'm struggling.
