 Q.   Great round out there, co‑leader headed into the clubhouse at 4‑under.   Can you tell me what was working for you out on the course?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I would say I hit it pretty well off the tee.   I hit a good amount of fairways, but I rolled a few putts there in the beginning which gave me some confidence going into the rest of the round, but also missed a few putts.   But overall just a very steady round.   Very happy with the way I stayed positive.  
   
 Q.   This course really seems to be fitting your game.   It's definitely kind of a long hitters'‑‑ was that working to your advantage and how did your game plan go according to the course?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it definitely helps to be a little bit longer just because it's playing a lot softer, but it's just important to keep it in the fairways on any golf course, so I don't really care how far I hit it.   As long as I'm in the fairways I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   This event is a little bit unique with the double cut Friday and Saturday.   Does that change your mentality heading into the rest of the round?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I wouldn't say it changes my mindset.   I'm not really focusing on the cut.   Obviously I'm focusing on winning the golf tournament.   But taking one shot at a time, not getting ahead of myself, and focusing on doing my routine, I've been working on the mental side of the game with John Denney there in South Florida, so we'll see where it goes.
