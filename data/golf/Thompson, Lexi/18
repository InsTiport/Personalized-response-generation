  Q. What did you find out there and how are you going to take this momentum forward into the weekend?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, well, the course is in great shape for us and we can't get any better weather.  Maybe a little on the hotter side, but I'm from Florida so kind of used to it, but a great event, once again.  Different with no fans, but I've played some good golf the last two days, so just trying to keep up the confidence and keep up the changes that I've been working on and take it into the weekend, just focus on my game and one shot at a time and see where it goes.
