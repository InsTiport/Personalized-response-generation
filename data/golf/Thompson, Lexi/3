Q. Again, Lexi, there is a story that after the U.S. Open, you miss the cut and you practiced until your hands bled.  How would you describe the work you put in?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I came home a day early and I went to the range and hit balls for probably four to five hours.  On and off, of course.  Just taking little breaks trying to figure things out.
But, yeah, I hit until my hands bleed basically, so now I have tape all over them.  I just been working really hard overall on my game.  It wasn't just this past weekend, it's been nonstop working hard on my game.
Q. What have you found?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I've just been trying to find a good, solid tempo to where I trust my golf swing, I think.  For me it's all about trusting my golf shots, picking my lines, and really committing to them and knowing what my shot shape will do.
Q. For those of us who will never know what it's like to play a golf tournament with a brother caddying, what does that give you inside the ropes?
LEXI THOMPSON:   It's amazing honestly.  He's such a riot.  He's a character.  He can talk to a rock and make it laugh.  He's just a great personality to have out there.  He knows my game.  We play together when we're home.
So nice to have another set of eyes on my game.  Just to have him out there laughing with me and just keeping me loose is what I need.
Q. You have so many happy places in this game.  I think ANA, Galloway, New Jersey, and of course here at Tiburon.  What is it about this course specifically this fits your game so well?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I think what it is about this golf course is the atmosphere of it.  The hospitality that we get here at the Ritz and Tiburon is amazing and the course is always in great shape for us.
We always look forward to coming here.  I mean, definitely helps that I only drive about an hour and a half to come here.  It's always nice to be able to pack up the car and come here.
It's just a great layout and it's always in good shape for us, and we all look forward to it.
Q. Seven straight seasons with a win.  How much is that on your mind going into the weekend, that you have a chance to make it eight straight seasons with a win?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it's come up, but I'm not really thinking about that at all.  I'm just trying to go out there and have fun and enjoy myself and commit to my shots and just keep on trying to improve on my game and myself out there.  I'm not thinking about that.  Just taking one shot at a time.
