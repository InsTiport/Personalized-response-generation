 Q.  I know how badly you wanted to make that eagle putt on 18, but I actually sat in the grandstands so I could get the experience.  If I had a dollar for every time those fans were saying "Go, Lexi," when they knew you were going for the green, I'd have a lot of money in my pocket.  How special is it for you to be here and know the amazing fan support you get?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it truly is amazing.  Just the fans every year, such great crowds.  I had little girls out there supporting me and giving me high-fives between every hole every day.  I heard them when I was on my second shot up there cheering me on like they did last year.  Just gave me more motivation to go for that shot and pull it off.   
 Q.  A winner here, watching you walk across that very sacred ground in women's golf, and people reaching down to give you high-fives, that has to be one of the most special moments that you can have as an LPGA player.  What's it like for you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It really is.  It is very special.  This tournament has so much history behind it.  Just the whole atmosphere of this event, words can't even describe it.  Coming up the 18 and giving high-fives to everyone in the grandstands and having a standing ovation, it's pretty unbelievable.   
 Q.  You said last year how proud you were of yourself, and how much you fought back.  I know you've continued to learn about yourself.  As you look at where you are right now, where do you assess not only the state of your game, but just all the opportunities moving forward and where you are right now?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I've learned a lot about myself.  Every time I tee it up or every day that goes by I always learn something new about myself, what I need to work on and what I'm doing well to be proud of myself with.  Last year was definitely a learning curve.  I learned overall how strong I was.   
You can get through anything with positive attitudes.  There's been a lot thrown at me, but I'm really looking forward to this year, and just teeing it up at every event and seeing the fans like I did out here.   
 Q.  Not just strong mentally, but strong physically.  Watching these 348-yard drives, very impressive.  Congratulations, Lexi.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Thank you, appreciate it.
