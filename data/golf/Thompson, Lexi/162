Q. Had to feel pretty good making birdie on 8 there coming in?  I know you didn't want to come out here early.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely did.  I played well for the two holes, so I was just focusing on hitting the fairways and greens, giving myself some looks.
Q. What do you do for the next five hours until you tee off?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I don't even know.  I'm going to go in and probably eat a second breakfast.  No, basically just warm up, relax, and then go through my whole warm-up routine and come out later this afternoon and do it all over.
Q. What can that do for you playing so well those two holes there?
LEXI THOMPSON: Just give me confidence going into the afternoon.  You know, I've been hitting it well this week, just need a few more putts to drop, and I got one to drop on No. 8, so it's always nice to see early in the morning.
Q. How long was that one on 8?
LEXI THOMPSON: About 15 feet.
