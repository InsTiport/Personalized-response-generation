LEXI THOMPSON: There were so many great players just right behind me firing at me, so I had to play strong today.   
 Q.  It started with a four-shot lead but In Gee birdied the first three holes and closed it to one.  What was going through your mind at that stage?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I was just saying I had to make birdies to win this thing.  She was playing unbelievable with a three-birdie start there, and I knew I had to make birdies to stop her.  I was just trying to focus on my game and nobody else's out there.   
 Q.  You bogey the 9th and came back with an eagle at the 10th.  How big was that knowing you had another three shots between you and her?  
LEXI THOMPSON: That was a round changer.  Bogeying the 9th.  I knew 10 was a birdie hole.  But if my ball rolled down the slope to four feet and walking out with an eagle always helps on the scorecard there.   
 Q.  First American to win this tournament.  You now move past Stacy Lewis to become the No. 1 American in the world rankings.  What does that mean to you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It means the world to me.  I'm out here not only representing myself but representing my country being an American, and this being a huge year with the Olympics.  But I'm just trying to focus on my own game, not anybody else's.  Just trying to do my best and I'm very grateful for the opportunity that I'm out here following my dreams, honestly.
