 Q.  Nice clutch par save there at the last to sort of get your day going.  What did you see on the last couple holes?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I hit a great shot into 17.  Unfortunately, missed the putt, but I hit a little left drive on 18.  And really, just getting on the green was a good shot from where I was.  And making the par save was clutch coming into the third round this afternoon.   
And I'll take a little break now and re-warmup and get ready for the afternoon.   
 Q.  In the big scheme of the things, you're right there in it.  What do you think about your position so far?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I think I'm in a good position right now.  I'm going to stick with my game plan and what I've been working on with my swing and just how I've been challenging this golf course with driver and playing it aggressively.   
At the same time, playing the holes needed that you just you have to get a par and run and then take advantage of maybe a few of the par 5s I can reach and hopefully birdie.   
 Q.  When did you start going to the claw on the greens?  
LEXI THOMPSON: This week.   
 Q.  Why did you start going to the claw?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I've been looking for something that just flows a little better.  My brother Curtis came out this week, and he uses the claw.  He's like, you should try it.  It's really good.   
So I tried it in the practice rounds.  It felt really good so I've been sticking with it this week.  Any grip, there will always be a few putts that are iffy and bad putts.  That's golf.  I feel like I'm stroking it well.  And hopefully, I'll have two more good rounds.
