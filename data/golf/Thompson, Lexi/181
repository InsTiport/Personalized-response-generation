Q. By any means you have not played poorly in any regard, but a little bit of a tough finish.  Overall day, did you think you played well enough and Lydia just kind of took off?
LEXI THOMPSON: I played well enough in my first nine.  I struggled on the back.  I kind of lost my tee ball and didn't hit good iron shots, and it's kind of hard to beat somebody that shoots 63.  I mean, she played amazing.  She deserves it, and I mean, she ball-struck the heck out of this golf course and putted it really well.  You can't get much better than that.
Q. You played well all week; you have some good momentum going into next week.  This is going to be a hard one to swallow, but you played very, very well?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely.  Going to take a lot of positives out of this week going into next week, representing my country.  I'm really, really excited to play in Solheim.  This is definitely a win I want to have under my belt, the Evian Championship, but a lot of years to come.  I'll keep on coming back.  But Lydia deserves it.  She played amazing.
Q. I'm sure a lot of people were watching, and just such a dynamic young duo out there, it was exciting.  You guys are friends; was it fun to watch each other play well going back and forth?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, yeah, overall it was a fun day.  It's fun to make birdies, but also to watch another competitor make birdies and feed off each other, it's always nice.  She has a great personality, very laid-back, and that helps her out on the golf course.  She's got a great attitude out there.
Q. What impressed you the most about Lydia today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Probably just -- I don't even think she made a mistake.  She was just so consistent today, just played fearless golf.  Everybody knows she's a great ball striker and amazing putter, so it just showed today.
