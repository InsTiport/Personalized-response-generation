 Q.  You survived; long day.  How do you feel right now?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a very long day.  We got a lot more golf in than we expected, so that's always a good side of things.  Weather wasn't as bad.   
But, yeah, we were down early in our second match, Cristie and I, and we fought back and got it back to, I believe we're 1-up now.   
Few more to go whenever we shall play.   
 Q.  We hear the golf course is playing crazy long.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  How is it out there?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it is.  First round today they had set it up pretty difficult, not too smart, and then they tuck the pins.  Girls were having 3-woods and I was hitting 4-irons and it was just hard.   
Pars were winning hole.  They moved a few tees up in the second round, which was good, and a little bit more fair.  Still hard pin locations, though.   
 Q.  I mean, it's a competition.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Exactly.   
 Q.  What's the overall feeling for you guys as you head to the break?  Seems like you're all playing well.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely.  It was a good turn on -- starting on No. 7.  We won a few holes, so definitely momentum going in the right direction.  Yeah, a lot of positive things going our way.  We know we'll have to make birdies to win the match.
