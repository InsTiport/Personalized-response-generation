Q. (Inaudible.)
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely.  I played well all week.  And I got paired up with Carlota a lot of the rounds.  I think she shot 6- or 7-under today.  It was a good match to watch.  In best ball, we were killing it.  She's a tough one to beat, I knew that coming into today.
Q. You knew how important this match was.  Is that where some of the disappointment lies and the emotions when you walked off the green, even though you played really well?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, any match out here is very important.  The points are huge out here.  I'm happy we all squared it.  But it's not really the way I wanted to all square the match.  It's an unfortunate bogey on the last hole.  But overall I played great.  So did Carlota.
