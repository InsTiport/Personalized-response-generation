 Q. This is one finale in Wounded Warrior Project. All we've doing this on the weekend and donating. You're very passionate about supporting the Armed Forces and Wounded Warriors, particularly. How special is that to see that come together here? How cool is that to see that come to a close here this week?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's incredible. I think what the LPGA has done with the Wounded Warrior Project is amazing. I've been involved with the Wounded Warrior Project ever since I turned professional at the LPGA Classic, I donated to them.   
I've gotten to meet some amazing people along the way. I can't even describe the stories I've heard from them. It's an honor to meet them and to be able to thank them in person for their service and what they do, and be able to come out here, follow our dreams and play golf for a living and have them do what they do.   
But to see them out here, I think there was a few playing in the Proâ€‘Am yesterday, which was great to see. I did Caddy for the Cure last year and it's great to give back to the Warriors and it's great to see the huge amount of donation that we've made this year for the Wounded Warrior Project. So I'm glad that I'm a part of it.
