Q. Couple of quick thoughts on your round today?LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, overall, I had a consistent day.  I hit some good iron shots out there and dropped a few putts on top of it.  So it was a fun round.  My caddie, Benji, and I, we just had fun in between shots and was very relaxed.Q. Overall, your impressions on this week, being the first time with KPMG and the PGA coming on board?LEXI THOMPSON: Oh, it was an amazing week.  It was a whole different atmosphere than the last few years.  It definitely felt like a major championship, not only the fans, the venue here at Westchester Country Club.  The course is in great shape for us.  But PGA of America, KPMG and Zurich did an amazing job for the tournament.Q. How do you take this momentum from this solid Sunday going forward with the rest of the year?LEXI THOMPSON: Just take a lot of positives from it knowing that I can pull off a round on Sunday here at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship.  It means a lot and I'm going to take a lot of confidence going into my upcoming tournaments.
