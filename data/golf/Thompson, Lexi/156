 Q.  A little bit of struggles today, but overall a great week, a great experience.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  I struggled today, ball-striking, and the bad ball-striking didn't give me many birdie chances, so I struggled a bit with the putter, as well.  Ended well with another eagle on 18, so made a good jump.  It's always a great week here at the ANA.  Lydia played amazing and so did all the other players at the top there.   
 Q.  Slow start; did that just make it tough to catch up?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I mean, I was 2-over through 3, so it was tough to get back.  I didn't hit it good off the tee.  I didn't hit many fairways, so it was hard to recover.  I got lucky on a few that I got some shots.  Yeah, just overall tough day.
