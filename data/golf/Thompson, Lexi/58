LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I hit it great today.  I just hit a lot of good putts.  They were just over the edges.  I had some really hard putts to read, so I'm going to blame it on that.   
 Q.  For your first time out, though, how do you feel about the position?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I feel good about it.  I know my game's in a good spot.  I've been working on it.  It's not as good as it was at CME, but it's still right there.  It wasn't much of an off-season, but I've been practicing hard.  I'll have three weeks off after this, so I'll be practicing even more to get ready for Asia.   
 Q.  Last thing is you're still fairly close to your home.  Do you get many people coming up to see you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I have a few, like I have my boyfriend up here.  He came out.  And a few people we know will be around on the weekend, just like neighbors and people that follow me that we've become really good friends with, family friends.  Yeah, they'll be out here to support me this weekend, which will be really nice.   
 Q.  And a comfort factor, just the look and feel of Florida, how much does that help?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it helps out a lot.  Being able to drive to this tournament because my mom cooks every night because we just stay at the resort and she's able to.  It feels like I'm at home just playing in a tournament, which is a lot more relaxing.
