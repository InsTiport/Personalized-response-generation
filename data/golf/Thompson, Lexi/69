Q. Tell me how you feel coming off the golf course right now.  Tough 1st Round, maybe.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  Felt pretty good.  Definitely left some putts out there but, overall, hit it very well.
I was in a lot of bunkers, seemed like, but, you know, I hit it well off the tee, definitely a lot of positives.  Needed to hit my irons a bit closer.  Very solid.
Q. How is the golf course, considering all the rain it's gotten?
LEXI THOMPSON: It's just -- it's bad in some spots but it really -- it did dry up a lot overnight.  Not getting so much rain overnight definitely helped and did being super hot.
I was really amazed it wasn't as wet as yesterday.  Yesterday was a bit of a mud-fest.  Yeah, they're doing the best that they can with it.  That's all we can ask for.  I did get a few mud balls but everybody is playing it that way.
Q. What are your takeaways that you work on from today going into tomorrow's 2nd Round?
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, I fought strong today.  I could have faltered but I got up and down where I needed to and just going to go practice my putting a little bit and take a positive going into tomorrow.
