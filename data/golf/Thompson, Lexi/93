LEXI THOMPSON: (Recording in progress. ) I bounced back, had a good attitude out there, and played some solid golf coming in.  Just left a few putts, but stroked it very well.   
Hopefully play some good golf the next three days.   
 Q.  How important was that putt on 18, making that par, for your confidence?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was very important.  I hit a great iron shot in there and just landed a pace past the hole.  (Indiscernible.)...was staring it down.   
Yeah, I put a good stroke on that second putt, so it's definitely important going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Do you feel like sort of getting this first round under your belt you can start attacking this golf course?  It's a place you've performed well in the past.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, coming into the day I was playing aggressively, you know, hitting drivers and a lot of the 3-woods out there.  I play this golf course pretty aggressively, so I didn't have a different game plan.   
Yeah, getting the first round under my belt with a 1-under par, I'm definitely going to play aggressive going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Kind of looking at the performance today and what happened, what do you think is key for the next few days?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I think just play like I did my last 17 holes.  Play like I did and hopefully a few more putts drop.  Like I said, I stroked it very well; just a matter of a ball or half ball off in the reads.
