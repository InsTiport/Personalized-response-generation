LEXI THOMPSON: He actually came here, I believe, Wednesday just to help me out and see if he could figure out some of my putting.  I ended up trying the claw grip and just stuck with it.  It feels very good.  Obviously, there's some putts out there that I'm like, eh, maybe not so good.  But I feel comfortable with it, and I think that's the important part.
Q. You hadn't made a birdie on a par 5 all week until today.  Today you did fantastic.  Four birdies on the par 5s, including the eagle on 15.  Take us through your second here on the 15th.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I had about 240 to the front edge.  It was a little into the wind, and I was like, all right, I'm going to have to smash it 3 wood and it was a good bit of a run-up there.  I figure it might land at 230.  And if it doesn't, it will be an easy putt from the front fringe.  And it bounced on.
Q. It was a fantastic shot.  And then about 30 feet for your eagle.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, about 25, 30 feet.  My caddie had a good read on this putt.  It was uphill so I knew I could be aggressive.  Left the pin in, in case.  And it was just a good shot and overall a little fist bump.  I usually don't do that, but pull it out there.
Q. As Paul Azinger said, that thing could have gone in a thimble.  It was just so perfect.
In a top ten mode, once again, you're right near the top of the leaderboard.  What's the key tomorrow to bring this thing home?
LEXI THOMPSON: I think really just stick to my game plan, what I've been doing the last three days.  I've been working on my game so much in general.  I think it's more focusing on myself and my game, not really focusing on the outcome and anybody else playing in the field.  Just keep on focusing on what I'm working on with my swing, commit to my lines, and make sure I do my routine.  We'll see how it goes.
