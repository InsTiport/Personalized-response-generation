  Q. A phenomenal day out there where conditions again were right.  Take us through this last round, especially the eagle when you made the turn.
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, the eagle was definitely a good little boost to get somewhat up there.  I knew what she was at making the turn, so I knew I kind of had to make a run.  I just tried to stay within my game and focus on one shot at a time, and that definitely helped.  I bogeyed the next hole, but I just tried to stay in it and birdie coming in.
 Q. Were you looking at leaderboards throughout the day at all?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   I think I only did once, and the one time I did I saw that she was at 16, so I was like, all right, well, I've got to do pedal down right now and just play aggressive, which I did the whole week, but I think the main thing is to just focus on your own game and not really get involved in leaderboards.
 Q. What does it mean to have such a stellar week at Gainbridge on a course that you were really liking yesterday?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I think it's great, just to begin the season with a few good events just to get my confidence up.  I've been working extremely hard on my game in my off weeks, so that's the biggest thing for me, just to see my hard work paying off, so I'm going to continue to do that, go into Ocala with the same attitude I did coming into here, and see where it goes.
 Q. What was the main focus over the last month that you had in between events?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Well, for me it's just been short game, obviously, working on that a lot, a few hours a day.  And then just getting my ball-striking more and more consistent, especially off the tee.  I hit two bad drives today, but overall it was great with the week.  I hit a lot of 3-woods and I hit them pretty good.  Just going to take that into next week.
 Q. And you putted really well today; what did you make of that?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I definitely putted better coming towards the end of yesterday's round and into today's, just getting more comfortable and just letting my stroke happen and really just pick a line with my caddie and really commit to it.
