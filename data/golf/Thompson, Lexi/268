   MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Lexi Thompson into the interview room. Congratulations on your 6-under 66 today. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Thank you. 
 MODERATOR: Can you just take me through the round a little bit and tell me what it is about this course that seemed to suit your game today. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, well, I just played pretty consistent today. You know, just focused on one shot at a time. I dropped some putts, so that went for me. You know, I just focused on one shot and didn't get ahead of myself.
 MODERATOR: You got to come out and play this course before pretty much anybody else did. What was it like? I know we talked about the shape of this course and all the renovations they've made, but what did you notice right away and how was it?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: This course is amazing right now. It's in perfect condition for us. I was the first to hit a shot out here, so there was no divots or ball marks. So it was just like so pure, and still is obviously.
 I just love coming to this tournament. It's one I look forward to every year.
 MODERATOR: You played well the last time you were in Alabama at Avnet back in April. Is there something about these Robert Trent Jones courses that seem to fit your game?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I really like 'em. I get to hit a lot drivers, so that's an advantage to me. It's just a great setup, and they're always in great condition for us.
 MODERATOR: I know it's been a busy summer for you. In addition to playing LPGA Tour events and overseas, you've also just went to Q-School and played the first stage and one by 10 shots. What was that experience like, and what are you taking heading into the second stage of Q-School that will be coming up later this month?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, going into first stage was kind of crazy. I just came back from France and went straight there, so, I mean, it was a little hectic. Just went out and free swung and it went my way. I had a lot fun with my dad, and, you know, same thing here. Gave me a lot confidence heading into this tournament.
 MODERATOR: Questions.

 Q. If you qualify, are you still under the age limit?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: If I qualify, I can be a full-time member, yeah. 

 Q. What day was it when you hit the first shot?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I think Sunday. Yeah, we drove up, took the whole day, and then played Sunday morning I think like around 8:00 or something like that. 

 Q. So you hit 18 greens. Where does this round rank for you?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, it's definitely up there. I mean, like I said, I just focused on one shot and thought about tempo. Just do that for the next three days and hopefully it'll all go well.
 But, you know, it was just a great day. I had a lot of fun. I had a great group with Belen and Jane. Just an overall good day. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I definitely left some out there. You're going to miss some and make some. You just have to be patient. I mean, if you're hitting the greens and getting close, you just have to hope that they fall eventually. You can't get impatient, because then you'll start hitting it bad.

 Q. This is a significant tournament for 17-year-old Janie Jackson from Huntsville, Alabama. She was saying this morning she was just ridden with nerves. She I got in the hazards a little bit, but she said she really looks up to you despite the fact that you're younger than she's. She said you're one of her role models. How would you encourage her being a younger golfer among some of the best in the world trying to take in this really, really good opportunity and build on it?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I actually talk to her on Facebook, so I keep in touch with her. I think she said she was trying to qualify, but I guess she's pro now. 

 Q. She did qualify. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Oh, okay. So, yeah, I mean, I was nervous in my first pro event too. It was the Open when was 12. It was crazy. 
 I would just have to say you have to take one tournament at a time. If you don't do well, you've just got to go to the next one. You can't get one bad shot or hole in your head, because then you're just going to go downhill. You have to keep on going to the next one. 

 Q. Do you have get over the initial nerves? Is there ever a point where that starts to level off and you're able to clear mindedly think about your game?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, first shot usually I'm a little nervous. I would think that's typical for everybody. It just shows that you care that much. You're going to get nervous. 
 After the first shot I'm good to go. Just remember to breathe and just free swing.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, pretty much. You got to get through it, so it's all learning experience.
