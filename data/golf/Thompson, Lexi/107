Q. Not exactly the round you were hoping to have today.  What were the conditions and how do you feel?
LEXI THOMPSON: The weather was absolutely perfect for us.  Little windier than the last two days, but it was perfect out.
I hit it a lot better than even the first and second day.  Just couldn't really get anything going.  Just missed a you few putts here and there.  U.S. Open golf course, that's what gets you.
Q. Being able to finish, at least getting one low number on the card, how good was that for you going into tomorrow?
LEXI THOMPSON: I'm going to go out there and try my best, do my same routine and commit to my shots, pick my targets, just see where it goes.  I have nothing to lose, I'm just going to fire at pins.  Play smart when I need to, but it would be nice to finish on a low score.
Q. Do you feel the course is drastically changing day-by-day?
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, it's a lot different than the practice rounds.  Practice rounds were playing very tough just with the longer clubs in and it being firmer, especially the greens being firm.  The rain definitely helps out just softening up the course, being able to go at a few more pins and stopping them.  A few of the pin locations, if you have spin on the ball, it actually -- it's even harder to get close to.
Q. I know you were asked this yesterday.  How much extra pressure do you feel with the guest on the grounds?
LEXI THOMPSON: I don't feel extra pressure at all.  This is his golf course.  It's cool to have the President of the United States.  I'm just out here playing golf, playing the U.S. Women's Open.
