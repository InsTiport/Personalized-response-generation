   MODERATOR: We have Alexis Thompson playing in her third event as a professional. Finished tied for 10th at the U.S. Women's Open a couple weeks ago. Can you talk about your week is far here at the Evian Masters.
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's been great so far. I've had a lot of fun just looking around seeing all the great views, especially on the course seeing the mountains and the lake. It's just a beautiful place, and I'm really excited I'm here.
 MODERATOR: How do you find the golf course so far this week? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: It's really nice. It has a nice set up. Pretty tight. Greens are small, so definitely gonna have to have good iron play for the week. 
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. At 15 and so years of age, you don't have yet, I suppose, an LPGA full card complete. When do you expect to have it, and how would you design your next season, 2011?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, yeah, I don't have my LPGA Tour card. I'm just playing on my sponsor's exemptions now and just playing in events I can get in. 
 I'm not really sure when I'll petition or anything like that, so we're just going one tournament at a time.

 Q. If you don't have points enough to directly qualify for next season, are you going to Q-School?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I'm gonna be getting in on sponsor's exemptions into tournaments, so they're just gonna be inviting me.

 Q. You're still attending university?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I'm homeschooled. 

 Q. I would like to know how is play golf during this period? Do you find difficult? I know that several tournaments shut down or decreases their prize money. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it feels good. I'm not really worried about the money. I'm just gonna go out there and try to play my game and just hope everything goes well. Just play consistent and hope for the best. 

 Q. Did you feel less pressure to be here in Europe than in States?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I don't feel any pressure at all in any of my tournaments. Just try to play my game. I have nothing to lose out here, so just try to play well and do the best I can.
 MODERATOR: Just curious, you cashed a pretty sizable check after the U.S. Women's Open being 15. Did you splurge on anything? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I got it right when I was leaving for here, so it was pretty great. I took a picture of it. I haven't thought about anything to spend it on. Maybe car shopping at the end of the year. That'll be fun.

 Q. What did you expect from this tournament?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: My goal is probably to top 10. That's my first goal. I'm just gonna try to play well. The greens are pretty difficult out here, so I think if I have good iron play and good putting, I'll be good out here.

 Q. How do the other players react? Are you accepted by them? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Oh, yeah. They treat me great. They always give my advices, good luck, hope for the best for me. They've just given me a lot of support. It's been really nice.

 Q. No jealousy? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No. No, I don't think so. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No. I have a month off, and then I go to the Canadian Open.

 Q. Back from your youth time, if I may say so, when you were about to qualify for the U.S. Open, did anyone tell you not to do it? To stay home? You're too young?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No, I've gotten a lot of support throughout my golfing years. When I qualified, I just got a lot of support and good lucks from my family and friends. They were all just really excited for me.

 Q. At what age did you become a single figure handicap-wise?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I don't know. Probably pretty young. Few years ago.

 Q. Before ten?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, probably around ten. 

 Q. Was it difficult to leave high school?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I went to elementary school and started homeschooling in sixth grade. It was my decision. I wanted to be home so I could practice a lot more. When I went to school I only got like two hours of practice every day. It just wasn't enough. Homeschooling was my choice, and my parents', and I really like it.

 Q. What about college? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: College isn't really what I'm thinking about right now. I might take college courses in the future.

 Q. At home? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah.

 Q. Are you traveling with your family around somehow, or on your own?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I'm traveling with my dad and my agent.

 Q. He's your manager? Caddie? Doctor? Psychologist? He's everything?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: My caddie is my dad, so it's great. 

 Q. So he's your psychologist at the same time?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. He gives me little tips on the golf course. 

 Q. Who do you like as a kid as a player?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Growing up I've always looked up to my brother that plays on the tour. Just watching him and following in his footsteps was great for me.
 On the women's side, probably Nancy Lopez or Annika Sorenstam. 

 Q. What is your brother's name?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Nicholas Thompson.
