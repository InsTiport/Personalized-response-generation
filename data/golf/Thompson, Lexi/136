Q. Looking back at your record in this championship, you've had a Top-20 obviously, but you've never really managed to get right in the thick of it.  Do these conditions at Woburn suit you better, do you feel, than the links styles?
LEXI THOMPSON: I feel like this golf course setup is a little bit more suited for my game rather than the super-firm grounds and the extreme winds on the water.  But it's something to get used to.  I'm a Florida girl, so I'm used to getting my yardage and landing it right there, instead of playing to bounce out, which you have to do with British Open golf.
Q. You've had a very interesting season, just won the International Crown with your American Team mates last week.  This is the interim, if you like, before the Rio Olympics.  Just assess the strength of your game right now, and indeed those of your American colleagues.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, well last week was great there at the UL International Crown.  But winning for my country, there's nothing like it, and to have the team that I had, it was an amazing week.  We all played very well and I was just happy to be a part of it and representing my country.
This is a great tune up for the Olympics coming up.  I'm super excited.  I have a few-week stretch to go home and relax, but I'm going to focus on the week here.
Q. You didn't get off to the best of starts yesterday doubling the first, but you made up for it with a birdie today and a 5-under par 67; how satisfied do you feel?
LEXI THOMPSON: I played the first hole a little bit better than yesterday.  Just got a few bad breaks on that first hole but I managed to shoot even yesterday and came back from it.
It was a good day out there today.  I hit it well.  I scrambled on a few holes but that's what you have to do out here.
Q. Some people say it's playing tougher, but not for you.  What clicked today, just more knowledge of the golf course?
LEXI THOMPSON: I would say exactly that, and I just made a few more putts.  I think I had 26, 27 putts today, so that always helps out a scorecard and my round.
Q. Where would you say 5-under will stand going into the weekend?
LEXI THOMPSON: It all depends on the conditions.  If it continues to rain and get windy, I think I'll be inside Top 15, Top-20 going into the weekend.  I don't even know what place I'm in right now.  We'll just see.  I'm very happy the way I played today and we'll see how the weekend goes.
Q. We spoke about how this is not a typical British Open golf course; will you stick to the game plan you've been using so far coming into the weekend?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I am.  It's more of a parkland golf course out here, tree-lined, not quite the British Open style.  But I only hit like one or two drivers out here.  I'm going to stick to my game plan, hit a lot of 3-woods and hybrids out there, and see how the conditions go.
Q. Any highlights?
LEXI THOMPSON: I birdied 10.  I hit a pitching wedge to about ten feet.  Made the putt there.
I birdied 12.  I hit a lob-wedge.
Q. What did you hit into the green?
LEXI THOMPSON: Lob-wedge.  I hit hybrid, lob-wedge, to about eight feet and made that putt.
15, the par 5, I actually hit a 6-iron.  I had hooked my drive into the bunker and had to lay up pretty far back.  Hit a 6-iron to about three feet and birdied.
Then I birdied 16.  I hit it into the green-side bunker and holed out.
And 17, 18, I parred.
Q. Today was obviously a lot better than yesterday, even though conditions were a little bit tougher.  Was there anything specific that you changed?
LEXI THOMPSON: I didn't really change anything.  I didn't hit it bad yesterday.  I just got off to a rough start and had to scramble back.  Today I started off with a birdie, started three shots better going into No. 2, so that always helps.
Just sticking to my game plan, my routine and picking my lines off the tees and that's all I really have to do out here.
Q. Does this course suit you?
LEXI THOMPSON: This course suits me a lot better than links, and having a lot of doglegs little helped me out, especially with my 3-wood, because that's usually my shot shape.
It helps out, but I'm just trying to get used to the British Open style and then I come to a parkland golf course that's tree lined.  But it's a golf course and it's in really great shape for us.
