 Q.  Final round 69.  You still finish 10-under par.  How would you sum up the week?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It was a good week.  Besides yesterday, I played great golf.  Yeah, I played really good today.  I hit it well and made some good putts.  Overall, positives from this week.   
 Q.  I know it's been some terrible conditions across the four days, but would you say you've enjoyed your time in Scotland?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely.  I always enjoy coming over here.  It's all a matter of weather conditions, what we get over here, but this is what we expect and this is what it's like.  We expect to play in it once we come over here.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy testing yourself in the testing conditions?  Enjoy might be the wrong word.  
LEXI THOMPSON: I don't know about enjoy but it's a challenge, though, and that's what golf is, and I always enjoy a challenge.   
 Q.  A number of the names at the very, very top of the leaderboard have played in the Ladies Scottish Open last week to kind of acclimatise themselves to the links conditions.  Would you say that's something you would be interested in playing next year, putting on your schedule?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely.  It is a good warmup to get used to the weather conditions coming over.  And then before a major, it's important.  It's all just a matter of being rested for the big events this year and making sure I have my time at home; that's needed.
