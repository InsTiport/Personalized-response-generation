   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Alexis Thompson, once again, you are joining us in the interview room at Navistar LPGA Classic. You kind of had the one bogey on the fourth hole, and from then on it was playing like a pro. How did it feel?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, that fourth hole, that was a pretty stupid mistake. But, you know, I bounced back and I made birdie next hole. So that was good. That definitely turned it around.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: That's great. Do we have questions?  
  
  Q. Were you more nervous today than yesterday?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I was a little nervous in the beginning. You know, I don't know why, but I was just playing it as a normal tournament. I mean, maybe just because I was at the top. I don't know.  
 But I'm just gonna go out there on the weekend and just be relaxed and just play my game.  
  
  Q. What's it like to know that you're one of five at the top of the leaderboard? It better being the only one people are chasing, or kind of one of a group of people that everyone's chasing.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, that's better. I like to come back. I like to come to first from behind, so that's good.  
 But I'm just gonna try to play well tomorrow and the next day and just shoot under. That's just my goal: just to shoot understand every day.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I definitely did. I mean, there was more people out there today. I mean, they always cheer me on. I just love crowds. I mean, I like that they cheer me on. It just gets me hyped up.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I just want to shoot under part the next two days. Maybe in the 60s would be nice both days. I think I would be up there, so...  
  
  Q. Did the birdie at 17 help your confidence after missing a couple shorter putts coming in and knowing that could get you into double digits?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, that's what -- it was actually really funny. When I went into that hole, my dad was like, Get one on the last two holes and get into double digits.  
 I was like, Oh, that's nice. After I missed that, I was like, Okay. Because I didn't get many uphillers. They were all sliders.  
 Once I do the that one, I was like, Okay, I'm gonna hit this one a little bit firm. I made it. I'm just like, Okay, maybe I should do that a little bit more often.  
  
  Q. What I'm hearing a lot and we're all hearing a lot is that you play unbelievably well for your age. Do you feel 14?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I can say I'm really mature for 14. I would definitely say that. But, I mean, I don't know. I just play golf every day. I mean, I'm young. That's the only difference.  
 I don't know, I'm pretty good for a young player. I don't know. I'm 14 and I just love to play golf. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. What would it be like if you're paired with someone like Lorena Ochoa or Laura Davies or somebody like that that has the history, track record, obviously probably that you've looked up to and seen them the past couple years?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, that would be really awesome. I mean, that would be a great group. I mean, I got to play with Juli Inkster at the Open. That was awesome just knowing what she did and her history.  
 I mean, she's great with crowds. Everybody loves her. I'm just hoping I get some good players. That'll be really cool.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, probably. But, I mean, I'm an amateur, and I'm just gonna look at it and just be like, Whatever. Because I just try to come into these and just play well. It's just good competition for me. Best in the world, so...  
  
  Q. You're one of ESPN's ten plays of the day yesterday, you're on the cover of USA Today. How does it feel to go from a 14 year old in Florida to all of a sudden in the spotlight?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, that was pretty cool. I didn't actually hear it, but I looked it up on ESPN. That was pretty cool.  
 Then I saw the picture. I actually didn't see to this morning in the newspaper. I saw it and I was like, Whoa, that's a big picture. That's really cool, so pretty exciting.  
  
  Q. The rest of the tournament, what's next?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: In this tournament?  
  
  Q. Yeah.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I'm just gonna try to shoot under. I mean, if I keep on hitting it like I am, I think I'll definitely play well. I missed few more putts today. I think I used them all up yesterday.  
 Just gonna try to shoot under and just get my ball striking to be good and just hopefully have a few putts drop.  
  
  Q. Coming out here with the "Passionately Pink Day," what's it been like? You go out and play golf, but there are obviously a couple more initiatives the players are part of. What's it been like seeing the pink around the course today?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I actually didn't know, and then I saw these all over. I'm like, Oh, I gotta put one of those on, because my mom, yeah, she a survivor.  
 So that's really cool. I mean, I wish I would have wore pink, but I don't know if I have pink.  
 But, that's great. I love that when people support that. I do, too.  
  
  Q. Obviously you hoped to do what you've done, but could you realistically have expected to do what you've done?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I definitely knew I could've competed in this event if my game was on. I mean, it is. And, I mean, I think I hit my driver a lot better today, so I don't know how I scored better yesterday and not today. But I don't know.  
 But if my ball striking is good for the next two days, I definitely think I can compete and just stay up there at the top.
