Q. All right, Lexi, can you just talk about your round and how you felt out there today.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was overall a very steady round.  I hit a lot of greens; gave myself a lot of birdie opportunities; just left a few short.
But, yeah, I just left some out there on the greens, but overall good day.  Happy we beat the rain.
Q. Yeah sure, I was about to say, when you tee'd off it started to pick up a little bit and was kind of on and off.  Did that have any effect or you just kind of play through that?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a little annoying rain because it was on and off, but it wasn't too hard so it was pretty easy to play in.  It wasn't too difficult.
It's all about managing the rain and having a good relationship with your caddie out there when it starts to rain a little bit harder.
Q. Going into tomorrow, what are you looking to maybe improve on?  I saw you left a couple up there short, but other than that, looked like you were pretty steady like you said.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I hit it very well, so hopefully continue that into tomorrow and just have few more putts roll in for me.
But we can't thank the greens staff enough here to have the course in the best shape possible with all the rain that we've been getting here.
