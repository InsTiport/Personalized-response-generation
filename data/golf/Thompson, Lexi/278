  Q. All right, Lexi. 1-under to start. How did you play?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I played pretty good. I got one bad break on one hole. The ball got stuck up in the trees. But I came back, so that's all that matters.  
  
  Q. Just impressions on your first round overall.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, I'll just hopefully do good tomorrow and play like I did today.   
 And you know, I hit it good overall. The course is in great shape for us, and it got a lot windier than I thought it was going to, so we'll see.  
  
  Q. What was the ruling on 18?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Oh, it was ground-under-repair, and then I dropped and I was still in the ground-under-repair standing in it, so I had to take full relief.  
  
  Q. What hole did you hit into the tree?  
 THE MODERATOR: It was 16.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: (Laughs). I can't even remember now.  
  
  Q. What did you hit into it? Driver?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I hit 3-wood. I actually thought it was going to be good. I picked up my tee like it was a good shot, and then I see everybody like, oh, where is it. It was stuck up in the tree. That was nice.  
  
  Q. How much did the wind bother you or where did it bother you?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: It didn't really bother me. I'm sort of used to the wind down in Florida. It usually blows like 15 every day. So I'm sort of used to it.  
  
  Q. Club being on the par-5 over here, you made 3?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: 7-iron.  
  
  Q. 7-iron? To?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: 15 feet.  
  
  Q. You made eagle there yesterday, too, didn't you?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. That was a 4-iron.  
  
  Q. New favorite hole?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. When it's down wind I like it. (Laughs).   
  
  Q. All right. Anything else? Thanks, Lexi.
