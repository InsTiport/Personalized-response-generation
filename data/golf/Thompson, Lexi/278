 Q. A bit of a roller coaster today. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. 

 Q. Kind of open with that, just your thoughts on the round. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, just I played bad. I had three doubles and a triple, so not good.

 Q. So there was a lost ball on 2? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah.

 Q. Is that what happened?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. I lost it and then I hit 3-wood and hit it right and missed the green.

 Q. Tell me about the eagle on 10. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I had 110, yeah, 110 and I just holed it with a gap wedge. 

 Q. You made one other eagle?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. On No. 3 I hit a 6-iron to about 20 feet and made it. 

 Q. So what about the emotions from 2 to 3?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. I know. And I birdied the first hole, too, so it was just a bunch of no pars, that's for sure. That wasn't like how I play.

 Q. Are you emotionally drained right now?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No, not really. I'm pretty mad about the way I hit it. I mean that's just not how I play.

 Q. What was the overriding culprit on the day in terms of what wasn't working?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: My tee shots were bad, you know, just didn't hit my driver good. 
 You know, my putting was not great, my chipping. Pretty much everything.

 Q. I saw you birdied 16. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Uh-huh.

 Q. And then 17, another three-putt?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. 

 Q. How long was that last putt, the second putt?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: It was like two to three feet.

 Q. Was that just concentration?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I really don't know. I have no idea what I did there. It was just terrible. 

 Q. What can you take away, what can you learn from this week?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: It was just a great experience, and I think mostly positive things out of it. I wish I would have done better. It just didn't happen.

 Q. Do you think pressure was a factor at all?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Um, I wasn't really nervous then. I wasn't really worried about it, but yesterday I was on the first three holes, but I don't know what today was. I really don't. It just was not me playing. I don't know. 

 Q. Thank you.
