 Q. Is that a good attitude to take, just, you know, what, you're going into tomorrow and you're doing the best that -- you have the low amateur score pretty much for the year of anyone that's been on tour, so you've already accomplished something.
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, it's just one of those days that your game is off. That's golf. I mean, you have those days where it just doesn't feel right, and that's what it was like. 
 I probably had like ten duck hooks out there. I was just like, Wow, that's not very good. But, you know what, it happens, so... 

 Q. Is it good to get it out of your system today and look forward to tomorrow?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna hit a few more balls and just try to be confident and go low tomorrow, I hope. 

 Q. Tell us a little about your call from Nancy Lopez and what that meant to you. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I was in the car on the way here I think, yeah, yesterday, or the day before. I just see Nancy Lopez, and I'm like, Oh, that's usual. (Laughter.) 
 I'm like, Wow. She answered, and she was just like, Great job. You're doing awesome. Just keep it up. She just had a lot of advice for me at Solheim that was great for match play. She just helped me out a lot.

 Q. What do you think was the biggest challenge today, which hole?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, pretty obvious. (Laughter.) No, I mean, yeah, No. 6. I really don't know where that drive was. I don't know. It had to be the biggest duck hook I've ever seen. 

 Q. And then from there just...
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: From there I actually hit a good shot. I had a 4-iron, and then it hit that thing and came all the way back down. I'm like, That's just great. It came all the way back down.
 My chipping is a little off. I'm catching sort of like flyers that are going way long, so...
 My only double obviously, so...

 Q. Good luck going into tomorrow. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Thank you.
