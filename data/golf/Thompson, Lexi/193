Q.   Another great round today, finishing 6‑under and just two off the lead.   What was working for you today? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Overall just another steady ball‑striking day.   Got unlucky on a few shots, caught a flier on one and went through into the water on 15, but saved par there, so overall positives out of the day.

Q.   Looks like you had a bogey on No.1 but were able to bounce back.   What was kind of your mindset?   You talked about your mental game you were working on recently. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I definitely am.   I just focusing on staying positive, even if I hit a bad shot, just going to the next one very positive.   I'm working with John Denney down in South Florida, and he's just been focusing on my routine and breathing, and it's a huge part of golf.

Q.   Have you seen kind of a lot of aftereffects working on your mental game and kind of benefits for that, as well?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, definitely.   It's just a lot less stress during the whole day, and I mean, if you just go into a shot more positive and just saying you're going to pull this shot off, it's amazing how much it works.

Q.   What's the strategy headed into the weekend? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Same mindset going into the weekend.   Focus on my routine and just go out there and fire at pins, try and make birdies, and see where it goes.   Supposedly it's going to be good weather like the last few days, and the course is in great shape for us.
