Q.   Just tell me about this feeling of what it's like to finally be a major champion. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   It's a great feeling.   This is what I've worked so hard for.   This was one of my goals coming into the year, to win a major.   I've always seen myself winning a Kraft Nabisco.   It's such a huge honor with all the history behind the tournament.   It's just a dream come true.

Q.   You talked a lot about working on your putting.   Front nine today only 13 putts that you needed to get off to such a hot start.   What difference has this made for you, this change?
LEXI THOMPSON:   It's a huge difference, just knowing that I'm a great putter and I just get up to the putt confidently.   I think putting is all about confidence, and I've worked on it extremely hard, and just seeing the ball go in is a huge confidence builder for me.

Q.   Only one bogey over your last 55 holes here.   That's pretty impressive.   How were you able to be just so consistent? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   I would say just driving the ball pretty well here.   You have to hit it in the fairway, and if you miss it, just miss it small.   I think just staying into it mentally.   When I had a bad hole, I'd just fight right back with it, or if I hit a bad shot just know that I can get it up‑and‑down or get it on the green from where I was at.

Q.   Everybody was talking today about this pairing of you and Michelle.   What was that pairing like, to get so much hype for it and have so many people out here? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   It was great.   Playing with Michelle, it's always a lot of fun.   She bombs it, and she has a great personality, so it's a lot of fun out there.   We had amazing fans, such a huge amount of fans out there, so it's great to see just how much the game of golf is growing.
