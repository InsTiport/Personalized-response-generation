Q.   What happened out there this afternoon?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it was just an overall struggle the whole day.   Didn't really get anything going, struggled a bit with my irons again and didn't start off putting well.   But you know, today is another today.   So going into it with a positive attitude.

Q.   Can you take us through one and kind of what happened there with that putt?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I just‑‑ I missed a 3‑footer for par.

Q.   Did it rally throughout or just got it out of your head after that?
LEXI THOMPSON:   No.   I mean I got over it as quick as I could.   You're going to miss putts.   That's golf.

Q.   Is it encouraging at all to know that no one else has really made a lot of ground today.   Everyone just kind of stayed where they were yesterday?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it definitely does.   I needed to shoot a few under today to be in good position for tomorrow.   Unfortunately I'm six back now.
But you know, I'm just going to try to shoot as low as I can tomorrow.   I've got nothing to lose, so we'll see how it goes.

Q.   Knowing you can hit it further than most, do you feel like you still have a good shot at this?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I mean I'm six back, but that's nothing with golf.   You never know what can happen.   But I'm just going to go out there tomorrow with a positive attitude and try to do my best and try to shoot a low one like I did Thursday.
