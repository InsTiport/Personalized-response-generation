Q.   Feel pretty good after that round? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, yeah, I do.   I hit it really well today.   I still left a few putts out there, but it's golf.   So hopefully it will be better tomorrow.
Q.   Feel good going into tomorrow?   You're just 2 shots behind right now. 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I do.   I feel really good.   Hopefully I'll drop a few more putts, I guess.   I just have to take one shot at a time.
Q.   Is it you kind of play within yourself, and then kind of monitor where the scores are at the turn tomorrow?   And if need be, you get really aggressive and go for the pins?   How do you think your way through it?
  Yeah, obviously, focusing on one shot at a time and see what my opportunities are.   If there are a few tough pins, you play right to the middle of the green and take a 15‑, 20‑footer, and then go for the easy pins.
Q.   Lexi, has there been anything specific in your game that you've been working on that you feel like is coming to fruition this week? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   I would say just my consistency and my ball striking.   I've just been working on trusting my targets.   Picking out a target and just visualizing my shot.   That's what I've been doing every shot.   I think I've committed pretty good to them.
Q.   Do you leave today with just a hint of frustration?   You had a chance to take another stroke lower there and you were really close on that last pin. 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I mean, I had a chance on the hole before it too.   You know, I hit a good putt on the last hole, so I can't get too frustrated.   It was just a misread.   But you know, I'm going to hopefully drop some more tomorrow and hit it as well as I did today.
Q.   Did your eyes kind of light up when you see closing par‑5s on a hole and you get it back in the end? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, my eyes definitely light up.   I can get pretty close to number 17.   18, being a little bit more wet today, I was a good 50, 60 back.   But, yeah.   I mean, they're pretty easy birdie holes if I just get it in the fairway there.   So I definitely like that.
Q.   Your chip, do you have a distance to the front of the green just roughly, a good guess? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   Distance to the front?   I know I wanted to land it 40, and at the angle I was going it was probably around 35 to get on.
Q.   Did you in one of the first two rounds, did you hit that green in two there? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   I did.   I hit it on the back fringe.
Q.   Back fringe?   Do you remember that day?
  LEXI THOMPSON:   I think it was the first day.   I actually hit my drive to the end of the fairway and hit a pretty low 3‑wood running up there.
Q.   The only other person that we can even remember ever having a birdie or an eagle putt on this hole is Laura Davies.   Are you that kind of long? 
  LEXI THOMPSON:   I've played with Laura quite a few times.   I would say she still hits it farther than me, but it's all about placing it on the fairway.   If I get a 3‑wood turning over and get it to the end of the fairway and then hit through it up there, I can get it pretty good.   But, yeah, you just have to get it to the end.
