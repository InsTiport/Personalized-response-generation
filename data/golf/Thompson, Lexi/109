Q. Lexi, how is the course playing out there conditions-wise?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  Well, there wasn't too much wind being 7:07 tee time, there wasn't much wind to speak on a few the holes.  The greens were a little softer due to the morning.
The scores were definitely out there but still it's a U.S. Women's Open golf course.  It's definitely challenging if you don't hit the fairways.
Q. The greens, how are they playing?
LEXI THOMPSON: Softer.  With some of the pin locations if you leave yourself in the wrong spots you get some of the fastest putts out there.  I realized that on a few of my putts, barely tapped them and still went three feet by.  That's the golf course for you.
Q. 1-under, just like it's a good position to be in after the 1st Round?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely is.  I never am complaining with an under par round in the U.S. Women's Open.  I left a little ball-striking out there.
I'm very happy with the way I scrambled and made a few solid par gets.  Hit a few good spots in the second 9 and go into tomorrow with a positive attitude.
Q. Any advantage starting that early as far as weather or humidity?
LEXI THOMPSON: It was very hot even with how early we played, it was still very hot out there.  Definitely being the wind maybe and some of the weather that I think is coming in early afternoon but we'll see.  I love playing in the morning so we'll see what the weather brings for the next few days.
Q. Any particular part of the ball striking, was it off the tee that was bothering you?
LEXI THOMPSON: I would say off the tee.  I think I hit like four fairways.  I struggled a little bit off the tee but, like I said, I'm very happy with the way I scrambled and played my right shots into the greens knowing that they were going to come out a bit different out of the rough.
Thank you.
