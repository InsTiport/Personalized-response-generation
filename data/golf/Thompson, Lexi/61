Q. You're now 10-1-2, you guys are as partners.  What a turnaround today, after of course two days actually.  What was the momentum change for you guys early in this match?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, we got down very early, but I think the putt that she made on No. 7 for a birdie, just to get that little momentum going back our way, that's what we needed, and then we kick-started it from there, just fired at pins and just put a little pressure on them.
Q. Cristie, we know you bring out the best in her.  What does she do to bring out the best in you?
CRISTIE KERR: I mean, even when it was rough on the front nine, whatever day that was, she just encouraged me to keep trying and to not give up, and I did, I made that birdie on 7.  But I was riding the 6 Train today, baby.  That's the Lexington Avenue train to New York City.
