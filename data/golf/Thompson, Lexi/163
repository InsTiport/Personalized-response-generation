Q. Obviously you got to play a lot of holes out there.  What's it like for you?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was just an early wake-up call to play two holes and then wait around until 3:00 to warm back up.  But it is what it is, you can't control the weather, and I just tried to make the best of it on the holes that I did play.
Q. What did you do during that time frame to keep yourself right for the afternoon?
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, I went back and slept for an hour.  I wasted some time.  Just relaxed, and then I went through my whole warm-up stretching routine in the hotel room to get ready and then come out here mentally prepared.
Q. I can tell by your body language that you're not completely happy with the way things are going out there.  Can you talk about what's going on with your game?
LEXI THOMPSON: I wouldn't say I'm not happy.  During the six holes I played I was a little off with the putting, but I'm overall very pleased with how my ball-striking is.  I'm just very focused this week.  I want to play very well, and I've been ball-striking very well, just need a few more putts to drop for me, and we'll see.
Q. We talked earlier in the week about putting with the eyes closed.  Have you stuck with that?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I'm still putting every putt with my eyes closed.
