 Q.   Lexi, 69, solid start.   Run me through the round.   How many birdies, how many bogeys?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I had one bogey.  
   
 Q.   One bogey?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yep.  
   
 Q.   So very solid.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.   It was a pretty consistent day.   Could have dropped a few more putts coming in, but overall I played very solid, so I'm happy with it.  
   
 Q.   Everyone is saying the greens are a little tricky here.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Very undulated.   Is that something you not look forward to, but kind of thought about coming into in, knowing you have to do a lot of lag putts and all that good stuff?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, they are a little tricky.   They sometimes do something different than you see.   But, you know, really you have to focus on doing your same putting routine and see the ball go in the hole.  
But yeah, lag putting, just try to get it up there within three or four feet and make it.  
   
 Q.   All right.   Anything else that stuck out?   Got a little windier throughout the round.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Everyone is saying it swirled a little bit.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.   It definitely got windier on my second nine, and it swirls out here, for sure.   You have to look at the top of the trees to figure it out, because once you tucked in, it's doing the total opposite.  
   
 Q.   Anything that stuck out you wanted to tune up now afterward, improve on?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   You mean that I'll practice?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   I'll probably just hit a few putts.   I won't go to the range.   I hit it pretty solid.  
   
 Q.   Take it easy?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.   Take it easy.  
   
 Q.   All right.   What happened on the bogey?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I actually like three‑putted from like ten feet.   It was just a little bit faster than I thought, and I went for it.   Had like a four‑footer coming back and I missed it.   I played the hole well.   The hole, the greens can get away from me if they're downhill.
