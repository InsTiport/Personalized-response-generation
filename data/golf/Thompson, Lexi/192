Q.   Another impressive round for you today.   Take me through your round a little bit. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Overall it was a very steady round.   I mean, my back nine was a little shaky, missed a few putts here and there, but overall I struck it well off the tee and hit a few good iron shots, so just waiting for those putts to drop.

Q.   I heard you switched up your putting a little bit?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I did, a little bit, just a little bit at setup and then my path and my stroke, so it was definitely a big change for me, but it was a change that needed to be made, and I'm just getting used to it right now.

Q.   Starting to get comfortable a little bit?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it's all about being comfortable over the putts and being confident, but I knew something needed to be changed in my setup.   I've rolled a lot of good putts so far, so hopefully I'll continue that.

Q.   So that approach at No.18 was exactly the way you were trying to play, right?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I wouldn't say I was trying to nail the grandstand, but I was kind of pushing my hybrid to carry over on the right if I did mis‑hit it barely, so if I'm in the back bunker at least I'll have a chance at birdie.   But I was just trying to cut a 3‑wood in.   It was really solid.   I'm just happy it hit that grandstand and not somebody else out there.

Q.   It might have been up here because you hit it pretty hard. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I know, and then it went through the bunker apparently or something like that.

Q.   How far did you have on that shot?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I had 208 front and then like 224 pin, something like that.   Maybe a little less. 

Q.   How much differently did the course play as the round wore on?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Well, it's playing a lot differently just since Wednesday.   It's dried up so much.   I'm just amazed by it.   The wind definitely picked up today.   It was about I want to say 10 miles per hour, maybe a little bit more at times when it gusted, but it's definitely just playing a lot drier.   You have to be careful with some of those tee shots if you want to play aggressive.

Q.   So now tied for the lead what do you do heading into this final round?   Do you do a little putting, do a little practice or chill?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I'm definitely going to putt some, just do a few drills just to get that confidence going into tomorrow, but I'm not going to hit any balls, and then just relax the rest of the afternoon and maybe get a little workout in and just hang out with my family.

Q.   Are you confident with where your swing is and where everything is going into the final round?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I definitely am.   I'm feeling really comfortable off the tee and with my iron shots.   It's just all a matter of confidence out there.   You know, I struggled a bit last week, but the weather conditions were a bit different than this week. 
You know, I just came into this week not really expecting much, just going into every shot, doing my routine, and doing my breathing and everything. 

Q.   There are some players right behind you, and with the course playing the way it is there are some good scores out there.   What do you expect going into tomorrow, just a real shootout?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Well, yeah, the leaderboard is very stacked right now, so I'm expecting low scores, but really I'm just going to focus on my game and doing my routine on every shot, focus one shot at a time and not focus on anybody else.   All I can really care about is what I do out there, I can't control what they do.

Q.   We've talked so much about this young group of players out here like yourself and others, but you look at Karrie Webb, she was 21 and she was the youngest player on Tour, but she's 40 now and she's right in the mix.   What does it say when there's someone like that, a veteran in the mix?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Oh, it's awesome.   Everybody knows Karrie has so much game still, it's ridiculous how talented she is.   I've played with her quite a few times, and she's an amazing player, all‑around great game, Hall of Famer and everything.   Juli Inkster is in the mix, too, which is awesome to see.   Fans love that.   But it's all ages, and it's great to see in golf.

Q.   You mentioned chilling with your family, hanging with your family and stuff.   How do you like Texas?   Have you had a chance to taste the local fare or anything?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it's great to have my family here.   Both my parents are here with me this week, so it's great to have that support.   I haven't gotten to really experience the full Texas experience yet, just because I've had a lot of dinners to go to and outings.   Unfortunately not, but looking forward to just relaxing tonight.
