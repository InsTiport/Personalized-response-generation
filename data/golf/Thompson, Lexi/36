Q. Your 11th win on the LPGA Tour.  Congratulations to you.  I've just got to ask from where you dig down deep to finish it off today?  When you hit a couple of bumps with bogeys at 12 and 15, then you finish birdie, par, big eagle at 18.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I knew coming into the day that it was going to play very difficult, just because this golf course, it can get so windy, and as you saw, it's a lot of crosswinds and it was blowing probably 30 on some of those holes.  It was all a matter of just trusting my shots, trusting the lines, just letting the wind blow it back really.  The bogeys on the back nine, they weren't bad shots or anything or bad bogeys, so you just have to let them go because you know there's a few birdie holes coming in.
Q. Well, you were 11-under on the par-5s, 12-under for the tournament, so you took advantage of those holes.  Take us through that incredible shot at 18 which set up the eagle.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, honestly I have 190 to the front and probably, I guess, 200 to the pin, and I had a little jumper lie out of the rough.  I've gotten jumpers every time I've been in the rough, so I played for it, and everything bounces out so much in front of that green, so I played it to land 30 short and then with the wind taking 20 more off that, so I hit pitching wedge from 190 and just trusted it, I guess.
Q. Three beautiful shots.  Seems appropriate you get your 11th win here.  It was nine years ago we watched you in your pro debut at the ShopRite, so congratulations.
LEXI THOMPSON: Thank you.
