 Q.  Coming on to the back nine, double-bogey into a bogey, what were you saying to yourself before you approached No. 3?  
LEXI THOMPSON: 3 is definitely a birdie hole for sure, as long as I get a good drive down there.  Reachable par 5.  Unfortunately what I did on No. 1 and No. 2 -- No. 2 is playing very hard today with the straight crosswind.  So I knew it was possible to make a bogey on that hole, but I just tried to keep in it, fight strong through the rest of the nine, because I knew there was some birdie holes out there.   
 Q.  This was a tough afternoon with the wind.  How do you think you were able to deal with these kind of conditions?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It was really tough.  Today it was more of the conditions that I feel like this course usually plays with the wind and how windy it gets out here.  There's just so many crosswinds I feel like on some of the longer par 4s, which I feel like makes it a little bit tougher, and I believe the par 3 towards the end, it plays straight into the wind.  It's like a 4-iron.  It's a good hole, and that's what this course defends, the wind out there.  It definitely played difficult.  Just making pars out there were good, and making birdies on the reachable par 5s.   
 Q.  It's a tight leaderboard and anything can happen tomorrow.  What are you going to take away from today to go into tomorrow?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I'm just going to take away how I fought strong for my back nine after 1 and 2, obviously, and just how I stayed confident within myself and made those through birdies.  Made the eagle.  Just fought back and shot 1-under par.
