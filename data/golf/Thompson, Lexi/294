   ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I don't want to play in the dark.  I don't want to finish in the dark.  It gets hard to see. 

 Q.  How do you feel about how you played out there? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Well, I had a rough beginning, but I had a birdie and I had a couple pars.  I had a good par on number 17.  I kind of like shanked it.  But I made an awesome par.  So I'm happy. 

 Q.  What did you hit on the second shot at 17? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  It was a 7-wood.  Not too bad.  It wasn't a shank, I have a tendency to stand too near to the ball and so I didn't quite get all the way through it. 

 Q.  All in all, happy? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, pretty happy.  I'll just go tomorrow and try to make my pars, pars are good for this course, because it's so long. 

 Q.  Your dad said he was trying to get you to be more aggressive on the greens and you were a little tentative. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, well in the beginning I left a couple short, so he's like, you need to get these putts to the hole.  And I said, dad, I don't know these greens, they might double cut them or something, you never know.  And I was afraid I was going to knock it off the green or something. 

 Q.  Did you feel more comfortable with it as the round went on?  Did you feel like you had a feel for the greens a little bit? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, my, I know after my first few bogeys I think that I said I'm just, I'm going to make my pars, get up-and-down if I missed the green and yeah, that's hard to do on some of these greens. 

 Q.  Were there any nerves on the first tee or was that all behind you? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  On the first tee I was a little nervous.  But after that one I was all set. 

 Q.  It looked like after you were walking off the tee there at 10 you were trying to take some deep breaths. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, I knew I needed to do that to just keep it going. 

 Q.  But that one, you almost took your breath away, I guess, maybe? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah. 

 Q.  How did you handle the weather delay? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I just hung out in the locker room.  I played ping pong and pool with a couple friends.  And then sat down and just talked.  And then got going, hit balls. 

 Q.  Dad said you had a ball. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, it was pretty fun. 

 Q.  How disappointing maybe was it, you know, you had only played eight strokes when the horn went off.  Did you feel like, gee, I wish I could have been out here for a little longer? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, I did.  Just to get that hole over with, if anything, because I mean if it rains, you don't know what the putt's going to do, if it's going to be slower. 
 So I wish I would have just got the hole done. 

 Q.  Did you play ping pong with friends from home or other players? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  No, other players. 

 Q.  Do you know who? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Vicky Hurst, Tiffany Lua and Kimberly Kim. 

 Q.  Who won? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  (Laughter.)  In ping pong?  I won against Vicky first, but I don't know if she let me win, okay.  Don't make that sound like I'm some brat or something, but.  I don't know.  We just had fun.  I was watching them for the most part, so. 

 Q.  Any Coke's on the line or anything to keep it interesting? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Oh, no.  No.  We just played.  I just stood up so I could get blood flowing.  And I kept going down the stairs just to keep my energy going. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I think I got enough practice rounds where I would have felt good coming out here for the first day.  So I felt good coming out. 

 Q.  What was the highlight of the day? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  What was the highlight of the day?  I mean, I made that one birdie.  My drivers were really good today.  So that was good.  I got it down in the fairway.  I couldn't quite hit the greens, but. 

 Q.  What was it like hearing your name on the 10th tee when they got up there and introduced you and said Coral Springs, Florida, Lexie Thompson, what was that like? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  It was great, just hearing all the people cheering and I was a little nervous, but otherwise, it was okay. 

 Q.  You looked like you were having a lot of fun with this autograph thing. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I love it.  I love it. 

 Q.  Do you sign Alexis or do you sign Lexie? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Alexis.  Yeah. 

 Q.  What about last night were you nervous, have trouble going to sleep? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Oh, no.  I just watched TV, I mean, relaxed. 

 Q.  Any show in particular that you watched? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I watched Whose Line is It Anyway.  On like at 10. 

 Q.  What about playing 27 tomorrow? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I figured, just get nine in so it's not another sectional qualifier again.  I mean, it's still going to be wild, but at least we get a break in between, hopefully. 

 Q.  The birdie, what did you hit in there and what was the yardage? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Par-5, hit my drive, I had, I think I hit like a wedge, yeah, a wedge.  Yeah, it was a wedge.  And it was I think 115 or 14, right in there. 

 Q.  How long was the putt? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  It was like about probably 30 feet. 

 Q.  What's it like to make a birdie in the U.S. Open? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  It was great.  I mean, the par-5, it was a good chance for me.  It's not like I can really birdie the par-4s out here, I have to hit a wood in to those, you know, so.  But, yeah, it felt good.  I needed it. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I don't know.  That's kind of a weird question, but.  I make a lot of birdies.  I can't remember them all. 

 Q.  Did it bring some confidence or loosen you up? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, it was halfway through the round already but it made me feel better about the holes coming in.  Just par them and maybe a birdie would be great.  But I bogeyed.  Yeah.  I bogeyed that.
