Q. Lexi, I know you were a little frustrated out there at first, but you closed with a couple birdies and an eagle.  How much did that change your mindset heading into Sunday?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a quick change out there with my last few holes, but it was a bit of a struggle my first 10.  Just on the greens, struggled a bit, just putting a little timid, but to finish like that definitely turns around my confidence, and I feel really good going into tomorrow.
Q. How do you shore up the putting for Sunday?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I was a little off.  I thought the practice green was a lot faster today, and I got out there, and they were a little slower.  I was just a little timid, but putting is all about confidence, so I just need to roll a few in and get that confidence going.
Q. Is this about as well as you've ever hit it?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, since the season started this is probably the best I've hit it.  I've just really simplified things, just tried to tighten up my golf swing and hold my finish, commit to my lines, and really that's all I've been focusing on.
Q. This is obviously a golf course where you feel very comfortable.  How will you go control the nerves heading into the final round with the lead?
LEXI THOMPSON: Really just take it slowly tomorrow, focus on my own game.  That's really all I can control, have a positive attitude going into tomorrow, focus on my lines, doing my routine, and just have fun with my caddie in between shots.
