Q.   No need to remind you, Team USA, the only team without a point on day one.   Did you feel additional pressure leading on the first group off for your team today?
LEXI THOMPSON:   No, I didn't feel any additional pressure at all.   I think that put more fire into all of us coming into today.
We all came out here with a lot of heart and played our own games and tried to make birdies and we did that.
