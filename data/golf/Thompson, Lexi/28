 Q.  Thank you for coming to Japan again.  
LEXI THOMPSON: You're welcome.   
 Q.  How is your three days of the tournament?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was good. Overall, I hit it really well. Very happy with how I hit it. I just missed a lot of fairways by a yard or two. And then the first day I struggled putting, but then felt better over them the next two days.   
It's always a joy to come back to Japan. Wish I could have played a little bit better, but I still enjoyed it.   
 Q.  Before coming here you had four weeks off?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, four to five weeks off. Yeah, it was nice. I needed time to work on my game.   
 Q.  How is your new swing going?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It's going well. I feel very comfortable with it. Just a matter of I struggled for a few months with very errant tee shots.   
You know, it's back to getting my shot dispersion closer. It was great this week. I committed to my lines a lot more and played more aggressively, which is what I'm used to.   
So it was nice. It was just beautiful week.   
 Q.  All the fans really happy to see you again. Please come back next year.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, of course. I love my fans here. No worries.   
 Q.  While you were in Japan did you travel somewhere?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I didn't this week just because it was -- we were stuck here until probably 3:00 in the afternoon and I train after, so there is not too much time.   
Unfortunately, but golf is the main focus. (Laughter.)
