Q. Well, that would be a good start.
CRISTIE KERR: It was all me out there.
LEXI THOMPSON: She made par.
CRISTIE KERR: I just tried to knock it up there and give her the line.
Q. Thoughts standing over that putt?
LEXI THOMPSON: There was just a lot of adrenaline.  I made sure I took a lot of deep breaths before, with all the screaming going on before with Mel making that putt.  I knew I had to top her.  I had a good read on it.  I had a perfect spot to aim my putt and just had to commit.
Q. Crazy series of events since yesterday.  How much sleep did you get?
CRISTIE KERR: I got seven hours.
LEXI THOMPSON: Me, too.
Q. Quick turnaround, but warm up, did you expect the rain at all?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, they said it was going to rain.  It was pretty exciting.  I didn't hit a good tee shot, I hit it in the rough.  The only thing I can do is give her a good read.  I hit it literally right behind her and they had to give it to me.  So it was a good par.  I was trying to hit it right behind her.  That was a good shot.
Q. How huge is this?
CRISTIE KERR: It's huge momentum for us, because with them holing out and the dark, anything could have happened this morning.
Q. Did Juli give you guys any instruction or any encouragement?
CRISTIE KERR: Try to make birdie.
