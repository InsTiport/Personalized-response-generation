Q. I know you weren't real pleased with last week but had a good finish last week, and seems like a good start again this week.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, you know, I ended with a good round this week.  I just couldn't really get anything going.  But overall, been playing pretty steady.  Didn't hit it as well as I wanted to last week.  But yeah, shot 4-under today, so overall, pretty good round.  Got lapped out there with the 10-under.  But it was awesome to watch, that's for sure.
Q. And what about Sung Hyun, what did she end up shooting, 10-under?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, she shot 10-under, and I swear it seemed like she birdied every hole.  It was amazing to watch.  I've never seen her play before and she's a great player.  Amazing putter and great ball-striker, and she hits it long.  She out-drove me on every hole.
Q. How far?
LEXI THOMPSON: Me and Michelle.  Probably ten yards, ten, 15 yards, on a few of those holes.
Q. She's definitely shorter than you are, too.
LEXI THOMPSON: She gets it out there.  The few she missed, we out-drove her on, but she didn't miss many.
