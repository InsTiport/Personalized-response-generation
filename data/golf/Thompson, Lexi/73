Q. Great round today.  3-under.  How do you feel about it overall?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, felt pretty good.  Definitely could have struck it a little bit better.  Just a touch off hitting it solid-wise, but definitely never going to complain with 3-under par.
I rolled it well on the greens, so hopefully just have a good tomorrow.
Q. What's it like to see the LPGA come to a place like Hollywood and Wilshire Country Club?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's great to see.  Hopefully we get a lot more fans out here this weekend to watch us.  The course is in great shape for us.  Never seen it before, along with a lot of other people.  It's great to have another tournament in the States.
Q. Did you take last week off, I guess?
LEXI THOMPSON: Uh-huh.
Q. What did you do with your free time?
LEXI THOMPSON: I did.  I just spent it at home; spent time with my family and just worked on my game a lot.  You know, just practiced a lot and trained to get ready for this two-week swing here.
Q. So this is a position golf course.
LEXI THOMPSON: Uh-huh.
Q. How often are you hitting driver off the tee here, and is your length not helpful around here?
LEXI THOMPSON: My length is helpful on a few of the holes.  I definitely hit a lot of 3-woods on this golf course as well, which isn't bad.  Sometimes my 3-wood goes just as far as my driver.
It's all a matter of getting it in the fairways and staying out of the fairway bunkers.  The fairways bunkers have quite big lips on them.  So just keep it in the fairway and fire at the pins.
Q. What was your first impression of the course?  Did it suit you're eye?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  I mean, like I said, I do hit a good amount of drivers and 3-woods, so that's always good for me.
Yeah, like you said, it's a placement golf course, just getting in the fairways.  The greens are definitely a little bit softer, so it's all about controlling your spin into the green.
So it definitely suited my eye.  I like it.  Hopefully have a good next few days.
Q. Spend a little bit of time on putting last week?  Was that sort of a main focus?  Short game?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  I mean, I did.  I spent a few hours each day and definitely feel a lot better over the putter.  Yeah, golf is golf.  You have off weeks.  Some days you roll if really well and feel comfortable and there are spots you pick on the greens you want to aim at and roll it over, and some days it's not.
I definitely feel a lot more comfortable.
Q. So not really technique, just sort of feeling?
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, I changed a little thing that slipped my mind that I was working on earlier in the year.
I'm definitely rolling it a lot better.  There is more of a roll to my putts now.
Q. Can you share what that was that slipped your mind?
LEXI THOMPSON: No, because I don't want jinx it.
