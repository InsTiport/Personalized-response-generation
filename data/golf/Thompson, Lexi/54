 Q.  I know it's probably not the finish that you wanted, but you're still right there in it heading into the weekend.  Can you take us through your thoughts on how today went for you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a really hard day, not only with the wind, but some of the pin locations I don't think they really thought through with the extreme winds and crosswinds that they had coming in.   
But I hit some great shots coming in.  Just misclubbed on 8.  It was flagged, but I hit it very solid today, so still a lot of positives to take from the day going into the weekend.   
 Q.  Talking about those pin locations, was that something you knew going into today's round, or something that kind of caught you off guard as you went?  
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, coming into the week I always expect hard pin locations with a major.  I think they should have been a little bit more reasonable with the crosswinds.  I'm good with it playing tough.  Just usually there is a line with the crosswinds, and especially when they get to 20 like it did today.   
 Q.  What are you looking forward going into the weekend?  Still in a great position.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Just looking forward to playing this weekend.  My game is in a good spot.  I love the golf course.  I know we're supposed to get good weather.  Maybe just wind pick up like it did today.  I'm looking forward to playing.  It's a great golf course and just a good week in general.
