   DANA GROSS-RHODE: All right, everyone, thank you for joining us. We have with us Alexis Thompson who's an amateur, but you just carded a 7-under par 65 at the Navistar LPGA Classic. Talk about your round today. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, everything was working for me. I mean, my ball striking was good. I mean, my driver was a little off, but, I mean, I'm not gonna complain. I rolled my putter really good, so... 

DANA GROSS-RHODE: What were some of the highlight holes? When was the last time you fired a 7-under on a course? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I haven't. 

 DANA GROSS-RHODE: So this was a career-low for you then. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, my lowest is 66 until today.

 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Where did you card that? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I think it was the Westfield two years ago. I think I might have done it that same tournament this year. I don't know. I don't remember.

 Q. You seem more nervous now than when you were on the course ... 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No, I'm just happy. I mean, the golf course is in really great shape. I mean, the greens are really fast. I got some really fast putts out there that I had to barely tap, but the golf course is great. I'm just honored to be here.

 Q. When you putted out on nine, there was someone who gave you a high five and, it sounded like he said, 'A star is born.' Is that right?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah. It was a caddie. I forget which one. I got a really good group today. They're all super nice. I mean, couldn't have been a better group.

 Q. Going into tomorrow, same group again just different tee. Does that give you confidence so you can relax for tomorrow? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, knowing I have the same people, they're super nice people. It's just another day. I'm just gonna hopefully continue on what I did today into tomorrow. 

 Q. To be 14 and accomplish what you have at this age, do you think it's tough for people to relate to, sometimes?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Um, you know, I don't know. I started really young, so, I mean, I'm just really dedicated to what I do. I'm homeschooled. 
 I practice about seven, eight hours a day. I mean, I just try to do my best out here. If I don't, I mean, it's one tournament. You can't do anything about it.

 Q. What do you like to do in your spare time?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Probably go to the movies and just hang out with friends. Normal things. 

 Q. Do you have any who can shoot a 7-under?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I have a few. Yeah. (smiling) 

 Q. What's it been like with the junior Solheim Cup, and then with the fall starting and now playing this schedule. Talk about the Solheim Cup and then... 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, Solheim Cup was amazing. I mean, I had a great team, and I mean, it was so much fun. Then when I got to play with the real Solheim Cup and with Nancy Lopez, I can't even explain that. She made it like a million times better. She's the best captain. She was awesome.
 I mean, I've just been practicing a lot for this tournament -- for the qualifier, I mean. (Laughter.) I didn't know I was in it. 
 I just practiced up for the qualifier. I mean, this is a last-minute thing that we decided, and it worked. 

 Q. Are you going to college or what are your career plans?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I have no clue. I mean, I'm in ninth grade. I'm gonna take one grade at a time. I mean, I'm just taking one year at a time. 

 Q. So this is a last-minute decision?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Uh-huh.

 Q. Why?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I haven't played for a while after Solheim. So like a week before, my dad was like, You want to go and try to qualify for this event? I was like, Yeah, sure. Why not? I might as well get some competition play out of it and get me ready for my other events coming up after.

 Q. If you weren't here, what would you be doing?
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Probably practicing a lot more for my junior event next week, the PING Invitational. 

 Q. (no microphone)
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, definitely.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you very much. Congratulations on a great round today.
