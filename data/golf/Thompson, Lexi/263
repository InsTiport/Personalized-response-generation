Q.   So how do you feel about the round?
ALEXIS THOMPSON:   I feel pretty good.   I hit it really well.   It's just I struggled with my putter until the 16th hole, then I figured something out, so went well for the last three.

Q.   So even though you're a few shots off, how do you look at the rest of the tournament?   Do you feel kind of like now you've started to figure things out and tomorrow will be better or how do you come off?   Are you frustrated or what's your mindset?
ALEXIS THOMPSON:   No.   I feel good.   I mean I hit it well; just putts didn't drop. 
So I'll work on my putting for a little bit, what I was working on for the last three holes and go out strong tomorrow and the next three days.
