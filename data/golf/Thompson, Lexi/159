Q. Birdie at the last has to feel very nice, a bit of a frustrating day?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it wasn't as solid, obviously, as yesterday.  I hit a lot of good, solid iron shots, but probably just didn't aim at pins like I did yesterday and getting it to them as well.
Q. How long was the putt on 18, five feet?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, five, six feet.
Q. What happened on 17?
LEXI THOMPSON: I hit a pitching wedge just right of the green, and it hit like on the downslope and went over to the rough.  I tried to hit like a high flop and came up short and then putted it on and made bogey.
Q. You guys are all kind of neck-and-neck the whole day; were you feeding off each other at all?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, well, there wasn't too many birdies being made in the group.  Amy and Q, they both struck it very well, played consistent, but we just didn't get that many birdies, so it wasn't the most exciting bunch, but it was great to play with them.  Great ball strikers, obviously, good putters.
Q. Not as many low scores today.  Was it windier, pin positions, anything?
LEXI THOMPSON: It's just pin positions, and the ridges on these greens, you can get some tough pins, especially with how fast the greens are, so you have to make sure you hit the fairways and get the spin that you need going into the greens.  But it's a tough course, especially with the fast greens.  There's a lot of run-ups and a lot of ridges.
Q. Still in very good position; feel pleased?  Going to work on anything?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I'm not going to practice now.  It's been a long day.  I've been up since 5:00.  Yeah, it's been a long day.  A lot of positives to take from today.  I hit it great off the tee, so just going to go into the weekend with a positive attitude and see where it goes.
Q. I want to ask you about the top American ranking and that's up for grabs this weekend and you're in position to possibly get there.  I know you talk about going to No. 1, but passing Stacy would be a step in the right direction.  How big of an honor would that be?  Is that something that's on your mind at all?
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, it's not really on my mind, obviously.  This tournament is just on my mind right now.  My No. 1 goal going into this week was to win, but being the top American in the world is a big deal.  But I'm just going to play my game and just try to do my best.  If it happens, it happens.
