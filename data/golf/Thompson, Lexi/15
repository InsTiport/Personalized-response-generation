  THE MODERATOR:   We're here with Lexi Thompson after an even-par round.  It was a little chilly out there this morning, pretty breezy but you're still within contention after the first round.  What are your thoughts on Aronimink, one of the longer players in the field, and this course is a beast.
 LEXI THOMPSON:   It is definitely a beast of a golf course but it's in perfect shape.  It's definitely one of the best golf courses that we play, I believe.  It was playing long and I wasn't expecting it to be that windy.  My thing said 6 miles per hour and I was like, this is a strong 6.  But it's playing difficult, which I think all major championships should.
 THE MODERATOR:   Tell me how you feel right now coming off the course.  It was an up-and-down round unfortunately to close the round, but as I told Inbee before you who finished at even, you can't win it on the first day but you can certainly put yourself out of contention.  You're right in there.
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Well, thank you.  Unfortunate finish on the last hole but overall played well today so taking a lot of the positives out of the round.  It's important to just par a lot of the holes out there and take advantage of the few birdie opportunities that you do have.
 Q. What's the experience been like out here?  It still feels like a major.  I think they've done a great job of making it feel like a major even though it's not a lot of people on property.
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, they did an amazing job with it.  KPMG and the PGA of America do amazing with this event, just with making us feel special and having the whole major championship atmosphere, even though there is no fans.  We still feel like we're playing a major.
 Q. In regards to the greens, a lot of people talk about the length of the golf course.  How challenging are the greens out there?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   The greens are very challenging.  They're big greens but there's a lot of slopes in them and you just have to make sure you're on the right side of the hole.  There's going to be a lot of lag putts during every single round, but you just want to make sure you usually keep it below the hole.  That's the most important thing out there.
 Q. I heard you say you were going to go practice.  Anything in particular you're going to work on?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   I'm just going to hit a few putts and then just go to the range and hit a few irons and drivers.  My last few shots weren't the best.  Just give me a little confidence to sleep at night and going into tomorrow.
