Q. Been kind enough to spend a little time with us after another round of even par.  Eight back of the lead.  On a course like this playing so difficult, does that feel reasonable?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.  I mean, I think it's reasonable.  We have two more days.  The course is gettable.  You just have to drive it well.
It all depends on the wind, too.  Yesterday I felt was a lot more windy than today.  Just have to take advantage of the few birdie holes out there, fire at those pins.
Q. Yeah.  A lot of the girls are saying this is a ball- striker's golf course, and really will reveal those who are faking it and this who are hitting it well.  Your dad says you're hitting it as well as you can.  What would be the game plan?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Continue to hit it that well hopefully the next two days, and just make some more putts.  Just missing a few too many out there.  But I'm giving myself the opportunities, so if I keep on doing that, they'll fall eventually.
Q. Curtis on the bag.  You guys are comfortable together.  We picked up on a lot of the conversation today and the rapport is good.  The question I have:  As you try and decide on a permanent caddie in the future, what is important from a caddie standpoint to you?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I think it's the most important thing out here, the caddie-player relationship for me.  I depend on my caddie a lot.  I don't carry a yardage book.  I don't do anything.  I literally get up to my ball, how far do I have, and hit my shot.
So I have a lot of trust in my caddie.  But as well like I want that person by my side to be my best friend and listen to me vent, because I'm a venter when it goes bad.
So just somebody to be there for me, but as well have the numbers down for me as well.  So a lot of trust.  I think that's important for caddie-player relationship out here.
