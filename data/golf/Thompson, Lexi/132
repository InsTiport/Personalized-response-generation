Q. 66 today, I'm sure it was a good way to finish off kind of a tough week, but I'm sure you leave here a little happier than certainly you were the last couple of days?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely. I struggled a bit the last three days. Hit it a lot better today. Could have shot a lot lower, but I wanted to end on a good round. But just being here was an amazing experience, so definitely got to take the positive from that.

Q. Off the golf course, what's been kind of highlights for you? 
LEXI THOMPSON: Highlights, watching Usain Bolt win and then watched men's diving yesterday. It was just great to go to the village and see all the best athletes in the world and just be sure surrounded by them. It was a great feeling for me just to be there.

Q. In terms of 2020, obviously four years away and a lot of golf to accomplish before that, but is that on your list of things in the next couple of years to look forward to?
LEXI THOMPSON: Oh, definitely. 2020 I want to be there representing my country there in Tokyo. Any time I can represent my country, that's my No. 1 goal, to wear my colours.
