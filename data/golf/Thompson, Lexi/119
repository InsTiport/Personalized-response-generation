Q. Another great round.  This golf course really seems to suit you.  How do you feel going into the last day?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I feel good.  I played very well today.  Pretty solid, just was all over the lips today on the greens.
But I put some good strokes on a lot of my putts, so that's all that matters.  Hopefully bring that into tomorrow.
Q. What is your mindset being out front going into the final day?
LEXI THOMPSON: Same mindset as the last three days.  All I'm focusing on is my own game and sticking to my routine and committing to my lines off the tees and just having fun with my caddie in between shots.
Q. What did you hit into 15?  Yardage?
LEXI THOMPSON: 15, par-5.  I had 179 front, 96 pin; I hit a 6-iron.
Q. Is there a particular key to your success today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Not really a key, just same mindset as the last two days:  picking small targets off the tees and committing to my shots.  That's all I've been doing.
And just being relaxed and knowing that I've been playing well and just being confident.
Q. A lot of putts missed on the low side today.  Did that have to do with the fact that the greens were faster than they have been previously?
LEXI THOMPSON: I would say they actually might have been a little bit slower.  But they're rolling so good.  It was just a matter of two more rolls out of my some of my putts out there and I would've made 'em.  That's golf, I guess.
Q. Do you feel like you might have a sense of redemption tomorrow if you're able to win this?
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, I'm as determined as any other person out here.  We all want to win.  I have a little bit more drive now I would say, but I'm just going to go out there and be confident and see where it goes.
Q. Has that drive been with you all week or now that you're in contention you feel it even more?
LEXI THOMPSON: I've always been such a driven person that every time I tee it up I want to win.  I love this golf course and this venue, so I always feel comfortable coming here.
You know, see what tomorrow brings.
Q. You're always such a fan favorite.  What does having all these spectators out supporting you and all the players mean for and you everyone else out here?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's truly amazing just to see the amount of fans out.  And little kids.  That's what we really want to see.  Just hearing them cheer us on, it's the best feeling.  The fans make the game.
Q. (Regarding tee time tomorrow.)
LEXI THOMPSON: No, I want to make my tee time.  Don't need to be late.
Q. Are you still working with Kevin Kirk, and how much has he helped with your ball striking?
LEXI THOMPSON: I haven't worked with him since the lesson before the Shootout.  We still keep in contact and I send him swing videos here and there and he's always there to help me.
He's a great guy and great instructor?
Q. How do you sleep on a lead looking into tomorrow?
LEXI THOMPSON: You know, I sleep well.  Stay up as late as I can because I'm sure it'll be a late tee time once again.  Just hang out with my mom.  Get a home-cooked meal.
