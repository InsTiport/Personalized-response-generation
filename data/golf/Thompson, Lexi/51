Q. Way to finish the week off in Singapore, a couple eagles, hole-in-one.  Can you take us through some of those key holes today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I finally decided to hit the fairway, the last day of Singapore.  It's a tough golf course, and you definitely can't play it from the rough, which I was doing the first three days.  Made a lot of bogeys and others.
Today went really well.  I was 5-under through seven holes.  Made an eagle on a drivable hole and made a birdie on a par 5 after that, and made a birdie after that on the par 5, and made a few bogeys on the back but the hole-in-one definitely helped there on No. 7 with a 7-iron.  Helped me get back into it and just parred the last few holes.
Very happy with the way I hit it today.  A lot more promising than the first few days and last week.  Just a lot more to work on the three weeks that I have off.
Q. What specifically will you work on?  What are a couple things?
LEXI THOMPSON: Really just my ball-striking.  These two weeks, usually it's my strength, and then it was my weakness these two weeks.  What I worked on today -- it's all timing for me.  As everybody knows, I swing fast and get off the ground, so it's more just figuring out my weight transition and getting everything timed up properly.
