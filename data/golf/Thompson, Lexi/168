Q. How satisfying is it for to you come to another country and to take away a trophy?
LEXI THOMPSON: It's very satisfying.  I always look forward to coming back to South Korea and playing in front of these amazing fans, and I love Sky 72.  It's a great golf course.  I always look forward to it, but getting a win, it means so much.
Q. Everybody watching can't help but notice how well you drove the ball this week.  Is that a huge factor in your game these days?
LEXI THOMPSON: I think it helped this week, for sure.  The rough was up really thick so when I hit it in there, it was like a chip-out, basically.  So it definitely helped driving it well, helped me out a bit.
Q. Your short game was particularly good this week.  How satisfying is that for you to be able to get the job done as well with a wedge?
LEXI THOMPSON: It definitely helped.  I hit some good flop shot out of the rough today which helped me out quite a bit in today's round.  That's good.  That's what I've been working on, my short game, my chipping and my putting in the off-season, trying to improve upon that.
