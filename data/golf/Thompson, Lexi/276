   BETHAN CUTLER: Welcome to the OMEGA Dubai Ladies Masters. How much have you enjoyed Dubai so far.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I have enjoyed it a lot. I arrived I think Sunday, so I did a practise yesterday and the course is nice and excited to play the Pro-Am and get the tournament going.  
 BETHAN CUTLER: So what's your ambition here this week?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I just want to play well and my goal, Top-5 maybe, I'm just going to take it one day at a time though, don't get ahead of yourself, just try and do myself.  
 BETHAN CUTLER: You've had a really successful season even though you've only played a few tournaments. What's been the highlight for you?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Probably the Evian Masters and The Open. Those are two great events and just the people there were amazing, so nice, just like here, and you know, just want to do the same thing here.   
  
  Q. You've made phenomenal progress, are you surprised by that?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Not really. I've worked really hard to make this progress and to practise a lot, like seven hours a day. So just going to keep on doing that. Hopefully just keep on getting better and better.  
  
  Q. And how far do you think you can go in your career?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I think I can go pretty far but I'm not going to get ahead of myself. I'm just going to take it one tournament at a time and see where it takes many he.  
  
  Q. Are you excited as being regarded as the next great prospect in the game?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's definitely a good thing. I like that. But I've worked really hard and I think I deserve it.   
 BETHAN CUTLER: You're very popular in America, so how do you keep your feet grounded and what do you like to do in your off time.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I love hanging out with my family and having family time at home and hanging out with friends and just having fun and hanging out.  
 BETHAN CUTLER: Have you had a chance to do anything in Dubai besides playing golf?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: We went to Emirates Mall last night. We might go skiing but I have to watch, just look around, it's an amazing place. It's really pretty here.   
  
  Q. How did you get started in golf; did your family play?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: My parents played a little bit. My mom doesn't play at all a little bit more but my brother does play. I have a 27-year-old brother that plays on the PGA Tour and one that's going to LSU on a golf scholarship and they pretty much got me started. When I started at five they were pretty much into it so it just grew into me.   
  
  Q. How did the idea to turn pro come about --  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well pretty much my decision. I just thought it would be a great idea. I thought my game was ready and I just wanted to take my game to the next level.   
  
  Q. Is there a sibling rivalry in the Thompson family?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Oh, yeah, there definitely is. When we are all home we do these really intense competitions, and we do them for money or chores or stuff like that. It gets intense. Usually one of us quits by the midway; if we are losing, one of us will just quit and be like, like, oh, we are going to hit balls.   
  
  Q. Do you have success in those family tournaments?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I have a few wins. We like to get into it because we have a big money competition going and I'm just not in those. So I do that in it competition and just playing in tournament mode.   
  
  Q. Can you be a match for your brothers on the golf course?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, and sometimes I'll actually go all the way back to where they play out at the gold, so that way, it's a little fairer for them to win, but you know, I like to be -- just trying to hit it as far as them, that's why I hit it as far but it's fun.  
  
  Q. What's your 27-year-old brother's first name?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Nicholas.   
  
  Q. Who do you fancy between the two ladies to get the win on The Race to Dubai between Pace and Laura Davies?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: You know, they are both great players. I've played with Lee-Anne and they are both really nice. I don't really know who is going to win but they are both great players so it's definitely going to be close.  
  
  Q. Your thoughts on the golf course?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: It's really great, it's so pretty, the golf course is in amazing shape, and really looking forward to playing in Dubai.  
  
  Q. What have you done?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I've only gone to Emirate Mall but I'm going to do some more stuff.  
  
  Q. Your family and brother, do you think that having family in America and all over the world in golf has influenced you to where you are today?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it has influenced me, just growing up with them and they are already influenced with golf and it just grew on me and like other families that have a parent or a sibling that plays a sport, it definitely grows on you.  
  
  Q. Do you find it hard to deal with the fans in America --  
ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's pretty easy. I love hanging out with my fans. I don't have that much media going on, just at tournaments, I don't mind it so it's a lot of fun.  
 I went to Homecoming a few weeks ago, so that was good. I still hang out with my friends when I am not playing and watch movies, bowling, anything like that.  
  
  Q. Who is your favorite role model in the male and female category?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: In the women's category, probably Nancy Lopez. I've always looked up to her and she was the captain on the Solheim Cup team and that was a great experience for me. And on the men's side, I would probably have to say my brother, I've always looked up to him and always tried to follow in his footsteps.  
  
  Q. With your dad as your caddie, how is it having your family with you wherever you go, travelling all of the time, would it make a difference if your dad was not with you all of the time?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: My dad isn't with me but my agents are and they are pretty much like family. It's great to have my dad around, he usually caddies for me. I love having my family supporting me. When i went through the decision of going pro, they were just very supportive and they have been great for me.  
 BETHAN CUTLER: Thanks for joining us and best of luck this week.
