Q. Nice bogey-free, 8-under, 64.  Pretty good way to cap a long, hot week.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely was.  Overall played very solid the whole week.  Just had fun out there with Kevin.  Yeah, it was a good week.
I knew I had to just fire at everything today and make a lot of birdies, because Jessica has been playing amazing, along with a lot of other people.  So that's what I did:  I just went after it.
Q. Leads me to my next question.  8-under, 64 is nothing to blink at, but that shows how everyone is playing lights out here.  Was it the scoring conditions?  The weather?  What was it that you think led to the low scores this week?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I think there is not much wind here, but if you can get through the heat problem and just make sure you stay hydrated and get through the days, it's definitely scoring conditions.
Course is in perfect shape.  Greens are rolling unbelievably, and when there is no wind you can just fire at pins and just trust your shots a lot easier.
Q. Uh-huh.  What does this say about Jess' play?
LEXI THOMPSON: I don't think any of us doubt how talented Jessica is.  I think it shows coming out after surgery and that few-month break she had how much talent she actually has.  She's a player to always look out for.
