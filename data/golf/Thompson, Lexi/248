 Q. A lot of pars today, but the ones that weren't pars were pretty memorable, weren't they?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I made a pretty good run at it mid‑back nine with a hole‑in‑one and then I ended on two birdies.   It was just a little late for me.   But it was the best feeling ever getting that hole‑in‑one.  
   
 Q.   Walk me through that.   What was it like?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   That was amazing.   I can't describe the feeling in words.   It was 179 to the hole.   I hit just a little backed off 6‑iron and it just kept on rolling, rolling, and just disappeared.   So I dropped my club and I just went crazy.   It's the best feeling just to hear the crowd cheering.   I went up the line just high‑fiving everybody.   It was awesome.  
   
 Q.   Was that your first one?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   No, it was my fourth.   First in competition.   
   
 Q.   There was some question about they had to run and find the insurance contract because they were saying, Wait a minute, it's only one car.   Then they found out it was as many asneeded, so you're good.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Good.   
   
 Q.   Talk about being the witness to a pretty good duel today.   You played well yourself, but it was really a battle between those two.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, Paula and Beatriz played really good today.   It was great to watch.   Unfortunately I didn't make a move on the front nine and I think I had to to get a good start.   
Yeah, it was really awesome to be in the last group, and I'm very glad I put myself in that contention.   Overall just taking positives out of this week.
