  Q:   It was an up-and-down round for you, but you also only missed one green. What is your biggest takeaway from today?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   It was definitely an up-and-down day. Got off to a good start on the front nine with three birdies in my first five holes. Just struggled a bit with the putter on the back nine. Gave myself a bunch of good looks. Hitting it well. Just need to keep giving myself chances and I will have a chance tomorrow.
 Q:   What would getting another major victory mean to you?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   It would mean the world to me to win another major, especially on this golf course as it's one of my favorites we play all year. Just going to go out tomorrow and keep hitting good shots and hopefully a few more putts will fall on the back nine.
