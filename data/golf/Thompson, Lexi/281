  Q. The stats say 10 and 1 were the toughest holes. Why, and were they especially tough for you?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: One is tough because the green, for sure. I made it really tough just because I couldn't hit the fairway.  
 10, the green. Just everything runs off to the left and goes straight to the rough. They were just both really hard starting holes, because you started on either of them.   
  
  Q. How much did the lower scores add to the intensity today, the scoreboard watching a little bit, that sort of thing?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I was definitely surprised to see so many red numbers. But I don't know why it played so easy. Maybe some of tees -- they moved some of tees up and some of pins were pretty easy.   
 Some are really hard, too. So I don't know. Just great players. Got to expect that.   
  
  Q. Alexis, there was lot of talk earlier about how difficult the course might be and some of the players thinking it it's maybe too much. Do the scores today and Paula's performance kind of justify that, hey, you guys can play this golf course?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, she definitely showed that it can be done out here. If your game is on and you're hitting your driver and fairways, your irons good and putting good, you can hit low out here. I mean, not like low, low, but a few under.  
 That's what I tried to do, but I never pulled it off -- except for yesterday.  
  
  Q. Do you think it's just a matter of your putting catching up to your ball-striking skills?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Um, you know, my ball-striking was really good today. My putting didn't really wear off my ball-striking. It was just -- I have no idea. I've never really putted that bad.   
 But when I come home, I'm gonna putt 24/7. I'm figuring it out.   
  
  Q. What happened on the 9th tee shot?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Um, well, I don't know. I just hit it good up the right side with a little draw and it went pretty far. I had 7-iron in.  
  
  Q. What did you score?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I made birdie on that hole, so...  
  
  Q. Just because you were mad from bad putting?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I don't even know. I have no idea. I just hit the good.  
  
  Q. What's it like to have played four of these championships at 15?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's great. I love this tournament. So many people come out to watch it, so many fans. It's a great field, obviously. The best in the world. It's a great crowd and a great tournament to be at.   
  
  Q. You didn't think the pressure would affect you. Do you think that had any affect on you today?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Um, not really. I mean, it was just first-hole nerves. I don't know what I'm doing on the first hole. But once I get through that, it was fine, except for my last hole. On the last hole, that little slide over three-footer, I was shaking on that one.   
 But it was a great experience, so I wasn't that nervous.  
  
  Q. What do you take out of it for your next tournament?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: You know, I just take out of it that I have to work on my putting. Seeing all the other players I played with, their putt is just so good. They're always around the hole; great speed. That's something I have to work on.   
 If I just keep any ball-striking the way it was today and yesterday, I think I'll be good to go.
