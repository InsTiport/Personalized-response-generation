LEXI THOMPSON: That was the weirdest round of golf I've ever played.  Front nine I don't think I was awake.  And the back nine I just played lights out.  Being 4-down or 3-down going into the back nine, I was just, like, I just have to go all in and go for it all.   
And that's what I did.  And then I think I shot 6-under total, 2-over on my front, and what you said, 8-under on my back.  So, it was just a crazy round.   
Anna played great.  I knew it was going to be a good match.  I'm just happy I played the way I did on the back nine and felt strong.   
 Q.  You had a conversation with Nancy Lopez and a long conversation with Juli.  What did they say?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It helped me out a lot.  I struggled with my first few holes.  I don't really know what was going on.  Having them there for me, picking me up, just telling me to keep my head up and that I'm the best, and I can do this.  And I can come back and make six birdies, seven birdies in a row.  It means the world to me to have them there for me.  And that's what this event is all about, to have captains and assistant captains like that.   
I'm very proud of myself.  I had a really bad front nine.  I was 2-over and I was just struggling.  And having Nancy (indiscernible) cheering me up and telling me to keep my head up.  I just went for it all on the back nine.  I knew it was going to be a hard match (indiscernible).  Anna is an amazing player, and I knew I had to play strong on the back nine to get a half a point, and that's what I did.   
 Q.  How special was it to lead out Team USA today in the singles?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, it's great.  Just to be here in general, it's a huge honor to represent my country.  But to be first off, first match, it means a lot.  I wanted to win that full point, but struggled a bit.  But I fought strong for my country.  That's all I could do.
