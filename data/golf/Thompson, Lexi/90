Q. How important was it for you to get some rest last week after such an exhilarating and exhausting week?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was very important.  I took about four, five days off and just didn't touch a club.  I made sure I trained and kept in it.
Yeah, very important to relax, especially after that kind of week.  It's intense and mentally draining.  I needed those few days to come into these three-week stretch.
Q. No surprise to see your name climbing the leaderboard.  I got to go back to the Solheim Cup.  Interviewed you right afterwards.  Having a week to look back on it, what happened early an how were you able to play that kind of golf down the stretch?
LEXI THOMPSON: I don't know what happened early honestly.  My warmup up went really well.  I felt good going into the day.  I played like I was still sleeping on the first nine.
Being 4-down through nine, I just went all in on the back nine.  Kevin was pumping me up and saying, Let's just go at every pin and just try to birdie every hole.
I played really well on the back nine.  That was more how I was expecting to come into the day.  It was a great day, great finish to the Solheim Cup.
The Europeans played great, so huge honor to be there and finish it off like that.
Q. This is the type of course that a lot of people think is a ball-strikers paradise.  What do you have to do to find yourself atop the leaderboard Sunday?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely a ball-striker's golf course.  I have a good amount of wedges out there, but the greens get so firm.  It's important to get the landing yardage right so it stays pin high and not bounce over the green.
Because in the afternoon they were bouncing out a good eight to ten with wedges.  So it's very important.  The course is in great shape for us, so looking forward to playing in the morning tomorrow so I don't have to play for so much bounce-out.
