Q.   72 seems like a pretty good score today.   Is that something you're happy with?
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.   I'm very happy with it.   It was a little windier today and some harder pin placements.   Just had one bad hole, but I'll take it for sure.

Q.   You said some harder pin placements.   Compare the course today versus how it was the first two rounds. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, just a few holes they tucked a few more pins, but today I think it got up to 10 to 15‑mile‑per‑hour winds.   It got pretty gusty.   The other days it wasn't blowing that much.

Q.   What do you think about the way Na Yeon is playing today?   Have you played with her that much?
LEXI THOMPSON:   No.   I don't think I've ever actually played with her, but 7‑under at an Open is pretty good I would say.   So she's leading by a good amount, but I'm still going to go for it.

Q.   I was going to say, what's your mindset like with someone with that kind of a margin?
LEXI THOMPSON:   I'm not going to just try to go after her.   I'm going to play my own game and the golf course.   That's all I can do is focus on my game and nobody else's.

Q.   With so few rounds being under par today, hers seems to be the anomaly.   How do you get in your mind I'm going to have to go low.   I know you don't want to look at here, but you're going to have to get a pretty low number and there don't seem to be many out there. 
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah.   You know, you just have to take the easier holes and try to make birdies there, but pars and birdies are good out here.   Just gotta make your worst score a bogey.

Q.   What's your mindset going to bed at night and waking up tomorrow and knowing where you are on the leaderboard.   What has prepared you for this moment to chase a U.S. Open championship? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   I'm not going to have any different mindset, just go in tomorrow with the same attitude, confidence and trust my shots out here and play the way I have been.

Q.   Talk about 9.   You were on a roll coming into 9.   You had to wait a long time for the second shot.   Does that get your rhythm in trouble?
LEXI THOMPSON:   On 9 I actually hit a really good shot into the green.   It just ended up running through and chipped up to about six, seven feet, but didn't end up making it.   It wasn't really that bad of a bogey, so I wasn't too upset with it, so I just moved on.
