 Q.  What was today like for you? You've had some awesome playing partners the past couple of days. How do you feel about closing out the way you did?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Just this week in general is pretty amazing just to be surrounded by some of the best athletes and actors and just celebrities. It's a very fun week. At the same time, we want to play well, and we're grinding.   
But I played well, good start to the year. Definitely left a lot out there, but it's a good start. So I'm going to keep it going.   
 Q.  What is something about this round that you'll take with you going into Boca, around where you're from?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I think overall just taking from this week that my game's in the right direction. I worked hard in the off-season in making a few changes. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done, but it's a good start. Just going to try to keep it going.   
 Q.  Is it exciting to be starting a new event there in Boca, to be able to play with a hometown advantage for you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it is. Being able to stay in my own bed, I've never done that and played in a golf tournament. So it will be different. I've only played the golf course twice. So I don't know it great, but I have a few more practice rounds coming up. It's a great track. So just looking forward to playing.
