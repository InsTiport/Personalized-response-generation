 Q.   First of all, let's just go back a day or two.   What did it feel like coming back to Dubai and how were you feeling about your game when you arrived?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Felt great to come back to Dubai.   Been looking forward to this event for a few months now.   Brought back great memories walking up the 18th green and all.   I practiced really hard coming into this event because I wanted to defend.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel that your game has moved on in the last year, you're obviously very young; has it developed much in that time?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   It definitely has, I worked on a lot of things, a lot of short game practice, so just trying to tighten up my game and focus on spots that needed to be worked on.  
   
 Q.   Are you relatively pleased with the score today?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I am.   I could have dropped a few more putts, I had a lot of lip‑outs out there but 3‑under through the first round, I'll take it.   So stay around there, shoot a few more, I think I'll be in good position.   
   
 Q.   How do you approach tomorrow?   Are there specific things that you would like to do better out there than you did this afternoon?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Just see a few more putts drop probably.   I had some good strokes out there and that's all you can do, just unlucky sometimes.   Hopefully a few of them drop.   
   
 Q.   Happy with the start?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I am.   I didn't drop as many putts as I wanted to, like I said, but I hit a few squirrely tee shots, but that happens.     It's golf.   
I just had a few lip‑outs, but like I said, they were good strokes and that's really all you can do is commit to the line and put a good stroke on it, and if it's a bad read, it's a bad read.  
I'm only three back right now so just keep on shooting under par, 4‑ or 5‑under, and that will put me in good position for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Is the golf course different from last year?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Well, I heard they didn't overseed it, so it's just not as green, but greens are in pretty good shape, rolling good, pretty fast actually.   It's always in good shape, it has been every year, so I always look forward to playing.  
   
 Q.   Is it harder to tee off later in the morning?   Tomorrow obviously you have an earlier tee‑off time, can that be to your advantage?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   I think it will probably be a little less wind.   Actually calmed down towards the end today.   Probably be good sleeping‑wise because I woke up really early this morning.   I like playing in the morning, getting up, and ready to go tee off early.   
   
 Q.   Scoring today‑‑  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I would have thought it would be around 5‑ or 6‑under.   I see that out here.   There's a lot of 4‑unders and that's pretty much the whole leaderboard out there.   You can score well on this golf course.   There are some birdie holes that you can take advantage of.   
   
 Q.   Last year you got 15‑under to win, 3‑under, three rounds to go, it's not inconceivable you could get there or even better?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, I definitely think I can do it.
