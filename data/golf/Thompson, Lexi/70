 Q.  Lexi, Cristie, you guys have trailed one hole this entire competition.  Cristie, what do you think has been the key really to your success?  
CRISTIE KERR: We don't like being down.  We don't.  You know, we try to make as many birdies as we can, and I'm sure she gets sick of me after a while saying, come on, let's go, let's go.  But we ham-and-egged it really well again, and she lifted me up, and I was there kind of when I needed to be, so that's what a good team is.   
 Q.  Lexi, don't want to give away in the secrets, but you guys have been really dominant in team competition together.  What is your strategy like out there, and how do you approach things hole to hole?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I think kind of what Cristie already said.  We ham-and-egged it very well, and like today, it played very tough out there.  Pars were winning some of the holes actually.  When I struggled, she was there picking me up.  But I think what makes us so strong is our attitudes out there with each other.  We're all pumping each other up, putting positive thoughts in each other's minds, and we're always there for each other.  That's what makes good partners.   
 Q.  Cristie, quick turnaround.  What are your thoughts heading into the next round of matches.  
CRISTIE KERR: Well, hopefully the weather holds out.  I know tomorrow looks pretty awful.  Just go kind of have a little powwow with our team, get rested up, get ready to go.
