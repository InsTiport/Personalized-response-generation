Q. 4 & 3 against Thailand today.  What was the difference for you guys today versus yesterday?
CRISTIE KERR: We just got it going early.  We got up in the match early and just rode the momentum.  We gave a couple holes back during the match, but we made so many birdies, it didn't matter.
Q. What did you guys talk about to kind of turn things around for today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Just to stay positive with it.  We had a rough day yesterday, but there was good golf being played, we just got beat.  We just had to come into today with a positive attitude and just focus on the good things.
