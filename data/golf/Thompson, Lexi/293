 Q.  Well, this was pretty good.  You shot a 76 yesterday, and in your opening round.  You're plus 12 for the championship, you have five holes left to complete the second round.  How happy are you the way this championship has gone so far, I would imagine you're pretty psyched? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Well -- 

 Q.  You think you could have played better? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, much better.  The first time I played today from yesterday I hit like one fairway, that caused me to shoot, I think, 3-over.  So, no, 2-over, I think, I don't know, because I chipped in on the last hole. 

 Q.  Right. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  So I'm not hitting the ball so good, but I'm just trying to make pars. 

 Q.  Which you need to do in Open Championships.  You got to see that swing, that first one, did you like it? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah.  I don't think I've hit a good drive like that today.  I hit one. 

 Q.  You tried to qualify for this tournament when you were ten.  You didn't get past regional qualifying.  I don't know the result from last year. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  I think I shot an 80.  I think I shot 77 when I was 10 and then 80. 

 Q.  So apparently it has been your goal for a long time to have this experience? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah, I mean, I knew it would be an awesome experience coming in at such a young age and it is. 

 Q.  Are there one or two special things you'll go home and remember? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Well, I met Annika Sorenstam, so that was really cool.  Just seeing all the LPGA Tour golfers. 
 I have never gone to a LPGA Tour golf tournament, I usually go to my brothers sometimes.  So it was pretty cool. 

 Q.  And has this helped you to know where you need your game to go? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yeah.  I played with these two girls today and they pretty much like hit it in the fairway every time. 

 Q.  That's a good thing. 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  That's what I was hoping for, but it didn't quite work out for me. 

 Q.  It's a family affair here for the Thompsons.  You mentioned your brother, who is a very fine player on the Nationwide Tour, second on the money list.  He came out early in the week and helped you get accustomed to the yardages.  And you have another brother who is a pretty good golfer.  And from the parents, who I hear could be the best of the group, Chris? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Yes. 

 Q.  How old is he? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  He's 14. 

 Q.  What's he doing golf-wise right now? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  He's playing in -- 

 Q.  Junior events? 
 ALEXIS THOMPSON:  Junior events and if he gets exemptions he plays in the AJGA championships.
