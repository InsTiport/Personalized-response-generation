 Q.  Much better day than yesterday.  I know it was a little frustrating.  What did you do to turn it around?  
LEXI THOMPSON: I just kind of figured out a little something with my putting that worked and that helped me out today.  I didn't hit it that great off the tee today.  I hit it a lot better off the tee yesterday, but I just got more putts today.   
 Q.  A lot of birdies too.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I definitely got a few putts to roll in, which was nice, and that always helps out.   
 Q.  Rain, how are the conditions?  This is obviously something.  
LEXI THOMPSON: I wasn't planning on the rain today.  I didn't have the umbrella or rain gear, so I had my dad run in and get my umbrella with four holes to go, so lucky for that.  But, yeah, definitely put a damper on things, but still have to play in it.   
 Q.  Position for tomorrow, you still have to be very thrilled.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I am.  Tomorrow's supposed to be a little rainy conditions too, so we've just got to play it by ear and see how it goes and just take one shot at a time with how many holes we get in.   
 Q.  And pack an umbrella?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, umbrella and rain pants, rain hat, everything.   
 Q.  Anything else that stuck out today, ball striking, putting?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, the putting was good, but I hit a few really good iron shots and I had a good bogey save on number 16 there and a good par save on the last hole which helped out.
