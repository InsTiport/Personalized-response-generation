Q. What was the story of your day?
LEXI THOMPSON: How did my day go?
Q. Give us the story.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it was a pretty good day.  I putted really well and didn't hit too many fairways, was a little off, off the tee, but they were very solid tee shots, they were just staying out a little bit right on me, but overall very consistent day.
Q. How is the putting relaxing the rest of your game?  When you're confident with the putter clearly you don't put any pressure on your long game, or am I wrong on that?
LEXI THOMPSON: No, it definitely helps.  There's not as much pressure on my long game with my putting being well, and then I missed a few greens and gave myself looks for pars, but when I had birdie putts, I knew I was stroking it well, so I went into it a little more confidently.
Q. Hitting it the right speed?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, well, I changed putters.  I changed to the Cure putter, so I've been working on it this week, and it's just all about confidence, really.  That's all putting is.  I'm feeling good with it.
Q. That thing is big.  It's a big face.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah.  Well, you know, I stand pretty far away from it, and actually the putter you actually just screw the bolts in where you want to stand, so I just stand where I'm comfortable and then just screw it in.  My other putter the toe was up a lot, so it might have been causing me to be inconsistent with it.
Q. So you've gone away from the eyes closed.  Tell us maybe what you've gained from that and why you thought, okay, I don't need to do it anymore.  What's the thinking?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I basically changed everything this week with my eyes open now.  But it was good for me.  I used it as a drill before I did it in tournament, just to feel out my stroke a lot more, and it happened to work in the few tournaments I played in and I was feeling really confident with it, but I just started worrying a lot with my eyes closed, and I just went away from it after last week, and changed putters, eyes open, so why not change it all if you're going to change it, right?
Q. You didn't accidentally close your eyes?
LEXI THOMPSON: No, not today.  I did a lot last week.  I was just so unsure about it, which probably caused a lot of the weakness on the greens, but it's all good.
Q. How much was the wind a factor today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it got windy.  There was a lot of shots towards the end that you couldn't even really get close to the pins, like on No. 9 there, I had a full lob wedge, and it's kind of tough to get it close to that pin with down and right wind.
Q. Confident going into the rest of the week?  You're obviously confident on this golf course.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely a good start to the week.  I mean, I love this golf course, and it's obviously in great shape for us this week.  It's so pure right now.  Yeah, I just love being here in Palm Springs.  It brings back a lot of great memories and a lot of confidence, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.
Q. What was the pairing like with Brittany?  A lot of people were excited to see two of the biggest hitters in the game playing together.  Do you guys have fun with that, or is it not a big deal?
LEXI THOMPSON: Well, we hit a lot of drivers, a lot of drivers and 3-woods out there, but she's a lot of fun.  She's so relaxed and always cracking jokes.  Even when she hits a bad shot you can never really tell.  She's just out there so relaxed.  I enjoy playing with her, and she's obviously a great player.
Q. Do you try to out-drive each other or that doesn't come into play?
LEXI THOMPSON: No, not really.  She had said a comment on No. 11, our second hole today.  She's like, I need all the distance I can get playing with you today, trying to keep up.  But really you've just got it keep it in the fairway out here.  She's a long player, but that's all for us, just keeping it in the fairway really.
