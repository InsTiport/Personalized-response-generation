  Q. Here with Lexi Thompson, winner here back in 2014.  2-under 70 to start the week.  How are feeling about the round?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   I feel good it.  Overall just a very steady day.  I had some birdie opportunities out there, fairly often, some reads, but I also hit a few really bad shots too.
 Overall it was just a good day.  Perfect weather out there and the greens were rolling great.  Can't ask for much better.
 Q. We spoke earlier this week about all the work you've been putting in on your game and beginning to work with instructor Martin Hall as well.  How confident did you feel in those changes out there today?
 LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, you know, change is always very uncomfortable at first, but he keeps it very simple with me.  I went to those lessons with him, you know, I'm not technical.  Just to gain a little bit more consistency with my ball striking, and we've kind of done that.
 So I'm continuing to work on the things he told me and getting tighter.
