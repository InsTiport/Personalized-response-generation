  STACY LEWIS:   It's hard to trust that, so coming out here it's only a two‑club wind today, so it was kind of nice, and we kind of just fed off each other and made some birdies.  
   
 Q.   You both really had a great front nine, and we talk so much about feeding off one another.   Does that really happen out there?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it definitely does.   We were talking about that we probably had the best golf going on today, we had so many birdies.   The first two days we were ball‑striking it well, just didn't make that many putts, but today we were definitely feeding off each other off of birdies.  
   
 Q.   Talk about what's ahead of you tomorrow, potentially 20 holes or more.   
STACY LEWIS:   Well, I'm glad we got through as many holes as we did today, but we're in a good spot, we can get out early and hopefully get a good start like we did today and post a number and see what happens.
