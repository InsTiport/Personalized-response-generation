 Q.   Should you important was that finish for you?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   It was a very important finish.   I knew I could birdie a few of the last paragraph fives that I had but just tried to stay within one shot at a time‑out here and hit these fairways.   I stayed patient for the most part and that was the important part.  
   
 Q.   Did it feel like this morning it was there for the taking?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   I wouldn't say there was too low of a score out there because there's so many hard holes but you can definitely shoot about 4‑ or 5‑under, especially today with the wind being down.   But I'll take my even par and hopefully get it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You're a little under the weather, tell us about that.   
LEXI THOMPSON:   I've had a little cold the last four or five days.   I feel like I have enough energy.   Just a little congested.   I'm good.   
I had it before I left but the flying probably didn't make it much better.
