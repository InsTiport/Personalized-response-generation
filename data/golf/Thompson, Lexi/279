   MODERATOR: We're here with Alexis Thompson, who shot a 5-under par, 67, 8-under for the tournament. Walk us through your scorecard today.  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I think I had two bogeys on 16 and 13. Yeah, I had two bogeys overall. Obviously seven birdies, so -- well, no, 6 birdies and an eagle.   
 So it just went really well. I hit it pretty good today. My putting helped out a lot today too, so...  
 MODERATOR: Can you walk us through the eagle?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I was on the last hole. I had 198 to the pin, 190 to the front. I hit a 5-iron and didn't see it land until I watched to the on the screen. Just cut towards the fence, so it was good.  
 MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Couple things. First of all, I saw on the range you crossed out or somebody crossed out the A and the S on your name card. Do you like Lexi?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I didn't notice that, but. Yeah, I do like Lexi. Everybody calls me that.  
  
  Q. Several people were talking and I thought, Let's start with that. Great round.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Thank you.  
  
  Q. Welcome to Evian. This is your first time here. Give me your impressions of the event and the course.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's been an awesome experience for me. Just looking around, just great views here on the course and in town. It's a lot of fun for me.   
 The course is great, too. I've been having a lot of fun with the groups I've had, too.   
  
  Q. How did the course play today? Obviously very well, but did you think it was really wet, because you tee'd off a little later?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, it's definitely wet out there, but the shots are holding in the greens a lot better too, so that's good for us.  
 So we can just go for all the pins because you know they won't bounce over and they'll just plug right in the green.  
  
  Q. So you can attack?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, you can attack the pins today. That was good.   
  
  Q. Your goal was to finish in the first ten when you arrived.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. It's still the case, or do you have bigger ambitions now?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No, it's definitely different goals now that I'm only one back. Just want to go out tomorrow and play like did I today: free swinging and trust it and try to make birdies like I did today.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us what your schedule is for the rest of year and plans for next season?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Well, we're only sure of three more events for the rest of this year. The Wal-Mart, Arkansas, the Navistar, and the Canadian Open are the only ones we're sure of so far.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: No, haven't thought about that. I'm taking one tournament at a time and see where it takes me.  
  
  Q. What's your dad's name?   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Scott.  
  
  Q. Did you hit your 5-iron very close on 18?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I hit it to five feet.  
  
  Q. This is your third event as a pro?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Tell us about the other two.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, the first one was the Shop Rite. That didn't go too good for me, but it was a lot fun and it was a great tournament.   
 The second one was the Open. That was a great experience. So that was a lot of fun for me. I had my whole family there. It was a great experience.   
  
  Q. Is your father here this week?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, he's right behind you. He's my caddie.   
 MODERATOR: Any other questions?   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, I played in the Australian Open. I came in 16th. I was an amateur, yeah.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Yeah, well, you know, I turned pro after the Curtis Cup. I just felt that my game was ready, and I wanted to end my amateur career with the Curtis Cup.   
 It was a great experience for me at that tournament too, just going straight to my next one. It was a good decision, I think.   
  
  Q. Would you say your greatest achievement was your U.S. Open performance a couple weeks ago?  
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: I think maybe making it there when I was 12 was pretty big. They are both pretty big. So they were great experiences and great achievements for me.   
 MODERATOR: Thanks, Lexi.   
 ALEXIS THOMPSON: Thank you.
