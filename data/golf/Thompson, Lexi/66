 Q.  You have to be a little bit disappointed not defending this crown, but I watched you on 18, all smiles.  You and So Yeon fought so hard.  How great were crowds this week?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Oh, they were unbelievable.  A lot more people out today knowing the weather was going to be perfect, but they have amazing cheering us on.  So Yeon played unbelievable golf.  I knew coming into this round that I had to make birdies to win and sometimes tie holes with her because I knew she was dropping putts from everywhere.   
 Q.  You know how big a lot of these players are and how much they mean to the game here.  Obviously you want to win the title, but to watch them get this victory on their home soil, it's kind of special.  What was it like for you?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, I can only imagine how special it is to win this title.  It was amazing just to be here and just to have the UL International Crown bring in all the other countries, seven other countries besides the U.S.   
It's such a great format, and it allows those players to be able to represent their country.  And that's what they need.  They want to do that.   
 Q.  And just lastly, feeding on what you just said, how important has this golf tournament become in just its third year?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's become very important.  Besides Solheim, just U.S. against Europe, it gives these other players a great opportunity to represent their country and play as a team and get that feeling.   
Golf is it such as individual support, and some of the players don't get that opportunity very often, and I think it's unbelievable for them.  I think they really thrive on it.
