Q. Nice little bounce-back round today.
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, a lot different than yesterday.  Yesterday was just a struggle on the greens.  Don't really know what was going on.  I hit it great yesterday.  Just the hole seemed like a penny size.
But today it was overall very solid day out there.
Q. Coming into today was there anything you tried to focus onto put yesterday behind you?
LEXI THOMPSON: I would say my attitude was the main focus.  Even if I played bad today, my main focus was just to have a good attitude out there.
I guess the good attitude came with the good play.  Then just committing to my lines.  We worked on a little putting after my round yesterday and changed a few things.
It's all about confidence, especially in this wind.
Q. Conditions today a little bit easier with the wind?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it wasn't as windy today, that's for sure.  It got gusty on a few holes, but a few pins were a lot more accessible.  There was a few on some holes that you could get close to.
Still have to commit to your lines in this wind to get the wind right.
Q. What did you hit on the eagle on 5?
LEXI THOMPSON: Driver, 9-iron again.
Q. How long was that?
LEXI THOMPSON: I had 164 to the pin, downwind.
Q. Putt was how long?
LEXI THOMPSON: About 12 feet.
Q. (No microphone.)
LEXI THOMPSON: On No.4 I hit a pitching wedge to about six feet before the hole and made that.
Then I hit another pitching wedge on No. 8, yeah, to about 20 feet.
Q. Putter was a lot more comfortable in your hands today?
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, it's all about confidence.  Just unfortunately I missed one on my first hole yesterday and couldn't really get the confidence back.  Yeah, felt a lot better today.
I still hit a bad putt on the first hole today but drained a long one on the second one, so I got my confidence back pretty quick.
