 Q.   Thanks so much for coming up here, Lexi.   Can you walk us through your round, tell us what happened today?   
LEXI THOMPSON:   Yeah, it was sort of an up‑and‑down day.   I had two doubles and a few bogeys, but I bounced back and made a few birdies.   But overall it was an all right day, but sort of a roller coaster.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about 18?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   18, I hit a good drive, and then I just pulled my iron shot.   I was aiming towards the middle of the green and just pulled it pretty bad.   Then didn't end up getting up and down, but I hit a good putt and made double.  
   
 Q.   How about the 9th hole?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   9 hole, I just came out of my second shot and ended up 3‑putting.   It was a little slower and ended up 3‑putting.  
   
 Q.   You're really the only player in the afternoon to put on a score.   Were you aware of that?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I didn't really pay attention to it.   I was just going out with the same attitude no matter what they shot.   I was trying to make birdies and pars and ended up making a few bad scores, but it happens at Opens.  
   
 Q.   I don't know if you saw Michelle Wie shot 66.   Did you think there was a 66 on this course?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   It's out there.   As long as you just find the fairways and place your ball in the right spot on the greens.   It's definitely out there.   But you have to have your pretty much A‑plus game.  
   
 Q.   How was the course playing differently from today to yesterday?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   Today for me it was a lot longer of a day teeing off at 2:09.   But there wasn't much wind either days, maybe a few harder pin placements, but overall played pretty similar.  
   
 Q.   Are you expecting the USGA to make it a lot more difficult on the weekend?   What do you anticipate?  
LEXI THOMPSON:   I'm not sure.   They might push a few more tees back and tuck some pins.   That's what they do on the weekends.   Maybe challenge us a little bit more.
