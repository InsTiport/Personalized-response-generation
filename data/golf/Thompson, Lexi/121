 Q.  Lexi, gracious enough to spend a few minutes with us after a very disappointing finish to what was otherwise a very promising week.  What happened down the stretch, in your words?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Just struggled with the putter.  You know, I made everything seemed like all week, and then just two last putts I guess on the last two holes -- actually last three holes.  I had like a five-footer, six-footer, and about a four-footer and missed them all.   
If I made those I would've won, but that's golf I guess.   
 Q.  In regulation, the 72nd hole was a tough one to play defensively I think, but then in the playoff you had to be aggressive.  What happened?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, just my pitching has been a little rough and I've just been hitting it short a lot.  Just didn't commit to it.  I was in between numbers, and with the wind and knowing that you have to stop it really quick, just didn't commit.  That's all.   
 Q.  The way you're striking the ball and the way you putted all week -- like you say, it let you down the last three holes -- but the way you putted all week, are you at the point now where you show up and expect to be in this position?  
LEXI THOMPSON: Yeah, well, definitely.  I think everybody should.  Everybody is out here trying to win.   
I know with where my game is at, every time I tee it up I know I'm trying to win and I know I have a good chance of it.   
 Q.  This doesn't rank with the disappointment you felt at ANA obviously.  A lot of people felt that for you.  How long will this be on your mind?  
LEXI THOMPSON: It'll take the night.  Probably a day or so.  It's rough, but it's all right.
