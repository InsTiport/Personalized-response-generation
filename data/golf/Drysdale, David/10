Q.   Overall, pretty good? 
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Yeah, well, I didn't actually know my score, because I had a little bit of a‑‑ I hit a tee shot on 6 that plugged in the bunker face and it was like plugged three inches onto the ground and I didn't mark it before I pulled the ball out, which you're supposed to do.   If it's one‑shot penalty or not‑‑ we'll see. 

Q.   But you   made the cut, playing St. Andrews tomorrow, must be looking forward to it. 
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Yeah, last couple days have been tough.   I haven't played that well.   But I haven't been playing well recently, so like I said to you yesterday, nice to be here no matter what happens with that penalty, be here tomorrow.

Q.   Nice to be on the cut line knowing that it could go either way?
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Exactly.
