 Q.   What happened on the two 2s?   
DAVID DRYSDALE:   I hit an 8‑iron on No. 3 to about four feet and a 5‑iron to about eight feet at No. 6 and then a 4‑iron to about four or five feet on No.9.   Seemed easy at this point but got a little bit harder after that.   
   
 Q.   You didn't drop anything but you didn't birdie anything.   
DAVID DRYSDALE:   On the back nine, no.   Had a good chance on 10, misread the putt.   Had good chances all week, missed quite a few sort of 6‑, 7‑, 8‑footers, but solid from tee‑to‑green again today.   
   
 Q.   Good week for you, hasn't it.   
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Yeah, absolutely.   I've been playing all right, Wentworth and Wales, had a couple of weeks off and last week was a wee bit rusty in Germany.   Struck the ball nicely this week.   Played beautifully yesterday when we had the rain right from the first to the 18th.   It was really solid.   
Overall, game is in good shape and looking forward to next week and obviously Scottish Open in a couple of weeks' time.
