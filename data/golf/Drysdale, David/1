 Q.  How difficult a start was that for you in that semifinal?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Tough start, tough opening hole, long par 4.  I can't think of too many shots on The European Tour as tight as that.  He played solid, anyway, from tee-to-green.  Disappointing start but I'd have taken it at the start of the week, third or fourth.   
 Q.  What can you take from this week?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Nothing but positives.  Really good stuff the first three days.  Haven't been quite on it today but yeah, looking forward.  Obviously a couple big Rolex Series Events the next couple weeks, courses that I like.  Just more of the same, more hard work.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the new event, have you enjoyed it?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: I have.  Yeah, interesting.  We don't get to do much match play but medal match play is a totally different concept over nine holes.  I've enjoyed it so far.  It's been good fun.   
 Q.  Nice change from 72-hole stroke play?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, absolutely.  That's run-of-the-mill golf, isn't, it four rounds and finishing on Sunday afternoon.  It is a nice change.
