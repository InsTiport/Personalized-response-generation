Q. David, very well played.  How do you reflect on today's opening round?
DAVID DRYSDALE: Delighted with the score.  Played lovely.  Lovely chances.  Could have been a little bit lower, but 65, I'll take it.
Q. The course conditions, going to be a low-scoring week, but overall the course in great shape, how do you assess it?
DAVID DRYSDALE: The rough is definitely up from the last couple of years.  The first couple of years we came here, it was really bad.  It's nice to see a little bit of rough there.  It's so soft, it's playing a lot wider than you would expect.
Q. 98 in the Race to Dubai heading into the week.  What are your thoughts and hopes as you kick off this week in the regular season?
DAVID DRYSDALE: Make it a sort of last push to try to get in the Top-10.  Of course, if we can get in there, hopefully we'll shine at Dubai.
Q. You've given yourself a great chance, great start.  Thoughts heading into day two?
DAVID DRYSDALE: Last out tomorrow, so I don't know if we'll get finished.  Just be patient and keep doing what I'm doing.  I've been playing lovely the last sort of couple of months.  Just knock a few putts in.
