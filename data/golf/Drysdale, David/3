 Q.  David, your assessment of the first round, 4-under 68?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, it was pretty solid.  I was the first game out.  Got the greens pure this morning.  Fantastic to putt them.  Course played a little longer the first seven or eight holes.  But overall, quite happy.   
 Q.  What pleased you most about your round today?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Just hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  The greens are really quite small here, so if you're hitting a lot of greens, you're giving yourself chances.  Yeah, probably my iron play.   
There's been some decent stuff, 15th last week, Dunhill Links.  I haven't done an awful lot recently but the game is coming around.   
 Q.  Give us a sense of the conditions overall.  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Perfect.  Perfect weather.  One-mile-an-hour wind, no wind to speak of.  Yeah, just ideal.  Like I say, playing a little long this morning at ten to eight.  It was cool but the greens are fantastic.  Some of the best greens we've putted on all year.
