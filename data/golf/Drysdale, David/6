 Q.  Golf is all about consistency, you tied for 16 over a tough course in France last week and you've made a good, solid start here.  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, played lovely last week.  Didn't get in any trouble, which is key around Paris National.  Rolled it into today, hit a lot of fairways and greens, and quite a stress-free round.   
 Q.  Highlight was the eagle today.  Tell us about that.  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, hit a drive up the left side just in the first cut of rough.  Nice little cut, rescue, just about half a yard short of the green.  Pin was nine on, so about 20 feet, left-to-right, and so that was a little bonus.   
 Q.  Two quite interesting nines.  The first one is more up-and-down and the second one is a little bit flatter.  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, the first time I saw it was on Tuesday.  Walked through the clubhouse and sat on the first tee and thought, wow, looks amazing.   
 Q.  The wind seems to be picking up a little bit this afternoon.  Conditions were fairly still this morning.  Are those the kind of conditions you have to take advantage on these kind of golf courses?  
DAVID DRYSDALE: I think you do.  Calm the first ten, 11 holes this morning; that's links golf.  You have to take advantage because you know the wind is going to pick up at some point.
