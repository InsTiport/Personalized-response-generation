Q.   This must do a lot for your confidence. 
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Definitely.   I mean, it's one of these things, I haven't won a tournament out here‑‑ the problem every year is having enough money to keep your card and the quicker you do, that the less pressure you're under. 
Looking at the scoreboard coming in there, looking at Paul Lawrie and Branden Grace, seems like they are all off to fantastic starts to the season and they are almost in a situation where they are free‑wheeling, relaxed playing golf, and certainly takes a bit of pressure off in that sense.   Hopefully I can build on it for the rest of the year. 

Q.   There have been numerous occasions where you have come into the back end of the year wondering what the future would hold, so should make it more relaxed from now on. 
DAVID DRYSDALE:   There have certainly been a couple of close scrapes the wrong way and a couple of close scrapes I've had in the right way the last few years. 
To be honest I haven't really thought about‑‑ it's not really been on my mind the last three or four years of trying to keep my card.   It's been trying to get myself into positions to win tournaments but it is nice to have it done and dusted as quick as possible.
