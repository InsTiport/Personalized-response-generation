Q.   Tell us how it went today, bit of a different kettle of fish here?
DAVID DRYSDALE:   I putted poorly, really, really poorly, started with a double at the 10th.   Set the trend really.   Holed a lot of good par putts.   Didn't hit a lot of greens, and then managed to birdie 6 and 7 to get it under par.   Then gave it back on No.9, which I deserved to be honest.   Level par was‑‑ could easily have signed for 76, 4‑over.

Q.   Bit of a surprise after yesterday, but on a different course like this‑‑
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Not really.   Haven't been practicing or playing that well.   Yesterday was a surprise how I played yesterday.   I guess the pins at St. Andrews were all in the middle of the greens and quite easy, and today, just got found out really for how I've been playing.   Sort of back to the range.

Q.   Tomorrow at Kingsbarns, lowest scoring there, a chance to push on there?
DAVID DRYSDALE:   Hopefully if the weather stays the same, definitely has the most birdie chances on it; but if it gets windy there, I think it's probably the toughest of the three with the way the greens are.   But we'll see what happens tomorrow.
