Q.  Did you eat today after being so nervous yesterday?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I had half a bacon roll on the range! That was it and a couple of puffs of the cigarette.
Q.  Was that the worst you could have scored today?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I played better today than yesterday from tee to green. I had a complete fat duff at the seventh but other than that I hit it close. I couldn't get the putts in. Burned the hole all day. Just over-reading them I think and allowing too much borrow. That's something I will have to sort out this afternoon, I think.
Q.  Satisfied with the halfway total?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Yes, satisfied with my position but the round today could and should have been a lot better.
Q.  Players were saying that there is a low score out there?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Definitely. The guy in front of me was close. There is a low score out there. The greens do spike up a bit as the day goes on but they are still rolling nicely.
Q.  How does this event compare to others?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  This is a massive tournament for me. I've played most of my golf on the Challenge Tour this year so it's nice to see the TV cameras and the crowds and playing in this weather. It's awesome.
Q.  Do you like the big-time atmosphere?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Well, I get a bit nervous as I said yesterday but I seem to be able to deal with it. Once I'm off and running I'm okay.
Q.  Is that the most pleasing thing?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Yes, absolutely. There were a lot more watching me today, which was good. I hope to keep it going now.
