GORDON SIMPSON:  Well played today wonderful round of 65, I suppose leading a tournament and being Scott in Scotland and to the issue is something you feel quite proud of at the moment.
DAVID DRYSDALE:  It's fantastic.  I'm over the moon with the round.  It's funny    you need that more often    certainly in the past    I don't know why.
GORDON SIMPSON:  What worked today specifically?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  The game's come around last couple week, ball striking has been excellent.  Putter has let me down.  Today a holed a few putts today and that was the difference.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  My wife and watching and my dad and quite a few friends.  I don't know it just seems to be, everything up here in Scotland    playing in front of home crowd, difficult to explain.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  It was.  It's a bonus.  I could get one or two through the summer    25th I think.  I had a good first round last year as well.  I was 5 under in the first round last year.  So hope I can keep it going this year.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Still a long way to go.  It's a very good start but anything can happen.

Everything was okay after the first tee, but just the build up.  It's like a sick feeling in your stomach.  I had some eggs and struggled to get them down.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  Of course it has, yes.  I won a couple years ago and then won two or three months again and it certainly wasn't much fun before that.  I'm confident, playing okay but not quite consistently    inaudible?
Q.  What did you hit on
DAVID DRYSDALE:  3 iron    to three feet.     in the bunker and third shot, holed from 25 feet.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  No, sorry, first playoff hole.  It was all right.  I was in the zone I think.  I'm fine as the round goes on, but the first tee, I'm more nervous now, actually.  (Laughter).
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I've worked with Gary Hughes (ph) for the last three seasons I think.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I think it helps you to focus more when there's only one or two people watching.  When there's a lot of people it seems to be easier to have sort of tunnel vision if you like.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  There's not an awful lot of Scottish guys on The European Tour but there are a lot on the challenge tours.  Montgomerie has been the main one for last few years but    inaudible    so I think the future's looking great for Scottish golf at the moment.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I've love to get    we'll wait and see, that's a long way off.  I've never been there.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Tell us about the birdie holes today.
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I birdied my first hole, the 10th, I hit a drive and 5 iron to about 35 feet.

No. 13, short of the green in two, sand wedge up to about 15 feet.

No. 1, 9 iron there to three inches behind the hole.

2 putt on No. 3.

8 iron No. 8 to 12 feet.

And sand wedge at the last to about eight feet.  And a good safe at 16.  Somebody made some noise and I hit it so bad and just laid up.  And a good up and down on No. 7, I drove it in the right hand rough.  Keeps the round going.  I started off steadily and the shot at 16, it was a great up and down.  Really kept the round going.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID DRYSDALE:  I'm sure not that long ago.  I think strictly all year    I haven't been putting that badly.  I've been 2 putting.  I like these things for some reason quite well and two or three years ago as well.  They seem to suit my eye.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Well played today.  Thank you.
