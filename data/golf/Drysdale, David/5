DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, it wasn't half.  I was struggling away fine, but the 12th really cost me this afternoon, a bit disappointed with that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Just missed it right.  Thinking back, reflecting on it even over the last few holes, I was in too close to the flag, I was just totally -- I had no stance, really.  And went underneath it to the left and it went back in the bunker.  Yeah, it was just stuff that you wouldn't probably see the process doing, that stuff, missing on the short side.  But, yeah, just something to reflect on.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, I mean it was an absolutely amazing experience to play in such a big crowd, to play with John Daly was great, too.  There's a lot of positives.  Made a good number of birdies again today.  But just too many mistakes, which is going to cost me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Yeah, the last few were pretty solid.  I missed a good chance for birdie on 18, which was a little bit disappointing.  But like I said, I played pretty solid, but just bigger numbers -- I haven't been doing much this season, which cost me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Just the whole week has been so special.  Having all my family and friends down is not something you always get.  And I was obviously -- it was great to see them following around and stuff.  So, yeah, that was there.  And it was obviously great to be here this week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: It told me it was going to go right today, because he came and apologized and did the same thing (laughter).   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID DRYSDALE: Probably lost what he was doing on 17.  He got a bad break.  But he was really, really good to play with.  It was good to chat even about past results, even stuff like that.  He's obviously a very knowledgeable guy, so it was good.
