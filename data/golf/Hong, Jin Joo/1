 Q. How do you feel about today and your playing? 
 JIN JOO HONG: First, I was really nervous about my shots. I wasn't really sure how they were going to go. 
 On the ninth hole I made a birdie, and after that my confidence really developed and kind of launched from there. 

 Q. How much have you learned since 2006? 
 JIN JOO HONG: She says she didn't succeed the way they she wanted to, and she was frustrated. But it's starting to get better and right now she's starting to feel a lot more comfortable and starting to feel good a little more.

 Q. What do you feel is the best part of your game right now? What are you feeling really confident about? 
 JIN JOO HONG: Basically all of the short game: Chipping, putting, around the greens. I have a lot of feel. I feel I've gotten a lot better there. 

 Q. What was your best hole of the day do you think, the 9th hole? 
 JIN JOO HONG: It was the 10th hole. I didn't hit a great shot for my approach, but I made a birdie anyway. So I just said it felt great knowing that even with a bad shot, I can still make birdie.
