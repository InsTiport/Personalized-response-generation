   PAM WARNER:  We have Jin Joo Hong, also at 7-under and tied for the lead.  Can you just talk about your round today and how you played?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  The shots were like very unstable but the short game and the putting was pretty good for today.  So that's why I made a lot of par saves and when I had a chance to birdie, I made those.   
 PAM WARNER:  Can we go over your birdies and bogeys on your scorecard?  Birdie on 5 was your first one.   
 JIN JOO HONG:  First of all, driver was okay and then the second shot was on the green like three yards from the pin.   
 PAM WARNER:  What club did you use?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  52.  And I made that.   
 PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 9, the par 5.   
 JIN JOO HONG:  Driver to 65 yards.  Third shot was 65 yards from the pin and I played a 58-degree wedge.  The putt was four yards.   
 PAM WARNER:  Bogey on 10.   
 JIN JOO HONG:  Driver and 7-iron.  It was on the green from the right side so I 3-putted it.   
 PAM WARNER:  Then you came back with a birdie on 11.   
 JIN JOO HONG:  Driver and 6-iron to the right side of the green, four yards from the pin.   
 Drive went into the rough and I hit 8-iron out.  It was short and hit the tree and it was like 25 yards from the pin, 58 degree wedge and it was a little far from the pin, but it was on the green.   
 Next 3-wood, I was 70 yards from the pin.  I used my 58-degree wedge and it was on the green.  The putt was really, really long, more than like ten yards.  It was really, really long, and I made that putt, about ten yards.  It was pretty far.   
 PAM WARNER:  You're in the lead.  How do you feel going into this weekend with the lead?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  It's the first tournament I'm leading this year and I'm pretty happy about it.   
 My shots today were really unstable so I want to make it right and I want to play on the weekend really, really well and I want to do the right things on the weekend and make things happen.   
 PAM WARNER:  You won last year in Korea to join the LPGA Tour, will you use that win, the experience that you had there, for the weekend?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  It's not the same but I'm using the experience from when I won.  It's different from Korea and here, so I just have to make adjustments on it.  I want to do well, yeah.   
  
  Q.  What was the tournament you won?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  KOLON-Hana Bank Championship.   
  
  Q.  Are you feeling nervous at all about going into tomorrow being co-leader?   
 JIN JOO HONG:  Not yet.  I actually don't recognise the nerves and everything.   
 I was kind of nervous yesterday because I was at third, but now I'm fine with it.   
 PAM WARNER:  Thank you very much.
