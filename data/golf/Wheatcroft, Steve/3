 Q.  The shot you were trying to execute from the bunker on 18, what was the mind-set?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: It was an easy shot to be honest with you.  It was a perfect lie, sitting right in the bottom of the bunker.  All I was trying to do was try not to chunk it out of there and let it run down the hill.  I dug my feet in and realized there was zero sand underneath my shoes.   
Obviously you can't test the surface.  I mean, you can't play from that.  I don't know how else -- what I could have done any different.  It was an easy bunker shot.  I actually said to my caddie, I was like, I think I can make this shot.   
I hit it.  I hit it kind of right where I wanted to and the club absolutely bounced off the sand.  There was nothing in there.  I took my club and raked around in there and for about a full yard in there, there was not even an eighth 1/8th inch of sand anywhere in there.  It was just rock hard.   
It's a brutal way to lose a golf tournament.  I didn't feel like I did much wrong in there.  I tried to cut the 4-iron in there and it didn't cut.  I'm sure I had a little nerves going.  I'm sure I kept it a little too far to the left but I knew the bunker shot was easy.  Just wish there would have been sand underneath.
