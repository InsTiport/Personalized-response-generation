 Q.  Gotta feel good about a top 5?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: Yeah, definitely.  Not the Sunday I wanted.  They definitely changed the golf course up on us.  Took us four or five holes to figure that out.  Can't imagine too much water went on the greens last night.  They were rock hard.   
Hit two perfect shots on the first hole.  Watched them sail over, bounce over the green, and made a bogey.  Just couldn't get anything going today.   
Made a couple of mistakes early.  But, I mean, I hit -- I couldn't have hit better shots into 9, 10, 12.  And didn't get any of them within 20 feet.  Very frustrating.  But obviously I've had an ugly year.  Gaining momentum and making a lot of cuts but not doing anything.  But definitely I'll take any top 5s I can get right now.   
 Q.  What changed this week where you felt you were hitting the ball so well?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: Putter came around.  Made a couple of tweaks with the putter.  And I started to see some go in in, I guess, the second round, because it's been ice cold here for a while.   
Just not -- when I hit it close, I'd miss them, wouldn't keep the par saves going.  Did a lot in the second round.  Gave me a lot of momentum with that, and a lot of the swing changes I've been making are slowly paying off.   
And I think it's all coming together nicely.  It's just a matter of whether or not I score.  And I'm definitely ready to get out of the altitude because we've been fooled left and right here on different winds or altitude.  It's a hard week.
