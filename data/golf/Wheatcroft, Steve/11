 Q.   Playing with Matt Kuchar, your thoughts on the day?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   It was a good day.   I didn't get what I wanted out of the back nine, but overall I would have taken second place this week and ran.   Obviously, it's been a struggle and I needed a good week for sure.   I'm very pleased with the way it went.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, Matt's a very seasoned, long‑time competitor.   What can you glean from playing a final round in the heat of battle and playing with Matt?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   Just that if I play well‑‑ these guys are all world class players, obviously, but my game held up pretty well.   It's good to play with the best and you want to play with the best, watch what they do, and try to learn, if you can learn anything from it, great.   
I was just trying to stay and play my game out there, not get ahead of myself, and it seemed to work out okay.   I'm probably going to come up short, but still a good week.  
   
 Q.   That birdie, birdie finish with 17 and 18 must feel pretty sweet.   
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   That helped to justify the back nine a little bit.   I was struggling all over the place.   Kept jamming putts by and had five feet on every hole, it seemed like.   I was really grinding out there.   Hoping to get into next week and help my status for the rest of the year.
