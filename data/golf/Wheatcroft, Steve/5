 Q.  What a fantastic finish, you almost holed out from 159?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: I thought it had to have gotten close.  We saw where it landed and saw it kind of sneak by the hole.  I'm very pleased with it.  I'll take it.  Always nice to finish with an eagle for sure.   
 Q.  You had a nice round going besides that, pretty even on each side.  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: It's a hard golf course right now.  It's just hard to get the ball close to the pins.  The greens are really firm.  Kind of Sunday firmness on a Thursday.  I'm not used to seeing that.   
Yeah, I just tried to hang in there.  I got off to a good start.  I birdied 1 and I 3-putted 2 for par, and then made one wild swing on 3.  After that, I kind of settled down.  I hit a lot of what I thought were good shots that didn't end up that good.  I was missing a lot of greens, just barely.  But did a good job scrambling and the putter came alive and saved me a couple good pars.  Nice to finish with birdie, par, eagle finish.   
 Q.  Is it because the wind, it's so tough to judge?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: There's a lot of weird angles out here.  You go after a flag and you pull it a little bit left but then the green runs out on the left-hand side so it runs right through.  Or just some tricky, really tricky shots, especially when they are firm like this.  If they are soft, it's one thing.  But when they are firm, it's hard to get the ball close.   
 Q.  I don't know what's on the menu, but I bet it's going to taste really good the way you finished?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT: Yeah, I never had a problem finishing a meal anyway, but I'm going to enjoy it a little bit more tonight.
