 Q.   Steven, what a solid round of golf, bogey‑free, and this golf course playing a little fast, wasn't it  
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   Yeah, it definitely was.   I didn't hit the ball well at all today to be honest with you.   I short gamed it around pretty well.   I think I only hit 10 or 11 greens, but just had a great eye on the greens all day and made a lot of putts.   
   
 Q.   We're seeing golfers come in playing a lot of 2‑irons, 3‑irons, 3‑woods off the tee.   How did you manage the golf course?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   I played pretty aggressively.   I like hitting drivers out here.   It's not playing too fast.   I've played here in the past where it's been really, really firm tee to green, and it doesn't seem like it's that bad this year, so I've been hitting a lot of drivers, trying to get it down a little further because I know I'm not hitting it very well, so I'm trying to get shorter irons in my hands and wedges in my hand and just‑‑ I know when I do that, I score very well.   It's just a matter of getting the driver in play right now.  
   
 Q.   You've got an ankle injury?  
STEVE WHEATCROFT:   I do.   I have a little ankle injury.   I've got it all taped up, though, and seems to be helping a lot.   I only played 10 holes in my practice round and I couldn't do it anymore.   It was just starting to hurt to walk.   I said you know what, I think I'm done.   I've seen this place before.   I'm going to go rest it, and I wrapped it the next day, and I'm putting it in an ice bath every night and just trying to get some of the swelling down.   But it's coming along.   It felt pretty good today.
