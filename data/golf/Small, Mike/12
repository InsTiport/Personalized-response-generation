 Q. How did it go out there? 
 MIKE SMALL: I struggled, it was a struggle most of the day and stayed relatively pain free until my 13th hole, then I made a triple bogey. So I played the first 12 holes and -- solid and then the wheels came off.

 Q. How is the heat affecting play at all?
 MIKE SMALL: Not at all.

 Q. Fantastic. What will you change the next round?
 MIKE SMALL: I gotta strike the ball better. I didn't make a birdie today. I didn't hit it close. Hit a couple errant shots that cost me. Didn't get much more fairways. Need to hit the ball better.
