  Q. Can you talk about the experience of being out here in the PGA, what it means for you guys?   
 MIKE SMALL: It's an opportunity to play well and make some money and compete, and that's what it's all about. It's a good opportunity.  
  
  Q. What can you take back to your students and your club, and from this experience?   
 MIKE SMALL: Well, you know, it's a lot of inside stories, stuff I saw, watching Ross competing and being on top of the leaderboard is pretty cool. But as far as I'm concerned I need to prepare a little better. You need some ammunition in this thing, you can't come in shooting blanks.   
  
  Q. So you'll be back?  
 MIKE SMALL: Oh, yeah.
