Q.   Can you talk about the round and the entire four days?
MIKE SMALL:  It was a wonderful experience.  Today I made one bogey, one double bogey and 16 pars.  So really, the way I hit it this week, the entire week it's positive.  It's positive I made the cut, it's positive I finished because I didn't hit that good.  But to gut it out and shoot 73 today, I didn't make a birdie on the weekend which is frustrating, but it's a positive experience.  The week and everything, it's a special thing for us, and I think it's a great thing that we're a part of and I really appreciate it very much.
Q.  What's next for you?
MIKE SMALL:  PGA end of this month in Chicago.
Q.  Now, this experience that you have on the Tour and these events, how do you take them and use them in your coaching?
MIKE SMALL:  Oh, I use them all the time.  We play tournament golf every week.  I've learned from the good things, I've learned from the bad things.  This has come up where I can relate to players, what they are going through, frustration, exhilaration or whatever and talk to them about how to handle it.
Q.  What's the first event in the fall?
MIKE SMALL:  I go to Inverness.
