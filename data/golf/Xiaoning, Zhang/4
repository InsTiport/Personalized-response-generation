In this current season of October, Shanghai has become the top sports destination, and we have the BMW Masters 2012 here as a world‑class top tournament.

             ZHANG XIAONING:   Distinguished guests, dear players, dear friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.   On the occasion of the 2012 BMW Masters on behalf of the Multi‑Ball Games Administrative Centre of the General Administration of Sport and the China Golf Association, I would like to extend my warmest welcome to all of you. 
The BMW Masters is one of the top golf events sponsored by BMW globally.   It\'s the first time in the past three years that BMW, once again, comes back to China to support the development of golf in China. 
The BMW Masters has become the second sport event with a prize money up to 7 million U.S. dollars in 2012 calendar year by the Chinese Golf Association.   I do believe that the BMW Masters will definitely be conducive to the development of golf sport in China, and it will also be conducive to the improvement of the skills and techniques of the golf players in China.   The participants to the BMW Masters 2012 constitutes a very strong field, and the top players in golf sport are coming to China to play the BMW Masters. 
With 78 high‑ranking players from 17 countries will be competing and playing in the BMW Masters 2012.   And also in the 2012 BMW Masters, there will be 14 Chinese players so that it breaks the record of the number of Chinese players in the events of the same level. 
And also, the No. 1 Asian players on the prize list in 2012 will also be joining this BMW Masters 2012.   With these participants coming into this game, it will definitely improve the popularity of golf sport in China and will attract more and more young players and talented players to join in this golf family.   And I do believe that in the next four days, we will definitely put on a very wonderful show for all of the spectators in order to ensure the smooth running of this event, I should offer a special thanks to the Shanghai Sports Bureau and government. 
As far as my knowledge is concerned, the government leaders in Shanghai are far‑sighted with great vision; Mayor Han and Vice Mayor Shen have very special tastes for sport and for golf, and they are very supportive to this event. 
Also, I would like to offer our special thanks to the Shanghai administration of sport and the Shanghai Baoshan people\'s government as well as the Shanghai Golf Association.   Thanks also goes to the Shanghai SRE group as well as the Lake Malaren as contributing to the great success of the BMW Masters 2012. 
Of course, our special thanks should go out to BMW.   They have done a lot for helping the development of golf sport in China.   On behalf of the Multi‑Ball Games Administrative Centre of General Administration of Sport, as well as the Chinese Golf Association, I would like to offer my special thanks and heart felt thanks to BMW as being tournament sponsors.   And also, I wanted to thank The European Tour for its great support to this event. 
The venue for the event is by Lake Malaren; the District of Baoshan sounds very similar to the Chinese version of BMW, so the treasures and also all of these treasures are put beside the Lake Malaren.   Malaren is developed by the SRE Group, and SRE also is a very beautiful Chinese name.   Indeed, we have all of the beautiful Chinese names coming together in this beautiful weather.   I sincerely wish that Baoshan district as well as BMW enjoy a very promising future and health of the BMW Masters will become stronger in the future. 
ECKHARD WANNIECK:   Distinguished government officials, dear partners, dear media friends, ladies and gentlemen, also on behalf of BMW headquarters, a warm welcome from our side.   As my colleague just stated, that China is of the utmost importance to the BMW group, both in terms of volume and in terms of growth. 
Our customers are demanding, but they are also enthusiastic about performance about innovation about sport.   That\'s why golf is for us the perfect platform to showcase our spirit; the spirit of our brand, dynamic precision aesthetics.   That\'s why we have been sponsoring golf globally for more than two decades, also here in China. 
For example, at the start of the new millennium, we were one of the first brands in the world to promote a professional tournament here in Shanghai, the BMW Asian Open.   We continued this commitment to Asia on other levels, and on a global level, we own a portfolio of many pinnacle of events when it comes to golf:   Like our PGA Championship at Wentworth, the home of The European Tour, the BMW Championship in the U.S., and today, and that makes me very proud, we can add the BMW Masters at Lake Malaren Golf Club here in Shanghai. 
And I promise, we are going to do it the BMW way, because as the No. 1 leading premium brand in the world, what we would like to generate is an unparalleled premium experience.   So here we once again would like to underpin our claim as leading partner in sport in general, and golf in particular. 
So in order to meet our own standards, our own premium standards, we have spent many, many months in planning every little detail of the Masters.   Because whatever we do, our goal is to be creative and our goal is to support the respective sport we are engaged in, providing a special experience for our guests. 
This particularly applies to the spectators, players, media partners, and officials and frankly speaking, I don\'t know whether we are the biggest sponsor in golf, that\'s not of relevance.   What we certainly want to be is the best partner, and the best sponsor.   It\'s a matter of quality, not quantity.   We are really proud that so many of the professional golfers appreciate this. 
We enjoy a long and quite positive relationship with many of them, and we are proud that we are able to welcome some of them here, many of them here in Shanghai.   Nearly all of The Ryder Cup Members, winners, and it particularly gives me pleasure having the world\'s No. 1 player here, Rory McIlroy and his victorious teammates, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer, they are going to be here on stage with us shortly.   But at the end of the day, just like making cars, we work with partners to bring it all together. 
So I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone in golf to make this happen here.   Our presenting partner, Lake Malaren Golf Club Shanghai, our main partners, Hugo Boss, Rolex and Ballantine\'s, and our suppliers and partners and I would like to thank our long‑term partner The European Tour and the China Golf Association; thanks a lot for your support in staging this tournament here in Shanghai. 
And last but not the least, I would like to sincerely thank all of the authorities of the municipal government level of Shanghai and Baoshan District level, as well as multiple games and administrative centre, thank you for your ongoing support. 
So in a nutshell as the name indicates, the BMW Masters will play an important and great and integral part in our global golf strategy and as a long‑term commitment to Shanghai.   I really look forward to the tournament and thank you very much. 
THE MODERATOR:   Talking about the tournament itself, without further ado, I\'m going to call up my friend and also tournament director Marco Kaussler, if you please, and our Tournament Director of BMW Masters here. 
I know that due to some constraint, many people across here are really, really interested and eager to find out the details, so I\'m just going to go straight forward to the essence of the questions here. 
First of all on day one, that is, Thursday, we know that world No. 1 Rory will be there; who else will be there?   Please, give us some input.
MARCO KAUSSLER:   Yeah, I think it\'s one of the strongest fields I have to say here at the inaugural BMW Masters with Rory, Luke Donald, Justin Rose and Lee Westwood, we have four of the world\'s Top‑5 here at Lake Malaren.   We have 11 of the 12 Ryder Cup members, the winning Ryder Cup European Team Members, and then 28 out of the Top‑30 in The Race to Dubai.   I think those numbers underline the strength of this first BMW Masters and are really looking forward to great competition. 
THE MODERATOR:   Totally star‑studded. 
So my second question is, you know these players pretty well from inside out in many ways, and on the other hand, your inside tips, if you will, who might have a shot, as well.
MARCO KAUSSLER:   Well, with such a strong field, it\'s really almost impossible to tell.   I think the guys that took a break after The Ryder Cup are probably hungry to come back.   Maybe a little bit rusty, but to mention one name, I think wouldn\'t be fair. 
What I\'m looking forward is actually to see how our local Chinese players are doing.   We hope that they will bring their AGame to compete with the world\'s best and hopefully put on all together a very good show here at the BMW Masters. 
The MODERATOR:   We understand many of players are very happy with the course and the conditions, and the weather we talked about, as well; what about the situation of the hole‑in‑one; we know BMW has some good and generous prizes on offer, please.
MARCO KAUSSLER:   First of all, I think what I\'ve heard, Mr.Shi and your team, you can be extremely proud of the course.   All of the players that I\'ve spoken to, they are extremely happy with what they have seen.   You can be very proud of your course and also of all the team behind. 
There\'s not only the prize money, $7 million that they are playing for, a whole lot of money, but there\'s always a little bit of luck involved. 
So for the first player to actually have a hole‑in‑one on 17, there is a BMW 640 Gran CoupÃ©, for me personally, probably the nicest product that I would like to have. 
We have given three hole‑in‑ones away this season, so why not a No. 4.
