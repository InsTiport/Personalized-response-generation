 Q.  Such a great event?  
BRIGITTE THIBAULT: It's such a great event that I can't really complain, and it's different conditions, so I'm just still learning through the process, so I went with what I had.  I had fun, so in the end, I'm happy.   
 Q.  So what's the feeling going into the practice round tomorrow?  
BRIGITTE THIBAULT: I'm actually so excited, because I never -- the Chairman's Dinner was my first time to Augusta, so I'm obviously so excited.  I just saw No. 1 off of those pictures, and you know, it was so different that I can't wait to play and see how it feels, and have a well known caddie to maybe take notes for next year and things like that.  So just getting ready and just trying to get better one day at a time, so I'm excited.   
 Q.  What's the feeling going back to school after an event like this?  
BRIGITTE THIBAULT: I'm definitely missing school, so it doesn't really feel like I'm at school, but I mean, this event is so incredible.  It's just, you know, on top.  So obviously you're going to have that, eh, when you go back to no caddies, but that's where it all starts, anyway.  So it's good to go back to your basics, so I'm excited to go back to my team and play conference.
