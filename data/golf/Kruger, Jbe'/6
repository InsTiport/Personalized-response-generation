 Q.   What was going through your mind at the stage of the front nine?   
JBE' KRUGER:   I didn't play very well.   I didn't have my rhythm there.   Didn't do it as good as I did the last couple days and couldn't make enough putts.   I knew there were a few not easy holes.   
But I just needed a couple of good shots and you never know.  
   
 Q.   When you were starting on the front nine, you could see some lower number there's.   Were you looking at the leaderboard at that stage?   
JBE' KRUGER:   A little.   No, you always know they're going to shoot low.   It's a big field.   They won't go backwards.  
   
 Q.   What changed for you on the back nine?   
JBE' KRUGER:   Concentration, as always.   It's probably the main thing.   I find if I take a second or two longer, I know I can concentrate a bit better.   I just started to do that.  
   
 Q.   Two shots going into the last day.   It's a great position to be in?   
JBE' KRUGER:   Exactly.   I think, yeah.   One shot at a time.   We'll see tomorrow.   The good Lord knows what he's doing.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to try to keep the same game plan tomorrow?   
JBE' KRUGER:   Yeah, I think I'll probably want to play more like I played the first couple of days.   I think the key is the fairways to the greens.   Take it around the greens.   If you can putt for birdies, it's always better on the final day.  
   
 Q.   That's what you can do, fairways to greens?  
JBE' KRUGER:   Yeah, I've been hitting it probably as good as I've been hitting it the last four or five months.   So I'm actually feeling confident.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to go to the range and do any work?   
JBE' KRUGER:   Not at the moment.   I'm a bit tired.   I think I'll hit a few putts and I'll get out of here.
