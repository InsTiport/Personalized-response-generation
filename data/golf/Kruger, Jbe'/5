Q.   Can you just reflect on the round today?
JBE KRUGER:   I played well.   I think I actually played the best I played all week, just couldn't get a putt in.   They always say the guy that makes the most putts is going to win.   I think I had probably 34, 35 putts.

Q.   You were in position this weekend.   Do you think it was a good experience playing with the PGA TOUR guys?
JBE KRUGER:   It's never the winnings, it's always about the experience.   You can't buy experience.

Q.   Were you watching the leaderboard out on the golf course?
JBE KRUGER:   I like to know what's going on.   It encouraged me to make a few more birdies. 

Q.   Was there one point you thought that you'd actually win this?
JBE KRUGER:   Well, probably up until 15, 16, and then I saw he was 23 or 22â€‘under par, and that was it.

Q.   You had two eagles?
JBE KRUGER:   Actually I made one.   I hit it to about the front edge and I made a long one.   And on the 3rd hole, I made a good putt for eagle. 

Q.   How long was the putt for eagle?
JBE KRUGER:   Probably about 20 feet. 

Q.   Are you in China next week?
JBE KRUGER:   Definitely.   I've been struggling a bit with my form, and I'm slowly getting it back, so I'm looking forward to it.
