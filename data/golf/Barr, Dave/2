Q.
How do you feel about your game play today?  You seemed to play well today?
DAVE BARR:  Well, it was sporadic at times.  You have to be hitting the fairways.  And that's the problem.  I missed the fairways.  And I really paid the penalty at 11 there.

I could only get a pitching wedge, maybe 60 yards and 70 yards to hit it out of the rough there.  And I was lucky, I hit a 6 iron from about 187 yards between trees and made my par after that one.  But it was so tough and wiry in the rough that you get it in there and you got no place to go.  You can't even think about going for the green, unless you get in such a ball sitting up like a ball on a tee, you know.  But probably just try to keep on the game plan of fairways and greens, fairways and greens.  And try to be patient, because you know the scores aren't going low.  So the key is being able to play off the fairways.  Because you can use the driver a lot because you're not getting any roll and they will stay in the fairway most of the time.  Then when you do hit a green, then hit it in there close and just take your share, take advantage of some of those close birdie putts.
