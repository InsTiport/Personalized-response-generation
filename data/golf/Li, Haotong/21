Q. How would you sum up this afternoon?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, played really solid.  Especially had a couple up-and-downs and was quite happy to shot 8-under on this course.
Q. That was a lovely way to finish on 18, as well.
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, actually that tee shot wasn't too good.  Left it high on the face.  Surprised it was on the fairway.  When I got down there, I was quite lucky, second shot gets on the green, easy four.
Q. What did you do particularly well today?
HAOTONG LI: Well, I just want to play by myself and play my game.  I mean, I thought if I just stayed patient, I'll play good.  So just stayed patient all day.
Q. How much did you enjoy that with Rory?
HAOTONG LI: Well, first time so far, and it was quite a great experience, so very enjoyed today.
Q. What impressed you the most about his game?
HAOTONG LI: Just very comfortable today and make a lot of putts obviously.  Very comfortable this round.
Q. How much are you looking forward to tomorrow to what is a massive title on The European Tour?
HAOTONG LI: Well, I've never been this this position before, so it's going to be fun out there tomorrow.  Hopefully I can do my best out there and have some low scores.
