 Q.  You nearly finished that back nine the way you started it with an eagle.  How did you find it out there generally today?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I think I've played the back nine really good the last couple days.  Even pro-am, as well, which is quite happy to see I can finish with a score like that.   
 Q.  Front nine has been a bit punishing for some of the players, especially frustrating.  You had that evil lip-out for par on the sixth.  How are you going to approach the front nine?  
HAOTONG LI: Well, to be honest with you, today on the course over there, wasn't my best again over there.  Front nine is more like hanging in there, which is what I did, which is pretty good.  A bit unlucky with that par putt.  But today pretty much cost me two shots off two the tee shots.  Other than that, I played okay.  Yeah, again, playing solid.   
 Q.  We're only into the second tournament of the year after a break.  A lot of guys are still trying to dial in parts of their game.  I think they were especially jaw dropped by the -23 you scored when you won this last year.  Do you have an idea what you need to do tomorrow?  
HAOTONG LI: Well, definitely need to make some nice birdies out there.  Actually my putting has been getting really good because since I worked with Phil Kenyon this week, so quite surprised to see the feeling around the green.
