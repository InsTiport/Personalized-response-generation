Q. How satisfying is this win?
HAOTONG LI: Well, it's amazing.  Today he didn't really give me many holes as yesterday.  So it's a tough match against a tough guy to beat.
Q. Two good wins now.  What has been the key so far?
HAOTONG LI: I mean, I've had some bad positions today, but I just felt I stayed patient.  I did that very well.  Lose a hole doesn't matter.  Keep head up.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HAOTONG LI: Even I win 15 and 16 and 17, I still felt like the worst is I'm going to be half, I get a half point.  But it's better than I thought.  Driver is great.
Q. Two wins now, your destiny is in your own hands.  Last match tomorrow against Tom Lewis.  How will you approach tomorrow's match?
HAOTONG LI: I think my game is being improved day by day.  So I just want to play my best again over there and see what happens.
Q. I was talking to the EurAsia Cup captain last year, and he said you were so suitable for match play.  What is it about match play that you so much enjoy?
HAOTONG LI: I just feel nothing to lose.  If lose a hole, play the next one.
Q. Congratulations.  Good match against Brooks Koepka and a win.
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it was incredible.  Didn't expect that.
Q. How do you like this match play?  How did you like going out and playing a match play round rather than stroke play?
HAOTONG LI: There's less pressure, actually, at some points.  And especially when you have a bad hole, you always can play well on the next one and get something back.  So you just have to hang in there and do your best.
Q. It's not an easy golf course, especially when the wind is blowing.
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it is very tough today, and I holed some inside ten-foot par-putt.  I think those putts helped a lot today.
Q. So tomorrow you've got a chance for another victory and getting into the knockout stages.
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, that would be great.  I'll try my best.
