Q. How much are you enjoying yourself so far this week.
HAOTONG LI: So far, so good.  Make a lot of putts and, well, especially from last week, recovery.
Q. Was that rust last week?
HAOTONG LI: Just got sick and cannot focus on the game.  Feeling not great.  But this week was quite fresh and yeah, game is in good shape.
Q. How pleased were you with your finish?
HAOTONG LI: It's very exciting because I think only make one par on the back nine and played decent.  Only had bad three shots.  Looking forward for the weekend.
Q. How excited are you by that weekend, being in contention as you are?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it's very exciting.  Looking forward to the next two days.  Hopefully play solid and play some low rounds out there.
Q. What's in particular has pleased you most?
HAOTONG LI: I think I've been putting very well.  Off the tee was really good.  So kind of helped a lot.
Q. How was the fog delay this morning and how did you cope with that?
HAOTONG LI: Actually, I saw another Chinese player play really well today, and actually quite helped us because we stayed in the player lounge and played PlayStation quite well.  So it was fun.  Just had a lot of time to relax.

HAOTONG LI: Definitely, for sure.  FIFA.
Q. Score?
