Q. Still a great week.  You should be proud of yourself.
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, especially through yesterday, it's pretty good.  Just couldn't focus today.  Like I said, run out of energy.  It's very good experience.
Q. What can you take from a week like this competing against the best players?  You beat Noren, you beat Koepka, going to the Sweet 16.  What can you learn from this?
HAOTONG LI: If I play my best in golf I can compete in everything, with everyone.  So just have to work hard and get my game going.
Q. Considering the late finish yesterday, how difficult was it to try and come back out here and compete at your highest level?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, just tired.  It's a lot going on, a lot.  Tough time.  You need to go through and focus.  Just need -- it's hard to focus.  Just need to do better job next time.
Q. I suppose losing some of the early holes to Kevin put your back against the wall?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I had a couple of bad mistakes.  I mean, you can't do that in match play.
Q. Looking forward to the Masters now?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, yeah, especially going to play next week.  It's very good to prepare.
Q. In Texas?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah.
Q. What are you looking forward to next week and how do you prepare for the Masters?
HAOTONG LI: Just play golf.
