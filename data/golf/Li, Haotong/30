 Q.  A disastrous start today but you showed so much heart, it was spectacular.  What will you take from today's round?  
HAOTONG LI: First five holes gave me a lot hard time.  But lucky to make a lot of birdies on the back and get a lot up-and-down.   
I think today is like most up-and-down of the year.  I mean, pretty lucky, and thank you for my fans support me always.   
 Q.  You were Player of the Year a couple years ago, PGA TOUR China.  Explain to us what that meant for you now coming to the PGA TOUR?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, that means -- that changed my life actually.  If they don't have PGA TOUR China, probably still play in China right now.  Very thank you for China Golf Association and PGA TOUR China gave me a chance.   
 Q.  And this year, your first year on the Web.com Tour.  How did that help prepare you for today?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I mean, you know, I played there the whole year, and almost every week, big pressure for me.  Rookie always tough for myself, so it's pretty good, keep card, so hopefully next year play well there.   
 Q.  How nervous were you standing on that first tee today?  
HAOTONG LI: Actually, not really not that nervous.  I just hit some bad shots but it's too bad.   
 Q.  Your target coming into this tournament was Top-10.  You've got that.  You must be very happy.  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, I mean, incredible for me this week.  Hopefully play well next season.  This for me is very, very big.   
 Q.  The way people treat you here is like a rock star.  Give us a word about the fans who have come out to support you.  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, they support me a lot and thank you very much for the support all week, every hole follow me and support me.  So very, very thank you.
