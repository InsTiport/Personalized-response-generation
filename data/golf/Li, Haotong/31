Q. What are your thoughts on the third round, a nice, successful one?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I mean, I never thought I could play that good.  Played very good today, very, very -- can't believe.
Q. Why did you have doubts?  Why didn't you think you could play that well?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, because after yesterday second round, I think must be a lot of people watch me today, and yeah, it is a lot of people watch me the whole 18 holes.
So just always tell myself, take it easy and relax.
Q. And that was a very special start, wasn't it, all those birdies in a row?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I never start like that, first time.  So very, very exciting.  Still can't believe.
Q. What do you think with one day to go?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, I mean, tomorrow must be a lot of people will play very well.  And my target is to stay top ten, that's it, and hopefully I can be right there.
