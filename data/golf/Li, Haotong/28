 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
HAOTONG LI: It's been very solid, especially compared to last week.  I only missed one green today and had so many birdie chances, and also catch a few times, was really good today.   
 Q.  You say compared to last week, so what's made the difference?  
HAOTONG LI: Oh, I think everything is different.  It's more enjoy this week, more relaxed.  So hopefully keep the same feeling for next couple days and hopefully play well.   
 Q.  More relaxed, because?  
HAOTONG LI: Nice result.   
 Q.  Lovely sunshine and lovely part of the world to be.  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, definitely better weather here, and a lot warm.   
 Q.  And do you find that there's so much more attention on you when you're at home and people expecting things?  
HAOTONG LI: Right, right.  People expectations of me very, very high last week.  Hopefully next year play well there.   
 Q.  How do you adapt to the different courses from Sheshan to here at the Carya course?  
HAOTONG LI: I think here it's a lot dry, way dry than Sheshan and weather is way better.  Greens just been really, really smooth.  So make some putts today.   
 Q.  Do you like this kind of course, a kind of resort course, even though it's not just easy?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it's kind of narrow fairway, but if ball-striking very solid, you can shoot really, really low here.  I think I can do well here.
