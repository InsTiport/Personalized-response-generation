Q. First of all just comment on your round today?
HAOTONG LI: Well, I played quite solid except first hole and a couple of shots.  I holed a lot of putts and played solid the whole day pretty much.
Q. Talk about the conditions out there on the golf course?
HAOTONG LI: It's a little bit softer than I expect, and especially the fairway.  Didn't have any roll on that.  So it's going to play a little bit longer than normal.
Q. Talk about the circumstances of having your dad on the bag.  Is this his first time?
HAOTONG LI: Well, when I was young, my dad caddied for me the whole time.  But definitely tougher and my own caddie is there.  But especially I come here way earlier and my dad said, Can I caddie for you?  I said, Well, it's going to be a hard decision, but he just want to change something for me like probably bring some Chinese luck, good luck.  Yeah, works.
Q. How do you think he did today?
HAOTONG LI: He did pretty good.  Did pretty decent job.  And I think tomorrow it will be better.
Q. I know you played a practice round last week with Mr. Nicklaus, I believe.  Talk a little bit about that experience?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it's such a great honor and very lucky.  I saw him on the course and he come to me, which is nice.  And we talked about my game and this course.  It's very helpful.
Q. Any advice he gave you?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, he said don't be shortsighted on this course.
Q. And were you nervous?
HAOTONG LI: Definitely.  I didn't really play -- he didn't really play, but he just come walk a couple of holes with us.  So it's very cool thing.
Q. Something you'll remember for a long time?
HAOTONG LI: Oh, yeah, for sure, forever.
Q. It is your dad's first time at a TOUR event?
HAOTONG LI: No, no.  PGA Tour China.  Definitely it's been a while, since probably 2015 or something.
Q. Is it the first time at a TOUR event, though, PGA TOUR?
HAOTONG LI: No --
Q. Which one?
HAOTONG LI: Last time he was in, I think actually it was BC.
Q. You didn't fire your caddie, he's coming back?
HAOTONG LI: No.  He will be there at the U.S. Open.
