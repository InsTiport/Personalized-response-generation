 Q.  Good battle with DJ?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, very good match, especially front nine playing really good. Yeah, back nine, just a little bit off, and I mean, just like I said, wasn't my best over there today again.  But I learn a lot and especially that last few holes was good for me.  I think he deserved to win this event.   
 Q.  Of course you had the chip-in on 9.  Good way to finish with nine holes?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, for sure.  Like I said being in last the couple days, again, wasn't being that solid, and iron always pulled it out, as you can see.  Very pleased I can play like this with the ball-striking.   
 Q.  Would you say your best shot was your second shot on 15?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, yeah, so far, this week, that was a great shot there.   
 Q.  You must be happy with your performance to come second?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, for sure.  Because when I had four holes left, I looked at leaderboard.  I was dropped to third place and very happy to finish solo second this week.
