 Q.  Good to finish in second spot?  
HAOTONG LI: It's fantastic for me.  I think I already do my best, and just like I said yesterday, only top five is really, really good for me.  Actually today is quite a surprise for me because back nine, I don't know, just shot like 5-under, something like that.  Yeah, great round.   
 Q.  It looked quiet early on, as if nothing would happen for you and suddenly it was birdie, birdie, birdie.  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, actually when I make like four birdies in a row, after the fourth one, I thought, really, I make four birdies in a row.  I said, wow.  Yeah, pretty good day.   
 Q.  And how is it when you're playing alongside David Horsey, who is obviously really scoring right from the start.  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, actually he's a really solid player.  Just missed a couple holes, missed a couple shots, he played really solid.  Also Matteo, also enjoyed that.   
 Q.  This is very nice for ranking points and prize money, you won more than you did for the China Open.  
HAOTONG LI: Really?  Wow.  Probably can get some gifts.  Cool.   
 Q.  Does this mean your game is in tiptop condition?  
HAOTONG LI: I think still need relax for every week.  Don't be like, try too hard, like last week.  It's kind of getting way better this week.  Got a lot of World Ranking points and a lot of money, especially (laughs).  Cool.
