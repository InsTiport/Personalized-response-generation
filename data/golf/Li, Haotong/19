 Q.  Heaviest trophy you've ever had to lift?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, especially I don't have many trophy in the home.  I was quite happy to lift that heavy thing.   
 Q.  Describe your emotions right now.  
HAOTONG LI: Emotion:  Happy, incredible.   
 Q.  The way you finished off that round, is that some of the best golf you've ever played?  
HAOTONG LI: So far it is.  I just didn't realise I could make that putt on 15.  That was huge.  I think that was the turning point.  And especially on 18, didn't realise I would make that one, either.  Was quite happy and just happy.   
 Q.  The two-shot swing on 10, what was going through your mind after that?  
HAOTONG LI: Honestly that was a very poor shot.  I hit four days in a row down there.  And especially take an unplayable, just bad course management and waste a couple shots.   
 Q.  Having bogeyed 10 and 12, you must be very proud of the way you fought back to win this tournament.  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, I just want, I think most of the time, only two or one behind, so I just want to keep pulling myself in a position and just don't go too far away.  Quite happy with what I did.   
 Q.  To win this tournament and play with Rory in the final round, just describe that.  
HAOTONG LI: It's incredible to play with him.  Learn a lot of experience from him.   
 Q.  Did you ever pinch yourself on the back nine there?  
HAOTONG LI: Well, not really.  Just play myself and make some putts, like.   
 Q.  Ultimately, you believed in yourself down the stretch?  
HAOTONG LI: I don't really know.  I believe I think my game is in good position now, and especially after this week, it gives me a lot of confidence back, especially last week, missed the cut.  So never been in this position again.  Just want to be myself and play some decent golf in the future.
