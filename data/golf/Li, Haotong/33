 Q.  What are your thoughts on a 69 today to move up to 9-under par?  
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, it's a pretty good start on the first five holes to make three birdies.  Actually still lose some chance, but last hole was a very good up-and-down for bogey.   
 Q.  Was it more difficult with the wind picking up?  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, I think when I turned to the back nine, my back nine, it was more tough because the wind starts getting stronger.  So it's pretty tough back nine.   
 Q.  Do you look at leaderboards and see your position on that board now?  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, almost every hole.  Very cool, very fun there.   
 Q.  Lovely, isn't it, going into the weekend knowing you're in such a lovely position.  There's so many other guys below you.  
HAOTONG LI: Yes, very interesting.  Exciting.
