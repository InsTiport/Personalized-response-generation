 Q.   Feel pretty good about the way you finished?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   Overall missed a lot of putts today, but just happy way I played today.  
Satisfied.   Excited going into tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What kind of confidence does i give you having beaten Brittany Lincicome and Gee Chun, the two major champions, in you first LPGA start last fall?  
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   I learned a lot from the playoffs I played against Lincicome and Gee Chun last year.   Also, Gee Chun won the tournament last week at U.S. Open.   
I believe I haven't made it to the next level yet, so hopefully this week gives me good confidence going into tomorrow.   Hopefully I step to the next level.  
   
 Q.   The weather delay obviously was not an issue for you today.   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   I was really exhausted.   I actually fell asleep during the delay.  
I stayed with couple other friends that we always hang out, and we actually cheered against each other, so...   
   
 Q.   Have you and Ha Na had a lot of battles in Korea on the KLPGA before becoming rookies this year?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   Yeah, we played against each other a lot.   We grew up playing for Korea as well, for national team, so about ten years played against her.   
Yeah, we have a pretty good friendship.   Played a lot of events against each other.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel getting ready to go into tomorrow one stroke off the lead?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   Just one shot behind Ha Na, the main focus for tomorrow is to keep my temper down and try to stay calm and play as best golf as I can, as possible.
