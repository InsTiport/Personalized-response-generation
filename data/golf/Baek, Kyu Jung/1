Q. Feel pretty good about 5‑under?
Q BAEK: I missed a couple of fairways, but then I putted really, really well today. Finished at 5‑under and had a really good score. Especially long putts, I did very good. 

Q. In contention the last two weeks, feel good about your game is at? Keep climbing this year. 
Q BAEK: The last two weeks, I felt more comfortable every time I played every week. When I play, the other players help me a lot and make it more fun and give me more friendship, so that makes me feel comfortable that I could play better every two weeks from now. 

Q. Did beating Brittany Lincicome and InGee Chun, does that give you confidence, seeing them win major championships, that you could win this week? 
Q BAEK: Yeah, when I won the Hana Bank Championship, I felt much more comfortable coming into the LPGA. But all this season, I never thought like it's really that much competition on the LPGA; it's a more higher level than I thought. But I still figured out my shots every week and I improve it, so that makes me more comfortable and then I can play a little better every week now. 

Q. Did you play a lot against InGee growing up, and what's your relationship like?
Q BAEK: Yeah, I learn a lot from them when I was young and we always competed with each other. We grew up and playing the third and second tour, as well. 

Q. What does it take to win on this golf course? What does it take to win the British Open here at Turnberry? 
Q BAEK: Try to avoid the bunker as much as you could. And then come down every hole‑‑ if I feel comfortable, I can hit it much better, so that's what I'm looking for. 

Q. Are you nervous? 
Q BAEK: Well, yeah, it's a major tournament. Not really. (Laughter).
