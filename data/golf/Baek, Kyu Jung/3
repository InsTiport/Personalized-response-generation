 Q.   Coming out four straight birdies, 18, 1, 2, and 3, what went on during that stretch?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   Missed a lot of birdie opportunities earlier, but I was able to sink a couple putts which were a bit of a distance from the hole.  
For that, I really gained confidence from there and made four birdies in a row.   
   
 Q.   What was the longest one?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   About nine yards from the hole, nine to ten steps.   Pretty lengthy putt.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel then with a good round today going into the weekend?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   Played last week at the U.S. Open with great players.   I learned a lot from them.   Had a good experience there.  
I have something that I am really focusing this week, so going into the weekend really, really looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   The two and a half hour delay bother you?   
Q BAEK:   (Through translation.)   I needed a couple more hours to sleep in, so actually helped me.
