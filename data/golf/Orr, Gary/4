  Q. How do you cope with conditions like that?   
 GARY ORR: At the start, the first hole was a driver and a 3-wood, you just have to do your best. I got off to a good start, and if you get off to a good start it gives you a wee bit of something to hang on to.  
  
  Q. Yesterday, driver 3-wood --  
 GARY ORR: Yesterday I drove it in the bunker. Normally it's a drive and a mid-iron or something.   
  
  Q. In good position now.   
 GARY ORR: Yeah, good in shape. It's a really nice course, a nice, old traditional links.   
  
  Q. You don't get many on the Tour.   
 GARY ORR: No, it's enjoyable. A really nice layout.   
  
  Q. This is a later start than unusual for you?   
 GARY ORR: Not really. I don't play often at the start, play a few and start trying to play a bit in the middle you know.   
 I play the three after this.   
  
  Q. You don't play much because you like to take a good winter?   
 GARY ORR: Yeah, I need a break in the winter. It's all right when you're starting out, when you're a young lad, you can play as much as you like but once you've played for a while, you need to have a good break, otherwise you just get fed up, put the clubs away.  
  
  Q. Put them away all together?  
 GARY ORR: Put them away for a spell, six weeks or so.
