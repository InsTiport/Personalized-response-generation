 Q.   How were conditions?   
GARY ORR:   Condition were nice this morning on the front nine but then the wind came on, when we got to the 13th, 14th, came pretty heavy and it's exposed out there, as well.   But eased off which I was thankful for.   
   
 Q.   Is that the best you've felt, these last two days?   
GARY ORR:   I've been playing okay without really putting it all together.   But driving it pretty consistently, and this week I'm driving it well and holing out, also.   
   
 Q.   Feel of a major this week?  
GARY ORR:   Feels like I'm playing The Open.   It has that kind of feel with huge crowds, and all enthusiastic.   
   
 Q.   Did you play this course before?  
GARY ORR:   I've not played it before, no.   First time.   Really enjoying it.
