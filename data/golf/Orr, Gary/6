   GARY ORR: Pleased with that. I started off pretty well. Holed a nice putt for a birdie on the first and birdied the par 5 and I was 3-under after 6, so that was a good start and carried on from there.   
  
  Q. Off to St. Andrews tomorrow; that will be a tough test.   
 GARY ORR: I think it's going to be windy tomorrow, so it will be different from today.   
 I saw the forecast and the one I saw, but every day is obviously different course and you just have to take your conditions and do your best.   
  
  Q. How do you assess your season so far?   
 GARY ORR: I've been playing okay. I had a decent run through August and beginning of September, some good finishes, so hopefully I can carry that on to the end of the season.
