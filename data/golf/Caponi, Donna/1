Q.
You're thoughts so far how this morning is turning out?
DONNA CAPONI:  First when we said to the print media and live television that we needed the crowd help us, it was a totally different atmosphere.  The players feel it.  All of a sudden on the range they're playing great.
Q.  Big dilemma when Cristie Kerr came up lame, you substituted with Michele Redman, we doubted that.  It looks like it's paying off.
DONNA CAPONI:  The night before, Michelle said she didn't sleep well last night.  She had a solid eight hours sleep.  When we knocked on her door and said, "You're going," she said, "I'm ready."  She was jumping up and down and that's exactly what we want.
Q.  When Lopez and Caponi come calling, you better be ready?
DONNA CAPONI:  Absolutely.
Q.  Congratulations, thanks for talking with us.
