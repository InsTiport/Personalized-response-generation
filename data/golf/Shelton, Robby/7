 Q.  Did you feel you made the birdie putt at No. 18?  
ROBBY SHELTON: I did. It is just hard reading these greens, really late (in the day) like this. His (putt) went a little left and I was at a different angle but I still thought it would sneak a little left.   
 Q.  Did his birdie attempt have a bearing on how you read your putt?  
ROBBY SHELTON: A little bit. I definitely watch his and I knew mine was little straighter. I thought I had a good line and just missed it.   
 Q.  What?s this day been like for you?  
ROBBY SHELTON: I have had some similar times, like the U.S. Open, but this is just a different environment. They (spectators) are always cheering for you or for GB&I. They are always around the greens and the tee boxes. It?s just really fun.   
 Q.  What was the one thing that you learned today?  
ROBBY SHELTON: You just have to keep fighting. I was 3 up and then 1 down, you just had to keep fighting the whole way.
