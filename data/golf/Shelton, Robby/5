 Q.  Robby, able to get it to 7-under par and a great finish here at the 18th rolling in that birdie.  3-under for the day and 7-under for the championship.  
ROBBY SHELTON: It was a good day.  Started out a little shaky.  Doubled the first hole into the wind.  Pretty tough.  But I handled it well and continued to play 5-under after that and once the wind died down it was real easy.   
 Q.  Just your fourth event of the year and come up with your great scores in the first two rounds.  Where did it come from?  
ROBBY SHELTON: I don't know.  I played Q-School last week and I won it.  Lot of confidence after that.  I'm just hitting it well and starting to roll it again.  That's good.   
 Q.  How are you feeling about the weekend after what you were able to do after first two rounds of the Valero Texas Open?  
ROBBY SHELTON: It feels great.  If I continue what I'm doing, it's going to be a great weekend and hopefully it's special.
