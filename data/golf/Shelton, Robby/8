Q. First of all, your opinions after two days of stroke play?
ROBBY SHELTON: Yeah, I mean, I was just trying to make it to match play, and I did that.  I left a lot out there, but hopefully I'm saving them for match play.
Q. What in particular is maybe a little bit bothering you right now?
ROBBY SHELTON: A little bit of putting.  I had all pars on that back nine, and I just missed a lot of short ones, but I'm hitting it well, and that's a positive.  That's good.
Q. You're experienced with playing in Amateurs and obviously had a great summer.  What can all that do to help you as you enter match play?
ROBBY SHELTON: Yeah, I mean, I played well in match play last week in Western and at the Palmer Cup and all that, so I'm experienced with it and I know how it is.  I mean, it's just -- you've just got to play your game.  Unless you get a hot player that's playing really well, that's the only way hopefully somebody will beat me.
Q. When you play match play, do you play your opponent or take care of your own business?
ROBBY SHELTON: I take care of my own business, but if he's messing up, then I play against him on the hole just to beat him on that hole, but most of the time it's just me playing my game.
Q. Obviously you played on the North Course yesterday.  How do you see that course setting up for match play?
ROBBY SHELTON: I mean, it's perfect for match play.  I mean, it's a ball strikers' golf course, and that's what I'm doing well right now.  You can't really putt your way around that course, so I like that.  I mean, it's just a really good course to play.  It's hard, long, wet, so it'll be fun.
