 Q.  Steady Eddie, but you had to be aware of a couple 62s out there and a 59. What was the round like with those things in mind?  
ROBBY SHELTON: Yeah, coming down the stretch I saw that there were some low numbers. But, you know, I started out 1-over through three. I just kind of wanted to just get my game back where it was yesterday, and I did that. I had a lot of good looks. You know, some putts fell in the back nine, and it was a good day honestly.   
 Q.  I love that yesterday you admitted to the fact that it was difficult to sleep because you're making your PGA TOUR debut as a member. How do you get comfortable when you are experiencing some of those nerves?  
ROBBY SHELTON: I don't know. You just got to relax and tell yourself to relax and just take a lot of deep breaths. That's really key out there honestly.   
 Q.  Are there points specifically in the round that you remember you were starting to maybe get a little ahead of yourself?  
ROBBY SHELTON: Not today. I did really well with that. Just I was doing really well playing smart to my spots on the greens. You know, it's been a really good iron week, and hopefully can carry over to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Being comfortable tied for lead at this point heading into the weekend and the kickoff to the season, what are you going to be focusing on, paying attention to, in order to keep this spot?  
ROBBY SHELTON: For me, just being patient with my swing, my mind, everything. Just got to stay patient out there and just hit fairways and greens.   
That's key for me. If I do that, it's going to be a great weekend.
