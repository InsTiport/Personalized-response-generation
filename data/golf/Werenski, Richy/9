 Q.  Richy, the score keeps getting better each day here at the Wyndham Championship.  How did you do it today on a Saturday?  
RICHY WERENSKI: I hit the ball pretty good today.  Last two days kind of felt like the ball-striking was so-so, making some putts and saving myself.   
Today, I hit the ball really good so I gave myself a lot of chances.   
 Q.  How about the excitement for Sunday, not only trying to chase down your first win on Tour but to solidify your spot in the Top 125 and the FedExCup Playoffs?  
RICHY WERENSKI: It's huge.  The goal this year at the start of the year was to get to East Lake and I can still do it.  I still have a goal.  We'll see what happens.
