  Q. Can you recap your round out there today?
 RICHY WERENSKI:   Grinding.  I grinded pretty well today.  I haven't been getting off the tee very good this week, but I'm finally starting to make some putts, hitting my irons pretty good.  So if I can figure out how to get off the tee the next couple days it should be a good weekend.
