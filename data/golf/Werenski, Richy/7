 Q.  Best finish in over a year. What worked this week and why?  
RICHY WERENSKI: You know, I putted pretty well all week. Today I didn't putt good. Just the greens got really fast, kind of baked out. Just really couldn't get the speed. Just kind of kept hitting everything too hard. Was missing everything just a hair low.   
Making good strokes, but, you know, for the most part I had a solid putting week. Really didn't hit the ball very well but just kind of scraped it around. Did the best I could.   
 Q.  Was there a moment or two on the back nine where you realized you probably wasn't going to catch Niemann?  
RICHY WERENSKI: I really wasn't thinking about it too much. Yeah, probably like on 15-ish, 16. I think he birdied 16. Yeah, that was about where I would say maybe.   
 Q.  A lot has happened with your career over the last two months. What does this result, first event of the PGA TOUR season, change any goals for you going forward through the fall and new year?  
RICHY WERENSKI: Not really anything. If I won would've been a different story, but, no, doesn't really change anything at all.
