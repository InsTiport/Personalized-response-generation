 Q.  I know you're disappointed in the finish, but if you can just talk a little bit about the entire experience today?  
RICHY WERENSKI: Yeah, it was a good day.  I really was playing pretty crummy in the whole first nine.  You know, just couldn't get anything going, like, hitting good shots but couldn't make any putts.   
Then I had an eagle on that 14 or 15 -- 15.  And then that kind of got me going a little bit.  That was big.  And then it really just felt like every other day out here.  Lately I feel like I'm playing pretty good.  It's only a matter of time I'm back in this position.   
 Q.  What's going through your head right now, just coming off that playoff?  I know you're disappointed in that one shot you had on that second hole.  
RICHY WERENSKI: Yeah, I thought I hit a pretty good second shot in here and had a little adrenalin going, hit it a little further, took a bad kick, couldn't really tell where it landed.  And didn't think it was going over the green.  And then I hit a bad chip on top of it.   
So, obviously I'm pretty I'm bummed.  Not a good feeling.  Could have locked up my card.  Probably now I've got to do some more work, but whatever.  I'm not worried.   
 Q.  What was this atmosphere like being out there in the playoff?  
RICHY WERENSKI: It was good.  It was definitely -- haven't experienced it before.  I think it's going to help me learn for the next time I'm in a playoff.  I can just build off of this.   
 Q.  Did you hit driver off on both playoff holes?  
RICHY WERENSKI: I hit 3-wood the first time, driver the second.   
 Q.  Seems like you were you a little further back the second time than the first time?  
RICHY WERENSKI: First time I was further back.  Second time I was further up.   
 Q.  I know you're a little bit disappointed right now, but if you can, just talk a little bit about the playoff there and your entire week.  
RICHY WERENSKI: Playoff was pretty good.  I mean, I made a good putt on the first hole to keep it going.  So I was happy about that.  Didn't really feel like I hit a bad shot until the chip on the second playoff hole.  You know it happens.   
I'll learn from this experience and take it to the next time I'm here.  The week was really good, solid, felt like I really could have played a lot better.  I think everybody always says that.  But I know I definitely don't have my best stuff, but my game is trending in the right direction.   
I've got one more tournament, Wyndham, hopefully play good there and lock up the card and on to next year.
