Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  Oh, good.  I played pretty solid round of golf.  So I was pretty happy.  I played    the holes I screwed up, bogeyed 16 and 17.  17, I did everything I was trying to do and still did it wrong.  Fair enough, Pinehurst beat me there.  And 16 I kind of flinched in the fairway.  I didn't know they were teeing off behind us and kind of came out of a 7 iron, because it's a pretty routine shot compared to what we've been doing today.  I'm fortunate, but I had my share of good breaks today.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  Where I was on the 16th and they were on the 18th tee.  We thought they had gone, and right in the middle of when I timed my back swing, I didn't think anyone was there, and it was behind my back, so I came right out of it.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  Oh, certainly.  I mean, he can, I'd rather be sitting here at 4 under, 5 under, because it's going to be tough to stay there.  Yeah, disappointment, but it's a long day.  We had a nice flow and everything going for about 14 holes.  And 15, 16, 17    it took us forever.  I think it took an hour and a half to play the last four holes, just standing out there.  That was kind of tough, too, just waiting    made it a more difficult day.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  I think earlier in the day there was.  This afternoon the last six holes, you really    I mean I had an L wedge from the middle of the fairway forward and I barely kept it on the green by one foot.  I don't know how you're supposed to do it.  You land it short it's going to go off the side.  We got to kind of our limit this afternoon of not being able to keep a ball on the green.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
BRANDT JOBE:  For the last five holes to go, six holes.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  Yeah, I mean tomorrow morning, obviously that rough, it's only going to grow.  That stuff is brutal.  But the greens will be a little smoother, maybe more receptive.  Maybe have to    I hope they'll put a little water on them.  Get out in good, fresh conditions will be nice.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  If you had told me before I started if I'd take it, I would have taken it.  Obviously I felt like I should finish better, and I didn't.  At the same point in time, anything under par out here is a real good score.  Obviously I don't know how many guys were under par, but doesn't look like too many.  You kind of have to be    the 2 unders or 3 unders were both in the morning rounds.  It plays more difficult in the afternoon.  But I'm happy.  It's a good start, but there's a ton of golf to be played.
Q.  How many times a day did you put yourself in a position that you felt (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  Fortunately    well, I missed it today, I missed it in some pretty decent places.  Obviously 16 is not where you want to be.  There's a foot of sand in the bunker, there's no way you're going to get that up and down, at least I'm not.  That was obviously    a couple of times obviously hitting it in the rough, you know, there's a couple of times that I couldn't think about, I missed the fairway by three inches, and I couldn't think about hitting it a hundred yards.
Q.  Do you remember which hole that was?
 BRANDT JOBE:  12, a hundred yards to the front of the green, 80 yards to carry the front bunkers, and I couldn't do that.  I'm three inches out of the first cut.  So that was kind of bad.  But around the greens I was kind of fortunate, I hit enough fairways, so that helps.
Q.  Talk about Rocco Mediate at and Olin Browne, going through some tough times.  Can you give your thoughts about the guys that are up there?
 BRANDT JOBE:  Rocco and Olin are obviously solid players that they kind of    you know, they're not going to probably kill you with their power, but they've been out a long time and good players, and both have a lot of experience in Opens and major tournaments.  And they're both capable of playing some solid golf.  We've obviously seen that.  That's a course where you have to get it in the fairway first and think about everything else second.  And those guys do a good job of that.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
BRANDT JOBE:  I like that.  We're still excited.  I don't know, it's nice to be playing.  We've sat out for almost a year.
Q.  How would you feel about Sawgrass hosting a major championship, U.S. Open or
BRANDT JOBE:  I don't think they will.  We had THE PLAYERS Championship there.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 BRANDT JOBE:  I think that course was more or less designed to hold that one specific tournament, so I don't know that you'll see that.  That tournament will live there forever, and that will be that.  I think they're happy with that.
