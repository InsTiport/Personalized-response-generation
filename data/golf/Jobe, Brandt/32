BRANDT JOBE:  I'm having a little trouble with the hand.  I didn't know if I was going to play or stop or go, so I'm kind of still waiting to see what happens.  I had surgery back in July.  It hurts on the strangest things, hitting drives and putting, the two things needed the most out here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BRANDT JOBE:  I was rooting for him so hard.  I thought that was great.  The guys that have gone overseas in all different directions have worked hard to get out here.  And to go and do what he did so quickly I think really showed him and showed a lot of us that you play hard, and you've got the game to do it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BRANDT JOBE:  I'm getting older and mellower now.  You know, it's like anything.  I had my chance a couple of years ago when Charles ended up winning.  I hit some good shots and just didn't win.

I've had a couple of other chances, but other guys have played better.  So I just really haven't had a tournament where I've gotten every day together.  I've some good finishes on weekends, like last year at Colonial.  I haven't had a tournament where I've had everything going.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BRANDT JOBE:  You know, it's been a while now.  I'd love to have the opportunity, that's all I can say.

Those last four or five holes that you play here, you couldn't play harder holes that do more to your mind really than anything.  It's the ultimate challenge, that's for sure.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BRANDT JOBE:  Well, I started up today, and I told Stick in the trailer, it might be nine holes, it might be three holes, it might be 18, so as long as I can keep doing it, but I had an MRI yesterday, and I've just got to figure out what's wrong.  And this week if I can play, great, and if I can't, I can't.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BRANDT JOBE:  Well, it's something different.  There's so many things that have little tears and things that came out yesterday, that we're not a hundred percent sure what it is.  But I want to get healthy again.  It's been a while.
