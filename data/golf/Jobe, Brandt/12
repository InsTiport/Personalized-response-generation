 Q. Birdied your last four holes. Obviously gotta be feeling good about your round. Projected now to be 65. Gets you a job for Chicago. Just a few comments about the round and how much was the FedEx Cup and making that move inside the top 70 on your mind? 
 BRANDT JOBE: You know, for me, starting the week at 56, it was more of losing it than it actually would be of gaining it. I just didn't play well this week, the whole week. Struggled to make the cut, and the last two rounds were a struggle. So it wasn't a very fun week on the golf course. 
 Certainly didn't have any game that I could think of. But it was kind of funny: I looked on the board and I found myself at 77. And I said I don't want to finish 77th this week and then I started thinking I wonder where the points are. I said forget it, let's try and make a couple birdies coming in. Fortunately birdied the last four so that was good.
