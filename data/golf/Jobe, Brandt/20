  Q. Kind of a comeback Thursday. I just saw John Daly shoot 67. I saw you shoot 67. The old days are back.  
 BRANDT JOBE: Good for the old guys.  
  
  Q. Yeah, tell me about it.  
 BRANDT JOBE: I got off to a good start. I birdied the first three holes. Kind of hit a low, couple of bogeys. Finished up the front nine with a couple of birdies.   
 I just played pretty solid. Had a good par save and birdied the two par-5s on the back.  
  
  Q. Lot of tight fairways, your caddy told me you did a lot of good escaping from this deep rough?  
 BRANDT JOBE: I tell you what, I've never seen it that deep. The fairways are narrow, and the rough -- man, we had some lies literally six inches off the fairway and had to chop it back to get it into play. So that's as tough as I've ever played the North course.   
 I mean, at the same time, it was in the best shape that it had ever been in. The rough was just in some areas -- I found the tough areas, let's put it that way.  
  
  Q. It used to be two shots easier. Do you think they're about even to what you've played in practice?   
 BRANDT JOBE: I think when the North course plays firm, it's tougher to hit the fairway. We were all talking about that.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about your game as you head to the South course for Friday?   
 BRANDT JOBE: I've been playing fairly solid this year. Just haven't gotten four solid rounds or five solid rounds together. So I'm just kind of plugging away, and hopefully doing some good things. We'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. You've got one, let's go get two?  
 BRANDT JOBE: One down, three to go.
