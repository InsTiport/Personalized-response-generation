CHARLEY HULL: I feel like I've been playing great all season, like I put a lot of good work in over Christmas and over new year, so I feel confident in my game, and I feel like I'm in a good place outside of golf, as well.  Like with my friends, I feel like that helps me relax on the golf course, also.   
 Q.  Seemed like you did everything you could do to win this golf tournament.  What are your emotions like right now?  
CHARLEY HULL: I'm happy because I played some great golf on that back nine.  It kind of started from the ninth hole where I made birdie there.  I'm happy.  I feel like I can -- I know I can play well under pressure now when I have to get it going, I think, so it kind of helps me with that, making birdies in when you're down, and that's what I kind of did out there today.  I'm happy I holed that putt on the last, and I'm proud of myself.  It feels great.  Lydia hit a great shot into the last, and she should be proud of herself.   
 Q.  Being so close in a major championship, what's your takeaway from the week?  
CHARLEY HULL: I think it's great.  I can't wait for my next tournament.  I'm going to take three weeks off, but I'm buzzed for the rest of the season.  I put some good work in over Christmas, so I feel like so far this year, I've had quite a few top 10s and been quite competitive.
