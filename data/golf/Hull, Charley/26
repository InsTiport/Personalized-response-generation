 Q.  Outright second place.  You'd have probably taken that at the start of the week.  
CHARLEY HULL: Well, it would always be nice to try and win it but I gave it a go good.  I played well on the back nine today.  Just didn't hole a few putts, but I'm happy with my round.   
 Q.  On 15, you birdied to get within two.  What were your thoughts at that point?  
CHARLEY HULL: Try to birdie coming in.  I hit a decent tee shot.  Was in the drainage ditch and had to drop it in the first cut.  Hit a really good pitching wedge to the green and couldn't manage to hold it, and then it was a weird lie.  I was in like a little bit of a divot on the 16th green and then chipped it and nearly holed the putt.  Oh, well.  I'm pretty happy with that result.   
 Q.  So close and yet so far.  You played really well all week and great fun being in the thick of contention --  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  I've been playing pretty well so far this season.  Had a bit of a quiet spell through like the Women's British Open and stuff and I feel like my game is in really good condition.   
 Q.  In Gee played well in the group in front of you.  Were you aware of exactly where you were?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not really because the scoreboard on 16 was actually broke down so I couldn't really get a look at it.  I didn't look until the 17th, but it was only a hole but I knew I was a couple behind.  She played really well.   
 Q.  What events left for you now?  
CHARLEY HULL: I'm playing Shanghai, then Japan and then CME.   
 Q.  Obviously being this close to a win again, clearly you have a win in your sights before the season is over?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.  I've had a third this year and now a second and quite a few Top-10 places, so hopefully, yeah, it's around the corner.
