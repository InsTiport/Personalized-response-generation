Q. You come back for the halve but it has to feel like a win the way you finished.  How do you feel like the day?
GEORGIA HALL: I think we played really well and we were 3-down at one point so to get back with a halve we're very happy.  And it was great that the other team won.  So it was a really good day today.
Q. I don't know if you know how close you came to the winning that BMW but --
CHARLEY HULL: I know, yeah.
Q. What did you hit?
CHARLEY HULL: I hit a 6-iron and it was about right pin and it was a tricky pin to actually get it close there.  But yesterday my boyfriend, he was out with me and he said, oh, it would be nice if you could get that car.  And I looked up today and saw it and it was quite funny.
Q. Were you able to see it?
CHARLEY HULL: I didn't see it lip out, but I saw it going near the pin.
Q. It actually hit the pin.  How far was it for the 6-iron?
CHARLEY HULL: About 180?
Q. What was the mindset for you guys going into like the 16th hole winning?
GEORGIA HALL: We just had to go for everything and make sure we didn't leave a putt short and try and hit it far off the tee and we know the par-5s we hit it maybe slightly longer, especially Charley, than our opponent, so I think we had a good chance going down 18.  And Charley holed a really good putt on 17 to keep it going.  And then I hit it to like two foot with my pitch and we were really happy.
Q. How long was the putt on 17?
CHARLEY HULL: About 15 foot.
Q. Seeing your teammates come up afterwards telling you that they had won their match, how good of a feeling is that on 18?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it was good.  I think I saw earlier in the round that they were up and it's good to get one and a half point.
CHARLEY HULL: It was a good match.
