Q. In terms of scoring, what would you say par is out there today?
CHARLEY HULL: I'm not sure really.  A couple over but I felt like I played quite well today.  Like I hit really well.  I felt, like I played pretty good.  I was missing my putts.  It's one of them things.  But I thought I played pretty good.  Solid.
Q. Yesterday obviously it was also a difficult day.  Do you feel like this is really good in terms of preparation for next week, as well?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.  I'm struggling hitting a couple of low shots I feel because my wrist still hurts low shots hitting down, so I'm trying to ride the wind.  Makes it tricky.  But I was getting used to it, so now I'm getting my confidence up.  Just one of them things.  The golf course is quite firm, so when you hit down on it, it does hurt a little bit.  But I'll be all right.
Q. We saw you yesterday flexing your hand.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it hurts in positions, like it will hurt if I'm hitting down on it, or it will hurt if I'm like getting something out of my golf bag, didn't even think about it.  It's weird.  It's one of them things.  It's near the end of the season, so I'll be able to rest it after Solheim or something.
Q. Do you still think of winning this tournament when you're 5-over?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly, because I thought I hit it really, really good today, really solid.  So I feel confident now.
Q. You started the day at 5-over, were you thinking about the cut mark or were you thinking you can challenge?
CHARLEY HULL: I was just thinking of staying in there because I knew how windy it was and I like playing in the wind when it's like that.  I feel like I like to battle.
