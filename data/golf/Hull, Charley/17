 Q.  Charley, Azahara, obviously been a very good day for Europe. How are you feeling coming off 18?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: Obviously it's a bit upsetting that we only got the half, but we played great and they played great down the stretch, so there's nothing you can do about that. They made really, really nice putts coming in.   
And Charley actually played amazing coming down the stretch, had a couple really bad lip-outs. But we are super proud because we played some amazing golf today.   
 Q.  Charley, there were a couple moments, especially that last putt on 18, where I guess you thought it might have snuck in.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I thought I had it, just hit the right lip, and the hole before, I hit it pretty close about four feet and that lipped out as well. I didn't hit my driver very good today, so I'm happy with the way my irons went. And a half ain't too bad, is it?   
 Q.  Not too bad. How are you feeling about the position at the moment?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think it's great. I think we've been doing amazing. Obviously we could have snuck in a little more at the end, but we should be super proud and we're still on top. So that's a really good result.   
 Q.  Well played out there today. Azahara, how would you sum up that match this afternoon?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think it's some amazing golf. Both teams played really, really good golf. And at the beginning we made amazing putts and really good birdies and they had a really strong finish. But we should be super proud of ourselves because we played some great golf and nothing you can do when they make putts like that.   
 Q.  Charley, yourself, how do you see it?  
CHARLEY HULL: Well, yeah, I didn't quite hit my driver how I wanted to, but my iron shots were pretty good. A shame about 17, I lipped out there, and for the win on 18. But I'm quite happy. Not too bad.   
 Q.  Azahara, how would you assess your day today?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: I think it's great. Every time you're on top is a good day. We've got a nice lead right now, so we are going to be happy.   
 Q.  Charley, what a match.  
CHARLEY HULL: It was good. As I said, I didn't hit my driver very good at the beginning. I managed to get my irons to post, those last few holes, into wind. But a halve's not too bad.   
 Q.  Azahara, when you were 4-up you must have thought the match was yours?  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: You can never think that, but we were -- were we 4-up? Yeah, we were 4-up. I mean, you never know coming down. They are really good players, the same as us, and you can make lots of birdies. And they did at the end. And we didn't quite manage to make birdies, but we still played really good golf and a half point is really good.   
 Q.  You played so well.  
AZAHARA MUNOZ: We both did. Charley at the beginning didn't play that great, but I was there for her. And at the end she played amazing. She made some really nice couple of birdies, making long putts. And I think we made a really good team.   
 Q.  Charley, overall quite a great day for you.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yes, it has. Gotta get to bed.
