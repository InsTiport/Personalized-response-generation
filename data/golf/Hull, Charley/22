Q. A 4-under round, you're tied for the lead going into the final round.  How much fun was it out there today in front of those galleries?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was fun.  It's great to see big galleries like this because it makes you have to play well because they are a pretty tough crowd to please.  But no, it was good fun playing with two great players, as well.  I really enjoyed it.
Q. What were conditions like out there today? Three birdies for you on the front, nothing working coming home until the last for you.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was good.  The conditions were pretty good, scorable conditions, and like the first day.  I felt like I was playing pretty well.  Played decent on the back nine, very steady and nice to finish with a birdie.
Q. The putt on 17 looked as though you would make that one.  How did that not drop?
CHARLEY HULL: I know, exactly.  Actually finished left of the hole and nearly went in the right lip and my caddie got up there, it was a great putt and that's all you can do is hit good putts.  I'm happy I made birdie on the last.  Hit a great shot to the green, hit 4-iron and hit it quite high.  Needed an extra in order to carry that bunker otherwise it would have been bunker, but I'll settle with that four.
Q. We spoke yesterday about you not having won on the LPGA Tour since the 2016 CME.  Still 18 holes to go.  What would a second win on this tour mean to you?
CHARLEY HULL: Obviously it would be great.  I think any win's good, but it would be great and I'm just not even getting ahead of myself.  Just one step -- one step tomorrow.
Q. Very cool playing in the final group.  Obviously you knew exactly what was happening at the top of the leaderboard and it was basically the three of you for the most part of the day exchanging hands at the top?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I don't really look at the leaderboard to be honest.  Yeah, I just played steady and I think tomorrow is going to be a fun day.
