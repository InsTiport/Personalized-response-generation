 Q.  Charley, what was so good about today?  
CHARLEY HULL: Just kind of kept in the zone.  I felt like I hit it pretty decent, better than I did yesterday.  I holed a few putts and got up and down when I needed to.   
 Q.  Are you surprised about the way the leaderboard has shaken out?  You shoot a really low score and people at the top have sort of come back.  
CHARLEY HULL: I haven't actually been looking at it too much.  If I look at the leaderboard I'm just like staring into space sometimes.  Yeah, I don't know.   
Like today it was scorable out there.  I don't understand why everyone has dropped back.  Obviously it is tricky little golf course on some shots, like 18.  You've got a good finishing hole.   
I'm happy with my score and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  You struggled on day 2.  Anything that you worked on heading into the weekend?  
CHARLEY HULL: No.  Just go on the range and hit some golf balls and just kind of worked on my tempo.  Sometimes it gets a bit rushed.   
No, just kind of keep it to the basics.  Remember what my coach said.  I haven't had a golf lesson in six weeks, so I looking forward to having one when I get home.   
 Q.  What was it that your coach said?  
CHARLEY HULL: Well, he didn't actually say anything to me.  I was just remembering what he said in the past.  Kind of keep on top of that.   
 Q.  What is your mindset going into tomorrow and a chance to win this tournament?  
CHARLEY HULL: Just as another normal round.  Just keep in the zone.  Keep on quite straight in my tempo.  I lose concentration so quickly.  Like with school, everything I lose concentration.   
So keep in the zone and keep eating on every couple of holes.  Yeah, about that really.
