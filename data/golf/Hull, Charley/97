 Q. 1‑over start today. You find yourself a good few shots off the lead as we speak. Assess your opening day for us.   
CHARLEY HULL: Well, I actually feel like I'm hitting it pretty good off the tee, apart from the shot I hit I think on the 17th. I blocked it right there. I just didn't putt very well today. But I did hole a few short ones under the pressure which was pretty good. I just kept like closing my clubface a little bit.   
But I feel like my short game is pretty tidy and feel like I'm hitting it well enough. Just not quite getting my distances right on my clubs at the moment.  
   
 Q. We talked earlier about that game as a nine‑year‑old when you won an amateur title here. Are the memories of that around this course, is it similar to how you remember it?   
CHARLEY HULL: Well, yeah, the golf course, like some holes, like the ninth and the 10th, I remember them kind of holes. But I can't remember much of the golf course until I came back here. No, I'm happy with the way I played, and just keep on thinking of those good memories.  
   
 Q. Strategy for the next couple of days? Obviously we know what you're capable of. You had a 66 at Birkdale. That's obviously got to fire you up.   
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely. I'm out early tomorrow and feel like I'm hitting it well enough. Them putts are going to drop and I'll go low hopefully.
