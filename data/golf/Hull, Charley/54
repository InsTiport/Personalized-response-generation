Q. A really good round again today.  Can you talk about your highlights?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played pretty solid.  I'm happy the way I played.  I left quite a few putts out there actually.  A lot of them was on the edge of the hole but again, another solid day at the office.  Got a little bit wet out there.  I thought it might thunderstorm but it didn't.  Had a few rain showers.  But at the end of the day, we finished on time, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow's round.
Q. When it rains like that, how do you --
CHARLEY HULL: It's hard because I don't wear my waterproofs because it's too hot.  It's kind of like you just get wet and just run back under your umbrella.
Q. Do you think the reason some of your putts weren't dropping was because of the rain?
CHARLEY HULL: Probably but they was just on the edge like that, either side.  I was reading them good.  Sometimes you don't have the luck of them going in.
Q. And when that happens, you don't feel -- it's not quite disappointing?
CHARLEY HULL: Because you know I'm hitting good putts.  I have been the past couple weeks actually.
Q. Can you remember when you remember playing with Morgan Pressel?
CHARLEY HULL: At Lytham, yeah.
Q. Talk me through your best hole today?
CHARLEY HULL: Probably it was 16.  I hit a really good drive and then I hit a 3-wood on to the green and I 2-putted it for birdie.  My drive and my 3-wood were pretty good because there was water down the left and I had to be quite precise.
