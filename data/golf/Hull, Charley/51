Q. How are you feeling?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I felt good out there today.  I played pretty solid.  You know, I had quite a lot of putts that had a good chance to make the hole and that lipped out, but apart from that, I'm happy with the way I played.
Q. 9 was the nice long one downhill.  How did it feel?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it felt good.  It was a wicked long putt there.
Q. How do you take this into tomorrow after this grind today?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  You never know what can happen.
Q. I have to ask, how is the wrist feeling?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it feels good.
