Q. How did it go out there today?
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, I hit it well.  It's just a shame.  I had mud ball on every hole and it was just full of mud, I have no control over where the ball is going.
So just a shame really, because I would have scored a lot better in the third round and today if it was pick and place.
Q. So you had a lot of time off yesterday afternoon.  How did you spend the day?
CHARLEY HULL:   Just went to the gym and got a pizza.
Q. Nice.
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.
Q. What was your overall takeaway from the week, and how was Champions?
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, it is great.  Lovely.  I love the golf course.  Great golf course.  Like I said, if it was pick and place I think it would have been so much more fairer.
