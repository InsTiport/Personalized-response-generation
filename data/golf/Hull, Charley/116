  CHARLEY HULL:   I can look back on my year and I've done really well anyway.   I've had a lot of Top‑10s, so it's been good.  
   
 Q.   Can you move up the leaderboard pretty easily tomorrow.   
CHARLEY HULL:   I think I'm in like 10th position or 11th position, so not sure, yeah, so it's good.   
   
 Q.   Just on 9, what happened exactly?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I just hit my second shot in the water.   
   
 Q.   It was just the wind took it?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, just turned over, yeah, just the wind, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Was that one of your strengths, to focus day by day?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, just take it shot by shot.   
   
 Q.   Is it important for you to stay grounded, to be sort of pragmatic about it all and not think about Rookie of the Year?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, it's important, because at the end of the day, I think the shot at the last, I was there and I was in the rough and I thought to myself, I could hit it in the water but I could get it over‑‑ I thought, it's just a game, so I thought, I'll just go for it, and I got it and it was good.
