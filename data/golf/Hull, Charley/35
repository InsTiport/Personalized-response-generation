Q. Could you just kind of sum up the day for us?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played pretty well.  I drained some long putts here in the middle of the my round and the beginning as well.  Missed a couple coming in, but I felt like I was playing pretty solid.  But it's a shame the last (indiscernible) on my third shot, but I managed to have a good two-putt.  So I finished with a good putt and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. How do you like your position?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I actually like it a lot.  I think I'm only three behind the lead now, so that's not too bad.  So I think it's a good position, actually.
Q. Has this been something you've been pointing to?  Do you feel like you're ready?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I feel like my game is in good position.  I've put a lot of good work in over the winter.  But it was quite strange over the winter I took three weeks off because I sprained my ankle, because it snowed in England and I slipped over in the snow.  But I feel like the three weeks has done me good and I've been just practicing really hard.
Q. So you weren't able to practice as much?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly, yeah.  I was a bit annoyed because I did it the day I came back from Dubai, because I played in the Dubai tournament, and I played good out there, and I landed and I slipped over in the snow.
Q. Was there any particular shot or highlight of the day for you?
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know, really.  I felt like the one I nearly holed from the shot into the green, I think it was the 12th or the 13th hole.  I made a good shot there and spun it back to about that far.  So it was decent.
Q. There are a number of players on that leaderboard looking to make their first win in a major championship.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.
Q. What do you think of that?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it's good.  I've come second in this event before, and I feel like I've had some experience, so I feel confident.
