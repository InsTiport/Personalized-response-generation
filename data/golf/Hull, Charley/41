 Q.  Talk about your day.  
CHARLEY HULL: I'm hitting it pretty decent, and I feel like I'm just playing good golf.  I like this golf course, so I always have good memories of it.   
 Q.  What is it about this golf course that you like?  
CHARLEY HULL: I played it since I was 15 or 16.  That was my first year as a pro and as an amateur.  And I just enjoy it.  I think I have good memories of this whole place.   
 Q.  Normally 7-under after 36 holes might even be the leader, but there are some great low scores out there.  Why is that?  
CHARLEY HULL: I think the golf course is in great condition this year.  I think it's pretty, like, perfect.  I think you can hit a good putt and they'll go in, so, yeah, it's good.  I don't know, I just keep on digging away and hopefully get a low score.   
 Q.  Any thoughts about Pernilla?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, she's playing great golf.  She's hitting some shots.  She pretty much got up-and-down when she needed to.   
 Q.  Do you feel like at this point in your career when you're at a major it's second-nature to you, or do you still get a little amped up?  
CHARLEY HULL: No, I'm getting used to it now.  It's fun, I like it.   
 Q.  You don't get nervous at all out there, Charley?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not too much.  You get a little bit nervous on the final day, but not really, no.  Once you're going, you're going.   
 Q.  One of your countrywomen Jodi Shadoff is up there as well.  I don't know, is there some weird thing about British players playing well?  
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know.  I don't look into that.  Mostly just like the golf course.
