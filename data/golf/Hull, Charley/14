 Q.  Tough pitch there at the end. Describe the complexity in your emotions right now?  
CHARLEY HULL: I feel pretty happy, to be fair. I think I was 1-down with about five or six to play, so to halve the match is not too bad.   
But the last hole was pretty sneaky where my second shot finished. And the greens are -- pretty unfair green where the pin is. I hit a good first chip and it just checked up a little bit too much on that bank. But it just rolled down. And obviously she hit it stiff, so I had to go for that putt.   
But, yeah, I'm pretty happy with the way I played. I'm pretty happy with the way I played. I feel I had a (indiscernible) putt on 17 as well.   
 Q.  You played beautifully coming down, after a couple down early on. How much did you stay in the moment out there? How aware were you of the overall situation?  
CHARLEY HULL: It was good. First hole -- well, she birdied the first two holes and then I left a few birdie chances out there. I think I missed three short putts, so that was a bit frustrating -- for birdies.   
But I managed to hole a few on the back nine. I feel pretty happy. It's good.   
I don't think people on the TV can understand the severeness of this 18th green.   
 Q.  Coming off 18, did you consider half a point won or half a point lost?  
CHARLEY HULL: I just consider it as half a point. I feel like I played pretty well out there. I think I was 1-down or 2-down entering the back nine. And then I brought it back. So I'm quite happy with that.   
I felt I had a putt on 17 to win the match, but it just lipped out. And 18, that was pretty sneaky (indiscernible), too.   
 Q.  The way the weather has gone, you had really tough matches, but you've come through. How do you sum up what you've done?  
CHARLEY HULL: It was pretty good. I didn't do much putting when I was at home. (Indiscernible) poorly. I only played six holes in the past three weeks, so coming into the Solheim Cup I didn't feel like -- the first few holes I wasn't in too much form, but on the back nine I reeled it down and I feel like I played pretty well.   
 Q.  Tough week ahead of you.  
CHARLEY HULL: I'm looking forward to it. It should be a good week. Should be fun.   
 Q.  How are you reflecting on that half point?  
CHARLEY HULL: I'm quite happy with it. I feel had my putt on 17. It lipped out. And then that was pretty sneaky on 18.   
 Q.  It's a very tough finishing hole, isn't it?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yes, it is. It's a pretty unfair green to be fair. I don't think on TV you can quite realize how the slope is on it. But Megan hit a great chip in, and then I had to go do my chip at the hill -- foot of the hill.   
 Q.  The week overall, how would you sum that up?  
CHARLEY HULL: Pretty good, I think. I was happy with it. It was good. Looking forward to next week now.
