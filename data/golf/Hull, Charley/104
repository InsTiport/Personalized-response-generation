 Q.   Pretty good round until the 18?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I actually hit a pretty good shot into 18.   The wind really gusted when I hit that shot.   It was gusting anyway.   Hit a half 9‑iron and only had 195 yards to clear it and usually hit my nine about 132.   I hit it a lot less than a full one, but it was quite strong going into that green.  
   
 Q.   To that point you were really flying.   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah I was 4‑under until then but still finished 2‑under which isn't too bad.   What am I, four, five off the lead, so that's nothing at all.  
   
 Q.   You saw what Shanshan Feng did this morning.   Did you go out there thinking, you have to match her or at least get close?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I didn't really‑‑ I wasn't looking at scores too much on the golf course but she had a good round and she played yesterday afternoon with the wind picked up and she shot low this morning.   Yeah, it's a good round and hopefully I'll be playing with her tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Heading into the weekend, still on course for winning the Order of Merit?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, well, Gwladys is playing great at the moment.   It's not over yet and I think she'll definitely finish in the top four because she's playing really good.   So I'll have to dig deep tomorrow.
