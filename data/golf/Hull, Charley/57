Q. Happy with that?
CHARLEY HULL: I'm okay with it.  Like I didn't quite, I wasn't feeling well this morning.  Only took me like 15 minutes to work because I thought I was going to be sick.
No, I'm all right.  I'm happy with it because, like, at the end of the day, the leaders are only like 5-under.  I'm not really too far behind and I've had a couple weeks off and I haven't hit many golf balls at all.  But I'm not too upset with my round.
Q. Is it hard to get going again today after the tragic events of yesterday?
CHARLEY HULL: Well, it was all right, like getting going.  Kind of just put that to the side.  It's such a shame what happened.  But you know, that's life.  I'm really sorry to hear about what happened to him.
Q. What was wrong this morning?  Are you feeling sick, flu?
CHARLEY HULL: No, I just felt like I was going to be sick.  I actually thought I was going to be sick.  But I don't know, I think there's something going around this week.  But I feel fine now, so I don't know why.  I probably ate too much breakfast.
