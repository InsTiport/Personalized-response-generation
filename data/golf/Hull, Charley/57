 Q.  Bit of a sore wrist, and you shot 4 under?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I felt pretty confident out there today.  A little ache, but apart from that, it feels good.   
 Q.  Do you think the break last night was good, that you didn't have to play 18 holes?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it's not a bad thing.  It gave me an extra day to rest it a little bit.   
 Q.  What do you feel was really working for you?  
CHARLEY HULL: I think I'm hitting it pretty solid at the moment.   
 Q.  Conditions were starkly different.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.   
 Q.  Do you take anything from that round into the next?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not really.  I feel like I'm hitting it pretty good, so I'm just going to keep the momentum going, get something to eat now, because we've got a quick turnaround.   
 Q.  Now, with a little bit of an ache, you have to play another 18 on it; any concern?  
CHARLEY HULL: No, not at all.  Cheers.   
 Q.  What was different for you between finishing last night and having that break and playing this morning?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, obviously it's just less windy, but I didn't mind playing in the wind yesterday.  To be honest it was quite fun.   
 Q.  It's something you're familiar with at home?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, sometimes, but I live in the middle of England, so it's not really that windy all the time.   
 Q.  No problems with your wrist or anything?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not really, no, not too bad.   
 Q.  When did you aggravate it?  
CHARLEY HULL: Last Wednesday in the pro-am.   
 Q.  And it's something that's bothered you for a while?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, because like I -- well, I hurt it when I was like 16 when I was at Jay Green's when I was hanging out down there, and the whole time I thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome, but really I fractured the wrist, but I inflamed the fracture last week, and it hasn't healed yet.   
 Q.  Did you feel it today?  
CHARLEY HULL: It's just like an ache, but it's not too bad.   
 Q.  You did it out of the rough?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, last week, yeah.
