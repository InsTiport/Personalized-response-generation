 Q.   You're still in contention but wasn't quite the day you were after today.   
CHARLEY HULL:   I'm actually really happy to be honest.   I got off to a fast start and I was 3‑under through ten holes, and just lost a little bit of concentration for two holes.   I fought back after making a triple and a bogey with three birdies after that, so I'm really proud of myself for doing that.  
   
 Q.   What happened with the triple?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Just bad course management.   My caddie told me to chip out and I was like, no, I'm going for it.   But I'm happy I went for it because I've learnt from my mistakes.   I have to make my own mistakes to learn from them.   So I'm happy‑‑ I'm not happy for making it, but I've definitely learnt and I'm happy I holed like a 50‑foot putt.  
   
 Q.   There's two competitions, really, going on for you this week.   There's the actual tournament itself and the Order of Merit, as well.   The Order of Merit race is still very much alive.   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, I have no clue how Gwladys with getting on.   I'm happy and here to win the tournament and not worry about that too much.   One more day tomorrow, hopefully I can go and play well.   
   
 Q.   Your triple, did you drive into the bushes?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Hit it left, hit it left again out‑of‑bounds.   Tried to chip out‑‑ plugged where I dropped it, hit it in the sand, duffed it, pitched up, holed it.
