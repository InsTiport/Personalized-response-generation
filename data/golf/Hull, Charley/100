 Q.  How big was that birdie on 18?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was good.  I played pretty solid all day today, just made a few bogeys in the middle of the back nine, but apart from that, I hit it pretty solid, and yeah, definitely finishing with a birdie has got me a good feeling for tomorrow.   Q.  How do you power through that bad stretch?  CHARLEY HULL: You know, by making a birdie at the end.  You know, it was just a clumsy three-putt and then I hit a pretty good drive down 16, and it was just the rough was really thick over that side, and it was a short pin, and the bunker shot was just a tricky bunker shot.  Every bunker shot that I gave myself today was a downhill, and you couldn't really stop it.   Q.  The rough has been tough the whole time.  Are you trusting your driver a little bit more or are you just really relying on it?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I'm trusting my driver.  I feel like I'm hitting it pretty good, touch wood, but I'm happy with my game at the moment.   Q.  Are you happy being 2-under going into the weekend?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly.  It's all good, and we'll go from there.   Q.  How do you make up the ground?  It's only five strokes.  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, just by making birdies, hitting greens, hitting fairways and holing putts.  Simple.   Q.  It was quite a sort of up and down day for you.  CHARLEY HULL: Well, I don't know if I would say it was up and down.  I hit it pretty well.  There was just like two holes where I hit -- I'd say I hit one bad shot to make a bogey.  It wasn't nothing too drastic, it was just a pulled 6-iron, but apart from that, I hit it pretty well.  I'm happy.   Q.  Fantastic chip-in on the 9th.  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was a really tricky chip-in.  I hit a great chip there.   Q.  Any other highlights, sort of saves that you did?  CHARLEY HULL: I don't know, I hit a few good drives, as well.  I hit a few good irons shots where I didn't hole any putts, but apart from that, I'm happy with the way I'm going into the weekend.   Q.  And feeling completely refreshed, not jet lagged?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I'm feeling really good, and hopefully it goes on because making this cut and playing well at the beginning of the season in an LPGA events hopefully boosts me up the re-rank, as well.
