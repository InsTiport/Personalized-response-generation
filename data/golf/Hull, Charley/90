Q. So you started out and you just felt‑‑
CHARLEY HULL: I bogeyed the first hole but then after that, I hit a pretty good shot into the first, just went into the bunker but just missed the putt. But I hit it good. 
From then I just kind of rolled some good putts in, hit it close. Hit it really well off the tee. I just felt like I really got it going. 
I know I finished with a bogey but I hit a great drive down the last and I think I hit it that good. It just went straight through the wind and the wind didn't even move it. Finished in the right rough. Hit a great 7‑iron in. Just came up short because the wind was just quite tricky. Looked like I had a flyer lie but it came out pretty dead. Chipped up and just missed the putt. Hit a good putt, really happy with the way I'm playing. Good score in that wind today.

Q. So given you a lot of confidence for the rest of the season; once again, played a major, learnt a lot, being up there. 
CHARLEY HULL: Exactly. To be honest this week, I played it brilliant tee‑to‑green and today my putting‑‑ I was hoping to get my caddie to help me with a few lines with the putts and I was reading it really well. So I'm really confident now.
