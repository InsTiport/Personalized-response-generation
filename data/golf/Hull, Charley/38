Q. Another great round today.  You're 9-under, tied ninth.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played good today.  I actually left quite a few putts out there but then I holed a couple of good ones, so I feel pretty confident with my game.  A low one tomorrow, would be an end to a good three weeks, so it's good.
Q. Do you feel like you got better each week?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, well, I felt -- well, first week I came seventh and last week I came 12th, 13th and hopefully I can finish better this week.  I just feel confident with my game at the moment.  I put some good work in over the winter, so I'm looking forward to what's going to happen the rest of the season.
Q. What will you be doing after this?
CHARLEY HULL: I'll go back and chill Monday and pretty much practice when I get back.  Have a putting lesson and have a swing lesson with my coach.
Q. And your next tournament is?
CHARLEY HULL: My next tournament is Phoenix.  So have a week at home and then I go to Phoenix.
Q. Will you stay out there until ANA?
CHARLEY HULL: Phoenix and then Kia Classic and ANA, so it's a three-week stretch out there.  It's good, I like playing all the events early in the year because I can have a break in the middle of the year because I like being home for the English summer.
Q. Do you like having a run of three?
CHARLEY HULL: I do.  I don't like any more than three because my mind starts wandering and I start missing home, but three is a good number for me.  Two or three is perfect.
Q. Do you find it's getting easier traveling away from home?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it is.  I do miss my friends and stuff at home but yeah, it's worth it.
Q. How are you handling it differently from last year to this year?  How do you look at it?
CHARLEY HULL: I feel like my head is in a good place this year.  I don't know, I just feel good.
