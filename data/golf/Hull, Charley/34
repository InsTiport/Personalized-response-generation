 Q.  Slightly tricky start.  What happened when you turned around?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I just put in a few iron shots at the beginning of my round and I didn't quite hole my putts.  I let it slip on the par-5s, but then after that I kind of got my head into it on the back nine and made some good birdies coming in.   
 Q.  And how did you do that because it's tough when you start in the majors?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it is tough to get it back, especially in a major when you have to hang tough, but I just kind of kept my head down and knew there was birdies out there.  I knew I'm playing well this year and I'm playing well and just foot posted and went out there and made some.   
 Q.  And was there anything in particular that turned it for you?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not really.   
 Q.  That you stepped on a tee and you thought --  
CHARLEY HULL: No.  Just kind of thought to myself, just keep patient.   
 Q.  And the mistakes you made early on, were they just silly mistakes?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, a little bit.  I just wasn't quite feeling -- I don't know, I wasn't quite feeling up to it, and the back nine I did feel up to it.   
 Q.  And you played great on the back nine.  Is there any highlights?  
CHARLEY HULL: I liked my birdie on the last drive.
