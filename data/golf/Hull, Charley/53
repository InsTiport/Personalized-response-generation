CHARLEY HULL: Happy how I played.
Q. Wrist?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it feels fine.  Just a little bit achy but apart from that it feels good.
Q. Get a little bit of a break?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, yeah, I have.  Not quite sure what tee time we'll get tomorrow.  But yeah, bit of a lie-in.
Q. Anything you're going to work on?
CHARLEY HULL: No, I'm not going to practice.  I don't practice after the round usually.
Q. Is there anything that you felt was really working today?
CHARLEY HULL: Mmmm, I felt like I played pretty steady and game is just good all around.
Q. Just a little bit unlucky coming down the last there, which isn't really a fair reflection on a pretty decent day.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I know, I played pretty good out there today.  I'm happy with the way I hit it.  Yeah, just last hole, I was in the bunker.  I hit a pretty good drive.  It just rolled into the bunker.
I hit a pretty good drive.  It just rolled into the bunker.  I had an awkward stance and hit a good shot out of the bunker with my 7-iron and it went out, which was like 179 yards; run out, and it went into the rough where it was a bit unfortunate and it was a hard shot.
But walking away with a bogey, I'm not too upset, because I've played pretty decent and I know I've got another low one in me tomorrow.
Q. That was a long, and I would guess, a testing day.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was.  It was quite long, especially with my wrist.  But it doesn't hurt really too much.  A little bit achy, but apart from that, I feel good.
Q. And that must be a big source of relief because it's one thing to say, yeah, I'm fine, but actually to do it under pressure.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly.  I didn't know how I was going to play this week and so far I'm playing pretty good.  It's been a long day and I'm quite hungry, so I'll go back now.  I'll go back to the gym and get something to eat.
Q. And final thought.  The weekend ahead, you are very much in the mix and that's all you can ask for at this stage.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly.  I'm on that leaderboard and hopefully bump up there on the weekend.
