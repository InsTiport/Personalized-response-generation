 Q.  You've limited mistakes more and more each day. Has that been a contributor...  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it's been really good. I just feel confident. Each day I feel more confident. It's good to be back with my old caddie; we make a good team.   
 Q.  How long have you been with him?  
CHARLEY HULL: This week, but we was together for like three years. We split up last year for a year and then we got back together.   
 Q.  This is the first one back?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, uh-huh.   
 Q.  Kind of back to some familiar ties?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly. We won together in 2016, so it was good.   
 Q.  Take me through obviously being in contention, one and a half million dollars on the line. For you personally, does that bring out more nerves or excitement to go after it?  
CHARLEY HULL: Don't really think about it, to be fair. It's another golf tournament, so it is what it is at the end of the day, the prize fund, a win is a win.   
 Q.  What's the course been like as far as playing to your strengths week?  
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know. Just been in great condition. I really like this golf course. Got some tricky holes. I enjoy it.   
 Q.  Game plan for tomorrow?  
CHARLEY HULL: Just go out there and have fun.   
 Q.  What's it going to take to have a low number?  
CHARLEY HULL: Just same as today: Hit fairways, hit greens, and hole the putts.
