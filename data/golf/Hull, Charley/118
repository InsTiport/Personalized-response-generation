Q.   That was a fantastic round of golf.   From the sixth hole on, you never really let Paula Creamer feel like she had a chance to get back in the match.   Did you feel this kind of a match coming yourself?
CHARLEY HULL:   I felt like I've been playing good the first few weeks into this season, and then I've just kind of let myself go. 
And after the first day, I really got used to the golf course and I just relaxed and made quite a few birdies over the past few days.

Q.   A lot of players talk about pressure in Solheim Cup play, all the hoopla, a lot of cheering.   You seemed totally unaffected by that.   How do you actually feel inside?
CHARLEY HULL:   I didn't really feel that nervous, to be honest.   Because this is how I always look at golf.   I'm not going to die if I miss it.   Just hit it, and find it, and hit it again. 

Q.   So what was with the autograph there?   Did you not have a Paula Creamer ball yet?
CHARLEY HULL:   My friend at home, he's a big fan.   So I thought I might as well get one.
