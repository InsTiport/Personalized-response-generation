 Q.  Another great day.  What did you finish at?  
CHARLEY HULL: I shot 1-under today, so I'm at 8-under for the tournament.   
 Q.  Another solid day.  What was going on?  Take me through 10 first?  
CHARLEY HULL: I just hit one right and I wasn't quite happy with my club.  I should have really hit driver but I hit a good shot down there with my second ball, so I forgot about that.   
But yeah, the last seven holes, I had a birdie chance on every single hole and I could have easily holed all of them.  But I'm pretty solid and looking forward to go into tomorrow.   
 Q.  So what was the best part of today, best part of your game?  
CHARLEY HULL: I just felt like I was pretty solid, my shots into the greens.  Pretty good all over.   
 Q.  What's the goal for tomorrow?  
CHARLEY HULL: Keep, it as usual, just one shot at a time.  Hit it, find it, hit it again.   
 Q.  Playing in the final round, excited?  Is that something that you just kind of thrive on?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I just see it as another round of golf.  So another opportunity that I can go low around this golf course hopefully.   
 Q.  A lot of birdie chances out there, I think that's something you appreciate?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I like it.  It's a fun golf course.  I really enjoy it and it's nice if the wind keeps up and the rain stays, because I enjoy playing in them conditions.   
 Q.  What's it going to take to catch Lydia or put a little pressure on her?  
CHARLEY HULL: Keep making birdies.
