Q. Thoughts on your opening round here?
CHARLEY HULL: I played pretty good today.  Just a shame about the 18th hole which is my ninth.  Hit my 3 iron down there and hit a sprinkler and bounced it 40 yards into the bushes at the back.  That's how I made double.  I had four birdies on the trot before that.  I got into momentum and that happened.  A bit of bad luck there but I played pretty solid all day to be honest.  I'm pretty happy.  I'm working on some things for the new season, so I'm buzzing.
Q. What are those things?
CHARLEY HULL: Just working on fading and drawing it quite a lot on my tee shots.  Doing that now so I'm pretty happy.  Got some different clubs in the bag and just some swing changes and stuff.
Q. Coming into this tournament, how did you feel you were playing?  Pretty happy with your game?
CHARLEY HULL: I played pretty well.  Had a good like last five weeks, apart from CME, but before that, I was playing pretty good.  So I feel quite happy with my game.
