  CHARLEY HULL: I'm pretty happy with my score. Felt like I was hitting it pretty well and I gave myself plenty of birdie opportunities.  
   
 Q. A couple of lipouts, 13 and 14, a bit frustrating?   
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly. I hit two great shots in there. They are two quite tricky holes but I made a good par putt on the 15th hole and obviously I could have birdied the last three holes in, but at the end of the day, I'm pretty happy with that score. It's good.   
   
 Q. Are you being aggressive out there?   
CHARLEY HULL: I'm just playing my own game. I don't know if I'm playing aggressive or not. I just play what I do. Do what I do.   
   
 Q. Before you went out, is that the sort of score you had in mind?  
CHARLEY HULL: I didn't even look really too much to the leaderboards. I did have a look a little before I went out, but nothing like‑‑ wasn't really thinking, oh, what I've got to shoot. I was just being a bit nosy.   
Apart from that, I'm happy with my score. I birdied the first hole and it was quite a birdieable hole, but it was pretty cool to say that I birdied the first hole in the Olympics that I played.   
   
 Q. Birdied three of the four par 5s.   
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it's good. Like I feel I'm playing well.  
   
 Q. The leader, you don't want to let her get too far ahead?  
CHARLEY HULL: I've been brought up with Lydia a lot in amateur golf and we've been playing a lot together. But she's a solid player and I've got a lot of respect for Lydia. She's a good girl.   
   
 Q. Are you feeling much pressure, or after Woburn, is it nice?  
CHARLEY HULL: Not really. It's nice to come to an event without the buildup or the pressure like at Woburn. I felt a lot of it and I felt like I performed quite well considering what was going on. It's quite nice to come to an event. Still a little bit of pressure, but I'm enjoying it. It's good fun.  
   
 Q. Treating it like a major?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly. It's a big golf tournament. You don't get to respect Great Britain every year, so it's good.
