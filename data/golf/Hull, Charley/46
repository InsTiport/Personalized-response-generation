 Q.  How did you start with a double?  
CHARLIE HULL: I hit a pretty good drive and I was going for the green in two and just topped it in the water because it was in a bit of a downslope, a bit of a bad lie, but apart from that I played pretty well.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you were going to have a chance to be potentially in contention tomorrow when you entered today?  
CHARLIE HULL: Pardon?   
 Q.  Did you even feel like you'd have a chance to be in contention tomorrow when you started today?  
CHARLIE HULL: Yeah.  I thought I was hitting it pretty good.  I hit it well yesterday and could have been like 8- or 9-under yesterday literally because I didn't hole many putts.   
But today I holed a few more putts apart from the 1st hole.  But, yeah.   
 Q.  What's your strategy going into tomorrow?  
CHARLIE HULL: Hit it, find it, hit it again.   
 Q.  Be aggressive, attack, make birdies?  
CHARLIE HULL: Yeah, exactly.   
 Q.  How does last year's experience help you through tomorrow?  
CHARLIE HULL: Yeah, kind of anything can happen.  I won here last year, so just kind of -- just keeping that --   
 Q.  You may win two in a row.  
CHARLIE HULL: Be pretty good if I did.   
 Q.  You feel like this is a course you're comfortable on, confident?  
CHARLIE HULL: Yeah.  Last year -- I believe the first year I played on it I wasn't comfortable on it at all.   
It's not much of a golf course that I usually feel like I play well on, but I'm just playing good golf, so it's good.
