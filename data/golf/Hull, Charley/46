Q. Fourth round 70, 8-under total.  Tell us about your week, your feelings.
CHARLEY HULL: I feel like I played pretty good this week.  Didn't actually really hole much at all.  Today I played quite well.  Last hole I pulled my iron shot but -- on the side of the 18th, slammed when I hit -- I just tried to stop and I hit it and pulled it left in the bunker and had a bad lie and nearly holed the putt.
I'm happy with the way I played this week and I feel like my game is in good condition, and I feel like I'm going to have a good few weeks coming up.
Q. You come into the week with the expectation as one of the main British talents.  Did you feel that coming into the week or did you just --
CHARLEY HULL: Not really, no.  I just kind of went out there and played golf.
Q. And the weather, again, it's been up-and-down, nice in the morning, windy, wet in the afternoon.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it has.  Yeah.
Q. How have you dealt with that?
CHARLEY HULL: Just kind of got on with it, really.  That's all you've got to do in the weather, just get on with it.
Q. Is there any sort of stand out moments from the week that you take away to next week?  I know it's going to be a different tournament.
CHARLEY HULL: Not really, no.  I just feel like the whole week was a good week and I enjoyed it a lot.
Q. Solheim Cup in a couple of weeks' time, are you excited for that?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I'm buzzing.  I think it should be a good week.  I'm looking forward to it.  I think it should be fun back in America.  I prefer playing it when it's in America, actually.  The crowds are pretty big out there, so I enjoy it.
Q. You've been asked before about who you would like to play with and I think you said you don't really mind.  Has that changed?
CHARLEY HULL: No, I don't mind who they put me with.
