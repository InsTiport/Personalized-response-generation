Q. What is it about representing the golf, when you're playing for the flag, just incredible.
CHARLEY HULL: I enjoy it. It's a lot of fun. I just approach this week as any other week though, mentally as coming into the golf. I feel like I prepared quite well, played quite well coming into it and just having fun this week.

Q. Does it feel different, if you've got, say, a Team GB shirt on?
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know, the material feels different, but I don't know. Yeah but like at the end of the day, I'm kind of representing my country every week I feel like when I'm playing, but this week, you know you're a part of the team, so it's good fun. 

Q. Is this as well as you've played since maybe the ANA Inspiration?
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know, I feel like I've had some really good rounds. Like at the British Open, I feel like I played pretty well and I feel like I've been playing good. Just probably haven't been scoring as well as I wanted to. But felt like I've been playing decent.

Q. Ballâ€‘striking looks good, just petting the putter hot or hotter? 
CHARLEY HULL: Keep it in play.

Q. Jaime said you haven't missed a shot in two days. 
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I don't really look at what I do. I just kind of get off the golf course and go to the gym. I don't really analyze where I am. I just kind of think, oh, yeah, I played decent, another round tomorrow.

Q. Have you been in touch with Justin Rose? 
CHARLEY HULL: No, I haven't spoke to him. I don't really know Justin, but I heard he's a really nice guy and it's pretty cool what he done.

Q. Were you out here Sunday when he won the medal? 
CHARLEY HULL: No, I only flew in at nine o'clock, so I couldn't see it.
