Q. How do you assess today?
CHARLEY HULL: I didn't hit it that well today.  Kind of scrambled.  Bit of a shame at the last hole because of the berm on the fairway.  It bounced my ball into like the first cut, but it was settled down.  That's why I hit it in the water.
But not too bad.  I scrambled well.
Q. What's your preparation been in the run-up up to these two weeks?
CHARLEY HULL: I was poorly from Hazeltine on, so I had food poisoning that week, salmonella poisoning from the tournament and I was ill that week.  I pulled out of the next one, and then in hospital at home, so just starting to feel a bit better.
Q. What did they do with you in hospital?
CHARLEY HULL: Just testing it.  Salmonella poisoning can stay up to a month or more.  It can go and come back.
Q. Do you know what you ate?
CHARLEY HULL: No. Something at the golf course because a few people got it.
Q. Wow.  So when was the last time you were in hospital?
CHARLEY HULL: Went last week for a checkup because still wasn't feeling right.  I'm feeling a lot better this week.
Q. How did that impact your practicing?
CHARLEY HULL: I was practicing good.  Yeah, practicing well.  It's weird.  Just comes on and off.  Just feels a bit weird.  It was just annoying because them two weeks I felt like I wanted to play well in those two tournaments.  It was just a shame.
Q. You were sick?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, sick.
Q. How long after?
CHARLEY HULL: It would come for a few days and go and come back again.  When I came home I was still feeling bad.
Q. Were you able to eat?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, gave me some antibiotic things and my caddie had it bad as well.  I think another caddie had it as well.  Quite a few people had it.
Q. Before the KPMG?
CHARLEY HULL: No, that was at the tournament.
Q. You haven't discussed what you could have eaten in common?
CHARLEY HULL: No.  They said it could be like on the surface or something.  Feeling a lot better now.
Q. When did you start practicing seriously?
CHARLEY HULL: I took a week off and been practicing the last two weeks.
Q. And how long were you in hospital for?
CHARLEY HULL: I just went in and out I did.  Yeah, because I had like tests and blood test and stuff.
Q. Did they put you on a drip?
CHARLEY HULL: No, they didn't.  I don't like needles, but I had to have a lot of tests.
Q. Did they put you on a lot of water or tell you to drink water?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, drink a lot of water.  It was giving me acid as well.  It was a weird thing.  My caddie had exactly the same thing.
Q. Heat bothering you this week?
CHARLEY HULL: Not this week.  No, not this week.  It's fine.
Q. How much weight did you lose in the process?
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know if I lost any really.  I'm not sure.  Do I look skinnier?
Q. Yes.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.  (Laughter.)
Q. I think you understand the ten stone mark now.
CHARLEY HULL: No, no. I'm about ten and a half stone I am.
Q. Are you sure?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, 65 KGs.  Yeah.
Q. I'm afraid you're ten stone in whatever I read about you from the British...
CHARLEY HULL: Well, what's 65 KG?  That's probably just over ten stone or something, so, yeah.
Q. What did you learn from the last time playing at home at Woburn that you think will help you?
CHARLEY HULL: Just that there was a lot media attention.  It's kind of helped because obviously Georgia won last year.  Media attention will be on her, which will be nice.  I'm just going to chill that week.
Q. Were you practicing at Woburn when you were home?
CHARLEY HULL: Not really.  I played one round round there last week but I played off the backs.  That's like a 7,200 yards.
Q. Wow.
CHARLEY HULL: It's a better golf course off the back tees.
Q. How does that prepare you?
CHARLEY HULL: I couldn't play off their tees because it was all closed.  That's the reason why I just played off the backs.
Q. What you shoot?
CHARLEY HULL: 3-under.
Q. Good Lord.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.  I play better off the backs than I do off the tees at the tournament.  Feel like the holes are way better off the back tees.  It's a shame we don't play it similar holes.
Q. Definitely sure you're not?
CHARLEY HULL: No, because I wasn't allowed to play off those certain tees that were closed.
Q. Is Joe going to caddie for you next week?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.
Q. Who is your team now?
CHARLEY HULL: Matt Belsham is my full swing coach and my short game, and Nick Soto does my putting.
Q. Where are they based?
CHARLEY HULL: North Hampton Golf Club, and Matt just comes to me wherever I am.
Q. Where do you practice most?
CHARLEY HULL: Woburn or Kettering.  Practice at Kettering a lot.
Q. Okay.  Great.  Be looking at home next week, staying at home?
CHARLEY HULL: No, because the traffic is so bad on the N1.  It takes me an hour and a half, two hours to get there sometimes.  I'm staying nearby.  It takes 40 minutes usually, but because if the traffic on the N1 it's a bit -- there was a six-hour hold up on it the other day.  It was crazy.
Q. So feeling 100% now?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, feel good.  Feel good.
Q. How do you rate yourself now in the tournament?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, still 4-under, so low at the weekend because the rain is coming in.  I hope it gets really windy and rainy because I prefer this golf course like that.
Q. Why?
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know.  I just don't know why they turned the last into a par-5; I thought it was good par-4 I though.  Just plays harder, and I feel like I'm more of a scramble -- like not a scramble, but you got to o stay in and dig deep when it's hard conditions.
Usually takes a lot of the field out it because people quit.
Q. How would you assess your year so far?
CHARLEY HULL: Been a bit up and down.  I've been poorly twice actually, and it kind took a chunk out of the season.  Like after the U.S. Open I was getting some momentum and playing well, and then just from Hazeltine it was annoying because I really wanted to play them three weeks in row and obviously didn't play it.
Hopefully now I can just play everything and be good.
Q. You said poorly.  Is that what you said, you're feeling poorly?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I was poorly.
Q. When was before that?
CHARLEY HULL: Oh, in Australia I got a sickness bug again and the flu.  It was only that one week that I was poor.  Apart from that, I've played well from like ANA and then -- I played well at ANA, San Francisco, Kingsmill, and U.S. Open I had a bad last hole.
I felt like I was coming into some momentum then.  Hopefully I can come into some momentum now.
