Q. Welcome.  First major of the season.  Just tell me a little bit of where your game is at.
CHARLEY HULL: I feel pretty good.  Like I've changed my clubs and stuff.  Looking forward to using them this week.
Q. Took one of my questions out of my mouth.  You changed clubs two weeks ago.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, TaylorMade.
Q. And you were Titleist for how long?
CHARLEY HULL: About 2011.
Q. What was the main reason behind changing?  Tell me about your new clubs, setups, or anything.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, just like them and I think their service is really good.  And the woods are really, really good.
Q. One of the main things I saw in your bag was your putter.  Tell me about the story behind the putter.
CHARLEY HULL: Well, it was my caddie's putter and it was TaylorMade and I really liked it, so I've just going to use it from now on.  It helps me line up a little bit better.
Q. It's the same length?  Haven't altered it in any way?
CHARLEY HULL: No, same length.
Q. Grip the different?
CHARLEY HULL: No different grip, but similar to my old one.
Q. So you've had three top 10s in the last five years here.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.
Q. Probably your best performing major of the five.  What is it you love about this tournament?
CHARLEY HULL: I like it because it's a ball strikers golf course.  You got to hit it good.  I just really like it.  It's my first ever pro tournament    well, I was an amateur and I it was my first ever professional tournament I ever played in when I was like 15 or 16, and I just loved it ever since.
Q. Is there anything about the finish that gives you goosebumps?  Everyone talks about the jump.  I think it's more of an American thing growing up seeing the jump.  Are you aware of it?  Do you think about it?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, you see the water and stuff, but I think I just like the golf course.  I just think it's so much fun.  It's a proper golf course.
Q. Your team is here this week?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, my fiance and my caddie.
Q. So no Dad?
CHARLEY HULL: No.  He hasn't been out for a while because he's too busy working on my house at home.  I'm having my courtyard built because I had it all done.
Q. Great.  Couple more things.  Tell me a little bit about your win and your run of events on the LPGA?
CHARLEY HULL: I played in every event apart from one.   The only one I haven't played was last week.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your week off.  Any reason behind taking a week off?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, because my boyfriend had a fight, he had a title fight, and I went to watch him.  It's in not about me and my golf.  He sacrifices loads of things for me and my golf.
At the end of the day, it was important for him to have a life as well.  I went to go and watch him do that.  I took the week off and practiced really hard last week.  I feel my game is getting into some good form.  Just need to get my putter hot because I am hitting a lot of greens.
Yeah, I had that week off to watch him fight and he won, so I'm proud of him.
Q. Great news.  He's a boxer presumably.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.
Q. You look like you've done some work in the off season.  Are you training with him in any way?
CHARLEY HULL: Sometimes we train, but I haven't actually been to the gym for like two weeks.  I don't know how I lost this weight.  I don't know.  I had cake every day last week.  I think my metabolism has just speeded up.
