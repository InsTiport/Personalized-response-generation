Q. How does it feel to make a point for your team today?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it felt great.  I felt I played good all day.  It was a gray end to the day.  I rolled a couple in, so it was great.
Q. It's your second point today, Charley, you must be happy with the way you played today?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I feel like I played great.  I'm just buzzing for tomorrow.
Q. Gwladys, how does it feel to be back at the Solheim Cup and win a point today?
GWLADYS NOCERA: It feels great.  Charley is playing unbelievable.  It was up to me to play safe.  And if I could make a few putts then that will help her.  It was teamwork.
Q. What impressed you the most about Charley's game this afternoon?
GWLADYS NOCERA: Well, she's very impressive.  She's junior and I'm senior and it's all right.
CHARLEY HULL: It's great.  And helped me with a few putts there and I holed it.
It was a great day out there today.  I really enjoyed this morning and I really enjoyed in afternoon.  To get two points on the board is fantastic.  Gwladys played so steady out there and let me attack the pins and I thought it was perfect teamwork.
Q. Your putting is good this week, isn't it?
CHARLEY HULL: I love putting in match play.  I love putting under pressure.  So, yeah, I'm buzzing.
Q. Gwladys, it's a team game out there, but you played your part as well, you played well.
GWLADYS NOCERA: I know Charley's game is very offensive.  My game is less offensive.  So I'd just make sure she was -- I felt I did my part.  I love playing with Charley, and match play is just the best.
Q. Nice start for the afternoon and the first day?
GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, we couldn't ask for better.
