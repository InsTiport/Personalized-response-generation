Q. Bit of a hiccup but a strong finish, how do you feel about the day's round?
CHARLEY HULL: I played solid really.  I just had one probably bad hole which was the 16th.  I hit it a little bit right, but it wasn't actually a bad drive, I just didn't get much draw on it.  Apart from that, I thought it was a pretty solid day.
Q. Some have felt the fairways were narrow.  How did you feel?
CHARLEY HULL: I didn't really notice that actually.  I was hitting it pretty straight.  I hope I do that again tomorrow.  But I think it was pretty much (indiscernible).
Q. Things are firming up.  How did you feel over the course, do you expect it to change tomorrow?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I actually feel like it's quite softer than it has been in previous years.  This is my fourth year playing in the tournament even though I'm 20.  I feel like I've played this quite a few times now.  In previous years I felt like it's been bouncier, but maybe as the week progresses, It's going to get a bit firmer.
Q. Having played here four times, how comfortable are you?
CHARLEY HULL: I love this golf course.  I love everything about this tournament.  I love the surroundings and I just think it's a great tournament.  I'm very comfortable here.
Q. Last but not least, yesterday's big news.  Annika's going to be captain for Solheim.  What do you think?
CHARLEY HULL: I think that's great.  I think she's going to be a great captain, and I think it will be a lot of fun.
