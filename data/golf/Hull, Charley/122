 Q.   Only one other person has ever beaten Paula in singles.   You didn't beat her, you crushed her.   Tell us how that feels.   
CHARLEY HULL:   It feels good.   We both played great today.   We both missed a few short putts, but, no, it was really good.   I really enjoyed it.  
   
 Q.   Describe your emotion as that match is unfolding and hitting all these incredible shots?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I always take it one shot at a time.   I wasn't really thinking what she was doing too much, and I just played my own game.  
And that last hole is great, where she hit it in the bunker, and then I hit it to like three feet, and then she holed the bunker shot.   That was just a real good memory that I'll always have.  
   
 Q.   When your friends back home ask you, how was the Solheim Cup, how will you describe it?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Wicked.  
   
 Q.   You just asked Paula to sign a ball for you.   You're still a fan, aren't you?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, I'm still a fan.   And I'm going to give it to my friend, James, because he's a big fan.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel nervous at any point throughout that match?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I didn't really feel too nervous.   Probably on the putt on the hole before, because she holed a really good bunker shot.  
   
 Q.   And before today how were you feeling?   Because I heard you weren't feeling too well.   
CHARLEY HULL:   No, I felt sick, like at dinner.   I got a bit hot on the range.   I really didn't drink enough water, I guess.  
   
 Q.   But you got over that pretty quickly and stayed focus.   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How did it feel when you started moving ahead and ahead and ahead?   Did you feel at any point, that you thought that you had this in the bag?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, well, I mean I made about five birdies, so it was good.   
   
 Q.   14, you hit a great tee shot.   Just tell me what club you hit.   
CHARLEY HULL:   I hit a 3â€‘wood, and I pitched it like eight feet left of the flag, and it just rolled up and didn't roll all the way down.  
   
 Q.   So you were looking good for eagle?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, but it was just such a hard putt.   Putts in the practice rounds were easier, but it was hard.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, Paula Creamer is another top American player.   Does this feel extra special to beat her?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, it feels really good.  
   
 Q.   And what are you going to do now?   Go out and cheer on your teammates this afternoon?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about the overall score line?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I haven't really looked at it too much.   But we just got to keep pushing.   
   
 Q.   And this morning, Liselotte Neumann gave you some advice and some support when you went out.   What was the feeling, what was the message?  
CHARLEY HULL:   It felt really good.   It was nice to have Annika watching as well.
