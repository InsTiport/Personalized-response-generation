 Q.  6-under, got a pretty strong start out there.  What was working?  
CHARLEY HULL: I thought I've just been hitting it really well, touch wood, and putting good and hit it close.  I just felt like I was pretty solid out there.  On the back nine, I gave myself nearly a birdie chance on every hole, and I just didn't kind of make them.  But I felt like it was a good score out there today.   
 Q.  Did you feel like this was coming on after Malaysia?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, like I felt like I played really well in Malaysia apart from the first round and apart from the last three rounds in Malaysia, I played really solid.  So I felt like I had been in good form the past couple weeks.   
 Q.  You really got it going a couple days at the Solheim Cup, as well.  I know it didn't end how you wanted team-wise but you really played well.  Did that give you confidence?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played great and I played good in Evian the week before apart from the last round, and I played good in Canada.  And the last round of the British Open, I felt like it started from then.   
After Solheim I played in France and I had a great last finishing up for that three-week stretch, I came like fourth.  So I felt like I was in good shape coming into here.   
 Q.  Pretty much had a great week here last year, too, and I know you hit the ball a long ways.  What works on this track?  Is it a bomber's track?  It seems like the stories are kind of different on what players think work out here.  
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know really.  I look at each golf course if you hit the fairways and you hit the greens, you give yourself putts, and if you can hole them, you go low.  I tend to not took too much into a golf course.   
 Q.  It seems like typically the winning score is somewhere between 10- to 15-under.  Scores are a lot lower today; why do you think that is?  Is it pretty scorable out there?  
CHARLEY HULL: I feel like everything is in good condition on this golf course.  The sun's out and it's not too windy out there, so I feel like you can go low and post a low score.  It's good fun out there.   
 Q.  I know you've been in contention a lot this year.  What do you think is the next step to get you to the point of winning out here?  
CHARLEY HULL: Just patience at the moment.  Just scope on pushing on, keep on hitting good scores.  I'm only 19; I just feel like I've got a lot more to progress in my game and a lot more to learn.  I feel really comfortable with my caddie, Adam.  He's great.   
 Q.  When did you start working with Adam?  He says you have all the shots.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, well, I first started working with him the first week I was in Canada, and I think I finished eighth there, seventh, I can't remember which one, but we've had two Top-10s in the last five weeks, so I've been pretty happy.
