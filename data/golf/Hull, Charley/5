  Q. Charley, what a great round today, and a lot up and downs.  What worked out there today?
 CHARLEY HULL:   Felt like I hit my irons pretty good, hit it pretty solid.  Few tee shots let me down, but I managed to keep it going.
 Yeah, I just felt like played pretty solid.  My game is warming up nicely for the rest of the season.  I've worked pretty hard in the off-season, so hopefully see some more good results.
 Q. You definitely had a strong game at CME.  What do you plan to do the next two weeks?
 CHARLEY HULL:   I fly back to England so I will just be practicing at home.  The golf course aren't open but we are allowed to practice still on the golf courses, professionals are, but the flags, they don't have flags on the greens.
 So I don't know, I'll just being working on my game with my coach and maintaining.
 Q. If you're flying home, when are you going to come back?
 CHARLEY HULL:   I fly out on Monday of Kia.
