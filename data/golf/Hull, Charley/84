SUZANN PETTERSEN: Charley, gosh, you've just got to tell her to hit it right at the pin.  She's awesome, it's fantastic to play with her.
Q. Charley, you were pretty cool all the way around, no real celebrations, and you hole that putt on 17 and bit of a fist pump and the hardest high five I think I've ever seen.  What was going on there?
CHARLEY HULL: I was just buzzing.  I felt like I just needed to get a kick start.  We made some birdies and it just got to me on the 17th hole.  Nearly having that hole-in-one on the 15th was just fantastic and then holing a putt, and Suzann holed a great putt on the last, I was just buzzing.
Q. Fantastic way to finish.  Those few shots you hit coming in made the difference.
SUZANN PETTERSEN: You can't be really aggressive.  I told Charley, let's throw darts at the pins, stay aggressive.  This was a robbery.  This one was a robbery.
Q. Is this one of the best wins you've ever had?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, this goes down in the books.
