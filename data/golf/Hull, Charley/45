 Q.  You mentioned you're struggling with a cold, but a round of 67, just what the doctor ordered.  Shot up the leaderboard into third position?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played really good today.  I left so many shots out there, so I feel really, really annoyed with myself.  But I just couldn't get my putter going at all.   
 Q.  You got off to a great start.  Nothing like an early eagle?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I know.  I hit a really good drive on the second hole.  Got on the green and holed a putt from the back edge of the green, so it was good.   
 Q.  Why do you think those putts weren't quite dropping, one of those days?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, one of them days.  But I feel like I'm doing something slightly wrong with my stroke.  I'm just pressing down and I'm pulling them a little bit left, so I need to work on that.
