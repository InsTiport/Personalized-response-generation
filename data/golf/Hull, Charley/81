 Q.  You had a great start, and then it was quite quiet.  Great start, eagle, bogey, birdie.  Talk a little bit about that.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played solid from the word go, and I left myself quite a lot of birdie chances.  Like I think I had a birdie chance, a good birdie chance on every hole from 17th hole all the way to the 9th hole here.  So it was crazy.   
I was getting a bit frustrated on my back nine which is the front nine of the golf course because I had so many birdie chances that I could have had and I didn't take them.  But I'm happy to finish with birdie and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  So you're in a really good position for tomorrow.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.   
 Q.  What is your best finish?  
CHARLEY HULL: 7th.  I'm looking forward to it.  It should be fun.   
 Q.  So, yeah, we watched you a little bit on the way going in and you were so close.  How did you keep your frustration level?  
CHARLEY HULL: I think the greens are a bit slowish.  I'm used to them being a bit faster.  But I feel like the golf course is in good condition.  It's hard to get to greens quick.  But, yeah, like I'm just going to keep my head down and go for it.   
 Q.  And you felt like you were driving it off the tee really well?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I feel like I'm feeling good.  So I'm going to hit some balls now, do some putting and go and grab some food.
