Q. What were you thinking on the 14th?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I hit a good 3-wood there, pitched it right in the middle of the green, pretty sure I hit that fan, and it rolled up, and then I made the putt because a tricky one there to go back to all square, and then it left it that far short on the hole after for birdie.  But on the next hole, just mis-hit my shot on 17 and then didn't (indiscernible) on 18, and I only had like eight feet or whatever it was up the hill, but I didn't want to go for it because if it lipped out you could obviously do something stupid.  Obviously if it was a straight putt I would have hit a better putt instead of lagging it to the hole.
Q. How would you describe your week?
CHARLEY HULL: Coughing.  You know, I feel like I've hit it quite well.  Actually I feel I've had a good few weeks.
Q. Have you enjoyed playing for England here?
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it's fun.  It's a lot of fun.  It's enjoyable because you don't really get to do that when you play golf, so it was good.
Q. And then the morning with Georgia against the Koreans, talk about that.
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, they're playing pretty good.  Yeah, they played decent.  I think the day before they made a ridiculous amount of birdies in that rain.  But yeah, it was a good match.
