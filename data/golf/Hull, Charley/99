  CHARLEY HULL: I'm happy the way I hit it.  I hit it great.   Q.  Finished a major tournament in red numbers.  What do you think?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I'm happy with that, definitely.  In two tournaments I think I've got my full card now to play for the rest of the season, and that was one of the things I wanted to do.  I've had a few good tournaments.   Q.  You've be bouncing back and fourth in LET and majors and everything like that, so now you have the experience not having had any like that.  How do you build and adjust?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely I'll be playing the majority over here now, because I've had a good start to the season so far and hopefully I can build on that and have a few more good rounds out here in America.   Q.  You've seen this course twice?  CHARLEY HULL: Three times.   Q.  All right.  Do you think you have a feel for it?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.  I think this golf course definitely suits me.  It will be great playing a winning round here one day.   Q.  Did you say you hit 17 of 18 in regulation?  And I heard on the fairway you hit a monster drive?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I hit 332 yards.   Q.  Is that probably your longest in play?  CHARLEY HULL: I hit a 320 yard drive last month.  But, yeah, that's probably my longest.   Q.  So you started off like a train, playing pretty well.  You were playing great.  Just the putts weren't quite dropping today.  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I just wasn't holing any putts.  I was hitting it so close, but I feel like my game's in great shape.   Q.  This year you're in all the majors, so it's probably a little less tense?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.  I think it's a great position to be in, and I'm hitting it fantastic.  Hopefully, I'll be up there more.   Q.  Every time you play a major now, are you feeling more at home and more comfortable and on the leaderboards?  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, definitely.  I'm really happy.  I love playing majors.  I feel like they suit my game the most.   Q.  Is there anything in particular you want to do different in the next one?  CHARLEY HULL: Just work on my putter more.  So if I play the same I should have been nine to ten inches today.  It was crazy I played that well.   Q.  What are your plans now?  CHARLEY HULL: Go home.  Going to come into the studio tomorrow and then going to fly home.   Q.  What is the next time you play?  CHARLEY HULL: Maybe Texas or if not Kingsmill.   Q.  Where you're ranked now --  CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, well, I get all the tournaments now.  So I get my full card, I think, so, yeah, it's good.
