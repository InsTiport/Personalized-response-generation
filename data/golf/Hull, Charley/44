 Q.  Another very good round today.  Built on yesterday?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I played pretty good today.  I missed a couple of short putts, but then I holed a few decent ones and I felt pretty good.  Looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Quite a lot of birdies today.  Playing easier out there or were you just playing better?  
CHARLEY HULL: I played well yesterday and I played good today.  I just feel like my game's in really good shape at the minute.   
 Q.  And you started scoring better, holing putts.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I just missed a couple of short ones.  They are quite tricky sometimes because the holes are on a little knuckle and it's like they will go this way or that way, do you know what I mean.   
 Q.  In terms of going forward over the weekend, what's your view of this course?  Is it one that suits your eye?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it suits my eye.  I think it's a low-scoring golf course.  Once you get it going, you can go pretty low.  So I think it's good.   
 Q.  Anything in particular that you like about it?  
CHARLEY HULL: I like everything.  I like it, the shapes on the greens and stuff.  I find putting, like off the green, onto the greens quite hard, so I've been chipping quite a lot this week.  I quite enjoy that.
