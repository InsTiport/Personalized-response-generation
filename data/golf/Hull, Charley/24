 Q.  Charley, nice round there; 69, 3-under par.  Puts you in quite a nice position for the weekend.  Tell me a little bit about the day?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, played pretty steady.  Started off with a bogey and bounced back on the second hole, and birdied 2 and 3.  Yeah, played pretty steady.  I enjoyed today.  It was good.   
 Q.  How different were the conditions this morning from yesterday?  You played in the afternoon.  
CHARLEY HULL: Oh, it was crazy.  It was ridiculous, I think was 6th hole yesterday I hit 3-wood, rescue into it, and today I hit driver -- no, no, no, 3-wood, pitching wedge.  That's how different the wind was.   
 Q.  You spoke before this event about this being one f your favorites majors in terms of from a scoring point of view.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.   
 Q.  Have you got the top of the leaderboard in your sights?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.  I love this golf course.  I think it's a proper golf course.  It's not a birdiefest, and I prefer that.   
 Q.  Scoring doesn't seem to be as low as in previous years.  What do you put that down to?  
CHARLEY HULL: Several of the tee boxes have moved back.  And I think the wind is a lot windier.   
 Q.  Do you have a number in mind that you think might win this?  I know you're only halfway through and might not think about.  
CHARLEY HULL: I don't think about stuff like that.  I just kind of take each day as it comes.
