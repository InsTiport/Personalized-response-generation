 Q.  Good start today.  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was good.  I started off pretty well on the back nine, which was my front nine.  But apart from that, yeah, I felt like I played pretty decent.  I couldn't hole a putt on the front nine, and I wasn't swinging that well.  But I figured it out at the end of my round and hit it pretty good.   
 Q.  Was that because the greens were fast?  
CHARLEY HULL: I actually left quite a few putts short.  So I struggled with that for some reason.  I don't know, it was weird.   
 Q.  You've obviously played well on this course in the past.  Do you just feel really, really comfortable?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I love this golf course.  It's probably one of my favorite golf courses in the world and one of my favorite tournaments, this and the British Open.   
 Q.  What specifically?  
CHARLEY HULL: I don't know.  It just brings back good memories because I played it here when I was 15 or 16, so, yeah.   
 Q.  How did you find going out the last group of the day?  
CHARLEY HULL: It was quite weird because every year I played here on the first round, every single year I've had a morning tee time.  So to have an afternoon tee time was quite strange, and especially that late, do you know what I mean?   
 Q.  At the end you nearly eagled that last hole and sort of got your momentum going on the back nine, which you did a lot actually last year, I remember?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, exactly.  I just kind of get into the game and enjoy it all.   
 Q.  Get the pace of it?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you feed off your playing partner a bit?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, she played great.  She played great.  She had a pretty good start as well.  So, yeah, it was just good playing out there with her.
