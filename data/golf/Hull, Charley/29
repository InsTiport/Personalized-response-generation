 Q.  That was some game today.  You finished at 5-under, great run of birdies around the turn.  Nice eagle on 15.  Tell us what happened on that hole?  
CHARLEY HULL: I just hit a good drive.  It was a drivable par 4, to about six feet and holed it for eagle.   
 Q.  Story of the day.  These are tough conditions.  It's cold out there and you're wearing shorts?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah.   
 Q.  I think the only one in the field.  Did you not feel it?  
CHARLEY HULL: No, not really.  I'm used to wearing shorts.  I have four layers on top but I like wearing shorts.  I don't really like playing in trousers.   
 Q.  What was the key to your round?  You were hitting it close?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I hit it close.  Holed some good putts, and then I think I had a couple of 3-putts, but I'm pretty happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  Nice to be back in action after the team challenge of last week?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  But I like to be back playing stroke play.  That's my favorite kind of way to play golf, stroke play, but last week was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  When I last spoke to you, you had a bit of laryngitis.  You're sounding a lot better now?  
CHARLEY HULL: Yeah, I feel much better.
