  THE MODERATOR:   All right.   So you've been out playing pretty regularly out on the LPGA Tour‑‑  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   ‑‑ this season.   How comfortable do you feel?   What's the overall feeling just being out here and splitting time between the LPGA and LET?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   I've played in quite a few events.   I played in the Kraft, and I played well there, which is the first major of the year, and came in seventh.   I played really good in some LPGA events this year.   I've had some good Top 10 finishes and did well in the majors that I've been in.   
I had like four weeks off, and like I played last week.   Before that I had four weeks off, and after British Open‑‑ well, I played British Open, and then I played in Germany, but I had four weeks off after that, so it's good to get back into it, because I didn't like having weeks off.   It was a bit frustrating.   But to make the cut last week and to play half decent, you know, I didn't shoot over par, so slowly getting into it for the Evian.  
THE MODERATOR:   What did you do in the four weeks off?   What was the time passer?   
CHARLEY HULL:   I played with‑‑ I kept trying to keep competitive rounds, you know, with my friends.   And I played with some of them who play on the European Tour or the men's tour.   So it was good to have that competition.  
   
 Q.   How many more sponsor exemptions are you allowed?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I'm only allowed one more.  
   
 Q.   One more?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   After this one?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   But I'll be playing in Malaysia because I couldn't get one for the next LPGA event in America, because it was only given away I think locally.   It's a bit annoying.   Malaysia doesn't count toward the money list for me to get my card because it's a no‑cut event.  
THE MODERATOR:   How much have you been paying attention to kind of where you've been ranking on the Money List?   I know that was one of your goals is try to play as many events here and get the experience, but also to potentially get status.   How much have you been concentrating on that?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   It's been important to me.   And you know, I've been playing very well.   I've had like a third place finish, a seventh place finish.   Top 20s and like a twelfth in a major, seventh in a major.   I've been getting a lot of experience, and I've had my first win on the Ladies European Tour as well.   
So I'm pretty happy.   My world ranking got down to 26 as well a few weeks ago.   I think I'm back up to 28, but it's still good and I'm pretty happy with the way I'm going.  
   
 Q.   Is your plan to try to play out here full time this year?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   Yeah.   Definitely, 100 percent.  
   
 Q.   And do you know how much money‑‑ do you have like a projection of how much money you've got to earn the rest of the year to do that?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I've got to be inside the top 40, but it's usually you've got to be inside the top 80 is it.  
THE MODERATOR:   Top 80 to regain.  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   To regain your card.   I would have that easy if I was a member of the tour, but I'm not, so I have to be in the top 40.   But yeah, no, I definitely want to be out here next year.   If not, I'll have to go back to Q‑School.  
   
 Q.   Do you know, are you allowed into the final stages after you do second stage?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Final stage, because of my world ranking.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played out in this area of the country before?  
CHARLEY HULL:   No.   I played down in like Palm Springs, where the Kraft was at the beginning of the year.   I've been there a few times, but I haven't been this far north.  
   
 Q.   Have you had a look at the course?  
CHARLEY HULL:   I only played nine holes yesterday because my luggage went missing, and I only got it yesterday evening, so I was only playing nine holes.   And I'm in the pro am today.   I usually like to see two 18 holes of a golf course, but I suppose nine holes in 18 holes is better than nothing.  
THE MODERATOR:   Did you play nine last night when you got your clubs?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, last night.   Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   What were your initial thoughts of the course?   Did it remind you of anywhere you've played before?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   I like the golf course.   I think it's really nice.   I think it's definitely a low‑scoring golf course.   The rough isn't too thick, but there's a lot of tall trees, which I really like.  
I think it's a pretty golf course as well, so I'm looking forward to this week and see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR:   I know you've been switching back and forth, LET, LPGA.   How much is that experience on just the travel and the grind of losing your clubs and being in stressful situations to hopefully prepare you for next year?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   Well, you know, it's been an experience, but it's been really good as well, because you get to see all the ups and downs of traveling.   But you know, I've got my clubs now, and I can now compete in the event.  
THE MODERATOR:   Is that the biggest grind, just the travel of everything?   Is that something you've gotten used to pretty quick?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   I pretty much sleep on the plane.  
THE MODERATOR:   Easy sleeper.   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   Pretty good.   It's just probably carrying your luggage around in the airport which is a bit annoying.   
THE MODERATOR:   Dad doesn't help you with that?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, dad does, but I mean even carrying one bag is annoying.   That's why I have a small handbag now.   
   
 Q.   How do you handle the like caddie situation because you're playing in so many different events?  
CHARLEY HULL:   My caddie?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
CHARLEY HULL:   Oh, yeah.   I have my caddie with me all the time.   He just goes out and walks the golf course, tells me where to hit it.   And I try and hit it where he tells me to.   It makes it easier.  
   
 Q.   Is it the same guy who caddies for you on the LET?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   So you're dragging him all over the place?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   What's his name?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Gary.  
THE MODERATOR:   What's his last name?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Wildman.   
   
 Q.   He's the boss out there, just tells you what to do?  
CHARLEY HULL:   No, I'm the boss out there.   (Laughs).   
THE MODERATOR:   How long have you guys been together?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Since the Kraft, so that was my‑‑  
THE MODERATOR:   This year?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   How did you guys match up?   
CHARLEY HULL:   He just wanted to be caddie for me, so I was like, okay, because I didn't really want to have a caddie, because I won in Morocco without a caddie.   So I was just like, just don't say anything and then you can caddie for me.   There you go.  
THE MODERATOR:   Shut your mouth and get on the bag.   (Laughs).   Did you use a push cart in Morocco or did you carry?   
CHARLEY HULL:   No.   I had a man who carried my bag and stuff.  
THE MODERATOR:   A local guy?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   But he didn't even like‑‑  
THE MODERATOR:   Say a word.  
CHARLEY HULL:   No.   He just told me wind's to the right, to the left.   I had him in the previous year where I played my first pro event, and that was in Morocco, and I came in second in that event.   Then I won it this year, the following year after, so it was good.  
THE MODERATOR:   With the same local guy, who didn't say a word?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   His name is Eunice.   I like Morocco, though.   I like kind of like the‑‑ I don't know, like the Moroccan countries, the Turkey.   
THE MODERATOR:   Exotic.  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   I really like them.   Are they more like‑‑ the Arabic kind of countries.   I really like them kind of countries.  
THE MODERATOR:   Middle Eastern.   Has anybody helped you out here player wise?   I know you're friendly with the Solheim Cup players and stuff.   Has anybody played a role in giving you advice or the ins and outs of stuff?   
CHARLEY HULL:   No, not really.   I have like‑‑ I'm quite good friends with Jaye Green because we both grew up together in amateur golf, and you know, just‑‑ not really.   I just kind of keep to myself out there.   
THE MODERATOR:   What are you looking forward to the most at Evian in a couple of weeks?   I know you played there last year and didn't make the cut, but it's an event everybody looks forward to, playing in another major.  
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah.   I'm really looking forward to it.   It should be exciting, just keep on getting experience and stuff.   I just think it's going to be a great week.   Hopefully the weather is better than last year.  
You know, just try and do better than last year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Did you have any goals this year or is it just flat‑out make enough money, in top 40 or was it get a win when you're playing on the LPGA?   
CHARLEY HULL:   Yeah, just try and win.   Everywhere.   That's the way I try and look at it.  
THE MODERATOR:   So every event you're coming out and you're going in to win it?  
CHARLEY HULL:   Uh‑huh.
