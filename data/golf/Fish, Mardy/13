 Q.  Can you talk about today a little bit.  
MARDY FISH: Yeah, the conditions were certainly different and challenging, but fun in a way because the first two days were almost perfect conditions.  So it's nice to kind of play and show a little bit of your game.  I didn't show that today per se, but it's nice to kind of watch some of the really good players, the girls out here, and see what they do in these challenging conditions as well.  And a lot of people struggled.   
It's just nice to kind of see sometimes really, really, really awesome players have trouble in those conditions as well.   
 Q.  Exactly.  How was it playing with Brooke?  
MARDY FISH: We played the last three days.  What a sweetheart.  I'm just trying to stay out of her way.  She's trying to win a golf tournament.  Came up a little short for her today.  I'm certainly a fan, and I'll continue to watch her career over the years for sure.   
 Q.  And was there one or two holes where the wind was the strongest?  
MARDY FISH: Yeah, down on 4, down the second shot on 10, the tee shot on 9, 3, and then into on 14.  Even 7 was a really hard hole.  We made bogey at 7 and was like -- it was like an eagle, it felt like.  Yeah, there was a lot of challenging holes, but it was for everyone.
