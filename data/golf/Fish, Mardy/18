 Q.  As far as this tournament going four days now versus the three, how is that going to impact you?  How do you think it's going to impact the rest of the field?  
MARDY FISH: I think it's going to only help the better players.  The more opportunity to sort of -- sort of push yourself away from the field.  They've changed the scoring system a little bit now to where it's 2 points for a par.  So I think that will bunch a lot of people together, give them a bunch more points.   
 Q.  Call it the Mulder-Fish rule?  
MARDY FISH: I don't know.  But in the end, I'm not sure that -- you know, you've still got to make birdies.  You've still got to not make too many mistakes, and I think the better players will show throughout four days, obviously, instead of three.
