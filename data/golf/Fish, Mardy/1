  THE MODERATOR:   Mardy, congratulations.  What a great win, third win in this event.  Tell us how you feel.
 MARDY FISH:   Feels awesome.  Yeah, it's been a long week.  Four rounds out there, four days in a row for me a lots of golf.  So I'm ready to put my feet up a little bit.
 Yeah, it's great.  Always great to be invited back.  They put on such a great event, Diamond Resorts and Mike Flaskey and Aaron Stewart and the team.
 It's just a lot of fun.  I don't get to compete much anymore, so this is always nice to get out there and play with those guys.  A lot of good players.
 Q. So you mentioned maybe being injured a little bit before coming into this week and not playing a ton.  How did you feel this week with your body?
 MARDY FISH:   Yeah, sometimes I feel like maybe I play better when I don't play as much.  I don't have as much in my head to think about.
 And, yeah, I hit the ball great all week.  Made some good putts and shot some pretty low rounds for the most part.  Couple 5-unders.
 So, yeah, I mean, super happy with the way I played.  I don't know what I won by, but it was tough to sort of follow along.  It was nice.  Yeah, just sort of kept going along today and playing our balls instead of theirs and worrying about where they are and stuff.
 Just trying to get it in as quick as possible and see where we were on the back nine.
 Q. Any significance in the fact that you were able to win at the same time win the Kordas won the other division?
 MARDY FISH:   Yeah, it's awesome.  A lot in common with her dad and her mom.  Her mom was a great player as well.  So what a sporting family they have.  It was nice.  I got to play with Nelly and Jessica and Danielle this week, so it was a nice test for me to try not to embarrass myself.
