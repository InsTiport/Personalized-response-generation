Q. Great playing. 
MARDY FISH: Thank you.

Q. Leading into the final round. 
MARDY FISH: Thank you, yeah, it's a fun golf course to play. Like I said yesterday, I grew up in these kinds of conditions, although it was cold today. It was still windy. They weren't easy. Sometimes you can focus in a little bit better. I think I had a 25 today. That's a good number for us. Not many mistakes. So it was a nice day.

Q. That's good. Was the cold a factor? Were your hands cold or anything? 
MARDY FISH: It wasn't really. It was just kind of the ball didn't travel quite as much as it would have. I got a little unlucky on 17. I thought I hit a pretty good drive, and I got into one of the only divots that was over there in the rough and on this wet surface. So I had to sort of lay out to the side. 
I played pretty smart and took my chances. Hit a good drive on 16, drive to the green there. All in all, a fun day.
