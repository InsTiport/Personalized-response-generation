Q. You were 3 under through the first seven holes. What was working for you?
MARDY FISH: I got a little lucky there on No. 7, hit it to like two feet for eagle. That's one of the reasons why it was that low. Yesterday I didn't play the front nine very well, and today I didn't play the back nine very well. So if I could merge them together, the front nine from today and the back nine from yesterday, it should go pretty well.
Q. What do you think happened to you after No. 7?
MARDY FISH: It's tough conditions. The wind is really blowing, and I hit a bad drive on 8 and was just kind of grinding it around. Made a good par on 10. That was a really tough hole today. I had a good par on 10. So I made a bogey on 8 and 9. Made bogey on like 12, 13, 14, and then got it and played it 1 under from there.
Q. I talked to John Smoltz earlier, and he said you were one of the names he was worried about going into the weekend. How does it make you feel knowing that you're a target?
MARDY FISH: I mean, I grew up in Florida, so playing Florida golf and knowing these conditions helps. I've won this tournament a few times. So that's probably why he said that.
