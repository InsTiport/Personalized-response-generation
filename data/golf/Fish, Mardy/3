  Q. Looks like you had another great round today.  I think you're in solo lead.  Tell us about today.
 MARDY FISH:   Yeah, it was a really solid round.  I hit the ball better than I scored.  I made my first bogey of the week on the par-5, 13, and then made two more bogeys on top of it.
 So it was tough to sort of stop the bogey train a little bit.  Then we had that long wait.  We had to wait for a while on 16.  It was nice to reset, and was able to make birdie on that hole.
 Yeah, any time you can -- look, we're not pros, so any time you can shoot under par is probably a good thing.  Not too many people are going to run away from you if you're shooting under par.
 It's a long tournament.  We're halfway through.  Happy with where I'm at.
 Q. Today you played with Jessica Korda; yesterday Nelly.
 MARDY FISH:   Yep.
 Q. Compare the two girl's games.
 MARDY FISH:   Yeah, tomorrow I'm going to play tennis with Sebastian.
 No, I mean, they're both so good.  It's fun to -- they have similar personalities.  They have really good attitudes on the course.  It's interesting so sort of watch that.
 They compete really, really well.  It was nice to have Peter out, too.  They're both so good that you're just trying to keep up and stay out of the way.
 Q. When you're playing with either one of them, do you find yourself talking more golf or talking tennis?
 MARDY FISH:   More golf, because I'm trying to pick their brain.  I'm being the super annoying guy that tries to pick their brain as much as I can and ask a lot of questions.
 But, yeah, so less tennis for me.  She didn't ask too many questions about tennis.  I'm not going to bring up the tennis unless she does.  Yeah.
