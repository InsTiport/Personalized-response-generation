 Q.  Mardy, you've played John Smoltz before, and you fared well going up against him.  Are you a little worried now that he's qualified for the Senior Open last year he might get a little better?  
MARDY FISH: No, he's a great golfer.  We've played a lot of rounds together throughout the years, and we play -- whenever they come through L.A. doing the commentary for the baseball, we usually try and play.  So I know that he's certainly tough.  It will be fun to play with him tomorrow.   
 Q.  That scene on 18, it gets pretty hectic out there.  Can you explain what it's like playing in that?  
MARDY FISH: Yeah, it's fun.  It's like normal for when I usually play.  I usually play with music and a bunch of stuff going on.  So it feels more like home.   
 Q.  What do you take from your tennis game to bring to your golf game to make you better?  
MARDY FISH: More of it's just mental, just the mental side of playing an individual game and then playing out here.  But we have fun with it.  We don't do this very often, so we take it seriously.  But deep down we know that it's just a celebrity golf tournament and we're trying to raise a lot of money for some kids.  So it's fun to be a part of.
