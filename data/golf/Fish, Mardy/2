Q. Mardy, another great round today.  Looks like you got a nice position at the top of the leaderboard.  How do you feel?
MARDY FISH:   Yeah, feels good.  Didn't play as well today as I did yesterday, but I scored better.  I made some putts and hit some good putts and they went in.  I hit some good putts yesterday and they didn't go in.  Today a few of them did.
But overall, yeah, really happy with I think it was 3-under.  You know, I'm not a pro, so that's pretty good.
Q. Yeah.  That's great.  Was there one birdie that stood out the most?
MARDY FISH:   Yeah, I was just trying to get back on track.  I made two early birdies and then a bogey on 4, and then all pars all the way through I think to 14, which starts --  or maybe 13.  No, 14, the par-3.  Yeah, made a longer putt there and just sort of got the momentum back a little bit.
Wasn't hitting it as close as I would've wanted to give me some looks, but that sort of jump started me again.  Was never really in uncomfortable situations at all.  Just didn't get too many scoring opportunities until I made a few longer putts, which was nice.
Q. And today you played with Danielle Kang.  First time you played with her?
MARDY FISH:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  Really impressive.  She shot 8-under.  Didn't make a bogey.  Made a lot of putts.  Yeah, it was really, really impressive to watch.
Q. And I don't know if you heard, Jessica Korda shot a 60 today.
MARDY FISH:   She shot 06?
Q. She shot 60 today, yep.
MARDY FISH:   So, yeah, that's unbelievable.  Yeah, there is a lot of birdies out there, but 11 -- or maybe she made some eagles, too.
Q. I think one eagle.
MARDY FISH:   Yeah, that's awesome.  They're set up to have a good round tomorrow.
