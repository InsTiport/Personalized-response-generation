 Q. Good playing there. Do you remember how many birdies you have?   
MARDY FISH: I think I had three on the front, two on the back. The front's harder than the back. It was nice to get a birdie on 9 when it was raining there. I hit it pretty close and made a putt. So, yeah, I mean, it was tough conditions for the most part, but there are also times when it was pretty nice.  
   
 Q. The wind was pretty strong?   
MARDY FISH: Yeah, I grew up in Florida, so I'm used to these types of conditions. Sometimes it's nice. Sometimes you‑‑ when you have those types of conditions, you focus in a little bit more, and I think I did that good today.  
   
 Q. This tournament in general, can you just talk about it and your past playing?   
MARDY FISH: This is always a blast. Diamond Resorts puts on an amazing event. They treat us like kings and queens. I don't know if anyone's ever said no to anything, any requests or anything like that. So it's an awesome experience. Diamond Resorts puts on a great event.  
   
 Q. And just playing with these other competitors, it's kind of fun to see the same guys.   
MARDY FISH: Yeah, and I don't know much about NASCAR, and Denny is an awesome guy. I asked him a bunch of questions, and I probably annoyed him a little bit. I'm a huge sports fans. So I love all these guys ‑‑ you know, just coming in and meeting all these guys and becoming friends with them, it's a really cool experience.   
And then playing with someone like Scott Verplank is really‑‑ I've watched him play. He's won many tournaments over the years. I watched him play growing up, and it was awesome to share a course with him too.
