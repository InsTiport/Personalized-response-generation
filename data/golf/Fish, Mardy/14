 Q.  Mardy, at the end of the round today, you're five shots back of Smoltz.  Can you sum up your round for me, please.  
MARDY FISH: Just could never really get anything going.  Pars on the first nine holes, and I had, I think, a birdie putt on 8 of the 9.  I just never made anything.  I hit it okay on the front nine, and you've got to score on these to be able to win.   
Then I kind of get behind the eight ball, and you start pressing a little bit and start realizing you're not making as many points as you should, and it turns into a round that you hit the ball pretty good overall to not a very good scoring round.   
 Q.  You're out there with female world No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, fan favorite Brooke Henderson.  How fun was it out there today?  
MARDY FISH: Yeah, it's a blast.  It was really cool to see.  I played with Brooke yesterday too.  It was nice just to watch them play and how good they are.  May is just unbelievable the way she hits the ball.  You could tell -- she didn't have her best day today, but you could tell how good she is.  So it was a blast to watch them go at it.   
 Q.  What do you think the keys to victory will be tomorrow with the little difficult weather in there?  
MARDY FISH: I need to have something low, and I need John to not play very well.  I think that's pretty much how it stands.  Five points is quite a few points.  Sort of systems up -- it's like -- if you're making eagles, it's one thing, but if you're making birdies and pars and stuff, it's kind of like stroke play.  So it's five points back, which is quite a lot for a good player like John.
