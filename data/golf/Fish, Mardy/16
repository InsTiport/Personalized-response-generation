 Q.  Mardy, earlier this week you were asked about Jack Nicklaus saying you're good enough to turn pro.  Do you think you lived up to his words today?  
MARDY FISH: No, not quite, but I don't play as much golf as he wants me to, that's for sure.  But, no, that was a pretty special day for sure, playing nine holes with him.  Pretty cool experience.   
 Q.  You had a good round today.  Can you sum it up for me, please?  
MARDY FISH: Yeah, I birdied some holes that I probably shouldn't have and parred or bogeyed some holes that I probably shouldn't have.  So it probably evened itself out fine.  Made a bunch of birdies, and last year's format with the three birdies and one -- 3 for birdies and 1 for par would have been a pretty big day, but the format's a little different now.  We're just trying to get used to it and not get behind the eight ball in the first couple rounds.   
 Q.  How do you like your chances come Sunday?  Do you think you're going to take it on this week?  
MARDY FISH: I certainly hope so.  There's a long way to go.  You know, we've never played a four-day event.  It will be interesting to see.  It's a lot of golf for us.
