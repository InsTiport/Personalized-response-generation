 Q.  Mardy, how would you describe the atmosphere out there this week?  
MARDY FISH: It's been awesome. It's always an incredible week. Diamond Resorts has gotten better and better every year. It was super cool to be a part of the first one in '16 and just stoked every year that they invite me back.   
 Q.  How do you think the tournament has evolved from 2016 until now?  
MARDY FISH: You can see it on even like Thursday. You get a bunch of fans out here, and it just wasn't like that the first couple of years. We've got some awesome names in the celebrity division and then obviously some of the best women in the world. So it makes for a fun event.   
 Q.  How would you describe your play this week?  
MARDY FISH: A little up and a little down -- and a lot of down. But it was fun to play always and hoping to be back next year.   
 Q.  Going forward to next year, what part of your game are you looking to improve on going into the tournament?  
MARDY FISH: It's always putting for me. It's always putting. I've just got to play a little bit more next time.
