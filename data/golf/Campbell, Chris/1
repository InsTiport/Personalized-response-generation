  Q. Talk about the course.   
 CHRIS CAMPBELL: It's a fantastic place. I played well, I'm putting well, I'm hitting the ball well, I'm doing the best I can.   
 But it's tough conditions for a club pro like me. I'm just trying to do the best I can. I'll just get after it and see if I can keep it going.
