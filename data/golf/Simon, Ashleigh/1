Q. So tell me about your Olympic experience so far?
ASHLEIGH SIMON: So far it's been amazing. We arrived late Sunday night, and we went down to the village to breakfast on Monday morning, and we were just both in awe of all these athletes and just kind of people watch for the first day. 
Then came out to the golf course and the golf course is fantastic. It's a lot of fun. It's a good mixture of holes. The Olympic setup is going to be really tricky. It's just a fun atmosphere. I think everybody is relaxed and all the countries are coming together for a good week.

Q. What's your sort of expectation or hope for this tournament? 
ASHLEIGH SIMON: Obviously we all hope for a medal. That's why we all come here. I think just to be competing this week is pretty special. You know, hopefully going forward, golf can grow and there will be many more Olympics.

Q. How would a medal rate in terms of your career? 
ASHLEIGH SIMON: To be honest, before this week, I never thought about it but I think since getting here, it would probably be the top of everything. Obviously we strive to win golf tournaments at majors, but I think once you get here, you actually realise how special it would be to win a medal. 

Q. Got your fiancée on the bag. How special is it to share this experience with him? 
ASHLEIGH SIMON: Yeah, it's really saw some. I mean, we've experienced so many things together; being able to see the world, and this is just really unbelievable. I don't think we ever thought this would happen, because golf was never in the Olympics. 
It's just kind of a cherry on the top to a fantastic year so far. 

Q. He caddies for you full‑time? 
ASHLEIGH SIMON: Yes.

Q. Have you set a date for the wedding? 
ASHLEIGH SIMON: 15th of December, so straight after Dubai, we get home and we get married. It will be cool.
