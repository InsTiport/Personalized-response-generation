 Q.  So we got to talk about the putt on 18.  Basically a must-make.  Talk us through it.  
BROOKE SEAY: Yeah, I was in the rough.  I hit it just over the green.  I was in the fringe when I putted.  It was about 35 feet downhill.  I knew I had to make it because she had a good look at birdie.   
So I was just kind of like picturing a line.  I wasn't thinking of distance at all.  The only thing on my mind was make it.  He told me he would give my a puppy if I made it.  That was just kind of unrelated, but kind of loosened me up.   
Yeah, so I was a little surprise that it went in, but yeah.   
 Q.  Overall a great match.  Talk about the match in general.  
BROOKE SEAY: Honestly, Grace played amazing.  That was probably the toughest match I've ever played.  We were both just firing on all cylinders and didn't really make any mistakes.   
Yeah, that was tough match.   
 Q.  Your experienced in the Girls' Junior, of course, and you're a quarterfinalist.  How does that sound?  
BROOKE SEAY: Amazing.  I mean, yeah, I've played this many times before but never made it this far.  Obviously something I've thought of for a long time.   
Yeah, I'm just so grateful to have made it this far.  Everything from here I'm just going to be enjoying it with my brother on the bag and taking it all in, yeah.
