Q. 4-down with four to play, you battled back.  What's going through your mind?
BROOKE SEAY: Yeah, I actually kind of like being in that position.  I mean, it's more pressure, but in some sense it's liberating to know you just have to hit that shot, and so something just kind of turned on, and my game started coming into place.  I just played really solid the last few holes, and she played great, so obviously it went long, but yeah.
Q. You hit it to two feet and then she knocked it in from off the green.  What's kind of the up-and-down of emotions during a match like this?
BROOKE SEAY: Just be patient and keep playing your game.
Q. You're experienced with USGA championships; it's a long week.  You've played three weeks in a row now.  What are you feeling energy-wise?
BROOKE SEAY: I feel pretty good.  I think I've learned how to manage my energy every day and making sure I get plenty of rest after and not practicing.  Being really smart after you practice after the round.  So yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.
