Q.  Well, you're still in it.
STEPHEN AMES:  It was a good day.  Like I said, the first 11 holes were really solid for me and then it kind of fell apart from there.  I started missing fairways with the driver and it was tough to make par from there.  I think I only managed three pars on the back nine, so it was very up-and-down for me there.  Overall considering the way I finished, I'm very happy with the score.
Q.  Any nerves at all going out with Jay?
STEPHEN AMES:  No, it wasn't nerves at all.  I have nothing else to prove.

I've kind of proven my year has been a breakthrough year for me, having my win at Western Open and playing here at TOUR Championship, that's another added bonus for the year altogether.
Q.  Tomorrow, what's the plan of attack?
STEPHEN AMES:  Attack.  I have nothing to lose.  I think I'm going to fire at more pins than I did today, and then from there I think I have to be a little bit more on top of my swing as the round goes on, which is I think where I fell apart today.

Okay, thanks.
