  Q.  Quarterfinal match, interesting match, methodical, back and forth.  Talk me through it all.   
 STEPHEN AMES:  Funny enough, I hit the ball better today than I did yesterday.  Yesterday I made putts and today I didn't make any putts.  So, I mean, that's the nature of the game, unfortunately.   
 The good thing about it is I took a lot of positives out of this, going into the next couple events or the rest of the year, should I say.   
 Obviously never being in this situation, going this far in the event itself, to me it showed me that there's more in me than I knew I had.  So I'm very happy with it.   
  
  Q.  Chad Campbell advances.  What do you think his chances are, and what makes him difficult going to the semifinals and perhaps the final?   
 STEPHEN AMES:  He's steady.  He's steady off the tee.  I think he hit one bad tee shot today.  He's steady off the tee.  He's got his irons under control.  He's probably going to be the pick to beat there.   
 Obviously Trevor is playing very well again, and then of course so is Henrik Stenson, another good player there.  So he's going to have his work cut out overall.
