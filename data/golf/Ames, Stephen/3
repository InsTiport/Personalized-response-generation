 Q.  How good was your round today?  
STEPHEN AMES: It was good. I'll take it, let's put it that way. It was tough going out obviously at the beginning with all the rain coming down and the golf course played really different. You're getting a lot of shots that were skidding off the green, so that took some adjusting to, and then of course we had to adjust the game when the wind stops.   
So I guess that's links golf, isn't it. But overall, it was a fun week for me. This is my second time around here, so I'm very happy with my result.   
 Q.  How special was to play 18 in front of a big crowd?  
STEPHEN AMES: Yeah, it's wonderful. It always is. I think any time you have a nice crowd that's following us, especially on the Champions Tour, gone through the PGA TOUR section already, but it's nice that we have a nice crowd following us this week.   
 Q.  Being in the top five at St. Andrews, it's been a special week for you?  
STEPHEN AMES: It has been a special week. We've had a lot of fun here. I'm looking forward to next year when it's at Lytham and St. Annes. This year, they have put on some nice events and some great golf courses to play on.   
Obviously St. Andrews, playing here at the Old Course has been a wonderful treat, and I know for a fact a lot of the guys that did come over and play are very happy that they did.
