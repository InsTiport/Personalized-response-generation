  Q. Do you have any idea what time it is and what hole you're playing and what round?  
 STEPHEN AMES: 7:30, three holes to go. Been here since 5:30. Long day. Long day. Somebody told me I had the better end of the draw. (Laughs). Scoring wise, maybe I do.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 STEPHEN AMES: They know what they have to do after two rounds of play.   
 Then they won't cut it to 54, probably cut it to 60 and ties, closest to 60. Closest to 60. And then they'll try and do 72 holes, but they probably will cut it to 60 and ties.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 STEPHEN AMES: 54 holes. That would be the last scenario. That would be probably Monday afternoon, which sitting in the clubhouse.   
  
  Q. So you think they will play Monday?  
 STEPHEN AMES: If they have to, yeah. That's the reason they'll cut it to 60 and ties. You have less worries, and you'll be able to -- but tomorrow's not a very good round. But I hear somebody looks pretty good.   
  
  Q. Today was supposed to be good too, right?  
 STEPHEN AMES: We gotta a lot of golf still to play. I thought this was Saturday.   
  
  Q. Same sort of weather for the whole weekend. Do you feel like you can, whatever you've got going you can keep going?  
 STEPHEN AMES: It's difficult. It's difficult. Stuff goes everywhere. It has been tough, mentally. Three holes to go, see what I can do tomorrow.   
 Oh, tonight. Did they call it? Oh, great. That's nice. So 7:30 tomorrow. Another early night. I'll come back and play three holes and then come back out and probably play till 4:00, 5:00.
