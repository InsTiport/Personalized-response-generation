 Q. Stephen, you had to finish your first round this morning and went straight out again for your second round. How tough was that?
 STEPHEN AMES: Pretty tough, considering I only had maybe five hours of sleep after the round and then I didn't get to bed until probably about 12:00 o'clock last night. It was tough. This week has been a tough week. This week has been tougher than it was last week considering the rain and the weather that we had to deal with. Overall I'm a little disappointed the way -- that happens with the draw sometimes.

 Q. You played extremely well at Royal Birkdale last week. Was it really tough? Did it take a lot out of you coming into this tournament?
 STEPHEN AMES: No, because physically I felt fine coming in. I think just the conditions, the way they turned out this week with the amount of rain that they've had, and the softening of the golf course made things a little tougher, or maybe just a little easier in this case. 
 For me I just couldn't get the ball rolling and just couldn't get the ball in the hole basically. But I hit the ball very well, considering, and it's unfortunate.

 Q. You're one of the few Canadians in the field this week. Did that put a lot of extra pressure on you going out there?
 STEPHEN AMES: No, I just tried to play my own game and tried to make as many birdies as I could and go from there basically.
