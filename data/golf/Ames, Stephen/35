  Q. Talk about your day?  
 STEPHEN AMES: It was solid, didn't make any mistakes to an extent and when I did I got it up-and-down, which is nice.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us about you just had two birdies?  
 STEPHEN AMES: Two birdies today.   
  
  Q. Where were they?  
 STEPHEN AMES: 2, I was in the trap, laid it up and then I hit 8-iron to about 12 feet below the hole and made that.   
 Then on 7 I hit driver, cut a 6-iron in to about two and a half feet above the hole and made the putt there.   
 Rest of the day was very soiled. A lot of birdie chances on the back nine that didn't go in.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts going into tomorrow?  
 STEPHEN AMES: I hope it doesn't dry up any more.
