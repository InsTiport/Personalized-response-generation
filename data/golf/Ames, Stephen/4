Q. Very long day for you, but it is perhaps a golfers dream to play more than 18 holes in one day at the Old Course?
STEPHEN AMES: It was 19 but that's okay, yeah.  For me, this is only my second trip around here, so yeah, it's always a treat to come back and play here, especially when the weather has been like it has been.
Q. Scoring was difficult today.  How proud of your round are you to be in contention with the winds blowing?
STEPHEN AMES: It was definitely a day of hanging around, that's for sure.  I didn't play as well as I'd like to, obviously.  The quirkiness of the golf course, if you don't know the lines off the tees where you need to hit and where you need to miss them, it makes for a long day and a very difficult day.  Today we kind of fought through a lot of the holes together with the caddie.  We did make some mistakes which is going to happen, and I felt like overall, it was a day of just hanging around.
Q. Do you feel these conditions make it easier for someone to come-from-behind with this wind?
STEPHEN AMES: No chance.  I think guys have to be patient and staying in front.  Miguel obviously is playing very well, which is nothing new.  So it's going to be a day of hanging around and see if you can make a couple birdies and catch him.
