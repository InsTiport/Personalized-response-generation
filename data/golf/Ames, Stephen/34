  Q. Talk about your day.   
 STEPHEN AMES: It was a good. It was a bit up-and-down. But otherwise it was a solid round. I hit the ball well. When I did miss the greens I couldn't get it up-and-down because I missed them on the wrong side, unfortunately. But overall I was happy to break par again, obviously.   
  
  Q. Was it nice to play early?  
 STEPHEN AMES: It wasn't too bad. I have the rest of the day to relax and do whatever I want now. But, yeah, it's nice.   
  
  Q. Was the wind a factor at all?  
 STEPHEN AMES: It's starting to become a factor, yeah, on some holes.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing?  
 STEPHEN AMES: I think overall the golf course is playing fair, they're definitely getting firmer and faster, so it's going to be a lot more fun, if it stays like this for the weekend.   
  
  Q. How were the pin positions?  
 STEPHEN AMES: A lot more accessible than they were yesterday. Definitely.
