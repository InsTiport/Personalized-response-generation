STEPHEN AMES:  Quite happy with the way things have worked out.
Q.  How much would it mean to win Arnie's event?
STEPHEN AMES:  A lot.  It's Arnie's event, it's Bay Hill, one of the best events obviously on TOUR, and I think you can tell by the quality of the field that's playing in it.
Q.  Are you surprised at the way things have played out in the West Coast Swing and here in Florida?  Weather-wise it's been a strange season so far.
STEPHEN AMES:  It has been a strange season.

Let's put this way, it could have been worse.
