Q. Two birdies to finish in the top 10, so a pretty good day.
STEPHEN AMES: Yeah, it was a good day considering that I had to play the back nine by myself.  I don't mind playing by myself, I just wish I was at the beginning of the group, not the middle of the pack.  But it worked out well.  We paced ourselves very nicely, and we only had to wait on one hole, which was 18, so that was excellent.
Q. Talk about the way you played today.
STEPHEN AMES: I thought I played really solid.  I hit one push-out, which was on 4, and it cost me triple bogey there.  Other than that, I thought I played very cautiously, how you're supposed to play a U.S. Open, middle of the greens, make your 20-footers.  Got out of there, and when the opportunities arrived with a closer shot, or approach shot that was closer, I made the putts.  So I think overall if I took that hole out of the day, I think I played extremely well.  Very happy the way I played this week.
