Q. How good was that round?
STEPHEN AMES: It was solid.  Hit a lot of fairways and made a lot of putts, which is nice.
Q. How nice is it to be back in St. Andrews playing a major tournament?
STEPHEN AMES: Major tournament, I've only played here one major tournament, which is '05.  The weather was beautiful back then from what I remember.  Yes, it's always fun to be back here at St. Andrews.
Q. How good to get off to a good start?
STEPHEN AMES: It's a good feeling to get off to a good start.  I worked hard this week trying to familiarise myself with the golf course and it's amazing how different it was back in '05 compared to what it is now.  I guess it goes with age; we all change with age.
And I worked this week, also, very hard on my long putts, which is a big key out here on this golf course.  It paid off today.
Q. The back nine is tough playing into the wind.  You played well on the back nine?
STEPHEN AMES: I did.  You always look at 17 and play it as a par 5.  If you make four out of it, you feel like you birdied it.  I played the back nine well today which is fun.
