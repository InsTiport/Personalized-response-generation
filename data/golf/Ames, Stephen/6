Q. I would appreciate it, if you wouldn't mind, just how you've been passing the time today?
STEPHEN AMES: Oh, you don't want to know that.  I am definitely not giving that one an answer.
FEMALE: No quote from his girlfriend.
STEPHEN AMES: No, not at all.  I watched a movie and sat in the hotel room.  Just looking at the day itself and then watching the weather all day, it was kind of obvious that we weren't going to be playing much golf.
I think the fact that they kind of jumped the ball at 3:30, saying we're teeing it up, I even thought that was a bit far-fetched.  Anyway, I think it's a good decision.
We'll see what happens tomorrow.  Hopefully the weather --
Q. All the rain and all the weather, how do you think the course is going to play differently now?
STEPHEN AMES: Well, it's going to play a little longer, a little softer, which, I don't know, will help everybody in the front, I guess.  In some respects, you can't catch them.  So I guess we'll see what happens.  But then, again, somebody can go really low too.  Hopefully, that will be one of us around here.
At this stage right now, we're just going to do the best we can and hopefully get it done tomorrow, and then we can all go home because it is a week off for us next week.
Q. So how do you sort of -- what's your -- how do you prepare now mentally, physically, to go back out tomorrow?
STEPHEN AMES: Well, at this stage right now, I'm just enjoying the beautiful wine that they're offering here for us, and we're going to enjoy the evening.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend's leaving this evening, so I'm going to be by myself.  So I'll just have to stay in the room, have room service, and watch a movie.  Very relaxed.
