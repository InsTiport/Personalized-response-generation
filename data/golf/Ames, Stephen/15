  Q. Yeah, so you're into the lead on Friday. Just talk a little bit about your round.   
 STEPHEN AMES: Made putts, shall we say, one thing. I made some putts yesterday, too, but I didn't hit the ball as close as I did today. And capitalized on it.   
 I think also the fact that the conditions are a little tougher today than they were yesterday afternoon, or even in the whole day yesterday. So 66 is a good round today. Henrik played well, myself, the other group. I think it was just a case of being patient and waiting for it to happen.   
  
  Q. You talked a little bit about conditions. What was the main difference, just the wind or --  
 STEPHEN AMES: More landing off the wind because we played in the afternoon yesterday after the rains came, and it was just dead calm. And they had a little bit of wind yesterday morning, but I don't think as much as this.   
 And I think some holes played easier. Obviously some holes are going to play a little tougher. I enjoyed the tougher holes.  
  
  Q. Bigger picture, where are you right now, just game wise, or swing wise?  
 STEPHEN AMES: Ego talking here, I'm not happy with the way I'm hitting the golf ball, to be honest. It feels okay. I was able to really get rid of it in my feelings and continue playing golf, which is what I have to do, if I'm going to be successful or continue playing well.   
 My short game feels good and my putter feels really good right now. It's just that's always been my down fall. So it's just going to go right to the putter.   
  
  Q. Any expectations about tomorrow's round?  
 STEPHEN AMES: I have zero expectations. I hope the sun's out, the wind's blowing and I can work on my tan.
