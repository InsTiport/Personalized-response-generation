Q.  A couple rounds in, are you getting more comfortable, feeling like you're playing a little better now?
STEPHEN AMES:  No, I'm just getting luckier with the wonderful lies that we're getting in the rough out here.  (Laughing).  I'm dead serious, that's what it is.  Just getting luckier and luckier as the round is going on.
Q.  Do you think it's fair, the golf course?
STEPHEN AMES:  To be truthful, no, I don't.  I think the fairway rough is fair.  It's even, it's not patchy like it is around the greens.

Around the greens, horrendous as far as I'm concerned.  And when you talk to the owners and the director of Shaughnessey, they are like, yeah, they know they have that problem because they have about five or six different grasses growing around the greens.  Something that should have been probably taken care of three years ago when they decided to have the Open here.  But we won't blame any names on that one.
Q.  Are you happy with where you're at after two days?
STEPHEN AMES:  Yeah, I am.  Today I played very well.  I had a lot of opportunities, a couple up ands down that were really good, and other than that I hit the ball really well.

Disappointed the way I finished, obviously, to finish bogey, bogey, to finish even for the day.  Overall, even par on this golf course is a good round so, happy with it.
Q.  Is this course playing any different today than it was?
STEPHEN AMES:  No, still the same.  I think the wind is going to blow this afternoon and the scores are going to go up.  Could get high.  Calcavecchia is obviously playing well and the guys still have the afternoon round to catch him.  I think overall it will play the same as it did yesterday.
