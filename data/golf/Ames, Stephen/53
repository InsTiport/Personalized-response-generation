 Q.  Do you like this golf course -- 
 STEPHEN AMES:  When it's wet, maybe.  Not when it's firm.  It's playing benign obviously because of the conditions.  They are soft out there.  The 3-irons that I'm going in with are stopping quick compared to everybody else is hitting 6-iron. 
 So, yeah, more wet makes it easier. 

 Q.  How did the golf course change during the day because the weather kept changing? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  Yeah, it did.  It played tougher.  13 I think we were up almost ten yards and it was playing 213 to the hole.  We all hit 3-irons and all came up short.  It played tough out there.  There's some holes that played very tough and you've just got to scramble around and get your pars which is basically what we all did. 

 Q.  With the weather the way it's been, is the rough going to get that much worse?  Is it going to be that much more important to keep the ball in the fairway this weekend? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  Definitely, I'm sure it is.  They are not going to cut it, so it's going to keep growing.  And I think this sunshine is out for the weekend, so yeah, it's going to get tougher as the week goes on. 

 Q.  Do you feel good about the way you're playing? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  No. 

 Q.  Why not?  You've gotten off to bad starts both days, but you've had some good runs, too. 
 STEPHEN AMES:  I've had some good runs, that's about it.  I haven't hit the ball exceptionally well this week at all.  Kept it in play.  Iron play is actually very weak, but like I said up and down, which has been good for me this week.  And I can't complain; I'm scoring.
