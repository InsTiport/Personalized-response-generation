 Q.  7-under par, frustrated or happy? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  I'm happy, considering I've had two months off coming into here and haven't had much practice.  And the way I've hit it and played, I'm quite content with the way I finished this week. 

 Q.  Did you think 7-under would be enough? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  I did.  I thought 17, 18 -- Jim and I were saying we thought 17 would be the number, and some of the guys took it a little lower than we expected, but that's golf, and still a very good outcome. 

 Q.  Your thoughts heading into the season?  It's got to feel good. 
 STEPHEN AMES:  It does.  It's a nice start, starting here.  I'm looking forward to Waialae next week, Honolulu, and we'll go from there. 

 Q.  Obviously you want to get back here next year, but the date change, actually it's five days later next year, starting on the 8th, do you like that because it gives you a little space between New Year's and the holidays?  But heck, you guys were out here anyway, right? 
 STEPHEN AMES:  I'll be here from the 19th onwards.  You know what, that just gives me an even bigger break, a longer break.  We're going to be here for Christmas.  We already booked it for next year, so I'll be here whether I'm playing golf or not playing golf.
