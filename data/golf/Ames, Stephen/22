 Q. First man to get it in at 9-under par.
 STEPHEN AMES: I probably played the same as I did yesterday. Hit the ball really well, capitalized on some putts, but that's obviously been my downfall in the past, but this week it's been really solid.

 Q. Sometimes you dial in the irons. You get it going with the irons better than anybody in the game. 
 STEPHEN AMES: Thank you.

 Q. Is that what's going on this week?
 STEPHEN AMES: Yeah. I've been dialing my irons in really well, hitting a lot of really good iron shots and giving myself as many opportunities as we need out here. And that's probably why I've done so well today.

 Q. With the crowded leaderboard, does that change your philosophy going into a final?
 STEPHEN AMES: No. Same procedure, hit as many fairways as I can, and basically depends on what I need to do in some respects. When the number is not right you play a little right or a little left. In the past when I've played, what I've shot these last two days (indiscernible.)

 Q. Are you having fun these weeks?
 STEPHEN AMES: Oh, yeah, always. 

 Q. Got to feel good going into the final round?
 STEPHEN AMES: Yeah, I'm happy with the way I've come about over the last two days. After the first day, but things have turned around nicely for me. 
 We've got one more day to go. 

 Q. How is the course playing today?
 STEPHEN AMES: The course is playing nicely, the wind is up a little bit, which is nice, a different direction than what we were used to, but at the same time there's some that are easier than some in the past and some are tougher than normal.

 Q. Looking at the leaderboard, what does that make for a Sunday? It's going to be exciting. 
 STEPHEN AMES: There's going to be definite excitement. Great viewing for television, and that's what we need here.
