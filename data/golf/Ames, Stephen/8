Q.   What are your overall thoughts on how things went today on the course?
STEPHEN AMES:   It was good.   I played well.   I expected to make a couple bogeys, with the wind and the some of the pin placements, but it's expected.   So I played well overall though.   I was happy with it.

Q.   Now being towards the top of the leaderboard, what's your mentality heading into the weekend?
STEPHEN AMES:   Mentality?   Fire at every flag.   Have as much fun as I normally do.   Nothing's going to change.
