 Q.   Lots of birdies on the way home?  
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I was very pleased with the finish.   The beginning was a little rough, a few rookie mistakes I have to say, 12 and 14 left in the water, you shouldn't do that.   So 5‑under is pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Your kind of course?   
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I always loved it here.   Your wedges, they have to be really in sync and I was working on those yesterday because the wedge game wasn't good in the practice rounds.   Greens are a little slower than I was used to in the States now, so I left a few short.   
So I'm going to have to work on that, on the pace a little bit, but otherwise, very happy and enjoying myself.  
   
 Q.   You'd better expand why we haven't seen you for a while, because we saw you, Top‑10 at The Scottish Open and nothing much since over this part of the world?  
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I tried to get kind of a category in the States.   I played the Web.com final, four tournaments there, so I missed out all the nice tournaments in Europe, so to say, which was pretty hard for me, as well.   
But we have a few tournaments here in the season which are prize money‑wise, not that big, so I thought if I get my card over there and I put those bigger tournaments in the States than the weeks in Europe, it would be great.   Didn't work out, but that's okay.   I learned a lot there and I'm really, really happy to be back here on The European Tour now and see all my friends.  
   
 Q.   Did you benefit from the experience?   
MARCEL SIEM:   I hope so.   My confidence level is not as high as before I left, because Top‑10 in the Scottish Open, was not too bad and then go there and miss three cuts out of four, so it was nice to shoot 5‑under today to get my bit of confidence back.   It's all good.
