  MARCEL SIEM:   It was a tough day out there.   I played really nicely actually, the first seven holes.   I was always inside Alex and he was 4‑under and I was level par.   It was a little weird.   I had a lot better chances and he holed a lot of good putts, and started getting frustrated out there.   
Tried my best, held my nerves together I think.   I think on 10 maybe a lot of my head, tried to hit a safe fade to the fairway on 10 and just pulled it.   Didn't hole a putt all day today, so 18 was the best example there.   Thought I had it; would have been cool in front the crowd to hole that putt.   Didn't work out.   Maybe everything drops tomorrow and I still have a chance.  
   
 Q.   Your third sub‑70 round, you do certainly have a chance; you're nicely positioned.   
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I don't really know what's going on on the board.   I didn't have a look.   I'm three shots behind Alex, and, yeah, there's a deep round in tomorrow, you never know what's happening.   Definitely going to try as hard as possible to shoot a very low round tomorrow.
