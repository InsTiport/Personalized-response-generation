  MARCEL SIEM:   I played pretty solid on the front nine.   I couldn't hole a putt.   I got a bit upset because I played like last week, very steady, and I hit driver on 9, that was I think the only, mistake I made, and should have been a 3‑wood because trees come into play and made bogey there, 1‑over and felt like I should have been 2‑ or 3‑under.   Miss‑read a few putts unfortunately.   I said, let's shoot 5‑under on the back nine; shot 6‑under, so happy.   
   
 Q.   Describe your second shot to 14 out of the rough.   
MARCEL SIEM:   That was a great number.   It's 110 club and I was down off the left, flag off the right and I knew with a good one it's going to pitch flag high.   I said, come on, be right, and it hit the flag.   I guess I didn't hole that many putts but that was my first stiff one today and was pretty happy about that.  
   
 Q.   Seventh at the BMW PGA, you follow‑up with a 12th at the U.S. Open, your best in a major.   Has something clicked in the game?   
MARCEL SIEM:   I said it a few times, I was injured, I didn't hit a golf ball for six weeks after the World Cup and came without practice Abu Dhabi.   I was looking for my confidence to finish between 40th and 50th all the time.   Did a few things with GÃ¼nter and working on my technique all the time.   
I just needed a good round and a good tournament, and I think Wentworth was the one.   My putting is a lot better than the other years, as well, and my whole game is steady.   Good ones are coming now, my home tournament, French that I won.   Haven't qualified for The Open yet, so I need to crank it up and I need a good finish the next three weeks, and who knows what happens then.  
   
 Q.   BMW International in your home country next week; your wife is pregnant and due any day.   
MARCEL SIEM:   Yes, she is.   I feel sorry for her because she can't be with me at the moment.   You know, in the summertime, being pregnant is not that nice I reckon.   On Monday, we're going to get the baby, we know that, and I'm really looking forward to that.   Going to be a special week for me, home tournament, the second baby.   Got the shivers already, it's really cool.
