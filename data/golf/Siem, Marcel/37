Q.   Well played today, just talk me through that a little bit. 
MARCEL SIEM:   It was a little tough.   I had to show some patience.   I think I had 31 holes without a birdie, and from the first round until the 9th today.   And that's a little unusual.   Usually I make a lot of birdies and a lot of bogeys, but then I just made 16 pars yesterday and a triple and a bogey. 
Today, played nicely again, and couldn't get the ball in the hole on the front nine, and on the 9th, I chipped it to like that, so I can't miss that anymore.   It was the first birdie. 
And from that point on, started holing putts again, which was nice, and just one little mistake on 17.   I wasn't sure if my 7‑iron was going to get on top there, and I just ripped it so hard and pull‑hooked it and it was over the green and just made a bogey there. 
Nice birdie to finish.   Quite happy now.   I'm back in the tournament. 

Q.   You really are back in the hunt now. 
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, like I said I made 16 pars, a triple and a bogey on both the par 5s, and I know the game was still in there and the putter just has to get going again. 
Yeah, really happy.   If somebody runs away, it's over, but Top‑5 is always a good result and at least I have a chance to play on a good golf course again tomorrow.
