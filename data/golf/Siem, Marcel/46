  Q. Well played today. What's it like with all that support and the birdies just starting to roll in?  
 MARCEL SIEM: Yeah, it's very nice, especially it's my home course, and I know quite a lot of people here, and the support is just great, I think the most spectators we've ever had here on the Thursday and Friday. Especially when I chipped in for eagle on 11, that was great. It felt a little bit like the U.S. Open when I chipped in on 15. It was nice. There was no high-fives, though, but it was good. Step by step. My big goal is to have four good rounds in a row. I didn't have that this year so far. It's good.  
  
  Q. You have a lot of history here. Just explain to people how far back you go with this golf course.   
 MARCEL SIEM: Yeah, I think it was between my 9th and 13th -- between when I was 9 and 13 I grew up here. My parents had the golf restaurant and I was fishing just behind the pitching green there and on 16 and 18. So all the people know me since I'm a little guy, so it's really nice. I know this course so well, and I was always struggling. My best result was eighth here. But this year I've stayed calm so far, even when I hit a few bad shots.   
 I usually always put myself so much under pressure here when I play, and I think after last week at the U.S. Open I came here a little bit more relaxed than usual. Usually I come here on Sunday and practice, practice, practice, have three practice rounds, and I was a little bit in a rush this year, so I think it was good for me.
