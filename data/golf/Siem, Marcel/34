Q.   To what extent were you affected by the conditions and the delay because of the lightning threat?
MARCEL SIEM:   I had just made double‑bogey before that.   Then on 18, would have been my first shot after the lightning.   I was a bit steamy there, and actually it was good for me I reckon that we got called off the course.   I hit a good shot on 18.   I had a birdie chance there.   Didn't make it, and on the first I hit it pretty close and made that luckily.   Was a 2‑putt birdie on the third.   Missed a short one on 4.   5th, I hit a long one for birdie.   7, that was a three‑meter putt, as well, for birdie and 9, it was pin‑high on my second shot and didn't get the up‑and‑down. 
The greens here, you always have to chip up the green and they are very firm.   It not easy.   Quite happy.

Q.   We had technical problems and the leaderboard was not updated.   Did you notice that during your round? 
MARCEL SIEM:   They got me in the end at minus six.   The last three holes they had me there.   At the beginning of the round, I was wondering why the scores were not moving.   But you shouldn't care about that anyways.   You should play golf. 
The only thing I know is the last four holes, we were on the clock all of a sudden and we had to rush a lot.   I was a bit stressed out after the last four holes to be honest.

Q.   So with the lightning nearby and the rain coming in afterwards and the leaderboard freezing, it was not an ordinary day; so did you feel that you had to play an unordinary round, too? 
MARCEL SIEM:   If you shoot a few under on the golf course, doesn't matter what are the conditions, it's a good score.   I've shot two times 3‑under now, so I'm very happy and I hope I keep it going like that. 

Q.   With the conditions you were playing under today, how happy are you?
MARCEL SIEM:   I'm very happy.   I think we had four seasons a day like in Ireland we had.   It was not as bad as Ireland.   It was a lot warmer so we just had the rain jacket on for two holes, which was nice actually.   Quite happy that they called us in. 
I had just made a double on 17, and I was a bit steamy again.   Yeah, called us in and kept playing nicely after that.   Holed the putts, as well, on the front nine, or my back nine.   And quite happy.   A little bit tired.   It was a long day.

Q.   6‑under par after two rounds going into the weekend, an excellent result.   How happy are you about it? 
MARCEL SIEM:   I'm very happy.   It's always nice to be up the leaderboard.   I don't know if it's enough to be in the last group, because the leaderboards are not working.   I think so; looked like when I signed, there's only a few guys on 4‑under. 
Yeah, it's great feeling to be up there again, and just try to stay calm for the last two days and play the golf I played, and the putter has got to be hot and hope it's going to be enough this time. 

Q.   Sounds like the delay for the thunderstorm worked for your benefit?
MARCEL SIEM:   This time it did.   I usually don't like that, especially when I was 1‑under.   But I was quite happy actually.   Made a double on 17, and was downwind on 18, and I thought it was going to be a little easier with the downwind, just a 3‑wood and 9‑iron or something like that. 
But it was all right.   I went in the player's lounge, talked to my physio, Martin was in there, his father, Laura, my fiancÃ©e, was there.   We had a good time there and chilled out a bit and it got me in a better mood again.   Kept on playing nicely after that.   It was okay.   It was to my benefit in a way.

Q.   I take it the weather conditions were better for you, more conducive afterwards?
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, definitely were.   It was nearly flat calm in the end.   On the last four holes, there was a little breeze off the left, half a club of wind.   It was very comfortable and nice to play and I'm really happy that I made something out of it.
