Q. How has your week been, because it is a tidy result, isn't it?
MARCEL SIEM: Yeah, I'm very pleased with everything, and I worked hard in the winter, new coach and mental coach and it's nice when the hard work pays off in a way.  Yeah, I'm very, very pleased.
Q. Well you certainly worked hard last year but I know at the end of the year, you were saying it wasn't the most satisfying 2015?
MARCEL SIEM: No, not at all.  Went over to America, practicing a lot there and I was just working on the wrong stuff I think.  Yeah, I'm just really, really happy that it went this way.  Feels great, the ball-striking feels unbelievable right now and my putting got a lot better.
Yeah, my new caddie is awesome, as well.  He's one of the best green readers I've ever had.  It's a lot of fun at the moment.
Q. So this is a re-dedication, knowing it's a new year and you can start afresh?
MARCEL SIEM: I'm 35 years old now.  I'm not a youngster on Tour.  So I had to make a few decisions.  I've got hopefully ten more good years in me.  But it looks a bit -- I made a good decisions in the winter finally.
