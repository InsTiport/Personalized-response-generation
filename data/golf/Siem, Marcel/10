 Q.   What's your verdict on the fourth spot?   
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I was sandwiched there a little bit.   Didn't what I had to do, I tried to make birdies in the end.   I knew I had three shots to the fifth place and tried to make birdie and had a few good chances.   Didn't drop unfortunately.   But those guys played very steady and there was no chance.   Very happy with fourth, good start to the season.   I don't know if that gets me close to the Top‑50 again for the Masters next year, but whatever.   
Definitely not playing anymore this year and trying to do the job in the Middle East maybe.   
   
 Q.   And essentially you can look back on a wonderful autumn to the year and you're right, it is a good start to the new Race to Dubai?  
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, definitely.   I'm very pleased, and I played really good golf today.   I had one bogey, a 3‑putt, and that was my best goal the whole week actually.   Great 5‑iron into the last, and going with a very, very good mood into the plane now and going home and can't wait to see my family and my little daughters.
