   MARCEL SIEM: I thought the pins were harder today but you're coming from the rough and you look where the wind is, you see before the ball -- -- you miss it, you're dead and it's difficult, there's no real safe side.  
  
  Q. Well played.   
 MARCEL SIEM: Thank you. Very, very happy. Had a tough year last year, it's the fourth, last week of consistent golf being on a tough course, and starting tomorrow -- I don't know why, hit the driver properly, missed a few short putts, I still think 1-under is a good score. The weather is good but it's one of the toughest courses we play.   
 I have to say, my iron shots are better than I've ever hit them before. Just have to work on my driving a little bit, fading too much, and you know, just the putting was not as good as yesterday. But the greens today were really difficult to read, so a couple breaks, it's just a question of confidence on the course, as well. I still have to improve.   
  
  Q. Same coach?   
 MARCEL SIEM: He always he told me -- just start hitting the ball because your clubface is open anyway, so I was afraid of that, because if you go from the draw to the fade, it's a big change.   
 I played badly the last four or five years and then broke out a few months ago. I can't wait for next week, and I think the Top-10 gave me a big pump up. That's one of our favourite tournaments, I want to take part in that and I'm really happy and thankful.
