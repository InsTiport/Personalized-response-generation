 Q.   How are you doing, "Dad"?   Should you even be here?   
MARCEL SIEM:   Very good question.   I have to be here, and my wife said, the kid is healthy, she's healthy, so go on and win this tournament for us.   She's supporting me a lot.   So I'm very happy and lucky to have a wife like that, and it's all good.   I'm feeling great actually, a little tired.  
   
 Q.   Everything's gone well?   
MARCEL SIEM:   Fantastic, yeah.   I got the baby because we had a C‑section, and she had to get stitched and stuff like that, so I got the baby fresh out of the oven, so to say, onto my chest.   That was fantastic.   It was the best feeling ever.   
   
 Q.   Presumably your mind is in another place.   Are you ready to play golf?   Are you ready to work?   
MARCEL SIEM:   Today I wasn't to be honest.   I was just‑‑ felt like I was flying over the golf course.   Wasn't really concentrated and I'm a little tired, as well, but we'll be all right.   We'll be all right.  
It was two hard weeks, U.S. Open and Ireland, and I need some rest, that's the only thing.   I'm going to have a big nap this afternoon and I will be all right tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   And everything has been planned, because as we said in Ireland, this is important to you; France next week important to you, as well.   
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, big time.   My wife said, the kid is healthy, go on, no problem to play the next two weeks.   After that, depends if I qualify for The Open.   If I get the job done this week or next week, I might skip Scotland and just play the Open and then I have three weeks off after that.   
So it will be quality time for my whole family.   
   
 Q.   I have to ask you about Gut LÃ¤rchenhof, how is it?   
MARCEL SIEM:   It's nice and juicy on the fairways and rough, and the greens are firmer than usual, which is good.   I think it's a good test and the wind is up already.   I think I shot 2‑under today, and it felt tough to me, definitely tougher than usual, and I think it's a great setup.   It's going to be a good week.
