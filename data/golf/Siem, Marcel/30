Q.   Give us the highlights from your point of view?
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, I played pretty steady.   I didn't drive it as nice as yesterday to be honest.   I holed a few nice putts.   I think my 7‑iron was the best club in the bag today.   I hit a few of those pretty close.   The wedges were good and yeah, I will be happy in a moment again.

Q.   Disappointed with a 6 at the last and sounds like you didn't know the water was there?
MARCEL SIEM:   Yeah, it was perfect yardage for my 5‑wood, and I just wanted to cut it against the wind and I thought the better leave was going to be back left. 
First time I played here, practise rounds, I was always on the right side.   I've never been on the left and I thought the lake on the left side, I saw it sits where the water finish.   The guys said it's going all the way around the green, and by then, I knew the ball was in the water.   I mean, it was not a good shot‑‑ it was not an excuse, but if I would have known the water on the left, the miss is on the right, and I played well enough today to make sure I'm not going to hit it left. 
So I'm really disappointed with that.   It's a bit of a stupid rookie mistake.   Should have done my homework.
