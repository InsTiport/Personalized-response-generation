Q.   What is the verdict on the Turkish Airlines Open and how it's panned out? 
MARCEL SIEM:   It was all right.   I would have taken it I think again the week before. 
Very disappointed.   I played actually pretty good and didn't hole one putt.   Yeah, very disappointed. 

Q.   How are you physically?   I know something happened this morning. 
MARCEL SIEM:   I went in the gym this morning at 7.00 and warmed up, and then we did a bit of stretching, and something we haven't done for a year now because of my surgeries, I couldn't really do it, and dislocated my rib.   I thought I can't even tee it up. 
Then my physio tried to crack it back in, didn't work and now we went so see the chiropractic and they pushed it back in, and I had like 1,600 milligrams of Ibuprofen in now.   I couldn't have a proper back swing. 
But I played all right.   I don't want to blame it on anything to be honest.   I played all right.   I hit a lot of greens, had great birdie chances.   Just didn't hole a putt. 

Q.   As for The Race to Dubai chase, I know you were very realistic about it all along but I daresay disappointment about that. 
MARCEL SIEM:   A little, especially the way I played, even with a dislocated rib.   I think I played good enough to get to 17‑ or 18‑under today, but I didn't hole one putt.   Caught the edges all the time and misread a few and didn't have shaky hands or something.   It was great putts I hit all day.   Just didn't go in.   It was not my day. 
Sorry for everybody.   It's not that interesting now, Race to Dubai.   Congrats, Rory.   But overall, I really have to be very, very happy about the season now.   Go to Dubai and try to win there.
