 Q.   It's boosted you so much up that leaderboard, just one shot?  
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, was thinking should be birdieing the last hole today really and disappointed it didn't go in, but it's one of them where you can make a par and at the end of the day you look back on where you could have made a birdie or eagle.  
   
 Q.   Good week, therefore, on the back of all those trials at the U.S. Open?   
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, a bit of confidence after last week with a decent finish, and it's nice to know that you can have a couple of bad rounds and the confidence still there for next week.  
   
 Q.   How much do you think the U.S. Open has done for you?   
JOHN PARRY:   It's done a lot.   Made me think I'm a better golfer than I thought I was, playing with some top players, I know I can compete and gives you a boost.  
Even though you should be free every week, you feel like you can attack the pins a bit more here, and I feel that I made the same amount of birdies on the first day as I did all week last week.   
   
 Q.   Bode well for the season ahead?  
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, I hope so, and it's a good time to hit a bit of form, as well.   There's a lot of golf and a lot of big tournaments.
