Q.   A nice week, all told? 
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, it's better than I thought it would be, my fourth attempt here and I've never made the cut before.   So for me, that was a bonus, and then to finish it off like I did today was nice.

Q.   You had a lovely group from the very start, Espen Kofstad going on and leading, Paul McGinley alongside you, must have been a bit of fun. 
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, it's good, when you sort of drag each other along over the first two days, especially Espen, 7‑under, and you know it's possible.   Just a nice group when you're all playing well. 

Q.   I know it's a long, running race, this thing, but did your thoughts turn to Ryder Cup briefly? 
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, I guess you sort of think in the back of your head, he's Ryder Cup captain, you play well, it's always good standing, but after that, you just carry on with your game really.

Q.   And after that, your game has gone from strength‑to‑strength, because you're in a lovely position on that board. 
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, I exactly, I was hoping to squeeze into the Top‑10 this week because I wasn't into next week yet, so that's an added bonus that I can play next week. 

Q.   And next week is a joy up the mountains. 
JOHN PARRY:   Yeah, that's probably one of my favourite, if not event of the year, so looking forward to it.
