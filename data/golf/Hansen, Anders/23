   ANDERS HANSEN: I didn't feel I played that great today. I played very good yesterday. Today was a tough day out there. The wind was different than we've seen it all week, so I think maybe that threw me off a little bit because I couldn't quite find the rhythm in the long game, couldn't quite find the lines. The short game bailed me out and I'm very happy with that because Nick my caddie and I have put a lot of work into trying to get that right over the last week. So that was really nice.
