 Q.   Just wanted to get a couple of comments because you are one of the low rounds this morning.   How is the course playing out there today?   Is it playing a little easier?   
ANDERS HANSEN:   I think the pins are pretty much as you expect it to be on a Sunday, as we have seen through the years, not that I have been here.   But the course is playing quite good.   The greens are running smooth, as you expect, and it's nothing unexpected.   It's a bit ‑‑ the fairways are dryer, so not so many mud balls, which is really nice.   It makes it a little easier.  
   
 Q.   What was the key to your round?   Are you happy with your final round at the Masters?  
ANDERS HANSEN:   For me, I'm really pleased with it.   I'm really, really pleased with it.   I played really, really solid from tee to green and made a few putts.   Didn't make any major mistakes, which is a big thing at Augusta.
