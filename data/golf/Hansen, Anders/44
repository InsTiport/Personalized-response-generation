ANDERS HANSEN:  The putter was struggling today. It was a nice one to finish with. I didn't play that well at the start and then I had some really good chances. Just nothing went in. Just one of those days.  The putter was so good those early days. That's the way I look at it.
Q.  The two days of playing in the final group, must give you great confidence
ANDERS HANSEN:  I thought today I would put up a pretty good fight.  I felt I played quite nicely.  I thought I lost momentum when I couldn't get the putts in and then made one or two, some close ones, but you never know.
Q.  So three weeks on, three weeks off?
ANDERS HANSEN:  Yeah.
