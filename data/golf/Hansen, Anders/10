Q.   You said it was messy? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   It was messy to start with and something actually happened and I played quite nicely from there on in.   The weather was messy.   It wasn't very nice out there. 
But it just seemed like it got a bit more cold as the hours went by, and it just got a bit more windy and then the rain came in, and then it all stopped as we were walking up the last hole. 

Q.   And this is after the promise of sunshine and good weather this week?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Everybody's been saying it's going to be such good weather this week.   It was good for the first two days, Tuesday and Wednesday.   So hopefully the next couple of days are going to be nice.

Q.   We haven't spoken for a little while; what's been going on? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I haven't played a lot this year.   I had some things I wanted to do privately and that seems to be going a little better.   Now I'm going to play this week and next week and then I have a little operation in my hand, and then I'm going to be out for a little while.
So this year is going to be a little messy, but hopefully I'll try to salvage as much as I possibly can. 

Q.   What's up with the hand? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I've been struggling for a long time with it, and just came to a point as where the cortisone didn't really kick in anymore, and now I need an operation, otherwise, I just can't keep playing. 

Q.   But you can cope with it day‑to‑day at the moment?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, I got an injection now a couple weeks ago and that should last me until the operation in two weeks, so I'll be all right.
