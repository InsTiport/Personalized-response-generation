Q.   I take it that's a move in the right direction on one of your favourite courses. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   It's a good score.   It's tough out there, it's really tough.   It's blowing more than it did yesterday and it's just tough. 

Q.   We always expect it to be tough, and a fellow Dane made it look easy yesterday. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   That 10‑under blew my mind yesterday.   I was like, whoa, what's happening here, that's got to be one of the best rounds.   62 out here is very good. 
You know, yesterday I was a bit blown away by it, but today got it going and just got to play your own game and see what happens. 

Q.   Is the difficulty out there what we normally expect, the fact that it's a tree‑lined course and the wind is swirling and that sort of thing?   We have rain now. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   You have to trust the wind and you have got to pick a wind and trust it.   The greens are pretty tough out there.   You have to pick a line and hope it goes well. 

Q.   Is this generally a firm step in the right direction, seeing your name back on boards, which is good after all the layoff you had. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Last season was a tough season.   I was injured and had two surgeries, but got that out of the way and played four events so far.   The first two I was not happy but the last two events were really good. 

Q.   You say getting out of the way; is it all healed?   Is it all up and correct? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I don't think it will ever be.   It's just one of those things, I'm not young anymore.   I've been doing this for a long, long time and I'm throbbing a little bit on my right hand now, but we'll see what happens.
