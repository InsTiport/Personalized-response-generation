 Q.   Give us your thoughts on that round, pretty decent start.   
ANDERS HANSEN:   Pretty happy with that.   We are still in it.   Australia is playing great up there, but I think we played pretty solid both of us, and we just had some good opportunities that we didn't take advantage of.   But all in all, it was pretty decent.   
   
 Q.   It's a new pairing, you clearly gelled fairly quickly.   
ANDERS HANSEN:   Obviously we only played nine holes before yesterday.   For ThorbjÃ¸rn having to come here, it was a pretty big deal and I think he's done tremendously.   He played very well today and he's very‑‑ his mind, he was very calm out there.   Chipped in at the start, like, whoa, here we go.   It was great.   He did very well today.   
   
 Q.   Your own form, what about your own game today?   
ANDERS HANSEN:   It was pretty good.   I didn't drive the ball as good.   I'm struggling a bit with my driver.   I can't quite find the setting that I want.   I hit some pretty good iron shots out there, so all in all pretty good.   
   
 Q.   We joked a little bit about yesterday, Denmark winning the European football championships with virtually no preparation.   It's sometimes the way it goes, isn't it, you're a bit more relaxed coming into these things?  
ANDERS HANSEN:   We are both pretty relaxed about it.   We want to do as well as we possibly can, and we want to get the most out of it.   
   
 Q.   How do you think your games combine for foursomes?   Are you similar in sort of style?  
ANDERS HANSEN:   I think we'll be okay.   I think we are going to be okay.   We'll see tomorrow.   Obviously we've never played foursomes before, so it's going to be a different experience.   We are just going to have to focus and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   A good start for you.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Made a few more putts on the front nine but played really solid.   It's a good score.   
   
 Q.   Anders seemed to start well and you weighed in with a couple yourself?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Anders is a great player and very steady.   
   
 Q.   In this wind it's not easy, is it?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It's not easy after three or four holes, it was really windy and there was some tough holes and long par 5s, I think it's 680 yards or something.   So there's a few tough holes.   
   
 Q.   Tell me your personal highlight out there.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I hit a great shot on the par3.   I think it's 14, great 7‑iron to three feet.   
   
 Q.   And that's the kind of shot that makes you feel involved?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I had a really good stretch there with three birdies in a row.   That helps.   
   
 Q.   Let's move on to the tale of you even being here.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It's some story, yeah.   Well, Thomas, he called me Friday evening, I was in Japan, and he said he couldn't play, he was feeling terrible for a week.   I flew to Hong Kong on Saturday and then made my Visa on Monday.   I had three for our days in Hong Kong just to enjoy myself, and go to the embassy and try to get my Visa sorted.   All worked out good and got a practise round yesterday.   
   
 Q.   Would you have been en route to South Africa?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I would have been home, so it's nice.   
   
 Q.   Still came as a surprise?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was a big surprise.   I knew that Thomas wasn't feeling well but I thought he would still make it, so it was a big surprise.   
Thomas has played fantastic this season, three wins this season, and he wants to play, so I just have to step in for him and do my best.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on the Opening Ceremony?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I didn't know there was a ceremony like that.   I thought it was just like a normal tournament.   But it was a surprise and really nice, a good show.   Special.   
   
 Q.   Was it special just to be involved?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, just try to do our best, and it's really nice just to be here.
