ANDERS HANSEN:   I was teeing off at 7:24.  Her water was broken and she was going to go in the hospital, so I thought, right, I'm going to head home.  Tried to get on a jet, they couldn't get me one in time, so I got the 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock Germany time     jumped in a cab, was home within an hour and I got home just before 9:00, but he was born at 4:34.  It's Luke James.  It's fantastic, a nice couple of days at home, the weekend and mom and baby are well.
Q.  How do you feel coming in here?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, I've hit it lovely.  I've hit it really, really nice.  I hit it    I just need to roll a few putts.
Q.  Does the short stick seem to be the problem?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, the short stick has been misbehaving.  Hopefully we'll get the right one this week.  I've never had a good record around this place     don't know why, there shouldn't be any reason for it, because I love the golf course.  Looking forward to a big week.
Q.  This is your time of year?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, this is the right time of year.
