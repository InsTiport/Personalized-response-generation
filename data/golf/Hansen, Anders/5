Q.   Thoughts on the day? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Got off to a not great start but it turned out quite good.   My wedge game was good. 

Q.   Beautiful approach at the last, and tapped that in for birdie. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   It was great.   Both 17 and 18 I had two tap‑ins for birdies.   That was great.   I had perfect yardages, so just ended up very, very good.

Q.   Sums up the course; seems sublime. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   The course is awesome.   It's in such good shape.   It's even better than it normally is.   It's always good here but this year it's fantastic.

Q.   Players say how much they love coming to this part of the world; very much so for you, as well? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, it's a great start.   We have three events and the weather is normally pretty good and the courses are great, so there's nothing to complain about. 

Q.   Put this round into context.   Been playing all right but not quite getting the scores. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I've been playing sort of right there and thereabouts.   Today things just seemed to be coming together.   I hit a few loose ones out there, which you normally do but this time I got away with it and that's the difference.

Q.   Is that just the nature of this time of year, as well, work‑in‑progress?
ANDERS HANSEN:   It always is.   Golf is a work‑in‑progress.   You're always trying to get better at what you're doing.   This time of the year, had three months off, so a bit rusty to start with.   But it's been a decent start.   I made the first three cuts, so pretty happy with that.

Q.   That's a long time off. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Hung out with the kids and just at home.   I really enjoyed it.

Q.   You feel the benefit? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   It's always nice to play well and it's been a great start, and coming out here, good weather and instead of being home, it's really, really cold there.
