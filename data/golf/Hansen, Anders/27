   ANDERS HANSEN: Obviously I'm a little disappointed. I gave myself a chance after leading and got myself out of it early but brought myself back into it. Thought I played nicely. But Alvaro played great and in these conditions to shoot the score that he did, it's tough out there. 
 But I thought I did what I could. I had a couple chances but just not quite there. 

 Q. You knew what you had to do at the last, as well?
 ANDERS HANSEN: I knew what I had to do. So my caddie said, just back off and I said no, no, we have to try and make this. But not good enough. 

 Q. So you have to keep that positive approach throughout, haven't you; you can't be conservative in windy conditions. 
 ANDERS HANSEN: It's a tough day. You know, it's very tough out there, and it's very windy and when you get close, you have to take your chances, and I didn't.

 Q. Overall, have to be very positive when you fly away from here?
 ANDERS HANSEN: Finishing second is never bad, is it. If you're disappointed finishing second, you shouldn't be here. There are so many good players here, so it's just one of those things.
