Q.   How was your round today? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Well, steady.   I played steady today and didn't make many mistakes and just kept the ball in play and gave myself some opportunities, and so it was pretty steady.

Q.   So one off the lead at the moment, held by Francesco Molinari; do you feel you're very much in the frame going into tomorrow? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   Yeah, it's a new day tomorrow.   We'll see what's going to happen.   Francesco is obviously playing very, very good golf at the moment.   I had a great finish last week, so it's going to be fun to play with him. 

Q.   How is your own game?
ANDERS HANSEN:   My long game has improved and giving myself lots of opportunities.   The more opportunities you give yourself, the better chance you have to make the putts.   If you give yourself one opportunity, it's not going to happen, but if you give yourself lots of opportunities, it's going to happen sooner or later. 
That's been the key last week and this week, and been striking the ball pretty solid and giving myself a lot of opportunities, and sooner or later, some putts will drop. 

Q.   It's a privy heavily congested leaderboard, and I guess at the moment pretty difficult for us to pick a winner. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   It's very, very difficult.   The scores are so low.   It's very difficult to keep making putts and to keep making birdies.   It's very, very‑‑ it's tough. 

Q.   How different from last week to this week?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Completely different game.   Last week was a completely different golf course.   You come here and then all of a sudden you're just going to have to make a lot of birdies.
