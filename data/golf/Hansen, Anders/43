ANDERS HANSEN:  I've got a long way to go.  I know I've got to work on it, just trying to work on it during the PGA experience.  But it's a good experience, people out here are good, kind of rooting you on.  It's nice to be in the mix, standing up there putting this morning was kind of cool.  Dean Wilson actually birdied the last hole, I think, to get in it, which was kind of fun to see him grind it out there.
Q.  Talk a little bit about your round today, a few birdies early.
ANDERS HANSEN:  Yeah, I had a couple birdies early and got it going pretty good on the front nine, but unfortunately I missed a couple of fairways on the back nine and gave up a couple shots and couldn't get my normal birdies.
Q.  Did you find the course change at all throughout the course of the day?
ANDERS HANSEN:  It was playing very long this morning, very long.  We knew it was going to play hole.  It's been raining all night.
