 Q.  So much to reflect on, but you congratulated the winner here, and you've been a winner yourself on two occasions, two of them the Flagship Event; quite some career.  
ANDERS HANSEN: It's been a great ride, I've really enjoyed it.  It's almost a shame it's over but I enjoyed the time I was here and now it's time to do other things.
