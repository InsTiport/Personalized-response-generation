  Q. Round of 17 including the back nine at 1-under, pleased with your day?   
 ANDERS HANSEN: I'm pleased. I set myself out to try to play a good, solid round and I did that. I didn't quite make the putts I was hoping I was going to make -- I rolled one in but that was nice. Good start to the round. I stayed in touch for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Your impressions of Brendan Steele?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: I got a putting lesson today. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that. I was very impressed. He was playing nice, but his putting is definitely impressive.   
  
  Q. Tomorrow the game plan will be?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: I think we are just going to sit down and talk about it and look at it, and I think I'm going to try and stay positive and try to play solid, and then once come the back nine, probably make see the position and make a decision from there.  
  
  Q. Six first-time winners in a row in majors, you could be the seventh; fancy that?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: I would fancy that. That would be nice, wouldn't it.   
 You know, I have to -- if I can play solid again tomorrow like I did today, maybe hit it closer -- the ball is travelling so far here. You couldn't believe how far the ball is travelling, but then you can make some putts, and we are going to have a chance.
