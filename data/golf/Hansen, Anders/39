   GORDON SIMPSON:  Here you are at Wentworth and here you are winning again.  Clearly the love affair continues. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  Yeah, I wouldn't say winning. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  A victory. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  I got by the first round which was nice. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  No trophy yet. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  No trophy yet.  It was nice. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Beating The Open Champion was a nice thing. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  Yeah, obviously when I saw him, the only thing I had going for me was him not liking this golf course. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  And you liking it presumably. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  Yeah, I like it.  I think it's a pretty good golf course. 
 But, you know, the thing with Padraig, he's just so -- he just keeps going.  You just never know and he's going to come up with and that's why he's The Open Champion, and that's why he's a tough guy to play against.  And here I just have to try and stay on top and keep pushing him, at least try to make him win the hole and not just give it to him.  Well, I could give him a few, but he gave me a few.  It wasn't pretty in the morning but played a bit better on the second nine and things were picking up. 

 Q.  What was the key? 
ANDERS HANSEN:  I think I kept the ball in play, and I think I just kept pushing him and I could see that he was trying to push.  He just came -- he made a few mistakes trying to push hard, and I think that's part of match play, isn't it. 

 Q.  
ANDERS HANSEN:  Well, I think it would be fun to play him and tomorrow is a new day and I'm going to have to play a bit better than did I today.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens. 

 Q.  Do you like match play? 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  Do I like match play?  It's a different format.  I think it plays with your mind out there, that's what it does. 

 Q.  In what way? 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  It's sort of like certain shot, you're thinking, well how should I play this shot all of a sudden because you're so used to playing stroke play, so you have that normal mental approach to it and then all of a sudden you're thinking, okay, if he's hitting a good shot, you're thinking, well, I'm going to have to get it close and there's a few things there.  But match play, it's nice to get to play match play. 

 Q.  Inaudible. 
ANDERS HANSEN:  Obviously it's different from playing stroke play but I'm trying to keep as close to it as I can, play many I stroke play and just playing my own game and see what happens.  Because sometimes as you saw Padraig doing today, pushing too hard and then you make mistakes. 

 Q.  What was your form like recently? 
ANDERS HANSEN:  The last two tournaments in America, I missed the cut.  But, you know, that's golf.  It goes up-and-down.  I've had a pretty solid summer and didn't have a very good start to the year, good summer.  And we'll see the fall here, we've got a couple championships before going home.  I think in previous years, it's been quite different.  I've played terrible all summer but played good in the spring and the fall.  This year it's been different.  That's why I quit trying to understand this game.  It's I am possible.  (Laughter). 

 Q.  Did winning at Wentworth help you confidence? 
ANDERS HANSEN:  Well, it was boosted when I won it, but it's gone downhill the last two weeks but we'll see.  I feel pretty comfortable on this golf course. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  You have to come to Wentworth to get your confidence back. 
 ANDERS HANSEN:  Maybe I should get a membership here and play a bit more. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Well played, Anders.  Let's see how you get on tomorrow.
