Q.   Comment on today's play?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Well, I think I didn't quite play as well as I did the first two days.   The putter was pretty cold.   So it's kind of a bad combination.   So I guess should be pretty happy with it. 

Q.   And even on the last there, there was one you felt you should make?
ANDERS HANSEN:   That one, it didn't even cross my mind.   Didn't even cross my mind that I was going to miss that.   I don't know.   The last bit of concentration. 

Q.   You haven't lost any ground. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   A little bit.   But you know, still got a chance tomorrow.   Just going to have to see if I can play a little better tomorrow and try and make a few more putts and got to make a few birdies.

Q.   Are the greens, the conditions any trickier?
ANDERS HANSEN:   The first two days we played in very hard wind in my draw and today the wind was not as strong and it was a little bit different than it was.   Just a couple of times, I got a bit confused out there.   It was like the wind is coming from a different direction, not as hard and you're not‑‑ your yardage is a bit different than the first to days. 

Q.   But you're smiling?
ANDERS HANSEN:   Things happen, you know, just see what happens tomorrow.
