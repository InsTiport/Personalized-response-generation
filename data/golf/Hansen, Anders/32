  Q. Fourth time you've played in this championship. You've lost in the first round three times before, but the good news is they were all major champions. You've got a bad draw. Today you've taken out a major champion. How does that feel?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: It feels great. I didn't actually know I played a major champions in the other ones. I never really thought about it, but I guess you're right. I knew it was going to be tough today.  
  
  Q. What gave you the edge today?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: To start with, we kept giving each other holes. It was just not pretty.   
 Then after 9, he got to 2-up. I back to even. I thought let's see. At least I thought if he's going to win this, at least make him win it, just don't give it to him.  
  
  Q. I hear you guys talking about when I get momentum, it's so important in Match Play.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: Of course it is. It makes you believe that this is -- still with two down, it's never nice. It's always going to be a uphill battle.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you are going to go a long way this time?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: You take one day at a time and we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. I wish you luck.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: Thanks, Todd.
