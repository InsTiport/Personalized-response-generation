   ANDERS HANSEN: It was a nice start to the day. I played nicely, hit some good shots, holed a few putts and all in all five under is pretty good. 
 The wind is strong, one to two clubs and you have to get your trajectory right. The greens are firm so you leave yourself a lot of 15 footers and hit the odd one close and it is nice when you can take advantage of it.

 Q. You have kept the form going from Joburg?
 ANDERS HANSEN: The weekend at Joburg I played really good golf. Last week I felt I played quite nicely so I am very pleased with that start to the year. I took five weeks off so to come back the way I have has been great. It is nice to take some time off now and again. 
 Last year I worked really hard but things didn't quite go right. I will work hard again this year but I think what has been showing is I am really good cleaning up with the putter, really good from five feet in and making a few ten footers and that makes a big difference.

 Q. The confidence must be sky high?
 ANDERS HANSEN: I am comfortable with the game, comfortable with the golf swing and all in all pretty happy.
