   ANDERS HANSEN: It's been two good days and I'm really happy with the position I'm in. The front nine yesterday was not great, but the back nine, I played solid, and today, I played solid. I had a bit of a spell where I lost a bit of concentration, but I managed to get it back. I hung in there. So, it's all right.  
  
  Q. Is it about finding a rhythm, as it so often is?   
 ANDERS HANSEN: Of course it is. Once you find the rhythm, it's much easier, and if you lose the rhythm and having to find it again, that's always where the troubles starts. And I lost a bit of rhythm, a bit unfortunate but that's how the golf is.  
  
  Q. I presume the course is not quite there for the taking, but more benign than the opening day?   
 ANDERS HANSEN: Obviously the weather was better today. The greens are firm and it's very difficult to hit the ball close. Long putts, it's just not easy to make long putts. It's difficult.   
  
  Q. I know this game is always a work-in-progress, but it seems like you're searching for something and you're not entirely happy with things overall at the moment.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: I'm happy. Could be better, of course. You can't really complain when you're in there and when you're right there, so it's okay.  
  
  Q. Fine position on that board?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: I'm pretty happy. I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. And you're in the mood to be competitive and keep on I take it?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: Always am.
