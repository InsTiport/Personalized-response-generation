Q.   What are your thoughts on a nice, low round to start? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I was happy with the way I played more than anything.   I hit the ball better than I have for awhile.   I was working hard Tuesday with Titleist to sort of sort that one out.   Seems to have gone well. 

Q.   Always a work‑in‑progress, but you actually have been playing pretty well by and large, haven't you?
ANDERS HANSEN:   It's been okay.   It's been‑‑ yeah, it's been okay.   There's been some really good weeks and there's been after wage weeks, but that's golf.   It's up‑and‑down, up‑and‑down.   The downs just makes you enjoy the good rounds even better, even more.

Q.   Not the sexiest word, but we are all striving for consistency, I guess. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   But the more you strive for that; you just have to try and go out and do your best.   As you talk about, it's a work in progress try to keep getting better. 
I came here having a few troubles with the driving, but it seems to have been a lot better today than it has been for a while.

Q.   What do you make of Fota Island?
ANDERS HANSEN:   It's great so far.   The weather has been awesome.   It seems like we are not playing in Ireland. 

Q.   You've played here in all sorts of rubbishy weather in the past.   This is hotter than the World Cup. 
ANDERS HANSEN:   This is just divine conditions.   You can't really ask for any better than this.   There's a little breeze out there to cool it down, so it's perfect.

Q.   A course that meets your eye? 
ANDERS HANSEN:   I think there's a bit too many cut shots off the tee.   Feels like Monty made this one (laughter).
