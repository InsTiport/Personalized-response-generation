  Q. Your reflections on a fine round of golf?  
 ANDERS HANSEN: It wasn't pretty out there. I think none of us played that great but it's very difficult. It's gusty and blowing a lot and it's blowing really hard. It's difficult, yeah, and the greens are so firm. It's not easy, but I'm very happy with the score.   
  
  Q. The reason I say it is a fine round of golf is in the context of everybody twirling in those elements, you kept it going tremendously well.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: Yeah, thanks, I did. I was very happy. I was chipping the ball well, so that was good to keep the score going.  
  
  Q. You play with a smile on your face most of the time, but today it looked like you really enjoyed it at times.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: It was always going to be a tough day playing with Tiger, you always know it's going to be -- he's a great guy, he's a super guy. It's not his fault the crowd is going crazy out there and it's not his fault that there's so much movement around and it's just a bit difficult. We had a chat about it. He knows what's going on. But he's a great guy and I really enjoyed to.  
  
  Q. But your focus is that much more different and you can become aggravated if you don't just take it on the chin.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: You have to take it on the chin. It's one of those things, you have to get on with it and do your job. It turned out well. I'm really happy with the scores.   
  
  Q. That goes without saying but this is wide open.   
 ANDERS HANSEN: It is. There's so many guys -- I just had a brief look on the leaderboard, and obviously in blustery conditions, the morning guys had a great day.   
 So, there you go, you know what it's going to be like on this golf courser and time we play in Dubai, and also The Race to Dubai, it's so difficult in the afternoon. That's just the way it is.
