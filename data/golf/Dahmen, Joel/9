 Q.  Okay.  Joel, a 67 today.  You're third round under 70 this week.  Just describe your experience and what's it like to finish so well.  
JOEL DAHMEN: Yeah, it was good.  My first time in this position.  I was pretty nervous today all the way around and really settled down.  Played with Dustin Johnson added to something like that.  I never seen so many people on the 2nd and 3rd holes.  It was really cool out there.   
 Q.  You're here because you're a Web.com Tour graduate from last year.  What does a finish like this do for you moving forward this season?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Just a lot of confidence.  I haven't played well this year, haven't had a lot of starts.  So, yeah going forward with the summer picking up and being busy, I'm just excited to play again.   
 Q.  We spoke to Nick Taylor, your former college roommate.  He said you guys have been playing practice rounds together.  How big has his help been for you this year?  
JOEL DAHMEN: A ton.  Moreso off the course as well, where to stay and eat, just kind of where everything is.  Everything is new.  And so just kind of have him tell me where to go and what to do has been a huge help for me.   
 Q.  Very cool to see you do so well this week and good luck the rest of the season.  
JOEL DAHMEN: Thank you so much.
