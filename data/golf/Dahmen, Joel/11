 Q.   Nice start, four birdies, no bogeys.   You had a really good look at 18.   What a great day for you.   
JOEL DAHMEN:   It was incredible.   It was my first PGA TOUR event, my first round.   I was shaking in my boots on that first tee, and I hit it miles right, actually had to pitch out, and I hit a 6‑iron to like three feet, settled down a little bit, but I really struggled with ball‑striking on the front and then actually hit it pretty well on the back.  
   
 Q.   Since you play on PGA TOUR Canada, how often do you get to play here?  
JOEL DAHMEN:   No, this is my first trip to Montreal.   We never play out this way.   Yeah, so it's actually set up very similar to a PGA TOUR Canada golf course.   There's not a ton of rough out here and the greens aren't too quick yet.   We had some rain yesterday, so things are pretty soft and definitely slower today.  
   
 Q.   What's life like on PGA TOUR Canada?  
JOEL DAHMEN:   It's not glamorous.   This is pretty glamorous out here.   No, we're split in two or three to hotels, we're driving eight, nine hours, eating a lot of McDonald's, a lot of Subway out there to pinch pennies.   So it's definitely not glamorous, but it's the proper steps you have to go through to someday be out here.   
   
 Q.   So your thoughts now as you go into the week, this is a great start, and I know you want to get down to the States and play full‑time but you've got to take it round by round, don't you?  
JOEL DAHMEN:   Absolutely.   I'm not going to get too far ahead of myself.   I know I played a good round today, but having won twice this summer already, I've known‑‑ and I've actually had the first‑round lead on those.   I know there's a ton of golf left.   I'm happy how I played, but there is so much golf left.
