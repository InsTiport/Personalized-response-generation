 Q.  How ecstatic are you guys that you don't have to wake up tomorrow at the crack of dawn and get back out here after a long day today.  
BRANDON HARKINS: Very, very.  It just means more time at Harrod's tonight.  The 4:00 a.m. wake-up was enough this morning.  Long day today, and sleeping in is going to be great tomorrow.   
 Q.  How much golf have you guys played together?  Pretty formidable team, or is this kind of a fresh partnership?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Every day at home.   
BRANDON HARKINS: Every day, every practice rounds.  We've been best friends for seven, eight years now.  We met in Canada on the Mackenzie TOUR, live in Scottsdale, bought our houses about the same time.   
JOEL DAHMEN: Our wives are the best of friends.  It's a pretty good deal.   
 Q.  Do you get tired of each other?  
BRANDON HARKINS: No, we kind of -- we don't really.  When we're at home, we practice and then it's like, well, whose house are we going to for dinner, which wife is cooking.  It's the same place.  I stayed at his place for three weeks when he was remodeling, they lived at mine for a month maybe.  So we were rooming together almost every week, so it's pretty doable.   
 Q.  I'm sure there's a good reason for this, but why didn't you guys play together last year?  
BRANDON HARKINS: You can talk to my friend about that one.  I played with Lanto Griffin.  At the time he and I decided to play together, Joel, we weren't certain if Joel was going to be here or not.   
JOEL DAHMEN: I wasn't very good at golf when they got their TOUR cards.   
BRANDON HARKINS: So Lanto and I decided to play together pretty early on and just kind of stuck with it.   
 Q.  If you guys take golf out of the equation, what activity or sport or whatever would you make the best team at?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Wow.   
BRANDON HARKINS: Corn hole.   
JOEL DAHMEN: We throw bags.   
BRANDON HARKINS: We're pretty good at that.   
JOEL DAHMEN: We like to sit on the couch and watch sports together.  We're very good at that.  We're really good at that.   
BRANDON HARKINS: Teaming up against our wives to get our way.  We do good at that.   
JOEL DAHMEN: You know what we team up a lot in is doing the dishes.   
BRANDON HARKINS: Yeah, our wives cook, we do dishes.   
JOEL DAHMEN: On a nightly basis.   
BRANDON HARKINS: Really good at drinking beer together.   
JOEL DAHMEN: Yeah, we like to have a beer or two together, and that's about it.   
 Q.  So this friendship extends to dress code and mustaches, too?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Yeah, we mainly are doing the mustaches because our wives love it.  They asked for it actually.   
BRANDON HARKINS: I've been growing mine for about five weeks, not necessarily in preparation for this, and he came on strong with his.  He came on late.   
JOEL DAHMEN: We may just keep them.  We'll see.   
BRANDON HARKINS: If we keep playing well, they're definitely going to be around.   
 Q.  Will you be dressing together, too?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Well, this is the only thing we had.  We may have a Navy blue in there, but I think the rest of the week we're just going to do whatever we've got, which wouldn't be totally uncommon.   
 Q.  How tough was the delay, seven hours plus?  
JOEL DAHMEN: The delay?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
BRANDON HARKINS: We were rolling, too, so it wasn't great for us.  If you're playing well and you're going, you just want to keep going, obviously, but did a good job of hanging around.  We actually went to my physio's.  He's staying at a place down the road.  We went there and hung out.  We had lunch and watched TV for a bit, so it was nice to get away from the golf course for a little bit of it.   
JOEL DAHMEN: I think the hardest part was we totally warmed up and were ready to go out and then they blew the horn again.  So we were ready to go back out on the golf course around 1:00 and then that suspension kind of really set us back because --   
BRANDON HARKINS: Yeah, to get ready for a third time is hard.  You can do two, but rarely do you do three.  I think it took a couple holes to get going but made a couple coming in, which kind of helped out.   
 Q.  So the challenge, you'll have a late start tomorrow, so that means you're going to have to play early on Saturday.  You get to sleep in tomorrow, but --  
BRANDON HARKINS: Yeah, I think they just said 5:00 or 5:30 roughly so that's going to be tough because we'll play -- what, it's 7:30 now, so we'll play nine holes alternate-shot, which is actually better than I thought it would be.  But part of waking up and part of the weather is just part of being golfers, and you deal with it.
