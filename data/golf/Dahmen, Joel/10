 Q.  Par with a birdie at 7, but I always joke that 8 might be the longest 410 yard hole in the history of golf?  
JOEL DAHMEN: It's only 399 and we were in between 4- and 5-iron in the fairway.  Actually hit a pretty good shot.  Got up to like 40, 50 feet.  But not a very good lag putt.  But, yeah, to make the 15-footer on 18 for par was huge.   
 Q.  Tell me about that.  Walk me through it.  It was cold and raw out there and we're waiting for a rules official for 15 minutes maybe?  
JOEL DAHMEN: Yeah, 10 minutes or so.  It was tough.  I just was really happy to make that last putt, that's for sure.   
 Q.  How about the golf course?  This golf course, we're saying it's the hardest of the rotation, but when it's ugly, it gets -- might be the easiest.  
JOEL DAHMEN: That's what we were kind of talking about.  We might have got a break.  We might have caught a break today.  Being up here in the trees, but it's still tough.  But with this weather, I don't know if they're going to play much longer, to be honest.   
 Q.  How about this, 3 of 28 professionals have hit the 9th green in two at Pebble Beach today.  
JOEL DAHMEN: Wow.  That's amazing.  I'm glad I'm out there tomorrow.
