Q.   Well, your first experience in the PGA Championship, you finished with four straight pars. 
LEE RHIND:   Yeah, gladly take those.   I had a blast.   It was a great experience.   I learned a lot about just what goes on, what goes into these events, and you know, have fun, but obviously score wasn't what I wanted.   Hopefully I'll be back again and hopefully do a little better next time.
It was a blast no matter what.   It was great to spend the last few days with all my family, play some golf.   So it's a truly wonderful experience.

Q.   Had to be pretty miserable when it was pouring out there. 
LEE RHIND:   Just one of those things, everyone had to endure it.   I'm not going to complain too much. 

Q.   Does this enhance your desire to get back to another PGA and go through this experience again? 
LEE RHIND:   Oh, definitely.   Definitely.   As soon as I go back home, I'm going to start upping my practice and maybe my fitness regime just a little bit.   Yeah, I definitely want to come back.   In the qualifier for next year, so very much already looking forward to June, so I've got a lot of stuff to do, but I'll be excited to have the opportunity to come back to one of these events again.
