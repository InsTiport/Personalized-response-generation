 Q.   Talk about your day.   
MARK MCNULTY:   It was a tough day, you got to grind it out.   It was obviously a good time to get those birdies, because it wasn't going to get any easier and things were tough.   And it just got me back into the game.   
And obviously it's always unfortunate to 3‑putt the last hole, but that's golf and I'm very happy with the round.   
   
 Q.   Any thoughts about changing anything going into tomorrow?   
MARK MCNULTY:   Nothing, really.   Hopefully the wind is going to disappear tomorrow.   I think there's not going to be much wind tomorrow, maybe 10, 15, but it will feel like nothing compared to today.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions of the course.   Is it comparable with the courses that you've played?  
MARK MCNULTY:   The course is, I think, it's lovely.   I enjoy it.   It's tough to ‑‑ the green complexes are so tough, judging by the long round today, 5 hours, 45 minutes, that tells it all.   It's just one of those things.   
But it's great for this area and it will get a lot of benefits from the tournament.
