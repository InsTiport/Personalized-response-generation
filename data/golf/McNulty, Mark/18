Q.
A couple thoughts on your round today.
MARK McNULTY:  Obviously a little pissed off because I three putted from ten feet on the last hole.  When you're looking to make the putt and you three putt it, you know, that's golf.  It happens.  Shit happens.  We don't try and do it.

You know, back at the beginning of the day if you had said 4 under, I'd be delighted.  I'm in a reasonable position.
Q.  You're right there.
MARK McNULTY:  With two days to go.  I'd like to continue like this, playing well.
Q.  Were there any heroics out there, any long putts you made?
MARK McNULTY:  No, not really.  I really just played very steady today.  I think I kept the ball in the fairway and on the green, and I putted nicely, too.  All in all, I was very happy with the day.
Q.  Anything different about the course?  Has it changed at all from yesterday?
MARK McNULTY:  It's drying out a little but not significantly enough to warrant any significant major attention seeking at the moment, but I'm sure it'll be dry tomorrow and by Sunday it'll be even dryer.
