 Q. You had a great round this morning. 
 MARK MCNULTY: It was a good scoring round. I've been battling with my swing and yesterday was no exception. Even today I missed quite a few fairways and caught quite a few good breaks with my lies and on the greens as well. 
 But overall I put the pencil nicely on the golf card, which is, by the end of the day, that's the important thing. So I got to go to the range after lunch again and hopefully find something for the next two days. 
 Because as Lee Trevino said a long time ago, dogs that chase cars and pros that putt for pars don't last long. And it's just the way the swing is at the moment. 

 Q. But you had back-to-back birdies on the front. 
 MARK MCNULTY: Yeah, I did. I played the back nine first today and I made some good saving pars and then it sort of turned around a little bit and it was nice to finish with those couple of pars on 6 and 7 there. 
 And I made a great up-and-down at 8. And I had a chance at a birdie on the ninth hole. But I will have a nice lunch now, that's the most important thing.
