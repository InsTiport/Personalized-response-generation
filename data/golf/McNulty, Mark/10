  Q. Tell us a little bit about your round.   
 MARK MCNULTY: A little better. I guess the work paid off. I'm still not quite exactly where I would like to be, but certainly there's a lot more light at the end of the tunnel and believe it or in the today my putter let me down a little bit where the first two days it was magical. But thank God it was magical.   
 So, I'm happy. I suppose if after the first nine holes the first day you said I was going to be 1-over at this stage of the game I would be delighted. So hopefully tomorrow will produce some better results than today and we'll see. But all in all I'm very happy.  
  
  Q. How does it feel to be in the hunt?  
 MARK MCNULTY: Oh, nice. I wouldn't like to say I'm in the hunt. I've got a lot of work to still do. But the course is there to be played and if you can keep it in the straight and narrow then you're going to get the dividends.
