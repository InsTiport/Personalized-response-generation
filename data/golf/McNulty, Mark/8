  Q. Heck of a run of it this afternoon?  
 MARK McNULTY: As I said, I always felt I was one shot below, and it turned out I was, one short. I gave it all I had, and just one bad shot. That's what happens. Bad swing, not a particularly good swing.   
  
  Q. That putt in regulation play on 18 --  
 MARK McNULTY: And the one on 17 was even much shorter. You know, you hit good putts that don't go in sometimes. That's the way it is.   
 All in all, obviously I'm happy with the performance this week and going to take a lot of confidence into next week's tournament.  
  
  Q. It was a brave putt in the first playoff hole after Loren had already made a birdie.   
 MARK McNULTY: Obviously it's always nice to have a putt to win, but it wasn't to be. I never had a putt to win. I had a couple of putts to win in regulation play but not in the playoff.   
 And the shot, it got away from me. I didn't complete my swing and got ahead of it.   
  
  Q. No options down there?  
 MARK McNULTY: No, that's it. I was stone dead, and had to take a drop.   
  
  Q. Overall, some up your week here at Sunningdale.   
 MARK McNULTY: It's been great. Obviously when you don't win, and you think you have a chance towards the end -- obviously all of my bonuses, by playing well today, to get myself into position, I was delighted. But very happy with the performance, very happy with the performance.  
  
  Q. Enjoying playing back at Sunningdale?  
 MARK McNULTY: Yes, staying at home, which is great and I suppose I live the closest, so it's been nice.
