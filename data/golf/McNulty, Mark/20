Q.  How do you feel the course is playing so far today?
MARK McNULTY:  Well, it's not just today, it's been every day.  It's obviously in great shape.  I haven't heard anybody, anybody mention one blade of grass that's out of place.  So it's in fantastic condition and it's playing fair.  The fairways are wide enough and if you hit it in the rough you deserve to take the penalty.  And even the rough is fair.  They have done a great job with it already.  And we're looking forward to a fine tournament.
Q.  Do you think the weather is going to make a difference?
MARK McNULTY:  Well, I'm not too sure what the final weather forecast is going to be for the remainder of the week.  But I hear it's going to be a rough one.

And let's hope we have had the worst part of it, it's gone and it's behind us.  And the next few days are going to be good.
