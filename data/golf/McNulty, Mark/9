  Q. Where do you think you stand?   
 MARK McNULTY: I certainly think it's one shot. That's my honest opinion. But who knows. Obviously at the moment, I'll count my blessings if I get to a playoff.   
  
  Q. It was a stormy finish, those putts, by and large, you made good strokes on them.   
 MARK McNULTY: I really thought I hit good putts, both of them. The last one I thought was going to go in and the last one slowed down and seemed to start turning. Why, I don't know.   
  
  Q. The way you got it going, was it like the old days?   
 MARK McNULTY: You know, I've been playing, ever since my win in Des Moines, I've been playing a lot better. A couple of small adjustments in the swing have helped and the putter is always there, and it's good. It helps the game a lot.  
 I think my game is pretty solid at the moment. As I said, though, one shot.   
  
  Q. You certainly had some support on the 18th, and obviously you originate from Zimbabwe and you fly the Irish flag now, I don't know why that entirely is.   
 MARK McNULTY: I had a lot of Zimbabwe friends and family, but basically the history is all of my ancestors came from Ireland.   
 Now I got me a little Irish coin.  
  
  Q. Is that a lucky one, is it?   
 MARK McNULTY: It is, yeah.   
  
  Q. What do you do now in this situation where you're waiting for a possible playoff?  
 MARK McNULTY: I guess I'll go and spend a few minutes with the family out there. Just watch the leaderboard.
