Q.   Talk about your round today. 
MARK McNULTY:   I played really good golf today and I broke a record‑‑ I don't want to say that I could have finished off with some really good putts.   I missed a bunch of putts today.   And for me to say that, that's, the people who know me, know I normally putt well. 
I've been struggling a little bit lately whether it's head movement or whatever. 
But, no, I'm very satisfied about the way I played and let's hope can I do the same tomorrow and maybe hole the putts.

Q.   Is there any ‑‑ what was the big difference between today's round and the first two?
MARK McNULTY:   I think yesterday I got a little unsettled playing 5, 6, 8, and 9, trying to make the cut.   I wasn't holing putts again and I just made some stupid mistakes.   3‑putted the ninth hole to shoot 3‑over yesterday. 
I definitely played great golf today from tee to green.   I played nearly as well the first day and yesterday not quite as good.   So my tee to green game's great, I just need to brush up on the putting.
