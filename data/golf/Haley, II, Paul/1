  PAUL HALEY, II:   Had a nice chip-in on 14 that kind of got me going.   I kind of settled down there tee to green.   Kind of simple.   Not a lot of mistakes.  
   
 Q.   Not a lot of ups and downs, three birdies, one bogey.   Talk about the conditions out there.  
PAUL HALEY, II:   Yeah, it's tough.   It's tough to keep the ball in the fairway.   It's starting to get a lot faster in the fairways and, you know, the greens are starting to firm up.   So it's pretty tough to hit the ball close, especially some of the longer holes, some of the crosswinds, north wind last two days.   That's made it a lot more difficult.  
   
 Q.   What's keeping you on top in the leaderboard?  
PAUL HALEY, II:   I think all the facets of my game have been pretty good so far the first two days.   I've hit a lot of fairways and greens.   When I haven't, I've been able to get up and down.   It's probably a combination of all the things.
