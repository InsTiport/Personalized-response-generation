 Q. Great round today, five birdies in six holes around the turn, great boost?
 ROBERT-JAN DERKSEN: Yeah, it was great, starting out it's never too easy I think. I birdied 11 and made a very good par on 13, that was important, and birdied most of the holes coming in. Difficult holes, but played them very well. Hit fairways and hit them very close, and I hit it to about a foot on the far side, 14, and I hit it about 5-foot on 15, four foot on 16, and 18, probably 15 feet or something. 
 Then the rest of the round, I picked up another few on my back nine. Didn't make any mistakes and played good, gave myself chances and made a few putts. 

 Q. Which of those birdies gave you the most satisfaction today?
 ROBERT-JAN DERKSEN: Actually the par on 13. But the one on 18 probably, that was nice. It's a difficult hole. The pin was very difficult. Hit a good drive, fairway and then a nice 7-iron exactly just a little bit on the safe side but I didn't make the putt so that was really nice.

 Q. You found the greens to your liking; should quicken up over the weekend?
 ROBERT-JAN DERKSEN: Yeah, I played on Tuesday and they were very soft and slow, but I think they are quicker than Tuesday, and I think as the week progresses they will quicken up, as well. And Sunday they will be lightning, like always.

 Q. So not been the best of years, but are you hoping the 64 can give you the kick-start you need for this tournament and the rest of the year?
 ROBERT-JAN DERKSEN: Yeah, struggled in the beginning with the grooves. Then I changed to new irons in Korea, and from Korea, I've been playing really good actually. At the start it was very difficult. I didn't have the confidence and now I do have the confidence. And if I can keep this up, yeah, I can definitely be in contention.
