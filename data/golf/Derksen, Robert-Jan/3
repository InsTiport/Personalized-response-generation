  ROBERT‑JAN DERKSEN:   The finish was good.   I was just a little, I don't know, frustrated with myself today.   I played good and I didn't make any mistakes, but I felt I left a few out there.   As I told you yesterday, I think 6‑under today was needed for myself, and actually we faced it yesterday evening during dinner to 7‑under maybe. 
But I was happy to finish well with a birdie.   It is tricky; the wind is tricky.   So we just have to wait and see what the other guys are doing so hopefully the best for me. 

Q.   Given how awkward 18 is, the birdie is all the more important, isn't it. 
ROBERT‑JAN DERKSEN:   I think it's one of the most trickiest holes we play on Tour.   It needs a perfect tee shot and an even better second, and the greens are very slopey, especially where the pin is today, it's an awkward spot more or less.   It's difficult to make a birdie but if you miss the green, it's actually difficult to make a par so even better for me to finish with a three and still have a chance. 

Q.   Your gut feeling though? 
ROBERT‑JAN DERKSEN:   Difficult to say.   Miguel is there, he's played well here.   But on the other hand, I've seen Monty win here with‑‑ I can't remember who it was, James Kingston twice, he doubled it twice.   It's golf so we'll have to wait.
