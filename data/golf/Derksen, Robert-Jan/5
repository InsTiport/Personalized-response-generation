Q.   One of those tantalising weeks, you know there's a good score possible, so you're always in it, aren't you?
ROBERT‑JAN DERKSEN:   Yeah, you always feel you've got a chance.   I didn't have the best of starts, I parred the first and the second, when I missed the greens but bogeyed the third, and you almost feel like you've definitely got to shoot under par, definitely, to do anything. 
Although it was a bit more difficult today with the wind I would say and the difficult pins, but after that, got it together and yeah, I made a lot of good birdies and shot 69. 
The major thing is I tried to get rid of the stupid mistakes but a lot less than the last two years.   China was the first one where I didn't make many.   This week was a good one where I didn't make too many.   If I get completely rid of them, might be in for a nice three weeks.

Q.   You're not tempted to go to Open Qualifying?
ROBERT‑JAN DERKSEN:   Not really.   I feel it's too much of a hassle almost.   6.30 first off tomorrow and Sunningdale, I feel at a disadvantage with all of the locals who have played it probably tens of times and I feel it's better to focus on these three weeks, Ireland and France, which I like and I feel I don't want to be too tired coming into France and Scotland.
