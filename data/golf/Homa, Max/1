  Q. Your group was all about what you were going to do today against the guy leading the group, J.T. Poston.  Big win for you, you close it out on 16.  Thoughts on the match?
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, I thought we both played pretty well to start.  I got it going on 10 and just played really solid coming in.  Had one mishap, but I felt like I kind of kept the pressure on best I could with the lead, so I was really happy with how I played.  Definitely the best I've played so far this week.
 Q. That helped Billy Horschel.  You'll be involved in a playoff with Billy.  The state of your game right now; how confident are you?
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, I feel more confident than I did the first day.  Obviously Billy is playing great, too, so should be a good little playoff, but we'll go do our best in about an hour.
