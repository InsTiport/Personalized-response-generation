  Q. What a match, a couple Golden Bears going up against each other.  You're really good friends with Collin Morikawa.  Was that difficult at all?
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, obviously it's tough playing against your friends, but I feel like you're more competitive against your friends than you are people you don't know, so I thought it was a good fight.  I gave him some early, he gave me some late.  I don't think it was either of our best days, but I felt like I fought really hard, and it's always fun playing against somebody like Collin, he's one of the best players I've ever played with, so it was cool to come out on top.
 Q. J.T. Poston has just won, beat Billy Horschel.  You control your own fate in that match on Friday.
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, I woke up this morning knowing if I won this morning I should have a good chance to control my fate tomorrow.  That's all you can ask for.  Looking forward to it.  I know J.T. really well, too, and his caddie, so it should be a fun match.  Hopefully we can get it done tomorrow.
