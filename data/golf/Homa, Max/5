  Q. A few takeaways from the week.  Something you can lean on moving forward.
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, I had played really, really well three weeks in a row prior and this was the first of those weeks where my swing didn't feel good at all, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and it's kind of, I guess maybe a sign of good things that I didn't panic and I trusted what I'm doing and kind of change the game plan up a little and then played some really good golf.  I threw away a lot of shots, especially today, but I hung in there and I'm just proud of not having it finally and kind of being in contention for a minute.
 Q. Were you able to determine what was it about your swing?
 MAX HOMA:   I don't know, yeah, my short irons were still great, that's kind of been what I've been doing well, but my tee balls just never felt good.  And I just kind of found a go-to shot, wore it out, trusted that I'm one of the better iron players and wore that out and putted better than I have the previous three weeks.  So it's fun to not feel perfect and put together four good days.
