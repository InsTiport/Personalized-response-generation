  Q. You birdied, on the par-3s, you birdied all of them.  First player to do that in a round.
 MAX HOMA:   Sick.
 Q. If you could just walk us through club and putt for each of the four par-3s.
 MAX HOMA:   5, hit a pitching wedge, spun it off the fringe, kind of pulled it but got away with it.  Had probably five, six, seven feet, a little left-to-right.  Made that one.
 7, hit a good one to like maybe eight, 10 feet up the hill.  Lob wedge.
 12, was 174, I hit a low 6-iron below the hole, probably 15 feet, 12-15 feet.  Made it.
 Then 17 had 196 and drew a 6-iron to like 20 feet, so it was a good four par-3s.
