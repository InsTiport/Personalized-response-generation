  Q. How would you assess your round today?
 MAX HOMA:   It was very solid, didn't do anything super special, but I didn't do anything below average, it felt like.  I hit a lot of good shots, left it in the right spots, made the putts I needed to.  So, yeah, it was just another kind of just solid, felt kind of -- tried to make it as easy as possible day.
 Q. What about your game suits this golf course?
 MAX HOMA:   I think you hit a lot of mid irons into the greens, I'm kind of that's my game, for the most part.  I don't know, it's a little, it's challenging tee to green and I typically drive it all right and hit my irons well, again, so I think, I don't know, I just think that the difficulty of it kind of fits, just because you have to leave it in the right spots and I feel like my misses with my irons are pretty tight right now, so I haven't really felt like I've missed it in a really bad spot yet.
 Q. When is the last time you played seven in a row?
 MAX HOMA:   The WEB.COM TOUR.  So it's a while.  Because it's now called the Korn Ferry TOUR.  I played a lot, but I hadn't, I wasn't playing very well, so I was missing a lot of those cuts, so this is definitely the most tired I've ever been, both legs and my brain, but it's kind of good at the same point because I feel like I'm kind of sleepwalking through some of these rounds and it's kind of a good thing, because I'm obviously playing really well and almost not thinking about anything, just playing.  But, yeah, this is, I'm beat.  I haven't felt like this in, since I was playing like, I don't know, a hundred holes when I was a little kid.
 Q. Has there been anything active that you've been proactively trying to do to balance that, knowing that you maybe don't have as much gas in the tank right now over these last two weeks?
 MAX HOMA:   Yeah, resting, taking it easy on my brain, not getting too up or too down.  I think that helps.  Just trying to conserve energy.  I haven't really been able to practice after the rounds, I haven't really practiced a whole lot before the tournament.  I kind of took all Monday off and I only came out for probably, I don't know, an hour or two on Tuesday.  Obviously I had to play the pro-am Wednesday.  But I have a great PT here, Edward Bolt, he's helped a lot, but just trying to conserve as much energy as I can, staying off my feet and not practicing too much.  But birdies always make it feel a little easier on the legs, so I'm going to keep trying to do that.
