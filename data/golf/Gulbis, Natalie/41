  Q.  I know that wasn't the way you wanted to end the round because you had it going for a while.   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah, played good.  Played really solid.  All the shots I missed all happened during one hole.   
  
  Q.  You put yourself in pretty good shape.   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah.  I think anything in the 60s would have been good on this golf course today.   
  
  Q.  We interviewed you last year here.  You like this golf course, you like it here?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  I love this golf course.  If you hit the ball well you can make a lot of birdies.  You miss shots and you're penalized.   
  
  Q.  What's the strategy for tomorrow?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Hit a lot of fairways and greens.   
 That's what I did today was I had a lot of chances.  Didn't miss too many greens.   
  
  Q.  How has the heat affected you?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  I love it.  I love this weather.  I hate cold weather, so this is great.   
  
  Q.  Great.  Thank you very much.
