Q.  Inaudible?
NATALIE GULBIS:  I hit an 8 iron in from maybe under 140 and took a hop and next thing I knew the crowd went nuts.  But it's always fun to make a good shot on 9 or 18.
Q.  You were one of the few people able to make a move today.  What was going right for you out there?
NATALIE GULBIS:  The eagle definitely helped but on the back nine I think I hit all nine.  I hit all nine fairways, or I hit all seven fairways.  That gave me a lot of opportunities to fire at pins and chances for birdie.
Q.  Course playing tough?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Very.  With the wind added in, and they have narrowed the fairways this year and the rough is very, very thick off the fairways.  You just have to wedge it out.
Q.  So the same idea for tomorrow?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah, same thing.  As far ahead as she is, just go out and hit a lot of fairways.  The pins, they are going to be tough on Sunday.
Q.  Inaudible?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Phenomenal player.  She's a great player.  She hits the ball really well.

Hits a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and a lot of chances to make putts.
Q.  Lots of different ways to win a tournament or a major
NATALIE GULBIS:  Depends on the weather.  If the weather is bad    but you still have to play good.

Not much breeze, only on a couple of holes and yesterday I only had breeze for like the last three holes.
Q.  Inaudible?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Pretty far back.  All I can worry about is that first tee shot, trying to hit that first fairway.
