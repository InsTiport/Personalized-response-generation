Q.  I'm here with Natalie Gulbis.  Outstanding Solheim Cup for you.  When I ask you the first two or three things that were positive, what comes to mind?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Just unbelievable.  To play in the whole week and then to win it, it's    we're so excited.  It's unbelievable.  The whole week has been, from the beginning to even before the week started, to all the team meetings and everything, getting a chance to play for Nancy Lopez, and we got our Cup back.

We're even more excited and we can't wait for Rosie to finish her match and we can celebrate as a team and get our trophies.
Q.  Did you have any idea of the potential magnitude of your match?
NATALIE GULBIS:  No, no, because Beth Daniel told me not to really watch the board, kind of take care of my business, get my point.  I was doing some interviews afterwards, I really had no idea.  I saw red on the board, which is always a good sign, but then I saw and found out, and Meg just made a huge point back there.
Q.  You more than did your business.  Congratulations on an outstanding Solheim Cup.
NATALIE GULBIS:  Thanks.
