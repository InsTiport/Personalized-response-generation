  Q.  Again, like Paula Creamer, you guys had a successful Solheim Cup two years ago and now you've won another.  What's it like doing it over here on foreign soil?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Huge.  Huge.  This is one we definitely wanted.  We had to defend the one we had two years ago.  This one was great.  To win over here is great.   
  
  Q.  What was it like to be one of the last few groups for Betsy to instill that confidence and if this thing was tight, it was going to come down to one of the last few matches?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  It was great.  I was really excited about the match.  I got off to a good start.  I was happy about that.  I found out on the green before I had a 15, 20-footer, I said, "Great, at 14, does that mean it's done?  Why am I putting?"   
  
  Q. Go celebrate with your team.  Congratulations.
