 Q.  Just talk about your round, obviously an unfortunate finish. 
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Not very excited at the moment to lose in the first round of the match play. 

 Q.  Were you able to have any fun? 
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah, there was some good small talk in between, not a lot just a little bit. 

 Q.  Can you talk about your round, what wasn't quite working and what you'll work on? 
 NATALIE GULBIS:  I hit a lot of shots right, so I'm definitely going to have to work on that. 

 Q.  Do you like the match-play format? 
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Oh, I love match-play format.  It's one of my favorite formats because you're really just playing the player so it's a lot of fun.
