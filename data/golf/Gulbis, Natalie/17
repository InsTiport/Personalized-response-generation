  Q. Natalie Gulbis and coassistant captain Meg Mallon. Meg, can you put into words what this whole moment is like? It's been two years in the making.   
 MEG MALLON: It sure has, and I'm ready to pass out. I tell you, these kids are great. They have so much energy, and they showed it today. They played their hearts out today.   
 And my hat's off to the Europeans. Unbelievable golf. I just love this tournament because it displays the best in women's golf.  
  
  Q. Natalie, what does it mean to you to be put in the anchor position to be in the position to possibly have to make the putt to win the Cup?  
 NATALIE GULBIS: Definitely an honor. They did it in Sweden and Meg gave me a great talk in Sweden, and when she put me in there again, that was definitely a big honor.
