Q.  Talk about today in general.
NATALIE GULBIS:  I wish every week was like this.  The week leading up to when we hit our first tee shot was great, the team meetings, the strategies, but also going out there in front of the fans.
Q.  Nothing like you expected probably?
NATALIE GULBIS:  You know, you kind of expect it, because you've heard all the stories and stuff, but to get out there and to feel what it's like to play in front of those people is pretty fun.  Really, really fun.
Q.  To finish up with a point?
NATALIE GULBIS:  It was good.  Cristie and I played really well in the morning, and to lose that first match was not good.  In the afternoon, we started really well and we were surprised it even went to 17, and so we're trying to carry it over to tomorrow morning.
Q.  How is your back?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Good.  I always get stretched out.  It's nothing different.
Q.  Tomorrow, you're ready to go 36 if need be?
NATALIE GULBIS:  I hope so.  I love it.  I can't get enough of it.
