Q.
Natalie, your first experience in Solheim Cup singles.  It must have exceeded your expectations.
NATALIE GULBIS:  Oh, by far.  To play in front of these galleries on a weekend, the galleries are huge.  It's so much fun.  I kind of miss having a teammate, though.  It was fun having a teammate and playing singles, but to be able to contribute to the team is a pretty great feeling.
Q.  Some of the legends of the game were following you around.  How did that feel?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Great.  Patty Sheehan coming up to see you, and Pat Bradley, it's great to have them all here and my teammates behind me.
Q.  It's been an amazing week.  Nancy Lopez deserves an a word clip?
NATALIE GULBIS:  Oh, absolutely, she deserves the best word of them all.  She's been a phenomenal captain, and I feel we had a lot to show for how she captained this week.
Q.  The very next question, can you smell a victory?
NATALIE GULBIS:  I hope we're close.  I haven't seen the exact score yet, but I hope so.
Q.  Thank you.
