   THE MODERATOR:  Lorena, talk about why you picked that spot. 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I like to know what is going on, so it's good to stay a little behind and see what I need to shoot. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Paula, what about you? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  I feel comfortable there.  I've played with Kimmy a lot now, so that will be a good group.  I like that spot.  I can kind of watch what's going on and I guess watch what's behind me, too. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Karrie, all four of the first four picks chose to hit first in one of the pairings.  Why? 
 KARRIE WEBB:  Well, I actually wanted if I had the chance to be in the second group tomorrow.  I think I was second group today, and I think if you get off to a good start, you're setting the pace out there.  That's why I chose that. 
 And first off, you don't have to watch what your playing partner does off the first tee, good or bad. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Cristie, for you this is sort of like a Solheim Cup match, get out there early and get a point on the board? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  Well, that was kind of tough to do with the weather this year.  But I just feel like being in the first group you get some good momentum going, you can continue that, and you won't have to wait on some of the groups later in the day on the last couple of holes. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Sarah Lee, you chose to go out with Karrie.  Why? 
 SARAH LEE:  I played with her today, and I really enjoyed playing with her, so maybe one more time. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Natalie, you and Lorena tomorrow? 
 NATALIE GULBIS:  I definitely wanted to play in the last group and I'm excited that that spot was open.  I've always enjoyed playing with Lorena, and being that she's the No. 1 player in the world, I want to be paired with the person that's the No. 1 player in the world. 
 THE MODERATOR:  I'm going to ask Mi Hyun Kim not about her pairing but about the last half hour of her day because I was a nervous wreck watching and describing it out there.  How did you go out and birdie the 17th hole after what happened at 16? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Well, I was a little upset.  I made a double bogey.  My mom told me whole score is gone after today, so don't matter, just make the cut.  So I just tried to start again at the 17th hole. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Are you looking forward to playing with Paula tomorrow? 
 MI HYUN KIM:  Yeah, I like to play with Paula (laughter). 

 Q.  Christina, what was your pick?  What was the strategy? 
 CHRISTINA KIM:  I like being the last one coming in because everybody makes the decision for me.  It's a group of CKs and there's nothing better than setting the pace.  She and I are going to go out there and show them what's up. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Congratulations to our contestants.
