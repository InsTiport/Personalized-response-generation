 Q. You're one of the few players under par today. 
 NATALIE GULBIS: Yeah, it was tough. The pin placements were tougher. They had more weekend pins than I think we usually see.

 Q. Are you hitting it well?
 NATALIE GULBIS: Yeah, good. 

 Q. How are you feeling?
 NATALIE GULBIS: Healthy. I had a really nice off-season.

 Q. What did you do during the off-season? 
 NATALIE GULBIS: Practised. I haven't practised in quite a few years because I've been injured most off seasons, repairing injuries. It's the first healthy off-season I've really had in a long time. 

 Q. Great round, you're only one of ten players under par; how difficult is the course today?
 NATALIE GULBIS: Yeah, the golf course, they had a lot of pin placements on holes that were difficult and the course played harder than we all expected in our first round at Tanah Merah. 

 Q. A couple of bogeys but you made some really good birdies on 15 and 16. 
 NATALIE GULBIS: A couple bogeys which I think are to be expected out there, but it's always nice to take advantage of the holes that you can; the par 5 and that short par 4, and made a couple of birdies and hope to do more of the same tomorrow.

 Q. What is the key to playing this course well? It's quite long and the wind has really got up. Is it all about the pins?
 NATALIE GULBIS: It's all about ball-striking. Here I think you really have to keep the ball in the fairway and put the ball in the right spot on these greens, because if you're in the wrong spot, you're going have a long putt and the greens are treacherous. So it definitely puts a premium on your ball striking.

 Q. Good to see you at the top of the leaderboard, because it's been a tough couple of years with injury but you're feeling good for 2011?
 NATALIE GULBIS: I do. I feel great and it's always nice to be back in Singapore..
