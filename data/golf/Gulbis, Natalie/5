Q.   What was the last event actually?
NATALIE GULBIS:   The U.S. Open in July.   I played a couple events on sponsor invites, played two in Asia and then I played Lorena's events, Lorena's tournament in MÃ©xico, but I had only played 18 holes.   This is a great‑‑ I don't like‑‑ like 18 holes walking, I went to MÃ©xico a week ago with Lorena, and that was the only time since the Lorena Ochoa event that I played 18 holes walking.   I zipped around and played 18 holes a couple times in the last week, but I've only been back practicing a couple of weeks. 

Q.   So what was the injury?   Take me through it.   Did you end up having surgery?
NATALIE GULBIS:   I had like where they cleaned up the tears in my hip, right around Thanksgiving, which I was trying to‑‑ first I went the conservative way where you have PT and you take rest, and then I went out and played and it wasn't any better.

Q.   How long were you doing that for?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Hyperbaric and PRP, which is where they go in and they‑‑ I need to read more about it, but I tried everything to try to come back.

Q.   Is that the blood spinning thing?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, PRP?   It hurts like so bad.   They're like, yeah, it's not that bad.   They take your blood out and spin it.

Q.   They put it back in?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, and they take your own blood and they spin it and they put it back in.   A lot of players out here have actually had it, and it hurts so bad, though.   It's not like one shot, it's like a bazillion shots, but probably hyperbaric was the hardest because it takes like an hour and a half and you just sit there in this chamber.   But I wanted to come back for Ocala and for obviously this event being PureSilk, and then I won't play again until Phoenix. 

Q.   So obviously you feel pretty good?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, the last week I felt really good.   Knock on wood. 

Q.   Take us through today a little bit.   Our scoring is a little off.   Anything that stuck out today?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, I was excited when I was at 13, so I figured I could just go to 17.   I hit it good.   The last couple weeks that I have been able to practice, I've been practicing a lot and spent a lot of time with Butch and a lot of time at TaylorMade, and I have some new equipment.   It's been like any other getting ready for the season.   I didn't play last week.   I wasn't quite ready last week.   I'm just happy to be back. 

Q.   New equipment, what did you have in the bag?
NATALIE GULBIS:   New driver, new rescue, new wedges.

Q.   All TaylorMade?
NATALIE GULBIS:   All TaylorMade.   New driver I think is the biggest difference just because I hit it further, and this course is easier hitting it‑‑ even though it was windy, I probably hit it 10 yards further, 10, 15 yards further than last time, and I could reach par‑5s that I couldn't reach last year.

Q.   That's exciting.   What's the‑‑
NATALIE GULBIS:   It's an Aero Burner.

Q.   What about the wind out there?   It picked up later in the day?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, when we got to 9.   You know, we didn't have any wind until like 9, and then 9 through the pretty holes out there, 13, 14, it was pretty gnarly, and then it was like this.   This was the good side.   You saw the scores there.   Like right now, this is pretty‑‑ the course is in great shape.   The greens are easy to putt on.

Q.   What about being part of the PureSilk family.   I know there's a big group of you. 
NATALIE GULBIS:   Awesome.   Tonight we have a really cool dinner.   It's in the aquarium, in the Atlantis.   It's so trippy because you're eating your dinner and there's like stingrays and fish.   It's one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to, but I love this Atlantis.   I'm a beach girl, so I haven't been able to go down the slides or anything like that yet, but I do all my workouts on the beach and go in the ocean every day, anything to‑‑ we don't have a lot of time, but it is a PureSilk week.   Once I get back from practice and work out, there's not much time.

Q.   You and Lizette did the chairman's message, I guess?   Did they ask you to do that?
NATALIE GULBIS:   Yeah, we did that yesterday.

Q.   And that was just for PureSilk?
NATALIE GULBIS:   On behalf (inaudible) you've seen all this stuff.   We had the party that one night.   And then on Saturday we're going to go to a friend here that has one of those big boats, and we're going to go out fishing.   He promised that we'd catch something.   He said sometime this weekend.   The same boat that the Golf Channel is going out on today.
