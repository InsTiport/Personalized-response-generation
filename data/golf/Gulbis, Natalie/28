  Q.  Are you surprised it may take 70 get in?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah, I am, actually.  I thought for sure that under par would make it going in, but there's not really any wind.  I thought they might do the pins a little bit harder than they did.   
  
  Q.  You've been in a playoff already this week.  Do you think it will help you today if it gets to that point?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Well, I hope that I'm in the playoff, really.  You know, I'd love to be in.  If I'm in a playoff I'm looking forward to that, as well, just having the chance to get into Sunday.  That's all you can really ask for is just get a chance to get in.   
  
  Q.  With an hour-plus break between finishing your round and potentially going to the playoff, does that help, hurt, does it matter?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  It doesn't matter.  You know, you when you get out there you've got to hit the shot.  I've done this a couple times so I'll probably go back and talk to you guys, sign a few autographs, and warm up and go back, get ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  At what point did you kind of tell yourself, okay, it's going to be under par and I've got to get going here?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  14.  I really hadn't hit the ball all that great, and I got to 14 and I just made bogey, and I saw the board and it was at 2 or 3.  You don't want to have to really try to make those sort of birdies coming in, but you've just got to give it a chance, have to give yourself a chance to get into tomorrow, and that's really what makes this format so exciting.   
  
  Q.  Survive and advance?   
 NATALIE GULBIS:  Yeah, survive and advance.
