PAUL ROVNAK:  Natalie, thanks for speaking with us before you take off for the day.  The round has been canceled.  You are playing fairly well.
NATALIE GULBIS:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Before we get to talk about the conditions out there, how cold was it?  Were you miserable out there?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Not as bad as it has been for a lot of our events.  It was cold, rainy wet.  The course played longer, the officials shortened it up.  It was nonstop rain.  Not too much wind, so that was nice.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll Take some questions.
Q.  What was your reaction to them?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Not too excited at that moment.  You know, I don't know how many holes played.  I played seven holes, I was 1 under.  That would have been good with perfect conditions on this golf course.  To know that you warmed up and kind of grind it for those seven holes, to know that we have to play and the afternoon people might not have to play, to be at 1 under to have that erased.
Q.  Does that happen all the time?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
I never seen it in four years.  This is my forth year on tour, I have never seen them take away scores.  Usually you just continue where you finish and then we go about tomorrow.  Kind of luck of the draw that happens every week.

Last week we played Tennessee.  I played in the morning on Thursday, I had horrible weather, then in the afternoon it was nice.  The reverse day players had lots of delays and I slept in.  You always have that throughout the season and it evens out.  I've never seen it where they actually take away scores.  I was playing with players who were 4  and 5 over for those holes.  It is nice for them.
Q.  Did they give you any explanation as to why they did it this way?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
No.  I don't know.
Q.  At the PLAYERS Championship, the men's event in March, they did a similar thing.  Some of the players started out hot and they had their scores erased.  They say golf is about weather .
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Absolutely.  The officials let us play.  This is such a big event for us; it is pretty much a major.  I would be happy with being 1 under in seven in good weather.
Q.  How did you birdie that hole by the way?  There weren't very many of them out there?
NATALIE GULBIS:  I had a birdie putt on the first hole, didn't make it.  The birdie putt on 5 didn't make it.  I hit in the fairway on 7 and they called it.  I am surprised they called it.  The greens weren't underwater.  That is usually what happens.
Q.  They were not?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Not even close.  The tee box were really wet.  The course was starting to get wet.
Q.  How were the conditions?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Just kind of nonstop rain.  You had the umbrella up all the time.  Like you said, with golf we know on East coast we will have crummy weather.
Q.  With the purse that they carry on this tournament, would you like to see them play Monday and stretch it out and play 72 if they have to?
NATALIE GULBIS:  I don't know because next week is a big event, too.  You have people that have travel plans and a lot of different things.  They can play.  That is what is weird.  I thought they could finish this and get the holes in tomorrow.  I would rather see them do 54 holes than have to play 36 on Sunday.  I have never seen one of our events go to a Monday unless it is a major.  You never know.  It is new every week.
Q.  What is it like for you when you do come to the course on a day like this and you are being sent out?  Do you have to do anything mentally to get yourself in a frame?  Do you change your approach?  Do you get tougher?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
You have to be tougher because I had 3 irons and 4 irons and 5 irons that usually have 8 irons, 9 irons or pitching wedges.  You know it will be tough.  You have to make pars and lean on your short game a little bit.  It was going to be tougher out there today and longer.  It was probably going to be six and half hour rounds out there, a little bit longer.
Q.  Are there some practical things, too?  Are you wearing more clothes?  Does that affect your swing in any way?
NATALIE GULBIS:  My swing is shorter.  I'm not hitting the ball as far.  As soon as we take a distance we add 20 right away to just being cold.  The swing is limited, the air is heavy.
Q.  That underarmor is a great invention?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Yeah, if Adidas made it...
Q.  How old you characterize some of your fellow players?  Were they mystified?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
I don't know.
Q.  How about you?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
I haven't talked to any of them.  I am frustrated.  What can you do?  Go out tomorrow.  I am still in, I was 2 under yesterday.  I am in a good spot.  Take the day off and start tomorrow.
Q.  What do you do on a day like today?
NATALIE GULBIS:  
Go work out, grab something to eat, relax, maybe go to a movie, find Cristie Kerr and see if she wants to go shopping.  We spend a lot of weather delays together.  Wake her up.  I don't know if she has woken up for this tee time.  She was in the afternoon.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Any more questions for Natalie?  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in Natalie.
