  NATALIE GULBIS:   Some good and some bad.   I got off to a good start, and then just didn't really do much after that.  
Overall, good.   I knew that scores would be low.   I saw the pin sheet, and the conditions were very generous for scoring.  
   
 Q.   Were there a few pins that were a little surprising?  
NATALIE GULBIS:   No, not really.   I've been here for I think every year they've had the event, so there are a lot of pins that are similar to years past.  
   
 Q.   How are you striking the ball?  
NATALIE GULBIS:   Good.   Actually still have bit of practice for my afternoon round tomorrow.   Overall, good.  
   
 Q.   How are feeling in the heat?   
NATALIE GULBIS:   Great.   Really good, thank you.   I love the heat.   Feels wonderful.   You're nice and loose.   Definitely still look for shade, but it's nice.  
   
 Q.   A Vegas girl.   
NATALIE GULBIS:   I am.   When I left Vegas before the last two events it was like 117, 119, 120.   It's a little humid here, though.
