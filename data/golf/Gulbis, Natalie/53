Q.  I'm here with an exuberant Natalie Gulbis.  What a record in your first Solheim Cup, 2, 2 and 0.  Today was awesome.
NATALIE GULBIS:  Thank you, thank you.  Still shaking a little bit.  It's been such an amazing week.  I can't believe it's over.  There is a lot of red on the board.  Hopefully we finish this off as a team.
Q.  You had a lot of Americans pulling for you.  Very popular young player.  What do you have to say to other young players out there who want to come out here and do what you did?
NATALIE GULBIS:  This was worth every bit of work I've put into it.  Being on the golf course, it's been amazing, and it's been the best thing.
Q.  What was it like being Captained by Nancy Lopez?
NATALIE GULBIS:  It's somebody I have looked up to for a long time, and just to have the opportunity to play for her, to see her at 5:30 in the morning getting everybody all fired up, it's pretty amazing.
Q.  Congratulations.  Way to show up for the Americans.
NATALIE GULBIS:  Thank you.  Thank you.
