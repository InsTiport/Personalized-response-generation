Q. Leading Malaysian in the clubhouse, how do you feel?
WINNIE NG: I was really surprised that my ball was going to the pin today.  I had a lot less than six feet.  I think I had about five or six birdies today.  That is a good round.  Despite that I have two doubles in a row, hole No. 2 and hole No. 3.
Q. So you are attacking the pins today and everything was landing?
WINNIE NG: I wasn't attacking the pins because my game plan was to hit it to the middle of the green.  Somehow when I was doing my pre-shot routine, suddenly I was seeing the pin in my pre-shot routine.  I just hit it and the ball went to the pin.  I'm really surprised today.
Q. So even before and after the rain, did anything affect your game?
WINNIE NG: Before the rain delay, I had a double and then I had a putt for bogey to go, and then I was really down and I was really sad.  So I went back to the club and I ate a lot.  I ate cake.  I drank a lot.  I told myself, you know, sometimes bad things happen, but it's the way you respond to it.  You have a choice to feel good or feel bad.  Just go there and have no expectation and just play your game.
Q. You must be very happy with the way you bounced back from the two double-bogeys, birdie, birdie.
WINNIE NG: Yeah, I was really happy.  After that, I just hit to the pin.  I don't know how, I was like aiming to the green and the ball just goes to the pin.  I managed to putt the ball in and I'm really happy.
Q. If at the start of the way I gave you even par after two rounds, would you be happy?
WINNIE NG: Yes, I'm really happy.
