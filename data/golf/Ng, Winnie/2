 Q.  So tell us about your round.  
WINNIE NG: Before crossing over, I had two bogeys and two birdies, so I was even.  And after crossing over, I'm like really tired and then I was -- suddenly I feel the game is quite tough for me because like I'm losing distance and my ball is missing the greens a lot.  So I had four bogeys the back nine.   
 Q.  Why do you think your ball is missing the green?  Is it the way you're hitting off the drive?  
WINNIE NG: The second shot, I'm forcing it a bit because I'm a bit tired.  It's quite hot today and maybe I'm not really prepared for the whole week because I've been training since the last week.   
 Q.  Would you say the heat is taking a toll on you?  
WINNIE NG: Maybe I have to rest for this afternoon and then I will be better tomorrow.   
 Q.  What's your game plan?  
WINNIE NG: My game plan is to play safe, play like a professional, hit for the middle of the green and hope for the best.   
 Q.  The change of flight, is there any difference?  
WINNIE NG: They are still friendly but we are more serious today.  I don't know, maybe I'm a bit stressed about my game today.   
 Q.  Were you getting frustrated out there?  
WINNIE NG: More like depressed.   
 Q.  But you didn't like mentally psyche up yourself like yesterday?  
WINNIE NG: I did, but it's golf.  You can't always play well.  I was trying to maintain it, and I was doing quite well.  I didn't get a lot of birdies.  I missed a lot of putts and I couldn't get it on the green.   
 Q.  Who was following you today?  
WINNIE NG: My dad and my dad's friends, and some of the Koreans.   
 Q.  So basically they were like, calm down or whatever?  
WINNIE NG: Yeah, they asked me to relax.  I mean, I'm relaxed.  It's just not my day today.
