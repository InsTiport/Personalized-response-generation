Q. Another round of 70 here at the British Masters but a really good day out there for you on the golf course?
JULIAN GUERRIER: I'm really happy to play under par again.  It's tough conditions.  The wind was a little bit less windy.  I played a good round.  I was very often in a birdie position, which is good.
Q. You hit a lot of greens and your putting was tremendous.  How much did that help your round today?
JULIAN GUERRIER: The key here, it's hit the green first, and after I try to make two putts, and you are close and you can hole the putts, it's a bonus.  It's a game where you have to hit fairways, greens, like everywhere, but especially here because the heather is quite close.
Q. You've only dropped four shots all week.  How good is that around this place given the conditions?
JULIAN GUERRIER: Yeah, I played pretty well.  I just dropped a shot to finish my second round this morning, but it can happen.  I'm human.  But I played really good, and I hope to play the same way tomorrow.
Q. What do you need to do tomorrow to give yourself every chance?
JULIAN GUERRIER: Try to stay focused because I'm a little bit tired and the season is long.  It's the end, so if I stay focused and keep concentration very high, it's good.
Q. What would it mean to you to win the British Masters?
JULIAN GUERRIER: To win the British Masters, really good, in the windy conditions.  It's windy here.  I come from Golf de la Pree La Rochelle, and it's very windy there.  I think I learned how to do well in the wind.
