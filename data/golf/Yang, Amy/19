 Q.  It's your birthday today.  Is that a happy celebration, playing in that wind?  
AMY YANG: When I went on to the golf course, I totally forgot it was just my birthday.  I just focused how I'm going to play, but you know, a lot of people wished me a happy birthday today.  Wonderful day, yeah.   
 Q.  Tied for the lead, with a chance to win an LPGA title tomorrow, that must be a good present?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I guess.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to tomorrow, would you prefer the conditions to be difficult like they are now or do you think would you prefer it to be a bit calmer?  
AMY YANG: You know, either one.  I don't mind.  I'll do my best on the course.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to next week, is this great preparation to master your skills in these conditions?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, it is.  Get used to the time zone and get used to the conditions like this and I have a good -- if I finish good this week, take it into next week, as well.  It's good.   
 Q.  Have you been working on low shots ahead of this week, or is there something you've had to adapt to now that the weather's changed?  Were you working on the low shots on Monday and Tuesday, or have you just had to start bringing them in now that it's become windy?  
AMY YANG: I've been practising low shots maybe a few months ago, getting ready for this.
