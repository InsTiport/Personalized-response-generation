 Q.  Amy, great round:  4-under total for the day.  Can you tell us about what went well today?  
AMY YANG: You know, it was pretty windy out there today, but shots were very solid out there.  I gave myself a lot of good chances and my putting was also good.   
 Q.  Yeah.  You've talk about an arm injury.  I think you mentioned it started hurting at the beginning of the season.  
AMY YANG: Yeah.  Started around early April, but, you know, it's recovering really fast.  So it's almost -- almost I don't feel much right now.  I just keep massaging it and limit how many balls I hit a day.   
I'm doing good.   
 Q.  So are you thinking more long-term rather than just short-term in terms ever rehab and training and getting better?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't just stop playing for a while.  I mean, I can still hit and play, so I'm just going to keep playing.   
 Q.  Great.  Are you going to do anything different for tomorrow?  
AMY YANG: No.  Just same thing.  You know, same exact thing.  But I think it will be better in the morning because we will have fresh greens and hopefully a little less wind.  It was very windy today.   
Yeah, I'm looking forward.
