 Q.   You played very well today.   Tell us about your round.  
AMY YANG:   I had a great day today.   My ball striking was good.   It was windy conditions, but it was good play.  
   
 Q.   Were there any particular holes that stood out to you that really helped your round today?  
AMY YANG:   It was quite a lot.   I had some good shots to the greens.   Had good chances.  
   
 Q.   You said it was a little windy today.   Compare the first two rounds to playing today in the wind.  
AMY YANG:   It's a lot different.   Almost there was no wind last two days, but it was 15 to 20 miles, and it made the course a little bit drier and hard to play.   
Thankfully my striking was good, and it's great.  
   
 Q.   What was it like with all the spectators out today watching?  
AMY YANG:   You know, it's always so great out here, the U. S. Open, a lot of people.   I like to play in this crowd.  
   
 Q.   Did you think the course setup was more difficult today than it was the first two days, outside of the wind?   Do you think they set it up harder today because of the low scores?  
AMY YANG:   I think all three days was hard.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And now looking at tomorrow you're real close to the top of the leaderboard.   What kind of changes in your mind and how do you look at playing differently tomorrow?  
AMY YANG:   Nothing change.   I'm just going to keep being patient tomorrow, try to do my best.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised that you were the first person to break 70 today?  
AMY YANG:   Oh, I was?   Like I said before, I was hitting the ball so good.   So yeah, it feels good.  
   
 Q.   I guess last I looked, you're third on the leaderboard now but Na Yeon is minus 7?  
AMY YANG:   Yeah.   She's playing good.  
   
 Q.   Does Na Yeon have the type of game to really excel at an Open.   Tell me a little bit about her game.  
AMY YANG:   Her game is really good, you know.   Everything she hits the ball so good, putting very good, and it's ‑‑ yeah.   I think she's a great player.  
   
 Q.   It's an Open.   Her game fits an Open setup?  
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   Were you scoreboard watching at all today?   Were you kind of keeping track and know what you had to do to make that move?  
AMY YANG:   I was watching it, but I didn't really try to make birdies to get up there, you know.   Just same play.
