  Q. How was it out there today?   
 AMY YANG: Oh, it was tough. I mean, I started really bad. It was tougher than yesterday. That's what I felt.  
  
  Q. You've got a score that's over par and you're the best score on the leaderboard that's finished today. What do you think about that?  
 AMY YANG: Um, you know, like I say it's really tough out there.   
 And also the wind picked up. I'm not sure. I just had a really tough day.  
  
  Q. The pace of play, does that unnerve you at all?  
 AMY YANG: No, I'm okay with that. Just a little bit of waiting. Make me like more thinking get ready for the next shot.  
  
  Q. Was there a perceptible difference in how the course played today, or was it about the same?  
 AMY YANG: It's about the same, but I think course setup is little tougher than yesterday.  
  
  Q. In what ways, would you say?  
 AMY YANG: Well, like pins, mostly, the pins. Yeah, that was tough.  
  
  Q. And your game was just a little bit different or was was it mostly because of how the course was set up harder?  
 AMY YANG: Course setup was, but also I wasn't hitting it well like front nine. I just missed some fairway. And, you know, if I miss fairway, it's so hard to get (indiscernible) two, especially I went in the bunker a lot today. It was tough day.  
  
  Q. How about the church pews? Did you hit into them on 3 and 4, the bunkers that are aligned?  
 AMY YANG: No, I didn't go in there. But like greenside bunkers, they are still really high and tough.  
  
  Q. You played well, anyway. You're in a good position. Appreciate it.   
 AMY YANG: Thank you.
