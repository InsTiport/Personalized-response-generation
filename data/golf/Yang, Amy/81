Q.   What went well for you today? 
AMY YANG:   It was a great day.   It was tough in the afternoon, back nine.   It was windy, but my driver tee shot off the tee, I think I kept it really well in the fairway, and that helped me make better shots to the green, and a couple putts falling.

Q.   You had a really good finish here last year.   Were you looking forward to coming back?
AMY YANG:   Yeah, this is one of my favorite tournaments, and this is the first major, and I really love this place. 

Q.   Coming off of an off week, did you work on anything specific after Kia?
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I just started working with a new coach, and we've been working on our swing and putting.   Mentally, too.   It was good. 

Q.   How is working with the new coach?   Was there any difficulties with the transition or everything has been positive? 
AMY YANG:   Yeah, actually I'm playing better.   Yeah, I'm hitting the ball better.   I feel great. 

Q.   Anything specifically that he saw that really helped improve on your swing?   Did he change anything?
AMY YANG:   Not much, not much, yeah.

Q.   So looking into obviously getting off to a good start.   What do you want to do going into the next three rounds? 
AMY YANG:   My course strategy is always the same.   I like to keep it simple, and just going to‑‑ just like today, because it's a major tournament and the rough is so thick and long, I want to‑‑ like today, keep the ball in the fairway.   I think that's very important.

Q.   Did you miss any fairways today?   Did you find it in the rough?
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I did.   It's thick, yeah.   But luckily I was in a better spot.
