  Q. Being one shot out of the lead heading into Sunday, how nice of a feeling is that for you?   
 AMY YANG: I haven't been that position too much, but I think that way is, you know, more better than one-shot lead. Probably a little nervous, you know.   
  
  Q. Yeah, I was going to say, no pressure then when you're not in the lead. Is there less pressure then when you're coming from behind?  
 AMY YANG: It's kind of less pressure, you know. Still in the top, so still going to be a little pressure, but less pressure than one-shot lead.  
  
  Q. Today's round, even par, a lot of pars, not many birdies, bogeys. Was it consistent for you or just not a lot of opportunities? How would you describe your round?  
 AMY YANG: I had little tough day. It was a little more breeze today. That made greens faster and firmer. But although I had some chances for birdies, I had tough time with putting.  
 But it was a good day. I had some good par saves.
