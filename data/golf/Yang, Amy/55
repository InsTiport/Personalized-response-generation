 Q.  Becoming a bit of a habit having a chat to you.  You are in really good form at the moment?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I've been hitting good today.  Hit a lot of good second shots from the fairway, even bunker shots to save myself a lot of opportunities out there.  If I could make some more putts, it would have been better.  But it is very solid today.  I'm happy how I did.   
 Q.  5-under 67, that's a good round of golf any day.  
AMY YANG: Yeah, it's great.  I just gave myself a lot of good opportunities, a lot of 15-footers, 15-, 18-footers for birdie putts.  Yeah, a great day.   
 Q.  You just posted a really good score.  Now you're going to sit back and enjoy lunch because the weather looks like expected thunderstorms.  That's not such a bad thing, is it?  
AMY YANG: Yeah but yesterday we had tough conditions.  It was very windy.  Honestly right now, it's better weather right now.   
 Q.  Although it's overcast, we've had a sprinkling of rain and breeze.  It makes the playing conditions more comfortable, doesn't it?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, the heat, it can make you like tired.  But it's better today.   
 Q.  And you've had beef jerky to keep you going around the course?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I was hungry, so it was good.   
 Q.  What did you feel was the difference between today and yesterday?  
AMY YANG: The wind, it was a lot.  It was very windy yesterday, like some holes we had to like play out to the water and yeah, turning in.  It was hard to trust that shot.  Other than that, made some more putts today.  I'm hitting it very good now, last week and this week.
