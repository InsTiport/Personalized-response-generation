Q. How nervous were you?
AMY YANG: Oh, I was honestly very nervous, especially last three holes.  It was tough hole to finish.  I was really telling myself just be patient, do best at the time.
I think I did great today.  I'm so happy.
Q. You certainly did great.  What is it about this golf course?  You're a three-time winner.
AMY YANG: You know, not sure.  I'm just enjoy coming here.  I love the golf course; I love the tournament.  Just enjoying it so much.
Q. On the last putt you had the eagle putt opportunity, downhill, and it was quick.  What were you thinking?
AMY YANG: Yeah, I mean, if I make the putt it would be better, but I knew how fast it was.  I didn't want to hit it so hard.
Yeah, but I did good, and I'm very happy.
Not sure why, but it is a very special tournament for me.  I'm very happy to have three wins here, yeah.
Q. Although it got a little too close and exciting than you would've liked, I'm sure, you were tied for the lead with four holes to go.  How aware were you and how were you able to tackle that?
AMY YANG: Yeah, you know, I know at one point I was sharing the lead, but all I tried to do was just keep focusing on and just be patient and do best at the time, yeah.
Q. Finally, I know you must have a million people to thank, so I would like to give you this opportunity to say a few words to your fans and supporters.
AMY YANG: I want to thank my team, you know, family, friends, coach.  Coach Sean, caddie Kevin.  They help me a lot.  Without them I'm sure I couldn't do this.
I also specially like to thank Honda for a great event.  Also SAT and SDF, TAT, Siam Country Club, IMG sponsors, volunteers and fans.  Thank you very much.  I'm looking forward to seeing you guys again next year.
