 Q.  Tell me about your round out there.  
AMY YANG: You know, a lot of things worked well together today.  I was hitting balls very solid out there; gave myself lots of good chances; also putting was working well.   
I'm happy with how I played today.  Bogey-free round.   
 Q.  What was the highlight of your round?  
AMY YANG: Highlight?  I just remember I putted well today.  Some good par saves and just kind of easy.   
 Q.  How are you health-wise?  We know after you won in Thailand you had to withdraw.  
AMY YANG: Oh, yeah.  I'm fully better now.  100%, yeah.  Was a flu, I think.  I wasn't feeling so well.   
Healthy right now.   
 Q.  How much confidence does that win so early in the season give you moving on for this year?  
AMY YANG: I mean, a lot, you know.  Feels like I can do it another one, so I'll just keep work hard.   
 Q.  How special is it to have the Founders here on 18 when you're finishing?  
AMY YANG: I mean it's very special, isn't it?  I'm honored to see them, and I'm so, what can I say?  Don't know the word.  Really thankful what they did for us, yeah.
