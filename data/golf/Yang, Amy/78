 Q.   Nice start to the round.   Three straight birdies to open up.   What was working really well on those first three holes‑‑  
AMY YANG:   I was hitting the ball very solid in the morning, I mean all day today.   That helped me a lot.   I hit three of them really close, inside six feet.   Yeah, so it was a good chance.  
   
 Q.   Nice.   Anything specific you've been working on in the swing that you feel like is kind of coming together right now?  
AMY YANG:   I'm working on my new swing because I started with new coach and has a little up‑and‑down, but it's getting better.  
   
 Q.   When did you start with the new coach?  
AMY YANG:   Middle of last season.   It's kind of hard to change it.  
   
 Q.   Yeah.   No doubt.   It takes a while to get it down.   What's your new coach's name?  
AMY YANG:   Ryan Mock.  
   
 Q.   And then just over all, this golf course.   Is it a golf course that seems to suit your game pretty well?  
AMY YANG:   Oh, yeah.   I really like it.   It's‑‑ I don't know.   I just like it.   Like I really like it here.  
   
 Q.   Does it suit your eye, like some when you see off the tee it's one of those that really seems to‑‑  
AMY YANG:   Yes.   It's in great shape and the greens are really, really nice, so I can hit the ball really pure.   Just I love it.  
   
 Q.   We're coming down, after next week, after Kia, teams are being chosen for International Crown all of the players.   And you're right there on the bubble for that final spot for South Korea.   What would it mean to you to be on that team, to be one of those four players?  
AMY YANG:   Oh, it would be very honored.   
And I'm not in there yet, but it would be very honored, and it will be like‑‑ it will be like huge experience in my golf career.   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   Definitely.   Awesome.
