Q. You reeled off nine consecutive birdies last year in South Korea and doing a similar fear this afternoon, well played.
AMY YANG: It was kind of frustrating, the first nine, shooting 1-over par without any birdies.  But I never gave up.  Kept trying, trying, and the 11th hole birdie made good momentum.  I'm happy how I finished strongly.
Q. You're looking really good going into tomorrow.  Everybody seems to be playing great golf.
AMY YANG: Yeah, tomorrow, every shot will be important, so I'll focus one shot at a time and be patient, also enjoy.
Q. You leapt up five places in the Rolex Rankings last week to No. 7.  Keep going and you'll be No. 1 in a few months' time.
AMY YANG: That's one of my ultimate goals for my golf career.  I'll do my best.
Q. Were you just in the zone?
AMY YANG: Yeah, I never gave up.  My front nine wasn't very good.  Starting with a bogey on the second hole and just parred until No. 9 hole.  It was a little frustrating but I never gave up.  Just keep trying.  Me and my caddie, we talked, just keep doing what we're doing.  Good to finish with 31 on the back nine.
Q. It's a fantastic score.  You didn't really get it going on the front nine.  Why was that?
AMY YANG: I don't know.  I was hitting it okay.  Just maybe couldn't make some putts.  I just didn't have good momentum going on.  Oh, well.
Q. What will you focus on tomorrow?
AMY YANG: Tomorrow, I'll just focus on what I can control tomorrow, which is one shot at a time.  You only can control yourself and your ball.  So be patient and just have fun tomorrow.
Q. You're just two shots off the lead, you must be very happy?
AMY YANG: Yes, I am.  I'm looking forward to play final round tomorrow.
