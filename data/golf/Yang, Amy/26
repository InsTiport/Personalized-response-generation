Q. Remind me where you finished.  5-under?
AMY YANG: Uh-huh, 5-under; birdied 18.  It was a little close.  I thought about, you know, maybe go for it or not.
Q. Go for eagle?
AMY YANG: I went for it.  I want to make another birdie.
Q. How long was the birdie?
AMY YANG: Birdie putt was six feet.
Q. Nice.
AMY YANG: Yeah.
Q. So it's got to feel good to finish the round that way?
AMY YANG: Yeah.
Q. You always play so well here.  What is it about this place?
AMY YANG: First of all, I want to say, you know, I also had some not good finishes here.
It's golf.  It's different every time.
Q. You have seven top 12 finishes here if I remember correctly.
AMY YANG: Oh, really?
Q. Only once have you finished outside the top 12.  I think that's pretty good.
AMY YANG: Yeah, I think so.  I just love coming back here.  I love the golf course.  It really suits my eye.  I like the grass.  Just like a lot of things about it.
Q. What was the best moment of your round today for you?  I think you birdied the first two holes if I remember correctly.
AMY YANG: No, 10 and 11.
Q. Yes?
AMY YANG: Just I want to say just my patience out there.  It was very hot.  There is some like important moment that I had to focus on.  I think I controlled myself out there.
Q. And that's hard to do, especially in this heat.
AMY YANG: Yeah.  I had a little umbrella, so held it all day and tried to drink a lot.  Relaxed.
Q. Do you drink water?  Power drinks?
AMY YANG: Mix.  You know, water and Gatorade.  Half and half.
Q. Clearly worked for you.  Great job today.
AMY YANG: Thank you.
