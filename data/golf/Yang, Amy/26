 Q.  Solid round of golf today:  69.  Dropped a couple of shots on the back nine; not as good as you have been in previous editions.  
AMY YANG: You know what?  I did my best out there.  I started really good, three birdies in a row, but I made mistakes here and there a little bit.   
Still had a good day.   
 Q.  You certainly did.  We are amazed that you are 50-under par for the last three editions of this tournament.  Did you know that?  
AMY YANG: No, I didn't know that.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Well, you are, and you're certainly more now after another solid round.  If you had to take a golf course away for the rest of your life, would this be the one?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, maybe.  I always enjoy playing in Thailand, and Siam Country Club.  Always every year really looking forward to coming here.   
 Q.  Well played today.  Great golf.  You've got to stay in touch with the leaders though.  A lot of birdies out there.  
AMY YANG: Yeah, going to go back to the range a little, work on swing a little.  Really going to be fun weekend, you know.
