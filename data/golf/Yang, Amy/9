Q. Amy, 2-under for today.  What was the key to your game today?
AMY YANG: You know, honestly I wasn't hitting very good out there today, but made some really good par saves, many of them out there.  It was playing very tough.  The wind start blowing early and fairways are very tight and rough is so long.
I been lucky.  When I hit into the rough I could see my ball and actually play from there to the greens.  I think I got lucky today.
Q. Said a lot of par saves and the fairways were really tight for you.
AMY YANG: Yeah.
Q. Talk about your short game and how important that was.
AMY YANG: I mean, the good par saves gave me good momentum going for rest of the round.  Yeah, I think that was very helpful out there.
Q. And your goal for the week?
AMY YANG: Goal for the week?
Q. Just do well?
AMY YANG: Yeah, do well.
Q. Do you feel like because you had a win at the beginning of the season that gave you more confidence going into this week?
AMY YANG: Yeah, of course.  Just like after long off-season, you know, practice for more than a month, and always -- how can I say -- want to see how much I improve and also nervous about how the season is going to go.
That winning gave me a lot of confidence, and just keep do what I do.
