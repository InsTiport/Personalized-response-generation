Q.   There were so many dramatic twists and turns on the back nine.   I think I can hear your heart beating from here.
AMY YANG:   Oh, my gosh, yeah.   I was a little bit nervous out there, but I tried to focus on how low I can go today, just focus on my game. 

Q.   You played beautifully on the front nine.   Very steady golf indeed.   When we got on the 14th, Stacy Lewis drew level; when you dropped a shot, she made a birdie.   What was going through your mind?
AMY YANG:   I was try to focus, but I guess I just had a missed tee shot to the right.   It wasn't easy.

Q.   Then Lewis dropping a couple shots and playing the 18th hole, you went into the bunker with your second. 
AMY YANG:   I don't know if I wait a little long or not.   I hit a little behind my second shot, but happy finishing par. 

Q.   Second win on the LPGA.   Must mean a great deal to you?
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I just don't know what happened now.   Feels great. 

Q.   Amy, how are you feeling right now?   Have to be thrilled. 
AMY YANG:   I don't know what just happened.   I still can't believe I did it today.

Q.   What does it mean to have all your friends on tour pouring water on you, to feel the love, the friendship?   Does it make you happy to have your friends supporting you? 
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I have a lot of friends out here.   We enjoy traveling together so much.   They're all‑‑ I don't know.   I don't know what to say.

Q.   Means a lot to you?
AMY YANG:   Means a lot, yes.

Q.   Stacey came over and she congratulated you.   What did she say? 
AMY YANG:   Yeah, she says, Congratulations.   Well‑played.   I said, Thank you.

Q.   It's tough to battle Stacy, isn't it?
AMY YANG:   Oh, yeah.   She's a great player.   She's top player.

Q.   No. 2. 
AMY YANG:   Former No. 1.

Q.   Yep.   Last question.   That swing on 15, talk about that a little bit.   Is that when you thought, I have a real good chance to win?
AMY YANG:   15, the par‑4, I just want to make sure I set ball up on the ridge.   That's all I was thinking.

Q.   Afterwards did you think, I have a chance to win this tournament?
AMY YANG:   I still didn't want to decide that because we had three more holes to go and they're not easy.
So I just kept focusing.
