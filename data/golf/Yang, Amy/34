 Q.  Thoughts about your second round play overall?  
AMY YANG: You know, I wasn't hitting as solid as like yesterday, last round.  But I stayed patient out there.  I did my best.  You know, I believe it's still there.  So I'm looking forward to play on the weekends, yeah.   
 Q.  Even though you were second round, kind of around the lead all around, is leaderboard watching something you do or just focus on your game plan?  
AMY YANG: No, just focus on game plan.  Just be patient out there and like stay in the present and do your best.  Yeah, that's just my game plan.   
 Q.  You're a world-class player but you've contended in majors before.  How do those experiences help you going into this weekend?  
AMY YANG: You know, I've had a lot of experience playing in final groups, and you know, I know what to do.  Just do the same thing.  Just focus on your game.  I think that's all.   
 Q.  What would cause you to change your game plan?  Would you ever do that?  
AMY YANG: No, it's just stay the same.   
 Q.  Are you glad to be done before that?  
AMY YANG: Honestly, yes (laughing).  We had a rain stop yesterday.  I had to come back and play, finish the 18th hole.  Glad I'm finished.   
 Q.  Did that birdie this morning kind of set up the round, the second round?  
AMY YANG: It was a good birdie.  But I don't know, I just couldn't continue that good momentum on the second round.  But it's still there.  I'm playing good.  It's good.
