Q. After two rounds of 71, you finally clicked into gear and shot a 6-under today.  What worked out there for you today?
AMY YANG: My putting was really good.  Shots have been nice from last week, even Thursday and Friday, but I just couldn't make some putts out there.  But today, I made a bunch of birdies out there.  It was good.
Q. It was a slow start for you today.  Did you think it was going to be just another one of those grinding days at the beginning?
AMY YANG: You know what, that didn't feel good, starting with bogey.  But you know, always you try to be positive out there, so stay patient.  You know, I think that worked out.
Q. Can you tell us what happened out there on the eighth hole?  Did you come back after the rain delay?
AMY YANG: The horn blew right after I hit the second shot and went into a drain.  I got free relief from there but it was a tough shot, underneath the tree.  I had to grip down my wedge and punch out.  But I hit the cart path, came back to the drain again, so get another drop, two putts.
Q. So an up-and-down day, overall, quite happy with yourself?
AMY YANG: You know, yeah, yeah, and -- yeah, it was good.  I'm really looking forward to the next round, final round, and looking for another good one tomorrow.
