Q. So, 14th top-10 finish in a major.  Do you take that, positives out of that, that you're getting close?
AMY YANG: Yes.  I never count it before, but the 14 top-10 finishes for a major is a huge thing.  Just can't do it often, so I'll take it I'm getting better, playing good every year.
Q. I don't know if this is a constellation prize for you, but it looks like you sealed that Olympic berth?
AMY YANG: Yeah, looks like it, am I making the team?  Oh, okay.  That's amazing.  I'm very honored to be a part of Team Korea, and I'm looking forward to it, yeah.
Q. How much did you think about it this week?
AMY YANG: This week?  About making the team?  I mean, I told everybody just -- I'm just, you know, relaxing about making team.  But I thought about it, you know.  I'm so happy I made it to the team.
Q. You told everyone you were relaxing, but what was really going on inside?  Was it different inside?
AMY YANG: Fighting, like one side you want it, and the other side, just let the stress go.  So, that's good.
Q. Have you let yourself imagine what it would be like to be in Rio representing Korea?
AMY YANG: No, I haven't.  But I was so focused on making it.
Q. How big is it for Korea to be an Olympian?
AMY YANG: Golf is very big in Korea.  To make it in the Olympic team is a huge thing, you know.  I think it would be same for any other countries, too.
Q. But your race was really tight.  It was really a strong race for Koreans more than any other country?
AMY YANG: Yeah, it was.  It was.  There was many, many great players around.  And I can't think of it, I'm just happy to make it.
