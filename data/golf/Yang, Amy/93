 Q. If you could talk about your round from the second hole. 
 AMY YANG: Second hole, I hit a good tee shot, but the second shot wasn't good. It was into the wind. 
 I was trying to knock it down, but it was really difficult into the bunker. But that bunker has a lot of sand, so I had it like really short of it. So I had a two-putt bogey there.

 Q. And then you had a run from the fourth. 
 AMY YANG: Oh, yeah. No. 4, how did I play there? 

 Q. You got 2 on the par-3. 
 AMY YANG: I don't remember how I played. 

 Q. Good. You played good. Let's go through the bag today, birdies and bogeys. 
 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: 4 was the 5-iron she hit in there real well on the par-3. You hit that about five feet. Remember? Well, that's good you don't remember this stuff. 
 And then you chipped in on the bunker in 5. 
 AMY YANG: Yeah. Chipped in on 5. 
 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was out of the bunker. Greenside bunker. And then 6, you (inaudible)
 AMY YANG: I had a good tee and good chip shot on 8. 

 Q. And then you (inaudible) on the 18th?
 AMY YANG: Yeah. A tee shot, I hit it good, but the wind took it to the right side. But rough wasn't bad. I hit a 4-iron really good over the green. Just chipped in.

 Q. And how are you finding -- how many times have you played Links golf or how are you finding it?
 AMY YANG: Here or the Links golf? 

 Q. Links golf. 
 AMY YANG: I really like it. It's windy and raining hard, but I like it. 

 Q. You like the challenge of playing in the wind?
 AMY YANG: Yeah.

 Q. You actually played quite well last year in the Wales Championships. 
 AMY YANG: Oh, yeah. 

 Q. That was on Links golf. 
 AMY YANG: I think this is more like Links.

 Q. Yeah. So this is a little bit different. You also played very well in windy conditions. So you're not scared to play in wind?
 AMY YANG: Only a few times I've played good. 

 Q. Oh, is that right? But today you played well in it. 
 AMY YANG: Yeah. I just test it, like the game and the thoughts are the same, but playing safely. I'm just going to go like try to do the same thing tomorrow, the next three days.

 Q. It was the same at the U.S. Open, a boost to your confidence?
 AMY YANG: Yeah. Actually, it was really good experience. First time being in a finish like on the fifth of a tournament.

 Q. And you're feeling more comfortable on the LPGA this year? Your results better?
 AMY YANG: Yeah. It's better than last year.

 Q. And you feel happier on the Tour do you?
 AMY YANG: Yeah.

 Q. And what do you like most about being in England?
 AMY YANG: I don't know. I haven't been around here much, you know. I think, you know, every time I come here, because I haven't been outside much, but from the golf, it's actually, you know, different conditions, more difficult. I think giving me more experience.

 Q. So you like the challenge of playing in the wind?
 AMY YANG: Yeah.

 Q. Well, good luck to you. 
 AMY YANG: Thank you.
