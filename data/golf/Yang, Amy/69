Q.   Amy Yang, 1‑under par today, one shot shy of the lead.   It was a tough slog out there, wasn't it?   What were conditions like today compared to yesterday?
AMY YANG:   I think pin position was a lot tougher today.   Yeah. 
Other things, they were okay, but pin position was really tough.

Q.   Was the wind a factor with the game today?
AMY YANG:   Oh, yes.   It was windy as well, so it was hard to go for the pin.   And also tough pin positions, so it was a long day.

Q.   It was indeed a very long day.   Not many people scored low.   4‑under was the lowest I believe.   But you do go into the final round one shot back of the lead.   What will your strategy be like tomorrow?
AMY YANG:   I'll just do my best one shot at a time.   I won't think about too much.   I am going to go to the range and work on some of my swing right now and putting a little bit and get ready to go. 

Q.   Tell us a little bit about the end of the season last year.   You finished up quite early, didn't you?
AMY YANG:   Yeah.

Q.   Why was that?
AMY YANG:   You know, sometimes you get tired of what you're doing.   I think I that happened to me.   But, how can I say, got much better so I came back.

Q.   Feeling a lot refreshed, I believe. 
AMY YANG:   Yeah.
