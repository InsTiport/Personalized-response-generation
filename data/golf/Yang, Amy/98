 Q. Playing with a South Korean player, do you know Kim very well? 
 AMY YANG: Yeah, I know her very well. Through this season I have seen her every week when we play in tournaments, yeah. 

 Q. What is she like? 
 AMY YANG: She's a really nice girl. When I see her, every time, she's always smiling and I think her mind, she's a positive girl. I really like her, yeah. 

 Q. How is the course playing today compared to yesterday?
 AMY YANG: I guess yesterday was more harder conditions. It was more windier but I think it's pretty much the same. The greens are all fast and hard. It's hard to control. 

 Q. The Koreans are dominating in golf; what is the secret?

 Q. How do you feel about your year on the LPGA? You came very close to winning; right? 
 AMY YANG: You know, my year has been okay for me. It's okay for me. First, starting up the year, I wasn't really, you know, playing well. But it's getting better, better every week. I feel good. I like it. 

 Q. Are you feeling like you're playing well at the moment? 
 AMY YANG: Not yet. I guess I need more experience and more practise. 

 Q. Do you think you are on top of your game at the moment? Is there anything else you need to work on?
 AMY YANG: I need to work hard more.

 Q. Which areas? Which part of your game are you hoping to improve?
