Q. What did you learn about that golf course that helped you out there today?
AMY YANG: I mean, today I hit a lot of good, solid shots, but I made many good putts out there, especially on back nine.
You know, didn't make many huge mistakes out there.  Bogey-free.  Happy how I played today.
Q. You have such a beautifully, fluid swing.  Is that something that you keep working on?
AMY YANG: Yeah, just last two years I been working with new coach.  Still working on it.
But my swing is getting better.  Yeah, it's going well.
Q. Your swing looks about the same to us as ten years ago.  Absolutely gorgeous.  What are you looking forward to going into this weekend?  No cut.
AMY YANG: Next two rounds it's so important hit fairways first and just keep doing what I been doing:  just not thinking too much out there.  Just try to go low, you know.  Do my best.
