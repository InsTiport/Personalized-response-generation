AMY YANG: I putted really good today.  So many excellent putts, and very good speed.  I made.   
 Q.  Tell us about the conditions today.  You seem to enjoy playing in southeast Asia.  What is it about these conditions that makes you thrive?  
AMY YANG: I don't know why, but I do enjoy Southeast Asia.  I'd rather play in this weather than cold weather.  There's a lot of stuff to do around.  That's it, yeah.   
 Q.  Tell us about the last four holes?  
AMY YANG: The last four holes, I hit it really solid, close to the pin.  Like all day, my putting was good.  Just happy to shoot a bogey-free round.   
 Q.  And game plan for tomorrow?  
AMY YANG: You know, simple, just keep it simple.  And weather is hot out there, so try to get as much shade as I can.   
I hit a lot of solid shots today and putting was really good.   
 Q.  You're only one shy of your personal best, a 62?  
AMY YANG: I didn't think of it.  I just focused on one shot at a time, just keep it simple out there and had a great day.   
 Q.  Are you aware that last week, you crossed the million dollar mark in season earnings?  
AMY YANG: First time, I didn't know that.   
 Q.  On the Asian Swing, you've had a couple of runner-up finishes.  Are you thinking that you've got a win in the bag and you're keen on wanting to give yourself a chance?  
AMY YANG: A lot of golf to play the next three days, so just going to keep being simple.   
 Q.  It was hot out there; are you little bit tired?  It doesn't show in the score today.  
AMY YANG: I was a little bit this morning, but when I get to the tee, I just decided to play.
