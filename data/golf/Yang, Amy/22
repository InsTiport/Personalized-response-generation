 Q.  Congratulations on a great week, first of all.  
AMY YANG: Thank you.   
 Q.  What was it like watching golf history?  
AMY YANG: Oh, wow, that was amazing.  She shot 7-under par today without any bogey, bogey-free round.  It was amazing out there watching her.   
It was great.   
 Q.  Just talk about your game this week.  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I played really good this week.  I'll take positive this week.  I'm getting better.   
And still I made mistake on the finishing back nine, but it's okay.  No problem.  I'm getting better.   
 Q.  Was that on 15?  Tried to reach it in two?  
AMY YANG: No.  My tee shot went in the water.  Yeah, so I was -- (laughter.)  Bad break, but it's okay.  Yeah.   
 Q.  You said you were going to build some confidence from this week.  What else do you take away from your performance?  
AMY YANG: What else?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
AMY YANG: Good positive thinking.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Anything in particular like with your swing or anything like that?  
AMY YANG: I was hitting really solid this week.  This is my six week and usually when the weeks go more longer you get tired; your swing might feel not so great.   
I was actually maybe the best week I was hitting out there this week.  Putting was good.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Are you going to play next week, too?  
AMY YANG: No, no.   
 Q.  So six.  Is that the longest?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I think so.  This is the longest I ever done.   
 Q.  Ever?  
AMY YANG: Ever.  I think so.  I'm not sure.  I might not remember.   
 Q.  But it feels that way.  
AMY YANG: (Laughter.)
