Q. So you put yourself in second all alone.
AMY YANG: Yes.
Q. Playing in the final group tomorrow.  How are you looking forward to that?
AMY YANG: You know, will be a little nervous.  It's been a while playing in the final group.  But I'm playing good.  I'm hitting the ball solid.  I'm rolling the putts really good.
I'm really looking forward to play.
Q. Do you recall the last time you were in the final group, where that would've been?
AMY YANG: I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't remember.
Q. Going to be eight, maybe nine shots.  Can you just go play relaxed with that kind of spread?
AMY YANG: I'm just going to do my best out there.  You know, what can you do except that?  As I said, I'm hitting good, putting good, so just going to be patient out there and do my best.
Q. You played with In Gee today.
AMY YANG: Uh-huh.
Q. Probably play with Sei Young tomorrow.
AMY YANG: Uh-huh.
Q. Fun playing with some of your friends?
AMY YANG: I like it, yeah.  I like both of them, and even today with In Gee we talked a lot of the things on the course.  I had fun with her, yeah.
Q. What do you think that you've done really well this week?
AMY YANG: This week?
Q. Yeah.
AMY YANG: I guess putting was the key.  Putting really good.  Feel good about my putting this week.
I think that was the key.
Q. Do you have any expectations or anything?  Do you expect to play well tomorrow?
AMY YANG: You know, I'll do my best to play, but, you know, I'm just going to lower my expectation out there tomorrow.  Just one shot at a time and do my best.
Q. Does a week like this give you a lot of confidence in your game?
AMY YANG: Yes, of course, of course.  Like I say before, it's been a while playing in contention area.  I see myself improving, so I take the positive.
