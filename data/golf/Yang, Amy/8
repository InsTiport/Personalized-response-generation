Q. So a fantastic final round for you out here in L.A. What was so comfortable for you out there?
AMY YANG: You know, I was playing so good today.  A lot of putts I hit it so solid.  I was swinging better out there.  Everything went well, yeah.
Q. What improvements did you make between the first couple rounds to this round to put you in the position you are?
AMY YANG: I think my swing rhythm was much better towards the end, so I think that's why I could have a lot of solid shots out there.
Q. Did you notice your swing rhythm was a little bit off or did you come out yesterday and realize that was one of the changes you needed to make?
AMY YANG: I didn't know, but my caddie told me on the range, you know, looked a little bit off rhythm.  We been working on last couple of days and it went well.
Q. So how are you going to take this momentum that you had today into the next tournament?
AMY YANG: Just going to keep work on same thing, keep good rhythm and working on some short game and putting for next week.
