Q. You are currently tied for third place, 4-under for the day, much different play than yesterday.  What was it like out there for your final round?
AMY YANG: You know, I just tried to do what I could out there.  I did my best.  It started raining like just after nine holes.  I really tried to be patient out there, and yeah, I did it good.
Q. What made the difference for you compared to yesterday, and what did you do to help rally today?
AMY YANG: I wasn't hitting it very good yesterday, last round, and putting was so bad.  I just had a tough time yesterday, and it was better today.
Q. Do you think it was the weather conditions, or was it just kind of your own game?
AMY YANG: I would say I think it's more my own game.  Just sometimes golf is totally different.  It was that kind of day.
Q. You've been playing great back-to-back weeks.  At this point in the season, what has made the difference for you compared to the beginning of the year to now?  How do you think your game has developed?
AMY YANG: You know, it's improving a lot.  First of all, I think I'm hitting it much better after my elbow injury, and also putting is working well together, and I think that was the biggest key to improvement.
Q. We have one more major left; what are you going to do to prepare?
AMY YANG: Just going to really work on some short game and putting, and I'm really looking forward to playing.
