Q. You finished with the birdie at the last?
AMY YANG: You know, it was tough today.  It rained a lot in on the front nine.  I just try to stay hang in there and just kept grinding.  And the birdie on the last hole feels really good.  It's going to make dinner tasty.
Q. What do you tell yourself on a tough day like that to stay in the moment, stay motivated?
AMY YANG: The most important is patience.  It's playing tough.  It played -- it was a different golf course out there today.  It played much longer.  Just keep trying, you know.  Never get mad, just be patient out there, yeah.
Q. You have been in contention in so many majors.  What have you learned from those experiences that can help you here this week?
AMY YANG: I think, again, it's patience and believing in yourself, playing in the contention.
Q. How do you feel about where you are heading into the weekend?
AMY YANG: I like where I am positioned right now.  I'm really looking forward to play the weekend.  I'm hitting good and I'm putting good and I'm feeling good about my game right now.
