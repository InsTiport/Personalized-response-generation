 Q.  Clubhouse leader; can you tell us about your round today?  
AMY YANG: You know, my putting was really good today.  I was hitting it pretty solid out there, but I gave myself a lot of good chances, and I think I made most of them out there.  Yeah, that was really helpful.   
 Q.  How much did the wind come in as a factor, especially in the later holes?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, it was definitely -- it was difficult.  I would say I got lucky on when I teed off this morning.   
 Q.  Was it more difficult than it's been?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, definitely, especially coming like the last three holes, a lot of into the wind or really strong left to right, and the hazard on the side definitely wasn't easy.   
 Q.  Have you faced winds like this before?  
AMY YANG: Yes.  We just played over in Scotland in the British Open, so we are pretty used to this weather, yeah.   
 Q.  Feeling confident about your game coming in here?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, I've been hitting it very solid the last few weeks and also putting well, so I just need a little more to play better, yeah.   
 Q.  How are you feeling about the crowds here?  
AMY YANG: Oh, it's amazing.  I was surprised how many people came out already on the weekdays.  So I'm looking forward to seeing them again on the weekend.
