Q. What are your thoughts right now?
AMY YANG: You know, it's been a little disappointing day for me.  I struggled putting a little bit but overall, I had a good week.  I played solid golf this week, so I'll take the positive to next week.
Q. I guess the course is playing so much differently than it was yesterday, and then it's playing so much differently from the day before.  So was it just a question of trying to adjust to how the course was playing, with no wind and obviously more rain?
AMY YANG: Yeah, rain makes a little softer course out there but it was mostly I had a hard time making good putting speed on the green.  But you know, still did a good job this week.
