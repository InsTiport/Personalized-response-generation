 Q. Basically, when you're playing with somebody who is charging towards the top of the leaderboard, how does that affect your play?AMY YANG: It was a good game, we were both good friends, Michelle and Catriona, and I just felt I just did what I need to do and I enjoyed the game.
Q. How did you play?  How was your round today?AMY YANG: I played solid today.  I started with two bogeys, a little shaky, but got my feeling back on the back nine and I was putting it good, hitting it pretty solid, it was a good round.
Q. What kind of impact did this course have on your game?  What were you able to do, what were you not able to do out here?AMY YANG: I think the toughest part is the greens.  The greens are really slopey and they look like that they are like turtlebacks.  So it's really hard to go for the pins.  Like, I always have to go for the safest spot, so I can get a good putt.
Q. What do you think Michelle, first of all, Michelle needs to do to stay on the top?AMY YANG: She's doing it good.  If she just keeps doing what she's doing, she's going to play good.
Q. Where did you finish?AMY YANG: Total of even for the tournament.
Q. So you're not out of this by any stretch of the imagination.  You're within striking distance.AMY YANG: Yeah.
Q. What about your own chances of winning?AMY YANG: My own chances?  I'm playing pretty solid right now.  I'm feeling good.  I think I can finish well this week.
Q. What will it take for you to win?AMY YANG: Be patient.  This kind of a tough course, you need to really be patient.
Q. How has your patience been?  Has it been good?AMY YANG: It's been good.  Yeah, I'm really happy about my game right now and I'm happy how I played the last two rounds.
