 Q.  What a way to finish off there at 18, but spectacular rounds for you here.  What is it about this course now couple rounds in that you feel like you're getting your groove together here?  
AMY YANG: You know, I was putting much better today.  I started off hitting so solid.  Gave myself lot of good chances on Thursday, and then Friday I still did, I hit so many good shots, but didn't make putts well.   
Today both hitting and the putting was working so well so I could shoot another 64.   
 Q.  I was going to say, this is moving day for a reason.  Do you think you took full advantage of it?  
AMY YANG: What does that mean?  I'm sorry.   
 Q.  Just the fact that you shot up the leaderboard now.  You're sitting pretty high up there on a course that does go low.  Do you think you got the most out of the course today?  
AMY YANG: Oh, yeah, definitely.  Had a really solid round today.  Can't be happier than this, yeah.   
 Q.  Coming off a T11 finish at Arkansas; since the U.S. Open Women's Open, your last missed cut, you kind of been on fire lately here.  What do you think has been the most improved part of your game lately?  
AMY YANG: I think it's more maybe mental game.  Yeah, I really wanted to play well U.S. Open but missed cut.  Oh, well.  Let it go.  Just try to be patient like every day.  Come out with good patience and just fresh mind.   
 Q.  What do you think it's going to take to get your second win of the season here?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, definitely, you know, golf is not like a short sport.  We play five hours.  You got to be really patient out there and just keep hitting some fairways and greens, and if I can make more putts, you know, I think I will have chance, yeah.
