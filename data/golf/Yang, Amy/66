Q. Talk about your round?AMY YANG: I drove really well today.  I missed a couple of drive to the left into the rough.  But most all day I hit it really good.  And I also putted fairly good today.Q. Do you feel like the back nine played a little easier than expected?AMY YANG: You know, it was -- no, I don't think so.  It was a lot softer this morning, that's why we played a little easier, we go for the pin and stuff like that.Q. The 8th hole, harder par-3?AMY YANG: Yeah, it's a hard hole.  I don't know, this morning the greens were a little softer and slower, so I left my putt really short to three-putt it.Q. What did you hit?AMY YANG: 5-iron.Q. You played pretty well in the practice round.  But with the rain this morning, did it make it even slower?AMY YANG: No, nothing different, just maybe I was a little bit more aggressive hitting to the green, near to the pin.  And just knowing that the green is going to be soft and slow.Q. Can you tell us about the state of your game coming in?  How confident have you been in your game?  Where are you at with your game?AMY YANG: I've been working with my new coach, Tony, and we've been working on the swing.  And it helped really improve a lot.  And I understand really well my swing.  And we prepared well for this tournament.  So I feel good about this week.Q. Coming in with the confidence to win here?AMY YANG: You know, we prepared well.  So I think I could do well this week, yeah.
