 Q.  How did it feel to come out and make a birdie to put yourself in the lead for round one?  
AMY YANG: You know, I'm hitting the ball very solid lately, and making some putts, too.  It's good.  I've been always looking for this round of golf and it's going really well.  Feel pretty good about how I played yesterday and finished with a birdie today.  Just looking forward to play.   
 Q.  Could you already tell the difference between the conditions yesterday versus this morning, just having played half a hole?  
AMY YANG: Just more softer, just because of the rain last night.  I've only seen like half a hole, because you have a lot of moisture.  Won't be hard as last round.   
 Q.  Did you get a lot of confidence from your last week in Arkansas?  
AMY YANG: Yes, I did.  It's been a while.  I've had some little like -- shaky lately.  I needed a tournament that I can do it.  That was a tournament that gave me a lot of confidence.  Yeah, doing good.   
 Q.  Your eagle, what did you have there?  
AMY YANG: It was 192 to the pin, and it was blowing downwind.  I tried to play an 80 shot and it landed like seven, eight yards before, and it rolled in.   
 Q.  Was it difficult going to sleep knowing you had one hole to finish?  
AMY YANG: No, that early alarm makes me do that.
