   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have another player who is in at 1-under par, 70, Amy Yang. She is 20 years old. She's a native of Korea, but she lives in Australia.   
 AMY YANG: No.  
 MODERATOR: That's what it says here.   
 AMY YANG: That's wrong. (Laughter.)  
 MODERATOR: It says Robina, Australia.   
 AMY YANG: Oh, yeah, but I left there.  
 MODERATOR: You lived there while you were in high school. Where do you live now?   
 AMY YANG: I live in Orlando, Florida.  
 MODERATOR: Okay. So you moved. Now, this is your fourth Women's Open, and last year you tied for -- let's see, you were tied for 27th, I believe. Very good. All right.   
 Amy, tell us a little bit about your round. Did you start at the front or the back?   
 AMY YANG: Started from the first hole.  
 MODERATOR: On the front nine?   
 AMY YANG: Front nine, but I start with 6.   
 MODERATOR: Double bogey on the first hole. That's a tough way to begin. How did that happen?   
 AMY YANG: I was just a bit nervous on the tee box. You know, hit the 3-wood shot a little left, a little draw shot. It kicked into the bunker, just front of the bunker. So my right foot was in the bunker, and I couldn't go for the green to lay up.   
 I laid up really good, but the third shot, like about 68 yards downhill, I hit it little tough, went over the green, and just did a lot of things there.  
 MODERATOR: Uh-oh. You chipped back on and two-putted?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah.   
 MODERATOR: Then you bogeyed No. 3.   
 AMY YANG: Yeah.  
 MODERATOR: You're 3 over after three holes, wow. But then let's go to the birdies. No. 4 you birdied. How long was your putt?   
 AMY YANG: Actually, my driver shot went right side into the bunker, so I had to lay up with the 58-degree, because, you know, bunker is really deep. And I had like, I guess about like 180 yards to the green.   
 I had 6-iron landing short of the green, and it ended up like four feet was perfect shot.  
 MODERATOR: Then the most exciting hole has to be -- well, you bogeyed -- you parred No. 8. You eagled No. 9. All right. What did you hit to the green there?   
 AMY YANG: Rescue, like rescue shots aimed just in front of the bunker, like left of it, which is like, I guess, like 10 yards right of the flag. But I pulled it a little bit, and actually it started to the flag and ended up really good, like four feet.  
 MODERATOR: Four feet for an eagle 3. Terrific. Then you birdied No. 11. How long was that putt?   
 AMY YANG: Um, six -- no. I don't remember.   
 MODERATOR: No. 11 is par-4.   
 AMY YANG: Yeah, six steps.   
 MODERATOR: So that's what, about?   
 AMY YANG: I don't know.  
 MODERATOR: 15 feet or so?   
 AMY YANG: Might be.   
 MODERATOR: No. 15 you bogeyed. What happened there?   
 AMY YANG: I was on the green, but just front of the green right side. Had like really, really long putt and just hit it too short. Three-putted.  
 MODERATOR: Then you birdied 18.   
 AMY YANG: Yeah.   
 MODERATOR: How did you do that?   
 AMY YANG: Um, had really good driver shot down on right side of fairway and hit pitching wedge, about 130. It was like six feet away.   
 MODERATOR: So your birdie putts were mostly short ones that you made today. You were hitting the ball close to the hole.   
 AMY YANG: Yeah. I mean, it's so hard to make putts on that green, on the Oakmont green. It's really a lot of things.   
 MODERATOR: How much did you practice here this week? Did you come in early?   
 AMY YANG: No, I got here Sunday night and started practicing on Monday morning. Just like other players.   
 MODERATOR: How do you like your position? You're tied for the lead. Do you play well when you're in the lead of a tournament, or would you rather kind of be hiding back a little bit and come from behind?   
 AMY YANG: I don't know. I never been on the leader, like on the LPGA Tour yet.   
 MODERATOR: Ever?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah. I think it's like first time. So little nervous but, no.   
 MODERATOR: How does it feel for the first time?   
 AMY YANG: It feels good.   
 MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. You mentioned the severe bunkering here. Just night and day difference from regular tournaments on the tour. Could you talk a little about how much more severe they are?  
 AMY YANG: They're just -- it's so deep. I mean, if you go in there you can't go for the green. I always have to go to sideway with the short wedge.   
 Yeah, it's just all deep here.   
  
  Q. Do you like firm and fast conditions like this week, and do you normally play well on those? What are your favorite conditions?  
 AMY YANG: Um, yeah, I like fast greens, but this is way faster than I like, you know. You know, I'm trying to be patient all week.   
 MODERATOR: I'm interested in how you got to Australia to go to school.   
 AMY YANG: I don't know. That was my dad decision to go there. I don't know why. It's just his decision.  
 MODERATOR: How long did you live in Australia?   
 AMY YANG: I lived there three years.  
 MODERATOR: Were you playing golf at the time?   
 AMY YANG: Yep.  
 MODERATOR: And you had good practice facilities?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah, yeah, it's really nice there.  
 MODERATOR: Did you have a coach there?   
 AMY YANG: Yep.  
 MODERATOR: Who was that?   
 AMY YANG: It was few coaches, but last coach was David Neville.   
 MODERATOR: How did you decide to come to Orlando?   
 AMY YANG: To play in the LPGA Tour.   
 MODERATOR: So that was a good place to live and fly out of?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah. I started playing on the European Tour first, so it was easy to fly from Orlando to Europe. And if I have tournament, LA, like Orlando to LA, it's kind of middle.  
 MODERATOR: Kind of in the middle, so easy to commute to Europe.   
 AMY YANG: Yeah.  
 MODERATOR: Does any of your family live near you?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah, yeah. Mom and dad here with me, and brother also going to high school in Orlando. Yeah, whole family are living here.  
 MODERATOR: Are they up here for this championship?   
 AMY YANG: Yeah, they're here this week.   
 MODERATOR: You have good support.
