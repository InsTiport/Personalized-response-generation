Q.   Just talk us through your round a little bit.   Just give us a recap. 
AMY YANG:   You know, I think I had good round today.   1‑under par.   It was very tough out there.   I tried my best.   Yeah, it was a fun day.

Q.   And how was it out there playing?   You know, the crowds were a little bit bigger today.   How was it out there?
AMY YANG:   Very exciting to play in a lot of people. 

Q.   14 years after Se Ri won here to have Korean players finish first and second, what does that mean to you?
AMY YANG:   You know, could you rephrase it, please.

Q.   Yeah.   Is it kind of a special moment that a Korean player finished first and second 14 years after Se Ri won here?
AMY YANG:   Yeah, it is.   It is very special and very ‑‑ it's ‑‑ yeah. 

Q.   You got within a couple of shots.   You had a small window there to get close, but then she just kind of pulled away from you. 
AMY YANG:   I knew she was going to play well.   She's very consistent player. 

Q.   What are you going to take away from this week?   You played in the last group?   Just what are you going to take away from it?
AMY YANG:   Well, I learned a lot.   It gives me a lot of confidence that I came in second this week.   My game is feeling pretty good and I'm going to keep trying hard.

Q.   Is there some pride in it that the U.S. Open Championship goes back to Korea again?   Is there some country pride in that, I guess?
AMY YANG:   I guess. 

Q.   I guess you would have thought it would have been you; right, instead of Na Yeon Choi up there?   You would have rather seen yourself up there rather than Na Yeon, correct?   But is it still good that it's going back to Korea?
AMY YANG:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I think so.   Yeah.
