 Q.   Amy, a lovely round, and what a super eagle you had on 7.   Tell us about that hole.   
AMY YANG:   Yeah, I had great driver left side of fairway and I had a good angle to go for the green, around 110 front of the green.  
Yeah, I made it in two and made an eagle putt.  
   
 Q.   You're one of the longer hitters out here this week, so I imagine you can really take advantage of the par‑5s.   
AMY YANG:   Yeah, most par‑5s are reachable, so if I can put my ball in the right position I can go for the green.  
   
 Q.   You must be brimmed full of confidence.   Second last week in Australia; feeling good ‑ and hot ‑ here in Thailand.   
AMY YANG:   Yeah, already had hot weather last week so I'm used to it.   Try to stay under the umbrella as much as possible to stay cool.
