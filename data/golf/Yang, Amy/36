Q. What a magical round you have had.  How good is that feeling walking up the 18th hole knowing you have it in the bag?
AMY YANG: You know, very happy, beyond happy.  Wasn't easy with rain delays and 4:00 a.m. wake-up calls two days in a row.
But, you know, I stayed really patient out there, did my best, and very happy to win the tournament.
Q. It's your third win.  How crucial was the putt on 14 to save par?  We saw you breathe a sigh of relief after holing that putt.
AMY YANG: Yeah, that chip wasn't easy from the bottom.  I had little forward bounce.  I feel like I had to make it.
Yeah, and I did.  (Laughter.)
Q. You certainly did.  This is a wonderful win for you.  How good are you in this tournament?  You've played eight times and won it twice.  How lovely is it to have your parents here?
AMY YANG: It's always nice to be back here playing.  I love this place.  I love people here.  And with my parents, spending time with them here, it's just great every time.
Q. There will a good challenge from the field.  So Yeon Ryu played very well.
AMY YANG: Yeah, she's a great player.  She is one of the best player in Korea and I always enjoy playing with her.
Q. How tremendous.  Three wins you have in your career and a great start to 2017.
AMY YANG: Really looking forward to play the season, yeah.
