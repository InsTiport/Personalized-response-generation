 Q.  First of all, talk about your week as a whole.  Your play this week and the course overall and your play?  
AMY YANG: Like overall this week, I played pretty good all week.  Today was a little tough.  Just a little bit of mistakes here and there.  I didn't make many birdies out there.   
I had fun this week.  It was good.   
 Q.  What about the golf course.  Did it change a lot after the rain?  Was today firmer than yesterday?  
AMY YANG: Maybe dried a little bit, but it was still pretty soft out there with the rain.
