 Q.  Well played today in tough conditions with the wind, 5-under, how did you do it?  
AMY YANG: The course was a lot drier than the last three days of practice.  And also it was windy, much windier out there, and it was swirling from different ways.  But I hit so many solid shots, especially from tee boxes.  Hitting on to the fairways, which is most important thing from the tee box.  So, yeah, just hit it.   
 Q.  You got it running out a little bit, so you had (indiscernible) coming in; is that what you're saying?  
AMY YANG: I mean, rough is so thick out there, so you don't want to hit in there.  So my fairway accuracy was much -- it was really good.  I hit it so solid from tee box every time.  So I think that gave me big advantage shooting lower score today.   
 Q.  When we talked before, you said you were going to take last week off and work with your instructor.  What things did you work on coming into this week?  
AMY YANG: Just simple things.  I have like tendency using too much my wrist, hitting it through the ball.  So I have a little bit of tendency hitting it stronger draw out there.  So we worked on it, and it's helping really good.   
 Q.  Did you follow at all what was happening here this morning, were you surprised to see Mirim go so low?  
AMY YANG: I didn't know until I went out there on the course and I saw the leaderboard.  Mirim shot 63, right?  Oh, 64?  So it was good to see.   
 Q.  Are you still working with Tony?  
AMY YANG: Yes, he's here this week.   
 Q.  Is that good to have your teacher here?  I know he wasn't at Lancashire last year.  
AMY YANG: Yeah, he only came like few days earlier.  This year he decided to stay whole week.  And it is helpful, you know, just sometimes, just one little thing you want to work on, it makes big difference.   
 Q.  You keep knocking on the door on to tournament, one day it will be yours?  
AMY YANG: I'll keep trying.  I like to come and play the U.S. Open, so I'll try.   
 Q.  You had the best round of the afternoon.  This morning the scores were lower.  (Inaudible) hopefully better conditions?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, hopefully better conditions, but depends how they set up out there tomorrow.  And then just try to do same things.   
 Q.  Does it make you think about being more aggressive, maybe?  
AMY YANG: What do you mean?   
 Q.  Does the possibility of the setup being harder tomorrow, does that make you think about probably being more aggressive?  
AMY YANG: No, I'm not try to play too aggressive out here because the course setup is hard.  It's getting drier every day.  So my goal is to -- not to make many mistakes throughout the week.   
 Q.  Do you think of it as more of a long haul than a short sprint?  You're not worried about the small steps, you're looking at the end, you want to get -- you're not thinking about another low score tomorrow, you say just don't take too many chances?  
AMY YANG: Yeah.
