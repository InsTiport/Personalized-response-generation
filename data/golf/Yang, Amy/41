 Q.  Wonderful opening round, but drawing on some of the memories from your win here a couple years ago?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, you know, it was nice to be back again.  I love coming to Thailand to play.  I was hitting it pretty good out there.   
In the middle, during the round, you know, I had some time I couldn't control the ball, but I still had a lot of good shots.  Gave myself a lot of good opportunities out there.   
Just enjoying so much out here.   
 Q.  And supper will taste even better finishing birdie, birdie.  
AMY YANG: Yeah, last couple of holes I was hitting it so solid.  I was aiming at the pin and it was going right at the pin, you know.   
I actually had tough third shot.  I have to chip it from the green.  Fairway was a lot in my line so I had to chip (indiscernible).  Good experience, yeah.   
 Q.  Yeah, and not often you take an 8-iron onto the green, but it was a wonderful up and down, a very strong start to your campaign.  Well-played.  
AMY YANG: Thank you.
