Q. Sitting at the top of the leaderboard here at 10-under par, what's been the key to your strong play?
AMY YANG: You know, actually it wasn't the way I wanted to start the front nine.  I had a few really good chances to make some birdie putts, but I missed it.  But I tried to be patient all day.  Yeah, I think it was a good round.  I didn't fall back.  I stayed patient and played, finished good, yeah.
Q. Started off with ten pars in a row and then you made a pretty big eagle.  What was the club you hit and your yardage and how did it feel?
AMY YANG: It was about 125 yards, like helping downwind.  I hit my pitching wedge, just full pitching wedge to the pin and it came off really solid off the face.  It looked like it was going to go really close but it went in.  When the ball disappeared, I went, yay, finally.
Q. And then had a little bit of a rain delay there for about an hour and a half.  What did you do during the rain delay to keep yourself sharp?
AMY YANG: Actually I was getting a little frustrated about, you know, not making putts, and I was getting hungry.  So I went back, ate lunch, and it actually gave me some time to thought about what was going on and think about the next three, how to finish, so it helped, yeah.
Q. You finished strong after the rain delay.  You made a birdie.  How long was the putt that you dropped?
AMY YANG: It was about 20 feet downhill, right-to-left.  I just picked a spot and just trust there and make a solid putt.
Q. Good position heading into the weekend as the leader.  What's going to be the key?
AMY YANG: I think it will be similar to like today.  So you know, golf can be really easy like yesterday, but it can be also a little slow like today.
So I'm just going to be patient, do my best.  I've been practicing hard, so I'm just going to trust what I've been practicing.
