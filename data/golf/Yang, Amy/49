Q. Familiar position, near the top of the lead in the U.S. Women's Open, how does it feel and what is your mindset going into the weekend?
AMY YANG: Just like another day.  Just like yesterday and today.  Not going to think much, just get out there, do my best every hole.
Q. You have a reputation for making birdies in bunches.  You can make eight or nine in a row.  In a U.S. Open that just doesn't happen.  How do you change your thinking for a U.S. Open?
AMY YANG: Sorry?
Q. How do you change your thinking for the U.S. Open?
AMY YANG: Because the course is to challenging out there, I can't just be -- I can't be aggressive every hole.  So I just let go of the pressure, and then the feeling you want to go aggressive, just let it go and do whatever you can out there.
I think I did No. 18 and 1, 2, 3 today, just happened so quick.  I don't know how it happens.
Q. Did you have any long putts on those four birdies in a row?
AMY YANG: Yes, I had about a 35, 36-footer on No. 2, yeah, from left side.  The pin was tucked my side.
Q. Do you pay attention to the leaderboard at all during the round?
AMY YANG: No, no, I don't.
Q. Do you look at it on Sunday?
AMY YANG: Sunday?  Yeah, maybe Sunday.  But I don't really pay attention to it, yeah.
Q. You are one of the few players who played well in the afternoon yesterday.  What was it like compared to yesterday?
AMY YANG: It was less wind and especially front nine and a lot softer.  But wind picked up on No. maybe 11 or 12.  So it was a little tough on back nine.
Q. Yesterday prepared you for that probably?
AMY YANG: Yesterday I hit it, I drove it so good, so I gave myself many opportunities out there.  But today I had some trouble hitting tee shots, hitting into rough and trying to save up and down.  But I finished good.  I did good, yeah.
