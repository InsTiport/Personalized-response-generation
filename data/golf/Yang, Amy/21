 Q.  5-under, early start, but got the best of the conditions, so important to make the most of it?  
AMY YANG: It is.  We had a good tee time, 6.50, and the whole front nine we had no wind at all.  It was nice out there.   
 Q.  Which part of your game were you most happy with?  
AMY YANG: I'm swinging really good.  I hit a lot of balls out there and I hit it close a few times.  You know, also like putting everything well together.  That was the key, chipping.   
 Q.  Some players hate links golf and a lot of players love links golf.  What are your thoughts about links golf?  
AMY YANG: It's definitely like a totally different style.  I do enjoy it.   
 Q.  How much do you play?  
AMY YANG: Once or twice a year.  I do enjoy it and I like to use a lot of imagination out there.  I like it.   
 Q.  When did the wind pick up, on 10?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, like right after front nine.  Just turned on.   
 Q.  And that wind, it's an unusual wind here.  That wind wasn't in practise at all, the direction?  
AMY YANG: All I remember was back nine, I have a lot of into-the-wind holes.  It's tough.   
 Q.  Did you have any of that during the practise rounds this week?  
AMY YANG: Actually, no.  Just actually it was not as windy as today.  We had pretty good weather during the practise round.   
 Q.  What were you most happy with today?  
AMY YANG: I think I stayed focused well out there and be patient.   
 Q.  What was the most pleasing birdie?  
AMY YANG: Actually on the back nine, I had a couple of shots -- 11.   
 Q.  Must have been quite a long second shot on 11?  
AMY YANG: Sorry, maybe ten.   
 Q.  The one with the slope?  
AMY YANG: Yeah, 10 and 15.
