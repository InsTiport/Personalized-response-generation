Q. You had a difficult time today but you finished in good position for the tournament.  Do you take some positive things away?AMY YANG: Yeah, I started a little shaky this afternoon, but I had a good comeback and it was just another good experience, I learned a lot of things again.  It's a good experience.
Q. You've putted so well all week.  Today on the second hole you missed the green and then you 3-putted.  That seemed to be catching.  You 3-putted a couple more times.  What was going on with the putter today?AMY YANG: I don't know, I just had no feeling of the distance.  I just had a tough time all day.  But it's a good lesson and I need to do more work.
Q. What were you and Michelle talking about as you walked up the 18th fairway?AMY YANG: 18?  Just, let's finish strong.
Q. Did you appreciate the drama on 16 when they couldn't find her ball?AMY YANG: What was that?
Q. For about three minutes they couldn't find Michelle's ball.  Were you aware of that and what was going on?AMY YANG: I wasn't thinking anything, I was just worrying about my third shot.  Because I had 50 yards away, so, yeah.
Q. Can you feel kind of the drama and the tension when you're playing with the leader in a U.S. Open?AMY YANG: Not really.
