  Q. Amy, 4 birdies today for a 3-under.  Was there a birdie that stood out today to help propel the round?
 AMY YANG:   You know, I was hitting the ball very solid today and being patient out there and my putting was working so well.  And also I think playing in the morning was helpful for like playing on the poana green.
 Q. Were the nines different a little bit?  Seemed the wind kind of picked up more towards the mid-morning.  Did the nines play a little differently with that wind?
 AMY YANG:   Yeah, wind picked up after nine holes definitely, and, you know, still try to be patient out there and was hitting the ball solid all day, so really didn't feel much difference on the last like few holes.
 Q. I walked the back nine the other day.  I haven't seen all of the front, but it seems like you have to be pretty strategic on the back nine with maybe club selection and ball placement.
 AMY YANG:   Back nine there is like few really difficult holes out there, but try -- all I tried was just try to position on the right spot and just reduce mistakes.
 Q. With the greens playing early was it nice to have that opportunity on these greens?
 AMY YANG:   Yeah, it was much nicer.  And it was getting bumpy on the back nine, but still I think morning wave was helpful for putting.
 Q. We didn't play here obviously last year.  What's the feeling been like to be back at Aviara, to have Kia back on the schedule?
 AMY YANG:   Yeah, it's great to be back.  So happy we're like playing again.
