Q. Awesome job today.
AMY YANG: Thank you.
Q. Great round.  You know this golf well.  You've had success on it twice with two wins.  What was the key to your game today?
AMY YANG: You know, I think I putted really good.  I mean, I made some couple mistakes out there, you know, two-, three-putted, and missed short eagle putt here, but I was putting really good overall, hitting it solid.  Just felt comfortable out there, yeah.
Q. How did you train in the off-season?  What did you do?
AMY YANG: Just I worked on some stuff on my swing, because working with a new coach last year, so been working on my swing and bit of everything, yeah.
Q. Who is your coach.
AMY YANG: Sean Hogan.
Q. Because you were dealing with some injury last year, too, right?
AMY YANG: Yeah.
Q. How is that feeling?  Feeling healthy?
AMY YANG: It's got much better.  Still wearing tape, but just in case.
Q. Preventive?
AMY YANG: Yeah.  But it's not hurting anymore, so it's good.
Q. That's awesome.  So this golf course, you hit an eagle on, was it 5?
AMY YANG: It was on 7, yeah.
Q. Talk us through the eagle.
AMY YANG: So I hit a driver off the tee.  It was a good driver, middle of the fairway; I hit like 200 front, 220 -- around 220 to the pin; hit a 19 rescue.
It went about I would say 21 to 25 feet, and I holed it.  Just was amazing.  (Laughter.)
Q. That's awesome.  How do you enjoy Thailand?
AMY YANG: I like to come here.  It's always nice to come.  I like the golf course.  I like people here.  I like food.  It's been one of my favorite place to come, yeah.
Q. Out of your two wins, maybe what's your best memory?
AMY YANG: Best memory?
Q. From the course or from either of those two years.  What do you remember the most?
AMY YANG: My memory is very short.
Q. Okay, think about that.  Your goals for 2019, what are they?
AMY YANG: You know what?  Actually I have never had more than one win in a year.  I want to break that record this year, yeah.
Q. This week may be the week.  We'll see.
AMY YANG: Thank you.
