 Q.   Amy, 4‑under par 68, just tell me how you played today?  
AMY YANG:   Played really good today.   Had only pars through seven holes, but after that, I made some good shots and good putts.   Overall, a lot of things were working good in the afternoon.   
   
 Q.   So you were even through seven, and then you were 4‑under on the last 11.   Did anything change?   
AMY YANG:   I was hitting the ball better, yeah.   Shot certainly feels better from the eighth hole, and I think that's really helped.   
   
 Q.   You've been really close, playing really well in the last year or so.   Can you just talk about how much you want to win an LPGA event?   
AMY YANG:   Yeah, really want to have my first win on the Tour.   I'm going to keep trying hard.   My game feels good.   I had great year last year.   I have very‑‑ like really good confidence from that.   Looking forward to it.
