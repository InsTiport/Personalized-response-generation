   AMY YANG: It's a great score. I mean, with the delay -- I had pretty good rest yesterday afternoon after about like five-and-a-half holes. I think because of rain the course got a little softer, so I could play a little aggressive today.
 I think it worked out good. 

 Q. Were you aggressive on approaches or aggressive off the tee, too? 
 AMY YANG: Yeah, off the tee, too. It's kind of -- it's not narrow fairway so I could aggressive all the shots, like except putting, like chipping around the green. 

 Q. You think where you're at is probably where you might hold for the weekend, or do you have to continue to shot rounds under par to win this thing and be in contention?
 AMY YANG: Um, I'm not sure. I might have to go a little lower, yeah, to be up there. 

 Q. Have you been in this position before?
 AMY YANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I played good last year U.S. Open, too.

 Q. How much does experience help when you've been in this position before and you come here? How much does that help you as you kind of attack a weekend now?
 AMY YANG: It's a lot of experience. I mean, um... 

 Q. Do you think you're more comfortable?
 AMY YANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes more comfortable then, yeah, first time being in the top.
