Q. 68 on day one here in Canada. Just one bogey today. How would you describe the round?
AMY YANG: You know, I played solid round today. I hit some really good shots out there. Gave myself a lot of good chances. My putting was good also, so had a great day out there. Yeah.
Q. You seem to have a lot of great days here in Canada. Top 5 here last year; this is your 11th appearance. What is it you seem to like so much about playing up here in Canada?
AMY YANG: You know, first of all, I enjoy coming to Canada to play golf. You know, beautiful courses. I really enjoy it. Yep.
Q. Making your first start since the missed cut at the Women's British. What have you been working on to regroup?
AMY YANG: Yeah, been really working on my -- I would say everything. I hit many balls working on shots, and I've been working on my putting as well.
I see it's coming together well, so I think I'm going the right direction. Yeah.
Q. What were some of the specific things you were working on with your swing? Were you making any changes?
AMY YANG: No, not a huge change. You know, just try to get rid of my old habits. Just been working on it. Not something new.
