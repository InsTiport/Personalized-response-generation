 Q. Amy, a terrific round of golf today. What particularly pleased you about your play? 
 AMY YANG: I think for the start, I was still tired from jet-lag and the nine hours of nine time change. So I was just worrying about how I'm going to play, because I wasn't feeling very good this morning but I was just trying to play safe and it worked.

 Q. Certainly it worked. This is a course you've played well on in past. Is it one you particularly enjoy?
 AMY YANG: Yeah, I really like the course. Every time I come here, they always keep it so nice and it's a good golf course. 

 Q. Tomorrow morning you'll play obviously on fresh greens, do you think there's a low score out there for you? 
 AMY YANG: I'll keep trying. 
 Yeah, I still am kind of tired but every day getting better. So I'll keep trying hard. 

 Q. When did you arrive here?
 AMY YANG: Sunday morning. But I'm getting better now. Still waking up early in the morning, like 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock.
