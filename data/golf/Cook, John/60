   JOHN COOK: I attacked both of them. I was prepared for both of them but I just felt the putter was a better play and I've been doing that all week.   
 Tried to convince myself for last 2 1/2 hours -- but I just didn't get it done. I hit a pretty good shot in regulation, my second shot, just didn't fly at all.   
 Yeah, Bruce played his heart out, he battled yesterday and battled through the first nine today. You know, that's just the way it is.  
  
  Q. The three-shot lead on the back side; were you playing defensively or did you still have your foot on the pedal?   
 JOHN COOK: You can't do that here. You have to step up and hit golf shots and unfortunately I hit a couple poor tee shots. Not poor, just off-line and the one on 11 cost me obviously and I hit one bad iron shot, No. 12, and that cost me.   
 Other than that, I hit pretty good shots. You know, you would like to say, yeah, you could back off the gas a little bit on this, but you can't on this golf course. You have to keep going at it and did doesn't give you much. I mean, I don't have the length where I can start hitting 3-wood and 6-irons into greens, so I've got to hit drivers. I drove the ball pretty solidly.   
 My game was off a little bit on the back side, but we'll go to the Broadmoor and try to regain myself.
