 Q. How did the game go today?
 JOHN COOK: Sloppy and not very good. Very disappointing.

 Q. Oh, I'm sorry. It was 30 years ago you and Mark were matched up. 
 JOHN COOK: Yeah.

 Q. Talk about how that felt. 
 JOHN COOK: Well, we play a lot of golf together, but it was pretty special walking around here, 30 years after the fact. 
 But to get off to a bad start and hit it in the wrong places and then he kind of rallied and then I started hitting it in the wrong places. And then it just wasn't, it wasn't the best of days for the both of us, but it's enjoyable being out there.

 Q. You got some birdies today. 
 JOHN COOK: Yeah, well, a couple. Not enough.
