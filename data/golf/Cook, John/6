 Q.   Good birdies on three of the last four holes.   Can you provide me with your overall thoughts on the day?  
JOHN COOK:   Yeah, it was better.   I struck the ball nicely today.   I had one errant shot at No. 6 and then a bad drive at 18.   But came out of 18 with a three.   
I just put myself in good position, I hit a lot of greens, and hit some good quality shots and made some timely putts, a couple good up‑and‑downs to keep the round going.   I played a solid back side.  
   
 Q.   You're only three shots off the lead right now, what are your thoughts heading into tomorrow?  
JOHN COOK:   Yeah, you got to keep, whoever it is in sight.   It's not going to take a whole lot.   It's going to take another good round, there's no doubt.   Those guys are, they have won a lot of tournaments and won a lot of Majors, so it's not like somebody's up there that shouldn't be there.   So you've got to keep them in sight and kind of pick your spots.   You got to play the par‑5s well.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on the course conditions and how they have played the last three days?  
JOHN COOK:   The conditions are great.   It's difficult.   The wind's blowing just hard enough to make it interesting.   It's blowing from a direction that really makes it difficult.   That's why the scores aren't terribly low like a couple years ago, where it was warm and the wind blew, but it didn't blow that hard, and the ball was going forever.   
The golf course is good.   The greens are a handful and you got to put it in the right spots or you're going to have a tough time.   Patience is a big key.   You got to have some good shots that aren't going to turn out so good and maybe some poor shots might turn out okay.   So you just got to keep plugging along and sign your name at the end of the day and see where you're at.
