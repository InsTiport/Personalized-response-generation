Q. So plus 3 today, 3 over.  How are you feeling about your performance?
JOHN COOK: Horrible.  Horrible.  I don't do this enough to get this upset, but I'm so upset that I can't even think.  I hit too many good shots to shoot the scores I do.  I don't play that much, but that's no excuse.  I'm just frustrated.
Q. Was there a certain part of your game that kind of fell apart more than the rest?
JOHN COOK: Yes.  I don't make enough putts.  I don't take advantage of good opportunities.  To beat these great players, you have to do that.  I haven't for a couple years.  It's starting to wear a little thin.
Q. On a little lighter note, how was it playing again with your two college pals?
JOHN COOK: Great.  Joey played great.  He really did.  Struck the ball nice, made some nice putts.  Rod struggled a little bit, but just being out there with those guys was pretty special this week.  Had a lot of family and friends and a lot of fans out there.  So that was great support.  It really was.
