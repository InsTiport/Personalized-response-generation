  Q. Can you just talk about the mindset today?   
 JOHN COOK: Yeah, it wasn't that easy, that's for sure. I didn't do myself any favors. I hit some good shots that didn't really turn out very good. I didn't capitalize on an early eagle, came right back with a bad double.   
 I played solid from then on. I didn't make any putts, hit a couple of good shots that turned out horrible. And just kind of got in at even. I thought that even would be an okay score. It's not very good, but it could have been much better.   
 Conditions weren't easy out there. That's for sure. I look forward to a better day tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Greens still slower than you might expect?   
 JOHN COOK: Yeah, I struggled with the speed. But that's okay. That's my issue: That's nobody else's issue. If they get much quicker, you lose tons of pins. They had some good pins out there today. They had some pins where you kind of take a shot at. The course was set up fine. I'd rather the greens be a little on the slow side so you would have some nice pins, otherwise you can't put pins anywhere. So I'm fine with that. That's my issue.   
 I just have to -- my brain and my hands have to work together and they just didn't do a very good job.  
  
  Q. Olin is 7-under this afternoon.  
 JOHN COOK: He's 7-under? He drives the ball great and hits quality iron shots. It doesn't surprise me. I think that's pretty low, obviously. I think that's pretty low. While it doesn't surprise me that somebody that controls his ball like Olin does would shoot a score like that. It gives the rest of us hope that it is out there. You've just got to be a little more precise.
