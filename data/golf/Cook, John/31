  Q. You've vaulted up to T3. Give me some thoughts on your round, what might have clicked out there.   
 JOHN COOK: I played well from the start. I hit some nice shots early. I played -- all those into-the-wind holes that are really tough I played well for the week, and I hit quality iron shots, much longer iron shots than these guys are hitting in, but I hit them all really well.   
 I just feel comfortable. I had nothing to lose this week. I enjoyed seeing everybody. I've seen guys I haven't seen in four or five years, and it was fun to come back and compete again for one last time.  
  
  Q. Talk about that a little bit, being able to bounce back to the PGA TOUR from the Champions Tour and the competition on both Tours and how it makes you feel to play with these guys.   
 JOHN COOK: Yeah, I think the important thing to know is the guys in their 50s haven't lost their competitiveness and they haven't lost their game. If our health holds, which at our age we're all starting to have health issues, but other than that, there's certain courses that we all can compete on still, whether it's Fred, whether it's me, Tom Lehman, it doesn't matter, Calcavecchia. It doesn't matter; certain courses we'll be able to compete on because that's what we've done. We know how to compete.
