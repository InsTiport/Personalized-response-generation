Q.  Where did this come from?
GARY SIMPSON:  I knew I had to shoot 67 or 68 to make the cut. Got off to a good start with birdie on the first and missed one on the second. I hit it to a foot on the third, lipped out for albatross. One of those days where I got the good bounces and I took full advantage of it. Hit four iron from 215 meters to the pin on the third. That was it. I was three under through three and didn't look back.

I've been playing up in Asia all last year. Went to qualifying school and secured my card by finishing 54th on the Order of Merit. Looking forward to going back up there again next week.

Best finish - tied fifth at the Volkswagen Masters-China in Beijing.
Q.  Where are the Vines in South Australia?
GARY SIMPSON:  It's in Happy Valley, the suburb. It's south of Adelaide. It's a strange little twist. It's called the Vines Reynella (wine growing region) and it's always nice to come to another course called the Vines. Almost like home away from home. I played here in the Heineken some years ago, shot a 67 to make the cut. I thought this year, after last year where I played nicely, I was looking forward to a good start to the year. There are some good tournaments in Asia over the next five weeks. I thought if I could get off to a good start here it will set me up for the rest of the year.
Q.  Is this your career low?
GARY SIMPSON:  I had 9-under at the ANZ Championship some seven years ago, the one that Peter Lonard won. Shot 9-under in the last round. It's the personal best
