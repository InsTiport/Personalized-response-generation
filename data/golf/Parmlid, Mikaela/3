  Q. Talk about having to play with all these delays?  
 MIKAELA PARMLID: You know, it's just the weather, so I can't really do anything about it. So I just take it positive, and just waited.   
  
  Q. How hard is it to start up your round when you just got a few holes to play?  
 MIKAELA PARMLID: It's not hard. It's just, you know, you gotta be just relaxed and just you've gotta play the rest the holes just nice and easy.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing?  
 MIKAELA PARMLID: It's kind of wet now, so it has to dry tomorrow. I hope it gets dry tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What do you say are the differences between your first versus your second round was?   
 MIKAELA PARMLID: I was kind of struggling today. I mean, second round couldn't get any birdies. And, yeah, in the windy and the raining.   
 So, yeah, oh, well. I'll get it tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Perfect. Thank you.   
 MIKAELA PARMLID: Thank you.
