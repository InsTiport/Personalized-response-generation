Q. That putt, very similar to the putt you had to win the KPMG Women's PGA Championship. Did that experience and that confidence take you over the finish line today?
HANNAH GREEN: Yeah, definitely. This golf course is quite tough in a way. I played a lot better today than I did yesterday, but I knew that I had to stay patient. Yealimi made some putts early in the round and unfortunately you don't usually hole them the whole entire day.
I just needed to make sure that I was giving myself as many opportunities, and I think I did really well. The first putt I hit on 18, I wanted it a bit closer, to put more pressure on her, but yeah, to hole that putt is really awesome.
Q. You had a couple other opportunities midway through the back nine to close the gap. What were you telling yourself?
HANNAH GREEN: Yeah, I just really needed to stay positive. I was really chatty with Nate again today. I was in my own head yesterday and I think it probably showed even to the viewers. I just knew that they were getting firm and if you have an opportunity to make birdie, you really want to capitalize. I mean, it's hard to put pressure on yourself like that, but I think it has worked my way this week.
