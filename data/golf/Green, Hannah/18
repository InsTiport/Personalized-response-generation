Q. Last year you missed the cut but a totally different story today; you were telling me you putted really well, 24, 25 putts, maybe 23. Is it something where you really like the pace and the texture of these greens?
HANNAH GREEN: Yeah, as soon as I got here, I didn't play the weekend in Canada, so I worked pretty hard on my putting, and as soon as I got to the first hole, actually I hit it like 10 foot past from a 15-foot putt, so I knew that they were rolling really well and going to be quick, which is what I like to play on. Yeah, I knew putting was really key this week. I'd say it's one of the shorter courses that we play, and it definitely looked more narrow, so I knew if I kept doing what I was doing and hitting good shots and just holing a couple putts here and there that you could post a really good score.
Q. As you're hitting good shots, getting good numbers, hitting good approach shots and seeing the putts drop, does your confidence continue to grow throughout a round like this?
HANNAH GREEN: Yeah, definitely. I birdied the last three holes. But just today I was really solid from six foot and in, which I had a lot of those type of putts today, as well. Who knows if maybe I missed one of them, I wouldn't have shot the score I did today. But certainly with that putt on the last, I think this is my career best score on LPGA and tied for my personal career best, so I just wanted to make sure that I at least gave it a go and when it fell in I was really pleased to shoot 8-under.
