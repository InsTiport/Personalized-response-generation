 Q.  Describe your emotions on the last hole on that last putt.  
HANNAH GREEN: I'm pretty much speechless.  I was really nervous the last five holes and just really -- I made a clutch putt and that was kind of got me through another one.  To make the one on the last is really is surreal.   
 Q.  Your mom watching at home, Karrie Webb and all your friends watching in-person.  Sharing this moment with them and their support, what does that mean to you?  
HANNAH GREEN: It's awesome.  I've always wanted to win in front of an Aussie crowd.  I felt even that's what it was like today.  Anything to just be winning in Majors the first event.   
 Q.  At what point did the nerves start to settle in today?  
HANNAH GREEN: I actually didn't feel too nervous the first few.  I felt pretty good about how I was going to hit but definitely coming towards the back-9 -- I think missing the putt on 8 and 9, that really hurt and probably wasn't in the right head space for that and just making the putt on 16.  Obviously I heard Sung made the last one, knew I needed to make par.  Didn't want to play that hole again.  I'm really happy I made it
