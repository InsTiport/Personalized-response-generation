Q. Take me through No. 14 today.
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN:   I didn't expect that coming, but it was a good shot.  I hit it pretty solid.  Just knew that it was definitely going to be a carry where I wanted it, and I saw that it went in.
Q. What was it like making that decision?  I know you used a pitching wedge; what went into the decision there?
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN:   It's about 117 front, so just choked down a little bit and just punched that pitching wedge.  Actually that's my favorite club, so it's really cool to be able to make it, and it went pretty straight, so I'm really happy about it.
Q. Did you have any celebration after you made it or did you not realize it went in?
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN:   Well, yes, we saw that, so we did a little -- like a high-five.  We shouldn't do that, but it was fun, yeah.  Got to celebrate with everyone.
Q. Every hole-in-one this year, as like last year, $20,000 gets donated to St. Jude.
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN:   That's so cool.
Q. What does it mean that something like an ace can contribute so much?
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN:   So I think it's a really good thing that the LPGA definitely donates this much amount of money to the foundation, the St. Jude, so it's really cool that they keep doing it.  Pretty much hopefully we keep doing this.  Hopefully the players will continue to make some hole-in-ones, and that would be a really good advantage for them to have the foundation going, so it's really good.
