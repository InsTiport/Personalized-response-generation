 Q.  Give us an idea how you're feeling.  Cruised past the cut line in your rookie as well.  Going great.  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: Yeah, it was a great day out there.  I've been hitting very well.  Missed couple putts, but still really happy with my game.  My putting has really definitely helped me a lot.   
 Q.  Speed of the greens as well?  Have they got quicker over the last 48 hours?  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: I would say yes.  It's a little faster as they get warmer.  Yeah.   
 Q.  We hear the bad weather may be on the way.  Do you change the game plan, the way you're thinking heading into the weekend?  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: Not really.  Just try to stick to my game plan.  Pretty much just try to stay focused and then commit to every shot that I can.  Just try my best every single shot.   
 Q.  Anything you feel you need to work on before the third round?  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: Well, try to hit the fairway.  That's definitely my No. 1 goal.  Fairway, green, make some putts, yeah.   
 Q.  The rough is still pretty tough here?  Still long?  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: Yeah, definitely.  You don't wanting to go in there.  But, yeah, try to hit a good drive.  If it's in the rough, just try to hit it out and just make it to like a safe zone.   
 Q.  Are you enjoying the weather as well?  Similar to Thailand.  Maybe not as humid, but very much as hot.  
PAJAREE ANANNARUKARN: Yeah, definitely really close to Thailand because where I'm from is quite hot.  So definitely, yeah, getting used to it.
