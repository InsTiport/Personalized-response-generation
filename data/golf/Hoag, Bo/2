Q. You know this course as well as anyone.  How tough is it out there right now?
BO HOAG:   It's hard, yeah.  Yeah, unfortunately it's not very similar to how I play it day in, day out, just a little firmer and faster.  But it's great.  It's playing -- I think the course is fantastic.  I think it's fair.  You're rewarded for good shots, but if you're off a little bit, you'll get penalized.
Q. You were pretty pumped after yesterday's round, just the bogeys were biting you today, huh?
BO HOAG:   Yeah, you know, it was just tough out there.  I feel like I hit a lot of good shots today and ended up -- if you just miss a little bit, you get short-sided, and the best thing you can have is maybe a 30-footer for par.  Yeah, just did that a few too many times out there.
Q. I know how special this place is for you.  Your grandfather's hand prints are all over this place.  What's your mindset coming into tomorrow and what do you think?
BO HOAG:   Yeah, I'll probably be one of the earlier groups tomorrow and just try to shoot the low round of the day tomorrow and whatever else happens there.  But yeah, just try to be the low round out there on Sunday.
Q. You're so upbeat, you're just --
BO HOAG:   Got to.
Q. It's the game, golf, right?
BO HOAG:   Yeah, game beats you up so much, you've got to be your own best friend out there.
