 Q.  What's the thoughts on knocking out the host of the championship?  
RICHARD GREEN: It's been two hard matches really.  Both are great guys, and obviously Paul's the man of the week and stuff.  So it was hard to know sort of what sort of outcome was going to happen.  I just had to go play my game again and see what happened.   
Wasn't great early on.  I was a little bit sort of out of rhythm early on but sort of found my feet a bit towards the back end of the round again.  It was good.   
 Q.  You finished in some style, forcing it to 18, winning it there and forcing an extra hole after?  
RICHARD GREEN: Absolutely, yeah.  Just had to take the opportunities when I could coming in.  I knew 18 would be a chance of a birdie probably, square it up, and fortunately I was able to do it.   
 Q.  Now a further match to come.  Busy day for you.  
RICHARD GREEN: Yeah, 36 holes is a lot of golf but hopefully won't have to go that far.   
 Q.  Energy levels, they are good?  
RICHARD GREEN: Yeah, I'll just go and load up on some food now and make sure I'm ready to go.
