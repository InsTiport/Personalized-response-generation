Q.   Your thoughts on 8â€‘under par after two rounds? 
RICHARD GREEN:   Very happy really.   I've just come off a break over Christmas and haven't played for four weeks.   I played very nicely on the Australian Tour, and sort of took confidence from there and started the season fresh and off we go again.   It's been good.

Q.   Sometimes you want to just carry on playing and the break does some damage; this time, it doesn't seem to have?
RICHARD GREEN:   Sometimes.   The older I get, I feel a little bit stiffer trying to get the body in shape.   But I've been putting in a bit of work last week to get ready for this week and it's nice to be in this position after two rounds.

Q.   Are you having to work harder? 
RICHARD GREEN:   Yeah, definitely.   Yeah, definitely, in all aspects, in fitness and just stay on top of being injury free, and also practicing hard against the guys, don't leave any room for error, and you have to perform.

Q.   Does that mean a few extra hours in the gym, as well as bashing a few more balls? 
RICHARD GREEN:   Yeah, absolutely.   For probably the last year and a half now, I've been working really hard in the gym to keep the fitness up at a level where I'm competitive and I've been doing that pretty well.

Q.   It's nice to see you competitive back here again.   Does your mind go back to the winning the Desert Classic, because you seem to thrive on this style of golf course. 
RICHARD GREEN:   Yeah, absolutely.   I've come here in recent years and struggled a little bit but I feel that this sort of golf suits my game.   I love the weather conditions and I've always enjoyed playing in the Middle East. 
It's great memories, like you say, of the Dubai Desert Classic and hopefully I can just draw on those memories and perform again.
