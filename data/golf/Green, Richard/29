 Q. Very steady indeed; that's the word, one birdie, no bogeys today. How did you rate it? 
   RICHARD GREEN: Well, a better ball-striking round of golf than I had the first to days. I scored very well the first two days and made the birdies when I needed to. 
   But today, you know, they stayed out but I played -- all in all, I hit the ball great today and pretty happy with how I'm playing and it's just a matter of a little bit of luck with the short stuff and the putting and you know, who knows, I might shoot a low score tomorrow.

   Q. You had a couple of strong finishes in the last few weeks, talking earlier on about deliberately timing your form to coincide with a major championship; after that stunning 64 in the last round of Carnoustie last year is that the sort of thing that you're trying to do? 
   RICHARD GREEN: Definitely, yeah. I mean, if you can put The Open Championship in your schedule or any major, and have it early in the schedule, you can try and plan your game and try and time your form to be right on song and ready for that tournament. That's really in the back of my mind where I want my form to be is ready for next week. 

   Q. Well never mind Birkdale, first thing is first, a 64 would certainly see you right?
   RICHARD GREEN: I've done it before and I would love to do it tomorrow.
