RICHARD GREEN:  It was just a nice day.  Did better than I did yesterday.  It was a good, solid day.
Q.  The conditions, the wind picked up.
RICHARD GREEN:  Yeah, it was pretty similar to yesterday, as well.  The wind was up but I'm quite happy with it.
Q.  And it's a pretty bunched leaderboard up there, isn't it, earn any and Tiger up there, how are you feeling about tomorrow?
RICHARD GREEN:  Not too bad.  I think it's going to require a good score tomorrow.  It's going to need something like I did on Thursday.  I feel like I've got it in me.

I don't need to do that    inaudible.  Sure, I'll be thinking about that.  It's nice to sort of have in the memory bank and take it into tomorrow as well.  I know I can do it.  We'll see what happens.
