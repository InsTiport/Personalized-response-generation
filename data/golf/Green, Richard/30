 Q. Terrific round of golf. Any particular aspect of your game that was key to that success?
 RICHARD GREEN: I just think the focus was pretty good today. I just focused very hard on just concentrating hard basically, you know, and it worked out pretty well. Hit some pretty nice iron shots, which kind of surprised me a little bit because my iron play hasn't been that great the first half of the year. 
 And I think my confidence is good coming into this tournament. I played well last year, had some good rounds of golf here and I think that was probably the key to the round today.

 Q. Give us a sense of the playing conditions; looks ideal. 
 RICHARD GREEN: Yeah, it's ideal. 22, 23 degrees, bright sunshine, about as good as it gets.

 Q. You've played a few tournaments in America, and a handful over here; are you trying to split both tours? What is your status? 
 RICHARD GREEN: Yeah, a little bit, I had a Top-50 category in the world for a little while and I'm not in there now. And was Top-50 end of last year and that got me into a lot of tournaments and potentially a lot through the year. 
 But I've slipped down, so now I've come back to sort of try and work away on the Tour out here for a while and see if I can get back in the Top-50 by the end of the year and see if I can play the Masters again.

 Q. Confident you can kick on now with the big tournaments coming up? 
 RICHARD GREEN: Yeah, a little run now up to the Open and I feel good about things. I'm just going to try and press on and achieve the goal by the end of the year. 
 Last year gave me a lot of confidence that I can win a tournament. I really enjoyed the British Open and I had quite a great experience there now, and it's definitely one of those sort of weeks where a lot of different things can happen and if you get your game on the right time, you can go ahead and win. I feel confident about doing that.
