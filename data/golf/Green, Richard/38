RICHARD GREEN:  It was a working-class sort of day. Things were not happening on the front nine but I managed to birdie the last two - made a couple of good putts - and eked out a decent score. The conditions were tougher for us in the afternoon than the morning guys with the heat and wind and the greening getting drier and crustier.

It was difficult to get the ball near the hole. I was pleased to score as well at the end of the day and pleased with my attitude for keeping at it. I've got a job of work to do tomorrow and hopefully I can get closer to the lead for Sunday.
