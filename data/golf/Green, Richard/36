Q.  I guess it's stating the obvious that the start cost you?
RICHARD GREEN:  I jumped off and it bit me earlier and got a bit nervous as well and just let the bad thoughts come in unfortunately. A few lazy swings and didn't quite make it up. I didn't give up back there. I won a bit of battle with myself. I played against myself for the rest of the day and I was determined to finish under par for the day and that worked out in the end.
Q.  Two thirds now?
RICHARD GREEN:  Two thirds these last two weeks, I'm playing great golf. It's just a matter of time.
Q.  What's next for you?
RICHARD GREEN:  A week's break now and the world Match-Play. I'll press on. If I win a few matches there, get on a roll there, you'll never know what can happen. Nick's been knocking on the door a bit longer for the past year and all of this year so far, he's going to win soon I'm sure. We'll keep pressing on.
Q.  Quite a shot from Kevin at the last?
RICHARD GREEN:  It was an amazing shot. I think he was quietly confident of hitting that shot close. He kind of looked good and good on him.
