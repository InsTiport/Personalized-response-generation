A flash interview with:   
JACK MAGUIRE   
 Q.  Fantastic shot there.  Give a history of hole-in-ones.  Is that your first?  You, through the Quicken Loans Hole-in-One Sweepstakes, afforded someone a year of no mortgage payments.  
JACK MAGUIRE: Yeah, it was actually my third hole-in-one and still haven't seen any of them go in.   
Yeah, I hit a 7-iron.  And actually, I could see it in the air and it didn't leave the pin the entire time.  Glare on the green, couldn't see it at all.   
I was about halfway down the tee boxes until everyone just kind of went wild.  So then I knew it went in.   
It's exciting.  The Quicken Loans Sweepstakes, Steve from Kansas City gets a free mortgage for a year.  It's pretty cool.
