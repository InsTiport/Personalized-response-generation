Q. Just talk us through that match.  Obviously super back and forth?
MEGHA GANNE: Yeah, when I saw when I was playing against Gina, I was like, Oh, of course I get put against Gina Kim.  She's a good friend of mine, and I know what a good fighter she is.  So I just -- last night I was ready to put on everything I had, if I was going to take her on, and we both played absolutely amazing.  It was just -- it went 1-down, all square, 1-down, all square, and I didn't get up in the match until late, and then Gina had a chance to get -- we were both off the green on 17, and we both were chipping, and I was talking to my caddie, and I said, I would be shocked if she didn't hole this out, and of course she holed it out for birdie, and we were all square on 18.  I just stuck to the game plan.  I played conservative.  I took 3-wood instead of driver, and I made par, and it just ended up my way.
Q. What have you learned playing stroke play here on this course to be successful here at Old Waverley?
MEGHA GANNE: To be successful here, you definitely have to have two things going for you, and that's your driving accuracy and just patience because there's so many hole positions, and just like slopes that you'll think it's going in every single time, and it will not go in the hole.  It doesn't mean you're a bad putter, it just means the greens are that difficult, so you've just got to stay patient with it.
Q. Your first time reaching this far in the Women's Amateur.  What does that mean to you and what's the game plan the rest of the week?
MEGHA GANNE: It means a lot because I just came back from the U.S. Junior and I got out early, so I was really looking forward to this to be like a redemption, and I'm really excited to see how far I can go.
