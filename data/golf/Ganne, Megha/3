 Q.  You really had to battle in that one, long matches.  Take us through it.  
MEGHA GANNE: Well, that was the hardest one out of 64, 32 and 16.  I finished on the 18th hole in the first match, 19th hole in the second match, and we were joking, we were like, why don't we go 20 on the last one, and as I was walking to the 20th hole, I was like, oh, my God, what have I done to myself.  I hit three really good shots, and it ended up well.   
 Q.  You got off to a hot start in both your matches today and then they've tied it up.  Talk about the up-and-down emotions of match play.  
MEGHA GANNE: Yeah, it's like one moment you feel like you're on top of the world and the next it's like you can't make a putt.  So I'm happy that I've been able to pull it together even after I hit those low points.  Just happy about my perseverance.   
 Q.  You're quarterfinalist.  What does that mean to you?  You're automatically in for next year.  
MEGHA GANNE: Oh, that means -- I didn't know that until now, so I'm even more happy now, because qualifying for these isn't easy.  It means a lot to me.  I feel like it was just yesterday I was watching as like a little kid on TV the quarterfinalists in their interviews, and now I'm doing one, so it's cool.
