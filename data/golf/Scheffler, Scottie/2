  Q. Scottie, looked like you had command as you made the turn; back nine you gave a couple away.  What were you able to do to stay positive and ultimately come back and win this match?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I felt really good about how I was playing all day.  My stroke felt good.  My swing felt very good and I was comfortable.  I think I was almost too comfortable.  Kind of lost focus on 12 and 13.  12, bad shot.  Can't do that.  Had to keep the pressure on him.  13 I really hit a good shot.  I don't know how it came up short.
 I felt good about my game and I knew if I kept executing and hitting good shots I would have a chance to win.
 Q. What a great match.  Finally ended here at 18.  I thought that birdie you made at 9 and the one at 11, that set the stage.  I know 12 and 13 weren't what you wanted.  Those two birdies really set you up well.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I would say so.  That was a really good birdie on 9.  Made another great putt at 11.  I think I got a little too comfortable with my lead and just lost focus.  Was able to kind of keep it going, kept things in check.
 Gave myself some nice looks down the stretch.  Hit a great putt at 16.  Really great putt here that I thought was going in.  Fortunately Matt didn't make his putt to keep things going.
 Q. Horschel in the championship match.  I think the winds will die down a little bit in the afternoon, sun will come out.  These were tough conditions this morning.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, very tough conditions.  Sun is coming out and it's warming up a little bit.  Should be a fun match.  I love playing golf with Billy.  He is one of my favorite guys out here, so looking forward to this afternoon.
