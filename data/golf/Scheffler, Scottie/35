Q.   Talk about your round. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Started off okay, then I had a hiccup on 14, hit it out‑of‑bounds and made some dumb mistakes, but I finished good. 

Q.   What is it like having your sister out there with you as your caddy? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It felt pretty normal.   She has caddied before, wasn't anything different. 

Q.   What was it like today, this whole experience? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It was pretty fun.   There was a lot of people out watching, so that was a good experience. 

Q.   Did you notice your classmates and teammates were out there watching?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I noticed them.   They were all yelling and stuff. 

Q.   Does that give you motivation to play out there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, yeah, definitely.   It was really fun today.   I want to keep doing it. 

Q.   How many people were out there by the end when you started getting hot? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I don't know.   I wasn't paying that close attention. 

Q.   The shot on No. 5 got you going.   What did you hit there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   A little 9‑iron.   It was good. 

Q.   Did you kind of say, that's about time? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, that was‑‑ my only really‑‑ my first good birdie was on 3, so that was my 12th hole today, so that was frustrating, I finally started hitting good shots at the end. 

Q.   On No. 14, did you a hit 3‑wood off the tee? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I hit 3‑wood, just double crossed it and I was trying to hit a cut. 

Q.   Would you typically hit 3‑wood there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, well usually I hit driver because the wind is blowing in our face, but I went with 3‑wood because it wasn't.   It was the right club, just made a bad swing, I think. 

Q.   When you say "dumb mistake" what are you referring to? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Like that?   (Laughter.)   I hit it 40 yards left of where I was aiming. 

Q.   Okay, so you got over there and what was going on?   I was there and people were looking for your ball. 
>> The spotter said he heard it hit a fence and we couldn't find it.   Then a spectator said it was on the other side.   We didn't know what fence it hit because we couldn't see it from the tee, so we didn't know what was going on. 

Q.   Would it have made a difference if you'd seen‑‑ actually been able to see the ball in the ravine?   Would you have been able to play it there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Maybe, but I probably would have still had to chip out, I think. 

Q.   Okay.   Three birdies in a row, 5, 6 and 7?   What was the difference in your game there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I was just getting it in play, finally hit some decent iron shots, too, so that was good. 

Q.   Were you nervous at all? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   At the beginning I was pretty nervous, and I felt I settled into my round pretty well.   I just wasn't playing good. 

Q.   How much did it help to have a family member with you, caddy? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It helped a lot. 

Q.   Help you settle down? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, it was comfortable. 

Q.   How about this A&M?   She was wearing an A&M shirt. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, she was.   I don't care! 

Q.   So was it a plus or minus having your friends, your family, the TV cameras?   We were all following you. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It was definitely a plus.   It was really fun.   None of my friends ever seen me play golf before, so it was a good day for that.   Good day for me, too. 

Q.   Did you have enough or Oreo's out there? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Me?   No, my sister kept trying to give me some, but I didn't have any. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Just have fun.   That's what I heard from everybody, just enjoy it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Scottie.
