 Q.   Overall how was the week?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It was very, very fun.   I had a lot of fun this week.   It was good.   
   
 Q.   What do you think this week does for your game in general?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It gives me a little bit of confidence and now I have some more stuff that I can work on going forward.   
   
 Q.   What's that?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Fine tuning things, each day there was something a little bit wrong with the way I was playing, like Friday was fairways, yesterday I was missing short putts, today my speed was off on the greens and the first day I got off to a rough start.   
   
 Q.   You putted better today than yesterday.   Did you make an adjustment?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, me and Randy worked on some stuff on the putting green.   I think my stroke on the short putts was way too long, so it was really hard.   I got it shortened up a little bit and it seemed to be working pretty well on the short ones today.   
   
 Q.   Scottie, you will remember this week forever.   Specifically what memories will stick out?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   The hole‑in‑one, probably, and then coming up 17 and 18, there was a lot of people, and having all my friends come out to watch was really cool.   
   
 Q.   Were you able to celebrate that hole‑in‑one moment?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I was so surprised by it, I didn't know what to do, I just kind of stuck my hands up and gave Callie a hug.   
   
 Q.   Did you have to buy 7‑Ups in the clubhouse?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   No, no one asked me for any drinks.   
   
 Q.   Did Callie pick the club on that hole?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, yeah, she picked the club.   
   
 Q.   Second shot today on 18, what club did you hit?   What were you thinking?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   5‑iron.   I just wanted to start off on that bunker and hit a draw.   I hit it really, really good but it came short.   
   
 Q.   You seemed pleased.   Were you just glad you executed what you wanted to do?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, definitely, because that's a tough shot.   I thought it was going to be right on the pin but it didn't bounce up.   
   
 Q.   Now that it's all done, what did you prove to yourself this week?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Gave myself a lot of confidence going forward and I've got some stuff to work on going forward.   Not just confidence, I've got some stuff I need to do.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like, you know, there's room to grow obviously, but you can "hang"‑‑  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, no, I got to let everything sink in first, and I really don't know what to say right now.   
   
 Q.   Last I saw you were tied for 26.   Roughly that would be around $55,000 if you weren't an amateur.   What do you think about that?   
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I don't know.   Jordan told me I would be mad when I get down to Austin next year and I don't have any money.   (Laughter.)  
I guess I'll be mad then.   I'm not too upset right now.   
  
THE MODERATOR:   Scottie, thank you.   Appreciate it.
