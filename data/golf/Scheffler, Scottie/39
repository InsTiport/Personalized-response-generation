  THE MODERATOR:   We have Scottie Scheffler here with us, 2013 U.S. Junior Amateur champion.   Scottie, the first question before everybody jumps in here is to win four holes in a row like that to become a Junior Amateur champion at the end there and then to see your name on the‑‑ well, eventually see your name on the trophy with the likes of Johnny Miller and those kind of folks, what does that feel like right now? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Feels pretty good.   (Inaudible) to know I won four holes. 

Q.   Obviously, we have to ask about all the second places, all the close calls, including last year.   I mean, how does it feel to finally feel get that monkey off your back?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It feels pretty good.   I mean, during the tournaments, I don't really think about (inaudible) or stuff like that.   If I came in second then I could think about it.

Q.   Did you think about it at all when you were down holes in the match today?   Did you think, oh, my God, here I go again?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Not really.   I stayed pretty level headed today.

Q.   How about the fact that you got 3‑down early?   Did you say, okay, I know it's a 36‑hole final, a long day, it's a different type of thing that you would have had earlier in the week with an 18‑hole match.   Did your mindset kind of change?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I remember talking to (inaudible) right after I got 3‑down (inaudible).

Q.   Talk about, you know, coming out of the double bogey at 4.   That's got to be probably the worst way to start.   What was going through your mind after that?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I had a terrible shot on 1 from the fairway.   I was really nervous on the chip (inaudible).

Q.   Did you talk to Davis at all the last nine?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I hung out with him yesterday afternoon.

Q.   Can you talk about that 265 yards with that three metal on 14, 15?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It goes 250.   It was a hybrid.

Q.   Did you know that one was‑‑
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I hit it pretty good.   I was trying to get it on the front of the green because I like (inaudible), hit it pretty good.

Q.   Talk about the putts you missed, I think, on 13 to get it all square.   Did you think, okay, it's a whole new ball game, five holes to go, you've been battling uphill all day and now you have things square?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I wasn't watching him putt today.   I was just listening to the people.   It happens.   People miss putts. 

Q.   He lipped out, I think, on 15, 3‑putted that green.   Talk about your look on 9in the afternoon.   You lipped it outand then you went to putt it again and it lipped out again. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Two bad strokes.   It happens.

Q.   You didn't really take too much stock in that, maybe it's not my day orjust ‑‑
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   No.   I mean, if I would have hit a good putt then I (inaudible).

Q.   Tenth tee, there was a little bit of a cart ride there.   Did you regroup yourself and say anything to yourself mentally, I have got nine holes left and‑‑
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Not really.   I mean, when I got to the tenth tee, I got over that tee (inaudible).

Q.   Talk about the par‑3, 14th hole.   Yesterday you know you basically beat Doug Ghim on that hole.   Make a long birdie putt this morning and then you make it from the fringe?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, that hole has been pretty good to me.   I don't know how it flew that far, and I don't know how it stopped.

Q.   Was that an iron?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Wedge.

Q.   Wedge, okay.

Got on the tee, he grabbed the pin (inaudible).   I mean, we talked, but he wasn't telling me how to (inaudible).   It was good.

Q.   Quite different interaction between you and him versus (inaudible) caddie, a little animated out there.   Did he talk at all much during the week?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, we did.   Whenever I do something stupid or get kind of greedy(inaudible).   Sometimes I start playing a little too quick when I'm nervous, but I couldn't (inaudible). 

Q.   You had to wait for him. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I'd get to the ball, I get all my yardage and prepare for the shot.   He would show up, I would grab the club and shoot.

Q.   So in a way he slowed you down?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, it was good.

Q.   Watching too much Golf Channel, you get emotional talking about James.   Talk about the 14th hole.   You said you were thinking about him there?

SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, feels pretty good. 

Q.   Is it the (inaudible) in Texas?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I think you learn how to hit a bunch of shots.   You need a bunch of shots.

Q.   (Inaudible) 30, 40, 50 guys out here.   There's really not a whole lot of difference between(inaudible).   Getting through a week like this, and when it's a stressful situation (inaudible)?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   A lot of it.   You have to be‑‑ to win all your matches, you have to (inaudible).   I mean, you have to make putts.   You need to perform.

Q.   You went extra holes against Justin?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   That was really nerve wracking.   It was a (inaudible), but it was really, really good.
