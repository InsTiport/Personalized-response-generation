Q. Talk about your play?SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I played okay.  I wasn't hitting it close enough to make a bunch of birdies, but I missed some greens and had some good up-and-downs.Q. It's one of the better rounds so far this morning.SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, we're pretty early, aren't we?  So, yeah, someone's going to figure out how to make some putts.  The pins are in some weird spots, someone will figure out a way to make a lot of birdies, I think.Q. What did you think of the Riverside Course?SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: It's good.  I think it's probably the best alternate course I've played in the few years I've played in this.  It's fair and they put some tough pins today, so it wasn't really playing as easy as I thought it would.  But that's just the way it was.Q. How much do you practice on an alternative course?SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: How much do I practice?  I think my practice round was on Saturday, so this is my first time seeing everything here, so I was just getting used to the rough, getting used to the greens.  These are a little different than the ones on the Highlands, but just getting used to everything around the greens I would say.Q. All your experience in USGA events and the success you had this last year, when you came into this today, were you calm?SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I was pretty calm.  Got the first tee ball on the fairway.  I think I birdied the first hole so I was feeling pretty good, but after that I couldn't really get anything going.  But still happy with my round today.  Hopefully it's not too far back, and I'll have a little room to work with tomorrow on the Highlands.
