 Q.  Firstly, can you just kind of talk about your play today.  Kind of just an overview.  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Well, I hit it really, really bad.  I couldn't get the ball in the fairway and some of these (indiscernible) from the fairway.  I felt pretty good.  My short game was all right.  I just hit it in some spots where you couldn't really hit it today.   
 Q.  So what was the difference from playing today versus on Thursday?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Like the course?  Differences in the course?   
 Q.  Course, anything.  Did you feel that there was a difference.  Did you feel better, worse?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: The course seemed to play about the same, but my game didn't feel very good.  Like I said, I wanted to hit the ball on the fairway.  You can't really play from the rough out here.   
 Q.  So you had a day break in between play.  What did you do in between time?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I got some rest yesterday, got some sleep.  Then practiced a little bit, just kind of hung out.   
 Q.  And was that kind of looming in the back of your mind that you'd be out there today?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, a tiny bit.  I really -- once I started making a couple of bogeys on the back nine, it kind of got in my mind a little bit, which isn't good when I kind of think about it.
