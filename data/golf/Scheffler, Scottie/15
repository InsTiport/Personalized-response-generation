  Q. Just talk about what happened out there and what you've heard.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   He was trying to jump to see where my ball was on No. 9 with the bag on his back, and went down pretty quick after.  We didn't know what happened at the time, but he couldn't stand up, so it was pretty -- obviously wasn't going to be able to keeping.
 Q. And what's the prognosis, or diagnosis, I guess?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   We don't know anything now.  They said we'll find out in the morning -- with this, that's what the doctor told us with, this type of injury, we'll find out in the morning, if it's really bruised, he's in trouble, but if not, he'll be all right.
