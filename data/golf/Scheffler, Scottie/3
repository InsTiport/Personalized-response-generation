  Q. Ian Poulter, past champion, undefeated so far this week and has a reputation for one heck of a performer in match play.  What were you able to do so well to take him down in dominate fashion?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I got up early in the match.  I had a small lead on the front nine and I just kept putting the pressure on him.  I didn't really give him much room to work with, especially making the turn.  I had a nice birdie on 8; great par save on 9; and 10, 11, 12, 13 I really put it on him.
 A guy like that, you give him an inch he's going to turn the door wide open and flip the match on me, so I knew I couldn't give him anything.  I was able to do that today.
 Q. Now you have to think about the next match.  What emotionally and mentally will you do right now?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Same thinking as always:  Go have some lunch, put my feet up for a few minutes, get a nice stretch, and hit a few balls and go play.
 Q. The match Ian Poulter.  When I told you last night you were playing Ian you didn't roll your eyes and say, I know.  Your eyes lit up and said, I know, as if this is a great opportunity to show everyone what I can do.  You showed us, buddy.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, thanks.  It was a good match today.  I played some good golf and kept the pressure on him the whole day and ended up with a win.
 Q. You told me last night that he's such a good match player you just can't assume he's going to miss anything.  You expect him to make everything.  Son of a gun, he almost did.  What a great hole at like 11 with you both guys holing and again at 13.  Just so much there where the momentum could have swung but you stood your ground.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I kept the intensity up all day.  You could tell by the look in his eye that he wasn't given in at all.  He was just waiting for a spark.  He had some really good opportunities.  Hit a great shot into 10 and I kind of took that hole away from him, and then another great putt on 11 and I kind of stole one again and really just kept the momentum on my side.
 Q. When you can have that experience and enjoy it and come out on top at such a young age, wow, that will serve you well not just this weekend, but for your entire PGA career.
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I'm sure it's good experience getting in here and getting some match play experience in.  I've learned a lot the first couple days and looked forward to this afternoon's match.
