Q. Looked like you were cruising along until 18?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I was playing pretty good.  I had a good front nine, it was pretty solid.  And my putter got a little cold on the back nine.  I was shooting good putts, they just weren't falling and I had a rough finish.
Q. I didn't see what happened at 18.  Can you take me through the hole a little bit?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I pulled my driver, it ended up in the hay, and I was able to get it back out on the fairway, but I didn't hit my iron shot the way I wanted to, and I found myself in a really difficult spot around the green.  Got it out of the bunker, and then I chipped it on and ended up three-putting.  So it happens.
Q. You're right next to the top for low amateur.  What would it mean for you to be low amateur here?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: That would be very special.  It's only me and Cameron who made the cut, so I don't think I'm really going to focus on how he's playing tomorrow.  I'm just going to do my own thing, and see if I can move back up the leaderboard.
Q. How was the course playing today compared to the first couple days?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I thought it was playing a lot easier today.  The greens were fairly soft.  They moved around the tees a little bit, but the pins were in some gettable locations as well.  But, yeah.
Q. You and Cam know each other pretty well, right?  You obviously played at Texas A&M.  But you traveled with him in a youth tournament when you were younger?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, we played two youth tournaments together.  We played the Junior Ryder Cup together, and we played the Toyota Junior World Cup together.
Q. So fair to say it's a friendly rivalry?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, yeah.  We're good buddies.
Q. You said you're going to focus on your game tomorrow.  But what is some stuff you want to improve on compared to today?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I drove it pretty well today.  I need to clean up some stuff with my putter.  But for the most part I was pretty happy with the way I played today.  I had the hiccup on 18.  But that's what happens on a U.S. Open golf course.  You put yourself out of position, lose focus, and that's what it gets you.
Q. Do you feel like you lost focus on that hole?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I got a little frantic around the green.  I didn't really expect to have to get up-and-down for the par on the par 5.  I was in a really difficult spot in that bunker, and I got it out, but then I ended up three-putting, which happens.
Q. And you had some really good opportunities on those holes before that.  I guess, 12, 14, 15, 16, all kind of makeable putts.  Did that build up any frustration?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: No, I mean, I was fine.  Par is not bad out here.  I mean, pars are fine.  But it wasn't any frustration with it.  Putts just weren't going in.  There were just putts, I can't do anything about it.
Q. Have you played any better than you were playing on the front nine?
REPLACENAME: Yeah, I've played better.
Q. At a U.S. Open venue?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Not at a U.S. Open, but, yeah, I had it going pretty good.  But I cooled off on the back nine a little bit.
Q. Are you aware of the longhorn history of a bunch of guys that have been low am?  I don't know what your goals are for the rest of the tournament, but Ben Crenshaw, Justin Leonard, Jordan Spieth were all Low Am.  Would joining that club mean something?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, it would mean a lot to me.  Certainly being in the Low Am here would be a tremendous honor.  I'm just going to focus on playing golf tomorrow.  I'm not going to focus on that because that's just going to kind of mess me up a little bit, I think.  I'm just going to see if I can shoot and start moving back up the leaderboard again and finish in a good spot.
