Q. With a guy safely inside the cut line, and that's Scottie Scheffler. 68, 66. What was working today to push it to 6-under?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I feel like I made a few nice par putts during the round to keep the momentum going. My swing didn't feel too great today, but got it around pretty good and made a few nice putts.
Q. What does that say about where your game is at with your recent play that a day you are battling your swing you can still shoot 66?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, feels good. Like I said, made some nice putts. I had a little chip in and got on a roll there early in the round. Just did a good job keeping the ball in play and hitting the right shots.
Q. You finished your Korn Ferry season with a flurry. Had a win, T-11, T-7. Carry that right into a top 10 finish your first start as a PGA TOUR member last week at Greenbrier. What's this stretch been like over the last month?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, it's fun being out here. Game feels like it's in good shape, so nice getting off to a good start to the season.
It's still very early. Only six rounds in. I'm in good position this weekend; see what happens.
Q. Is it starting to feel like life has started on the PGA TOUR, or since you didn't have much of an off-season you're just going one event to the next?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of one event to the next. Didn't take much time off, or didn't have an opportunity to take much time off between the finals and here. Just another stretch of golf, just more tournaments. Enjoying myself. It's been a lot of fun.
Q. I wanted to ask if it was challenging with the wind at all today, but you shot 6-under; you're 10-under par. I'm guessing you handled it pretty well.
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, game feels good. It was tough with the wind. It was a little bit windier this morning than it usually is here. That was challenging. Felt like we handled it pretty well. Hit some good shots.
Q. What did you take from last week's experience finishing in the top 10, being in the contention at the Greenbrier, and how do you think it will help you this weekend?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, it's always nice getting that experience. I played in the last group on Saturday last week. Didn't have my best stuff on te weekend, but it was definitely good experience. Hung in there pretty well to finish top 10, so it was still a solid week overall.
Q. Helps your confidence. Not that you couldn't be confident. You had a great season last year on the Korn Ferry Tour.
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Thanks, man. Like I said game, feels like it's in a good spot. Just trying to keep things rolling out here and not overthink things. Just go out and play.
