SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I'm sure it'll be a little bit weird playing without fans, but we've got to think of everyone's safety first as far as players and fans go. There's a decent amount of interaction, and if a lot of people are coming to an event, I'm sure that's how the virus can spread. I think our safety is a priority, safety of everybody. We have to take the proper precautions. I'm just glad that we'll be able to play the next few events. I think that's -- it's difficult with the NBA suspending play with one of the players getting sick, so we'll see where it goes from here. I'm sure there's a very fluid situation.
Q. With things changing in our world so quickly, how much did you think this would happen as immediately as it did?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I mean, when I woke up this morning and saw what happened last night, I think you kind of half expected -- you really don't know -- I'm not too in tune with how the virus works and all that, so you've got to trust the CDC and World Health Organization and our commissioner to make the right decisions, and I trust them.
Q. What's the biggest thing you'll have to do moving forward for the next five weeks playing on the PGA TOUR with no one else out there?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a little weird. I really don't know what to expect, and it may be like high school golf again; there's going to be nobody out there but me and my mom and dad. We'll see what it looks like going forward.
