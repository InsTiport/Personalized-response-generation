  THE MODERATOR:   The business to finalize this championship.   Skip Gist from the USGA Executive Committee here to hand the champion his trophy.
SKIP GIST:   It is my honor and pleasure to announce the 2013 Junior Amateur champion Scottie Scheffler.   Scottie, congratulations, job well done.

Q.   You told me you had been close in a lot of big tournaments, but just not able to win.   What was the difference for you today?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I played pretty well down the stretch.   In the morning round, I gave away a lot of shots and I struggled with the putting a little bit early, then I started to figure it out.

Q.   What did you figure out as it went on?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I got more used to all these cameras and all these people.   I don't think my hands have been shaking so much in all my life.

Q.   How difficult was it to play with a good friend, someone you spend a lot of time with?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It wasn't that‑‑ I mean, it was tough because we are such good friends and someone has to lose, but it was nice because (inaudible).

Q.   What does this do for you moving move forward to know that you are one of the best junior amateurs in the country? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It feels good.   It's a good way to have my first win, I guess.   It's a good spot.

Q.   How aware were you of what was going on the last couple of holes and especially right here at the last?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   What do you mean? 

Q.   With the situation with Davis and the ball moving, how aware were you? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I wasn't aware.   He called that on himself.   Takes a lot of heart to do that.

Q.   When we spoke on Friday, you talked to me about your good friend James who is battling bone cancer and you said what he's dealing with has put golf in perspective.   How much did you think about him today and how much does this mean to bring it back to him?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   He really came into my mind on 14.   That shot I hit, I got really lucky on 14.   That wedge shouldn't have been able to stay on the green, but I knew someone was looking down on me.
THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations on a great week.   Well done, my friend.   A lot of people are proud of you.   I know James is, as well.
