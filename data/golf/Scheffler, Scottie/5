  Q. What exactly did you bring to the golf course today that allowed you to beat those top players?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I brought a lot of.  I was excited to play these guys today.  I was very excited for the morning match.  I've watched Ian way too many times on TV just beat the crap out of us in the Ryder Cup.  So I just have memories of me and my dad sitting on the couch and watch this guy make putt after putt.  So it was nice to get one on him, at least for me.  But, yeah, it was a fun day.
 Q. Was Ian just another opponent to you or was it somebody you really wanted to beat considering his history?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I mean, I would say he's just another opponent, but he's a very talented guy.  Everybody's just another opponent, whether I'm -- I mean, it doesn't matter who I'm playing, I'm treating each match the same.  But I think sometimes you got to bring a little different attitude and I knew I had to bring my best stuff today, not really giving either of those guys much breathing room.  I did my best to do that.  I did give Jon a little bit on the front nine but I stepped up on the back nine to keep things in check.
 Q. When you head into tomorrow, obviously you've played a lot of golf and now two matches and you're the champion.  From an energy perspective, mentally and physically, where are you?
 SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I feel pretty good.  Obviously today was a tough day playing both those guys, but I feel like my game's in a good spot, I feel like I'm trending in a right direction as the week has gone on, so I'm excited to get back out on the course tomorrow.
