Q. When you come here as an amateur, come to a U.S. Open, what expectations do you bring in?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Well, the expectations I brought in, I was trying to compete and see if I could win the golf tournament.  I think it would be pretty cool winning the U.S. Open as an Am, and that was my goal coming in.
And as the week went on, coming into today I kind of realized I didn't really have a shot anymore, but I still wanted to play my best golf and see what I could do.
Q. When you hit that realty, as harsh as it may be, what do you do to motivate yourself to keep advancing on the leaderboard?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Well, I'm a really competitive guy, so it seems like no matter where I am in the tournament, if I miss the cut by five, I don't want to give up any shots.  That's kind of the way I've always been.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Q. Did the course play to any of your strengths or did it take away from any strengths?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I think any golf course you just play to your strengths.  One of my strengths is my work around the greens.  I like the closely mown areas around here, I thought they were pretty good, they give you a chance to be creative, and I think I used those to my advantage.
Q. What is your biggest takeaway?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: It's good getting the experience and seeing what it's like playing four days here.  And I have a lot of stuff I need to work on in my game to where I can compete to win.  Definitely taking that away.
Q. Great experience?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, great experience.  Like I said, making the cut is a good experience.  And being able to do it with Cali on the bag.  And getting able to play on Father's Day this year is definitely a lot better than watching.
Q. Tell me about your expectations going into it.
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: The U.S. Am is a little different animal, you've got 300 guys going into 64 in match play.  My goal is going to be finish as high as I can in stroke play.  And once I get in the first match, just try and start winning one match at a time.
Q. Tell me about Walker Cup, you've been close to that on a couple of occasions, how do you think this week helped your chances of making that team?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I think this week definitely helps a bunch.  Performing on a stage like this certainly couldn't hurt my chances, but that's really not up to me, it's up to the committee and the USGA.  And hopefully they'll want me to be a part of the Walker Cup, but you've got to play good.  And hopefully I'll be able to play good the rest of the summer and make my way on to the team and earn my way on.  And I think this week is a good start to that.
Q. How much would it mean to play in that event?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Representing your country in any event is special.  I've been blessed to do it several times.  To do it on the biggest stage in amateur golf would be a dream come true.  It's been a goal of mine since I figured out I had a chance about four years ago.  So always looking to that as kind of a stepping-stone, and you see the guys playing the Walker Cup, are all extremely special players and talents.  And just to be just a part of that list would be extremely special.
Q. Has your sister, Cali, caddied for you before?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: She has, many times.
Q. Any family rivalry concerning where she goes to school and where you go to school?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Not really.  I have some good buddies, got a girlfriend that goes there and my best friend from high school goes there.  Not a real rivalry.
Q. What would it mean to wind up as low Am here?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: That would be extremely special, as well.  Being an amateur in the U.S. Open is very cool.  And it's a great experience and being able to be the top amateur, to be a part of that list, as well, would definitely be really special.  And the USGA always treats amateurs and their champions really well.  To be a part of that list again would be very nice.
