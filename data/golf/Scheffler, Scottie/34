Q.   Scott tee, how exciting for you, not only do you get in, you played well.   You've qualified for the weekend. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   It feels pretty good now.   It was rough toward the end but I finished well.

Q.   What were your expectations coming into the event? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I wanted to try to get into the top‑10 so now I got a chance to do that. 

Q.   Quite a thrill for you to make that birdie on 17. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I needed that putt to go in.   I just bogeyed 15 and 16 so I needed something to go my way. 

Q.   You had 25 putts. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I only hit five fairways so I had to do something to keep my round in check. 

Q.   You had great support out there.   In fact, I think if there was a truant offer from Highland Park, he would find a bunch of your classmates out here. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   He would, but apparently they all had family issues today and came out to watch. 

Q.   Is that it?   "Family issues"?   Maybe a sudden flu epidemic with the Scotts? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Uh‑huh, that's how you get out of it, I guess. 

Q.   Your sister on the bag, how is that working out? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Working out pretty well.   She has been helpful.   She's usually pretty helpful and that hasn't changed much. 

Q.   Four years ago, Jordan Spieth was here and we were wondering if he was going to be able to make his high school prom that night.   That's not a factor for you? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   No, we already had prom.   Good to go. 

Q.   Talk about your round, how it went.   What was working well? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I started off pretty well.   I was 4‑under through 7, I had a chip‑in.   My putter felt good so that was helpful and I wasn't hitting the ball good but my short game felt solid, so I was able to keep my round going in the right direction. 

Q.   Feel comfortable out here? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, felt more comfortable today than I did yesterday, so that's good. 

Q.   You hit five fairways, you said? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Only five fairways. 

Q.   Off on the driver? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   They were going all over the place.   I think that's why I finally started playing bad toward the end.   I was just kind of surviving toward the beginning and the wheels came off a little bit at the end. 

Q.   Talk about playing this weekend. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, it should be pretty fun.   Never played the weekend before, and maybe I'll be less comfortable out there, I'm not really sure but should be fun. 

Q.   Less comfortable? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah. 

Q.   You were 7‑under through a 12‑hole stretch during the first two rounds.   What was going good for you? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   My putter was working well.   It hasn't quite left me throughout the tournament, but I was really putting well and I hit some good shots, too. 

Q.   The chip‑in on 3 looked good all the way.   Did you have a good feeling about it? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I had a good line on it.   It was just about getting it the right distance.   I left myself in a good spot. 

Q.   That's a bonus on that hole?
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, it is, especially where I hit my drive, it could have been a tough hole for me. 

Q.   Scottie, what do you think you've proven to yourself these first two days? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I think I've proven a lot, because I really haven't been hitting fairways, which was my goal, and just keep the ball in play, see what I could do.   But I haven't been doing that, and I still played pretty decent so that gives me a lot of confidence. 

Q.   Did you sleep better last night than the night before? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   I actually slept well both nights.   I was worn out last night when I got home, and Thursday I got to sleep in.   It wasn't too bad. 

Q.   How about dealing with this stuff, the media stuff. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   This is new for me, I'm used to one recorder, not ‑‑ how many out here, six or seven?   It's different. 

Q.   I was watching you on No. 7, looked like you were watching the scoreboard. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I was playing pretty well and I've been looking at the scoreboard anyways but I wanted to see how far I climbed up the leaderboard. 

Q.   Did you see you got to T‑10? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   No, I didn't know that.   I was playing pretty well, so doesn't‑‑

Q.   Doesn't shock you at all that you were going to be in the Top‑10?   You said you wanted to finish there. 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, I wanted to finish there, and I lost some, so I've got to gain some back, but built up some momentum there. 

Q.   Do you feel like you belong out here? 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER:   Yeah, feeling more comfortable.   Definitely more comfortable today than yesterday.
