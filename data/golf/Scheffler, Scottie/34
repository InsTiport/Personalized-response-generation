 Q.  Expectations for you the rest of the week, shooting an incredible round of the day.  You have three more rounds to go.  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Three more rounds to go. We need to get a game plan going for the next round.  We'll see where the lead is at.  My game plan isn't going to change too much.  Try to get the ball in play and see what I can do on the fairways out here.  It's not easy to play from the rough and the bad spots around this course.   
 Q.  Jordan Spieth not that much older than you.  Did you get a chance to chat with him, play a practice round with him, get insight from a guy that's already won this championship?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I was lucky enough to play nine holes with Jordan, Zach Johnson and William McGirt Wednesday morning.  That was really, really helpful.  Zach showed me spots around the greens.  Jordan also helped out and then William actually helped me out with the spikes, my shoes.  I was kind of slipping around.  I have to thank him whenever he's done, wherever he is.   
 Q.  Great round today.  Good luck the rest of the week.  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Thank you.
