 Q.  Sitting at 13-under par through two rounds; only one bogey on your card. How much confidence does that give you that the game is sharp from top to bottom?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, definitely good amount of confidence. Feel like my ball striking has been good the last few days. I haven't put myself in too many bad situations.   
Just hoping to keep that going for the weekend.   
 Q.  I followed you all year on the Korn Ferry Tour. You were the combined points leader; fully exempt on the PGA TOUR. Again, what did you learn and how much confidence does that give you to perform at the highest level and carry over to this week?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Definitely a lot of confidence from this year. It was a good year, solid year. Felt like we learned a lot. It's a lot different playing week to week. Coming from college we only play a few events a year, so definitely week to week was a bit of an adjustment. I think that suits me a little better. Doesn't really give my too much time to I would say overthink things, kind of practice too much.   
I'm more of a guy that likes to go out and play. I feel like the adjustment was pretty simple.   
 Q.  We see the success of Morikawa, Wolff. Does it give you extra belief of what it possible at such an early age?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, for sure. Those guys came out and killed it this summer, and it was a lot of fun for us to watch. Definitely gives us a lot of confidence coming into this year knowing we can come compete pretty much immediately.   
 Q.  Nice day out there. Just get some comments on your round.  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, I felt like I got off to a really good start, which definitely helps. Made a few nice putts at the beginning of the round and ball striking was really sold again today, so I had plenty of looks. Pretty stress-free so far.   
 Q.  Strokes gained putting yesterday was 130th; you're currently in the Top 5. Was there an adjustment you made from round one to round two?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Yeah, definitely. Can't really make that big of a jump otherwise.   
Just a little something in my setup I figured out.   
 Q.  What specifically in the setup?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I gave myself a little more room in my chest, let the arms flow a little bit more. Pretty simple. Not anything major. Just a little bit of a feel thing.   
Apparently worked today, so felt good.   
 Q.  When you birdie your first four holes do you start to think really low number or does that relax you a little bit?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: No, I try not to overthink things. It was nice getting off to a good start. Made some really good putts there at the beginning. Just wanted to keep hitting quality shots and getting a lot of looks, which I did a good job of today.
