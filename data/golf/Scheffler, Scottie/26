 Q.  Not a bad bogey-free round today. What went well for you?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: I feel like I putted pretty solid today, I had a few nice up-and-downs. My swing didn't feel awesome, but I got it around pretty good on the course.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the eagle you had on the front?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: That was nice. I got off to a little rocky start, made a nice par on 4 and a really good birdie on 5 and then hit two good shots into 6 and made like a nice 20-footer there, it was a good hole.   
 Q.  Your first start of the new calendar year after a pretty great fall, how does it feel to be back playing competitive golf?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: Good. It's fun. Yeah, I missed playing. Took a nice off season, but missed playing so glad to be back.   
 Q.  I know it's early but how does it feel to be in contention and in the mix?  
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER: It's real early. Had the easiest course today, so I still got a lot of work the next few days.
