   WILL MacKENZIE: I'm bummed that I didn't shoot a better score, but it is what it is. I'm not totally out of the tournament.   
 I wanted to at least be in the tournament on Sunday. Last time I was in contention after two days, I wasn't going into the final day. It was two years ago.   
  
  Q. How hard has it been since you did that, what you were talking about the other day?   
 WILL MacKENZIE: I haven't heliboarded since '99, but I snowboarded last winter.   
  
  Q. Do you still do the kayaking?   
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah, but I was hurting my shoulder really bad.
