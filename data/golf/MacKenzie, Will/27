 Q. Talk about your round today. Conditions were not ideal but you were able to make some nice things happen out there. 
 WILL MacKENZIE: It's nice to come back to Florida. The golf course is in phenomenal shape. I enjoy playing here. I played here on the mini-tours, on the Golden Bear Tour. I like the golf course a lot. 
 It blows like this all the time in Florida, so I'm sort of used to it. You know, it can go either way. You can make a big score any time out here. So today, I was fortunate. Hopefully I can keep it going for the rest of the week.

 Q. You have a little home-course advantage going on, as well. How nice is that to be in your own bed and play in familiar surroundings?
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah, that's the key, sleeping in my own bed, playing a course I've played 50 times, playing on familiar grass, bermudagreens, they are not really overseeded; it's just really nice to be back home.

 Q. So if it stays like this, what's it going to take to win this tournament? 
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah, probably under 10-under for sure. 
 The rough is not as bad this year, so if you are driving it a little funky, you might get away with it, but you can still draw some really bad lies out there. 
 You know, it's just going to get tougher and tougher. The greens are going to get a little firmer. They were pretty receptive today, and when they get firm, it's going to be a little dicey.
