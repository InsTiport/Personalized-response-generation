 Q. How old's your other child?
 WILL MacKENZIE: 15 and a half months.
 
 Q. Oh, wow.
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
 Q. You kept the assembly line going.
 WILL MacKENZIE: Well, she's not as far along as you think. She's due -- we're going to have another baby February 26th. I think she's due March 13th, but we're just going to do a C-section on February 26th. Or she's going to do it.
 
 Q. I was going to say, what's this we thing?
 WILL MacKENZIE: I'm going to be sitting on the sidelines chilling.
 
 Q. Anything significant to that date?
 WILL MacKENZIE: No. But it is -- the 26th is just where it fell. Our son was born on July 26th, so I got a bad memory, and I'll able to remember they were both on the 26th. I'm like, what are you born on? July. You just gotta remember the month.
 
 Q. Still keeping your head still?
 WILL MacKENZIE: Not really today. I mean I did it some. You know, I did it probably about 40%. 60% I was moving over it.
 So the reason I shot such a good score is I had a couple kick-ins, and I did make a couple good putts. So I'll work on it.
 
 Q. Are you as good yet at golf as you were some of this other crazy stuff that you did over the years?
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah, probably.
 
 Q. Was it like kayaking and -- not wake boarding.
 WILL MacKENZIE: Snowboarding.
 
 Q. You were out there --
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah. But I wasn't doing it for money, but I mean out here I don't seem that good, these guys are beating my brains here. But I get them every now and then. I'm graduating.
 
 Q. Gio said you're like a sponge sometimes. You'll see somebody on the driving range, Charlie Wi stacking and tilting and five minutes later you're stacking and tilting and somebody else does it. You'd kind of do it left-handed if you have to.
 WILL MacKENZIE: Yeah. As I told you when I started back playing and when I got on TOUR in 2005, I used to watch The Golf Channel every day. I mean I was getting tips and stuff.
 So you know, I just took a long time off. I like to -- you know, I mean I just like to see what people are doing, and if I can vibe off of it, I can figure it out, I can do something they're doing to help me, I like to use it, to my detriment.
