  Q. Two days in a row. You got to be fired up about your position heading into Sunday.  
 WILL MACKENZIE: Yeah, I'm really excited. Leaving a little bit with a bad taste in my mouth making bogey. Played my way into it, I guess.   
 The guys -- I guess the guys could get to 16 or 18-under or something, but I still have a chance, somewhere in there where if I shot like a great round tomorrow I possibly could win the golf tournament.   
 I haven't had that chance all year. It's always inspiring. Hopefully I can stay with that nice flow I've got. I'm hitting it good enough probably to even make more birdies so hopefully I can get it done tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Just a crazy tournament. You find yourself watching the scoreboard or you can't because it's forever changing?  
 WILL MACKENZIE: It's one of those things -- I'm keeping an eye on the head guys just to know like how low they're going but, you know, that if you're not shooting -- if you're not shooting 5-under today you're toast. That's just the way it is. It's too soft out there.  
  
  Q. What would it mean to win here? You have lot of family and friends following you.  
 WILL MACKENZIE: Yes, to win here or Charlotte, one day, it would mean the world to the few fans I have here in North Carolina and my family and to me, especially, to win a home state event.   
 Not really in contention here at Forest Oaks but I had a good finish there and, you know, just be wonderful. It's nice to be in the mix, you know, coming down on Sunday.  
  
  Q. Good luck tomorrow.
