 Q.  You just won the AT&T Byron Nelson a week ago.  Great momentum coming in.  What's been working, what has transpired into Bethpage Black?  
SUNG KANG: I obviously played really well last week and I won the tournament, so I really try to be as calm as I can be, because I have to play another event this week and I have next week off, so I can have a celebration next week.  I pushed it back a little bit because I'm really trying to concentrate on playing this week.   
 Q.  What worked for you today?  Obviously solid driving is key; accuracy and distance.  
SUNG KANG: I hit it a lot better than yesterday off the tee and irons was a lot better, and I hit a lot of great putts.  Just lipped-out about five times and made a couple short ones.  Putting, I didn't put -- just didn't drop any today.  I stayed patient.  It's a hard course.  It's a major.   
 Q.  Since you won last week, and that takes a lot of emotion, takes a lot of mental energy, how are you going to prepare for this weekend coming up?  
SUNG KANG: I'll just do the same thing.  I mean, I played early morning today, so I'm going to do a little bit of practice and work out and then the rest of the day, I'm just going to rest, take some nap.  I don't think I'm really fully back from last week yet, so I'm just going to try to rest.
