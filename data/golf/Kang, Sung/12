 Q.  I know it was a difficult day for you out there.  Just comment on the week as a whole first.  
SUNG KANG: You know, this week going to be very memorable for me.  I played really solid the first few rounds and then it shifted for two rounds.  Just -- Russell just played it like great.  He played like the first two days was just like me, like I did the first two rounds.  He putted really well, made almost everything.  Then I had a chance coming in on 16, the par-3, hit a 7-footer and had a -- he makes it and I missed and I think that was it.  That was the turning point.  Yeah, I'll keep grinding out and working out and hopefully I can get a chance in the next time for myself.   
 Q.  Was it difficult to try and keep pace with him rolling in so many birds?  
SUNG KANG: He's been putting really well since last time, yesterday and last few days, and then I haven't been putting really well, not like the first two rounds.  That was the big key, I think, the putting.   
 Q.  You had so many positive things happen to you this week.  Going to be hard to remember those because of the disappointment in not winning?  
SUNG KANG: I think I still did okay.  I didn't play that well, but I still hung in there.  And Russell played great today.  The weather was not that good, and plus I'm going to have a little bit less pressure for my season this year, so it was a good week.
