 Q.  Great playing today.  A few back going into the final round.  Just curious of your thoughts.  
SUNG KANG: Today the wind was blowing a little bit and the greens are really firm today, so it was a little bit tough conditions.  I tried to play very conservatively and then I think I played all right.  I missed a couple short putts, but still finished all right.  2-under is not bad for Saturday.  And I'll just try to do the same thing depends on how the weather is.  If the weather is good, we'll play more aggressively.  If the weather is bad, like today, we'll play a little more safe.  We'll see how it is tomorrow and I'll just try my best.   
 Q.  The front nine is known as the more gettable nine.  How will you approach that tomorrow?  
SUNG KANG: Actually there's some easy holes on the front nine, but there are some hard holes if the wind is blowing in the same direction as like today.  So it all depends on the wind, all depends on the conditions.   
But greens are very firm, so it is very hard to hit it straight at the flag right now.  So, I basically, I'm going to try to go for middle of the green and try to have a 15 or 20-footer and hopefully make some putts tomorrow.   
 Q.  Being in contention, you're rather new to being in contention on the PGA TOUR, what does it mean to have somebody like Fluff on the bag?  
SUNG KANG: Oh, you know what, yeah, I'm in contention right now.  And he is a veteran, so nobody's -- he's been doing it so long, so I think that that definitely helps.  He's going to calm me down a little bit.  I think that's going to help a lot tomorrow.
