Q. You are now the second person to come in today tying the course record with a 64.  How is the course playing out there?
SUNG KANG: The course is less breezy and the greens are kind of soft, and I started early in the morning.  Then I was hitting a lot of fairways, different from the last couple days, which I've worked on.  It just worked out great.
I mean, plus, when I was in the short grass, I hit my irons really beautifully and nicely today.  So that's why I had a lot of opportunities to make some birdies and putted well, too.  I'm just happy with what I shot today.  I hit it good.
Q. You were 122 in the FedExCup rankings, so feeling fantastic heading into next week now?
SUNG KANG: I've still got to wait a little bit till they finish.  I actually booked a flight back to my house yesterday.  I was really thinking after today, just go to New York and have some vacation and go back home and rest.  But yeah, first thing, I had a great day today and looking forward to play next week.
