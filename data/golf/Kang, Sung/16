 Q.  A bird there on the 9th to get to 9-under.  How you feel for the weekend?  
SUNG KANG: All day I drove the ball really well today, and I putted really well.  I had couple putts to make pars, and I made both of them.   
I'm really pleased to have this opportunity for next two rounds.  I just had fun.  It's really fun out here.   
 Q.  You talked about momentum and ball striking today.  The momentum, to make the birdies you made, you had to be pretty close to the hole.  
SUNG KANG: I short-sighted myself a couple of times, hit it about 10 feet.  Had a couple of 10-feet par putts and made both of them, like on 18 today and then -- I don't know.  Another one somewhere.  I think that actually make me keep playing better.   
 Q.  You mentioned it being fun out here.  9-under after two rounds.  Talk about the experience with the fans out here and how they have been treating you.  
SUNG KANG: Not just for me.  I can't really hear that much, which is good, I think.  Even on 16, I wasn't really paying too much attention what the people were doing and I didn't care.  I think that kind of helped me.   
It will be crazier tomorrow, but I think it will still be the same, just keep playing like I have been playing today and it will be just fine.   
 Q.  Speaking of tomorrow, you have a little bit of time this afternoon.  Will you work out?  
SUNG KANG: I will go practice a little bit and work out and have some nice dinner and come back out and have fun again.
