 Q.  Tell me about your round today.  
AUSTIN ERNST: Pretty solid.  I didn't quite hit it as close maybe as the first couple days.  Had a lot of putts lip out; had a chip lip out.   
Just solid golf, especially coming down the stretch.  Pretty demanding on the shot you got to hit on 16, the shot you got to hit on 18.   
So wish I would've made a couple more of those putts, but it was a solid day.  It was kind of one of those where I knew I was going to have to shoot a low one to throw a number up there and give them something to look at.   
Figured if I get it to 13 and kind of get her to looking at 13 or 14, then coming down, but maybe we'll see 11.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Considering your past finishes here, how happy are you with the way you played today?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Very.  Yeah, I don't have a good track record out here at all.  I played really solid this week and I'm excited for the last -- I think I've got four left, the last four that I'm playing the rest of the year.   
 Q.  Does that give lot of confidence?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Oh, yeah.  I mean, just how I've been playing all here, and then today, a major championship, coming down the stretch and hitting the shots I hit on 16, hit a great shot on 15 -  almost made the eagle putt - and then hit a great shot on 18, hit a great drive, great shot, and just didn't quite read that putt right.   
But shows what I'm capable of.  I kind of knew it already.  To do it, you kind of prove to yourself even more.
