Q. Do you think seeing Lambeau up close like that had anything to do with the first round score today?
AUSTIN ERNST: In all seriousness, no.  (Laughter.)
Q. That was a serious...
AUSTIN ERNST: It was cool though, yeah.
Q. Yeah.  So not often when you shoot 7-under and you're still three back of the lead the first day.
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, and not too often that you feel like you -- I left quite a few out there actually.
I hit the ball pretty well; I just missed few shorter putts.  Made a long one on 16 to kind of -- feel like I stole one a little bit.
But, yeah, I mean, the greens are so soft and the pins overall were pretty generous today where you could definitely take advantage.
Q. Still bogey-free for you, right?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah.
Q. Not like you made too many mistakes.
AUSTIN ERNST: No.  I mean, if I made a mistake I -- I almost chipped in twice.  Both greens I missed almost I almost chipped the ball in and just had a little tap-in.
I just had a lot of control of the ball today.  Out here when you have that, you can just go at every pin.
I don't think any pin I hit aimed more than ten feet away from it all day, so...
Q. Is it easy to relax when everyone seems to be scoring and you kind of just ride this wave into the weekend?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I kind of knew.  Starting the day I looked at the pins and I kind of knew you can make a lot of birdies.  It can go the other way, too, where if you don't make birdies you can get frustrated easier.
I kind of came into this week just trying not to care too much and just trying to have fun.  That's kind of my mentality for the week.  That's when I play my best.  So that's my thing for the week that I'm doing.
Q. What are you going to do for fun tonight?
AUSTIN ERNST: Going to go get some food and go to sleep.  (Laughter.)
