 Q.  Not a lot of low scores; is it windy?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Pretty windy out there and then a few of the pins are kind of in kind of tough spots if you get it on the wrong side of the hole.  But I hit it pretty well all day.  Gave myself a lot of looks.  Made a lot of good putts.  A lot of good pars.   
Bogeyed 1 and really from there on, I played really solid.   
 Q.  So just put the bogey behind and get going?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, made a bad swing on 1.  Hit a big hole left of the green and didn't hit a very good chip and hit it to about three feet on No. 2 and hit it to six inches on three to kind of get that right back.  And then just kind of continued to play solid.   
 Q.  Everyone says these greens, they are just huge.  You were here last year; undulations and all the good stuff, take a lot of studying?  Does it take a lot of knowing where to put it?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Here and there.  There's a few pins where you've got to hit -- like there's one on 13 today that we were trying to hit it ten feet right of the hole because if you got it left of the hole, if you got left, you'd have a really hard up-and-down.   
I had pretty good control of my irons all day coming in from the fairway.  So I can still be aggressive but there are definitely pins you've kind of got to play to a side where you might have to hit it five or ten feet left or right of the pin because if you hit it on the other side, you're going to have a really tough up-and-down.   
 Q.  Finishing off the season, if you get a really good -- just looking at the projections for CME, what's the goal the next four events?  Is it to get in the top nine, just play solid?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I have three left.  I have this week and then Lorena and CME.  So obviously coming into Asia the last -- I guess it would be six weeks, I wanted to get at least one win.  I felt like my game was there.  And then I've had -- I've just been sloppy the first three weeks.  I've had decent rounds that I've let get away from me where I shoot a couple over instead of shooting a couple under.   
Every week, I've had a good round.  Even Korea, I played awful the first three days, shot 5-under the last day.  It's been close.  It's been one of those, it's been three frustrating weeks.  I felt like I got a good bit out of it today.  Actually could have made two or three more putts.  But it was a solid round, solid way to get started.   
 Q.  What have you been working on in the past three weeks?  Have you been able to do anything at the range or anything?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Haven't been doing too much.  I think more just execution a little bit.  And then just making a few more putts.  Putting has been a little -- putting and chipping have been a little sloppy.  So spent a little bit of time on that on Tuesday and really just took it easy this week, being the fourth week in a row.  Played the Pro-Am yesterday and that was the first time I saw the course all week is the Pro-Am yesterday.   
 Q.  You took Monday and Tuesday off?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I took Monday completely off and I putted and chipped on Tuesday.  Kind of needed a little rest after.  But yeah, it's close.   
 Q.  Would you have done that the past two years?  Did you go to Asia your rookie year?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I went three weeks.  I think seeing the course helps a lot.  I played it last year and then obviously Drew went and walked.  He goes, say, nothing's really changed; this tee, that tee.  But yeah, in my rookie year, I probably wouldn't have done that.  Last year, you just kind of knew -- I played four weeks in a row last year over here, too.  You kind of know the course and you kind of know what you can handle.  Sometimes it's better just to go take it easy and go play and not really get anything out of it.   
 Q.  What did you do Tuesday and Monday?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Monday was a pool day.  Tuesday was a chipping and putting and basically hang out day.
