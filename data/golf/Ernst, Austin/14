Q. I know the score was kind of the same as yesterday.  But was the play any better for you today?
AUSTIN ERNST: It was more putting today.  Just couldn't get any putts to fall.  Left them short a lot beginning of the round, and then kind of just couldn't ever get any momentum.
Any time I hit a pretty good shot -- you know, two-putted on 5 for birdie, and then after that, every time I hit a pretty good shot, it seemed like I didn't get the putt to the hole and didn't make it.  Just couldn't really get anything going.
And then, you know, made, I guess, the back nine, I had maybe -- I guess on 14, hit it in the back bunker and couldn't get it up and down.  Hit a bad iron shot on 17 and three-putted it, but I didn't have much of a chance to get close on that one.
Q. Austin, as a South Carolina native, how special was it to compete in South Carolina?
AUSTIN ERNST: It was awesome.  I hope we get another Major sometime soon.  It was fun seeing all the people coming out and following me, being able to have friends and family follow me that haven't seen me play either in a while or ever.
I think it was really cool.  I think the golf course was really good.  I think it showcased the state really well.  So hopefully, we can get something back, if not here, somewhere else.
But it's been awesome being back in South Carolina.  I haven't played a tournament in the state in eight years.  So it was really cool.
Q. If they asked you, you would suggest having another Major here?
AUSTIN ERNST: I think it's held up well.  They've gotten the greens really firm and fast, and it's been a really good test.  It will be interesting to see what the winning score is, but I think it's been a really good test of golf all week.
I think it could host something again.
