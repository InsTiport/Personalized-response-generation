 Q.  All smiles this morning when I talked to you.  Once again, what are your emotions at the moment?  
PAULA CREAMER: I still can't get over that chip shot that she made.  Oh, my gosh.  Moments like that are just so cool to be just a part of, to watch, to witness.  When you're good, you're good, and she just came in right at the right time with that.   
It just was pivotal.  And it's pretty awesome.  Two points now for the rookie, which is awesome.  And it's just such a good feeling.  I just want to keep going.  I'm glad we're done, but I do want to keep going.   
 Q.  "Awesome" is a pretty appropriate word to describe the Solheim Cup for you guys right now, Austin?  
AUSTIN ERNST: That was so much fun today.  Yeah, I don't even have any words for it.  Like, it was awesome.   
PAULA CREAMER: Awesome, keyword.   
 Q.  Paula, you've been coming here for years, you know what the Solheim Cup means.  But coming up here, obviously getting the late call-up, in your heart and soul, what is it about the Solheim Cup that brings out the absolute best for you?  
PAULA CREAMER: Oh, man, I don't know.  I love being on the team.  I thrive off of it.  I thrive off of the crowd.  You know, when you have to hit big shots at big moments, I want to be the one to do it.   
And I just I love it.  I love having a partner.  And it was just such a good time.  We have fun whether we're up or down and that's the key.   
 Q.  How special is it to be alongside this one?  
AUSTIN ERNST: It's awesome.  She's a great partner.  She carried me a little bit today.  And then I let her hop on it for a little bit.  But we were a great team.
