 Q.  How did you feel out there today?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Pretty good.  Felt like I left a few out there, but it was a pretty easy day.  Pretty similar to yesterday.  Probably didn't have quite as many looks as I did yesterday, but I shot 3-under and I played the par-5s even.   
 Q.  Today?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, today.  So I think yesterday I shot 6 and I played the par-5s 3-under yesterday.  Really just wish I would've played those a little better.  I had to make about a 20-footer for par on 5 and drove it in the water.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
AUSTIN ERNST: Made it really easy on myself; hit a lot of greens.  More of that tomorrow should be good.   
 Q.  Did you can you curl one in the side door there on 18?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, it kind of went in like inside of right.  Didn't hit a great chip.  Kind of misjudged it and thought it might check for me a little bit, and then just kind of released.   
Yeah, I don't know what Brooke is going to do here on 18, but I'll be four, five back if she makes birdie.  Just got to go chase tomorrow.   
 Q.  You think that's a comfortable range to be in?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I would've liked to have gotten it closer.  I wanted to shoot 7 or 8 today and get it 13 or 14, which would've ended up being right around the lead.   
 Q.  Right.  
AUSTIN ERNST: But, you know, I'll shoot as low as I can and we'll see what she does.   
 Q.  Do you like that, chasing?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I don't mind it.  When I won here I was chasing.  I don't know if I was two or three back, but I can make a lot of birdies.  Especially out here I know I can make a lot of birdies, so it's just a matter of getting a few to fall early and kind of get into a nice little rhythm.
