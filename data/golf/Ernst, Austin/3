  Q. First, congratulations.  (Applause interference - regarding 13th hole.)
 AUSTIN ERNST:   13 I just told myself -- I had hit it a good putt on 12 and I was still 3-under for the day.  Just still believed and I was still playing good.  Just made a bad swing on 12 and, and then the shot on 13 just kind of went a little higher than I thought.  The wind killed it and I hit a good putt there too.
 And then walked to 14 and Drew just told me, Hey, you're playing great.  Just keep doing what you want to do and let's just make a few birdies coming in.  Didn't make any birdies, but played well coming in, and that made it easy coming in there.
 Q. Zach from LPGA media just interviewed Danielle Kang and she said you played a different course than the rest of us this week.  Is that a testament to the type of game you're capable of playing?
 AUSTIN ERNST:   Yeah, I think the difference this week even just the last week was I just fully committed to believing in what I do and that it's good enough.  I think this week proved that it's more than good enough.  It was fun to walk up and know that I was going to win.  I haven't had that yet, so that was fun.
 Q. You have a lot of support, welcomed you with open arms up in in Richmond.  Your dad and mom just made their way back there.  What do you say to all of those supporters gathered right now for all the loyal support and guidance they've given you?
 AUSTIN ERNST:   It's unbelievable.  I feel like everywhere I go I have people that just reach out to me and support me any way they can.  They go above and beyond back home in (indiscernible) in Richmond, Palm Beach.  I'm very thankful to have some really good people in my life and that makes these a lot more fun because you have a lot people to celebrate with.
