 Q.  Okay.  A 4-under start for you.  What was working well for you? How did you feel about your round?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Played really well.  I got a lot of good looks at birdie.  Actually lipped out a lot of putts.  So it was really just getting a lot of looks at birdie, and then rolling a few in.   
But I made it pretty easy on myself.  Kind of hit the fairway or just off the fairway and hit a bunch of greens, which is what you need to do out here.  Hit it actually relatively close in the right quadrants out here.   
 Q.  How did you find the greens were playing today?  
AUSTIN ERNST: They are rolling really well.  I actually hit a few putts way too hard, and then just made the comebackers.  They are not -- they are not firm this year, so you can get at a lot of pins, which is nice, because you can actually be really aggressive.   
 Q.  You've played well here in the past, pretty much every year you've had a Top-25.  What is it about this tournament you like and what about the golf course?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I love this golf course.  I think it's a ball-striker's course.  And then I just know -- you know, I know the golf course really well.  This is my fourth year here.  Yeah, there's something about it that I really like, so I hope we keep coming back.   
But yeah, got good memories, too, which is always nice.  When you stand on greens, you know you made a bunch of birdies.  Kind of at the beginning of the week, you kind of are in a good mind-set.
