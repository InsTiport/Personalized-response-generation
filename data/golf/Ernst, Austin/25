Q. Great round today.  Little hot out there.  Could you talk to us about your round?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, it was really solid.  Wish I could have got a few of those last four, especially where I hit it on 17.  I had a couple good looks coming in.  But it was a solid day.  Hit the ball well on the back nine, and then had the putter going pretty good.  That just kind of kept my momentum early.  I wasn't hitting the ball nearly as well the first five holes, and then kind of got it going there in the middle of the round.
Q. You had to scramble a little bit there on 18 to kind of save par, kind of a crazy hole.  What were your emotions like there?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I hit it in the worst spot you could possibly hit it.  I knew walking up it wasn't going to be good, just being on that hard pin.  I was really happy I made that five-footer, I would have been a little more mad if I hadn't.  Yeah, it was a good save.  You just kind of know with that pin you can't hit it over there, and I knew as soon as I hit that second shot it wasn't going to be too good.
Q. Obviously, you need some help from Brooke and whatnot, but Top 5, how do you feel right now?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I feel good about it.  I definitely feel like I could have posted a little bit lower score.  I was hoping to get it to 14 or 15, and kind of give her something to look at, since I saw she was already at 14.  It was something to think about kind of coming down the stretch.  But we'll see how it all shakes out.
I don't think it's going to be good for a win.  But it was a really solid week, and I love this golf course.  I feel like it suits my game well, and that's why I always like coming back here.
Q. To make this run today on Sunday, what was the difference for today, the heat, being from the south, do you thrive in something like that?
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, I think I just hit some good iron shots kind of middle of the round, and I capitalized on a lot of them.  The putter saved me kind of on 1.  Hit a good chip on 3, that kind of thing.  But I was just confident coming down the stretch.  I knew I've been in this situation before, so I knew that I could go make a few more birdies.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get those putts to fall on 15, 16, 17.
But, yeah, it's good.  It's good to be back in the hunt and get those nerves flowing a little bit.
Q. What does it say about your round that you only had one bogey?
AUSTIN ERNST: I think it was just solid.  Really, after No. 5, I was never really in a situation where I was going to make bogey other than I kind of hammered the putt on 15.  18 was the closest I came to making another bogey.  So I hit a lot of greens coming in and just made it easy on myself.
