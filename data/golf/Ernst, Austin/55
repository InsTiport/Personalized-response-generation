  THE MODERATOR: Happy to be joined in the media center by defending champion, Austin Ernst, Austin, how does it feel to be back as defending champ?   
AUSTIN ERNST: It's great. It's been nice to have what I've gotten out of the past year, coming back, the volunteers, and the fans that have been out so far this week, especially to come back to this place too. It's the home of my first win, so I have a lot of good memories out here.  
   
 Q. Speaking of the first win, what's gone into this week? It has to be a little more obviously coming back as defending champion.   
AUSTIN ERNST: It is. Monday I had an event with First Tee, which was cool to do. Then we had something with the USGA having the Women's Am here. We had a reception downtown. Kind of cool having both events in the same city. Then last night I was at the Pro‑Am party. But I've tried to shut off some time to get some work in.   
I played nine holes yesterday. The course is in great shape again, so I'm excited to go and play the Pro‑Am this afternoon and see how all 18.  
   
 Q. Do you have a lasting memory of last year's win? Is there one thing that kind of sticks out to you about your victory last season?   
AUSTIN ERNST: I mean, the scene on 18 would be what stands out the most. Chipping in on 5 was kind of a big moment for me. Making that long putt on 14, but it was just kind of the entire thing. I can remember the entire round. I can remember what shots I hit, where I hit it, all the birdies I made. But definitely the scene on 18 with Susie and Amy coming out and showering me with water, that stands out a lot, and then celebrating along with my brother.  
   
 Q. (Indiscernible) how was it seeing all the pictures in the gateway?   
AUSTIN ERNST: I haven't yet. But it's cool to see it. It's getting better every day that I'm out here. I know a few players had some fun with that, taking pictures with it. I'm playing with Jessica the next two days. She took a picture of it last night. It's cool to see. It's cool to see the pictures of the trophy. I saw pictures throughout the week, but just helps bring back those memories.  
   
 Q. And does winning here change what you expect out of yourself or how you view yourself on Tour?   
AUSTIN ERNST: I think it just gave me more confidence. Through the rest of the year after I won, I had a really solid end of the season, throughout the Asian swing, I played well there. I felt like I played better this year. I've gotten better as the last year has progressed.   
So I think just being able to draw back on that win, drawing back, knowing that I can win out here and get it done, that definitely helps every time I've been in contention so far this year, and even when I'm not, I know that I can throw out a low round and get that kind of back door top 10.   
But, yeah, I definitely had high expectations for myself before I won last year, and then now I think that bar is kind of raised just because I know what I can accomplish.  
   
 Q. (Indiscernible)?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I think I just see lines off the tees really well. The greens always roll really well, so I don't have to make a lot of putts. If I put a good stroke on it and know the ball's not really going to hop or anything. And then I think just having those rounds to kind of draw back on last year. I know in that final round, knowing that I had shot 62 the year before, I knew that I could go low and when I made a run on the front nine I knew that I could keep going low.   
So I think just knowing that in the back of my mind, knowing I can make a lot of birdies out here, it just helps whenever I step up on tees because I know I've made birdie on pretty much every hole out here.  
   
 Q. Of course you're feeling so confident, and Solheim Cup points are cutting off in a few weeks. You have to feel good to prove what you can do in the next couple of events?   
AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, it's nice coming back with that being done after these two weeks, knowing that I'm at a course where I've played well before and I'm comfortable at, so it's kind of nice. Hopefully, I'll be able to make a run these next few weeks and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q. (Indiscernible)?  
AUSTIN ERNST: It's definitely had its ups and downs. I felt like if I could just make a few more putts a tournament or if I could make one more a day, then it would be a really, really good year. I'm feeling better than I was coming into this tournament last year. I wasn't having a very good season coming here last year, definitely been more solid. I've had a lot of top 15s. I've had a lot where I've been one shot out of the top 10.   
It's been pretty solid. It's basically just been getting putts going in every day and having that consistency as opposed to maybe getting three solid rounds and then having a round that's better on even par, 1‑over or whatever it is, where it just kind of holds me back from getting in the winner's circle again.   
But, yeah, it's definitely been more solid recently. Kind of beginning‑middle half of the year I missed a few putts. But my game's definitely trending in the right direction. I like where it's headed for the rest of the season.
