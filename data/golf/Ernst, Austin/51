 Q.  That has to be weird looking at the leaderboard, seeing that, but I'm sure you'll take it?  
AUSTIN ERNST: All things considered, I started off pretty bad.  Didn't make -- 2 through 4, I just made a few bad swings, and then just kind of got, didn't hit very good chips to be able to get it up-and-down.   
After that, I actually played really good after 4.  Made a good up-and-down on 5.  I didn't hit many greens at all today.  I think I hit about seven greens.  Then nice putt on 6.  That hole was playing hard.  Made a nice birdie there.   
 Q.  How long was that?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Ten feet, 12 feet.  And then really, hit it to about two feet on 13, and then those were basically the highlights.  Other than that, it was just up-and-downs.  It was just a grind, basically.   
 Q.  Mentally draining?  
AUSTIN ERNST: You know, we were talking about it in the middle of the round, I turned to Drew, I think we were on 10 and it was just one of those days where I never really got down on myself even though I wasn't playing well.   
The next two days, it's going to have to be the same thing.  You just have to be positive.  You're going to hit shots that aren't good, and obviously with the wind and everything, it's going to look awful, maybe.  But you've just got to kind of keep plugging along, and obviously a lot of people are making bogeys.   
Today I saw Suzann played unbelievable, shot 3-under, but other than that, like not many scores under par.   
 Q.  Were you watching the leaderboard?  
AUSTIN ERNST: Here and there.  But I was playing with Janet, and she had it going at the beginning of the round.  She was 7-under through four or five.  She was playing really well, and then it was really one of those things where we all kind of had our holes where it could get away from you.   
But yeah, you really have to hit it solid in the wind, and then the greens are firm.  They are starting to bake out even more with the wind.  Downwind, especially, you've got to be really careful.   
 Q.  How many holes were you taking the wind into full consideration or changing clubs or distances?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I never really had to change clubs, I don't think, but every hole, you're thinking, okay, well, it's playing -- I've got, like on 17, we had 156 hole and we're trying to land it front edge.  It's four on the green and it's playing ten yard shorter, and then you just kind of -- you're guessing on what the bounce is going to be.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, obviously in good position.  But I think what would be the biggest positive, just your mentality?  
AUSTIN ERNST: I think we're just kind of hanging in there.  I was 3-over through four, shot 3-over.  That was with a few putts that could have been made kind of coming in.  Kept myself in the tournament.  Didn't let it get away from me.  One back going into the weekend.   
So starting the week, that would have been -- I would have taken that probably.  So I'm right there, right there with 36 holes left.
