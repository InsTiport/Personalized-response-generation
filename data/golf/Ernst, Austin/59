 Q.  So, Juli Inkster mentioned you in her press conference as one of the Americans she was really happy to see was playing well.  What does that mean to you?  AUSTIN ERNST: Oh, it's nice to be on that list.  Obviously, if I keep playing well, then all that stuff will kind of take care of itself.  So I'm just trying to play well each week and get in contention.   Q.  What did the confidence from winning in Portland do for you?  AUSTIN ERNST: Anytime you can win, especially on this level, that always gives you more confidence just knowing you can compete, knowing you can win.  I won that week and felt like I didn't make every putt or I didn't have to play perfect golf, so that is basically what it taught me.   Q.  Pretty pleased with 2-under today?  AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, had a few bogeys out there, but it's solid out here.  The rough's up this year.  It's kind of windy early.  It's kind of died down a little bit now.   Q.  How much did you think about the Ryder Cup or Solheim Cup?  AUSTIN ERNST: Not a lot.  There is nothing I can do other than just try to keep playing well.  So, obviously, if I can keep playing well and hopefully get a few wins between now and then, that will do it.   Q.  Do you ever look at the standings?  AUSTIN ERNST: I look at them, yeah (laughing).   Q.  How often?  AUSTIN ERNST: Just once every month probably.   Q.  What do you think Juli will be like as a captain?  AUSTIN ERNST: I think she'll be really laid back.  She'll -- I know everybody loves Juli, so everybody's going to want to play hard for Juli and bring the cup back.   Q.  Juli has talked about how she doesn't really want to have to make the decision.  She wants it to be the 12, so she might not even make captain's picks, per se.  Does that add more pressure or less pressure to you?  AUSTIN ERNST: No, I'm trying to play my way on to that team.  I don't want to have to be a captain's pick, so that will all shake out.   Q.  What would that mean to you to be on that team though?  AUSTIN ERNST: It would be a huge honor.  Anytime you get to represent your country, you're one of the best players for your country, that is a huge honor to be able to go over there, especially, and play.   Q.  Match Play, do you like that better?  Do you like that worse?  AUSTIN ERNST: I have no preference.  I basically prepare for it the same way.   Q.  How close are you with the other girls on the team?  AUSTIN ERNST: I'm pretty close with everybody.  Obviously this being my third year I know everybody that's played, everybody that's kind of in the hunt for it.   Q.  Do you talk at all about your two in a row, first time they've ever defended on their own soil?  AUSTIN ERNST: No, we don't.  We're the underdogs this year.   Q.  That's what Juli said yesterday.  AUSTIN ERNST: Yeah, they've won two of them in a row, so we've got to go win it back.
