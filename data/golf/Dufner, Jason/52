 Q.   You played well in the middle of the round there, but a solid finish on the back nine, heading into the weekend at 5‑under par.   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I made a couple birdies there at 15 and 16 to kind of get a decent number, but I struggled to get the ball in the fairway, which is key out here.   It's really hard to control your ball out of the rough and give yourself birdie looks.   Next two days I've got to find some fairways.  
   
 Q.   What's going to be the key to finding fairways do you think?  
JASON DUFNER:   Hitting it straight.   No, you know, I've struggled a little bit, been sick a little bit, on an antibiotic, don't feel as good as I did last week, so maybe I'll get through that and get the feeling, but I don't have a great feel for my swing right now.   It's tough out here, you've got a lot of crosswinds and doglegs and you've got to shape shots.   I'll just keep working with it.  
   
 Q.   36 holes left, an opportunity to have a good tournament?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I'm in a good spot.   If you get it going you can shoot 5‑ or 6‑under out here and move up that leaderboard, so hopefully that'll be key this weekend.
