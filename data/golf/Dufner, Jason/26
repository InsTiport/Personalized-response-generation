Q. Jason, great round today.  Great start.  Your iron play really stood out for me today.  Did it stand out for you?
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I've been hitting it pretty good.  Last week I hit it pretty good.  I think I was first in greens in regulation last week, and I'm up there again.  Just trying to stay patient with the putter.  Hopefully some of those eight- to 15-footers will start going in and it will be a low round.
Q. One round to go, you spoke about the putting.  Is that all you need to focus on or anything else need to change to find the winner's circle tomorrow?
JASON DUFNER: Shooting a lower score.  There's five or six guys that are double digits under par, so they're probably going to be ahead of me, so there will be a lot of guys with a chance.  This course is pretty receptive I think for good scoring.  You're seeing that today.  Guys are shooting 2-, 3-, 4-under pretty easily, so I'm going to need something low because one of those guys that's ahead of me is probably going to have a low score.
