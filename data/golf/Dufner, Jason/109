Q.   Off to a good start, 2-under today.   Obviously nothing much you can do about the weather but the four, five holes you got through.?
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah.   It was a good start, good to get some holes in today.   Obviously the weather didn't cooperate.   So, kind of come back tomorrow and give it a chance to play in these conditions in this weather and have a good go at it tomorrow.

Q.   Certainly not the first time you've been affected by weather.   You kind of hang tonight, hang low?
JASON DUFNER:   Got to find a hotel to stay in since we checked out.   Other than that, just the same routine, and come back tomorrow and kind of lucky with not having to play next week.   Don't have to worry about getting to The Barclays and getting ready for that event. 
Little bit different from some other guys that got to kind of rush over there and change their schedule for next week.   Just find a hotel to stay in and come back tomorrow and try to finish it off.
