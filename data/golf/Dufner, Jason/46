 Q.   This is high level stuff, obviously.   You got beat by the No.1 player.   What's the feeling after playing this great player?  
JASON DUFNER:   He's a great player, obviously No.1 in the world.   It's tough to beat him.   He's a great player.   It's tough to concentrate, he's so good looking, too.  
He made the birdies.   I thought maybe I could sneak one in there on 17, but he topped me.   I'm happy to be playing a little bit better.   Happy with my confidence since Augusta.   Maybe that will kick start my year.  
   
 Q.   Overall you talked about your confidence being higher, but for you playing so well in the place where Hogan, a guy you admire, made it famous.   How can you evolve and advance to get a second Major Championship during the season?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, a little disappointing.   I want to win here.   Been close two times, been on the other side of it.   Keep coming back.   At least for the next four years I think I'll be here.   Keep coming back, trying to win.   
As far as the Majors go, we've got three of them left.   I think that's where everybody tries to peak.   I thought I was in a good spot going into Augusta and failed miserably.   So we'll see how the next three go, and hopefully I'll have some better luck.   
   
 Q.   Pretty exciting in that playoff.   Talk us through 18.   
JASON DUFNER:   Had a great look.   Probably the same one I had in regulation.   In my first playoff hole, and I hit it through the break.   And I made a great putt on 17.   And then obviously a fantastic shot there.   So in between clubs on the last.   
A good week, I felt like I played pretty good.   Hung in there.   So hopefully a good start to the year.
