 Q.   Jason, I was talking to the assistant captain Scott Verplank.   He said you were playing beautifully.   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I really like this format, this environment.   For me I feel like there's a little bit less pressure.   I'm not trying to post a score, I'm just trying to play golf and enjoy the day and be with a teammate and try to get a point for the team.   You know, I'm just caught up in each hole being a point and win points for the team, so that takes a lot of stress out for me.
