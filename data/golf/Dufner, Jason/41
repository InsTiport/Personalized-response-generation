  JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, a little up and down.   Course is pretty scorable today.   They have it set up pretty easy.   
Probably see some low scores.   
Yeah, so too many bogeys.  
   
 Q.   How tough is that 16, 17, 18 finish?  
JASON DUFNER:   Not too bad.   It's a toughest stretch of the course obviously.   Birdied 16, and thought I was going to have a nice finish.   Bogeyed last two with some pretty poor play.  
   
 Q.   How has the neck been?  
JASON DUFNER:   Pretty good.   Thursday I was a little sore, but felt good yesterday and today.  
   
 Q.   Confident you can hold up tomorrow?  
JASON DUFNER:   Hope so.   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   How refreshing is it for you be able to play a couple good rounds?   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, nice to get.   Many been away from the game for a while.   Couple months.   Good to be out here competing.   You know, I was playing pretty good.   I just got to clean up some of the mistakes.  
A lot the bogeys this week.   Nice to play four rounds, and keep going next week hopefully.   
   
 Q.   Heading into tomorrow, do you have hopes of producing an awesome round?  
JASON DUFNER:   I'm not too concerned about it.   Just trying to go out there and play some golf.  
Feel like I'm playing pretty good that I can shoot 5‑ or 6‑under if everything goes right.   You never know.   Get really hot with the putter and put some pressure on the guys with a low round early.   Could happen.   
My expectations for this four week stretch were pretty low.   Just want to get out here and play again.
