 Q.  Jason, it looks like you got it back going in a positive direction toward the back nine, is there something positive you can take out of it?  
JASON DUFNER: I'm still in this tournament, a couple of shots back on Sunday.  So today was pretty pathetic on all accounts.  So have to play better tomorrow.   
 Q.  After you're sitting there at 11, how do you get yourself to rally a little bit, because things --  
JASON DUFNER: Because there's still 27 holes left.  The tournament is not over.  It will be over tomorrow.   
 Q.  Is that something you have to tell yourself, let's just get through this?  
JASON DUFNER: 72 hole golf tournament.   
 Q.  You still have a mindset for winning?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I'm in good position.  Not as good as I'd like to be, but still have a chance to win the tournament.   
 Q.  Is that little putt, though, the one that hurt you the most?  
JASON DUFNER: No, pretty much the whole day.   
 Q.  Did you have that feeling coming in?  
JASON DUFNER: No, just got off to a bad start.  Bad bogey on 3, bad bogey on 4.  Hit pretty good shots on 6, made bogey.  Couldn't get anything going early.  And then you're kind of fighting it.  And just not a real good day.   
 Q.  Your partner seemed --  
JASON DUFNER: He played well.
