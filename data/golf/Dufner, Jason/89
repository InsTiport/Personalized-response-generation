  JASON DUFNER:   Not too bad of a week.   I thought I hit it well and played pretty well the whole week.   Just didn't quite score as good as I would like.   The putter didn't quite cooperate for the week, and a couple of putts each day added up to a pretty big number.  
   
 Q.   How were your thoughts after five birdies in eight holes today?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I got off to a good start which is something I wanted to do.   Just couldn't convert a par putt on 9 and from there, I just couldn't get anything going really.   
So it's funny how those bogeys kind of set you back for the rest of the day, and make it a little bit more difficult.   I was trying to get a push there, and just wasn't able to do it.   
   
 Q.   And yet, when you see the scoreboard at the end, the leaderboard; is this the kind of foundation for a season that's vaguely satisfying at least?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it was a good week.   Came off to a decent week in Hawai'i.   I feel like my game is right there.   
Never feel like I'm too far off from playing really well and competing for tournaments, just a couple shots each day, got to clean those up if I want to compete out here or in the U.S.  
   
 Q.   I appreciate you have not had a chance to see an awful lot but you're onto Qatar in the same kind of part of the world; have you enjoyed the experience of being here?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it's been good.   Came over to play these two events, got some great fields, great golf courses, and looking forward to going over next week and playing some more golf here in the Middle East.
