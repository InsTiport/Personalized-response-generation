 Q.   64, might not be quite enough but imagine you're pretty pleased with that?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it was a nice day.   The course has been pretty scorable.   Haven't had a really low round since I've been on this trip, so it was nice to finish this trip with a good round.  
Today.   Probably going to be a couple shots short, but you know, still pretty proud of the way I played today.  
   
 Q.   Interesting back nine, birdies, bogeys, just a couple of pars?   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, birdies, I was in the position that I felt like I had to kind of step on it if I wanted to have a chance.   The 12th hole got me all week.   I think I played it 4â€‘over the whole week.   That could be the deciding factor.   Some birdies there.   
Had a good look on 18 to get to 20 and maybe put a little heat on the leader, but I think it's going to be a couple short.  
   
 Q.   All in all, a good week?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, definitely.   I played well.   Been tough for me, each week I've had different types of greens to get used to.   The first week I was out we had bent, last week was bermuda and this week was paspalum.   I started getting more comfortable on the greens today and made some nice putts on the back.   
   
 Q.   Different grass and different caddies.   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, different caddie every week, too.   It worked out pretty good.   I wish my guy was over here with me, but didn't work out that way and was able to pick up some guys and they were able to help me out each week.
