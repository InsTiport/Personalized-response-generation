 Q.  Jason, you got yourself in a good position there with 65 today, correct?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, today was a pretty good day.  Moved up the leaderboard a little bit and I don't know, depending on what the guys do behind me, should have a decent chance to try and get another win.   
 Q.  How was the eagle on 16?  
JASON DUFNER: Good.  I had a good number.  I know that kind of funnels in there if you can get it right in the right spot.  Kind of hit it close to where I wanted to.  Got a good kick and got other people on the same line.  Makes it pretty easy, too.   
 Q.  Jason, you started pretty well back from the leaders today (inaudible).  
JASON DUFNER: I don't really play like that.  I kind of play the golf course as it is.  Wind changed today so it made it a little more difficult on the front-9.  The back-9, you have some chances to score.  So I just played and I had a good score and the leaders drop back a little bit, we'll have another day tomorrow.   
 Q.  Obviously got very good vibes around this place.  Kind of sad to see it be last year?  
JASON DUFNER: Little bit.  We'll have to go and see what Trinity Forest is like.  I don't have much control over the venues on the Tour.   
I've had a lot of good history here.  I've had some Top-10s.  I had a win.  In good position going into tomorrow.  Maybe we can send it out with a win tomorrow and check out the new location next year.   
 Q.  With the wind change make, 11 a little less risky than usual?  
JASON DUFNER: I don't play 11 with a driver so it's the same to me.  Lot of guys play driver there.  For me it's not a big advantage.  I can't really get it on the surface so I play it as a layup and a wedge.
