Q.   This Ryder Cup, you're a rookie, you don't show much emotion out on the golf course normally.   What was going through your mind?
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it's hard not to get up in front of these fans with so much at take in the singles match.   You know, I made a couple nice putts there that kind of got me fired up a little bit.   So this is a really fun environment to play in.   Excited to get that point today for the team, and going to go back and cheer the guys on, and hopefully can get another point and a half and get this thing done with.
