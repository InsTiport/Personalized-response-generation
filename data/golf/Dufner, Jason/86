Q.   Are you feeling any better?
JASON DUFNER:   A little bit. 

Q.   Just some thoughts on being out there, and Phil had it really going, and you and Rickie played pretty good, too. 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, everybody in the group played really well.   Obviously Phil stands out today, had a chance to shoot 59, which doesn't happen very often in our sport, and he drove it pretty well and hit some great iron shots and holed some putts.   That's what it takes to get it done.   Obviously this is one of the courses where low scores are prevalent, and he made a run at that elusive number I guess you could say. 

Q.   When did you become aware, or when were you thinking he might shoot‑‑
JASON DUFNER:   He started off real hot and then kind of made the move there on our first nine and the start of our back nine really hot, and started adding it up, and you're like, man, he's got a chance to do this.   Those last couple holes on the back nine are some of the tougher on this golf course, but he gave it a pretty good run.

Q.   What did you think about the putt on 9?
JASON DUFNER:   Unlucky.   He was walking it in.   I was looking at it, it looked good from my end, and then all of a sudden it didn't go in.   It would have been pretty exciting for the fans and for Phil and for everybody there to be part of that.

Q.   Talk a little bit about your play. 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I played okay today.   Obviously it doesn't look that good compared to my playing partner, but fairly pleased with the way.   Been a little bit under the weather, been traveling a lot, so it was important to come out this morning and get a good round, and get some rest when I go back.
