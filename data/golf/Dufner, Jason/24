Q. Must be nice to be back in Maui?
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, it's a great place to start.  You know, I had some time off from the end of last year for me.  So to come out bogey-free, had some good weather today, not to windy, no rain.  So it was nice to be here.
Q. The time off, anything special you worked on on the game?
JASON DUFNER: Not really.  A little bit of just maintenance stuff.  I worked a little bit on my fitness to be honest with you, trying to get a little bit stronger, a little bit more flexible.
And to be honest, getting away from the game is big for me.  Taking the time off and decompressing, getting into kind of a normal life, as opposed to being out here every week.
It was a nice break.  It makes me a little bit hungrier when I come back.
Q. Now, you're perennially known as a fantastic ball-striker, but over 140 foot's worth of putts today.  What's the key on the greens?
JASON DUFNER: I'll take it.  A little bit of luck with those.  I made a couple long ones.  I missed a couple short ones, so kind of off-set.  But any day you're making over 75 feet of putts, you'll be pretty happy.
