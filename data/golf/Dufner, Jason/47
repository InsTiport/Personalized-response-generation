Q.   General quotes on your round? 
JASON DUFNER:   Pretty up‑and‑down today.   Did some good things.   Seemed like every time I did something good, I'd make a bogey or struggled to make a par,   so no consistency to the round.

Q.   Seems like you and Jordan were doing the same thing. 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, didn't drive it very well in the beginning and out of position.   So the scores are out there today, saw some low scores.   I think the locations were pretty easy if you get the right clubs in your hands.

Q.   You're still not that far off the lead. 
JASON DUFNER:   No, a couple back.   So we'll see how it goes tomorrow.
