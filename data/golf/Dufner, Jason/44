 Q.   Real quick, your thoughts about the Web.com Tour event being played from where you're from?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it's neat.   We had a couple of years where I played some events back home.   But I'm familiar with the country club, so it should be a good event and excited.   
Hopefully they can find a title sponsor sometime and make it a longâ€‘term deal.  
   
 Q.   Overall your thoughts about that golf course that they're going to play?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it's a good golf course.   I don't remember a lot of it, but I remember when I was a junior playing a little bit and remembering it was a good setup.   
I think guys will find it pretty challenging.   This is a good time of year for golf courses up here, so I think it will be in good shape and a good test.  
   
 Q.   Any memory that sticks out from your brief time out there?  
JASON DUFNER:   On that course?   
   
 Q.   The Web.com Tour.   
JASON DUFNER:   It's a great place to get ready and to prepare.   And you can make some good money playing out there now.   
So I always enjoyed what that Tour offered, even though I was trying to get out here and be out here full time.   
So I think guys got great opportunity, especially with how the Q School thing is structured now for them to really get out, play a lot of golf around the country, around the world right now, where that Tour's going, and gives them a good chance to be out here.
