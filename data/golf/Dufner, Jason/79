Q.   Jason, just wrap up what the week has been like for you.   I know you maybe didn't play quite as well as you wanted but your week defending your championship from last year. 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it was good, fun to have folks out supporting me. 
It's just not much fun playing golf right now the way I'm playing. 

Q.   What do you think the main issues were for you this week? 
JASON DUFNER:   Pretty much everything.   Can't score, so that's the name of the game out here.   You got to make birdies and save pars when you can, and I can't do it, so very frustrating time for me right now golfwise. 

Q.   And to comment on today's round, 2â€‘over, but the conditions, it's getting tough out there? 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it's tough out there.   Guys are going to be struggling with their ball striking, so it's going to be imperative to convert the birdie opportunities you get and try and save some par opportunities.
