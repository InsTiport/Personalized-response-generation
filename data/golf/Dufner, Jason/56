Q.   What a nice way to start the new calendar year, put a new driver in the bag, you hit every fairway. 
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I played pretty solid today.   Ball‑striking was really good.   Put being wasn't quite as good on the back nine but nice, solid way to start the year, no bogeys.   Looking forward to continuing some good play this week. 

Q.   Bogey‑free, no one makes everything.   You didn't have a 3‑putt, which was something that was a concern for you last year?
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, last year, I had a lot of 3‑putts out here.   We did some work on Monday and Wednesday.   My caddie and I were working on the speed.   Speed was pretty good and just had some of those cross‑brainer, cross‑breaks out here that you get and you've just got to be really confident with your line.

Q.   Since you've played here before, the wind, the unusual wind this week, did it help that you have experience on this golf course?
JASON DUFNER:   A little bit.   I haven't played this course in this wind.   So the two practice rounds, three practice rounds, were completely different.   Today was something I've never seen.   Personally I would like to see the course firm up a little bit and that wind coming out of the correct position make this golf course play like we're used to.
