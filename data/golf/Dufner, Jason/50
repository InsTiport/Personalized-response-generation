 Q.   I guess when you can chip in on 17 to close things out, how good to you feel moving forward?  
JASON DUFNER:   I've been lucky to survive both days.   I haven't played very well either day.   So that's just the kind of format we're in.   You can get through by not playing very well.   But I don't think I can do that all week.   Hopefully my couple of bad rounds are done with and I can start playing some good golf going on forward.  
   
 Q.   How many confidence does it give you winning but not playing with your best stuff?   Hopefully things click, maybe it gets easier.   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, you know, one of the things playing this those team events, Presidents Cup, Ryder Cup, I learned to be patient in match play.   I've been patient, which is good, and just kind of hope to get back in the match with a birdie or maybe somebody making a mistake and I've kind of lived by that the first two days.
