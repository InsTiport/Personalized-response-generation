Q. On the back, perfect day for scoring.  You found some out there.
JASON DUFNER: It wasn't too bad early in the day.  It was a little bit tough, kind of cool, pretty damp out there from the rains we got.  We were picking up some mud on the golf balls, which is challenging, but seemed to dry out on the back-9 and played pretty good.
Q. Everybody was saying this golf course earlier in the week was firm and fast.  After not being able the see after the deluge yesterday, how did it change?
JASON DUFNER: A lot.  The ball was running out 20 yards.  The greens weren't receptive to shots on the fairways.  Tuesday when I played it was the opposite, ball kind of sticking in the mud in the fairways and staying really close to the pins if you got the right number.  It played a little bit easier, but with the weather and it being cool and then you get these mud balls, it makes a different type of challenge.
Q. With that change, what is the key to scoring around this place now?
JASON DUFNER: Little bit of luck, to be honest with you.  You can catch a mud ball the wrong way and some water hazards that get in the way.  I think if you can manage to play the tougher holes around par, you got a lot of chances with wedges out here on this golf course.  Not too many guys are reaching the par-5s in 2.  Lot of wedges on those.  Couple of other par-4s with wedges, so take advantage of those.
Q. Good start, keep it up.
JASON DUFNER: Thank you.
