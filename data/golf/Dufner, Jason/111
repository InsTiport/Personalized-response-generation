 Q.   What's your take on this course?   Is it a fair setup for a PGA Championship?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, not too bad.   The conditions were pretty good for three days.   Obviously Friday was a little more difficult, made it tougher for us, but all in all, not too bad for conditions and playability of the golf course.  
   
 Q.   If everything works out down the road and this becomes part of a circuit on the PGA Championship, would you guys be good with coming back here?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, if the weather is halfway decent.   You don't want to play every day like it was on Friday, really high scores and a lot of frustration out there.   But I think if you can get conditions like this, guys can put a good number up.   
   
 Q.   I think you're locked in for the Ryder Cup or at least right there, assuming everything holds.   Talk about making that team.   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, it would be nice.   Hopefully it'll work out that way and I don't have to worry about Davis picking me, and looking forward to the experience.   Looking forward to getting after it out there toward the end of the summer.  
   
 Q.   Do you know that course very well, Medinah?  
JASON DUFNER:   Never played it.  
   
 Q.   Do you like that type of setup?  
JASON DUFNER:   I guess.   I've never seen it.
