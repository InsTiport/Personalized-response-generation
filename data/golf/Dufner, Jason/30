 Q.  Jason, let's talk about birdie, birdie finish, 68 with the wind conditions, you have to be really pleased?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, this is a really tough golf course.  Got a little bit of the northwest wind today which we don't play very much on this course, so guys got to make adjustments.  We didn't get it in the practice rounds.  It's a tough golf course as it is with no wind and then you throw that wind; so I'm happy with two under.  Anything around par today or under par is going to be a great score.   
 Q.  You hit 13 of 18 greens, and the other guys, like nine or ten, so ball-striking wise in these conditions, you have to be pleased with that, too.  
JASON DUFNER: It's a good fit for me.  Generally speaking I play pretty good here.  I think the ball-striker have a little bit of an advantage being able to control your ball in that wind, work it against it or work it with it and keep it out of that wind.  I grew up down here so I'm pleased to playing in this type of weather.   
 Q.  Having grown up in Miami, the greens, the wind, you like this, don't you?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, it's a good fit for me.  Sometimes a little bit disadvantage for me out here and I don't quite get the height.  I'm used to playing the ball low living down here, but it's nice to play down here where it's to my advantage.   
 Q.  You're playing so well right now, how good is the game, because every week now, you're just consistently good.  
JASON DUFNER: I started out really good.  Had a little bit of a stretch there on the West Coast, I don't generally play those events well, but I thought it was important to get out there and play and compete.  Looking forward to this Florida Swing because I usually play pretty good.  I'm happy to be off the West Coast and back in Florida playing golf again.
