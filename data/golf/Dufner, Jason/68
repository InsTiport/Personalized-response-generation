 Q.   Nice 5-under par round to start your tournament.  
JASON DUFFNER:   Yeah, I didn't hit it very well, probably one of the worst ball‑striking days I've had this year, but putted really good so that was the difference, holing putts, saving pars.   And when I actually hit some good shots I converted them.   I'm happy to get through the day with a nice number.  
   
 Q.   You certainly did putt well, you only had 23 today.   Very nice job putting.   
JASON DUFFNER:   Yeah, it's nice for me.   23 putts.   Pretty good.   So that's why the score was what it was today.   
I've got to clean up the ball‑striking to be competitive this week.   But to shoot 5‑under was good.
