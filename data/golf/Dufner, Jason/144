 Q. When you started you were 16-under, two back of Mark Wilson. Was there a number you had in mind when you woke up this morning? 
 JASON DUFNER: Probably 2-under I thought maybe would have a chance. If I could be at 19-under, you've got four pretty easy holes; two reachable par-5s; 17, a drivable par-4. So 2-under is pretty acceptable. I wish I had one more, though.

 Q. Are you a watch-and-wait guy or are you a range guy?
 JASON DUFNER: I'm going to go to the range. Those first four holes I just played probably weren't the best for ball-striking. I kind of have trouble with restarts as it is, so go over there and try to calm down a little bit and maybe sort something out for a possible playoff.
