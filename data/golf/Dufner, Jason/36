 Q.  Nine birdies today, Jason.  You made quite a few out there.  Talk about your day a little bit.  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I've been playing pretty good the last couple days.  Today I got off to a slow start, but I wasn't too worried about it because I knew I was playing good, and made eight birdies in my last 13 holes, so pretty good.   
 Q.  Do you have a number in mind to go out and shoot tomorrow, or are you just going to make as many as you can?  
JASON DUFNER: No, as many as you can.  Guys are going to be going low.  Just not really focused on results right now, just more into the process, and whatever the results add up to is what they add up to.
