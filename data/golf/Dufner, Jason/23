Q. Even with a bogey on the last hole there, 5-under par, good day, how would you assess your round?
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I played pretty good.  Had some shots going left throughout the round.  Can't really do that on the 18th hole.  But I'm happy with how I played.  I played pretty good.  So hopefully the weather will kind of stay like this.  It makes it a little easy for us, and looking forward to the weekend.
Q. You talked about getting away from the game for awhile, and you've kind of come back with that hunger a little bit.  What part of your game are you surprised that's played so well after two rounds this week after being away?
JASON DUFNER: Just playing the game good.  I'm not quite on the form that I would like to be with usually how I hit it, but just kind of getting out of my own way and not worrying too much about that and actually trying to play the game a little bit more.
We've got a lot of room to play out here.  It's not extremely penal out there, so I've gotten away with a lot of my poor shots.  Just staying patient and trying to play the game of golf.
