Q. 5-under today, what did you like about your play today?
JASON DUFNER: I kind of finished good, which is nice.  I finished with a couple birdies there on 16 and 18.  Had a good day going, played really well.  But those birdies at the end always kind of make the day a little bit better.  So it was a nice way to finish.  Hopefully, we'll get out there tomorrow and continue some good play.
Q. There's been a few rain delays this season, but how difficult is it to mentally and physically reset yourself to get back out there?
JASON DUFNER: It's not too bad.  I think most of the guys get into a type of routine that they're comfortable with when that happens.  Been pretty lucky, a lot of the tournaments we have had rain delays, I haven't been playing.  So a couple weeks ago we had one.  This week we had one.  So you just get in your routine and you kind of do what you normally do when you get back and get time off and just try to get back out there when you get out there and play well.
