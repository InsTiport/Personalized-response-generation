 Q.  Well, first of all, right now there's 34 guys within six shots of the lead, and can you kind of talk about that scenario with that much of a logjam?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I mean, that will be some exciting golf on the weekend for fans and the players.  Seems like anybody that's under par or even is probably going to have a chance.  The course is starting to firm up a little bit, get a little bit tougher.  Definitely don't anticipate anybody holding a 7-under.  Who knows what it will be.  But I think it will be lower than that.   
So if you go out and shoot a couple under each day, you're going to be right in the thick of it for a championship.   
 Q.  And probably obviously a bit like you got a birdie on 8, coming down the stretch.  Could you tell me what happened on that?  
JASON DUFNER: I just had a really good number, a good position in the fairway, I had a good number for the iron and hit it in there really close.  So that's like stealing a little bit.  By they kind of come and go.  I had a couple opportunities before that on 7, 5, 6 (indiscernible) slip away, so it was good to get back under in the red for the week.   
 Q.  With such a logjam, I mean, how critical does that make every single opportunity you get like that?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I mean, try to tighten it up a little bit on the weekend.  Not much I can do what happened Thursday and Friday.  I feel like I'm playing some really good golf.  I've been close to shooting 2- to 4-under every day (indiscernible).   
I love the golf course.  I think it's going to be get firmer and faster, which I think will help me.  And just got to tighten it up a little bit, limit those mistakes and throw in some birdies.  It's pretty gettable there on the first seven holes.  So got to get off to a good start.
