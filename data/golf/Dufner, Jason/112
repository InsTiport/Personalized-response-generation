Q.   Talk about conditions yesterday versus today, still windy?
JASON DUFNER:   Not near as much wind today as yesterday.   It was pretty rough, which makes this golf course play tough.   I had a pretty good day today.   A couple of mistakes which I wish I had back but much better today than yesterday.

Q.   You had six birdies out there, so you had the putter going?
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, I putted well, which is nice.   That's kind of what you have to do on this golf course because you're not going to hit a ton of shots close to the pin and you're going to miss a lot of greens no matter what you do. 

Q.   Does this round give you a little bit of confidence going into tomorrow? 
JASON DUFNER:   I think so.   I've been feeling pretty good with my game.   Yesterday wasn't too bad with the conditions.   Just the first day wasn't very good, and today was nice to kind of bounce back and get going in the right direction.
