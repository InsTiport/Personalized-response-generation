  Q. You went off early. Did you sense a big change in the course conditions?   
 JASON DUFNER: A little bit. Not so much the conditions, but the wind did pick up a little bit. It was pretty calm this morning for my first 12 or 13 holes, and then you got increments of maybe 3- to 5-miles-per-hour wind. Towards then 17 and 18 was probably close to 10, somewhere between 10 and 15.  
  
  Q. Was it a club's worth?   
 JASON DUFNER: Yeah, probably one club's worth into or down.  
  
  Q. How much of an advantage is it to have played when the wind is doing this to get a good number in and you have a long time to go back out tomorrow?   
 JASON DUFNER: Yeah, huge advantage. Thursday morning is usually the easiest golf course to come play. So to have those calm conditions and get off to a good start, maybe get ahead of the field just a little bit with a good round.   
 You'd kick yourself if you were 3 or 4 over early today for sure.  
  
  Q. What do you do traditionally if you have an early Thursday tee time? How do you handle that?   
 JASON DUFNER: I kind of like it. It gives you a little time to assess and relax. This week's kind of tough. The heat's up, temperature's up. As far as endurance goes, it will be tough this week. It will give me a good bit of time to relax and rest and try to get focused and ready.
