 Q. So many players talked about it being tough to pick the right time to hit the shots. Do you agree with that today?  
JASON DUFNER: Yeah, I caught a gust on the fourth hole and I hit a 6‑iron that went about 120 yards. So I was off by 50 on that hole.   
Then the next hole I thought it was down wind and caught an into‑the‑wind gust and hit an 8‑iron that went about 110 yards.   
So it happens out here, you kind of just got to accept that it's the day and I did the best I could.   
Luckily, I was really good with my scrambling and my putting and put a decent score together for today.  
   
 Q. Is keeping a positive attitude a big part of playing in conditions like this?  
JASON DUFNER: I think it's different for everybody. Some guys have a negative attitude out here and they play pretty well and some guys can have a good attitude about it and play well. I.  
Think it's important to kind of be who you are. And today I just kind of accepted whatever the golf course gave us. Anything under 74 was going to be ‑‑ and maybe even 75 ‑‑ was going to be a pretty good round today. Just have to do it again tomorrow, probably, with these conditions and then hopefully we'll get some weather that we can score a little bit on the weekend.
