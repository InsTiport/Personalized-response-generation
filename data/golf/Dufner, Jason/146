 Q. Your thoughts sitting at 13-under and not really knowing where everybody else is right now?
 JASON DUFNER: Yeah, it's not too bad. I played pretty good the first 18 so I'd kind of like to get out and play some more, kind of keep the round going. 

 Q. A comment on your third round?
 JASON DUFNER: Yeah, played pretty solid, no bogeys, which is nice. Probably could have had a couple more birdies, maybe tighten up the putting a little bit and get after it this last round.
