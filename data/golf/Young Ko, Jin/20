 Q.  It's official. You wrapped up the Vare and the money title. How do you feel?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I am honored to win amazing awards. I try to do my best today, but putting was not good. Don't know. Just feel it's good, but my play was not good.   
So I will work harder and more, yeah.   
 Q.  With everything that was on the line, are you happier or do you just feel relief that it's over?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I feel just relax, and then but not the end, beginning. So I will more work harder, yeah.

 Q.  How is your ankle for that week?
