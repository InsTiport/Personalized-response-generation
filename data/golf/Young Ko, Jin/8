  Q. Jin Young, a 1-under par start talent Kia Classic.  How was the day out on the golf course?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I had great round today since missed cut two week ago.  And I had 18 greens -- I hit 18 greens and putt was little bit a lot, but I had still good position for next three days.
 Q. Seemed like there was kind of different wind variations today.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah.
 Q. Did the two nines play pretty different?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Different, yeah.  Back nine was more harder, and then it's going to be more windy afternoon.  So was tough too, but afternoon the other players will be more harder than us.
 So, well.
 Q. You got lucky with the draw.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah.  (Laughter.)
 Q. Last one for you.  We didn't play here last year obviously.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, yeah.
 Q. How nice is it to be able to come back to Aviara?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, always fun to play Aviara, and I played 2018 and '19 and this year, so I had a lot of fun last two years ago.  Looking for the good, fun things on next three days.
