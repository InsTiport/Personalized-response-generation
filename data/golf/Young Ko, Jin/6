  Q. Nice 2-under to end your time at the Kia Classic.  How do you feel about your performance this week leading into the ANA?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I had good warmup I think, so I'm looking for next week at the ANA.
 I had great round last four days.
 Q. What was it about this course that especially helped prepare you for next week?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   I think this course fairway was narrow so going to be hard to keep the fairway for next week course.
 And then this week was very windy, so I can't wait to play next week.
 Q. How much have you been practicing at Mission Hills?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, I had practices four or five days before this week.  I went to the -- I stayed a week at the Mission Hills and I, yeah, I saw that my name on the bridge and then I believe I was win this course.
 So I was happy.
 Q. So that gave you good vibes, I guess.  Was the course in good shape?  How did you find the golf course?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, last year rough wasn't longer, so I don't know.  I think they will a lot of water to rough so it's going to be long I think.
 Q. Right.  And just your thoughts on Inbee and how she's running away.  What do you admire the most about her game?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, she's legend I think, and she got a lot of wins in LPGA Tour.  I hope a little bit following to her.  (Laughter.)
 Q. Follow in her footsteps?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah.
