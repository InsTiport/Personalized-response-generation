Q. You birdied four of your final six holes today.  What got going down the stretch?
JIN YOUNG KO: I had great round today.  So I had even par front nine; I was a little bit mad of golf.  But I'm playing good on the back nine so I was happy.  Many Korean people came to cheer up me and Sei Young, so we played better or really good today.
So looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. What does it mean to have so many Korean fans follow you today?
JIN YOUNG KO: If I can't see to the pin on the green, like up to the green, if my fans go there, so like loud, One feet or two feet, and that feel make me happy.
And then always fans like say, Jin Young Ko, like that, so happy.
Q. What kind of emotion does it give you when you hear the fans chanting your name?
JIN YOUNG KO: Awesome.  It was awesome.  My parents stay in Korea so I need Korean word.  I can hear a lot today, so it will be really, really good.
Q. You finished in second place here last year.  You find yourself in the hunt to win again coming into Sunday.  What did you learn from last year?
JIN YOUNG KO: Don't know.  I don't know.  I played really good last year with Inbee, and then I was a little bit tired last year because I went back to Korea and then to here, so now it's feel better.
I will sleep well tonight and then food and then like fun or movie or game.
