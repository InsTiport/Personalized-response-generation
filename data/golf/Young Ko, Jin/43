Q. Jin Young Ko, 1-under round.  Yesterday you told me you were focusing on fairways and greens.  How much more difficult was that with the wind picking up in the afternoon?
JIN YOUNG KO: Today was really, really windy.  I played with Jessica and we talk about so much different course in the morning and afternoon.  We have to play two more holes, so I want to (indiscernible.)  Oh, my God, me too.  But, have to be played two more.
But I'm still great round today, and so don't know.  It's really hard today, yeah.
Q. It's really exhausting playing through all the wind.  When you're thinking to yourself I just want to be done, how did you refocus to finish the round?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I will rest tonight for morning.  Also, I'm looking forward on the weekend.  Leader is 8-under.  I'm still good position for weekend, so I'm looking forward.
I will focus on the course and then I will really enjoy.
Q. With another late tee time for you tomorrow, being so close to the leader, what did you learn from playing in such a heavy wind here today going into tomorrow?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I think so tomorrow will be same windy on the course.  My caddie knows this course so I don't worry about windy or whatever.  Just try enjoy, yeah.
