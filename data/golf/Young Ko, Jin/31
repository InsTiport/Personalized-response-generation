Q. Alongside the winner of the Evian Championship, second major of the season, Jin Young Ko.  Coming into Sunday, I saw you this morning in the hotel lobby watching videos as relaxed as could be.  What keeps you so steady on Sundays at majors?
JIN YOUNG KO: Actually I saw like Bible something on the church.  My friends send to me this morning.  In Korea it's Sunday too, so I saw, and then I little cried.  And then glory to God today.
Thanks for a lot of fans and then volunteers this week.  I had really great time.  Also I'm looking forward next year at Evian.
Q. On the 18th green you had a little bit of time to look around and see all the fans around you.  What were you thinking about when you were looking around?
JIN YOUNG KO: My caddie said, Enjoy your time on the bridge, so I will try look around of my fans.  I will miss about that moment, so I was really happy.
Q. You're returning to the world's No. 1 spot for the second time in your career.  What's the most important lesson you learned the first time you were No. 1?
