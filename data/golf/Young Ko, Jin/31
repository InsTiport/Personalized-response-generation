 Q.  Are practice rounds overrated?  
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I didn't practice round as well. I play just pro-am nine holes and then my caddie arrive too late Wednesday.   
So I'm still play good today. Was happy.   
 Q.  You say your number one goal is to be the happiest golfer the tour. That easy to do when you're the best golfer at tour. Do you have any other goals to achieve this year?  
JIN YOUNG KO: No. I have left just four or five tournament this year to LPGA Tour, so I will keep it up.
