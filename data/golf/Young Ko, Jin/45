Q. This morning?

And I couldn't practice this morning because little injury my hand, so I'm happy.  Still great round.

JIN YOUNG KO: Uh-huh.
Q. Talk to us about that eagle.
JIN YOUNG KO: 63 meters to the hole and then I thought I need great spinning from third shot, so I will try another different Ping ball.
