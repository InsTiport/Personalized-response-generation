THE MODERATOR:   What a great second round here.  You started off on 1 but then your first birdie was on hole 6.
Was that when the momentum started kicking in for you?
JIN YOUNG KO:   Yes.  It was par-5 and then I try to get birdie, but I -- because I couldn't get the birdie before the No. 6, so it was great birdie.
Q. And we got a little bit of Houston and Dallas weather this morning.  Did that throw your game off at all, or are you a pro at the cold weather now?
JIN YOUNG KO:   Before when I play in KLPGA it was really cold, so I hate cold weather to play golf, but right now I love it.
Q. Because you play really well.  Was there a memorable birdie today for you?  You had it on 6, 10, 14, 15, and 17.
JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, 17 was great birdie.  16 was -- 16?
Q. 15.
JIN YOUNG KO:   15 was great birdie, too.  Yeah.
Q. You and Sei Young are one and two in the world.  Is there extra motivation playing alongside her?
JIN YOUNG KO:   Not really.  Just, yeah, I mean, world ranking is -- my thinking, my opinion, is it's just little things to play golf.
So if play good I can do world ranking No. 1 still; but if not, yeah, and then she plays good, she can do.  Yeah, doesn't matter really.
Q. My last question for you is:  What are you going to focus on for the next two days?  What is your strategy?
JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, I want to bogey-free round next two days, so I'm looking forward the weekend.
