Q. 6-under round.
JIN YOUNG KO: Uh-huh.
Q. What went well?
JIN YOUNG KO: My feeling was like really long time no play in LPGA Tour, because I play two weeks ago in Jeju Korean tournament, and then a week I rest. So feel really fresh.
And then I didn't play back nine, just nine holes yesterday. I don't know. I didn't know about course.
And then my caddie arrive yesterday night, so he work this morning 18 holes.
Q. Okay.
JIN YOUNG KO: But we had trust, and that's why I play really good today. And I had really great fun with Lydia and Brittany. It was good. Yeah.
Q. How did you find the back nine? 3-under, I think.
JIN YOUNG KO: Back nine was my front nine, so really like my feeling was like amateur. How can I -- where is target, like this. But still fun.
Q. Have you done that this season, where you hadn't...
JIN YOUNG KO: First time. First time, yeah.
Q. Well, it went well. Maybe you'll do it again.
JIN YOUNG KO: That is better.
Q. What was the tournament you played in Korea and what did you do on your week off?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I played like Samdasoo tournament in Jeju Island, and then after that I rest a week with my family and my dog, and then I met my friend a little bit and then I practice and then I came here on Saturday.
I practiced at the range. My feeling was really amateur. Oh, my God. I needed to practice a lot. So on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I practiced hard.
Q. Are you a little tired now?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, a little bit.
Q. What's your plan for the rest of the tournament? You're in a great position.
JIN YOUNG KO: Don't know. Course is really great, but this morning and today was a little bit windy so it was little hard to me.
But like same, but that was same condition to every player.
Keep it up.
Q. Some of the media were wondering if you've seen the photos of Brooks Koepka.
JIN YOUNG KO: I saw. Someone tag me. (Laughter.) Who did tag me? I clicked, who is that? It was Brooks.
Q. Did you think it was funny?
JIN YOUNG KO: Shy.
