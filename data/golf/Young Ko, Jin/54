Q. Really good day for you out there today.  How was today's round?
JIN YOUNG KO: Today, I did bogey-free round on Sunday and I finished 8-under last Saturday and Sunday.  So I was really happy.
Q. You made a lot of par saves today.  Was that pretty important for you?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, because my goal was bogey-free round on Sunday.  Every putt was really pressure to me and then I had three or four really important par putts, and I made it, so I'm happy.
Q. How are you feeling heading into next week?
JIN YOUNG KO: I love links course, and then still keep going until next week.  I try Top-10 or something.
Q. So you never played that course?  Have you heard anything about it before?
JIN YOUNG KO: Just narrow fairway and lots of wind.
