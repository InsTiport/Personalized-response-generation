Q. You came into this week as defending champion, and you ended it by equalling the best score of the week with an 8-under round.  You have to be very happy with your title defense.
JIN YOUNG KO: I think the day went by quite fast.  Lately I've been struggling somewhat because I wasn't having as much fun on the course compared to off-course, and I wasn't as happy as I was off-course than I was on-course [sic].
So I think there was sort of a discrepancy between life on course and life off course, and I was kind of trying to reach a balance.  So today, I didn't really have any specific goal of coming in the Top-10 or whatnot.  I just really wanted to enjoy myself out there and I think in that sense, I'm satisfied.
Q. What was the reason for the struggle on the course?  Was it a technical thing?
JIN YOUNG KO: I think I just wanted a break because since the beginning of the season, I've been in events, one after the other, and then especially after joining the LPGA when I was playing in Korea, I would have my close girlfriends who I could meet on course and kind of kick back.  But in the US, my close friends aren't there, and it's just like the same pool of people and I think that was where that struggle might have came from.
Q. Sounds as though today, you had a very relaxed approach, four birdies on the front nine, four birdies on the back, nice birdie here to finish.  Were you just playing good golf all around, or what was the key to you making birdies today?
JIN YOUNG KO: So I think I started off really well.  I birdied the first hole and then I think I just got into the rhythm of things quite naturally today, and today my goal was even if I 3-putted a hole, I just wanted to be able to get enough distance on my putts because I've been thinking that the green is really slow.
So all my putts have sort of fallen short throughout the rounds, like the first, second, third round.  So today, I was thinking even if I 3-putt a hole, I just want my putts to go a little bit more, and thinking that, that was just the right distance, so I was able to grab more birdies.
Q. What was the longest putt you made today?
JIN YOUNG KO: Four meters on No. 12.
Q. You won this tournament last year and you won your second LPGA Tour victory in Australia at the start of this year.  Asian Fall Swing events still to come.  What are your goals before you end the season?
JIN YOUNG KO: So of course the ultimate goal would be to win the CME and take away that huge purse.  That's my ultimate dream.
More realistically, I think I just really want to be able to have fun and be happy with the remaining events, and especially through the remaining events, I hope to be able to really gain an understanding of what's not working for me now so that I can improve for next season.
