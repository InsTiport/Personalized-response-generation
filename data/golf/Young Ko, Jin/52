Q. Really good round.  How did it feel out there?
JIN YOUNG KO: Today was really a little bit windy on the course, and then the course was really difficult to me.  I'm really trying to focus on my game.
Then I have a cold little bit the round, conditions was a little bit bad but still a good round.
Q. You're battling a cold?  How long has that been?
JIN YOUNG KO: Last night.  Just last night.  We went to swimming pool and I think I drunk lots of water, swimming pool water.
Q. How do you feel now getting yourself back toward the top of the leaderboard?
JIN YOUNG KO: A few weeks ago, I'm really tired on the course and then I'm not happy with the course.  So this week, I try happiness on the course and then don't think about the future.  Just focus on my now, just now, time and now.  That's good for me.
Q. What makes you happy?
JIN YOUNG KO: Don't think about future.  Not think about score.  Just now, shot by shot.  If I hit the ball and then hit was great, but the ball goes bad somewhere, that's fine.  Then try just shot by shot.
Q. And news came this week that you had clinched Rookie of the Year.
JIN YOUNG: Thank you.
Q. How awesome was that to start your week?
JIN YOUNG KO: Really all other players are awesome.  Every player is awesome.  It's a little bit, God was helping me a little bit, so I got Rookie of the Year.  I'm happy now.
