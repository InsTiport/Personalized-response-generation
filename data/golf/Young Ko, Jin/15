Q. You just shot a 3-under 69 today, an eagle on 11. Tell us about what happened on that hole?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yesterday I had driver, tee shot, with you ball goes left. So I played in the bunker, but I made birdie. But today, no wind. Just straight at it, and then I hit straight and then pin was 192 meters, almost 200 -- 210 yards, but I had 5-wood. Hit really good and I made the putt, so eagle.
Q. A good round today, and yesterday, too, in the terrible conditions. How much nicer was it playing today than it was yesterday?
JIN YOUNG KO: I thought today would be cold again. So I was wearing lots of things. But after nine, front nine, I was hot, so I took off everything. So I wear just like this, just one thing. But it's good weather today. I like this.
Q. Good weather and good fans, it's been great to see the fans out supporting you, your fan club. What is it like to play back here at home in front of your hometown fans?
JIN YOUNG KO: Always happy to be playing in Korea. Also a lot of crowd out there, and then I have YouTube channel, and so they know about my channel name. So they say, "Go Jin Young, go." It was really fun out there. So still fun, and I'm looking forward on the weekend.
Q. You're just two strokes behind Danielle Kang right now. How do you prepare to go in and battle for the title this weekend?
JIN YOUNG KO: She is a great player, so I have to make birdies, but the course is not easy, so try to be straight tee shot and on the green and make putts. I still have chance for hole-in-one, so I want to try.
Q. We had one on 11, so you still have two more chances. Kristen Gillman got one..
JIN YOUNG KO: What car did she get?
Q. She still got a 7 Series. Hopefully you get that this weekend?
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.
