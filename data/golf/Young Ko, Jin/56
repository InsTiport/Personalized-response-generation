Q. Jin Young, you had an awesome week here.  Tell me about your week.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I had a really good week this week in L.A.  I had lots of Korean food this morning and last night, seven days, so I can play well.
And then course was tough course, but I really -- I'm really trying to focus on my game and on the course.
So, yeah.  I do best.
Q. Yeah.  You did your best.  You did awesome.  And it felt more comfortable because you were eating more Korean food and you were surrounded by a lot of Korean fans.  What's the biggest difference between playing on tour in Korea and also in America?
JIN YOUNG KO: First one is here every tournament is four days; KLPGA is three days, sometimes four days.
And then Korea feels like mountain course, but here is more flat.  So playing easy to LPGA, yeah.
And then lots of gallery here.  And then using the English.  (Laughter.)
Q. Has that been challenging?  Are you learning a lot?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.
Q. A lot?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
Q. What's the most challenging part of being a rookie on the LPGA Tour?
JIN YOUNG KO: English.  Yeah, golf is -- every player a good, so I think really important is English.  To me.
Other players British, Scotland, from other country using English, but I'm using Korean.  So I have to learn other language, so difficult.
Q. Yeah, because you're trying to balance golf and English.
JIN YOUNG KO: And rest.
Q. Yeah, since you are doing well out here.  You should be so proud of yourself.  What are you most proud of?

Q. So playing your best?

Q. So you're not motivated by money?
JIN YOUNG KO: No.
Q. Or ranking; just yourself.

JIN YOUNG KO: He's dead.
Q. He died?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.  He died 12 days ago.
Q. I'm so sorry.
JIN YOUNG KO: I'm already in Hawaii, Lotte Championship, so we want to go to on the course on Monday, but my father told me, Grandfather is dead, died, so we have to go Korea.  You want to stay here or you want to go back to Korea?
Q. Hard decision?
JIN YOUNG KO: I have to back to Korea.  I can't believe it.  But I went to (indiscernible); I saw his picture, and then...

Q. Good plan.  So yesterday you talked about playing with Inbee.  You learned a lot.  You played with her again today.  What was that like?  Was it any different?  Were you just too focused on your own game?
JIN YOUNG KO: She is great on the course.  Really looks like Buddha.  No face.
Q. No emotions?
