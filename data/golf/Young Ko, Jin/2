  Q. Jin Young, you managed to shoot 1-under par today.  You had a couple putts that were very close.  Take me through the day and how you got to 1-under par.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, I was thinking greens were fast today, but it wasn't, so I had couple missed putt, like inside five feet.
 It was closer, but I missed a lot of putt today, so I will practice for putting after this interview.  So I can't wait tomorrow.
 Q. I mean, for missing several putts you're still T7 and within three of second place.  So you're still in a good spot.  How exciting is it to be in that spot, to know that you had the opportunities and if you can capitalize on them tomorrow you can continue to climb the leaderboard?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   I will finish strong for tomorrow and I have still chance for tomorrow as well.
 So, well, I will focus on my game for tomorrow for sure and I will enjoy it.
 Q. How did the wind change things, especially it wasn't nearly as windy the first couple days?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, first couple days breeze wasn't small, but today was like -- it was tricky.  Like when I hitting the ball breeze goes like into the breeze and way down breeze, so I had confused for club choice.
 But I have good caddie, so I'm fine.
 Q. He took good care of you.  How important is holding on to the No. 1 spot in the world to you?  Is it an important part of your game each week to make sure that you stay at No. 1?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, that's great honor to world ranking No. 1 and I'm enjoying right now.  I can say that like -- no, I can say just like my caddie -- my caddie is different as the other caddies, so it is good motivation for me, so I will keep harder than yesterday, than yesterday.
