 Q.  Nice round today.  
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.   
 Q.  Bogey-free.  4-under.  
JIN YOUNG KO: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What was working out there for you today?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I had loose round today.  I don't know why, but I had couple great shot; also I had just one loose shot at the par-3 No. 3 from the tee shot.  I had little draw but hit the rock and came out and then stay just this much.   
 Q.  Like an inch?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I make the par.  Pray to God.  I had really great round today.   
 Q.  Good par save.  So you're coming off a win.  How does that help your confidence this week?  What's your confidence level like?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I don't know.  Just play now.  Also I don't want think about future, so last week.  Just think about now.   
Caddie helps to me about think about this shot, so it's good.   
 Q.  So he helps you think about the present and focus on each shot in the moment?  
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  You guys have worked together for a couple events now.  
JIN YOUNG KO: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  It's going pretty well?  
JIN YOUNG KO: Uh-huh.  Five tournament, yeah.   
 Q.  How does he help you?  
JIN YOUNG KO: He's funny and then sometimes serious on the course.  He really like really great read for break on the green.  Also breeze west, southwest, or southeast.  Really doing great.   
He has really a lot of experience on the course.  So it's help me, yeah.   
 Q.  Nice.  What are you going to do to celebrate a good round today?  
JIN YOUNG KO: Cheeseburger.  Caddie told me if you make last two at the birdie putt, I will buy two cheeseburgers to you.  So I make maybe 15 feet, so cheeseburger.  He have to buy to me.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  In-n-Out?  
JIN YOUNG KO: No, here.  Smells really good.
