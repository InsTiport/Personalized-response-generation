  Q. Jin Young, some different conditions right out of the gate in the morning I imagine with some wind.  How did you adjust to that and stay adjusted?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, this morning was a lot of wind and I saw that weather forecast was wind in the morning, but this morning was like maybe over ten mile I think.
 So, yeah, but I had great round still and I had a lot of good opportunity for birdie, so I was happy.
 Q. You birdied No. 17, 18, and 2.  Any of those a little more special than the other?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, No. 17 birdie was good because I had just one bogey before that when I got birdie, so it was special.  And I got No. 18 as well, so, yeah, pretty.
 Q. How did you play 18 today?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I laid up and I got wedges third shot and I got birdie.
 Q. Nice, nice.  Take us through being in contention heading into the weekend and what it means and how you will draw on past major experience this weekend?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I think greens are -- like it's going to be more firmer than last two days, so I will focus on my game on the course and I will just enjoy.
 Q. What is about this golf course that brings out the best in you?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, greens are best.  Greens are best and I love this green.  And, yeah, I want to say thank you to Zachary Sepanik and his staff.
