  Q. Obviously a little wetter conditions today.  Just how different was Cypress playing from the first time you played?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Jackrabbit was like more shorter than Cypress and greens are more smaller than Cypress, too.
 But Cypress was longer, and then this morning was a little bit breeze little much, and then we had to play with the mud on the ball.  So it was difficult.
 But I don't know, everyone is same condition, same mud balls, so I had to.
 Q. With the added distance just because the ball doesn't travel as far, did you have to change up your strategy at all playing today?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   No.  I just try to little lower ball from the teeing ground for my driver.  So it was pretty good, and then ball goes lower and then little more release on the fairway so I can play -- I was play easier.
 Q. Looking ahead to the final round tomorrow, 1-over par for the championship.  Still very much in contention for this.  What excited you about the final round and this U.S. Women's Open?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   If gallery is it on the course it's going to be more fun, but it wasn't, so I will just focus on my game and on the course and I will enjoy 75th U.S. Women's Open.
