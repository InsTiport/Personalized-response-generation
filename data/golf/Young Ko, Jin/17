Q. Congratulations on your victory last week. Now, you're back to LPGA. How do you feel about attend Buick LPGA Shanghai?
JIN YOUNG KO: During the last two weeks playing in Korea, I think I had big cheering by so many people and received good energy. I won't play KLPGA tournaments any more this year, but now I have LPGA tournaments for the rest of the year. I want to give more focus on the LPGA events. I'll try to my best and show good finishes to all the golf fans.
Q. Winning a tournament surely takes a lot of energ. Isn't it physically tiring?
JIN YOUNG KO: Actually, it's a little tired. But the difference in score seems to be how well you use your concentration on the course. It's not easy but I'll try to manage well both my physical and mental health before the tournament. So I can use my concentration effectively.
Q. How did you manage your stamina?
JIN YOUNG KO: As soon as I arrived in China from Korea yesterday, I went to the gym to exercise and relaxed. I had a good long sleep until morning and came out in the afternoon to have lunch. Now I'm going to check the course.
Q. What are your goals for this week?
JIN YOUNG KO: The Asian Swings are no-cut tournaments. So players can focus more because they don't have to worry about the cut. My goal too is to focus a lot and play for making many chances to win. For now, my goal is enjoying to play on the course and playing without regrets.
