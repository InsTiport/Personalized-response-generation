THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've got to stop meeting this young woman here in the media center. This is getting repetitive. I'm here with Jin Young Ko, who is a four-time winner on the LPGA Tour this season now with a win at the CP Women's Open.
Jin Young, congratulations. You played 72 holes bogey-free. Have you ever done that before in a tournament?
JIN YOUNG KO: That is first time to bogey-free round, especially 72 holes. Yeah, it's cool.
THE MODERATOR: That is pretty awesome.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
THE MODERATOR: Did you know when you were out on the golf course just how well you were playing? Were you aware of how well you were playing?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, I knew already, especially No. 17. I got birdie, and then that's the time for win I felt.
THE MODERATOR: So 17 you felt comfortable you had the win?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, right.
THE MODERATOR: What was the whole experience like out there playing today with Brooke and all the crowds and Nicole playing so well?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, it was incredible crowd out here, and then lots of fans here and Koreans, too.
So I had great time with Nicole and Brooke. Always happy to be play with Brooke, especially here in Canada; more than fun. Yeah.
THE MODERATOR: What were some the highlights of your round? You had so many birdies.
JIN YOUNG KO: I would say No. 9 I hit -- par-5 -- I hit the 3-wood second shot but ball goes to right. So was bad luck, like kick left to right, so goes to hazard something, so I did unplayable.
And then I hit the fourth shot 63 meters from the rough, but I got par. It was huge par I think.
THE MODERATOR: You'd think that would give you so muscle confidence knowing you could get out of trouble like that.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. What was it like walking up the 18th green with Brooke, your arm around her shoulder? What was that like and for you what did it mean to you to offer that to Brooke?
JIN YOUNG KO: I thought when I walked the 18th green then I thought that crowd was to Brooke, not me, so, yeah, here is in Canada and then she has a lot of fans.
So, yeah, Brooke, this crowd is for to you. She said, No, it's you. So we did like hand -- like that, yeah. So, yeah. I like Brooke. (Laughter.)
THE MODERATOR: We all like Brooke.
Q. Just talk about you have 106 consecutive holes without a bogey in addition to the 72 this week. Can you just comprehended how that's possible given how difficult the LPGA Tour is week to week?
THE MODERATOR: Your last bogey was on the 2nd hole of your third round at the British Open.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah. I heard that from my friend last night, so I was try, okay, bogey-free round for Sunday, but I made it. It was cool.
And then I had difficulty No 9, but I did make par.
THE MODERATOR: I think your play on 9 was amazing. Jin Young is our first 72-hole bogey-free winner since Inbee Park won the 2015 HSBC Women's World Championship, so that's some fabulous company for you to join.
Q. You have a Canadian connection since Gareth Raflewski is one of your coaches. What has Gareth helped you with and how important has he been to your game the last little while?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, after CME last year we had practice like two weeks at the Florida with Gareth, my manager, and my parents, too. I changed everything about my short game, like setup or clubs or like mind, everything.
And then he help me a lot on the course or off the course, too. So he came every weeks. I think ever weeks at the major and then some normal tournament, and then he checked every day about my putting setup and then chipping set up or ball position or everything. So I want to say to thank. Yeah, yeah.
Q. Just wondering with the play on No. 9, it went into the woods, right? Then you took a drop out of the woods, I believe.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
Q. How long was that putt when you made par?
JIN YOUNG KO: I would say four feet.
Q. Four feet?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
Q. And could you also talk -- you talked earlier about the fan support for Brooke, and you had some strong fan support, too. Tell us what that was like. Were they as loud as Brooke's fans?
JIN YOUNG KO: Anyway, I -- yeah, a lot; a lot of fans out here Canadian or Koreans, too. But I felt God is help me on the course. Then I thought God is cheer up to me, so doesn't matter about like all the crowd to Brooke or Nicole. Doesn't matter because God is help me, yeah.
Q. You've won four times this year. How did you celebrate your other wins and how will you celebrate this win in Canada?
JIN YOUNG KO: I didn't yet celebrate because I don't have much time in Korea with my parents. I always stay States and then Canada. I will after Portland going back to Korea and then I will celebrate with my friends and parents, my manager.
Q. Will you have a party?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, drinking. (Laughter.)
Q. Also, I understand you almost stayed in Korea for this week but you decided to come. Why did you decide to play in this event at the last minute?
JIN YOUNG KO: Well, I like Canada and then I like ice cap, cappuccino. Yeah, that's why I want to play this week.
THE MODERATOR: It's the simple things. Did you end up making it to Niagara Falls?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
THE MODERATOR: What were your thoughts on Niagara Falls?
JIN YOUNG KO: On Friday?
THE MODERATOR: Yes. What was it like?
JIN YOUNG KO: Scared. I scared.
THE MODERATOR: Anything further for Jin Young? All right. Congratulations; enjoy this. Do you have a trophy that's this big?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, it's fun.
THE MODERATOR: You'll find a place for it, right? Absolutely. Well congratulations.
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.
