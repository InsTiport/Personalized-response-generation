THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to welcome in Jin Young Ko, the Bank of Hope Founders Cup champion.  Jin Young, congratulations.   
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.   
THE MODERATOR: This is your third win on the LPGA Tour.  What did this win mean to you?   
JIN YOUNG KO: I would say I thought really can I do for win in the States?  Last year I think too much, so I lose a little bit confidence.  But my friends told me, You can do it.  Also my manager and my parents, my caddie, all people say, You can.   
So I got lots of confidence for this year.  Really good for third win in the States, so I'm really happy.   
THE MODERATOR: Do you feel relieved to get a win in the United States today?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, for sure.  Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Bogey-free 65 on Sunday here at Wildfire Golf Club.  What was working for your game today?   
JIN YOUNG KO: I would say just I like Dustin Johnson.  I heard from Jennifer Song yesterday.  She told me Dustin hit so bad he didn't angry.  Like clubs put in the bag and just walk.   
So I shocked a little bit, so I tried like Dustin yesterday and today.  I didn't like to him, but I'm just tried no angry, no happy, just focus.  Really good, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: You said in Australia your goal this year was to play happy.  Did you do that this week?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.  I was happy on weekend, on the weekend, because I had 7-under on Thursday and then even par on Friday.  I was little sad also, but I tried keep hard more on the weekend, so I got 15-under on the weekend.   
I'm really happy.   
THE MODERATOR: How will you celebrate?   
JIN YOUNG KO: I don't know.  I have to go to Carlsbad tonight so I think I can't.   
 Q.  Tell us about your caddie.  You just started working with him in Australia.  
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.   
THE MODERATOR: What's your relationship like with him?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Like I know Grace Park, she played before in LPGA Tour, and she used David Brooker before, so she introduced to me to David.  So, okay.   
And then I look up to David last year, and so he like me I like him, so we are good relationship now.   
THE MODERATOR: How does he help you on the golf course?   
JIN YOUNG KO: He's very cold on the course.  Like today he did fun, and then but sometimes serious, so that's help to me.   
THE MODERATOR: What did the win mean in front of the Founders and the little girls from Girls' Golf?   
JIN YOUNG KO: (Through translation.)  I want to say thank you to Founders.  I wouldn't have won if there was no Founders here, because if they weren't here we don't have a chance to win on this Wildfire Golf Course.  I really want to appreciate Founders and all the girls out here today and for the weekend.   
Thank you.   
THE MODERATOR: What advice do you have for some of those girls that would like to be like you one day?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Read a book lots and then just enjoy in life, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for our champion?   
 Q.  You had a duel with Nelly in Australia.  She's been playing so well lately.  How challenging was that, to beat her today and Jessica also?  
JIN YOUNG KO: (Through translation.)  She played well this year, so I think she's really good.  I'm just think about just me, not Nelly.   
Then also I have lots of birdie on today, so I have to.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  And then I don't know.  She's great, yeah.   
 Q.  What's the challenge been like adjusting to playing in the United States?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I had lots of pray to God and then like read a book a lot, hard practice, and then think about how make Korean food.  Yeah, so I miss Korea sometimes, but I'm doing really good in the States.   
THE MODERATOR: Who did you look up to when you were a young golfer?  Grace Park maybe?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Honestly, Se Ri Pak and then Grace Park and Hee-Kyung Seo; also Jiyai Shin.  Lots of Korean, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Did any of them give you advice before you joined the LPGA?   
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, for sure.  From Hee-Kyung.  Hee-Kyung told me, If you going to America it will be tired, but you need to inspiration for your life.  So, yeah, she's good, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: What were your goals this week when you got here?   
JIN YOUNG KO: I think better than course condition last year.  Like more birdie chance and then rough is gone.  Fairways nice and green should be little slow.   
But I thought many players lots of birdie on the tournament, so I had little bit pressure for birdies.  But I can, yeah, so I win.  Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: You have a win now and two top 3 finishes this season.  How much confidence do you have right now?   
JIN YOUNG KO: A lot also, but I'm try keep hard for practice, and then I have to checkup my swing or putting for tomorrow morning, so I need to go airport.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  You putt with the flag in a lot more than most of these girls.  What goes into your thinking on that?  
JIN YOUNG KO: (Through translation.)  Lots of players thinks if there is a pin in the ball might hit the pin and come out.  I think it's great to put the pin in because of -- the reason why is if there is a pin it makes easier for me to putt because it has a small target.   
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our champion?  Congratulations.   
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.
