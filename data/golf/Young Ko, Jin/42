 Q.  Jin Young Ko, the latest major champion.  You had not finished better than 26th here at Evian in your last three appearances.  What changed for you this week?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I think actually my game isn't really big change than last year.  Last year was little shorter my driver distance, but this year getting longer my driver distance.  And then I will try like little more (indiscernible) shot of my iron.   
So that's really good.  So I had great week really.   
 Q.  You looked very comfortable in the final group today.  Other players had some problems that you were playing alongside.  How comfortable were you out there?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I know they are my friends, like Hyo Joo and Sung Hyun and me.  We know so much.  So I thought last night I can do.  If play really good I can do win.   
So I will try focus on my game.  I never seen about other players shots or scores.  It's good to me, so I got win.   
 Q.  Focused on your own game.  You are projected to go back to No. 1 in the Rolex Women's World Rankings.  Last time you were No. 1 you said you felt a little bit too much pressure, like you should win every week.  How will you be different now as potentially the best player in the world?  
JIN YOUNG KO: I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just try same thing as this week.  I will find motivation of my golf on the course.   
So will be hopefully getting better.
