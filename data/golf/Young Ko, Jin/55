Q. What was today like for you out there?
JIN YOUNG KO: Windy on the course, so today was really tough to me, and all the players, but I really tried simple thinking and then shot by shot.
Q. What was the best part of your game today?
JIN YOUNG KO: I think driver shot.  I hit 14 shots on the tee but I miss just one shot or two shots, yeah.
Q. Have you done anything off the course this week fun?
JIN YOUNG KO: I like really British and the links course because in Korea, never play before the links course.
I did bicycling yesterday with my manager and I went to the river and then market.  I put on the helmet on my head and then sunglasses, and then I went to market.  So every people's look at me, oh, looks Asian, but really feels like Scottish.  They was surprised.
Q. Is this your first time playing links?
JIN YOUNG KO: Second time.  2015 at the RICOH British.
Q. Do you remember anything from that tournament that helped?
JIN YOUNG KO: Of course.  Three years ago, I finished second in the British Open.  I'm really close to win three years ago.  That's a good thing to me at the links course, yeah.
