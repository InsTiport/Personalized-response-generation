  Q. Jin Young, great round today.  Tell us how you felt you played today.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I had a lot of chance for birdie, but I missed a couple putts.
 But I'm still playing good today, so I had really fun out there, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
 Q. You shot two 71s and then a 68.  What do you think changed from yesterday to today?  I know they moved a lot of the tees up today.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yes, tee was way forward than last two days, so we had a lot of couple -- we had a lot of chance for birdie, so I had made a lot of putts.
 And then, well, I had good rest after yesterday, so that's why I play good today, I guess.
 Q. Nothing wrong with that.  We'll always take it.  Also has to be nice today with the beautiful weather.  What's it like being out there and seeing the course coming together on this beautiful day?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, I think California is really good for live place, but it's too expensive here.  I want to buy a house in here but I worried about taxes, tax.
 Yeah, but it was always looking good for a round the course and then views and a lot of flowers out there.
 So, I'm happy.
 Q. I would live here if I could.  I love it here.  So tell me what you hope to take from today into tomorrow's final round.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, I have -- I don't know, I will try get some more birdies tomorrow and we will just have fun.
 Q. You always have fun.  Thank you, Jin Young.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Thank you.
