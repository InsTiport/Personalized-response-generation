  Q. Jin Young Ko, we've seen these performances from you for quite some time.  But you think about the shortened season, just four events here in the U.S. and now you're the money title winner.
 What does it mean to you to win this event and to accomplish what you have in such a short time?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, yeah, I had good rest in Korea since ten months, and then I play just four events in U.S.
 But I had money title two years in a row, so, I don't know, just when I come back to U.S. when I played at the Pelican tournament I had feel really sad because my parents and friends, they are in Korea.  Just I lived here by myself.
 So I have to go back to Korea again, but after Pelican I had four weeks time, so I had really practice hard and I'm just -- I just want to play CME.
 But last week I had really good round and then I finished top two, so and then I can play here.  So I just want to thank God and I did nothing.  Just God makes everything.
 Q. The whole golf world has witnessed your talent the last several years.  But you're going up against some of the best players, your friend from back home, Sei Young.  How were you able to focus on your own game and not focus on what she was doing and get the job done?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yeah, it was tough because we play together last three days, and then we are good with each other, we are close, and then we played together in Korea a lot of times.  So, yeah, it was tough.  But it was competition, so I have to -- I had to win to her and by myself too.  So I'm say little sorry to Sei Young, but she played good as well.  I played little more better than her.
