Q. Well played.
JIN YOUNG KO: Thank you.
Q. Can I get you to first give me the lengths of your birdie putts for the last four holes?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, yeah.  No. 15, par-5, I had 84 meters to the pin from third shot, so I got 52.  I had three quarters in and like tap in.
Q. Tap in?  Wow.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes.
And then 16 was 131.  I got 9-iron.  I tried little three quarter, and then like just two feet.
Q. Stuffing it.
JIN YOUNG KO: Then 17 was 118 meters to the pin.  I got pitching wedge.  Lie was so bad, but I hit like six meters.  I make it.  I made it.
No. 18, par-5, I had 65 meters to the pin from third shot, so I got 60 degrees, three quarters, like six feet.
Q. Well done.  Well done.  So you must be feeling really good about your golf game on this golf course.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, today short game was really good inside 100 meters, so I had really comfortable with the wedge shots.
Many chance to birdie.
Q. I wanted to ask you, when you were No. 1 in the world, what was the toughest part about being No. 1, what you learned about yourself?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, when I was No. 10 in the ranking I can find about motivation under my goals, but when I was No. 1 I lost my motivation to golf.
So I want to find that but I couldn't.  I don't know why.  It was really great experience to me.  So if I can do one more, like will be hopefully better.
Q. Was it emotionally hard for you?
JIN YOUNG KO: No.  No just like find out about goal.
Q. A goal?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, a goal.  Because when I was world ranked No. 10 I want to finish just top 10, inside top 10.
But when I was No. 1 I have to No. 1 finish.
Q. You have to win.
JIN YOUNG KO: That is really hard to me, so that's why I playing not good, but not bad.
Q. You thought you had to win every week?
JIN YOUNG KO: Right.  Stupid thing, but happens.
Q. I think that's common.
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah.
Q. Have you talked to other players who were No. 1 in the past about their experience?
JIN YOUNG KO: No, not really.  I don't know why, but not really.
Q. Now that you've won a major championship, how do you feel different coming into majors being in contention?
JIN YOUNG KO: I played fourth time this tournament.  Four years ago my feeling was have to just make par, not get birdies.  Just like saving putts, make pars.
But now I can do aggressive on the course, like try to the pin.  Then my caddie is really good, knows this course, so he help me a lot.
So, yeah.  We are good team.
