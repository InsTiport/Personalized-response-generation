  Q. All right, here with Jin Young Ko fresh off your round here.  Tied for the lead after round one.  What stuck out to you today?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   I had great start of the year in the first tournament.  I had a lot of great shots and great putts.  I had little couple miss putt, short putt, but I had really great round so I'm really happy with it.  Can't wait for next three days.
 Q. What do you like most about this golf course here?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Well, first thing is great view on the course, especially on the back nine is perfect.  So it makes me little more happier on the course.
 So I can't wait for tomorrow.
 Q. How excited were you to get to the first tee?  It's been a couple months since we've seen you at CME.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yes.  I felt just two weeks ago, I just finished two weeks ago at the CME I felt.  It's been maybe two months or three months, two and a half.
 But my swing feeling is good and the putting is good, everything is good.  Weather is perfect.  My mind is really clearing, so I can't wait.
 Q. I noticed I said you had a couple short putts.  Is that something to look forward to and improve upon tomorrow?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Yes, because in the morning it was a lot of shade on the greens so I couldn't read for the speed and break as well.
 But back nine everything was perfect, the green speed, everything.  So I read really well the green for the break, so I made a lot of putts.
 Q. What does it mean to have such a strong start in your first event back in 2021?
 JIN YOUNG KO:   My goal is really highest goal for this year, so I have to great start of the year.  I had great round.  I'm happy with it.
 Q. I remember you said you wouldn't tell us your goals, so I'll take that as a little hint.  Thank you.  Appreciate you taking the time.
 JIN YOUNG KO:   Thanks.
