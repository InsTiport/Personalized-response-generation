Q. What a way to begin the week.
CHRIS WILLIAMS: It is.  I mean, thank goodness the weather improved.  I was very nervous when I was teeing off there, so, but I hit my second to six inches and it was just the best start I ever had and I just started to relax a little bit for about four holes and my game started coming through and I played steady golf all day.  No mistakes, wasn't in any trouble, I think I only missed one or two greens only and no fairways, so I was really solid today.
Q. 3-under through the first day, you must have been feeling really good.
CHRIS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I hit a lot of good shots and good recovery shots, there was one great chip I had on the 7th, that's all it was, and then a couple good putts.  And it was quite an easy round.
Q. The nicest thing about this scorecard that you'll take away is the fact that you had no bogeys out there?
CHRIS WILLIAMS: No bogeys.  Very nice to do that.  That doesn't often happen on such a tough course like this and it's a nice start, it's a nice feeling, and I can just think about it for the rest of the day.
Q. How was the course playing?  The conditions today were really good, but we have had some rain.
CHRIS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's playing its full length.  I got here on Monday and it's still playing quite long.  There was no run, even on any drive out there, maybe three feet at the most.  So it's playing its full length.  The greens are a little slower than they have been in the past few years, but I think they will get quicker as it goes on.
Q. One shot off the lead as it stands at the moment.  What are your thoughts going into round two tomorrow?
CHRIS WILLIAMS: Not a thing.  Not thinking of a thing at all.  I'm just thinking about lunch and there's a lot of golf out there still.
