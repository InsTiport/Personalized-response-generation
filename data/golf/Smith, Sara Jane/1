Q.   Pretty good round out there, but felt like maybe could have been a little bit better coming in? 
SARAH JANE SMITH:   Yeah, yeah, I missed a couple early and then had a couple of bad shots in the last few holes.
But it was all right.

Q.   What happened at the end with the shot you said? 
SARAH JANE SMITH:   On the Par‑3 I hit it in the bunker on the right‑hand side.   Just didn't have the best lie.   Chunked it a little bit and made bogey there.
Only had 6‑iron into the Par‑5 and made par, so...

Q.   Got to feel pretty good about where you are heading into the weekend?
SARAH JANE SMITH:   Yeah, yeah, no, it's definitely nice to be in the last few groups.   Feel like my game is in a good spot.

Q.   Is it kind of disappointing a little bit that the season is ending playing so well right now?
SARAH JANE SMITH:   A little bit, yeah.   Actually I started working with Kevin (indiscernible) in late July, and it's sort of all coming together now. 
But that's all right.   Ready for next year.

Q.   What were the changes he made?   What were you all working on?
SARAH JANE SMITH:   A bunch of stuff.   I had gotten my swing in not a very good spot, so we worked a little bit on that.   Just in the last couple weeks we've done a lot on the short game.

Q.   What were the swing changes?
SARAH JANE SMITH:   I tend to get it really low, so we worked on getting it a lot higher.   I've sort of always worked on that and never been able to get it, and he's sort of gave me a few extra little things that made it a little easier.

Q.   Very cool.   How tough are the conditions out there today?   It was pretty windy, wasn't it?
SARAH JANE SMITH:   Yeah, the last nine holes it got a little gusty.   There was some pretty strong gusts, so it was tough to judge on a few holes.

Q.   What are your plans for the off‑season? 
SARAH JANE SMITH:   Going home to Australia. 

Q.   How long will you be there?   Two months? 
SARAH JANE SMITH:   No, a month.   We'll go home, spend a month at home, then come back for the start of the season here and then go back to Australia.
