Q. Michelle, a lovely round.  Sprinkled lots of birdies over this golf course.
MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.  Yeah, I feel like this golf course you have to make birdies to try and keep up.
Q. It's seriously tough.  How good is the play?  We're seeing eagles and birdies all over.
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, yeah, for sure.  Feels like par is definitely not good enough, and sometimes birdies aren't good enough.  Just trying to keep my head above water right now.
Q. You must be very proud of what you achieved in the lasts 12 months.  At the beginning of the season last year you weren't playing so well and you had that inspiration of making the Solheim Cup team.  You must be very pleased with what you've done.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, definitely every week I play I definitely feel more confidence.  That's what I'm trying to do every week, is build up my confidence.  I had fun out there, so I feel like that's when I play my best.  Just really trying to go out there and have fun.
Q. You're certainly having fun.  We saw yesterday you had a bandage on your hand.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.
Q. You're okay?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm okay.  Just been a little bit of a struggle the last couple years.  Been on a good program recently, so just really trying to manage the pain, and it's been good.
Q. I am loving the look in 2018 believe.  Talk us through the hair and the color.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I had really long hair.  Obviously had the neck issue last year so I had to cut all my hair off because it was so heavy.
Yeah, just trying new things.
Q. How much are you enjoying this Asian swing?  You always come out.  These are great tournaments.
MICHELLE WIE: I love it.  I think these are two great tournaments; they've been great supporters of the LPGA and a lot of history.
Just great to be out here playing in front of the Thai fans.  They're so supportive.  It's been great.
Q. How difficult will it be?  You're a few shots behind at the moment.  What do you need to do this weekend?
MICHELLE WIE: Make a lot more birdies.
Q. You could do that.  You've got the distance.  How much is distance a factor on this golf course?
MICHELLE WIE: Definitely think it helps.  Definitely have some reachable par-5s.  Try to take better advantage of that on the weekend.  Yeah, definitely just try to have more wedges in.
Q. 5-under round, 7 birdies, 2 bogeys.  Looked to be pretty easy for you out there on the golf course, especially on the back nine.  How do you feel?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I feel good.  Definitely had two bogeys I made that were extremely stupid.  I'll try to avoid that over the weekend and try to do better on par-5s.
Yeah, pretty happy with how I played today, and hopefully on the weekend I can make more birdies.
Q. You came oh, so close an 18.  About how long was that putt and how frustrating is that?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, considering I hit it off a tent, you know, I'm pretty happy with that.  Could have been a lot worse.  It was pretty close, that putt.
I thought it was for sure going in with how downhill it was.  Yeah, nothing you can really do about it.
Q. Adventures with Michelle Wie.  I would think you would be getting into some adventures maybe with your food choices.  What do you like to enjoy?
MICHELLE WIE: Thai food for sure.  My you can't come to Thailand and not eat Thai food.  So Pad Thai, green curry, mango sticky rice every day much.
