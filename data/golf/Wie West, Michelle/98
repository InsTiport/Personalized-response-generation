 Q.   Out here with Michelle Wie, finished 4â€‘under today for the tournament.   How was it out there?   
MICHELLE WIE:   It was good.   I mean, obviously the back nine didn't go as well as I wanted to.   I just missed a couple putts.   But feeling good for the weekend and excited for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   You had a great opening nine today on the course.   What kind of changed for you when you made the turn?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Nothing, just hit a couple bumps on the greens and just didn't make a couple putts.
