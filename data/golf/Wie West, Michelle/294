 Q. What happened today, Michelle?
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, it was a little disappointing. I hit the ball really well, especially toward the end. I hit it here and there. I got a couple bad breaks. 
 You know, didn't really get the speed right for my putts. Diana played really well and she made a lot of shots today. I'll get it right and, you know, hopefully I'll have a lot of birdies.

 Q. How much did the speed have to do with it?
 MICHELLE WIE: I felt like I was hitting the ball pretty well but a couple shots here and there worked out bad. Maybe they would have come out a little differently. I think I'm hitting the ball solid. I have to work out a couple other things.

 Q. Were you confident? Were you standing over the ball confident?
 MICHELLE WIE: Oh, yeah. I mean I was confident. Like I say, couple of bad breaks here and there, you know, but a yard here, a yard there, putt here, putt there and that makes a world of difference.

 Q. You got some good breaks, though, like on 7 the ball was going out of bounds. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. Like I said, you know, golf is golf, you know.

 Q. Do you feel like you need one round or one tournament to sort of kick-start, get you going back where you were before or you need longer practice?
 MICHELLE WIE: No. I think that it's going to come in time. I'm not there.

 Q. What was the most frustrating part of this round for you?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think that I wound up hitting the ball solid but they didn't come out.

 Q. Knowing how well you played in the past, when you play, you know, a round today where you don't start off and the score doesn't reflect it, is it more frustrating?
 MICHELLE WIE: Especially people see your score and not how you play and how I feel like I was hitting the ball solid.
