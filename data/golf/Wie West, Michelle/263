 Q. Christina, this was a little bit lopsided. Are you surprised? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yeah, well, anything can happen in match play. Tania and Helen were an amazing pairing yesterday. They played some fantastic golf, and they were 3-under through two holes. I said, all right, if that's how they want to play, that's how we're going to have to win. We're going to have to win with birdies. 
 Michelle played such fan phenomenal golf out there, it was great. I was able to bink my drive out there and kind of cozy it up with a 4-iron up to the front of the green and just two-putt from 80 feet. She's all like, oh, I'm 180, I'll stick it to a foot and a half. I'm saving the pars. 
 Bottom line, we're a team, and we had some fantastic chemistry out there, and I'm just so damn proud of her right now.

 Q. You were trying to get her to dance to celebrate, but you couldn't quite get her to. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: I'll get her dancing, don't you worry.

 Q. Michelle, this has got to be a lot of fun. You're hitting your stride, second day, still some golf to play. How do you feel about today?
 MICHELLE WIE: I feel great. You can see the sun out here today. When I heard I was getting paired with Christina, you should have heard my scream. It was so loud in the players' room last night. I'm just so excited. I have fun with her. I think we have great chemistry. It was a lot of fun today. She's a great partner. She hit the ball so well today and putted so fantastically, I was just so glad to be along for the ride. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Anything can happen in match play. All you need is a little momentum. There were a lot of chances that were missed early on in the matches. There were a lot of chances that were made. We squeaked by on a couple of holes, we're not going to lie. We were very fortunate to have won some of the holes that we did and to have halved some of the holes that we did. But that's the beauty of match play and the magic of Solheim.

 Q. Are you guys also a great pairing because you can bring out -- get her out of her shell a little bit?
 CHRISTINA KIM: There is no "shell" in Michelle. It's with a c-h. This is Michelle.

 Q. She's not as outgoing as you, though. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Who is? We have great chemistry. We're both Korean-Americans and damn proud of it. We're going out and enjoying ourselves and trying to play some fantastic golf and doing our best to bring that Cup home. 

 Q. Were you surprised at the bogeys? The Europeans had a couple of bogeys out there. Were you surprised at that?
 CHRISTINA KIM: No, this golf course is so challenging that anything can happen. 
 MICHELLE WIE: They tuck these pins. They're not much. We're all playing really aggressively.
 CHRISTINA KIM: That's what match play is all about. You can go ahead and explode on one hole and you're only one down or whatever. It's a very challenging golf course. Mr. Rich should be proud of the fact that we're not completely tearing it up.
