  MICHELLE WIE:   I just hung in there all day today, and a shame how it ended.   But I have two more days to go, so hopefully I can shoot a lot under par.  
   
 Q.   You said it's been hard going.   Can you describe what's been going on?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I went to the ER on Monday.   I had a bit of a food poisoning I guess.   A bit of a rough journey to here.   I'm now starting to eat solid food, which is great.   I felt a lot better out there today, so hopefully over the weekend, can gain a little more strength.  
   
 Q.   How difficult does it make playing out here in these conditions as well?  
MICHELLE WIE:   It makes it very difficult.   There was a point yesterday where I didn't think I was going to make it.   I felt like I was going to faint every time I stood up.   
So it's been a bit rough, but felt a lot better today, still the remnants of it but like I said hopefully over the weekend, I can just get a little bit stronger.
