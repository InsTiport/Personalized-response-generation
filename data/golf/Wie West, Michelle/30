Q. What an emotional victory.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's great.  I don't know what's going on.
Q. When you started the day five back, did you think you had a realistic chance of winning?
MICHELLE WIE: You know, I wanted to.  I wanted really badly to win, especially after what happened last year, I had some unfinished business here.  I knew if I shot almost 7-, 8-under, I'd have a chance.
Q. Given what was at stake, how proud are you of what you just achieved?
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, I'm so proud of me and my caddie and my entire team.  It's been a long time since I've been up here, so it feels pretty good.  It feels great.
Q. The last win you had was a major championship, the 2014 U.S. Open.  Your fifth win now on the LPGA?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, this is Asia's major, and HSBC has been such a great supporter of women's golf and they always have a world-class event.  So for me to win this event, it just means the world to me.
Q. Anybody else you'd like to thank?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'd like to thank HSBC, like I said, for hosting this tournament and support through many, many years.
Singapore Tourism Board, Singapore is definitely one of my favorite spots to be.
I'd like to thank Sentosa Development Corporation, Sentosa Golf Club, and all the sponsors, Rolex, Singapore airlines, RICOH, Fairmont, the LPGA officials, IMG, and the volunteers and marshals.  It was not cool out here.  It was really warm, and for us to play, I can only imagine how difficult it was to volunteer, and I really appreciate the effort.
And all the fans that stuck out here, I don't know how you guys watched in this heat, but thank you for supporting me all four days.
And my family, my friends, my caddie -- very good on 18, and my coach, David Leadbetter and my sponsors, Nike, Callaway, OMEGA, MGM, thank you for never stop believing in me.  This was a great moment.
