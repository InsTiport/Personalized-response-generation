 Q.  Exactly what was the issue out there?  
MICHELLE WIE: I just kind of felt like -- back in Australia I kind of hurt my back a little bit, but feeling okay.  Just hit one shot that was a little bit out of sync and kind of threw my hips out of place.  But I'm okay, just hung in there today.  I think it was just a lot of golf.  The two full warm-ups, played how many holes, 28 holes.  Just not a young stallion anymore, I guess.   
 Q.  You've dealt with this before; how do you get it right for tomorrow?  
MICHELLE WIE: You know, I'm excited.  I think hopefully I go out a little bit later tomorrow, get some sleep, sleep past 4:00 a.m.  I'll be good.  Just going to go see the physios for a little bit, be fresh and ready to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  On the positive side, you've really been working hard on your putting.  You had a lot of par saves drop today.  How confident are you with the putter right now, especially going into Sunday?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it feels good to see my hard work pay off.  I spent a lot of time inside five, ten feet today, and with my back and everything, just grinding it out there.  I made a lot of good par putts, and I feel really good about it.  I wish I made a little more birdies on the back nine, but I'm still in position I feel like, and hopefully go out there tomorrow and shoot as low as I can.
