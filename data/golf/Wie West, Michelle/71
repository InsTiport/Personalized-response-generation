 Q.  How about a top-five finish at this event, how do you feel the week went?  
MICHELLE WIE: Overall, I can't complain, but right now it stings a little bit.  I played hard.  Just a couple of putts didn't drop in and I just missed a couple.  Just that one hole I missed two short ones.  But I played well today.   
I think I was just a little amped up today and my irons were going a little bit further, so I just wasn't hitting them as close as I was all week.   
I played solidly today.  Just a couple putts didn't go in, and Inbee played really well.  Obviously I wanted to walk away with the trophy, but there's so many leaps and strides forward that I made this week.  I'm really proud of myself.   
 Q.  Must give you confidence going into the West Coast Swing.  
MICHELLE WIE: For sure.  I'm going to ride the momentum and try to ride it out during the West Coast Swing.  Extremely confident about my game.  Like I said, I just made so much progress this week and I'm going to try to ride it forward.   
 Q.  The way you kept going after that mishap, you didn't show any signs of being uptight.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, stuff happens.  Stuff happens sometimes.  Sometimes you just 4-putt and you've just got to carry on with your life.   
But after that, the next hole, the sixth hole, that putt looked like it was going to go in.  And every putt after that, I just felt like it was going to go in.  It just didn't drop after that.  I made a couple of long ones early on.  I had good speed and I had good roll, and that's all I can do on these greens.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about, are you surprised at how well Inbee has putted, given it's her second tournament back?  That usually takes a while to get going.  
MICHELLE WIE: No, I don't think so.  She never really practices putting that much, and I think she just sees the line and she's a good putter.  She played great today.
