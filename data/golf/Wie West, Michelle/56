Q. So what was it like playing together in that kind of round?  How much fun was it in front of your hometown fans?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it was fun.  All my friends came out today.  I just couldn't get anything going along the last three days, so it was nice to make some birdies finally, came out of the gates pretty hot, so it's always fun to shoot 4-under par.
Q. Do you feel like you have a little bit of momentum going forward into the next tournament?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  I'm excited to go back home to Florida to just unpack my suitcases.  It's been a five-week road trip, and it's been nice to come home and just sleep in my own bed.  But yeah, just definitely going to get it together, regroup for Dallas, keep building on the momentum.
Q. Looked like you were having fun out there.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.  It's always fun to play in front of the home crowd on your home course, and what more can you ask.
Q. What are your biggest takeaways from this week?
MICHELLE WIE: I had a lot of fun.  I think just keep building.  Just a lot of positives from this week, a couple of things that I need to work on for the next tournament, but a lot of positives, I'm just going to keep riding the momentum.
Q. Do you miss Hawai'i when you go back home?
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, yeah, for sure.  It's so far from Florida.  But I have a couple days before I go back, so I'm just going to enjoy myself, eat all the food I can, try to squeeze as much as I can.
