MICHELLE WIE: (From Twitter) The U.S. Open is by far one of my favorite tournaments and I was looking forward to playing this event all year. I SO BADLY wanted to play today and the rest of the week. I have been battling a neck injury & have been receiving treatment everyday in order to be able to play. Unfortunately based on the short turnaround from last nightâs round to this morning, I havenât been able to recover enough to play to my full potential today. I am confident with the continued treatment, I will be at a 100% by the Scottish and British Open. Thank you all for your support and well wishes.
