Q.   Good playing. 
MICHELLE WIE:   Thank you.

Q.   What went well out there?
MICHELLE WIE:   Just iron play was good.   Just put in a lot of close shots.   Didn't really take advantage of par‑5s, which I kind of want to tomorrow.   It was a good day.   It was consistent.

Q.   I know you said you avoided the par train there toward the end.   What happened on those last eight holes? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Just didn't make a lot of putts.   The greens were a little bit bumpy with the greens being so soft.   Just left myself a couple of tricky ones.   I hit them well.   I putted well.   Had good speed.   Hopefully tomorrow morning can get back on the birdie train.

Q.   How nice is it to get a good round under your belt?
MICHELLE WIE:   Feels good, especially the first round.   It just makes things a lot easier.

Q.   How is it being back here in Portland?   I know it's the home of Nike. 
MICHELLE WIE:   It's great.   We had a product meeting.   It's nice to be around Nike campus.   It's great to be back on this golf course.   Safeway just always hosts a really great event.   It's a tournament that we always look forward to, so it's really nice to be back.

Q.   How are you feeling after the past three weeks?
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, I was absolutely dead last week, but this week ‑‑
I mean, I'm still sleeping 12hours every night, but I'm feeling a little better during the day.   So I'm feeling less like a zombie.
