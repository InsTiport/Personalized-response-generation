   THE MODERATOR: 3-under par today, with a huge delay there. Just talk about the day in general. 
 MICHELLE WIE: It was a long day. I feel like I've been out here for a long time, but it was a fun day, a really fun group with Suzann and Yani, and I'm looking forward to the next two days.
 THE MODERATOR: Just talk about the delay, what kind of things you did. How do you get through that mentally? 
 MICHELLE WIE: It was a pretty long delay. It was kind of frustrating because it was like 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It was unfortunately a dangerous situation. There was nothing you could do about it. So we just sat around for a little bit.
 It was really funny because we all raced to the range even before they called it, so it was pretty funny. 

 Q. You had a couple of spectators walking across the fairway on the 10th just as you were about to tee off. How distracting was that?
 MICHELLE WIE: It's not bad. I think like there haven't been a lot of golf tournaments here. Aside from that the spectators have been very respectful of us. They just really don't know what to do. 
 But they're very respectful, and I'm really excited that they call came out to watch. They all seem really excited to come, and I hope there's a lot more fans that come out in the next two days.

 Q. How would you sum up your form today?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think I did pretty well. You know, I'm just going out there just grinding. It's very hot, so you're taking one shot at a time. 
 I left a lot of putts in the end, but I feel like I'm just going to have to keep grinding and doing better tomorrow.

 Q. Do you feel like it will have any effect tomorrow, because as you said, you just had a very long day?
 MICHELLE WIE: I'll make sure I get some good rest in. I don't think we'll start too early tomorrow. Thank God we finished today so we don't have to wake up at like 5 tomorrow, but it should be good.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 MICHELLE WIE: Oh, I just three-putted. Thank you.
