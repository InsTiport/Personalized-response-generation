 Q.   Michelle, you just shot 67 here in the third round, great round today, a lot of low numbers went out in the morning today; did you come into this round thinking, let's be aggressive, I have to go low?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, for sure, I came out the afternoon looking at the leaderboard and saw a lot of 9‑unders, a lot of 8‑unders and was kind of like, I have to get moving today.   Just one of those days I couldn't get anything to the hole but scrimmaged and shot 5‑under and really happy to be in the position that I am right now and I'm just really excited for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You looked very confident over your putts, a lot of long putts, you were getting very, very close.   How did you stay confident and try to not get too far ahead of yourself without those dropping?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, I made a bomb on the first hole, and I think I just gained a lot of confidence from there.   You know, I had a lot of chances.   I didn't really put anything close to the hole today so I had a lot of 40‑footers today unfortunately.   So I guess I just got used to it.  
   
 Q.   Now you said you feel so comfortable with your game, your goal is to be consistent and you're doing just that, how do you feel being in contention for Sunday, what's the goal for tomorrow?  
MICHELLE WIE:   I'm excited.   I'm just so excited to be in this position that I have a chance.   It's just fun being in contention so I'm just going to make the most of it tomorrow and go out there and enjoy myself.
