PAUL ROVNAK:  Michelle, thanks for speaking with us, another solid round.  You're 7 under for the tournament and it should be an interesting day tomorrow.
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, I felt pretty good out there.  I felt like I hit the ball pretty solidly.  Could have done a lot better, but still happy the way my score turned out to be.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Can you take us over that score card?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, 7, I hit a 9 iron to about three feet.

Then on 8, I hit a 6 iron to about nine feet.

Then 9, I was in the right rough, in the fairway rough, and I hit a really good shot.  Like I hit it right where I wanted to and I hit the front of the green and rolled all the way over into the long stuff.  Then I hit a pretty good chip from there and had about a 12 foot putt for par.  I just chipped a 6.

12, I hit an 8 iron to about three feet.

13, I hit a 5 iron to about eight feet.

15, I hit a 3 iron.  I put it on in two and 2 putted from about 50 feet.

18, I hit my 3 iron to about 12 feet and then missed it for eagle.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  It's a little frustrating because I could have played a lot better.  I mean, the longest putt I made today was nine feet.

I mean, compared to the way I hit the ball, I should have shot a lot better, but I'm still very happy with the way my score is.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I mean, I just felt really good with my iron shots and stuff like that.  It's one of those    well, not one of those days.  Today I had a lot of good putts and I'm very happy I made a couple of them.  I feel good that I played pretty well.
Q.  What happened on 17?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, 17, I hit a great drive.  Finally I made it to the fairway; I was really happy.  I hit a 3 iron and I pulled it ever so slightly to the left, and I was kind of right in front of the lip on the bunker.  Then I just couldn't really hit it and trickled on to the green and missed about a 9 foot putt for birdie.
