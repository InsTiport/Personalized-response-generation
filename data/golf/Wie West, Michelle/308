   COLIN CALLANDER:  We have Michelle Wie.  Some comments about your round.   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I thought it was somewhat disappointing and somewhat successful.  I played pretty solid.  I played the shots I wanted to hit.  I left myself some easy reasonable putts.  Unfortunately the back nine, I was unlucky with a couple of bounces and my second shots got left with some really tough putts.  Overall I felt like it was a really solid round.  I felt like I got it going, made some birdies and I think that, you know, level par here is pretty good; wet, cold, 7.25 in the morning when I was freezing, so it was pretty good.   
 COLIN CALLANDER:  First thing this morning I saw you were wearing mitts-- keeping your wrist warm?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, definitely No. 1 priority this morning was keeping my left wrist warm.   
 COLIN CALLANDER:  How was it out there?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  It was pretty cold and pretty hard.  A couple shots stung a little bit but I was playing really well and there was no lasting pain and I just have to rest it for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Was your wrist sore when you hit out of deep rough on the 14th?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  It wasn't too bad.  I just kind of pitched out of there but it wasn't too bad.  It was a good positive.   
  
  Q.  Was that round the best round you've had since your injury?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I would say since I really played my best last year, really last summer I was playing really solidly.  Back nine I hit some solid shots, but had a couple of bad bounces and luck has a lot to do on this golf course, but on the back nine, unfortunately I got some bad bounces.  I had a really solid round today.  I just have to keep it going.   
 COLIN CALLANDER:  Let's go through your birdies and bogeys.   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Fourth hole, I think I hit a driver and I think I hit a -- something less than an 8-iron for sure and then I had like a 10-foot putt for birdie.   
 5, then I hit a driver and then I hit a hybrid on to the green and had a nice, 60-yard putt.  Made a nice lag putt, had about eight feet for my birdie putt.   
 10, I hit my had I bride knock-down and I hit a 52-degree wedge to about four feet and made that.   
 11, I hit a great 6-iron shot.  Unfortunately I played it too well and completely held off the wind and just had a really tough putt from the left side of the green.  I made like a 4-foot putt.   
 14, I hit a driver down the middle and then I hit the drive for my second shot which I completely blocked to the right and then I was in the heather, like the really long rough and kind of pitched out of there, was short of the green and then hit a chip shot about 12 feet short and then missed that.   
 15, I hit the hybrid knock-down again and hit a 6-iron, and that also was a really good 6-iron shot, just kind of bounced right when it should have bounced left.  Kind of left myself like a 20-yard putt, which is really tricky.  I had about like an eight-foot putt that I missed.   
  
  Q.  You had to manufacture a lot of shots today, knock-down shots; how much fun is that?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, it is a lot of fun.  It's different.  There's always several options.  You can hit like a 5-iron, the 6-iron, the 8-iron all in the same place and it will give you all different things.  It just opens the door for so many different kind of shots.   
 I like playing that kind of golf and I'm really glad that my wrist is a lot stronger now and I can hit those fade shots, those low shots.  I really feel like my game is getting on and hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to do the same.   
  
  Q.  Are those shots something you have had to learn for this week?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I've always had those shots because I've always played in the wind in Hawaii.  I've always been a wind player, so kind of just hitting those shots -- they are always fun to hit, just hitting full shot all the time is a little bit worrying on the range.  So hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to do -- manufacture a lot more shots.   
  
  Q.  How close do you think you are to getting back to your top form?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think I'm pretty close.  I feel like my wrist is getting stronger and stronger.  It's hurting less and less which is good.  I just have to keep my head on and be patient and not be too -- not rush into it.  It's not like, oh, I'm starting to play better now so I should be where I was.  But I just have to keep on being patient like I was this whole year and just take it slowly because it's still in the process of recovering and I just have to be patient.   
  
  Q.  You weren't in any bunkers today but you did come close a couple of times didn't you?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I hit some good shots today.  Got a little lucky on a couple of holes, a couple really close, but tomorrow I'm going to try to stay farther from the bunkers.  You know, I think I'm on the right track.   
  
  Q.  Does this give you more confidence?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I think it boosted my confidence a lot because I was able to, you know, hit a lot of shots that I wanted to hit and I hit them really solidly.   
 You know, like I said, even though my back nine wasn't as strong as my front nine, I felt like I played almost the same but unfortunately got some bad breaks on the back nine.  I feel like I played really solidly today, and just playing here and just being here is just a lot of fun.   
  
  Q.  How frustrating was it for you when you were injured?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Obviously it wasn't the funnest time for me.  I mean, you know, it was really frustrating because I thought before -- right after I hurt my wrist, right after I felt, I would be like, oh, maybe just a couple of weeks off and I'll be back where I was.   
 But I hit the cold, hard truth that it was not going to get better fast enough for me.  I just had a really tough time because I wanted to go out there and I wanted to hit balls for hours and hours because I wasn't hitting the ball great, but I was limited; I couldn't.  I could only hit the ball for 30 minutes at a time.   
 It was frustrating for me, more frustrating for me than depressing for me.  It was frustrating because I couldn't go out there and work on my game like I want to.   
 I feel like I'm just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel now and I feel like my wrist is getting stronger and stronger.  Like I said, I'm not going to jump back into it.  I'm just going to be patient with myself and keep my head on and see where it takes me.   
  
  Q.  Did you find it scary when you're on the first tee not really knowing how the wrist was going to feel?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, obviously the last thing that you're thinking of is the ball in the fairway.  You know, when your wrist is hurting that much, in the back of your min, you're thinking about 'how is it not going to hurt when I hit it.'  And unfortunately there's a certain point about how much you can compensate in your swing, and unfortunately I just couldn't really compensate it as well as I could.   
 But there wasn't -- I wasn't that confident off the tee but I don't think fear is the right word.  I think it was not being able to be in the present when you're thinking about something else.  I felt like I wasn't really the in the present, and right now I'm just trying to focus on being in the present and focus on playing the game again.  I feel like I'm able to do that because my wrist is not as hurting as much, and you know, I'm just trying to be a lot more patient with myself.   
  
  Q.  Are you back to 100%   
 MICHELLE WIE:  No, I don't think so.  I think that I have to work on it a little bit more and get a little bit stronger and hopefully by doing that, hopefully I'll be stronger than I was before.   
  
  Q.  Yardage-wise, how much shorter are you?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I mean, I don't know, I guess I'm a little bit shorter, about ten yards shorter than I was really.  You about but, you know, it varies; sometimes I can kill the ball and sometimes I can't.   
  
  Q.  Yesterday, you talked about having to aim at some pretty strange targets. Today, did you mean to go where you went on the 3rd?   
MICHELLE WIE:  Oh, that was a missed shot completely.  I wasn't aiming at the fence.   
  
  Q.  What was the line?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  The line for me there, it's a blind shot, so I don't like really know where that is.  The camera tower I think. I don't remember, it was not on the line where I wanted to hit it obviously.   
 COLIN CALLANDER:  Thank you, Michelle.
