 Q.  What a fabulous comeback.  
MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about how you turned it around after such a tough start.  
MICHELLE WIE: It was definitely a battle.  Definitely proud of myself for coming back.  Front nine felt just really rusty.  Just had no rounds of golf in me, so I was just out there figuring things out.   
The string of birdies definitely helped my confidence a lot and felt really good, so hopefully tomorrow I can keep the momentum going and make some more birdies.   
 Q.  You must be very proud after such a tough start.  How do you tough and how did you turn it around?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, 5-over in eight holes, it was pretty tough.  I knew that I just needed to just get the rust out and get my confidence back up and see what the little white ball is doing again.   
Yeah, felt really good making birdie on 18 and 1 and 2 and 3, so that was really good helpful me.   
 Q.  Everyone is saying the conditions are really, really tough.  It's windy and everything.  
MICHELLE WIE: For sure.   
 Q.  That makes it almost a better score.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, felt like every hole was a dead left to right wind on the back nine at one point.
