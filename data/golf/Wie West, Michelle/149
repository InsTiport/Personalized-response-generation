Q.   We are here with Michelle Wie after a fabulous second round, sitting now at 9‑under par for the tournament.   What was really working well for you out there?
MICHELLE WIE:   Just couldn't get anything going today, but I had a good stretch of four holes.   You know, I hit it close those four holes.   Just need to make more putts this weekend.

Q.   Just overall how is the state of your game right now?   What really do you think is working well because you've been playing so well over all the events so far this year?
MICHELLE WIE:   My main goal is consistency, and I feel like I'm just going to go out there and make pars, make birdies and hit it in the fairways and on the greens and see what happens.

Q.   And what do you think the keys are on this golf course?   What do you have to do to really be successful out there?
MICHELLE WIE:   I think just leaving it on the right part of the greens.   There are some tricky putts out there, but mainly just keep it in the fairway and hit it on cue to the hole.

Q.   You were at 10‑under heading into par‑5. 
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I hit it into the bunker, and I thought I hit a really good bunker shot, and I flew it 15 yards past the green.   So that was a good one. 
But it was just one of those holes where I thought I hit a good shot, and everyone just kind of looked back, and it went over everyone's head.

Q.   Obviously given you were 10‑under kind of disappointed the way the round ended?
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, for sure.   All day today I just felt like I could have shot a lot more under par.   Just left a lot of putts out there, but I still have two more days out there.   It's not Sunday yet, so I'm excited that I have the opportunity, I'm in contention right now.   So it's fun.
