 Q.  The last few holes, you played pretty well, but you couldn't get the birdie putts to drop but then you made that chip-in for birdie.  
MICHELLE WIE: I know, that was it all day.  I did not know putts could lip out at some speeds that I was hitting it.  I hit some great putts.  Just, you know, didn't go in.  You have those days.  But I'm excited for the weekend.   
 Q.  Tell us about the chip-in.  Did you see on the way it was going to be close?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I hit it in the left bunker and then I kind of hit the lip of the bunker and then I hit the wood in and I pulled the wood and I was in a situation where I didn't want to be in.  I kind of hit a flop shot and kind of worked out perfectly.   
 Q.  How far were you on that?  
MICHELLE WIE: I was way left of the green.  So I don't know, I was like 20 yards left.   
 Q.  And you changed clubs with your second shot on 9.  What were you between?  
MICHELLE WIE: I just had a really bad lie.  You know, just wanted to make sure I got it out there.   
 Q.  What did you hit?  You can't remember?  
MICHELLE WIE: I hit an 11-wood.  (Laughter).   
 Q.  Is this the first time you've ever had an 11-wood in the bag?  
MICHELLE WIE: I love it.   
 Q.  What do you love about it?  
MICHELLE WIE: It's so easy to hit.  It's easy to hit than a played 5-iron, let me tell you that.   
 Q.  How far do you carry?  
MICHELLE WIE: Same as my 5-iron.   
 Q.  Which is?  
MICHELLE WIE: 180.   
 Q.  And despite the bogey on 9, your position, what do you think?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I played great today.  I just missed so many putts.  It was one of those days where I could have shot 63 easily.  But I played myself in good position and I'm just going to try my hardest this weekend.   
 Q.  Your buddy, Danielle Kang, is having a good tournament.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I saw that.   
 Q.  Can you talk about how she's been playing of late?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, she's playing great.  I think she's been striking the ball really solidly.  She's always been a solid putter, and you know, she just believes in herself.  It was fun to watch her on TV this morning.  It gave me some motivation this afternoon.  I was trying to make some birdies coming in to try to get paired with her.  Fell short a little bit, but hopefully on Sunday.
