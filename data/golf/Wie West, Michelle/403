 Q. What a finish, a birdie on the last hole to end the day.  How do you feel about today? 
MICHELLE WIE: I had a lot of (inaudible) I turned around, and none of my putts went in except for my par putt, so if I made all my birdie butts, then I'd be like 8 or 7 under, so it's pretty bad, but overall, I think I played okay because I struggled a bit out there, and I just covered myself up and I was really calm, and this morning I was so tired I couldn't get out of bed.  I was, like, no, so I think I played good because I was really tired today and I think I struggled a bit, so it was okay.

Q. How was your swing today and how did you hit your driver?
MICHELLE WIE: It was a lot better than yesterday, but sometimes it hooked a little, but most of them were straight today.

Q. Was it the time difference and the weather and everything that made you so tired?
MICHELLE WIE: I guess, because teeing off at 6:20 on the first day was kind of tough, then you have to come back 7:30 to finish your round, so the first one actually felt like my practice round, so I feel like I played two rounds, really.

Q. Did you get some confidence from this week?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, because I know that you noticed I struggled a bit, and I know better because, like, when I was 10, 11, 12, when I struggled with my driver or my wood, my game would just collapse, so I'm good at covering myself up, doing better on the greens, and reading my greens better, so this tournament gained a lot of confidence in me and I think I'll do better.

Q. How did your playing partners treat you today?
MICHELLE WIE: Tracy and Yu Ping were really nice.  The caddies are really nice to me, too.  My dad was a little slow, the caddies cleaned my ball for me, so it was fun.  They treated me like just an LPGA player, not as a 13-year old, so it was really nice being at the same level as them.

Q. I was telling these guys earlier that you were the first amateur that ever made the cut at this tournament, since 1992.  How does that make feel?
MICHELLE WIE: Good.  I didn't know that, but I wish I played a little bit better than I did because I knew I could play better, but I'm happy with the score and happy that I made the cut.

Q. What are your impressions of this golf course?
MICHELLE WIE: This course is really, like, nice, it's really beautiful, the trees are so green.  The greens are really nice, but they rained a lot so it was a little slower, and overall it's a really nice course.

Q. Is there any part of you that wants to get out on Tour quicker since you've had success this year?
MICHELLE WIE: I don't know.  I think six times is okay for me now.  I guess I may get sick of it if I play too long every week out here.  I think this is the good enough time for me and I think six times a year is good enough.

Q. What other sports do you like to play?
MICHELLE WIE: I like to play volleyball.

Q. Are you on the volleyball team at school?
MICHELLE WIE: They say that if you're 5'9" or taller then you're called exempt on the team, but it is a fall sport so I have to practice then, yeah, but I'm exempt because I'm tall enough.

Q. When do you head back and when do you have to be back at school?
MICHELLE WIE: Monday night and then I go to school on Tuesday.

Q. What time do you have to be back in school on Tuesday?
MICHELLE WIE: Eight.

Q. You had a lot of Korean fans following you today.  Did that bother you at all?
MICHELLE WIE: No, it was okay because they were cheering for me the loudest and it was pretty funny.

Q. When you made the birdies on 17 and 18, did you feel you were getting some momentum going?
MICHELLE WIE: When my putts were starting to fall in, and my drives were going really straight.  Then I got to number 10, I hit a really good drive but it was a little bit low, it caught the end of the tallest tree and fell down, I was a bit unlucky.  I had a good shot but it went right a little bit.

Q. How long was your putt on number one for par?
MICHELLE WIE: About 15  -- no, 14 feet.

Q. How long were your putts for birdie on the holes you didn't make them coming down the stretch?
MICHELLE WIE: I had about, like, 20 feet, I think about each of them were, like, 20 feet and then 17, it was about there.

Q. Where are we going to see you next on Tour?
MICHELLE WIE: ShopRite in Atlantic City. 

Q. How many more LPGA  tournaments do you have after this one?
MICHELLE WIE: After this tournament, four more.

Q. How does it feel to be compared to Tiger Woods?
MICHELLE WIE: It's really great because he's my idol and he's the top player of golf, and he's a really good player, so it's cool to be, like, compared to him.

Q. What's your first class on Tuesday?
MICHELLE WIE: I have a math test.
