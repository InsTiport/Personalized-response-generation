 Q.   The thumb obviously flaring a little bit.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I mean, I knew coming in.   I had hoped it was a week later, but, you know, I just really wanted to come to France.   I really love this tournament.  
So it was at a point where it was touch and go.   I just wanted so see if I could play.   The doctors just told me, It's all up to you.   It just depends on if it hurts or not.   
But they did tell me if it did hurt to stop right away just because it could get worse.  
So, you know, it was tough.   I was out there and I knew I should have stopped earlier but I was having so much fun out there I wanted to keep playing.   
But it got to the point where it was too painful.   So I just made the smart decision to not play.  
Just really disappointed and really wanted to play.   But, you know, just nothing I can do.   I think I should be good for Asia.   Just think this week was one of or two weeks just too soon.
