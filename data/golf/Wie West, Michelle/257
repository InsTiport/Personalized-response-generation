   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you everyone. Michelle, thank you for coming in and joining us. You had a good day today. You are tied for the lead, and you also had an eagle partway through the round. You're almost tied for the lead, one stroke out. So talk about today.
 MICHELLE WIE: I felt like I, you know, played solidly. It was a fun day out there playing with my playing partners. It was fun group out there today. 
 Um, I felt like a lot more putts could have dropped in, but, you know, keep charging along and see what I can do.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Questions for Michelle.

 Q. You seemed a little bit upset when you came in because of the bogey on the last hole. Does that put a damper on your day a little bit?
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, you know, it was good -- I thought I made the putt, but sometimes putts drop and sometimes they don't. This was an interesting tee shot. I don't think it was more than 100 yards, but it was good from where I was. 

 Q. Can you talk about your first time at this course and how it's setting up for your eye? You said there are putts out there where you can get those back tomorrow. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, you know, it's a fun golf course. It's interesting. It's really nothing like we played all year. You know, it's is fun golf course. Have to put it in the fairway and get on the greens and make the putt, I guess. 

 Q. You said it's not like any you've played all year. How is it different?
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, a lot of mounds and a lot of bunkers. You know, just the same old deal, I guess. 

 Q. The flower over your ear, when did you start doing that? The reason why? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, I mean, I always did it at home. You know, it's like an Hawaiian thing. I don't know. Just started to miss home, so I've been trying to bring some of the islands with me.

 Q. We've been following you on Twitter. How is the statistics going?
 MICHELLE WIE: I didn't do any yesterday. I was going to. Had this big grand plan that I was gonna finish my problems yesterday, but I got a little distracted.
 But it's due tomorrow, so I have to do it today. 

 Q. May be some pretty nasty weather for tomorrow. How is your game normally affected, or is it affected by any rain? And based on the course that you've seen today with these greens, how are you going to get those putts back? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, hopefully the weather will hold off. But, you know, if the weather comes, there are a lot other players that have to play in the same situation. It obviously makes it a lot tougher, but you just gotta keep your head on straight and just keep going. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank for coming in, Michelle.
