 Q.  Feeling better today?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, a lot better.  Yeah, a lot better.   
 Q.  Any residual effects from it?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  I woke up this morning and I about passed out again, but I felt really good coming out on the golf course.  I actually didn't feel good warming up, but the more I walked and I was out in fresh air, I felt better and better.  I think the meds are working, my ear is hurting less, and I feel pretty good, actually.   
 Q.  You said you were going to go to the doctor again.  Were you prescribed something or treated for something?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, he treated it as a sinus infection, inner-ear infection, so going with that.  I guess a couple players here at Indian Wells got the same thing, so I guess it's going around here.   
 Q.  Could you sum up your week?  
MICHELLE WIE: I think it was just a bit unfortunate, just the way I was feeling, but I'm really proud of myself for fighting out there on Friday.  Not feeling my best, but I played as hard as I could.  I gave it 110%, which is all I can ask for out of any tournament.  Proud of myself for shooting under par through the weekend, under par basically from Friday on.  I feel good about my game.  I'm excited to see all the fans here.  This is one of my favorite weeks, and I had a lot of fun.   
 Q.  The next start has to be a favorite one for you, too.  How much are you looking forward to that?  
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, I cannot wait to go home.  I'm so excited.   
 Q.  When will you go home?  
MICHELLE WIE: On Thursday.
