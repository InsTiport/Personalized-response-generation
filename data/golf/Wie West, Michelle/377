RHONDA GLENN:  Ladies and gentlemen, Michelle Wie, you are now exempt into next year's Women's Open, finishing in the top-20, that's good.
MICHELLE WIE:  That's really good.  I didn't play the way I wanted to, but I'm still happy with how I finished, I did a lot better than last year, and I got an exemption for next year.
RHONDA GLENN:  You didn't have any double bogeys.
MICHELLE WIE:  I'm really glad about that.  It could have been double bogeys today, but I made it up.  I didn't make any doubles, so I'm really happy.
Q.  How bad did you want low amateur, and did you think about it coming up 17 or 18?
MICHELLE WIE:  I wasn't thinking about low amateur, I was thinking about the trophy.  And it was kind of impossible after a while, but I felt like I just wanted to finish in the red numbers, which I couldn't do.  But I was really trying to go under par.  But it all didn't work out.  I didn't make a lot of birdies today.  I only made one, and that's usually kind of iffy for me.
Q.  You said earlier this week that you learned a lot last year in the U.S. Open.  What did you learn this year?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I learned how to hit more fairways.  You can't hit stock shots all the time.  You have to learn how to move the ball around, sometimes you have to hit it low, sometimes hit it high.  I learned to move my shots off the tee shots, my driver.

On a U.S. Open type course, you never know what's going to happen.  I'll try to be bogey-free for the next couple of tournaments, and see what happens.
Q.  You said it was a major goal to answer critics who said you didn't deserve a special exemption.
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think it's really great for me, it's a lot easier, there's no more really controversy, because they know I earned it.
Q.  I think you answered that question.
MICHELLE WIE:  I could have shot better, but it's good enough.
Q.  (Inaudible).
MICHELLE WIE:  It's really cool, I mean the whole -- kind of the purpose of USGA is to get more people into golf.  And I think that it's really great, those young people following, and they're awesome, and you hope they can play golf and have fun.
Q.  What you remember most about this week?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know.  I think that just everything.  The players, the course, just everything.

I'm going to remember the highs, I'm going to remember the lows, I'm going to remember all the memories that I have.
Q.  With being so young and talented, do you see potential for a rivalry between you and Paula?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I mean, sure enough there is going to be some kind of rivalry sometime, sooner or later, but we're really good friends, so right now we're just having fun and we're just playing golf.
Q.  Have you guys talked about everybody asking you guys about it, is that something you can laugh about together, because it's been such a topic of conversation?
MICHELLE WIE:  We haven't talked about it yet, I don't think we sense it enough to talk about it.  I think we're just trying to play the best.
Q.  You said you came here thinking about the trophy, when did you start realizing it wasn't going to happen for you?
MICHELLE WIE:  When someone was shooting 10-under and I was shooting 1-under, it disappeared.
Q.  What do you think about what Meg is doing?
MICHELLE WIE:  It's awesome.  What did I say yesterday, if someone shoots 65 and wins, I'm happy with that.  But it's awesome.  I hope she wins.
