Q. How did it feel today?
MICHELLE WIE: Not great, you know, but, at the same time, you know, even on the worse day it's still great being out here.  You know, just -- I still had fun today, just stuff is hard.  Hazeltine is hard.
So, you know, I just was overly optimistic about how I could play this week and the status of my wrist.  So, just going to go and got to figure things out a little bit.  But, you know, it's a great week.  The PGA did a great job of introducing us to really a great golf course.  Still got to say I played Hazeltine.  It was hard.
Q. Did you ever think might not play?
MICHELLE WIE: For sure, yeah.  Hitting balls on the range didn't feel great but I wanted to finish and I came here to play so I'm glad these two rounds are over.  They were very long.
Q. Is the most on impact?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.
Q. Is there a part of you that wanted to finish for pride, finish these two days that you fought through?
MICHELLE WIE: Not really -- I guess not really for pride but just, you know, you know, withdrawing to me, I don't like doing it and I didn't feel like a point where -- I still felt like I could play.  I was still going to play.
Q. What's next for you in an ideal world?
MICHELLE WIE: In an ideal world I would wake up and my wrist is fine, I play next week and everything would be perfect.  It's hard because in my mind like I am very optimistic person and when I go back and I just don't hold the golf club and things feel okay I'm okay, I'm ready to try again.
You know, I guess that's a fault of mine but I'm still going to be optimistic about everything.  But definitely try to listen to my body as I don't do a great job of that.  So, it's going to go back and try to figure out what's going to happen.
