  Q. Everything feeling good with the wrist?
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Yeah, I mean, knock on wood.  I do a lot of PT and stuff afterwards.  Yeah.  There was a first aid cart I felt like following us the first and second round, so glad I didn't have to use them.
 Q. That's good to hear that everything is feeling good.  And then just getting into the swing of things, how did it feel to compete again?
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   I mean, rusty and yesterday's conditions, I mean, that was tough to get back into it.  But a lot to learn from the last couple days.  I like today was a lot more consistent than yesterday.
 Obviously still not where I want it to be, but a lot of progress, and that's the best thing.  If I can improve by seven strokes every single day, I'll take it.
 Q. Yeah, that's great.  That he means we have a nice weekend coming up.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Exactly.
