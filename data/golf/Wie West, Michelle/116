 Q.   So feeling good, birdie on 18 had to feel good.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, it felt really good.   I missed a short one for birdie on 15.   Missed a couple of birdie chances coming in.   It always feels good when the ball kind of circles the hole 360 and ends up going in.   It was a fun round today.  
   
 Q.   Was that a big relief?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, just kind of like 4‑under for a long time and then wanted to go 5‑under, missed a couple opportunities.   So, yeah, it's great to shoot 67 in the first round and see what I can do coming in.   
   
 Q.   Any highlights on the other birdies?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Not really.   I had a couple good par saves today, quite handy dandy.   
   
 Q.   Anything on the course?   Conditions were pretty easy.   Rained a little bit?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Definitely this course plays easier when there's not much wind.   I think that definitely makes a huge difference.   
   
 Q.   You said you've been working on the short game and the touch.   Greens were a little soft.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, it was fun, because I feel like the ball kind of sits up with this type of grass and I felt like I was hitting flop shots all day.   It was kind of fun.   I was just blasting them away.   
Definitely you have to hit to the right parts.  
   
 Q.   Terrific three‑ball playing with Shanshan and Lydia Ko.   
MICHELLE WIE:   It was great.   A lot of fun today.  
   
 Q.   Off to practice this afternoon?   It's hot out there.   
MICHELLE WIE:   No, I'm done.   I'm going back to the A/C.
