  Q. What do you make of your performance?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Everything just feels really good. I'm just not scoring. I just need to go out there and do something with my game and try to make more birdies.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the putt on the 17th, how far was it?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I basically just realized I may be just need to be off the green to make stuff. You know, it was a pretty tricky putt, but I just went with it and thankfully it went in.  
  
  Q. How long was it do you think?  
 MICHELLE WIE: I would say about 35 feet.  
  
  Q. Now that you're done with golf, any plans for rest of the day? Do you think you might be going to a concert?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm going to stay inside, maybe shot a little bit, and get ready for the Backstreet Boys tonight, pretty excited.   
  
  Q. Will you be back here next year?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, hopefully, I would love to.   
  
  Q. What's your overall impressions of Singapore, first time at this event?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It's hot. But you know, it was a really well-run event. It's a first-class event. It really does feel like one of the top events. HSBC has done a fantastic job. I mean, I think you can see from the leaderboard, I think it's been great.   
  
  Q. Any standout experiences that you'll take away from here?  
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't think I sweated so much in my entire life over these past two weeks, but it's been fun. It's been really -- I've never been to Singapore before, but definitely it's been a really fun trip.
