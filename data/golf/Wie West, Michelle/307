  Q.  How long was your birdie putt on 18?   
MICHELLE WIE:  About a nine-foot putt.   
    
  Q. Thoughts on the day?   
MICHELLE WIE:  Obviously I'm really disappointed.  I hit some great drives today.  My driving was fantastic.  I just couldn't convert with my irons and putting.  It just all came down to that.  I didn't perform today, but I have to take the positives from that.  I hit my driver really awesome today.    
    
  Q.  Did you have any birdie chances on the greens?   
MICHELLE WIE:  I left myself in really tough positions and got some really unfortunate breaks in the fairway.  I must have been in at least eight divots, but no excuses.  I didn't hit my irons well today at all.  With the wind blowing the ball just went with the wind.  So unfortunately it was very unfortunate there, but I felt like my driving was very solid today.    
    
  Q.  Did it give you confidence to drive the ball well today?   
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, definitely.  The whole year I've been struggling with my driver and I just never got in the fairway.  Today I felt like my driver was really solid.  Every time I stood up to it I felt really confident so that is definitely a positive.  Obviously my irons weren't good so I just have to keep it together.  It's like a puzzle.  I'm just getting one bit at a time.   
    
  Q.  How was your wrist today?   
MICHELLE WIE:  It was better.  Obviously today it hurt on a couple of shots.  Hitting out of divots is not the greatest, but it's better.  It is definitely not hurting as much and that is definitely a positive.   
    
  Q.  So you must be disappointed to miss the cut at an event like this that you have looked forward to for such a long time?   
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, it is a disappointment because I didn't play as well as I wanted to.  But, you know, just playing two rounds here is an amazing feat because it's two more than I've ever played here.  Obviously I really, really enjoyed being here.  I'm really disappointed in how I played, but like I said, I'm really glad that my driver was really working for me today.  I really feel like I got the feel of my driver and I'm just going to work on bouncing back.   
    
  Q.  That was probably the weak link in the first round?   
MICHELLE WIE:  It was definitely.  This whole year my driver was the reason why I've played so bad because I couldn't hit the darn fairway, but today I was really confident on every single drive.  I just have to fit the puzzle together.    
    
  Q.  Do you feel like you are gaining your strength back?   
MICHELLE WIE:  I do.  I do feel a lot stronger.  I'm hitting a lot of shots that I've never really hit before so that is a positive.  I just need to take the positives and go on from there.  I'm starting to feel really good about it, but obviously today was not my day, but I'll do better.
