   MATT PAULSON: (No microphone.)  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I think I did pretty well. I felt like I hit the ball pretty good. I want to be a little closer tomorrow. It's hard putting in the afternoon, especially with the -- a couple of these putts go in ten different directions.   
 But I think there is improvement to be done for tomorrow, but hopefully I can shoot a low score.   
  
  Q. You had it going well, Michelle, and then you ran into a couple of holes coming in. Can you describe 13 and 14?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I think it's the greens, you know. I felt like I hit good putts and they didn't go in.   
  
  Q. How long were the putts?   
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I missed about a 4-footer or 5-footer on 13 and a 9-footer, maybe 12-footer on the next hole.   
 But like I said, you know, I hit good shots, I hit good putts and it didn't work out. But I think I have a lot of positive thoughts from today and looking forward to tomorrow, hopefully I can get it going in the morning.   
  
  Q. What do you think of the 6-under today given the conditions? Pretty good score?   
 MICHELLE WIE: For sure, I think 6-under is a good score. I hope I can shoot close to that tomorrow.   
 MATT PAULSON: Thank you.
