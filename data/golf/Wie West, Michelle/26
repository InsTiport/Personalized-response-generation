 Q.  A little bit of momentum when you made the turn.  What was the change when you got to 10?  
MICHELLE WIE: Actually, I got an iced coffee, so that was kind of the perk I needed.   
 Q.  Take us through your round.  Today was a much different day than yesterday.  The gusts kind of died.  Take us through your round.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just very unlucky the first round -- I mean the first nine.  Felt like I hit good shots, but was just in the rough a lot.  It was pretty unpredictable with the flyers.  Everything that I thought, it just went opposite.   
But I felt like I played well.  Just one of those days where you just get unlucky bounces, unlucky lies.  But it felt pretty good.   
 Q.  And it must feel pretty good too, to golf into the Friday now.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.   
 Q.  How does that feel?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  It feels great to always make it to the weekend, and hopefully the next two days I make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  What needs to change tomorrow?  
MICHELLE WIE: I think just overall a little bit of everything.  Just need to be a little better.   
 Q.  Good luck to you.  
MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.
