DANA GROSS RHODE:  Thank you everyone for stopping in.  We have Michelle Wie, defeated Christina Kim.  Christina alluded to the fact that you are friends, what was it like out there today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, obviously we're pretty close and it's tough to put that out of your mind.  You just have to think that she's just another opponent and, you know, try your hardest.  She played her hardest, I played my hardest.  I just felt like I played really solid today.
Q.  What was it like playing with her, she seems so different from you out on the course, she's so chatty and you're not, what was that like playing with somebody so different today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, in stroke play, it's a lot different than match play obviously when you're playing with someone.  You know, Christina, she's a great player.  I really enjoyed going against her, because, you know, she made putts when she had to.  She succeeded when she had to.  I really respect her as a player and as a person.  I really enjoyed playing against her.  You know, we're two different people.  She's, you know what she is and I am what I am, and we just play a little bit differently.
Q.  Just talk about how you're looking forward to your match with Se Ri, and have you played with her before?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, I haven't.  I really respect her.  You know, when she came out, first on Tour, when she won those majors, you know, she was really someone that I looked up to.  I'm really looking forward to playing with her tomorrow.

Q.  Do you remember when she won, what, eight years ago?  Would you say she was one of your idols?
MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely, she was definitely one of the top players and I really respected her for playing so well as soon as she came out.  You know, I think it's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow.

Q.  Just wondering how you found the crowds today and do you find them any different from when you're watching in a stroke play event?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, the crowd was very supportive today.  I don't know, I didn't really sense any difference really.
Q.  What do you think was the turning point in this match for you?  I think it was all square after 10 and you went 2 up on 11 and 12, and I think it was 14, you had the putt right in front of hers.  Was it any one of those particular moments?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, the second hole and the third hole obviously went my way.  Then she started playing really well and she charged.

I don't really think there was a real momentum.  I played really well today.  She played really well today so it kind of went back and forth.  I felt like I just played solid all day long today.
Q.  You played wonderful today.  How do you think, what's your strength of your golf game?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I'm not really sure right now.  I feel like I'm playing very solidly.  Obviously tomorrow is a whole nother day and you never know what might happen when you wake up tomorrow morning.  I feel like I'm playing really solid.  My driver feels good, my putting feels good.

So I'll work on it a little bit today and hopefully I'll be good for tomorrow.

Q.  Could you talk about playing, you've played four tournaments I think in the last five weeks, is this as tournament tough as you've been, to be able to play consistently a few weeks rather than not playing a tournament for like six weeks and then showing up at a tournament?
MICHELLE WIE:  I like this a lot better.  It's a lot harder to play one tournament, have more than a month off and then play in another.  This way, I feel like, you know, I have a little bit more momentum and I really enjoy it.

.  You know, I really look forward to the summer where I have a lot of tournaments where I can play almost every week and obviously, it's a little harder now, so it's going to be    I have to like take care of my health and my stamina.  You know, I feel really good.
Q.  Along the same lines of that question, you might have to play four rounds over the next two days if you're going to win this thing.  Is stamina an issue at all for players to win this thing and play six rounds over four days?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I'm not thinking about it.  All I'm thinking about is tomorrow morning's round    I'm thinking about every single shot.  I'm not thinking about, oh, it might be tiring to play four rounds in two days.  I can't do that.  I just have to think about tomorrow's round.

Q.  How is the course playing now, is it drying out a bit out there?
MICHELLE WIE:  I feel like it's drying out a little bit.  You know, the heat is definitely drying it up.  You know, maybe it will start to roll a little bit tomorrow, but still, it wasn't really releasing much today.
