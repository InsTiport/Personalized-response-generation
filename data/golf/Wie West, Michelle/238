  Q. Didn't get the most out of that round, huh?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. Well, I tried. I think that, you know, I feel like the Back 9 from 6, I really felt like I knew what I was doing and my head was in the right place.  
 I just kind of wish coming off 9 that that was my first nine and that I would have nine more. But you know, tomorrow -- I feel like I'm getting better and better, and hopefully tomorrow I'll hit more fairways.  
  
  Q. Considering the way you hit it, are you satisfied with the score?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I think I had some good lie putts out there today. You know, it's weird. It was like a lot of pars.   
 You know, tomorrow, I think that I'm doing a good job of parring good holes, and I just gotta take advantage of the shorter holes a little bit more and hit more fairways.  
  
  Q. Do you think you might be a little bit more aggressive on the weekend?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I think so. I think I will. I think I just gotta make more putts.  
  
  Q. What happened at 17?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It was a short one. It was stupid. I pushed it.  
  
  Q. It was a nice shot in there, though.   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it was.  
  
  Q. How long were the birdie putts you made today?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, one was about 15 feet and one was about like 25 feet.  
  
  Q. Was that at No. 8?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Uh-huh.   
  
  Q. Your scrambling skills are pretty good. That's an important part of fighting through days; right?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. I definitely think it's been a struggle. I've been fighting a lot.   
 But also I feel like I'm at a good place. I feel like I'm not far off. Obviously I'd want to be a lot lower at this point, but there's two more days to go, 36 more holes, and hopefully during that 36 holes I can make a lot more birdies.   
  
  Q. Thanks, Michelle.   
 MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.
