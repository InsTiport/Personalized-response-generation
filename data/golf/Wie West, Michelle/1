  Q. Michelle, just your general thoughts.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Wasn't a good day.  You know, got a little mucky from the first hole.  Was right up against a tree.  So it was like a foot from being good on a lot holes but, you know, just didn't (indiscernible - wind) the beginning, but I feel like I've had some really good moments and some really bad moments.
 So definitely a lot of positives to take from and definitely have my work cut out for me.
 Q. Little margin for error out here.  (Indiscernible - wind) gets going the wrong way, I guess.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Yeah, making the right decision takes practice, too.  That's something that is hard to practice when you aren't playing, and that's probably where the rust really showed.  That being said, I had some really good up and downs today that I'm definitely proud of.
 Q. No. 9.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Yeah.  I mean, there were a lot of them.  Again, there was a lot that I didn't save.
 So definitely disappointing, but still a lot to take -- a lot of positives to take from.
