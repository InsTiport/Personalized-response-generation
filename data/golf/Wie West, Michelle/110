Q.   18 birdies.   That had to feel good, but you played very, very well.   Overall thoughts?
MICHELLE WIE:   I hung in there today.   It was one of those days where I hit a couple of loose shots, and just things didn't feel as comfortable as they did yesterday, but it was one of those rounds where I just kept it together, had some good par putts, and yeah, just one of those things where I just kind of‑‑ I hung in there, felt good coming in, so hopefully tomorrow feel a lot more comfortable and make some more birdies.

Q.   Give me the background on the delay.   Do anything special?   Just probably ate and sat a lot?
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   Ate, sat.   Getting stiff, so I tried to roll, see the physio, just trying to keep loose, went to the gym a couple of times, but yeah, mostly just being patient and trying not to get frustrated.   There's really nothing anyone can do.   It's pretty amazing how great the golf course drained. 
I mean Cristie, we were like sitting on the ground today like while we were waiting and it was absolutely dry.   It was so try, and it's crazy.   It's pretty phenomenal what they did with the bunkers and how they got the course ready in that short of time.   I think any other course if we got that much rain we'd be done for the week.   So it's pretty phenomenal.

Q.   Did the mindset change now that it's 54, a little bit more of urgency or did you just stick to the plan that it was third round?
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   I was in a good position.   I think if I was a couple more shots back, I would have felt more urgent, but definitely one more round.   I'm definitely a couple shots back.   I just need to make it up tomorrow.

Q.   A lot more flop shots I saw out there.   How did the work around the greens feel?
MICHELLE WIE:   Flop shots for days.

Q.   All day.   How did the short game feel?
MICHELLE WIE:   Pretty good, yeah.
