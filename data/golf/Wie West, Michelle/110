 Q.   I know not the finish you hoped for going into the day, but pretty solid week overall, and part of a great season.   How do you recap it?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, obviously I wanted to win this thing coming into today.   But I played as hard as I could today.   Obviously my irons were just a little shaky on the front nine, but I really hung in there.   It was tough today.  
I'm really proud of myself and appreciative of everything that's happened this.   So many great things have happened.   I really can't complain.   I'm so grateful.   I'm really looking forward to 2015.  
   
 Q.   When you look back on 2014, how will you remember that in your career?  
MICHELLE WIE:   A lot of great memories.   I think just a lot of the great things have happened.   I think my injury would not even be an afterthought after this year.  
I just feel really good and I want to keep building on this year, just keep building momentum, and hopefully do the same or better next year.  
   
 Q.   Closing with that birdie looks like you're going to get into third place in the Race to CME Globe.   What does that mean to you?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I worked really hard all year to try and get to No. 1; I was really close.   That kind of gets me going for next year.   Something to look forward to.   Really motivates me.  
Right now all I can think about is what I'm going to do with my time off.  
   
 Q.   We'll end said on that:   What's the plans for Michelle Wie during the offâ€‘season?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Absolutely no golf.
