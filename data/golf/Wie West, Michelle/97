  MODERATOR:   Happy to be joined in the media center by Michelle Wie after 3‑under round today. 
Michelle, what were the keys? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I started off really hot.   A little bit disappointed that I couldn't keep that going on the back nine.   Had a couple bad breaks.
Just feel solid, same as yesterday.   Try to be patient in the wind.   It was pretty gusty today.   Sometimes it wouldn't blow at all and sometimes it would blow. 
Just try to stay patient all day and try to give myself good opportunities.
MODERATOR:   You had the hole‑out.   What did you hit into that?   Were you able to see it go in the hole?   How did it help to get your round going? 
MICHELLE WIE:   I had about like 117 yards, a little gap wedge.   I kind of saw it roll over the hill and I was like, Oh, okay.   It's disappearing. 
Then everyone went crazy.   It was pretty fun.
MODERATOR:   Questions for Michelle. 

Q.   How do you feel you're playing over the first two rounds versus this time last year?
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, it's hard to compare.   I don't really try to compare from last year.   Right now I feel like I'm playing patiently, and I just need to try to make more birdies on the weekend. 

Q.   You know what a championship round feels like.   You're heading into the last 36 holes.   Do you feel like you've out yourself in that position? 
MICHELLE WIE:   It's exciting, yeah.   You know, I definitely feel like I have a good chance.   You know, I'm close, so I just need to go out there on the weekend and try to make something happen. 

Q.   I know you don't like to look back here, but if you could take one or two shots back today, where would they be?
MICHELLE WIE:   2 tee shot would be just really it.   Just lost a little momentum there.   I gave myself a lot of good birdie opportunities.   Just didn't go in. 

Q.   How many putts inside ten feet have you had this week?
MICHELLE WIE:   Quite a bit I think.

Q.   Is that frustrating, that you haven't been able to get more of those in?
MICHELLE WIE:   No.   I mean, these greens are tricky.   I feel like I'm doing everything I can to try to make the putts.   I'm hitting good putts, good speed, and there is really nothing you can do when the wind blows it offline or the grain takes it.
It gets tricky.   I try make the best decisions.   I made a lot today; yesterday as well too.   I just got to keep giving myself these opportunities and then just try to make the most advantage of it. 

Q.   How would you sum up the experience of playing with a group that you guys have all won this event before?   Just the camaraderie I guess of playing with them. 
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, I don't think none of us really noticed it over the past couple of days.   I mean, 
  I've played with them a lot in past tournaments.   They're really fun to play with and it was a blast.   We were laughing all day. 
MODERATOR:   Anything else for Michelle?   Appreciate the time.   Good playing.
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.
