Q.   Any disappointment?
MICHELLE WIE:   A little bit.   I definitely really wanted to.   At the same time, I tried really hard.   Just was a little bit close; just wasn't there.

Q.   So your best finish of the year.   Positive takeaways from that? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, a lot of positive takeaways.   I had so much fun this week.   My game is really starting to feel good.   It was just fun this week. 
So I am going to just get that momentum going for the next couple of weeks and the rest of the season.

Q.   We knew you would have a crowd out here, but you walk around and you have the biggest crowd by far.   How does that feel as a competitor?
MICHELLE WIE:   It feels great.   I mean, so many of my friends came today as well too.   It's fun.   It's fun seeing everyone out here.

Q.   How were you feeling going into this tournament?
MICHELLE WIE:   I felt pretty good.   It's still a battle.   I don't feel quite 100% yet, which is ridiculous because I got sick back in February.   I feel like I should be better by now. 
But it feels great to be back home and breathing the nice Hawaiian air.

Q.   How has your time in Hawaii been so far? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Feels good.   It's been so much fun.   I spent all last week just hiking, paddle boarding, being home and eating all the good stuff. 
I'm not quite ready to leave yet.   They're going to have to drag me onto the plane tomorrow.

Q.   What are some of the highlights of this week?
MICHELLE WIE:   I think just coming home and playing in front of my friends and family.   Just getting to come back home.   That's always highlight of my year.
