   MICHELLE WIE: I mean, to see three-foot putts, four-foot putts going in, it's substantial. It gives me confidence that I can really tear it up the next couple days. I'll head straight for the putting green, but other than that, the long putts felt good and my speed felt good, and I didn't feel like I was pulling or pushing. I feel like tomorrow keep doing the things that I'm doing good and make a lot more putts, and I feel like I can shoot a lot lower.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it was like that the whole day. I hit some pretty good iron shots out there. It's just like I said, a couple shots, just really should have had a lot more going, but it's still the first round. There's three more rounds to go, and tomorrow I feel like I can go low.   
  
  Q. The conditions were pretty good today?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, the conditions were very good. They've kept the golf course in great condition. The fairways were good. The golf course is really well run. A couple tricky pins today, but a great day, though.
