Q. Tough day-out there.
MICHELLE WIE: It was kind of a little foolish to think that I would shoot really well, just hitting golf balls last week, at Hazeltine.  It's a tough golf course but I'm really, really happy that I play.  Just feeling a lot of joy just being out there, and, you know, competing again.  It's going to take time and I've just got to be patient and thankfully I have all afternoon to get warm again and take care of my wrist.
Q. How do you balance the joy of playing with prudence of not making it worse?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's hard.  It's just one of those situations where I'm not, you know, I'm not entirely sure how much more I have left in me so even on the bad day I'm just like trying to take time to enjoy it.  But it's tough.
