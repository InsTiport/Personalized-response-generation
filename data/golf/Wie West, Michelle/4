  Q. Michelle, I know this wasn't quite the score that you would have liked today.  In your words, tell us some of the good and some of the bad that you can take away from your first round back after 21 months away.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   I birdied the 1st hole, so that was good.  I hit a lot of great shots today.  Just felt like I had a couple unlucky bounces here and there that could have made a big difference.
 At the same time, just couldn't get my putter going.  Just didn't make a lot confident strokes out there today which I know I can improve for tomorrow.  But then again, I hit a lot of great shots.  It was tough to conditions to kind of come back to, but no excuses.  I'm really taking a lot of the positives out it, and there were a lot.  Didn't seem like it, but I'm excited, I'm grateful to be back out here, grateful that I have another day tomorrow to kind of get my game ready for ANA.
 I hope I make a lot of birdies tomorrow.
 Q. Is Michelle Wie the mother different playing golf to Michelle Wie before you had Makenna?
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   100%.  I mean, I would be spending an hour on this putting green, but I got to head back and do bath time now.
 So definitely priorities are there, are different, and that's just kind of -- I mean, I had a big smile on my face all day today because life is good.  I'm out here playing again; I have a beautiful daughter.
 Life is great.
 Q. It's great to see you back.  Congratulations on making it back, and what a wonderful family you have.
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Thank you.
 Q. How do you know your caddie?
 MICHELLE WIE WEST:   Oh, we're just good friends from Jupiter.
