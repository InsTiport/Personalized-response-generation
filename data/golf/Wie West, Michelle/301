   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Overall, you know, it was a 1-over par, so it was a little bit higher than yesterday.  How are you feeling about your game right now?   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I definitely feel like I played more solidly than I did yesterday.  Obviously the score was a little bit higher, but I felt like my long game is a lot more solid than yesterday.   
 I was hitting a lot more good shots, a lot more solid.  I feel like it's getting better and better.  Obviously yesterday my putter was really hot, so that's why I dropped a lot of putts.  Today I also dropped a lot of long ones early on.  It feels more and more solid.  I'm a little bit rusty from tournament mode, but I feel like I have two really solid rounds under my belt.  Tomorrow hopefully will be good.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Questions for Michelle.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I hit it left.  I was right at the curve actually.  My ball was in the grass area but like about a centimeter behind it.  I was thinking, oh, at least if I hit it fat it won't go heavy.  I was just kind of scared for my wrist a little bit there.   
 But I just kind of hit a couple shots.  Just went up there, and I think it was seriously one of the best shots that I hit today.  I had a 7-iron and I was on the path, so like the ball was a lot higher than my feet.   
 I just felt like I was really confident with that shot.  I just really trusted myself.  I hit it clean.  It was not an easy shot.  Half of my club was lying on the curve and half of it was lying on the rough.   
 Just a really interesting shot.  I never had it before, and I hope I never do again.  I felt like ti was one of the most solid shots I hit today.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I know, I did.  It felt really good.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I think any kind of putt that I made today, especially on 5 when I made that really long one, on two, any kind of shot like that I nfeel like it pumps me up and gives me momentum.  I felt like that was what I was lacking on the back 9.   
 That little one turn where I can get hot down the streak.  That's where I was saying I'm a little bit rusty from tournament golf.  I felt like with the two really solid rounds under my belt I think I'm just getting better and better.   
 Good shots are going into the memory bank, and it's just going to get better.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  That's what everyone hopes to have.  You know, a really good long game.  Really good short game and really good putting.  Hopefully I can bring it all together.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely.  And, you know, it's still very early on.  It's my first tournament back, and, you know, obviously I'm very happy with how it turned out.  I mean, how I got here.  How I played really solid today and had a lot of really good tee shots.   
 I feel like my distance is coming back.  I had a lot of really good solid shots.  Had a couple bad breaks on a couple of lies throughout the round.  That's what golf is.   
 I didn't feel like the score showed how well I played today.  It's very early on, and I'm just coming back.  Like I said, I'm still a little bit rusty, but two solid rounds under my belt and I'm really feeling better.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  You know, I tell myself I have a choice of either sulking about it or thinking about a situation, or I can make a little game out of it and pull myself out.  I felt like today, you know, it was -- just kind of a couple shots, like I said on that curve shot, I just really focused and really just put all my energy into putting a good shot rather than dwelling on, What if something happens?   
 So I feel like I accomplished my goal of staying in the present.  If a couple shots didn;t go the way I wanted to, it's fine.  It's still really early on.  I hit a lot more good shots than I did bad.  I think I'm definitely on the positive road back.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  I think that's what makes the round.  You know, where you hole a long, impossible par putt and you make a birdie putt.  Those are the putts that makes or break you.   
 So I feel like whether it's for par or birdie or eagle, whatever, you know, a putt is a putt and a shot is a shot.  I feel like I just really hit a -- I played a solid round today.  The score did not show how well I played.   
 After I putted out on 18 I was like, I can't believe that the score shows what it did, because I felt like I played a lot better.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  It felt like old times when I made that putt.  It was like, yeah.  Kind of felt really good actually.  It was about -- I don't know, felt like 45 feet, I think.  But it was like kind of like that ridge shot.  Yeah, exactly.   
 I go out there like, Oh, God, this is fast.  So maybe one of those shots that I thought positively and I just focused and I just was really confident with it.   
 I was putting good, and I just told myself just putt it and it went in.  It was a really good feeling.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.).   
 MICHELLE WIE:  You know, I've been practicing a lot and I think it's showing.  Like I said, it's just everything is coming back together:  The long game, the short game, the putting.  I feel like it's just all coming back.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely to shoot a lower round than today.  Hopefully the score will show how well I'm playing.  It was really solid.  Another solid round under my belt.   
 I just need right now positive thoughts and positive rounds.  Just to put into my memory bank and to move on forward from that.  I feel like I just need to,  you know, just stay present, be positive with myself.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I just felt like I played a little (indiscernible), you know, camouflage the fairways. No, it's like the new color for Nike for the season, and I thought I'd wear it.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all very much.  Good luck tomorrow, Michelle.
