 Q.   Finished out.   A little frustrating, but you closed out pretty strong, I thought.  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   Just on the back nine I had a lot of good iron shots.   Just got really unlucky with the bounces and whatnot.  
Overall I fought hard, and I'm pretty proud of the way I played this week and I think it's a good week leading up to a major, so I'm just excited to get over there and play well.  
   
 Q.   Going into next week obviously you'll have a little bit of momentum but it's almost like a major in terms of condition wise, it's almost like British Open conditions.   Mentally do you think that's preparing you to play well?  
MICHELLE WIE:   For sure.   Almost glad it was a threeâ€‘day event.   It was hard out there.   It was really mentally and physically challenging playing in the wind.   It was getting quite strong at some times, but it's a great tournament and great finishing hole with the grand stands.   So I had a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Yeah.   Talk about walking up to here.   Obviously the announcer got everyone a little rowdy.   Talk about just the New Jersey crowd and everybody embracing the tour when they stop here?  
MICHELLE WIE:   The crowd is great here.   Everyone is really energetic.   They love watching us play and we feel just really welcome here.
