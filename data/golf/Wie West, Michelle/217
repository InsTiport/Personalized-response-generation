  Q. Can you give us some general thoughts on your round? Couple of birdies, couple of bogeys, steady round, right?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Kind of up and down a little bit, but not too bad. It was kind of a day where I felt like I shot a lot better than I scored.  
  
  Q. If you could do one thing better tomorrow, what would it be?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know. I think just a little improvement here and there. I think nothing's really that bad right now. I think I played a lot better than yesterday. But got to be on the fairways and the right part of the green, just got to make putts. Everything, I guess.  
  
  Q. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at the leaderboard, but last I looked you're tied for 10th. But you have a lot of strokes to make up if you want to win this tournament. What are your thoughts about where you stand on the leaderboard?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I've really got to shoot lights out. I've got to make a lot of birdies tomorrow and make no mistakes. So hopefully I can do that.  
  
  Q. It seems like you get close into a good rhythm and then something happens. How does it feel to you, same thing?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, a few mistakes here and there, but it's a tough golf course.   
 Going out there I need to get into a rhythm, and hopefully tomorrow I can get on a big birdie run.  
  
  Q. Has every day been different?   
 MICHELLE WIE: A little bit, yeah, every day's always different.  
  
  Q. Because you haven't played for a month or is that just the way it goes?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I think it's the way it goes. It's a tight golf course. It's kind of like golf, you know, some days you play well, some days you don't.  
  
  Q. How about the weather issues and the scheduling? Does that kind of screw with your rhythm or momentum a little bit?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I think I got lucky with the draw this week, so no complaints for me.
