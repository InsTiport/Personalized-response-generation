 Q. So a round of 67 today; you must be pleased with that.
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm just happy to be done. I'm happy I made it through. It's been a little bit of a struggle this week but I was really happy to end on a really good note.

 Q. What was the key today?
 MICHELLE WIE: Things happened a lot better. Just hit a couple of shots closer. Hit two really close ones, so that helped. 

 Q. You had a string of birdies there, I think 9, 10,11, or 10,11, 12, maybe talk about that, that seemed to get you rolling and moved you up the leaderboard. What were you feeling when you started stringing the birdies together?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think on the front nine a couple, just felt good to actually make a couple of birdies.

 Q. Is this your best finish for a while would you say? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I think so.

 Q. So will you take confidence from this going into next season?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I think I take a lot of confidence and just going to go and enjoy my time off a little bit and get back really into it, train hard and practise harder so I can become a way better putter next year. 

 Q. Just looking at the year, maybe you can sum up, because this is your last tournament for the year, you won one tournament early on. How would you characterise the year? Is it a step-by-step process or how do you feel about this year compared to some of the others?
 MICHELLE WIE: I just didn't feel as healthy as I wanted to this year. I feel like I've been struggling with a lot of injuries this year, so one of my main goals for next year is to be healthy and to be strong and to be able to try and show my best ability. 

 Q. Were you in pain today or was it okay? 
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I just kept thinking, 17 holes, 16 more holes; I'm glad that I made it through.
