 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, definitely it's been very disappointing.  It's many reasons disappointing.  I tried my best and that's all I can do.  I came here thinking if something happens, it happens and something did happen so I was going to leave with positive memories. 
 I made a lot of good birdies this week, and it was a lot of fun playing a practise round with David Toms and Joe Durrant and I learned a lot from playing with them and my playing partners over the last two days.  I'm just really looking forward to just taking some time off and getting back into it. 

 Q.  Just your performance today, does that in any way, change the way you approach competing in these men's events? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Not at all.  I think that if I had shot my best round today and I shot this way, then definitely I would reconsider, you know, what I want to do. 
 Today, this week I didn't play well and I'm going to take into account a lot of things happened.  I think that if I get my game going back again, it's going to work.  I have a lot of game in me, it's just not showing now, and I just have to get that coming out and once it comes out, I think it's going to be good. 

 Q.  Have you measured yourself lately? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Me?  No.  Why? 

 Q.  Because you look taller, and I didn't know if you had grown an inch or so. 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know.  My parents think I grew but they always think I grow. 
 I think I have definitely grown this year but I don't really know truth be told.  I don't measure myself with a measuring stick every day.  (Smiling). 

 Q.  What would you attribute the last five months, the scores that you've had, what would be the top three things that have held you back over that period of time? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I definitely think driver, No. 1.  No. 2, I think irons I guess.  I don't know, I'm not really sure. 
 But definitely the one thing that pops into my head is I think I just have to get comfortable with my driver again, because that is my strong point.  I think right now it's just, you know, wavering a little bit.  But I think I have it in me, because when I hit, I feel like when I hit it good, it's really good. 
 So I just have to get that out and I just have to get used to it.  I feel like once I get my ball in the fairway, it's a done deal. 

 Q.  Did you think maybe because of who the title sponsor, maybe you pushed yourself a little bit too hard, maybe pushed yourself into a few mistakes out there, maybe might have felt some of that pressure? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  No, not really, I don't think it's because Sony is sponsoring this tournament.  I don't think that has anything to do with it.  I feel like it's a very special event for me because of that. 
 But there's really no added pressure to it.  I mean, unfortunately, things happened, didn't turn out the way I wanted to but I don't think it was because of added pressure or anything like that. 

 Q.  How is the wrist? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  It's okay.  It's so-so.  I mean, it did hurt a little bit truth be told.  But it is what it is and there's nothing I can do about it. 

 Q.  I just wanted to ask you about Tadd, he might make the cut, it looks like he's in pretty good position.  Just your thoughts on that? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I think it's great.  I've never played with him or talked with him.  It's great being how young he is.  I'm rooting for him.  I think it's going to be great. 

 Q.  Are you going to go to Stanford in the fall? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yes, I am. 

 Q.  For sure? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Not for sure but definitely -- I haven't signed the papers yet but I want to. 

 Q.  Are you going to play the Omega Masters again this year? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I'm not really sure.  I mean, my schedule, I'm not really, really sure about my schedule yet. 

 Q.  What would hold you back from signing your papers to Stanford? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I just all of a sudden don't want to study I guess.  But I don't think that's going to happen because, you know, I'm really looking forward to college life and all of that and I always wanted to experience it. 
 I guess there could be a lot of reasons, but I'm pretty determined to go. 

 Q.  When are you going to make the decision? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I'll let you know when I do make it.  (Laughter). 

 Q.  How do you draw a line between too much time off and enough time to heal and get your game back to where I want it? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I'm not really sure.  I guess we'll have to find out.  This is the first time so I'm not really sure.  I'm really looking forward to it.  I'm looking forward to focusing on school, go out with my friends, take it easy and practise my short game and putting. 
 I think I'll get back into it but I'm really looking forward to a nice rest right now and I'm very eager to get back. 

 Q.  Will you play either of the two Hawaii LPGA events? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I'm not really sure on my schedule right now.  I'm still working on it.  It's just not finalized. 

 Q.  There will be more people now that there jump on the non-Michelle bandwagon in regards to playing at men's events.  What do you say to those people with the limited success you've had here? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I don't really care.  I don't really care if they jump on the bandwagon or not.  It's just what they think and people have opinions.  I guess let them have opinions. 
 But that's not going to change what I want to do, because they don't know me personally and they don't know what I want, and you know, they don't feel what I feel. 
 So I guess let them have an opinion of me, but I won't take that into account, because I know myself better than anyone, and if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it.
