NEAL REID:  All right.  It's been a long day for you, can you talk about how you feel?  It looks like you're going to make the cut as far as where it is right now.  So talk about how you feel going into tomorrow. 
MICHELLE WIE:  I played okay overall, but I made some very silly mistakes out there.  I made some really good putts and it equalled out.  But I feel I should have played better.  But I think I played okay the first round because -- and the second round.  I played 31 holes today.  It was pretty tiring.  I kept thinking of the U.S. Open qualifying.  I played okay the first round and the second round I got tired and I played bad.  But then I got a lot better.  So I'm really proud of myself.  I think I'll play better tomorrow because I'm taking out my driver a lot more.  I'm trying for the greens on the short holes.  I want to play aggressive tomorrow.  So I hope I'll play better tomorrow. 

Q. Is this a long hitter's course?
MICHELLE WIE:  Not as much as Mission Hills.  But you have to be really strategic here.  You have to play a 4-wood when you have to play it.  I guess it's good to be long on any course. 
NEAL REID:  Can you talk about, you said you made some stupid mistakes, were they club selection or course management or what?
MICHELLE WIE:   I think today I kept on picking out the long club.  On the last hole I think I should have hit a 6-iron instead of five.  Those kind of mistakes made me have like a par instead of a chance for birdie.  I 3-putted a couple of times today, but later on my long putts started going in and I started putting better.  It got a lot better.  The putts started falling.  But overall I played good, but it wasn't my day. 

Q. Was the drive on 18 your best drive of the two days?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know, I've been hitting my driver really bad.  And I guess it was just one of those drives. 

Q. What about your drive on six or seven?
MICHELLE WIE:  The one that doglegs there?  I hooked that drive. 

Q. No, on five when you had 92 yards to the green.
MICHELLE WIE:  Oh, that one. 
(Laughter.) That was an okay drive.  That was a good drive.  It didn't hook.  Where the problem was I think my old swing came back again and I couldn't fix it during the round.  It kept on drawing too much. 

Q. How far was your birdie putt on 16?
MICHELLE WIE:  About 27 feet, 30 feet. 

Q. Is this the first time you've flown so far and played so much golf in such a short amount of time?
MICHELLE WIE:  It's a new experience for me.  I never did this before.  I have been doing a lot of things I've never done before.  Like we flew over for 15 hours, arrived the day before, only had one practice round.  So yesterday's round felt like a practice round to me.  I was just figuring out how the course went.  And the greens are pretty wet because it rained a lot.  And I kept thinking it was like Mission Hills and it was really fast.  So all my shots or club selection was short.  But the second round I was getting better.  I was hitting closer to the pin.  So I think I'm progressing. 

Q. Did you say your old swing came back?
MICHELLE WIE:  My old swing came back, yeah. 

Q. Have you ever had to fight snap-hooks?
MICHELLE WIE:  Like 10, 11, a long time ago. 

Q. Did you just draw it too much, or what?
MICHELLE WIE:  Oh, I used to push it out to the right and then hook it back in.  But after going to Gary my swing got a lot better and went straighter.  But today I tried to kill it so it went left. 

Q. How much does your dad help with club selection?
MICHELLE WIE:  He doesn't work with the club selection and stuff.  He just tells me if I'm way wrong other way short other way long.  And then today on my putter I couldn't align myself and I couldn't read the greens.  So he practically read them all for me. 

Q. It seems like everyone that was here at the course today was out watching your group.
MICHELLE WIE:  I guess, yeah. 

Q. (Inaudible.)  
NEAL REID:  What hole was that?
MICHELLE WIE:   One.  Yeah. 

Q. What's your mindset for tomorrow since you'll probably be nine strokes off the lead?
MICHELLE WIE:  I'm just going to be aggressive.  Try to catch up to the leaders as much as I can.  Try to get to the top-10, at least.  Just play a good round tomorrow.  Play a steady, solid round.  Under par. 

Q. What happens to your school work when you're on the road like this?
MICHELLE WIE:  I already finished it on Wednesday. 

Q. So, you're done with it?
MICHELLE WIE:  I did it on the car because I had a lot of car trips that day.  I went to our physical therapist center and then after that we went to my dad's office.  So I finished it all in the car. 

Q. What do you think about your gallery being twice as large as the leader's, Karrie Webb?
MICHELLE WIE:  I feel happy because I guess people are attracted to me playing.  And, I don't know. 

Q. Do you like having a lot of people watch you, or is it distracting?
MICHELLE WIE:  I feel really proud because Mission Hills is a lot bigger and it was a couple of times that the crowds bothered me there.  So I don't really mind them much.  But when they come up and like be really proud of me, then I'm really happy because I know I done good. 

Q. Do you have any ambition to attack the men's Tour like Annika Sorenstam is?
MICHELLE WIE:  Sure, why not. 

NEAL REID:  Anything else for Michelle?  All right.  Thank you very much.
