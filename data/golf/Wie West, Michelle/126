 Q. Barely over the drinking age and she's still drying out in champagne.  Congratulations.  How were you able to handle the pressure out there today?MICHELLE WIE: You know, I just had a lot of fun.  It was just like I said yesterday, I woke up so excited.  I was just so grateful for this opportunity.  And I definitely got a lot of goose bumps walking up 18 because I thought to myself how cool it was.  I kind of had the same putt as Martin.  Didn't quite hit it as hard as he did.  Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.
Q. After what happened to you on the 16th hole?  How big was that birdie putt on 17, and what were you thinking standing over that ball?MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I kind of smiled after I made my double bogey putt.  I like to make it hard if myself.  But 17 I kind of played well there the last couple of days.  But that putt went nicely, right at the end.  But it was awesome.
Q. Through all the highs and lows, through all the ups and downs, did you ever have any doubt you would be standing here as the U.S. Women's Open champion one day?MICHELLE WIE: Obviously there are moments of doubt in there.  But obviously I had so many people surrounding me, my family, my friends, my coaches, Dave Leadbetter, everyone, my agency, IMG, they never lost faith in me, that's what pushed me forward.  It's amazing.
