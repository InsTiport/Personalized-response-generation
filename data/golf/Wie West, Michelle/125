Q. What was the biggest difference today versus yesterday?MICHELLE WIE: The front nine was great.  I just didn't drive it well in a couple of holes on the back nine.  It's hot out there, I think I need to maybe warn up a little less tomorrow, because I felt like I was really tired.  But I made the turn and felt really tired out there.  Felt hot for a while out there, I thought just because I was not hitting the fairways and whatnot.  It felt great out there today.  It's definitely a grind, it's not an easy golf course.  Still 2-over today, I still can't complain.  Obviously there were a couple of shots I wanted back, and I felt I could do better, but at the same time I really grinded out there and I tried my best.  I'm happy with that.
Q. One of the shots that you'd like back be on the 11th hole?MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, probably.  But all the shots really on the back nine.
Q. Just obviously you let a couple get by you, but you're still going out in the last group tomorrow.  A lot of positives you feel going in?MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure, a lot of positives.  I hit a lot of great shots today.  I made a lot of good putts today, too.  I hit every putt perfectly, with perfect speed, just misread a couple on the back nine.  But I'm happy.  And I'm happy that I have a chance.  I'm happy that I'm in contention.  I'm just really grateful for another opportunity to get a Major championship.
Q. Now that Sunday is here, what's your attitude overnight and tomorrow morning and how do you approach that?MICHELLE WIE: I'm going to try to sleep as much as I can.  But, yeah, I'm just going to go out there.  Just going to try as hard as I can.  I think that I'm really grateful that I have another opportunity at this.  I also feel like as an American I just feel very proud that I'm in contention.  And I will play with pride tomorrow.  And I'm going to have fun.  It will be fun with Amy tomorrow.  I played with her the first two days.  I'm going to try my hardest.  And who knows what will happen.  But at the end of the day I'm going to go out there and try my hardest and see what I can do?
Q. It's not often that you fly under the radar, but with Lucy getting so much attention the first two days, it almost seemed like you did the a little bit.  Did you feel that and could you use that to your advantage?MICHELLE WIE: I mean, you know, she's great.  I saw her out there today watching most of 18 holes.  And she's just so cute.  And I watched a couple of holes yesterday on TV watching her play.  She's really talented.  She's got a really bright future ahead of her.  I'm really excited for her that she gets the experience.  I ran into her in the locker room and talked to her little bit.  And I hope she comes out tomorrow and watch.  It's great to see her out there.
Q. You talked about this being America's championship, it's been four years since an American won.  How do you balance with not getting too emotional?MICHELLE WIE: Like I said before, I'm very proud that as an American I have a chance tomorrow and I'm definitely going to play with pride.  But at the same time I can't look forward.  I'm going to focus on every single shot.  Play like I did on the front nine, and duplicate it on the back nine tomorrow.  I'm going to have fun tomorrow and see what happens.
Q. Amy Yang, talk a little bit about her game and what she's so good at.MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, Amy and I, we're pretty good friends and we play with her a lot.  And she's just so consistent.  She barely misses a green, barely misses a fairway, is a great putter.  She's overall a really sound golfer.  I think she took some time off a little bit this year.  I think she's fresh.  I think she really wants it.  So I think tomorrow is going to be a great battle.  I'm just going to go out and just try and play any own game and not focus so much on other players.
