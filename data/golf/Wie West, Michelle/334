 MICHELLE WIE:  It's pretty ridiculous.  I wasn't feeling too good with myself after that tee shot, especially after I dropped my ball.  I was in the worst place ever.  There was a weed behind my ball, and I somehow got it over that water with the pin tucked in front.

I hit a very good shot my second shot, and I just    it was kind of a weird tee shot and then a good second shot, and then that putt was very good.  I felt like I was putting good all day long and made some putts out there.  But after I made that putt, I was like laughing to myself.  It was pretty ridiculous.
Q.  Did you like the approach shot to the green the whole way?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I kind of had to do that.  I kind of had to dig it out of the mud.  I mean, I had no idea    I had some idea about how it was going to come out, but I was just hoping that it wouldn't do anything funny.  But I hit it the way I wanted to, and I was very glad.
Q.  (Inaudible).
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, it hasn't really registered yet that I'm playing 36 holes.  It still feels like Friday.  It'll probably hit me tomorrow after I play 18 holes, God, I have to play 18 more.  It's going to be interesting.  It's never really happened before in a U.S. Open.  I think it's going to be an interesting day tomorrow, and hopefully I'll keep playing solidly throughout 36 holes.
Q.  (Inaudible).
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, it's fine.  It's just been acting up a little bit here and there, but it's been really good.  I've been working it out, strengthening it.  My wrist was a little bit weak, but it feels really good.
Q.  When you finished at Canoe Brook, did you feel more drained mentally or physically?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I didn't feel that tired right after, but there's a lot of emotions, a lot of adrenaline rushing.  The next morning I woke up and I felt like I was 80 years old.
Q.  Is there anything you can do at some point during a round to make sure you don't lose focus?  Do you fight that at times?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I think that the key tomorrow is not going to be to just think about it too much.  I'm just going to play it hole by hole, and hole by hole adds up to 36 holes.  I'm just going to have fun out there, not be too serious about it.  It's 36 holes on the last day of a U.S. Open tournament.  It's going to be interesting.  I'm looking forward to it.
