TODD BUDNICK:  We thank Michelle Wie for stopping in after a 6 over 77 in today's first round of the John Deere Classic.  I know it's not the start you hoped for today.  First couple holes you had a couple balls go right off the tee it seemed today.
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah.  I mean, it was very uncharacteristic of me to do that, but I felt like considering that I had the water hazard penalties, considering that I had to call unplayable, considering that I hit my driver like 50 yards right, I felt like I played really well.  I felt like I made a lot of great up and downs, I felt like I putted great, my irons were good.

You know, on the last couple holes during the back nine, I felt like my driver was working very well.  I feel like I have a lot of confidence going into tomorrow.
TODD BUDNICK:  Looks like you shook off that front nine on the back there.  Tell us what was the change from the front to back?
MICHELLE WIE:  You know, I just changed my posture a little bit and tweaked around a little bit, played around with my shots.  It couldn't get any worse, so I just played around with it.  Luckily it worked, so I'll keep that same mentality going for tomorrow.
Q.  That bug on the second tee kind of seemed to get to you a little bit.
MICHELLE WIE:  I mean, literally I had like five of them on me.  As soon as I got on the ball    I mean, it's okay if the bugs are like around the ball, I can handle that.  But they were crawling on my arm, they were on my hand, they were on my head.  I mean, it was just ridiculous.  I had to step back like five times.  It was just very unfortunate.
Q.  Did that kind of throw you off, your concentration?
MICHELLE WIE:  I would like to say it didn't, but it bothered me a little bit.  Bugs on me, I hate bugs, and I was starting to get a little aggravated like the fifth time I stepped out.  I was a little aggravated, but I felt like I shook it off.  Obviously I didn't hit that tee shot the way I wanted to, but I don't think it was because of the bugs.
Q.  How were you feeling physically today as far as coming into the round?  Were you tired at all and did you have any aches and pains or anything during the round?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, I felt pretty good.  It was very hot out there.  I'm not really used to wearing long pants in the heat, but it was okay.  I mean, obviously there's a lot of hills on this golf course, but I didn't really feel tired.  I was sweating a lot out there, but I felt like I hydrated myself very well when I had to, and I kept my energy level up all around.
Q.  Last year after the first round you were 1 under.  Just talk about how disappointing I guess it is for you to be where you are now compared to where you were at this time last year.
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I didn't make the cut shooting 1 under on the first round, so maybe shooting 6 over might do it (laughter).
Q.  Where you were in the Sony Open after the first round, 79, you came back pretty well.  Can you do that again here tomorrow, and if you do, are you going to the last four or five holes thinking, hey, maybe I can make the cut?
MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely.  I feel like I have a really good round in me.  I feel like if I hit the fairways more, if I was in the fairway I could have shot a lot under par.  I felt like my irons are really good right now, my putting feels really good, and I really feel like I can do it.  I feel really motivated to do it.
Q.  Talk about 16 if you would, that terrific birdie and the gallery goes nuts.  Can you kind of feel the excitement build?
MICHELLE WIE:  It was pretty amazing after I made that chip.  The applause was really loud.  That's why I play, to have those moments.  It's so wonderful, you can't really put it in words.  You just feel really good.  That's why I'm doing this, to feel those moments.
Q.  After the thing with the bugs, you went off to the right a couple times, then you went off to the left a couple times.  Did you overcompensate do you think?
MICHELLE WIE:  No.  I mean, I think it's very natural to compensate maybe or overcompensate.  Like I said, I played around with it, but eventually it went straight, so that was a success.
Q.  Early, the first 30 minutes, 60 minutes, the swing was off a little bit, the right shots that he talked about.  Is that nerves or is that just one of the days of golf?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, it was just my evil twin sister playing (laughter).
Q.  What's it like for you playing with so much attention being paid to everything you do?
MICHELLE WIE:  I like it.  I mean, I'm very grateful for it.  I think that if I didn't have these fans, if I didn't have the critics, it wouldn't be as much fun.  All these people rooting for you, it's just wonderful.  I love it.
Q.  There was a minor issue with your hip yesterday.  Did that get worked out and was that at all a problem today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, it was a little hurting, you know.  I went to the trailer here, and they were really wonderful to help me out, and I went in yesterday and I went in this morning, and it feels really good right now, so I'm good.
Q.  Do you know what kind of bugs they were on the second hole, and were you nervous that they might be a bee?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, they were not a bee.  They were pretty big, though, and they don't want    those bugs do not want me to find out what kind of bugs they were, because I am going to go out and kill them.  I'm calling the exterminator tomorrow (laughter).
Q.  The fog, do you think it followed you from Rhode Island?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think the fog fell in love with me, I don't know.  It's following me around.  It's kind of annoying.  You know, it was interesting.  I mean, it was actually quite nice because I had to wake up really early this morning, and because of the fog, I went back home and I slept a little, so it was good.
Q.  So the two hour delay didn't mess with your mindset, getting into golf mentality and then having to put it off?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, it was nice because I got to go back home; it wasn't like the U.S. Open where I had to wait in the clubhouse.  I got to go back home, sleep on the couch.  I finished reading my book, and it was nice.
Q.  On the par 5, 17th, your drive was left and then your first attempt to come out didn't go very far.  Was it the lie you had or were you blocked in where you were there?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I didn't really have a good lie.  I was trying to get more than I could have.  That tree over there, it was just I kind of almost got scared at the last moment and wish I didn't, but that's what happened.
Q.  Has there been a time when you've had to take four penalty strokes?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, when I was like 12 maybe (laughter).
Q.  Was the softness of the course a factor?
MICHELLE WIE:  It felt like it dried up a lot from yesterday and the day before.  It felt like it was rolling a lot more than it did, and I think with the heat and with the sun, I think it's going to get faster and faster.
TODD BUDNICK:  Thank you, Michelle, and good luck tomorrow.
