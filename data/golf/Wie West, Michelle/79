 Q.  Wind today obviously no joke.  How big of a factor do you think that was in your round?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just got a couple unlucky bounces, you know.  Just definitely when you're not swinging it well, you know, definitely playing in the wind is a lot harder.   
Yeah, just I hit a lot of good ts out there, a lot of good shots.  Just got a little bit unlucky.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.   
 Q.  Does it give you confidence knowing you're close, it's just getting couple putts to fall and stuff like that?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, you know, my game has been starting to feel good.  Starting to feel healthy again.  Just have to take one of these days.   
I played hard out there.  Hopefully I can play better tomorrow.   
 Q.  If there is anything specifically you need to do tomorrow to get back in it, can you point that out?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just a couple more iron shots.  (Indiscernible - wind interference.)
