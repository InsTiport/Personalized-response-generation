Q. How are you feeling?
MICHELLE WIE: Feeling good, yeah.  The injections went really well in New York, and feeling good.  Really excited to be out here playing.
Q. You had some time off after the U.S. Open.  What did you get up to?
MICHELLE WIE: Nothing much.  Just went into the doctor's office and I did a fun shoot with Nike up in New York which is kind of fun, and pretty much just a lot of rehab, physio, a lot of ice and rest.
Q. For the Nike shoot, what was it like hanging out with Genie Bouchard in the city?
MICHELLE WIE: It was fun.  It was a cool day because I got to be part of her world and she got to be part of mine.  It was a great crossover day.  Got to teach her how to play golf.  It was her first time on the range and she did really awesome, and then she gave me a couple of points for tennis.
Obviously I couldn't do much for my neck.  I was really bummed not being able to really play, but yeah, it was a fun day.
Q. And now we're over in Scotland for two straight weeks of links golf.  They have been doing this for a while on the men's side.  What does it mean to have this event leading into the RICOH event next week?
MICHELLE WIE: It's amazing.  I've always wanted to do this, to spend two weeks here.  It's so much fun.  I think one week is not enough to really understand links golf and try to do well here.
But it's amazing.  These two golf courses, Dundonald and Kingsbarns, doesn't get much better than that.  I'm really excited.  Hopefully the weather stays okay.  But the rain and the wind is what we're here for, so we're prepared for anything.
Q. What do you like about the challenges of links golf?
MICHELLE WIE: It's so different.  It just feels like golf how it should be played.  It kind of takes you in a time capsule back in the day and it's pretty neat.  It's just completely different.
