 Q. Quite the charge there at the end.   What was working for you out there?   
MICHELLE WIE:   It was just a lot fun today playing with Jane and Caroline.   Just a fun group out there.   Great weather.   Great crowds.  
 You know, I missed a lot of putts early on, but I really took advantage of the parâ€‘5s today, which I think really helped.   
 Q.   You're done pretty early in front of the leaders.   What will you do?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I mean, only thing I can do is wait.   I'm not very hopefully at this point.   Couple of good birdies coming down.   
But we'll see.   You never know what might happen.  
   
 Q.   You've been playing well as of late.   Has anything clicked for you?  
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, like I said, at the beginning of the season, it's coming along.   It's just taking some time to get together.   I feel like my game is finally coming together slowly.   
Just been patient with my game and working hard at it.   Just nice to see that it paid off this week, and hopefully I can finish strong next week.  
   
 Q.   You played with Jane today.   I know you two are really close.   I saw you all going back and forth on Twitter.   Does that help down the stretch, having her right there with you?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I think it did.   I haven't been in contention to be a while.   I was a little bit nervous, but talking to Jane it really calmed my nerves down a lot.   
You know, it's just always fun playing with a friend out there.
