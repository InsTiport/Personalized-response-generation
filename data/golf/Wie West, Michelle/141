 Q.   Incredibly tough golf course.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Coming off the emotion of winning last week in Hawaii, what extra challenges did that bring to this week?  
MICHELLE WIE:   I think I was just tired from last week.   So many emotions and bit of celebrating and travel coming back here.   Just a little bit tired.   I think I got some good rest.  
It's a great golf course, a really tough golf course.   Plays a lot different than last week.   I think that was the biggest challenge.   
Just kind of treating this like a major golf course.  
   
 Q.   This course is particularly tough.   What is it about this course that really fits your game?  
MICHELLE WIE:   I don't know.   I think it's long, which obviously plays advantage to me.   But it's just the way you need to have good iron play.   Small greens out here.   I missed a couple greens the last couple days, but hopefully tomorrow I can hit a couple more.
