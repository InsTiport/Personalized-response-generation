  Q. Very, very fine ball striking. How would you assess the greens and your ball play today, Michelle?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It was good. There was a lot of pars out there, which was a good thing. I think I just have to capitalize on a couple more birdie holes.   
 Today I just over-read a couple of putts. I thought my stroke was pretty. I think I just have to make one, and I think I'll make them.   
 But I thought I hit the ball pretty well. Made a couple mistakes out there, so hopefully tomorrow I can shoot a low number.  
  
  Q. What is it like to play a major as the fourth event on the schedule?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I never knew any other different way. You know, usually it was my first event or second event of the year, so having four under my belt seems pretty good right now.  
  
  Q. It's hard to believe this is your seventh time here and that you've done so well as a teenager. You're now all of 20 years old. Why do those memories seem to serve you so well and why does your game fit this place?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You just made me feel kind of old, my seventh year here.   
 It's a lot of great memories. Such a great tournament and the fans are so awesome and just walking down 18 hole to the green it's just an awesome feeling.  
  
  Q. And perhaps one day your own name on the plaque there as you make that walk. Michelle, thanks very much. We appreciate it.
