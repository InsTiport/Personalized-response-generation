DANA VONLOUDA:  Thanks, Michelle, for coming in.  Had a great finish there.  Total of 3-under par.  Birdie on the last hole.  Tied for 16th.  Must be happy with the play.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, I was really happy about how I played today.  But I think I could have been a lot better because I missed like a four-footer for birdie and I missed a lot of putts that   -- I think I had a lot of lucky breaks today like the 18th hole I bounced left fortunately on the green and I was pretty good today.  I was really happy with how I played.
Q.  You do look like you have been putting in some bad luck the first two days.  Do you feel like you have gotten as much out of the round as you could have both days?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, I didn't get it all out but it's getting there.  I have been practicing my putting a little bit because the first day wasn't really like unlucky putts.  It was really, I don't know, I didn't really hit it that good, so today I came out in the morning and practiced a little.  I think I was a lot better today.
Q.  Missing to the right, still trying to adjust to the speed of the greens?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, I never noticed that I missed all my putts to the right.  I don't know.  It felt like, I don't know.  It was -- it's not really getting used to the poa annua greens.  It's, I think my stroke isn't that good right now.
Q.  Two days here, you haven't played this course before.  You are getting more comfortable as you go along?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, I am getting more comfortable.  The course is just really beautiful.  I have been hitting my tee shots pretty good today.  I have been getting pretty used to this course.
DANA VONLOUDA:  Let's go ahead and do your birdies.  15.  Do you know what club you hit in?
MICHELLE WIE: 4-iron.  I 2-putted.  I could have made an eagle there.  It was only about like a 9-footer for eagle.
Q.  What was your yardage on the 4-iron shot?
MICHELLE WIE: 197.
DANA VONLOUDA:  No. 4.
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, that one I hit a good shot, I mean, I hit a pitching wedge into there.  Hit it perfectly, had about like a 4-footer for birdie, made that one.
DANA VONLOUDA:  No. 7, the par 5.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I hit really good.  That one I hit a really long drive but I hit it a little bit right into the rough but I hit a 7-iron out of the rough and I didn't even expect it to come close to the green.  I mean, I was just hitting for like a 30-yard shot, just get it up there, but I hit it really solid, just jumped out and just bounced onto the green.  It was really surprising.
DANA VONLOUDA:  How long was the putt, first putt?
MICHELLE WIE: About 42 feet.
Q.  Yardage for the 7 iron?
MICHELLE WIE: It was 158 to the front.  160 something  -- 170 something.
DANA VONLOUDA:  Birdie on 9.
MICHELLE WIE: That one, I got  -- I hit a 3-wood off the tee because yesterday I hit driver and I came too close to the green.  But I was in the rough slightly and I hit a 9-iron.  Fortunately it bounced left instead of right.  So I had about a 12-footer for birdie.
DANA VONLOUDA:  Any other questions?
Q.  Did you have any sort of a chance for birdie on the par 5, 3rd hole?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, that one, if I just hit a 5-iron it would have been perfect on the green and 2-putt.
Q.  You said if you had hit a 5-iron?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I hit a 4-iron.  Because I had a bad lie on the  -- it was uphill lie, I didn't think I could hit it that far, but I accidentally did.
Q.  One of the spectators said that on 15 he thought maybe you dropped your earring or something?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, I didn't pierce my ear and it was just  -- it just fell out.  If I did have pierced ears it would have been pulled out my ear and I would have been crying and bleeding.
Q.  Leader is like 11-under par.  Do you care much about the people in front of you right now?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, I think I positioned myself very well today.  I mean, I am really happy with 3-under par right now and I just have to play two more good rounds and I think I am in the hunt.
DANA VONLOUDA:  Thank you, Michelle.
MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.
