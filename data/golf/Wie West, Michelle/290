  Q. Nice recovery today, a couple under. How were you better today than yesterday?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Oh, definitely putting-wise. I felt a lot more confident with my putter, and just a couple more shots in the fairway, more shots into the green. Yeah, I felt like I had a lot of great up-and-downs today. There was a lot of moments during the round where it could have gone either way and I just feel like I grinded and I just really played it through. Yeah, I'm proud of myself for shooting under par today, and I think it just opens it up for Saturday and Sunday. I'm just really excited.   
  
  Q. Do you like where you are now going into the final two days?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, I mean, if it was in a perfect world I'd be a lot more under, but considering the circumstances, I felt like I did a really good job today, and just keep doing the good things good and keep improving on what I need to improve on for the next two days. Just play steady, make a lot of birdies and try to eliminate the bogeys. I think it'll be good.   
  
  Q. Are you feeling any pressure because it's your last LPGA tournament for the year, and if you do really well you could secure a card for next year?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I'm not really thinking about that right now. If I play good, everything will take care of itself. That's what I'm going to focus on, just playing my round. You know, it's my last tournament so I want to end on a good note, and hopefully I'll be a really good one.  
  
  Q. What did you think of Alena and Maude?  
 MICHELLE WIE: I think they're very good players. I think they both have very steady games. They both struggled a little bit today coming in, but she's a very good ball-striker, a very good putter. They're very fun to play with, great playing partners.  
  
  Q. You know that Maude was impressed to play with you?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Really? Yeah, she was great, really nice girl and really good ball-striker. I liked her ball flight, and it was fun playing with her.   
  
  Q. Is it as much fun playing these days?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's a lot more fun, actually, when you feel like your head's not going to come off. Yeah, it's fun again. I realize that it's just a game and I'm starting to have a lot of fun out there. Before it was a grind, it was a real struggle. Now it's just -- I'm feeling like it's a game, and I'm just going to take it as a game because it is a game. So I'm just going to go out there and have fun because that's what golf is all about.   
  
  Q. What do you look for in a good caddie?  
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, someone that I get along with, someone that will steady my ship out there. A caddie is the one person that I can lean on during the round, and it's someone that I can talk to, someone that I feel comfortable with, someone that obviously gives me the right yardages and can read the greens.   
  
  Q. Do you have friends in the gallery? I noticed you were talking to some people.   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, they came over, a couple friends from college.
