 Q.  Did you go and pump some iron before your drive on the 18?  
MICHELLE WIE: I did hit it pretty far.  I think that break was pretty good for me.  I was getting a little bit tired, a little hot out there and I just felt refreshed.  Ate some watermelon, felt good.   
 Q.  Wonderful start.  You went yesterday without a bogey and you continue that momentum on the front nine.  Going out in 32, you had such a smile on your face.  You really seemed to be enjoying it?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun this week.  That was my goal at the beginning of the week, just play as hard as I can and have fun.  I've been having some great groups out there.  Just having a lot of fun.   
 Q.  How are you aware of the leaderboard?  I saw just watching the putt that Ariya narrowly missed and gives you a two-shot lead going into tomorrow, a lead you haven't had for a while.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, but it's fun, it's fun being in contention.  It's fun being in this position.  I'm going to go out with the same mind-set that I had today and just go out and play as hard as I can.   
As much as I watch the leaderboard or watch anyone else, there's so many things I can't control out there tomorrow.  I'm just going to go out there and have fun and try to play the way I played the last three days.   
 Q.  It's been a tiring three days and you said you were in bed before 8.00 last night.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I really tried to make it past but I didn't.   
 Q.  Back on top of the leaderboard, can you talk us through it and how you felt?  
MICHELLE WIE: I had a really great front nine.  Made some putts.  I just had fun out there today.  I had a lot of fun.  I just played hard and I'm proud of myself for the position I've put myself in for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You said you had a lesson with David Leadbetter back in Florida.  What exactly did you take away from the lessons that you had with him and are they working with him?  They must be, obviously.  
MICHELLE WIE: I'm going to keep that to myself, but I'm really grateful that he took time out of his busy week.  I know he was working with Rafa and a lot of the other guys and I begged him to come watch me putt a little bit.  But you know, he's a great coach and we worked on a couple of really good things.   
 Q.  You must be really pumped to be leading this tournament.  Are there any nerves?  
MICHELLE WIE: You know, there definitely is some butterflies out there, but it's exciting getting that feeling again and being in this position.  It's a great feeling.  It's really exciting.  I just want to go out there and have fun tomorrow and really enjoy it.   
 Q.  Are you actually feeling excited?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm feeling very excited.  I had so much fun out there today, and being in the last group again for tomorrow, I'm really excited for that.   
 Q.  Does it feel like a long time ago that you were winning that U.S. Open?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yes and no.  I think the feeling of it, it comes back.  You know, it doesn't feel that long ago, but I guess it is.  But I'm just going to not really think about that.  Doesn't matter how long it's been since I've been in contention or anything.  I'm really proud of myself for putting myself in this position.  I'm going to enjoy it tomorrow and play as hard as I can and try it do my best.   
 Q.  What pleased you most about your round?  
MICHELLE WIE: I actually had fun out there today.  I stayed patient.  I put myself in some good positions.  Overall, I just had a really good mentality about the round, and I had fun, and that's kind of my main focus for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Do you think that tomorrow, when you wake up, what do you have to tell yourself before your round starts to finish strongly and even win?  
MICHELLE WIE: You know, I've been in this position before, and that's what I practice for is to be in this position.  That's what I wake up and practice long hours for is to be in this position, and try to do my best in it.  But you know, it's not a different day.  It's playing the same 18 holes, and you've just got to make some birdies.
