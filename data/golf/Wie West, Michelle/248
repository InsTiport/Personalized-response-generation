 Q. Opening round of 69, how would you assess your play today? 
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, a couple of loose tee shots on the front nine, but I feel pretty good. I just hung in there and grinded it out. You know, these greens are difficult, but a pretty solid round and hopefully make a lot more birdies the next couple of rounds.

 Q. Breezy out there, how do you enjoy those sort of conditions?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it got really breezy. Kind of reminded me of home a little bit with the weather and everything. It definitely was challenging a couple of the holes with the wind like that.

 Q. Your first win on the LPGA Tour came recently in MÃ©xico, how much did that mean to you, because obviously you had been expected to win for some time?
 MICHELLE WIE: It was great and so much fun and I want to do it again, and I just want to keep getting better. It was a great week. 

 Q. How much did the Solheim Cup do for your confidence, because you played so beautifully there?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's just a lot of fun. The Solheim Cup was a great learning experience and I just learned a lot of things from a lot of experienced players and gained a lot of confidence.

 Q. You were 120 floors up the Burj Dubai; what was that like?
 MICHELLE WIE: Horrific and scary but one of most awesome things I've ever done. It was cool. I'm really scared of heights and even on the elevator, I was nervous and my hands were sweaty.

 Q. Any plans before you play again? 
 MICHELLE WIE: No, I have to study unfortunately, so I'll be in my room all day studying.
