 Q.   What happened on 10 that seemed to get your day off to a bad start?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, I snapâ€‘hooked it off the tee.   My backswing caught the weeds, topped it went in the Heather or the Fescue.   Ran from Fescue to Fescue, lost the ball, went back to the Fescue, chipped out, and almost made my putt for a 7, but had an 8.   Everything that could go wrong went wrong today.   But I'm proud of myself for making three birdies in the last four holes or five holes.   So, hopefully I can get a couple more birdies tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about how difficult that is to come back after the first hole of the championship to try to keep your composure?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I mean, I hit a couple of good shots after that.   Just didn't really work out.   It's just tough on this golf course once you get started on the wrong foot.   But hopefully the last three birdies the last couple of holes, I'll have some momentum for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You've played this course in different conditions when it's colder.   How different was it today?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, they put the tee box up on every single hole.   So it made it a little bit different from the practice rounds, but, you know, this is just a bad round today.   Hopefully, I can bounce back tomorrow, make a couple more birdies and not have ten happen again.  
   
 Q.   Did you just start hitting it better over the last few holes?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, a little bit.
