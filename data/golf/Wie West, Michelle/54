 Q.  Talk about what your neck was like, the battles you had, especially after the delay.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean it was -- I was so happy to be able to tee it up today.  I didn't hit a single golf ball since KPMG.  Didn't hit a single shot on the golf course here.  I knew I needed a small miracle and I was excited, so giddy playing today.  I was happy playing.   
Felt okay, then the rain delay hit.  Went back on the range, it was raining.  Felt okay and then I hit one drive at the end that seized it back up.  I called the rules official over.  I was ready to pull out.  I couldn't swing.  Then thankfully the physios came, we had 15 minutes, and I made it through.   
If someone had told me that I was going to shoot even par in the last four holes in the rain, I would have told them that would never happen.  I'm proud of myself and my caddie for keeping me in there.  I positioned myself okay.  Three more days to go, so I'm excited about that.   
 Q.  What exactly do you have to go through physically when your swing -- we saw you coming in, sort of letting a hand off the club.  What kind of pain are you battling each and every swing?  
MICHELLE WIE: It's pretty sharp pain.  Thankfully it's nothing with the disk.  I'll be fine after next week.  My doctor said it happened at the worst time possible.  It's just a neck sprain.  Kind of sharp when I hit.   
But I'm definitely at least a solid club and half shorter now, so I'm thinking my way around.  We're making it work.   
 Q.  How do you make it work tomorrow?  
MICHELLE WIE: I'll be fine.  Sleep it off.  Do some physical therapy tonight.  Do it again tomorrow morning.  I'll get a good night's rest and I'll be good to go.   
 Q.  Can you tell us how it originally happened, final round of the KPMG?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.  I was warming up on Sunday of KPMG.  I just hit one shot and I felt it go.  And I was playing and it was fine and then the -- I think the 16th hole I hit one shot up the hill and it went again and it got bad.  It was strange.  It wasn't too bad, and then all of a sudden I tried to hit golf balls back at home on Thursday and it completely seized up.   
Thankfully the MRIs are all clean.  It has nothing to do with my disk.  So that was the best news that I could get.  It's just pain management at this time to get through.  I'll be fine.   
 Q.  You said that you would be better after this week is through.  What have doctors told you it's going to take to feel better?  
MICHELLE WIE: A lot of anti-inflammatories, ice and time.  That's what I didn't have this week.  We're trying to get a two-week process back in a couple of days.  With all the help, my doctor is here, through my team, it's a miracle that I even played today.  I'm really grateful for this opportunity.  I finished today.  I feel really good about that.   
I have a whole day tomorrow and I'm really excited to play the rest.   
 Q.  You mentioned you didn't get a chance to go around this course and hit golf shots until today.  How difficult was it to navigate the round today?  
MICHELLE WIE: My caddie did a great job of scoping out the golf course.  I made Danielle hit every shot that I needed to hit.  I was telling her to hit every single shot.  So it was good.   
My caddie did a great job scoping out the golf course.  I walked all 18 and I putted and chipped, and I think that helped a lot.   
 Q.  What do you have to do physically between now and tomorrow's tee time to get yourself ready?  
MICHELLE WIE: I have a nice traction device that I'm on that makes me look really attractive, ice and unfortunately some meds.   
 Q.  Did you get rear-ended (inaudible)?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.  I don't think that really has anything to do with it.  I just unfortunately have a long neck, like a baby giraffe is what they call me.  So it just happens.   
 Q.  You and your caddie looked like you were laughing a little bit while it was all happening.  What were those conversations like?  
MICHELLE WIE: I think you have to.  You have to make light of the situation.   
I was on 16, I was so nervous about that shot.  I could be here for like five hours if I don't get it over the water.  I was like, please go over the water.  We had fun out there.  Honestly, I had blast.  I felt lucky to be able to tee it up today.  I did not think I was going to be able to play.  I'm happy to be out here to play this wonderful golf course and play our national championship.   
 Q.  How important is it for you not to have to come back here first thing in the morning?  
MICHELLE WIE: I kind of wish I finished the final four holes today tomorrow morning.  I'm happy to be done.  Hopefully tomorrow the rain will stay away and we can finish.
