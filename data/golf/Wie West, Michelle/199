  Q. So great effort by the U.S. You've been part of a winning team in '09. Just sum up your emotions on this week and not being able to pull it out as a team?   
 MICHELLE WIE: We've played hard. We fought hard. I mean, like I said even from the beginning of the week, they're a strong team and they played well. But you know what, losing sucks, and we need to keep this feeling for 2013.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about your match today? You and Suzann are buddies, but for her to birdie the last few holes, I mean, just talk about that.   
 MICHELLE WIE: I mean, she's a great player. She's one of the strongest players, and it was a tough match today.   
 I think it was going back and forth, back and forth all day. For her to birdie the last three holes was pretty amazing. I felt like I matched her back on 17, but just once your opponent does that, it's hard to come back.   
 At the same time, I really look up to her. She's a great match play player. I saw her at Sybase, and I think no one wanted it more than her. So half of me is happy for her, And half of me, losing sucks.
