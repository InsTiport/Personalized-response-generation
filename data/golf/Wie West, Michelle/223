   THE MODERATOR: All right, Michelle. Thanks for coming in. The second-round leader right now in the clubhouse. Looking like you're going to be the leader tonight, too, at 10-under par, three-stroke lead. If you would, just take us through today, not quite as good as yesterday, but still pretty decent. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, you know, I felt good out there today, a couple of putts. You know, I had a lot of putts coming back. I just need to get my speed a little bit more down. But just going out there and grinding and just trying my hardest every day.
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Michelle?

 Q. Do you feel you could have done better because you missed a few makeable putts?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, but you end every round thinking every round could be better. There's like a shot here and there, but I went out there and I tried my hardest. I played my hardest out there, I gave it my all. I'm happy with my round today and hopefully tomorrow I can make a lot more birdies.

 Q. Winnepeggers have been accustomed to you getting hole-in-ones. You weren't able to deliver another one today. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. I tried. Didn't quite work out. 

 Q. What are some of the highlights from the round?
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know. I mean compared to yesterday nothing was that dramatic. I had a couple of good par-5s, a couple of good par-3s, but just went out there. There's not really a big highlight there, I guess. 

 Q. A couple times this year you've had a couple of good rounds, in the 60s to start off and then the third round hasn't quite been the same as the first two. Is your game getting to the point now where it's time to start stringing some rounds together?
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know if it's been a couple of times this year. I think it's just like sometimes you have bad weeks and sometimes you have good weeks, but I'm just going out there and I'm not thinking tomorrow's the third round or tomorrow's the final round. I'm just going out there and focusing on every shot and just playing my hardest. 

 Q. Could you talk, maybe everybody asks you this question, just about the different crowds and the reception you're getting?
 MICHELLE WIE: The crowds are phenomenal. I went out there, they're very supportive, they're very respectful of the game. 
 It was just really great that they're all out there, and I feel really grateful that they are.

 Q. Michelle, are you keeping an eye on the people who are coming up behind you? Does that impact your game at all?
 MICHELLE WIE: No, I really try not to. I just really tried to play my own game today, and as hard as that is, you do look at the scoreboard a lot, but I really try not to and I really try to focus on my own game.

 Q. Does it help when you're playing a so-so round, but when your fellow competitors in your group are making birdies, does that push you and get you more focused?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, when people are making birdies, that makes you wonder that you should be making birdies as well. But they played great today. But it was a fun round. I always like getting paired with them, and we had a lot of fun out there today.

 Q. Michelle, what's different about this week than any other week? Is something coming together for you?
 MICHELLE WIE: No. I mean I don't really like to think about it that way. You know, you work hard every week. Like I said, some weeks turn out good, some weeks turn out bad. 
 You know, this week I'm just trying to play my own game, not really doing anything more special or trying any harder, just going out there, having fun, trying to focus on every shot and try and make it happen.

 Q. Talking about the crowd, do you think the hole-in-one yesterday had an impact on the crowd pulling for you today? Do you notice anything different?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think they were very disappointed on 11 today when I made a bogey. 
 But you know, it's really great. You know, hole-in-ones are always awesome. 

 Q. Michelle, what's your status at Stanford University?
 MICHELLE WIE: I'm attending. School starts after Arkansas, end of September and I'll be a senior. Or a red shirt senior, so I'll be there for another year. 

 Q. Michelle, could you give us maybe in a capsule how much work goes in behind the scenes to make it look so easy out there? I know sometimes it might not seem so easy for you, but from a spectator's point of view you do in a lot of ways make it look easy, but we don't see the time you spend on the practice greens and all that stuff. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. It's a lot of hours, a lot of grinding, a lot of travel, but you know, it's just what you have to do. Everyone does it, and it's a lot of hard work. Everyone works really hard out here.

 Q. I may have missed it, but yesterday you seemed to be grabbing at your back a little more. I didn't see that as much today. Was it bothering you at all today?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah. It's -- it's -- it's what it is. 

 Q. Michelle, you've had a period without victories since your last one. Does that get frustrating for you and do you think that a win here this weekend would really turn the corner on your career?
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, it is frustrating when you don't win, but there's nothing you can do about it. All you can do is look forward, just try and do your best every step of the way; and that's what I'm trying to do, just trying to go out there and try my hardest.
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Michelle. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.
