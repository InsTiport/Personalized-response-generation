CRAIG SMITH:  Michelle Wie, even par today, 1 under for the championship.

RHONDA GLENN:  Michelle, even par 71, a tough last hole.  What happened off the tee, start with that.
 MICHELLE WIE:  I mean, I didn't hit it that bad, I just, it just went through the fairway, it had a bad bounce.  I had a weird lie on that.  It was like I was partly in a divot, and it was a little bit strange.  But I don't know, that 3-putt shouldn't have come out.

RHONDA GLENN:  What was the second shot?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I hit a 4-iron second shot.

RHONDA GLENN:  Overall it was a great day for you.
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I mean I was 2-over after 7 or something, and I came back, and I was really proud of myself for that.  But I just made a couple of mistakes, and hopefully I'll be making less mistakes tomorrow and do good.
Q.  At the Nabisco, how was it different here than that?
 MICHELLE WIE:  At the Nabisco, you can shoot some birdies, and you know your opponents are going to shoot some birdies, too.  And over here, you never know what's going to happen.   You can be 5-over, and the next time she can be 3-under, you never know what's going to happen.
Q.  How about the atmosphere?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I like it.  It's a little bit different than the Nabisco.
Q.  How?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know, it's different.  I can't really explain it.
Q.  What will your mindset be going into tomorrow?  Will you be looking to score?  Do you feel you're in the tournament and can win it?
 MICHELLE WIE:  It was my goal to shoot 4-under, I have to shoot 3-under tomorrow .
Q.  Do you feel you still have a chance?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I mean the conditions are going to get harder on this course, the scores are going to drop, so I don't know.
Q.  Michelle, if you do get under par for the tournament and you wind up on the leaderboard, but still not 4-under, is that a disappointment?
 MICHELLE WIE:  A little bit.  Like in Nabisco I wanted to shoot 8-under, but I shot 7-under, so that was okay.  But I feel like I should shoot 4-under.  I could have been 3-under, but I think that -- I think that just happens.
