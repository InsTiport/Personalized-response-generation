 Q. Just kind of take me through today's round. I know it wasn't the finish you were hoping for, but still a good score on what was a tough, tough day. 
 MICHELLE WIE: I mean, it was a hard day. I don't think I played in more difficult conditions ever. 
 You know, I made some long putt coming in, and Brittany played awesome. You know, I'm proud of the way I hung in there today.

 Q. In terms of the whole week what you can take from it. You put together four great rounds of golf, that's got to be a good feeling knowing going forward? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure. I feel good. I think coming in I had a lot of clutch shots that I could really take a lot of positives from. It feels good to be back in contention again.
