 Q. What are you doing now that you weren't doing th first day?
 MICHELLE WIE: I'm making a lot more putts than I did the first day. I didn't make anything. I'm just trying to hit fairways and greens and give myself opportunities for birdies. There were a couple hard pins out there today, so just trying to play with my head and be consistent.

 Q. You're 2-Under now. You got some 10s and 12s under. Do you feel that you have a shot on Sunday?
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, I feel like anything can happen on Sunday. All I can do is try to play the best I can, and that's try to hit a low score, hit some more fairways and some more greens and make some more puts and shoot a lower score.

 Q. How low can you go on this course, do you think?
 MICHELLE WIE: Like I said, anything can happen. Obviously I want to go really low, but I'm not going to focus on that tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm going to focus on being consistent and hitting fairways and greens and giving myself a lot of opportunities to make putts. 
 I think that I did that fairly well today, but I'll do it better tomorrow.

 Q. You had a pretty wild 18th there. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, I'm tired after that par. It took a lot out of me. The lie that I had for my chip was the worst lie I've ever had for anything. But I'm proud of myself that I pulled it off, and tomorrow hopefully I can have that putt for birdie instead of par.

 Q. I am from Colombia. As you know, we have a young amateur champion. She's 18 years old. Do you think she should turn pro now or finish the three years? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know. It's her decision.

 Q. She played pretty well in the U.S. Open. 
 MICHELLE WIE: That's her decision.
