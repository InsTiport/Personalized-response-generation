   THE MODERATOR: Welcome.  
 MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.   
 THE MODERATOR: Good playing today. Just some thoughts on the round.   
 MICHELLE WIE: Cold, it was very cold out there, especially during the end. But it was a lot of fun playing with Maria and Ai. It was a lot of fun playing with them. It's a tough course. You've got to be patient out there, and hopefully tomorrow do the same thing and hopefully have a couple more birdies.   
 THE MODERATOR: Just want to run through lengths of birdie putts. Birdie on 1?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Probably about 15 feet.  
 THE MODERATOR: 6?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Probably like 12 feet.  
 THE MODERATOR: Okay, 10?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Like 3 feet, 4 feet.  
 THE MODERATOR: 11?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Same thing.   
 THE MODERATOR: 14, how far out were you and what did you hit?   
 MICHELLE WIE: 14, I hit a pitching wedge about 115.   
 THE MODERATOR: That was three feet?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.   
 THE MODERATOR: 16?   
 MICHELLE WIE: 7-iron to about 20 feet.  
 THE MODERATOR: And 18?   
 MICHELLE WIE: On the green in two, so about two-putt from about 40 feet.  
  
  Q. What club did you hit on your other birdies and what clubs did you hit on 18 to reach the green in two, and how far out were you?   
 MICHELLE WIE: First hole pitching wedge, and I don't know the rest, and 3-wood on 18.  
  
  Q. From how far?   
 MICHELLE WIE: 240.  
  
  Q. What are the keys both mentally and physically on a day like today that's a long day, a cold day, and a long course?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I guess just being patient. You're not going to play fast today. You're not going to be warm.   
 So just kind of accepting those facts and just kind of having fun.  
  
  Q. How hard is it to learn to be patient as a pro? Is that something that took you a while to learn how to do?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I think so. I think that naturally I'm a quite impatient person, so it's always a work in progress to try to be patient. So I'm still working at it.  
  
  Q. Obviously, you have the length, but it certainly looked like your irons were working well for you today. Was that the case?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I think just kind of go out there and get into rhythm. It's only day one, so hopefully day two, day three, day four, it will all still be good.  
  
  Q. You had a couple that were within three or four feet. So it's obviously, if you can keep that going throughout the week, you should be in good shape.   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, that would be great.  
  
  Q. How much of an advantage is length out here?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I think that it's an advantage, but obviously it's a very tight golf course, so you have to be on the fairway. I think that you have to have a combination of both.  
  
  Q. It's pretty penal if you're off the fairway, isn't it?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's a tough golf course.  
  
  Q. The talk before the tournament was on how difficult this course is and yet some players, including yourself, have shot some pretty impressive numbers. Are you surprised at how many players are under par?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I saw Amanda's score in the morning, and I was like she played really well. I was trying to go out there and shoot a low score. It is a tough golf course. It is.   
 THE MODERATOR: Coming in did you see 7-under out there?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I did. I was like she played really well today.  
  
  Q. How many bad swings do you think you had today?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know. I think in every round there are always a couple, but, yeah, a couple here and there.  
  
  Q. And how many putts within 10 feet did you have on the front nine that you didn't make?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I had quite a few, actually. But I think the greens are pretty tricky here, so it's hard to read a couple of them.  
  
  Q. What classes do you still have to -- you talked yesterday about going to school and still taking classes. What are you taking?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Right now it's spring break, so I have nothing to study. I'm reading for leisure.  
  
  Q. How long till you graduate? Do you know what year would you be considered?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Next March I'd be graduating.  
  
  Q. Do you plan to do that by next March?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you play golf better today than you did on your finals?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know. I think a lot better than I did in my finals (laughing).  
  
  Q. What would it mean to get your first U.S. win? Is that something you think about? They mentioned it on TV. Does that matter to you?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it matters. It's still day one, so there is a lot of golf to be played until round four. So just going to go out there and think about each shot.
