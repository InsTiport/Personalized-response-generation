Q. How were you able to bounce back from the 76 and play so well the last two days of the tournament?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I just really was not feeling well the first, you know, two days.  You know, third and fourth day, I just started just lying down in the fairway (laughing).  I was just trying to conserve energy.  Just rest as much as I could, just try to catch up, and felt better the last two days.
Yeah, my caddie helped me through and just kind of motivating me to make birdies.  You know, it's tough out here.  You play a couple under par, jump way up.  Definitely tried to stay motivated.
Q. It's going to be your best finish of the Asian Swing.  How much motivation does that give you going into CME next week?
MICHELLE WIE: For sure, yeah.  It was tough, you know, coming out of surgery, just literally no days of practice before coming out and threw myself in.  I definitely gained a lot of confidence over the last two weeks.  I'm really excited for the last week.
Q. How are the new clubs treating you now?  Are you used to them?
MICHELLE WIE: Good.  Yeah, yeah.
