 Q. Just seemed to fall off, you never could seem to get anything going, because there were birdie chances early on. 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I just didn't hit some good shots. But you know, it's just hard when the wind is blowing, you don't really feel like your A Game, it kind of gets magnified. I can't wait to get out there tomorrow and make some birdies early on. 

 Q. Can you talk about how big of a factor the wind was out there this afternoon?
 MICHELLE WIE: It didn't make anything easier, that's for sure. You know, just hit a couple of bad shots and didn't really make a lot of putts, and you know, it was the kind of day where it just was -- I didn't play very well. I felt like the last couple of holes, I felt like I was hitting the ball a lot more solidly and I'm excited for tomorrow.
