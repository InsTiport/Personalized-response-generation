 Q.   All right.   We're here with Michelle Wie, opening round 67, 4‑under par, tied for the lead.   Talk us through your day.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, it was a fun day out there today.   You know, I love my playing partners.   Good crowd.   A little bit cold in the morning, but happy with my round.  
   
 Q.   You started off with two birdies in your first three holes, kind of gave a couple back, and then you had that eagle on 10.   Can you talk about that?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   You know, I started off hot, and then I had a little three‑putt, just couldn't get anything going after that, but you know, the eagle is always nice.  
   
 Q.   And then ending on a high note, you stuffed it at No. 18 and then made the putt.   Talk about how that kind of gives you confidence going into tomorrow.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   You know, I think any under‑par round on this golf course is great, and it's nice that I made the putt on the last hole.  
And I'm real excited for the next three days.   Hopefully I can do more of those.  
   
 Q.   And then finally I know you were talking in the media center about looking forward to some of those Texas eateries.   Have you gotten to hit any of those up and any more plans for the rest of the week?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   Oh, yeah.   It'll be probably‑‑ it might be ribs every night.   I did ribs last night again.   And I'm definitely probably going to make another appearance at another rib place this week.  
Maybe sprinkle in a couple of Tex‑Mex joints, but it's a good eating week for sure.  
   
 Q.   Well, go out and enjoy it.   Thank you for your time and best of luck the rest of the week.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Thank you.
