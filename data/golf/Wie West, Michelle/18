Q. Can you talk about the golf course today, the wet conditions?
MICHELLE WIE: It's incredible that we played today and got a practice round in yesterday.  The greens staff did an amazing job.  I mean the greens were perfectly fine.  The fairways are fine.  You would not have known that it rained that much.
Q. So you didn't have to deal with mud on the ball today?
MICHELLE WIE: I had a couple.
Q. Did it cost you anything?  You only had one bogey.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I was fortunate on a couple of lies but, yeah, I mean considering how much rain it got, I don't think it was that bad, really.
Q. How much practice were you able to get in this week?
MICHELLE WIE: I got 18 holes on Monday and 9 holes on Wednesday.
Q. How was that different from like your normal one?
MICHELLE WIE: I would play a lot more golf.  It's actually kind of nice.  Tuesday I didn't come out to the golf course at all.  I kind of completely took an off day.  That was actually quite nice.
Q. What did you do?
MICHELLE WIE: I just chilled, worked out, did my rehab stuff, did a whole lot of nothing.
Q. How do you compare the golf course yesterday with 9 holes to today?
MICHELLE WIE: It was pretty similar, actually.  Yesterday when I got out there practice rounds are now open, I was like should I get my canoe out and start rowing.  It wasn't really bad yesterday.
Pretty impressive.
Q. Did you have to change your strategy at all when you knew you'd be playing in such wet conditions?
MICHELLE WIE: Knowing this golf course only in wet conditions, I didn't really have to think much differently, just came in thinking it was going to be rainy and stormy.  I saw the forecast last week when I was home and it didn't look good.  I kind of came in with that mindset.
Q. Do you change your technique when you're hitting a mud ball and, if so, how?
MICHELLE WIE: You think you can do something different and you try to overthink it and -- it happens.  You can't really control it that much.  You just kind of base a game plan sort of off of it and hope for the best.
Q. How does that set the tone for you when you're here as a U.S. Women's Open Champion?
MICHELLE WIE: It's awesome.  Still doesn't seem like completely real to me.  Every time I hear it it's pretty great.
Q. What's the best part of your game right now?
MICHELLE WIE: I don't know.  I'm just having fun out there, really.  Really enjoying playing.  You know, helps to have a fun group.
I'm really enjoying the game right now, just having fun out there and taking it as an adventure and everything as an adventure.  See how it goes.
Q. What was that like having the largest crowd out there so far today?
MICHELLE WIE: It was great.  I felt from the practice rounds even though it was raining, the crowds have been very supportive and especially today, you know, it's great to see everyone out there and hopefully once the weather gets better and better more people will show us.
Q. What is the putting grip?  What's the one now?
MICHELLE WIE: I have to think about it.  I don't know.  Left hand low, I think, right?  Yeah.  Left hand low, right?
Q. You obviously don't fret about it.  You don't worry too much about it anymore.
MICHELLE WIE: No.  At one point I was putting with five different putting grips.  I pretty much can do anything.  Doesn't really bother me.
Q. But you're comfortable.
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I am, yeah.
Q. You talked about having fun.  Did it take awhile for you to be able to enjoy because there could have been some pressure in a U.S. Women's Open, particularly a former winner.
Did it take you awhile to have fun out there and not feel the pressure?
MICHELLE WIE: You always feel the pressure.  You look forward to it the entire year.  It's our National Championship.  If there's -- there's a lot of pressure.
I think this whole year from last year really I just really been focusing on really trying to take the game as a game and play it as a game and just go out there and do your best and, you know, worrying doesn't really get you anywhere.  I'm kind of going out there and just trying to have fun.
Q. Did you take care of yourself on a rainy day in Florida?
MICHELLE WIE: I get cabin fever.  I go crazy.  Yes.
