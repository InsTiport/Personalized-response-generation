Q. When you ended your first round today after playing three holes, you were tied for the lead in the Women's Open.  Did you know that and what did it feel like?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I knew that but I didn't really care, I mean, I just felt good that I finished under par and I just wanted to keep it going, make a couple more putts.  But I mean it was tougher the second round, my putting wasn't -- I mean it felt good, but I just read it a little bit wrong here and there.  It still felt good making a birdie on the last hole.
Q.  You almost holed that shot.  When you walked off the 18th green you looked a little weary.  That's a lot of golf to play in one day.
 MICHELLE WIE:  I am still young, so I mean, I wasn't that tired, but it was kind of weird having only like 30-minute breaks in between and playing three holes.  It was kind of like those three holes were kind of like a warm-up.

Hopefully I will get into better rhythm tomorrow.
Q.  What time did you have to get up this morning?
MICHELLE WIE:  4:15.
Q.  Is that a normal wake-up time for you?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Okay, let's put it this way, my school starts at 8:30, I wake up at like 7:10, 7:15, so kind of early.  I am a very big sleeper.
Q.  What kind is that Hawaiian body clock time?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I have been here for a month.  So I don't even know what time it is in Hawaii.
Q.  Is it fun for you?  Is it pressure?
 MICHELLE WIE:  It's really fun.  Not that fun when I am making bogeys.  It's really fun out there.  I am having a lot of fun.  It's a great golf course.  It's a US Open.  It's a lot of fun.  I don't really feel a lot of pressure.
Q.  If you were at par after four days, four rounds, would that be okay with you?
 MICHELLE WIE:  I want to shoot consistent under-par rounds.  I didn't do that today, but I have two more days so hopefully I can shoot under par.
Q.  How much tougher were the pin placement today?
 MICHELLE WIE:  They were a lot more tucked in, a lot more back, so it was a little bit tougher.

I don't really think it's pin positions.  I just think that I didn't really execute the ball very well.
