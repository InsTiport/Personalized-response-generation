  Q. Michelle, bringing another point to the U.S. side. Can you describe basically what kind of match that was? It looked like a slugfest to me from start to finish.   
 MICHELLE WIE: I mean, it was tough. Helen is the best. God, Helen is just so tough to beat. I just did not want to come to the 18th hole, but it came down to that, and I did I what I needed to do, and I'm just glad I got a point for the U.S.   
  
  Q. You were 3-up after 6, things were on your side, then it started turning the other way. She made a couple mistakes. What did you say to yourself to dig down and keep finishing this thing up?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, I was playing good. If you look at the scores, birdies were made on holes. Helen just played fantastic in a couple holes. I think she played great the whole day. Like I said, it was tough. I had to pull some stuff on her.   
  
  Q. 3-0-1, that sounds pretty good for your first Solheim Cup.   
 MICHELLE WIE: That sounds great.
