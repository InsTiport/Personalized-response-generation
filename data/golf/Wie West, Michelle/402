MODERATOR:  Yesterday you became the youngest to make a cut at an LPGA major by four months and one week.  You had 66 today, ties the low round in a major championship by an amateur.  Great round, do you want to talk about how you feel?
MICHELLE WIE: I really shot good today, and I was really proud of myself.  But I didn't even know what I was shooting, I thought I had to make one more birdie and I kept on going.

Q.  Michelle, your coach is here, what's one of the most important things you've learned from him.  He must be a pretty good coach?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, he's a really good coach, he's standing right there.  He taught me a lot of things, taught me how to play in the rough, and I was hitting the ball really good, and my putting was okay.

Q.  You've missed a few putts for birdie this week, and are you thinking about those, and where you might be if not for those?
MICHELLE WIE:  It's killing me right now.  I could have been second, I think.  It's killing me.

Q.  (Inaudible.) Was it two or three?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think two -- yeah, two.  It's just -- I just hit it great, but it didn't fall in.  It's not my fault.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think I'm pretty good in school.  I have all As except for one.

Q.  Looks like you're going to be in the last group tomorrow with the two leaders.  You haven't seemed like you've had any pressure at all, do you think that will be any pressure, or do you just approach it the same way?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't really put pressure on myself, but it's just the game.  You just have to hit the ball good, putt well, chip well, everything.  It's just a game.

Q.  This many people watching you, is that hard to get used to or do you just not care about that?
MICHELLE WIE:  I'm pretty used to it, because a lot of people have been watching me a long time so I've been really comfortable with the people.  They really didn't bother me.  I was just thank them for supporting me and it's helped me.

Q.  Your dad was saying out there that he didn't think you had hit more than a pitching wedge into a par-4 this week, is that correct?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think so, because I don't think I hit more than a pitching wedge today.  I think I hit a couple of soft 9-irons.

Q.  And how well have you driven the ball this week, because it seemed like today you were just bombing it out there time and again.  How good has it been for you this week?
MICHELLE WIE:  My driver has been going farther and farther each hole.  So by the 16th hole I flew the tree over on the right, and it ran about 310.  I was really surprised.

Q.  On 18 did you give any thought to maybe going for that green in two, after that drive, and how much did you have in?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think I had about like 225 or something.  I thought I'd like to try over again -- if you put it on the green, it's going to roll off the green, if you hit it short, it's going to go into the water.  You just have to make the same old birdie up there.  I've been pitching really well today, I thought if it's a long putt, I'd rather be safe and make a birdie or a par.

Q.  Michelle, are you at all surprised at where you are right now?
MICHELLE WIE:  Actually I am.  I never really realized I would play as good.  And I just kept on going, oh, I've got to -- I just kept on going. 

Q.  What is your ultimate goal, to get on this Tour, to get on the PGA TOUR?  I know this is years away from now, but what is your dream?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, my dream is to play in The Masters.  That's my really ultimate goal.

Q.  What amateur events do you play?
MICHELLE WIE:  I play in the Public Links.  I'm trying to qualify for a U.S. amateur and the U.S. junior, and the -- Women.  And I don't know what other tournaments.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MICHELLE WIE:  I think I'm too busy this year. 

Q.  Where does this round rank in rounds that you've shot?  We heard you say you shot 64.  Have you shot 65 and 66 before?
MICHELLE WIE:  I'd rank it number one, I don't remember how I shot my 64 when I was ten.  And I was really happy with what I shot, because this course is a really tough course, and I'm really proud of myself.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MICHELLE WIE:  I've got to get my passport.

Q.  When do you have to go back to school?
MICHELLE WIE:  My school starts on Tuesday, from spring break.

Q.  What kind of response do you think you'll get when you go back home after this?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think the first thing they're going to ask me is what did you do over spring break.  I don't think they'll know.  They don't watch golf or anything.

Q.  Michelle, will you be eligible for your high school team next year?
MICHELLE WIE: Yes, I will.

Q.  Are you going to play on the women's team or the boy's team?
MICHELLE WIE:  The women's team, because I'm just having a great time out there with my girlfriends. 

Q.  Your mom is out there at the end of the round, she's shaking.  Your dad falls on his knees in emotion.  Who's in charge out there, you, your mom or your dad?
MICHELLE WIE:  I would say me.  They're both the chokers  in the family.

Q.  How much did you play with the boys, how much did it help your game?
MICHELLE WIE:  It helped me a lot, because right before this tournament I played in a men's tournament, I played under par, so I was really confident.  And the course we played on was pretty tough, too.  They really grew the grass.  I was really confident going in here, because I played 68 the third round, too.

Q.  Michelle, you seem so at ease out there, but your dad get enthusiastic, how many times during the round do you tell him to calm down?
MICHELLE WIE:  Every five minutes.  It's like, please.

Q.  How would you assess your total game now, and what do you think is the strongest part, that's the weakest part, what do you want to improve?
MICHELLE WIE: As of today my game is getting better and better every day.  And I think today nothing was really weak.

Q.  Who your golfing heroes?
MICHELLE WIE:  Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Annika, all those good players, and Pat Bradley, JoAnne Carner, they're all really good.

Q.  Can you tell us about how you're spending your free time between rounds here this week?
MICHELLE WIE:  Mainly laying on the bed and watching TV.

Q.  What do you watch?
MICHELLE WIE:  Just anything that's on.

Q.  Can you tell us about your classwork, what math are you taking now?
MICHELLE WIE:   Algebra honors.  Next year I'm taking geometry honors.  I can't miss school next year, because I'm taking three honor courses, so it's impossible.

Q.  Do you take higher stuff?
MICHELLE WIE:  Uh-huh, I'm taking all the honors courses.

Q.  Where do you see yourself in 6 years?
MICHELLE WIE:  In college, starting Stanford, I hope.  I hope I'm on the golf team and doing pretty well in school.
