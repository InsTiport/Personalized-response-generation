  MICHELLE WIE:   Definitely got a couple bad breaks today.   One of those days where in the wind you have to hit it really solid for the wind not to move it so much.
If it was not windy conditions felt like I could have gotten away with a lot of shots.   Just hit just not solidly enough where the wind took it a little bit.
Up and down day.   Pretty windy.   I felt like I made a lot of birdies; just made a couple stupid errors.
Hopefully tomorrow I can go out there and shoot lights out. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I mean, it's one of those days.   It's so windy that bogeys will come unfortunately.   You just got to come back with a birdie.   That what I did great today was never give up and always try to move forward. 

Q.   Did you feel the wind was more unpredictable today?
MICHELLE WIE:   Same as always.   Typical tradewinds. 

Q.   Did you feel you had to press a little bit because you got off to that slow start?
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, it was unlucky, you know.   I thought I hit the perfect shot on 3 and it just flew past and in the bunker.   Just got a couple bad breaks today.   It's just I still have one more day.   I'll see what I can do.   I'll try my best.   That's all I can do.

Q.   Did you have to play more aggressively as the day went on or just try to stay patient? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Just try to stay patient.   You have a game plan.   Have to stick on the game plan.   The game plan works if you stick with it and do it.
Same thing for tomorrow.   I'm not going to change anything.   Just going to try to play the best I can.

Q.   How do you handle conditions like this with the wind?   Obviously it's not easy to play your game.   How do you adapt to these conditions?
MICHELLE WIE:   I think you just got to stay patient and try and hit solid shots.   That's all you can do.   There are so many outside factors I think you have to learn to laugh some of the shots off. 
There were definitely a lot of shots where you think the wind is blowing it this way but blows another way and takes the ball in a completely different direction.   Nothing you can do about it. 
I think you just have to learn to blow it off.
