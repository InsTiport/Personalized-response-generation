  THE MODERATOR:   Well, it is my pleasure to welcome in Michelle Wie.   5‑under today, 7‑under total.   One shot off the lead.   Have to feel very good about the day today.   A little less windy?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, it was still windy but not crazy windy as it was yesterday afternoon.   I'll take 5‑under par.   I knew I could have made a couple more birdies out there on the last couple of holes, but I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   I know you said you feel comfortable this week.   Obviously you're home.   Something about playing in Hawaii that feels more relaxed.   I know me coming here it was hard to think I was going to work.   It feels like you're on vacation.   Do you feel more relaxed being from the state of Hawaii?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Last week I was very relaxed.   This week, I think I'm trying not to put so much pressure on myself.   I'm trying to go out there and have fun.   
I definitely saw a lot of support from the crowd.   They were cheering me on.   I definitely felt that.   It was a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   No bogeys.   Where were you feeling strong about not getting into trouble from spots and not picking up any bogeys today?  
MICHELLE WIE:   I think (indiscernible) did a really good job.   I think we‑‑ there's a lot Top 10s today.   You kind of played it safe on a couple, made some putts.   Then I think it was just good course management.  
   
 Q.   I know coming home you said you are getting really well fed, plenty of good dishes.   Give us the one good spot to eat in this area and your best meal so far this week?  
MICHELLE WIE:   That's tough.   Wow.   My first thought is Uncle Bo's, it's really close to my house.   I feel like I always drive by Leonard's and I cry because I can't have it.   Shaved Ice is a must.   Went to (indiscernible) last week.   But a lot of spots.   I can go on.   I can go on and on about foods.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk on 13?   That kind of did like a full 360 around the cup.   Could you just talk about that putt?  
MICHELLE WIE:   That putt was really, really, really fast.   It was downwind, down grain, downhill and I just barely touched it and I think the crowd rolled that one in for sure.   
I thought it lipped out for sure, and it just kind of went around then, and so it was awesome.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to the weekend.   Obviously some more low numbers today rather than yesterday.   The conditions probably calmed down a little bit.   Any number in your head going into this weekend?   Obviously last year was kind of a birdie fest.   People were shooting to go low.   Is that an approach that you are going to take super aggressive this weekend?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I'm just going to see how it is the next couple of days.   I think the wind is definitely a big factor out here.   
Just kind of take it hole by hole, day‑by‑day, try to not to look too forward.   Just try to stay in the present really and not get ahead of myself.  
   
 Q.   You are playing hostess this weekend.   I have to ask.   You gave it a plug this week, but tell us the details about you event which is very cool.   How did you get into the thought to do ping pong?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, the background story is that we were at the‑‑ I hosted the HSJGA Tournament of Champions at Grand Wailea.   And two years ago we were out someone's house on Maui and Greg Nichols and I got into this heated ping pong match.   I lost unfortunately.   But it was tight.   
But we were talking about new ways to raise money, didn't want to do the same thing every year.   We're trying to think of something fun, and then we were like what about ping pong.   So it kind of came about and we got a couple of the girls to support the event.   They are going to be out there, and it's going to be one of us and one amateur.   
Happy to say that we got (indiscernible) to be one of the participants as well.   And it's going to be a lot of fun.   Kind of like a boxing arena kind of thing.   I think Mark Rolfing is going to referee the whole match.   
It's going to be a lot of fun.   We'll have a DJ playing.   I think Uncle Bo is having some pupus out there.   It's going to be a lot of fun.   It helps out the Hawaiian State Junior College Scholarship Fund, so that's great.  
   
 Q.   Who is the early favorite?   Who do we look out for that's got their top ping pong game on?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I don't know.   It's hard to tell.   Cristie Kerr is pretty good.   I myself am not horrible.   So I don't know.   I think it will be fun.  
   
 Q.   I have two questions.   First of all, what's the best thing on the menu at Uncle Bo's?   And the second question is Angela shot really great out there today.   Are you having visions of 2009?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I think that everything on the menu is pretty good, but I have to say the six little piggies is my favorites on his menu.   The (indiscernible) pig fried rice is also really good too.   
I'm just so excited.   I love playing with Angela.   We have a great time together.   I'm looking forward to it.   I hope we get to play together tomorrow.
