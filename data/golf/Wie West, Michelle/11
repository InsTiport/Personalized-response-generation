 Q.  Looked like you hurt your hand.  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just got into an uncomfortable position.  Just coming back some shots are going to hurt.  Trying to figure my way around that and just trying to get back in the swing of playing again.   
Obviously disappointed about how I played, but still a lot of positives.  Last couple holes felt good.  Positives going into tomorrow.  Make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  (Regarding not playing tomorrow.)  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's not fun when it does hurt, but I'm going to get physio right now and hopefully they can patch it up a little bit and I'll be good to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  To get back out there, whether or not you played your best game, how did you feel?  
MICHELLE WIE: Feels great to play in front of the home crowd.  No matter how you play you just feel the support; see all the familiar faces; feels really great to be back.  Really grateful that everyone came out and watched me play and excited for tomorrow.   
 Q.  I know tomorrow there will be a little hill to climb.  Think you got a little left in you to make a little magic happen tomorrow?  
MICHELLE WIE: For sure.  Yeah, I'm going to go out there with guns blazing and hopefully make some birdies early on.  Yeah, hopefully a good day tomorrow.
