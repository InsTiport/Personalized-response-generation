   MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, a there was a couple of bounces here and there. You know, I just drove the ball so well today it's a shame that I didn't take advantage with my irons today. 
 But everything else felt pretty solid. Just didn't take advantage of my good drives. It was very frustrating. Overall I hung in there and it was good that I shot an under-par round today.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I feel like I gained a lot of, you know, confidence in myself again this year. It's great being pain-free again. Especially in the early part of the year it was not, you know, not true, but the later part of the year I started feeling really confident. 
 From May on I started, you know, feeling pretty confident about my game. You know, I feel like it's getting better and better. Now in the off-season I know what I need to work on for next year.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know anything about that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHELLE WIE: (Indiscernible.)

 Q. Do you have plans to play in anymore...
 MICHELLE WIE: Not right now.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHELLE WIE: Obviously I did want to, you know, be in top 5. I was playing good off the tee, I just didn't take advantage with my irons. Overall I feel like my game is getting better and better.
