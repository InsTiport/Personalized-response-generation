 Q. How do you feel about your round today? 
 MICHELLE WIE: It was just frustrating. I didn't get any putts in. Probably played pretty solidly. Just couldn't get anything going in. 

 Q. You don't know why? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just a little off here and there. But nothing too bad. Hopefully they will all go in tomorrow. 

 Q. So what will you do tonight? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I will be taking an exam, but we'll see. Just resting I guess.

 Q. What time is the exam? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't know, any time I get back really.

 Q. So it's not like a set time? 
 MICHELLE WIE: No, I don't think so. 

 Q. So anything that you will do for tomorrow a bit more?
 MICHELLE WIE: Practise putting. 

 Q. Your thoughts on a day that didn't turn out as you hoped? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I felt like I hit the ball pretty solid. Just not all the putts went in. Hopefully they will all go in tomorrow.

 Q. You had a 13-hole spell in the middle of the round where you didn't make a birdie; other people were; you could see that on the board. Was that frustrating? How do you deal with that?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it was very frustrating, because I was hitting these shots -- or I had these birdie chances. I had birdie opportunities. I just couldn't take advantage of them today. 
 You know, they were just missing the hole a little bit here and there and it was frustrating. But that's done with and hopefully I can shoot lights-out tomorrow.

 Q. Do you feel like you were mis-reading putts, mis-hiting something, something with your stroke? Will you go and work on it? What's the story?
 MICHELLE WIE: I just wasn't making any. I was a little off here and there, miss-hit a couple, miss-read a couple. Just didn't work out.

 Q. Six shots behind going into the final round. How will you approach it? Will you be more aggressive from get-go? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I think I'll just try to make more birdies and try to make more putts and just from the first hole, try to make birdies.

 Q. Any homework tonight or just relax? 
 MICHELLE WIE: Oh, no, I have to take an exam tonight. But after, I will relax.
