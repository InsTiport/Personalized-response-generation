  Q. Your first win as a member. How did it feel?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It felt great. I mean, I played with Christina today. It was just so exciting. You know, I'm proud of her, I'm proud of our team, and hopefully the final four will motivate everyone else, and I need to go out there and win that second point.  
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about the bond you and Christina had.   
 MICHELLE WIE: We had so much fun out there. We had a lot of fun out there, and that was our goal. We gave it our best.   
  
  Q. Talk about playing two matches today. You're going to go out last this afternoon. The fatigue, the mental pressure, anything?   
 MICHELLE WIE: I'm just so amped up. I'm ready to play, and I'm ready to go out there again. It's just so much fun. I love being in front of that crowd, and it's going to be fun.
