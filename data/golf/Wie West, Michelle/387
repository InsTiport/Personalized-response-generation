PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks for coming in and talking with us, Michelle.

You have finished even par for the tournament.  Another great finish in your third LPGA event this year.  Tell us your feelings about the tournament and we'll take questions after that.
MICHELLE WIE: Well, it was a great week.  I had a lot of fun.  The course is just awesome.  The players were really nice and the fans are just great.  I don't know, I didn't really end on a good note today.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Questions.
Q.  If extended an invitation to come back, would you like to do that a year from now?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, sure.
Q.  Do you think you will feel better the second time around on this course once you get a couple of other practice rounds on it?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, there are parts of the golf course where I thought I could maybe know a little bit more about, but I think I knew pretty much about the golf course this year.  Maybe next year I know more about the course.  I have one tournament under and then hopefully I can play better next year.
Q.  What was the most challenging part about this course?
MICHELLE WIE: I don't know, it's just that you just  -- if you are in the rough in the other tournaments, like in front of the green, there's nothing really so you can just roll it up there.  But you have to just fly it perfectly and you have to be in the fairway, it stresses you being on the fairway.
Q.  What is happening the next few weeks?  Is it Curtis Cup next?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I go back and then I take my finals and then I go to Curtis Cup practice.
Q.  Finals next week?
MICHELLE WIE: Yes.
Q.  How did the crowd size following you this week compare to other crowds that you have played before?
MICHELLE WIE: Certainly really big.  I don't remember, but I think this is like the Top 5 of the crowds.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us through the score card, please.  Birdie 3.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I hit a really good drive.  It was kind of like the first hole but just went a little bit more right than the first day.  I had about 186 to the hole.  I hit about like a 5-iron.  And chip and a putt.  The putt was about six feet.
Q.  How long was your drive there?
MICHELLE WIE: 325 they told me.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Birdie on 8.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I hit a 5-wood off the tee.  I hit I think a 7-iron and then I had about --  I made like a 30-foot putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Bogey on 9.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I hit it a little bit left into the fairway bunker.  I hit a nice shot out of there, just went a little bit right.  I hit 8-iron, then it went to the far right bunker.  I hit a 56 out missed about a 10-foot putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Bogey on 10.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I missed to the right, but I had a pretty good lie.  I had to go over some trees, but I just pulled it a little bit.  I flew off my first chip; then I made a 15-foot putt for bogey.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Bogey on 11.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I kind of pulled to the left.  I thought I hit a really great shot with a 56.  Then I was short and I missed about a 7-foot putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Bogey on 12.
MICHELLE WIE: That one I also kind of hit left.  I hit a 9-iron out of the rough.  I thought it was going to be perfect but it was way short.  I didn't really get out the bunker that well.  I had about a 24-foot putt that I missed for par.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Eagle on 15.
MICHELLE WIE: I had about  -- didn't really hit that good of a drive.  I guess it hit something.  It went really far, but I had about 185 to the hole and I hit a 5-iron.  I made a 3-foot putt for eagle.
PAUL ROVNAK:  18.
MICHELLE WIE: I hit it kind of to the right, my second shot.  I just had a tricky putt and I didn't see -- I mean, I don't know, I was  -- I didn't want to be short and I think I just hit it way too hard.  That uphill really looked uphill to me and the second putt was about seven feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you know how far the first putt was?
MICHELLE WIE: It was off the green.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you putt from off the green?
MICHELLE WIE: Yes.
Q.  You were in position today.  I guess if you had gone out and shot like a 64 or 65 or something you might have been able to contend for the first place.  When you go to the 1st tee in that position do you start have to think low number right away?  You are trying to make something really dramatic happen right from the start of the round?
MICHELLE WIE: I mean, yeah.  I felt like 18 holes wasn't enough.  I mean, I felt like I had to use every shot and just try and shoot the best.  On the first hole I was feeling really good because I had a birdie  -- 4-foot birdie putt.  I missed that one.  I am thinking if I made that putt I think I could have got on a roll.
Q.  How much do you practice?
MICHELLE WIE: In the tournament or   --
Q.  Just when you are not out here?
MICHELLE WIE: Well, I guess I practice a lot.  I practice about three and a half hours everyday.
Q.  When you come back next month for the Public Links, how grueling is that week when you play so many holes of golf in six days?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, 36 holes and 36 holes again.  I mean, it is tiring, but I guess I have to work out a lot more and try and get ready for the summer.
Q.  Last year when you won it how much did that do for your confidence to win a tournament like that?
MICHELLE WIE: I mean, especially winning in a Match Play tournament, it boosts your confidence a lot because every shot is very important and I think that it gave me a lot of confidence.  It was --  actually have something to grab onto.
Q.  Do you think you will step up your training regimen between now and the Publinx next month?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I mean, after I saw how I played this week, I know what I have to work on.
Q.  I mean, your physical training in order to withstand 36 holes a day?
MICHELLE WIE: It's not going to increase a lot.  I am just going to maintain it?
Q.  What is your toughest final ?
MICHELLE WIE: I'd have to say biology.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
MICHELLE WIE: Thank you.
