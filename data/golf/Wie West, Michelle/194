 Q.   So overall you're only four from the lead now.  
MICHELLE WIE:   It's pretty frustrating.   Today was pretty frustrating.   You know, but at least I made birdie on the last hole, made me feel good about myself, but tomorrow I just gotta go out there and really shoot low.  
   
 Q.   Yeah.   You can do that on this course, can't you?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, try to.  
   
 Q.   I mean you still feel you're in the mix.  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, for sure.   A lot can happen tomorrow.   So I just gotta go out there and make some birdies early on, put some pressure, and just keep moving forward.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like the Back 9 you started to step it up.   On the front nine you struggled a little bit.   What was the difference would you say?   Was it putting again?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   That as well.   Obviously I didn't make as many putts as I wanted to.   You know, missed a couple of short ones, but just didn't really ‑‑ gotta get my irons a little closer, give myself more chances.  
   
 Q.   If the wind stays down tomorrow, though, you should be capable of a good day of going quite low?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, you know.   It's a golf course where you can, and you should. So I just gotta go out there tomorrow and gotta focus and make a lot more birdies.
