 Q.   Talk to me about it, what was the scoop of this match today?   
MICHELLE WIE:   We played good, but they played better.   It was one of those matches where birdies won the hole, not par.   
I would birdie, Korda would birdie, and then they would just make everything.   And it's one of those rounds where we both played really well, but they played better.   And as frustrating as it is, there's a lot of good golf today and we just got to get it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel confident as heck though about your game?   That was a big, big putt at 16.   
MICHELLE WIE:   For sure.   I feel I've been playing good.   Like I said, we didn't lose because we played bad, they won.   They played awesome today, they played lights out.   
We just got to bring ‑‑ I just got to bring my A‑plus game tomorrow and just really step it up and get that point.
