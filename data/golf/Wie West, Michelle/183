 Q.   Congratulations, great round today, a great performance.   First Top 10 of the season.   Just take me through this week and how much this felt like your game was back?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Oh, I felt like I won after I made that putt on the last hole.   But I have to say, it feels good to get on the leaderboard and see my name up there consistently this week.   It was a lot of fun.   
I have a lot of positives to take from this week to next week.   I'm very excited to go to Canada and do it all over again.  
   
 Q.   What were the biggest positives you took out of your game this week?   What felt like it came around for you?  
MICHELLE WIE:   I took advantage of the parâ€‘5s.   Just two eagles this week.   I have to say it's more eagles than I've made over the last two years.   
But it was fun out there today.   I was aggressive.   I talked to David yesterday, and just being aggressive out there again and not really caring about the results as much.   It was a lot more fun.  
   
 Q.   You said next week Canada, a place where you've won the event before.   I know it's a different golf course, but the feelings when you go back to a tournament that you've won, what is that feeling like?   
MICHELLE WIE:   It's great when you go back as defending champion.   It's really fun.   I've never been to Vancouver before.   I'm very excited.   I've heard the best about it, so I'm very excited.  
   
 Q.   Everybody saw the blonde hair.   What was the change and what prompted you to make a little switch in the hair?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I don't know.   I get crazy with my hair sometimes.   I don't know it happened last week.   I might go more blonde, I may not.   But I don't know.  
   
 Q.   It looks like the blonde's working out pretty well.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Thanks.
