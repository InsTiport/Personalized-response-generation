Q.   Are you a little disappointed with the round today or was the way you played you got to plus two is about as good as you're going to get?
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, it was an interesting round.   I definitely made some putts, but I definitely lost some shots out there, but you know, the course is playing good today.   Just gotta go out there and hopefully shoot a low number tomorrow, or a red number, I mean and get back into contention.

Q.   Was it ‑‑ the score today, was it more important to strike the ball well or to putt it well?
MICHELLE WIE:   I mean both.   I mean I think it was playing a lot firmer today than it ever was in the practice rounds, especially on the greens, but the conditions are so good.   You just have to hit it right online and the putts will go in.
So just tomorrow I have to keep patient.   The U. S. Open golf courses are not the type where you can make 10 birdies in a row, you know, so you just gotta be patient out there today and just pars are your friends.

Q.   You're two over, so the best score is minus three, so you're within shot.   What is what you're looking at for tomorrow?
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, tomorrow I'm just going to take it shot by shot.   You know, it's a long day out there today, you know.   It took over six hours today, which you know, you have to kind of just play along and think one shot at a time, and I think I did a pretty good job of that today.   So I'm just going to do that tomorrow, just focus on stay in the present on each shot and not really think about the leaderboard too much.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MICHELLE WIE:   It was hot, but I have to say when the sun came down in the end it felt really good.

Q.   Do you know how much water you drank out there?
MICHELLE WIE:   I think a bottle a hole, pretty close to that.
