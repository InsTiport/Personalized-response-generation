  Q. Talk about your round.  
 MICHELLE WIE: Just kind of didn't get a couple of holes going. Just kind of mis-hit a couple of shots and missed a couple putts to day, and I guess that's the difference it makes.  
  
  Q. This is the type of course that Karrie Webb was saying earlier in the week, it's not a matter of hitting the fairway, but the exact right portion of the fairway. Did you come in this week fully prepared for what you're going to expect here?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I heard it was a narrow golf course, so I kind of prepared myself for that. But she's right. You have to be on the right side of the fairway, because there are trees blocking out half of the green, so it's really about management.  
  
  Q. About having played last week, a lot of people come in with a fresh mind. But you had finals. Did that make it tough to prepare?   
 MICHELLE WIE: It was a little bit tough.   
 But I still practiced the same schedule and everything, but it's a fun week so far.
