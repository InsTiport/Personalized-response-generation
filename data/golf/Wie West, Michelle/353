PAUL ROVNAK:  Michelle, Thanks for coming in and speaking with us.  It was a tough day, the conditions, the wind, the rain, maybe you can just start talking about that.
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I've played in rain before.  I've played in the wind before.  I played when it was cold before.  But all put together was really hectic.  It's so hard to get a rhythm out there.  I'm KIND of glad I did this.  It's the first time I played in the British Open and I felt like I got the whole package.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think so.
Q.  Given that, are you pleased with how you finished?
MICHELLE WIE:  I felt like I positioned myself very well, like from the tee to the fairway, but I think that I could have played a little bit    well, not smarter, but better, making more putts and stuff like that.  But, you know, I mean, the way the conditions was today, I guess I played okay, but not really.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  I was just going put on a heater, but the heater didn't really work.  So we were in the car, really shivering, but suddenly the heater worked, but then we had to go outside and it was pretty nice.
Q.  When you came back out, was it windy?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think when I came back out, because when it was raining, I mean, it wasn't really that cold, but when I came out, it was like at least ten degrees colder, but maybe in the car with the heater on it made a difference.  But it was pretty cold out there.

Because living in Hawaii, I don't really experience the cold much.  I think I've played in the cold once in my whole life, maybe twice.  But growing up there, going out there, it's so hard to keep loose.  It was okay.  It wasn't that bad.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, anywhere.  Well, this year at Safeway, I had like a 7:00 tee time and it was like 50 degrees.  I think that's the coldest I've ever been.  You calculate the rain and the wind today, I think I've never been this cold before.
Q.  How did you find the links golf course?  Did you like it?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I do.  The when we played the Curtis Cup the weather was actually pretty nice.  But when the wind and the rain starts flying like this, the golf course becomes really different.  It's really exciting.  It was really a new experience for me.  It was really nice.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, definitely, I don't think that I'm that far behind with the conditions being like this.  But I have three more days to go, and you know, we're not finished yet.
Q.  Are you surprised to see scores like 69?
MICHELLE WIE:  A little bit, but the players are so good now.  It's not really surprising in a way.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I think I just tried to hit it too hard and the club slipped a little.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Not really, I don't feel it.
Q.  Where exactly were you on 11?
MICHELLE WIE:  I was in the pot bunker.  That was extra special.
Q.  From the tee or green side bunker?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, off the tee, I was in the fairway.

Yeah, I actually was just in front of the green.
Q.  You 3 putted the ninth.  Did you have any other 3 putts?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yes, I did, the 13th hole.
Q.  Inaudible?
MICHELLE WIE:  Oh, yeah.  I hit it in the fairway there and I had about like 150, and then, I don't know, I think I hit a 7 iron and then I just started out a little right and the wind just completely took it, completely took it right.  So I was in the rough on the right and I chipped on to the green.  It was a little bit long, like about 15 feet and I missed that.

The par 5, I hit a good drive there and I hit a 4 iron on to the green, like a 20 foot putt.

9, the 3 putt, it was really long, like about 60 feet.
Q.  The first putt really took off.
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I know.
Q.  11, bunker from the tee?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, and then I hit it just right of the green.  And I thought the greens would be kind of soft because the green flooded over, but it wasn't really soft.  It was actually really hard.  So I hit my cheap and it was about nine feet long and I missed that.
Q.  You birdied 12, the par 3.
MICHELLE WIE:  I hit an 8 iron there.  I made a long putt.  I think I made like a 13 yard putt.

Then I hit into the left rough.  I kind of really pulled a driver and I just had to lay up from there.  I had about like 100 yards and the wind just picked up again and then I was way short.  It was a horrible shot.  I had about like a 15 yard putt.
Q.  You parred in after that?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah.
Q.  After you hit your second shot on 18?
MICHELLE WIE:  I hit a 1 iron, the hybrid 1 iron, 220.
Q.  You had chances on the par 5s?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, basically the last four holes, I could have made birdie.  I just missed a lot of crucial putts out there today.
Q.  How many drivers did you hit?
MICHELLE WIE:  No, I can't remember.  I can't remember it.  I don't even remember the holes, can you expect me to remember how many drivers I hit?  (Laughing.)  I don't know, I have no idea.
