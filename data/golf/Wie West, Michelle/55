Q. Michelle Wie, 6-under round today.  What was the key to the strong play?
MICHELLE WIE: You know, I just stuck it in there close today.  I was kind of frustrated after my first round.  Couldn't get my wedges in close at all, so I spent a lot of time on the range afterwards just working on my wedge game.
You know, I'm glad it paid off today.  I hit it a lot closer today, which felt good.
Q. Looking like another top 10 finish.  Strong season.  How much momentum does this give you going forward?
MICHELLE WIE: So much.  Definitely after a missed cut last week you always have things creeping up in your head giving you a little bit of doubt.
But, you know, it felt good today to go out there and crush all of it and keep building momentum.
Q. What's the game plan for the next couple weeks?
MICHELLE WIE: I am going to take off next week.  I'm still regaining my health back.  Try to get back to 100%.
So hopefully get a good week off and get really ready for the summer.
Q. Finally, with the top 10 finish some more Solheim points?  What would that mean for you, to play your way onto the team?
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, for sure.  I'm stalking the list for sure.  I'm trying to get as many points as I can and trying to get up there and make the team.
