Q.  No one has made a birdie on 18 all day.
 MICHELLE WIE:  I put myself in really good position.  I hit it right where I wanted to.  I thought the putt was going in, but I guess save it for today.
Q.  You have got to be pleased with 69.
 MICHELLE WIE:  I am.  I was shooting for consistent under par round.  I had 1-under par round so far.  I have a long way to go.  Hopefully a lot more birdies, a lot less bogeys.
MICHELLE WIE:  I could but that's not the smart play.  Just got to play smart today.
Q.  Looks like you're reading the putts with (inaudible)
 MICHELLE WIE:  I am getting better at it.  Getting my feel.  David worked with me a lot and hopefully I will hole a lot more putts.
Q.  Are you having fun?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I am having a lot of fun.
Q.  What did you take off the tee at 18?
MICHELLE WIE:  A driver.
Q.  What did you hit in?
MICHELLE WIE:  6-iron.
Q.  Did it help that the greens are maybe a little softer because of the rain yesterday?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yes.  Definitely on 18 it helped.
Q.  Plan on hitting driver all week on 18?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know.  If it dries out it might be too long, so, we'll see.
Q.  Is it a benefit having played three or four holes now?
MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely.  I think so.  I mean, it's better this way, I think.
Q.  How was it sleeping?
 MICHELLE WIE:  Sleeping?  I woke up at 4:15 this morning (laughs).

So that was a little different.
