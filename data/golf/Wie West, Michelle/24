Q. What a bounce back from Michelle Wie.  You told us yesterday you were seeing multiple golf balls out there.  Your doctor said it was viral and an inner-ear thing.  How was your stamina, because I know you were struggling to start?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  I definitely saw one golf ball today, which was good.  I just sat down every chance I could.  My caddie helped me a lot out there, just getting all the numbers.  I asked him to read every putt for me because I just couldn't see everything.  But I'm excited to -- I'm just going to go see the doctor right now and just rest for the afternoon.
Q. When you're not feeling well and you're not playing well and you get that boost of energy from the crowd, how much does that lift you up even when you're not wanting to do it yourself?
MICHELLE WIE: Oh, for sure.  My caddie does a great job of keeping me going.  It's like, come on, one more shot, one more shot.  It's really great when the fans kind of keep you going as well too.  They definitely give you energy out there.
Q. You battled back nicely out there, Michelle.  First of all, you looked like you were maybe feeling dizzy or not feeling well on the front nine?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I just definitely was not feeling that great.  I just talked to the doctor last night, and he said it's definitely some kind of ear virus thing, and definitely having a little bit of vertigo going.  So feeling a lot better today than I did yesterday, just definitely have a lot less energy.
So I'm glad I have this entire afternoon to do nothing and sleep and try to get me back to a hundred percent for the weekend.
Q. Did it help going into today knowing what you were up against so you could pace yourself from the beginning, where yesterday it maybe catches you by surprise?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  Yesterday I wasn't prepared for it at all.  I felt good, felt good on the range, and all of a sudden I started seeing multiple golf balls, and that scared me a little bit.
But today I woke up feeling dizzy.  I knew exactly what I was getting into.  I just knew I couldn't make any sudden motions, walk slowly.  My caddie did a great job of what to do out there and just kept me going, and I got some good numbers.  I asked him to read every putt because I was like I don't trust my eyes right now.  So he did a great job reading the greens.
Q. You got on a nice little run there on the back nine.  Where did you kind of get that fire when not feeling well to make that run?
MICHELLE WIE: I think that's the confidence kind of getting me through.  Just knowing that I can.  Like yesterday, even the score didn't show it, on the back nine I felt really solid and I felt like I was playing really well.  So I think I set myself up nicely for the weekend.  I'm just excited to play the weekend, honestly and live to play another day.
