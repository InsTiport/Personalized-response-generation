Q.   (No Microphone.)
MICHELLE WIE:   I love my team.   I wish we did better.   We have two years to get ready for Germany and we're going to get that cup back. 

Q.   Tough fought match for you, I know it came right down to the end, I know it wasn't how you wanted to finish, but can you be proud of how you played this week?
MICHELLE WIE:   She birdied the last hole to win.   There's nothing really I can do about that.   I played my heart out today.   And that's what happens.   There's nothing more I can ask for.   I hung in there, I stuck it out, I played tough.   And they played great this week.   And there's nothing you can do about that.

Q.   Just, I know it's always hard when you lose, but just the way this team, you saw some of the rookies step up, play well, what do you guys say about the future heading into the next two years?
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, I'm really excited for Germany.   I've never seen such chemistry on a team before.   And I think it's just going to make us stronger for sure.
