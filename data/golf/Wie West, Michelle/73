Q. You got off to a shaky start and then recovered pretty well.  What was working out there for you this afternoon?
MICHELLE WIE: Just hit some bad shots on the 1st and 2nd hole, which you can't really do.  I played well the rest of the day.  Just needed to post a really low score, which I wasn't able to, which is obviously very disappointing.
But, you know, I'll come back next year (indiscernible.)
Q. Differences between today's round and yesterday's round?  A lot smoother today.
MICHELLE WIE: It was less windy today.  Just yesterday was one of those days where ball striking wasn't the best.  When that happens in that much wind, everything gets exaggerated so much more.
The wind just got the best of me.  Today I played a little bit better.  There was less wind.  Tried to get something going today, and unfortunately I jus couldn't.
Q. I think it's always disappointing to shoot a higher score, but to shoot the way you did today and look back on what happened yesterday, does that make it even a little bit more bitter?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just disappointing for sure.  I wanted to play well this week.  Just coming out here and not having a good performance, just definitely is disappointing.  Take the weekend to practice and get ready for the next event.
