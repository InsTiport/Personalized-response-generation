Q. Really nice round today.  What was working out there for you?
MICHELLE WIE: Just tried to just judge the distance out of the rough a lot better and stay patient today.
Putting felt a lot better today too, so hopefully tomorrow keep it going and make some more birdies.
Q. Beautiful approach shot on 18.  Can you take us through that shot?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, the wind changed all of a sudden on 11, and it was straight into the wind on 18.  Decided to hit a little 11-wood and worked out nicely.
Q. 69 today; your low round of the week so far.  We've been talking about the conditions and how they've changed a little bit from our coverage yesterday.  Did they change during the day for you?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  Started off with a normal tradewinds, and all of a sudden I made the turn and it was straight downwind and it was like really weird.
(Wind interference --  regarding par-5.)
Q. What's the normal breeze at this time of the year?
MICHELLE WIE: Should be normal tradewinds.  Should be into off the left on 1, and then should be downwind on 18, but I played it straight.
Q. Quick check about injuries.  We saw your leg very taped up, your right leg.  How are you feeling?  Is everything okay?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, everything is fine.  I don't know why my tape jobs just get really aggressive really quickly.
But I'm feeling good.
Q. How comfortable are you on the golf course? (Indiscernible.)
MICHELLE WIE: I'm just having fun with it.  I think I'm treating golf more like a game.  I'm trying not to grind as much and treat it like a game.
Just go out there and having fun and kind of reading putts that way as well.  Just having a lot of fun playing.
Q. (No microphone.)
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I know.
