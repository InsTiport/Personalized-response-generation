 Q. Talk about the final round.MICHELLE WIE: It was fun.  It's all a blur right now, but it was fun.
Q. I have to ask you one quick question.  Your strategy for the day was probably played out.  Keep it simple, no mistakes.MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I spent a lot of time before I came out today, probably like an hour and a half in my room just planning everything.  I think my caddie and I, we did a really good job.  We just stayed below the pin, didn't really leave myself in a really difficult position today, except for 16, obviously.  With you, but, he I can't, you think I did a pretty good job of that.
Q. 16 was a hiccup and you emerged from that without serious damage.  How did you keep your self composed through all that?MICHELLE WIE: Well, I just, stuff happens like that.  It's a U.S. Open, I just wanted to just kind of keep my calm.
