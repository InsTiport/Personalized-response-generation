 Q.  How do you feel?  
MICHELLE WIE: Great.  Just very happy with how I finished today, birdieing the last two holes.  I had a lot of fun this week, a lot of positive for the rest of the year.  Hopefully just keep building on my confidence.  I'm happy.   
 Q.  Did you hear the news this afternoon about Lexi?  
MICHELLE WIE: I did.  A rules official came to us on the 18th hole.   
 Q.  What do you think of that?  
MICHELLE WIE: I don't know the situation enough.  I just heard what sort of happened.  But, you know, my heart kind of dropped for her.  That's something you never want to hear during a round.  You know, I feel for her.   
 Q.  Do you think that viewers should be allowed to call in?  
MICHELLE WIE: I mean, I've got DQ'd plenty of times for that (laughing).  At least she didn't get DQ'd.   
 Q.  So Lexi just got assessed a four-stroke penalty.  Any reaction to that?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I don't know much about that.  But a rules official came up to us on the 18th tee, and it's really unfortunate.  My heart definitely dropped.  Just that's something that that's probably the last thing you want to hear during a round, especially when you have a lead.  But at least she didn't get DQ'd (laughing).  I definitely got DQ'd a couple of times.   
 Q.  Obviously coming from personal experience, how do you think she'll maybe change or move on from this?  
MICHELLE WIE: I don't know.  It's a sticky situation.  It's unfortunate.  You know, I really feel for her.  It's just I hope she birdies, makes four birdies and makes up for it.  You know, it's a hard situation.  I wish her the best.
