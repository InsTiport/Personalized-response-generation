Q. 5-under round today.  What was the key to your strong play?
MICHELLE WIE: I just had fun out there today.  I love playing with Marina, she's a really good friend of mine and she was playing great today, and just kind of feeding off each other's energy.
Q. Your game has been in pretty good shape these last couple weeks.  What did you work on before heading to Asia?
MICHELLE WIE: Just really just kept my body right.  Just really took time off and really tried to get healthy again.  I did a lot of rehab and just practiced and tried to play a lot.
Q. What's the keys going into the rest of the tournament?  Obviously hot temperatures out here and all that?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, just definitely rest a lot, get the fluids up and just want to keep having fun.
