Q. 2-over your round today.
MICHELLE WIE: I played good.  I just felt like I just miss-read every single putt.  It was one of those days where I hit every dang one of them perfect and just misread the speed and misjudged the speed a little bit.  Had a lot of lipouts.  If those would have just fell in, it would have been a completely different story.
But I'm proud of the way I'm playing and I'm proud of the birdie I made on the last hole.
Q. Nine straight pars.  Seemed like you were hitting the ball great.  How did you stay patient?
MICHELLE WIE: I hit the putts perfectly.  Some days, you just don't read them right.  It was just one of those days.  Unfortunately I just didn't play that well coming in.  But I'm proud of myself for hanging in there and still sneaking in the Top-20.
Q. What's your outlook for the next major?
MICHELLE WIE: I definitely know what I need to work on for next week, and I'm really excited for the U.S. Open.  So I'm really pumped for that.
