 Q.   How were conditions today?   
    MICHELLE WIE:   It was a little more difficult than yesterday.   This golf course, it can get you on a hole.   I had two double‑bogeys today which were‑‑ you know, it's very frustrating, but at the same time, this course can do this to you.   So you just have to keep your head on straight and just keep going.   
   
 Q.   How mentally tough is it, you have the four birdies in a row and the double‑bogeys, how tough to stayin those fluctuations?  
    MICHELLE WIE:   It was a very up‑and‑down day, but at the same time I'm very proud of myself forgetting those four birdies in a row.   
    It was tough out there.   It was really tough out there today.   And I just got a little bit unlucky on the last hole.   I know I played well today, so just got to go out there and just do the same thing tomorrow and hopefully not get into the fescue.  
   
 Q.   Was the wind the problem today, or the greens‑‑ what was biggest issue?   
    MICHELLE WIE:   The wind was quite strong today.   You know, a couple of them, it was pretty hard.   Like 8, even if I didn't hit it into the right hazard, it's impossible to stop that green.   
    So a couple of them, you know, it was just the wind was very tricky today.   It's a heavy wind, as well, but I think that's the beauty of this golf course.   I think it's nice when it plays this hard and I think it's a great golf course.  
   
 Q.   Just to be able to get yourself on that kind of streak, in our birdies in a row, how nice was that to get the confidence rolling and feel that kind of streak that has not always been there?  
    MICHELLE WIE:   It felt good, it felt really good.   It was a stretch of really tough holes.   I hit some really good shots and made some really good putts.   That's the way I need to play all day tomorrow.
