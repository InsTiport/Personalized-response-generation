  MICHELLE WIE:   I tapped in and I missed, and I that didn't feel too good either.   But other than that, a really solid round.  
   
 Q.   In terms of your season in general, a bit more struggle compared to while you were in school.   What is your thought on the season in general?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Just haven't been playing well this year, but it's always a work in progress.   I've been trying to take a lot of positives from it.   
You know, felt good last week and for the remainder of the season, I'm just going to keep my head up and try to play well.
