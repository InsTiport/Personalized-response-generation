 Q.  Tell us the story of your day.  MICHELLE WIE: It went pretty well.  I'm pretty happy with how my round went, a lot better than yesterday.  Kind of felt good that I kind of fixed what went wrong yesterday.  I hit a lot more fairways today and my irons were a little bit sharper than yesterday.  I just have to keep on improving what I improved on today.   Q.  What adjustments did make on the range?  MICHELLE WIE: Just a couple here and there, nothing major.  Focusing on my center of balance, keeping that right, just trying to keep my balance good.   Q.  Walking up the hills?  MICHELLE WIE: Sometimes it's not too fun, but I'm hanging in there.   Q.  A lot of players are commenting on how slow the greens are, how did you make the adjustment to the green speed?  MICHELLE WIE: Despite all the rain we got yesterday, they were in good condition.  It felt pretty good today.  Obviously in the afternoon the grass does grow a little bit more.  But it's slopey, as it is.  I didn't really notice too much of a difference.   Q.  Based on what you've played out here and what you've seen, what kind of a game is it going to take for somebody to win?  MICHELLE WIE: I think the key is to hit the fairways.  The key is to hit the greens and not be stuck in the wrong parts of the greens.  If you just play smart out here, I think birdies are out there.  But you just have to be patient out here because there are some holes where if you don't hit it in the fairway, you have to make a good par-putt here and there.   Q.  How physically demanding are the next two days going to be for you?  MICHELLE WIE: You know, I'm just going to take it easy tonight, hopefully play a little bit later tomorrow so I'll have time to rest.  But it is a little bit tough.  But tape it up, brace it up and good to go.
