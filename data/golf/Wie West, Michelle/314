   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  (Recording started) Are you optimistic from here on out once your wrist does heal? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, you know it felt good when was practicing but, you know, I kind of like tweaked it in the middle of round a little bit. 
 So just taking caution measures, and I know what to work on.  The only way to go up from here is up, so I'm feeling pretty good about it. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  And it was the wrist injury, the wrist injury and is what forced the WD? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Yes. 

 Q.  Is it too early to determine what your immediate future is as far as next week, the LPGA and then the Open? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I'm definitely going take it into account and think did about it.  The last thing I want to do is not play next week.  I'm really excited to get back into the game and play in tournaments again. 
 I'm going reanalyze it and kind of try to be smart about it.  But I definitely want to play next week.  I definitely know what to work on, so I'm excited to get back into it and try to work on it. 

 Q.  Your tee shots, some were missing to the left and some were missing to the right.  What are you going to be working on?  What was going wrong for you out there? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, I think that when an injury is in the back of your mind, you're thinking, Oh, this is going to hurt.  The last thing you're thinking about is trying to hit the ball straight. 
 Just very unfortunate, but I definitely know what to work on.  I don't really want to talk about it now because I haven't really thought about it. 
 I'm definitely want to work on a lot of things, and it's definitely going to be better for next week. 

 Q.  Could you tell us what happened on that Par 5 where you took the 10? 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, it's just very unfortunate hole.  It kind of went right and then it hit a car, I think, and then kind of bounced back in.  But unfortunately rolled down a drain so it was OB.  So it was unfortunate. 
 It was actually quite funny.  I was going crawl down the drain and prove that it was in bounds, but I couldn't fit I into that drain so I couldn't do that. 
 But unfortunately I kind of pulled my shot left and then it's all a blur.  It's a bad hole, you know, and everyone has bad holes.  I'm just going to work on it and get better. 

 Q.  Can you talk about the Par 3, No. 14, where you hit it to the right, and just take us through that sequence of events.  I know that your dad said something to you and then Janice Moody approached your father.  I'm just wondering what all happened and what he said. 
 MICHELLE WIE:  I don't know.  It's a long way back.  I hit the tee shot, it went right.  I went back to the tee, hit it right again, took a drop, hit a shot, and made 2-putt and left. 
 You know, I mean, there's really nothing else, I don't think, I mean... 

 Q.  Just a follow-up.  Can you talk about your decision -- first you were going to declare an unplayable and then you changed your mind and decided to go back to the tee. 
 MICHELLE WIE:  Well, that's one of the options.  I had an option to take a two-club length or an option to go back to the tee, and I just felt like from there it was a really hard shot and I still feel comfortable with my tee shots so I decided to go back to the tee. 
 But I definitely did take an unplayable there, and I felt like I did the right thing. 

 Q.  Are you aware of the 88 rule, and did it have any affect -- you were awfully close to shooting that 88 and being DQd for the rest of the year. 
 MICHELLE WIE:  That's the farthest thing away from me thinking about it.  I don't think about shooting 88.  That's not what I do.  I try to play the best golf I can, and unfortunately I was not able to do that because I had issues with my wrist. 
 You know, shooting 88 is not what I think about, and from now on I'm going think about hitting fairways and hitting good shots and having fun out there.
