  Q. What was the one best thing you did today?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Well, I think I could have gotten a lot worse on the front nine, but you know, I think I made a lot of good up-and-downs, and I kind of kept it together on the back nine. I had a lot of birdie opportunities.   
 But it's a tough golf course, and tomorrow hopefully in the morning I can go to another round.  
  
  Q. You look totally different than last week the way -- just the way everything was going with your game and the way the course was. You weren't getting any action on the ball.   
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, just a couple of missed shots here and the rough is really penal.  
  
  Q. Is that why you couldn't get anything on the ball because you were in the rough early so much, especially?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I was trying to get things going. Just my first nine didn't really go the way I wanted to, but like I said, it could have gotten a lot worse. So I did a lot of damage control today, so hopefully tomorrow I'll do a lot better.  
  
  Q. What's the first thing you're going to practice right now?  
 MICHELLE WIE: Usually I always practice putting first when I go to the range, so same deal.  
  
  Q. Is your hand low now, left hand low?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It's been like that for a long time.  
  
  Q. I thought maybe you made a change.   
 MICHELLE WIE: No.   
  
  Q. Good luck tomorrow.
