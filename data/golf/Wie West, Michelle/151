Q.   How was your golf today? 
MICHELLE WIE:   It was good.   It's hot today but I hung in there today.   But I'm glad to be in under par today.

Q.   How are course conditions? 
MICHELLE WIE:   It's good.   They moved a couple of tees up but it's still a difficult golf course, so I would take any red number out here.
It was tough on a couple holes, easier on some. 

Q.   And how was your shots and putting? 
MICHELLE WIE:   It was good.   My irons were a little bit better during the end but everything was pretty solid.

Q.   How was this year's HSBC? 
MICHELLE WIE:   You know, I love coming to this event.   I think they do such a good job of treating us well.   I love Singapore.   I love coming back here every year and I can't wait till next year. 

Q.   After this tournament, please tell me your schedule to play. 
MICHELLE WIE:   I'm going to go back home and then play Phoenix and the whole West Coast Swing. 

Q.   LPGA Tour? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Yes. 

Q.   Kraft Nabisco is one of five major championships.   What does this tournament mean to you? 
MICHELLE WIE:   It's one of the most important tournaments to me.   I've always really enjoyed it, has a lot of history to me and I'm really looking forward to it.

Q.   How do you prep? 
MICHELLE WIE:   Hopefully well. 

Q.   First major, how do you feel?

Q.   What is your goal for this championship?
MICHELLE WIE:   I just want to go out there and just really focus on one shot.   It's been a long four days out there.   I'm just going to go out there and enjoy myself and really take it shot by shot.
