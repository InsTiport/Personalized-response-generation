 Q.   What a way to get things going here at the Kraft Nabisco Championship.   How rewarding is it to open up with 5‑under 67?   
MICHELLE WIE:   It feels good.   On a golf course like this, shooting 5‑under is a good score, so I'm really happy.  
   
 Q.   We spoke earlier in the week, and some of your keys you kept saying tempo, tempo, tempo; how were you able to implement that throughout the course of the day?   
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, that's really what we worked on the range before and what I thought about all throughout my round, and I think I did a pretty good job today.  
   
 Q.   You had a great stretch in there, birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie, 5‑under through four.   What does that do when you jump start a round and run with it?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I didn't get anything going in the beginning, and then I had a birdie and I just kept things going.   I just felt really good.  
   
 Q.   Lot of golf still left, but how do you keep it going and a quick turnaround to Friday morning?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I'm going to go back, eat some dinner, get an early rest and get back into it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Just generalize how you felt out there today.   What went well for you today?   
MICHELLE WIE:   I felt comfortable.   I felt comfortable out there.   I felt like I was aggressive on the holes I need to be aggressive on and just conservative on the holes that I knew I just needed to make par.
