 Q. How do you feel about your game?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think it's going in the right direction and just try to keep getting better.

 Q. What are some of the adjustments you need to make?
 MICHELLE WIE: I think just from the off-season, I've been trying too hard to work on things and I have to change into tournament mode, which I haven't been doing. I feel like I've just been thinking too much and today I just went out there and just tried to play and hopefully from now on, I'll just keep on doing that.

 Q. What was the highlight of your day today? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I have to say it had to have been when I hit it out of the bush and I hit it straight into the bush and it went out. 

 Q. How about hole No. 9, is that fast becoming your favourite hole, three birdies in a row?
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, let's not jinx it, but it's a good hole. 

 Q. Last year Jiyai was six strokes behind, still managed to win. Pretty tight leaderboard out there; what is your outlook for tomorrow?
 MICHELLE WIE: Same thing I did today. Like I said, just go out there and try to have fun and try to make some birdies. 

 Q. Lots of fans came out to much what you today, are you surprised by how well-loved you are in Singapore?
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm surprised this many people and I'm just so grateful for the fan base. The fans were awesome today.
