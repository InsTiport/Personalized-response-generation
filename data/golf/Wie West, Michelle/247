  Q. Are you happy with the result?   
 MICHELLE WIE: It was a little frustrating today trying to make birdies, but hopefully tomorrow make some more.   
  
  Q. Will there be any difference in your approach to tomorrow's round?  
 MICHELLE WIE: No, same thing. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots out there. Just need to make a couple more putts and keep hitting my irons good. Just got to keep it in play.   
  
  Q. What is your take on the course?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's a tricky course.   
 It's not the easiest one, and it's a good competition golf course.   
  
  Q. What happened on the last?  
 MICHELLE WIE: I hit the drive and then kind of failed on my irons and then I just couldn't get up-and-down.   
  
  Q. What did you think about all of your fans?   
 MICHELLE WIE: It's great. I'm just so grateful to have such a fan base, and they are awesome out there.
