Q. Just thoughts on the match overall and how tough it was playing against those two?
MICHELLE WIE: They played great.  I think they made one bogey, I think, today.  They played really good, putted great.  We played good as well.  Obviously not as good.  And we definitely are bummed.  But we put up a good fight.  And there's still matches to go play.  So hopefully we'll play well.
Q. How have you feeling now after playing three matches?  Feel good still?
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, after that I'm kind of bummed out.  But everything is -- we played pretty good and then we just missed here and there.  But they just played really well.  So there's not much really --
Q. Does that fire you guys up to get back out on the course?
DANIELLE KANG: Of course.  I think I'm out for the rest of the day, though.  I don't know yet.
MICHELLE WIE: I could be too.  I don't know yet.
DANIELLE KANG: We don't know.
MICHELLE WIE: Are the pairings out?
Q. I think they just came out?
DANIELLE KANG: Where are they?
Q. I don't know?
DANIELLE KANG: I'm not sure what the pairings are.  But, yeah, definitely fired up, either playing this afternoon or tomorrow, either or.
