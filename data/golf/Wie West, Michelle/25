Q. What was the challenge today for you?
MICHELLE WIE: I had the mad spins out there, that was for one.  I just got really dizzy.  I don't know why or how.  I don't know.  But it was interesting.  I fouled five balls out there on the front nine.  One that I whiffed in the rough, I think I hit the rough on that.  Pick and choose today.
Q. Have you ever had that happen before?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I think it's just altitude sickness from my height maybe (laughing).  No, I just sometimes get it from time to time.  I don't know.  It just came about today.  I was thinking maybe because it's hot and whatnot.
But back nine I felt a lot better.  I'm hoping that get a good night's sleep tonight and make a lot of birdies.
Q. How do you sort of mentally overcome that when there is nothing you can really do when you feel like that?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's tough.  I grinded through there today.  It's just I got a couple holes there on the front nine there was really nothing I could do.  My caddie did great.  Just kept giving me water, just try to drink as much as I can, try to sit as much as I can.  So, just trying to keep my energy levels up.
