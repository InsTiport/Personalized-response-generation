Q. Tell us the story of your day.
MICHELLE WIE: Missed a couple of putts.  You know, just felt like I played -- could have played a lot lower.  Just missed a lot of opportunities out there.  But overall for the first day, I feel like I came back strong, so I'm happy about that.
Q. 16, 17 and 18, you went par, par, birdie, a lot of hype about the gauntlet and how it played.  How did it play today, especially with the softer conditions?
MICHELLE WIE: It's great finishing holes.  I think 16, 17 and 18 are tough.  I think they're pretty cool.  They're pretty cool finishing holes.
Q. 12, 13 and 14, what happened on those holes?  What was the difference after that?
MICHELLE WIE: You know, I just was behind a tree on 12.  13 I three-putted, so it was just nothing really spectacular.
