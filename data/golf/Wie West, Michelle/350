PAUL ROVNAK:  Michelle, thanks for coming in and joining us, another round under par today, 7 under for the tournament.  If you go low, you have a great shot tomorrow.  Just talk about that.
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, you know, I still feel like I have a chance tomorrow, if I get things going tomorrow hopefully I'll be able to do that.
Q.  Can you compare today to yesterday?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, obviously I didn't play as well as I did yesterday.  Today I just really couldn't get things going.

But I still feel good about my game.  I still feel confident and I'll be ready for tomorrow.
Q.  Is there one element of your game today that held you back?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think that, you know, the couple of bad shots here and there that, you know, kept me from going lower.  But you know, it's just one of those days where one bad shot can cost you a stroke here and there.  I hope tomorrow that even if I don't hit a good shot, I'll still make pars and I'll keep things going tomorrow.
Q.  You made some nice putts but some others it looked like maybe judging the speed of the putts was not your strong suit today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, you know, yesterday I felt like I judged my speed very well.  Today it was a little bit off a little bit.  You know, hopefully for tomorrow I think that I can do good on that.
Q.  What do you think you have to shoot tomorrow to put yourself in contention?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, it will just be a low number.  I'll just think about one shot at a time.  If I get things going, then I get things going.  But, you know, if it happens one way or another, I'll just focus hole by hole tomorrow.
Q.  Is there any one or two things that you wish you did differently today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, there was a couple of drives.  There's a couple of putts that I wish I made, a couple of wedge shots that I wish were closer.  I have some shots I wish were better.  You know, it's just what happened and today is over with and I'm just going to think about tomorrow.
Q.  Can you talk about what happened on hole No. 5?  It looked like you hit or ground
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, the brown under was under repair and I wondered what my options were, see if you can go right or something like that.  But I was better off just playing there.  It wasn't like it was a horrible lie or anything, so I was very fortunate.
Q.  And can you tell us which irons you hit on the par 3s?
MICHELLE WIE:  I'm not really sure.  I think I hit 9 iron on 8, and I hit a 5 iron, a three quarter 5 iron on the other par 3 on the front nine and I hit a 7 iron, a three quarter shot on 12, and I hit I think it was a 6 iron on the other one.
Q.  When you played with people that have won tournaments in the past and on the last day, what did you learn from being around them?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, you know, when I play in like LPGA tournaments, when I play with really experienced LPGA players, I learn a lot from them.  They have a lot of experience and obviously they are very talented and you just learn from watching them.  I can't really say it really specifically right now, but you know, basically it's like not wasting shots, making putts when you need to, and I think that's very important.
Q.  You have a string of outstanding approach shots on 5, 6 and 7.  Did you hit driver on all those holes?  Did you switch to hitting driver more later in the round?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think the course is set up that way.  I don't really choose, just worked out that way on the front nine.
Q.  It looked like you hit more drivers today than yesterday.
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't think so, I don't know.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You started on the back side, you birdied 13.
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, I hit driver there and kind of pulled it left in the rough.  Then I hit a 6 iron, laid up to about 75 yards.  Got it to about four feet.

16, I hit a 6 iron off the tee.  I kind of had    it was an okay chip.  It was a little bit longer.  It was kind of a difficult downhill putt, so that was about four feet and I missed it.

1, I hit a driver on that hole and then I hit a 5 wood and went a little left.  I chipped it to about like three feet.

2, I hit my 3 wood left.  Then I got it on to the green but it was on the lower level and it was about like 50 feet.

3, I hit a driver down there, had about like 55 yards with a lob wedge to about four feet.

5, I hit my driver down there, hit a 5 iron on to the green and 2 putt from like 25 feet.

Next, hit a driver down there and had like 100 yard with a gap wedge to about four feet.

9, I hit the driver right into the bunker.  It was kind of close to the lip and I couldn't hit it like I wanted to, I hit a 5 iron that was short and I hit it long.  My par putt was like about 18 feet.
Q.  Is there one putt that you missed that you were close on that's going to stick with you for a while today?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't think so.  All of the putts that I had today were unfortunately very tricky.  I felt like I putted very well.  I had a good stroke, I felt confident out there hopefully I can carry that on tomorrow.
Q.  How worried should the leaders be about you lurking back there tomorrow?
MICHELLE WIE:  I don't think they are thinking about me.  You know, we are just trying to play our best.
Q.  There was a guy on the third hole that approached you, was he asking for an autograph or what was that about?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think so.  I think he's staying in one of those townhouses behind the sign, I don't know.
Q.  What's the lowest score you've shot here?
MICHELLE WIE:  I'm not really sure.  I don't remember.  I don't really keep score.  (Laughing).
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you, Michelle.
