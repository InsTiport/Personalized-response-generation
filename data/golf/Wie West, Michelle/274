   MIKE SCANLAN: Nice way to start, 4-under par on Saturday, moving day, and obviously you've moved into a tie for fourth, and you're in the hunt for your first LPGA Tour victory. Just talk about your day today. 
 MICHELLE WIE: I felt pretty good about it. It just didn't make a lot of putts, so I just have to work on a couple more things for tomorrow. 
 You know, I was pleased with the way I hit it and hopefully play better tomorrow. 

 Q. Would you talk about what you have to do in your mind; do you have to go low? 
 MICHELLE WIE: I think my game plan is going to stay the same as it's been the last three days. Just going to go out there and hit each shot with confidence and try my hardest every day and see where it takes me. 

 Q. Your putting, in the last few days --
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I'm a pretty good putter, just want to send the ball home. But it will go home tomorrow; I'll make it. 

 Q. Is this as good as you've hit the ball since the opening tournament in Hawaii?
 MICHELLE WIE: I'm not really sure about that. You know, I don't really assess my game like that. I think it's just that I go out there and I just try to play as hard as I can, and you know, I'm feeling pretty solidly about my game. 
 So working on a couple more things on the range and on the green and hopefully I'll be better tomorrow. 

 Q. Let me rephrase that, then; is this as good as you felt about your game since the first tournament?
 MICHELLE WIE: I don't want to say -- I don't want to really answer that. Like I said, I feel pretty pleased about how I'm hitting it, but you know, it would be great if it was better tomorrow. 

 Q. Obviously you're within pretty good striking distance tomorrow. Do you dream about a first win on this tour, and what would it mean to you?
 MICHELLE WIE: It would mean a lot. I always think about it, you know, how -- that old Nationwide Tour commercial with the guy holding the little creamer thing, that's basically how I feel. I'm just basically going to go out there and try my hardest and have fun like I had the last few it days and see where it takes me. 

 Q. Is it tougher coming from behind or being in the lead? 
 MICHELLE WIE: You know, I don't know really. I think it's hard both ways. 

 Q. Do you watch the scoreboard on the final day? 
 MICHELLE WIE: A little bit but I don't try to look too much. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you very much.
