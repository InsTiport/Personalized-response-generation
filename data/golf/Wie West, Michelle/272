   MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, you know, it was tough out there. The wind was strong. You know, it was a tough day. I felt like I played fairly solid. I was proud of the fact that I was patient today. Made a couple of iron shots in there. I felt like I just made a lot of good pars and I made some good birdies, and hopefully tomorrow morning the wind won't be as strong and hopefully get some birdies early on.   
  
  Q. Is 9 when the wind changed on you?  
 MICHELLE WIE: It was pretty strong but I think up to that point all of the holes were downwind so when you make that turn, it becomes the hard wind into you. I think it was tough out there, but like I said, I think I was pretty patient so I was proud of myself for that.   
  
  Q. Do you consider yourself to be a good wind player?  
 MICHELLE WIE: I think growing up in Hawaii, there's no joking around, it's a lot of wind but it's about 70 degrees cooler than in Hawaii. Yeah, I grew up in the wind and that will help me.   
  
  Q. Good putt on 15?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it was the toughest putt I had, the one on 15. It broke a lot. I made some good pars. It felt good. It feels good to make putts like that.   
  
  Q. How much break was on the putt?   
 MICHELLE WIE: A lot, I think it was two feet left.   
  
  Q. How far?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Probably about like 25 feet or so.   
  
  Q. Is that the longest?   
 MICHELLE WIE: Actually, no. I had a good one on 2 or 3. I had an 8-iron.   
  
  Q. How were the crowds?  
 MICHELLE WIE: The crowds were very encouraging, and it was nice to see them cheer for you and stuff like that. Like I said yesterday, they are just really respectful out there. I haven't heard a cell phone ring out there or anything. I accidentally hit this one poor lady out there today, so sorry for that.   
  
  Q. Was she hurt?  
 MICHELLE WIE: No, I don't think so.   
  
  Q. Can you go over your birdies and bogeys?   
 MICHELLE WIE: 2, I hit a 5-wood and then I hit like a -- I hit an iron, and that was a birdie, 2-putt, 32-foot putt.   
 6, I hit a driver and then I hit a 5-iron just over the green and chipped with a lob-wedge and that was a 4-foot putt.   
 8, I hit really a 5-wood, right into the bunker, chipped out, and then hit a sand wedge and I missed like 15-foot putt for par.   
 Then 10, I hit a 5-wood left, into the heather and then I hit a shot out into the bunker and then that was a 15-foot putt.   
 I hit a driver, hit a 3-wood just right of the green, chipped with my lob-wedge, had about a 9-foot putt.   
 Then 13, I 3-putted that one from about 30 feet.   
 Then 17, I hit a 4-iron to the green, hit a 4-iron into the bunker and missed a 6-foot putt.   
  
  Q. Ball rolling well in the fairways, or was it drier out there today?  
 MICHELLE WIE: More or less. I think it's not -- I mean, considering the last time we played, it's not as fast as then, but it's drying out. For sure the wind helps and the greens are rolling really nicely today.  
    
  Q. Four shots off the pace; still on target for your first win?  
 MICHELLE WIE: There's a lot of golf ahead of us. I'm in good position. I felt pretty good with the way I played today. Like I said, there's a couple of errant shots out there. But there's three more days of golf and it's the British Open. I feel I can do it.
