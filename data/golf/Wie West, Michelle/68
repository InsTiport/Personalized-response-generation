Q. Great round today.  You must be pleased to have kept yourself back up there?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  Definitely was a patient round.  I had a lot of putts that almost nearly went in.  Just kept patient out there today.  Made a good birdie on the back nine.  It was just a steady round.
Q. And you had a good start, as well.  Being back up at the top of the leaderboard, did you feel any nerves?
MICHELLE WIE: No, I was just really excited.  Honestly I woke up before my alarm clock, just ready to go, just being really excited to be out there, and feeling a little bit of nerves but mostly just excitement.
Q. Familiar territory?
MICHELLE WIE: Good-to-be-back feeling, for sure.
Q. You started off with two opening birdies quite early on.  Talk about how that momentum helped?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, for sure.  I hit it in the bunker on 2, and then I hit it to about 25 feet and made that putt, which is a nice one to make on the second hole, and then the next hole made a 15-footer.  It was just one of those days where after that, it looked like every putt was going to go in but just didn't go in.  Feels good.
Q. Like you said, could have been a much lower round.  You must be pleased with the fact you kept everything steady and no bogeys on the card, as well?
MICHELLE WIE: For sure.  I definitely just kept very patient out there.  It got really frustrating at times just seeing those putts just slip out.  I just kept it steady, and a good up-and-down on the last hole which I'm really proud of.  Looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. How important was that up-and-down to avoid getting a bogey and dropping a shot and staying that much closer to Inbee?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, especially seeing Inbee at 10-under par on the leaderboard, and just having that tough chip shot, it felt really good to keep momentum going and get that up-and-down.  Yeah, it really felt good.
Q. Given that Inbee is used to being on the board in the last rounds, what do you think it will take to fend her off?
MICHELLE WIE: Just keep doing what I'm doing.  Just keep having fun out there.  Try as hard as I can, hit some fairways, hit some greens, make some putts.  Just try to keep having fun out there.
Q. When you talk about staying patient, do you take deep breaths or what do you do?
MICHELLE WIE: I just kind of forget about it and just talk with my caddie and have fun, make fun of it.  You just can't get frustrated.  You can't let yourself get frustrated out there.
Q. So you just make fun of the difficult challenges?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, try to.  It's easier said than done sometimes.  But I think talking with my caddie helps a lot, talking to him, talking to other players and just forgetting about it.
Q. Ariya was saying playing with Inbee makes her feel quite calm because Inbee is so calm.  Do you find when you play with Inbee -- have you played with her recently?  Is that something you notice with her?
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, I went through a phase where I played with her, it felt like every round.  I love playing with her.  I love playing with her caddie, as well.  We get along really well.  It's going to be a fun day.
