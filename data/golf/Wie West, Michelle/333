Q.
So what was going on in your head when this putt left your putter on 18?  Did you feel like it had a chance?
MICHELLE WIE:  Definitely.  I hit it right where I wanted to.  I didn't think it was going to be that fast.  But I thought it was going to go in, but it didn't and that's what happens.
Q.  Talk about 16.
MICHELLE WIE:  I hit the fairway finally and I thought I hit a great 52.  I hit a great gap wedge.  I have no idea why it went right.  Maybe there was a couple of technical difficulties here and there, but I felt like I hit it really solid.  It just didn't go where I wanted it to.
Q.  What do you need to do now to get you from Top 5 to the Winner's Circle?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think it's hitting the shots when I need to and making the putts early on.

I think just being ahead of the pack early on, playing good rounds early on.  And I think I was counting too much on the last moment and I know what I have to work on for the next two weeks so I'm really excited for the U.S. Open.
Q.  What will you work on?
MICHELLE WIE:  I think it's putting and my wedges.  Obviously today my wedges weren't great at all.  So I feel like if I work on it a little bit I think it will be fine.
Q.  Talk about your week trying to qualify for the U.S. Open, then contending in a Major.  Quite a week?
MICHELLE WIE:  Yeah, it was quite a week.  I'm glad I'm going to have a good two weeks off.  Monday was really fun, today was really fun even though it didn't turn out really the way I wanted it to.  I still had a lot of fun out there.

The course was in awesome shape, I felt like I played great and I just, it was a very hectic week.  I think it was a very successful week.  Because even though I didn't play my greatest today, it kind of showed that even though if I don't play my greatest I'm still in the Top 5.
Q.  What was harder, Monday or today?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, Monday was, you know, that was a first time thing for me so I didn't really know what to expect.  I wanted to make it so obviously I was a little disappointed.

But today it was really frustrating that I couldn't get my putting going on a couple of holes, on many holes.  So it was very frustrating in that sense but I still felt like I learned something.
Q.  We heard about how tough the rough was going to be this week and on the back nine you had to play out of it a couple times, including 18.  How tough was that on that final hole?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, this was a hard, it was a hard shot to judge.  You didn't want to be long.  I mean, it was just, it was a really hard shot to judge because you're not really sure if it's going to fly out of that rough.

It was lying pretty well, so I thought it was going to go a little bit more than that.  But it's just, I thought it would go more than that.  It was just really hard to judge when you have water in the back on the left and, you know, I just kind of couldn't really be aggressive on that.
Q.  So many times you just missed putts today.  Is it that close when you look back on this round?
MICHELLE WIE:  It was really close.  I felt like I hit every single putt where I wanted to.  It just some    it felt like every putt was going to go in today.  But it just didn't.  That's what happens.  So I'll have to work on my putting a little bit so hopefully in the next two weeks at the U.S. Open I'll be putting well.
Q.  How do you work on putting?
MICHELLE WIE:  Well, I think I'm just going to try a couple of drills.  I feel like my stroke is awesome right now.  Maybe work on my speed a little bit and just practice making them.  I just need to gain my confidence, work on my confidence a little on my putts and I'm just really excited for the U.S. Open now.
