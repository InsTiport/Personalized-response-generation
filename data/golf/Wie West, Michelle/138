 Q.   Another terrific performance this week.   However, somewhat of a disappointment on the finish.   Are you a leaderboard watcher?   Did you know where you were standing as you were progressing through those last three holes?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   I was a leaderboard watcher.   You know, there isn't a leaderboard for a couple of holes, and I was tied for par, and I saw her, she was 14, and I made a couple more and a couple more, missed a birdie opportunity on 16 and I thought I had it on 17.   I just nuked it over the green.   So just hit a wall on the last hole.   It's a little disappointing for me, but at the same time 4‑under par on the last day, you know, I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   So the burning question on everybody's lips is why the decision on 18 with an iron as opposed to going with your stinger 3‑wood which I've watched you play tremendously all season long.   What was the thought process going on there?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, it's so sloped left to right that I thought about it, if I hit a 3‑wood, it's going straight in the water.   There's no chance of it being in the fairway.   Sara hit a draw and landed on the left edge of the green and she had to chip out.   So I put myself in perfect position.   I just did a nice hook with the 8‑iron into the trees.   So that was unfortunate, but that was really the only place I could go.   I wish I could be a little bit more aggressive on that hole, but there was really no place to hit it.  
   
 Q.   Well, enjoy your week off and thanks for your time.   
MICHELLE WIE:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   Here about this being a new market and last week you were in a new market.   What does it say to you to see all these people out here on a Sunday?  
MICHELLE WIE:   It's great.   You know, I feel like I've seen a lot of young girls, young boys out here.   It's great out here.   And I think it's a great opportunity to grow the game.  
   
 Q.   Is this a market you think that can be a regular on the schedule?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Oh, for sure.   You know, I think that our tour loves Texas, and Texas people love golf, and I think it's a perfect fit.   
   
 Q.   You were talking about how you judge tournaments sometimes by the food.   You had some barbecue adventure while you were here?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah.   It was great.  
   
 Q.   What did you do?  
MICHELLE WIE:   We went to just a couple of barbecue restaurants around here, and it was awesome.  
   
 Q.   Was this Texas barbecue?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Yes, it was.  
   
 Q.   What did you think?  
MICHELLE WIE:   It's awesome.   It's really good.   
   
 Q.   Were these like just local, kind of hole in the wall places?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Uh, yeah.   
   
 Q.   So for tournaments you'd rank this as a food major?  
MICHELLE WIE:   Oh, yeah, for sure.
