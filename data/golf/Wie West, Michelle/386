RHONDA GLENN:  Ladies and gentlemen, Michelle Wie has graciously come down here, no hesitation.

Michelle, what did you say in the presentation; a plane few over right then and we couldn't hear a word you said.
 MICHELLE WIE:   Well, I said     I don't remember what I said, I thanked all of the people.  I just said thank you, and, I don't know.
RHONDA GLENN:  Tough loss.  There's nothing harder than losing, you conducted yourself beautifully this week and you did very well.  I know how disappointed you are, but tell us a little bit maybe when you felt the tide starting to turn in the match?
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, nothing really worked out for me today.  I mean, from the start to the end, I just played terribly.  I think I played the worst that I've played all week.  I only made like four birdies and I made a lot of bogeys and I gave a lot of strokes away.  I didn't play so great.
RHONDA GLENN:  Well, you had 68 this morning and your opponent had 73, so things looked pretty good, and then in the afternoon started to erode somewhat.
MICHELLE WIE:   I think I got a little bit tired at the end.  I couldn't keep my, what do you call, concentration level up.  I just had a hard time putting.  That was the main problem and I couldn't get anything close to the hole.  I got my drivers in the fairway, but that's the best I got.
Q.  You were 4 up in the morning and she won a couple of holes at the end of the first round, how much momentum did she take into the second 18, and how disappointing was it to lose that lead?
MICHELLE WIE:   Even though I was 2 up, I felt like I was 5 down because I lost like so many holes in a row, and I think she had a lot  of grind in the second round.  I tried to think it was a new round, but I had a lot of pressure on me in the second round.  I don't know, I just didn't work, function.  I didn't function at all.
Q.  Were the greens in the afternoon a little bit faster?
MICHELLE WIE:   Well, they were quite fast this morning.  I mean, they were really fast.  All of my putts were going a little bit long.  So, I don't know, they got really grainy towards the end.
Q.  Is this just one round where you just kind of in the afternoon, you just kind of let it go?  Is this something that can be easily fixed?  Are you concerned about long term?
MICHELLE WIE:   Not really.  I mean, I didn't play my game.  I think that it turned out to be better, for next week.  It's really hard to win two tournaments in a row one after another.  I think it's good.  Maybe it's good that I lost today for the U.S. Open.
Q.  Obviously you wanted to win, but is there a lot you'll take away from this in your development process that will help you in the long run?
MICHELLE WIE:   Of course.  Like I said, every day     a couple of days ago     I learn how to shape my ball.  I did that really good today.  I learned how to make the putts.  I learned how to swing easy and put it in the fairway.  I got a lot of my game plan done, and I think that this week will help me in the long term.
Q.  When you had been     when she had hit the ball out of play on the 15th hole, did you feel like, "okay, I've got a shot here again," some momentum that had built back up to you, you had got it all square and you're in the lead again and the tee box again?
MICHELLE WIE:   Yeah, I didn't have the honors the whole day.  I felt that it was good momentum for me, and it was my fault that I didn't carry that, you know, to the next hole.  I just made a horrible 3 putt.  That should have never came up.
Q.  I know you're only 14, but she's 15, there's just a lot of young players out here.  As far as the talent level goes, do you see that increasing and them gunning for you a little more, the talent overall, if you can talk about that?
MICHELLE WIE:   Since last year, a lot of younger people have come out.  Last year almost every player that I played against was college players.  This week, also, but there's a lot more people that are under 17.  Like the average was 17 years and three months and I was the youngest.  I think that golf is getting better and golf is getting younger, and I think that a lot of new people are coming up.
RHONDA GLENN:  Thank you very much.
