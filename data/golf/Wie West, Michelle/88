Q. Could you just sum up your day?MICHELLE WIE: Really close, just a couple of shots here and there.  I couldn't get my irons as close as I wanted to.  The holes were -- to give yourself a good position, you have to get it close and make a birdie. Just couldn't get that going today.  Made a lot of good par saves kind of a mediocre round, but at the same time just a lot of good feelings, and I'm excited about the rest of the tournament.Q. What was it like to be introduced as the defending champion and what was the feeling coming in?MICHELLE WIE: It was awesome.  It was another great day today.  The crowds were amazing, great golf course.  I love the USGA events.  It's always fun.  You always get that exciting feeling in your bones when you tee off on the first hole at a U.S. Open.  Even if you are the defending champion or not.  And it's pretty exciting.  It's pretty cool.Q. You can't win the tournament on day one, but to be able to keep it close and to keep from falling off the cliff, how important is that?MICHELLE WIE: You can't win the tournament on the first day, but you definitely can lose it.  I definitely feel like I'm in there.  I think I held it together today.  I had a lot of opportunities where I had to make big putts, and I'm proud of myself for that.  I definitely feel like I'm -- it's a tough golf course, so I think you have to try to make birdies when you can.Q. How did it feel today?MICHELLE WIE: Wasn't too bad.  I definitely get moments, but it's definitely getting better.Q. How is it shaping up?MICHELLE WIE: Definitely feeling more and more comfortable.  I think that's where a couple of shots come from.  It's not automatic yet.  Still have to think about it a little bit.  But every shot I'm swinging, every hole I'm playing it's feeling more and more comfortable.  I need more holes under my belt and I think it's going to be worth it.
