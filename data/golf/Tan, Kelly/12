 Q.  How would you assess the week?  
KELLY TAN: I can tell you that it's not my best week out here.  Yeah, I didn't really put everything together this week for myself, but I really enjoyed the week, and get to play in front of my family and fans.  So that was pretty incredible.   
 Q.  What is that experience like to actually play in front of the family and all of the Malaysian fans out here this week?  
KELLY TAN: Yeah, you would think this is my Fifth appearance back home, since five years ago on Thursday.  But it's a really good feeling that I will cherish for the rest of my life.   
 Q.  What is it that you think that you could have done better this week?  
KELLY TAN: I would say my ball-striking was a little off.  I didn't really have a lot of opportunity for birdies.  And there was a lot more on scrambling, so I think, yeah, if I could have hit my irons better, give myself a better chance on the green, I would think there would be more putts held.   
 Q.  What is your plans for the off-season?  
KELLY TAN: Nothing.  Anything but golf.  I'm going to putt my golf bag away for a little bit and just going to spend a lot of time with my family and friends.
