Q. How's it been being back here in Malaysia?  The first two days what's it been like?
KELLY TAN: It's been great.  I've been home for three weeks.  You know, just been able to spend a lot quality time with my family and meeting my friends that I haven't seen in few months.
It's just been really nice.  I'm just so happy to be out here playing golf in my home country.
Q. Run us through today.  Was what today like out there?
KELLY TAN: You know, things wasn't really going my way.  Ball striking wasn't as good as yesterday.
Didn't give myself as many chances as I had yesterday, but my chipping was great.  I actually got to save some nice pars.
Q. You feel the support out there when you're out there?
KELLY TAN: Yeah, I have my parents here with me.  I'm from down south, so they drove three hours just to come watch me play.  That means the world to me.
