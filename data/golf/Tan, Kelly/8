Q. So you've been through a lot in your professional career. What has this week been like for you compared to maybe other events you've experienced?
KELLY TAN: Yeah, it's been a tough couple years for me for my golfing career. Just the fact that I have a lot of good people around me supporting me and just keep telling me that I just keep working hard, and I have, and I'm glad that the results shows.
Yeah, I'm really happy with the way I'm playing.
Q. What was it like preparing for Q-Series this year and what have you taken from your experiences to prepare you for this?
KELLY TAN: You know, I never really wanted to prepare for Q-Series. I play on the Symetra Tour and won on the second event and was hoping with a good start I could have a really good finish to get my card, finish inside the top 10.
I played well. Unfortunately I didn't, but I just knew that I was playing good all year. Knowing that I can do what I do to just come out and stay patient for Q-Series, I mean, it's brutal two weeks. It's a marathon, Iron Man, whatever you want to call it, and I just stay in it.
Q. What have you learned about your game and maybe yourself and how you deal with this kind of situation throughout this entire year?
KELLY TAN: Yeah, the best thing is there are eight rounds the golf. You still get frustrated with the putt miss or shot miss, but you got to know there are eight rounds, however many holes that you can make it up, and just stay patient.
Q. You've had some notable experiences, including the Olympics. How much do you think about your Olympic journey?
KELLY TAN: Oh, yeah, and I would love to compete again next year. That's one of my goals, and I'm just going to keep at it.
