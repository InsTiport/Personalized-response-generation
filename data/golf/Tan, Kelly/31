   KELLY TAN: I haven't finished my round. I have 2 1/2 more to go. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 KELLY TAN: Yes, maybe the top Asian for the win. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 KELLY TAN: Yes, I'm happy with my putting. I rolled some good putts today. 

 Q. The rain delay, does it affect you a lot, having to go out, play two shots and then go back off the course?
 KELLY TAN: No, actually I went back and had a birdie. Yeah, just get myself warmed up before and play normally. 

 Q. Are you doing any type of preparation for the weekend? 
 KELLY TAN: Yes, I will. I just have to be more patient and putts will drop and I'll be fine. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 KELLY TAN: Yes, definitely. It's been good. Just yesterday's great game is only two holes that cost me, and it was on either 7 and 10. Today I'm on 7 right now and nothing happened. I just play happily on that hole and I'll be fine. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 KELLY TAN: Yes, I did have a big change on my swing. Especially my posture. And yeah, we have a lot involved in the academy, we have mental conditioning and just all for golf and it helps a lot. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 KELLY TAN: Yeah, I hit further. The course is playing shorter than last year and I just have to get used to it.
