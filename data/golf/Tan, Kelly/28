 Q.   Other than 18, pretty good round.   Have to be feeling pretty good about things.   
    KELLY TAN:   Yes.   You know, I had kind of slow start.   Bogey the first, but managed to get three back, so back to 2â€‘under on the front nine.  
    Then things started to get going on the back nine.   Couple putts falls and great break on 16.   Chipped it in from like 30 yards.  
    So that was good.  
   
 Q.   How was the course playing today?   Seemed a little difficult for some people.   Not you so much.   
    KELLY TAN:   Well, it's playing wetter and longer, of course.   I took that into account and just played with what I've got and everything.   
    Just tried to make as many putts as I can, because that's kind of do with the scoring.  
   
 Q.   You're going home next week.   Coming into this tournament, how do you keep focused on this tournament knowing all that you have in store next week?  
    KELLY TAN:   Yeah, it was good to be home the past two weeks.   I got into this event like five days before the week, and that was a good news.   
    I know there will be a lot of pressure next week, but I'm just going to keep playing my game and not worry about what other people think and wants me to do.  
   
 Q.   And your approach for tomorrow now?  
    KELLY TAN:   Going to go aggressive tomorrow.   Just going to give to a shot.   Nothing to lose.   Hope for a good finish.
