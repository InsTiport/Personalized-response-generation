Q. I would say another solid round here at Pinehurst No. 9.
KELLY TAN: Uh-huh, for sure. I think today played a lot tougher, but I gave myself a lot of good looks. I only missed one green and I could putt off the green, so I would count that I hit 18 greens.
So I have a lot of good looks and played really well.
Q. What does it do for your confidence of your entire game after having a couple good rounds out here during such a kind of grueling process?
KELLY TAN: Yeah, it's Q-Series; just got to stay in it. You just never know what's going to happen next day or five days, however many days.
So I just came in here with the mentality of being patient and giving myself good chances because I know I'm hitting the ball good. I really like where I'm at, and I'm looking forward for the next two days.
Q. I was doing some research, and when you were a rookie you were here playing in the U.S. Women's Open.
KELLY TAN: Uh-huh.
Q. Do you ever think about what it was like coming back here. That was five years ago, and now it's Pinehurst all over again. Was that your first time at Pinehurst?
KELLY TAN: Yes, it was my first time, 2014. Yeah, jeez, five years. No, it was a fun experience for me because I had to go for U.S. Open qualifier and I made it there and got into the Open, so that was really fun.
No, I'm just glad to be here and experience the No. 6 and No. 9.
