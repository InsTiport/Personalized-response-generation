Q.
Did you read the greens by yourself?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  Yes.
Q.  How was it playing with David Ishii?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  Like playing a practice round with him, because I know him from playing in Japan.
Q.  How did you play?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  I played really well overall.
Q.  Did you have a caddy?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  I came in without a caddy and I picked up a 15 year old kid that's never caddied before.  He's played golf for six years, I think he said.  And he didn't read the greens for me, the pro read all the greens, but I ended up shooting a low score.
