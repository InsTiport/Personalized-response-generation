KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  I changed my club on 17 after I saw what the other guys were saying.
Q.  When did he first realize again that he was still in the lead or not in the lead but tied for third?  When did he become aware of that again?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  16.  He was 1 under there.
Q.  What did he say on those last two holes?
KATSUYOSHI TOMORI:  Oh, he hasn't said anything yet.  He says he's very pleased with today's round.  Very pleased.

I was going for just making the cut and I wasn't trying to go for top 10 or anything like that.
