 Q.  Was the golf course playing as tough as it was for some people?  How were you able to stay bogey-free?  
NA YEON CHOI: It's tough condition out there.  I don't know how I played without bogey.  I focus one shot at a time.  My emotion control was very good out there.  Even when my ball finished in not a good position, still, I tried to make kind of an easy shot for the next shot.   
I think I played very smartly and safely, and I hit so many good, solid shots out there today, especially today.  I feel good about my round today.  This I think is the best round, almost the last two years.   
 Q.  Do you feel like that was something that had been building up?  
NA YEON CHOI: I'm not sure, but honestly, this is officially the last tournament for me this year.  I know my game's gradually getting better this year.  My slump, like started last year in the summer, and definitely gradually getting better this year.   
This is the last tournament.  I don't want any regret after this week.  I think I handled very well my mental game out there.  I think that's why my shot and putts and everything was good.   
 Q.  You're only going to be maybe a couple shots back.  The leaders are still out there but your last round of 2017, how do you feel going into tomorrow?  
NA YEON CHOI: Like to be honest with you, I don't want any good -- okay.  Start over.   
I don't want to think about anything, about result, you know what I mean?  Like first day, I shoot 5-under, that was good.  Then yesterday, I shoot 5-over.  Then today, I got 4-under today.  I think I'm happy with that, especially today, without bogey.  Even if I didn't play well tomorrow, if I don't play well tomorrow, that's okay because I think I did my best, and no matter what, I'm happy and I'm very happy to finish 2017, my season.
