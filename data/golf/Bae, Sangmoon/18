Q.   The front nine was pretty easy.   I know the eighth hole you had that one putt, but you played so solid, on the back nine it got a little funny or a little scary a little bit, huh?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, I think I was a little nervous, had a little focus, too.   I don't know why.   I didn't want to look at the scoreboard, but I did.   I looked a lot.   That's why I made a lot of bogeys on the back nine.

Q.   When you got your first win, you came from behind.   Now this one with a big lead, easier to come from behind, is it not?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, it really means a lot.   It's the first tournament, and I couldn't play well last year, last season, I mean.   But I have a lot of confidence now.   I could play well, a lot more than last season. 

Q.   You had a big lead at one point on Sunday, got interesting down the stretch.   How would you describe this final round?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   I tried to really enjoy my game, but I made a lot of bogeys.   I don't know, but I know how well I did.   It was a really good experience today.

Q.   How nervous were?   What were your emotions out there coming down the stretch?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Actually I had mixed emotions, a little nervous and happy and excited and everything.   I don't know, but just putt‑‑ I think my swing was really, really good this week, so that's why I played good this week.

Q.   You talked throughout this week, you weren't thinking about winning.   Now that you have won, how excited are you? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, my confidence level is much higher than last season.   I could play well, much better than last season.
