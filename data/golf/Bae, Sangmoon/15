 Q.   Halfway through the tournament, you're right where you want to be, I would imagine.   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   I had a pretty solid round.   Actually I played really good in the first round, but I missed a lot of putts on the back nine today.   I don't know, I think I misread a couple times but I'm okay.   I didn't make a bogey today.   It was a really good thing.   
   
 Q.   Probably the hardest thing to do here is to get the read of the greens sometimes.   Obviously a lot of hills but also you can't tell with the mountain, the slope?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, sometimes you hit a little downgrain putt and it's really, really fast, so definitely a little scared.   I should have been a little more aggressive on the greens.   Yeah, be good tomorrow and on Monday, too.   
   
 Q.   Excited for the next two rounds?   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, I'm really looking forward to playing the next two rounds.
