Q. Came down to the very final match here on this Sunday.  How did this day play out for you, especially those last couple of holes?
SANGMOON BAE: You know, it wasn't easy for us.  The winds were really strong out there.
I didn't play well.  But feel bad right now, but it's all right.  It was a good memory.  I had a really good week this week.  It was awesome.
Q. When did you have a sense that your match might determine The Presidents Cup; that it would all come down to you and Bill?
SANGMOON BAE: I knew that at the 16th, was pretty nervous.  That's why I hit that really bad chip over there.  It's all right.  My golf is continuing.  It's all right.
Q. You talked about your nerves throughout the weekend.  How were the emotions, knowing you were in your home country and trying to win The Presidents Cup?
SANGMOON BAE: It means a lot, a lot of Korean people looking at me.  I played very well and I want to say thank you so much for the Korean fans and our team.  It was a really, really cool week.
