Q.   Sang Moon, I'm sure you're happy to roll that last putt in.   What a great read.   Tell me a little bit about your round, 6â€‘under par.   You're tied for the lead. 
SANG MOON BAE:   Yeah, I had a really, really good round, a pretty solid round, and I made a lot of putts and just one bogey today.   It was a pretty nice round. 

Q.   What do you think the key to scoring well is on this golf course?   Is it more keeping the ball in the fairway because the rough is up a little bit?   What's worked for you?
SANG MOON BAE:   Actually I don't like this rough.   It's pretty thick.   So the main point is the fairway.   The fairways are pretty narrow.   I think I'm driving it pretty well today, I mean, this week.   I played a little easier than the other time, and my driver has improved, I think.   It was a pretty good round. 

Q.   And the style of this golf course, it's more of a traditional design.   Does that fit your eye?   Do you enjoy that type of a golf course? 
SANG MOON BAE:   Yeah, I like this course.   Pretty narrow, as I told you, and you need really, really good irons because the greens are pretty small, too.   Green speed is not really fast, and a little soft.   It's really good for me, so I played well today.
