Q.   With the wind changing around did it make the golf course play more difficult?
SANG MOON‑BAE:   Yeah.   Had a pretty tough day today, you know.   The winds was pretty offset today.   SO in club choice, so really, really different today.

Q.   Everyone thinks of the wind and off the tee and approaches into the green, but I know it affected the greens, the speed of the greens, the grain of the greens.   Everything was different about the golf course. 
SANG MOON‑BAE:   Actually, yeah.   Greens speed is fine, but you know, the same hole is different conditions.   Like felt like a different course, like on the fourth hole, I hit hybrid there.   I hit pitching wedge yesterday, though.   So really, really different course as it was really tough day.

Q.   Did you ever get comfortable on the greens?
SANG MOON‑BAE:   No.   Actually I'll say no, because I got three‑putt today, one time.   But I missed a lot of putts. 
A little disappointed, but I'm okay. 

Q.   Yeah, you're okay.   You're still winning.   What do you think about going into the final round?
SANG MOON‑BAE:   Yeah.   Just one more day, because you know, I'm in position to win, but because, you know, 17 is leading.   So not really far away.   I think I am doing good and I will play pretty good tomorrow hopefully.
