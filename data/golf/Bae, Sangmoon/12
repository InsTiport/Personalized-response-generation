 Q.   Tell us a little about your round today.   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   I felt like I could have done better.   I didn't play well the last nine holes.   I don't know, I got a little pressure probably.   But I think I did it pretty well.   
   
 Q.   How did the weather affect your round?   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Actually weather wasn't good.   It was rain, a little wind.   Not easy.   The course is not easy, too.   But I told myself to hang in there.   But I think that I did pretty good today.   
   
 Q.   Already a two‑time winner on the PGA TOUR season so far.   What's your strategy going into the next tournament, and which one is that?   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   You know, playing pretty good lately.   So I'm really trying hard to win any tournament.   I think I'm pretty close.   So I have a little more confidence than last year.   So doing great.   Honda is next.
