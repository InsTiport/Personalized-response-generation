Q.   Very good round today, no bogeys, quite a few birdies.   What did you do well?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Well, I play the way I play.   So I'm so excited now.   I had a great fun out there.   I went low today. 
It was good playing.   I hit a bunch of good shots and made many birdies. 

Q.   A lot of low scores here.   What number will it take to win tomorrow?
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Well, 16‑under right now is leading but it will get to over 20.   I'll play aggressively tomorrow.   And actually, I like the Palmer Course, so I will play well tomorrow.
