 Q.   Sang Moon Bae, 6‑under 66.   You had it going in pretty windy conditions.   How did you do it?   
SANG MOON BAE:   Well, I did really, really good today.   Super start this afternoon.   Birdie first hole, eagle second hole.   It was pretty impressive.   I did a great job today.   
   
 Q.   One bogey, one eagle, pretty even round otherwise.   Just talk about it.   What was working?   
SANG MOON BAE:   Winds were really strong out there, so a couple holes were really long for me.   For everybody, I think.   So keep patience, really long shots, and have to make par that hole, a couple holes.   I made just one bogey today, and I had a really, really solid round.  
   
 Q.   How are the greens?  
SANG MOON BAE:   Greens are a little slower than the other times, but not a big deal.   These greens are really hard to read.   That's mostly important to this course.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about the quick turnaround tomorrow, afternoon today then morning tomorrow?  
SANG MOON BAE:   Yeah, I had a long day today, but our start tomorrow morning should be‑‑ I have a lot of confidence and it's getting more higher.   I think I will have a great round.   Pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, conditions tomorrow will be a little bit more calmer in the morning.   Do you take a different approach than you did this afternoon?  
SANG MOON BAE:   I think weather.   It was really hot today, but morning will be better than afternoon tee time.   A little more concentration on the course.   Be good tomorrow.
