 Q.   You made it to the quarter finals.   Talk about the experience so far and especially today's round.   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Today was very nice.   I had good luck today.   John Senden is a very good iron player.   But I tried to focus on my game.   That's it.   I made a lot of birdie putts so I could win today.  
   
 Q.   Coming from the Asian Tour through Q‑School, has it been a hard adjustment?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, PGA is a blast.   I love it.   I played Japan Tour last three years, and it was a great experience.   
   
 Q.   Have you played much match play before?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   No, first time.  
   
 Q.   This is your first time playing match play?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yes.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow's match.  
   
 Q.   Anything special you'll do tonight to get ready or what have you been doing the last couple of days to get ready?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   It's match play, so only I will try to focus on my game, that's it.
