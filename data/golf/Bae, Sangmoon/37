 Q.   Tell me about the eagle on number 8, the distance and the club.   
SANG‑MOON BAE:   I tried a 5‑iron to the pin and it was a little bit of a push, just a little bit, but the ball carried perfectly, so it was about two meters from the hole.   
   
 Q.   What was the yardage?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   195.   That was the second shot.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like that was a big help to your round?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, this is my first tournament in this year, but the two amateurs and the two professionals is just, I could not focus on my game, so.   
But no, they are very good men on the golf course, so it was very nice to play with them.  
   
 Q.   And how do you feel after the first round?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   The first round was very nice, I played very well today, and I felt very, very well.   So I look forward to another three days.   
   
 Q.   Are you happy to be one shot off the lead?   Are you happy to be in that position?  
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, of course I'm very happy, but I will focus on the other three days, tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday.
