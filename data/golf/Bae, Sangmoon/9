Q. Jason is playing well.  How difficult is it to try to catch him?
SANGMOON BAE: Jason is the champion this week.  My game wasn't as good today as compare yesterday.  A lot of bogeys.  Missed a lot of hard putts.  That's why I shot 2-over par today.
Q. Did you ever play with Jason before?
SANGMOON BAE: Yesterday was first time.
Q. First time you played with him?
SANGMOON BAE: Yes.
Q. What do you make of his game?
SANGMOON BAE: You know, he's the best in the world obviously.  He's really good.  I like his game.
Q. Does it put extra pressure on your own game when you're trying to catch a guy who is playing that well?
SANGMOON BAE: I made a bogey, a big bogey, that changed things.  That made a really big hole.
If I make a birdie on 4 or 5, I think I make it with good momentum.
Q. How much is the Presidents Cup on your mind?
SANGMOON BAE: That is really big to me.  I really want to play.
