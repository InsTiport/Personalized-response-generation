 Q.   A little fist pump on the birdie putt.   Did you think this of the significance to it?  
SANG-MOON BAE:   Yeah.   Actually, I didn't play well this year.   So -- but I don't know why.   I working hard and I worked hard but, you know, my goal was just I want to play -- playing in New York so, you know, playoff, lot of points so I have to play good again next week so I want to play four more events this year.  
   
 Q.   No explanation for difference between last year and this year?  
SANG-MOON BAE:   No.   I didn't change anything.   I'm working same thing but I think a little mental problem but I think a lot, thinking a lot about golf, so I want to make me a bit more clean in my head.   I think it's working, pretty better, better than the other time.  
   
 Q.   Were you nervous coming into this week knowing you had to have a good performance to make it?  
SANG-MOON BAE:   Actually, yes.   Yes.   I had a little pressure.   I played -- I shoot even front-9 so I had to -- I had to play really good solid round on the back-9.   I had really good round on the back-9.  
   
 Q.   How did you, with that pressure on you, how did you manage not to let it make you play poorly?  
SANG-MOON BAE:   I played very aggressive.   I hit driver every hole and then I have wedge shots and made a lot of birdies so that's how I played.  
   
 Q.   What's your mindset next week, you have to play very well to advance?  
SANG-MOON BAE:   Same thing.   Just, you know, my swing is good, putting is okay.   Just play same thing.
