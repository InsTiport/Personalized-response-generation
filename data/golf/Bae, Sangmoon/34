Q.   Adventurous finish to your round; talk us through the 14th hole, the one‑putt par. 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   I had an eagle from the second shot.   I hit 3‑wood, but I hit it pretty good, nice par. 

Q.   And unfortunately a triple‑bogey at the 16th. 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   (Laughing).   Yeah, so funny, my second shot, a little far, through the fairway.   So the lie was very tough in the rough, so my chipping, putting, yeah, everything wasn't too bad.

Q.   Not many people can say a triple‑bogey is funny; you rebounded with a birdie at the 17th. 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Yeah, I couldn't concentrate on my game, so I got birdie on 17.   I'm looking forward to play tomorrow.   That's it.
