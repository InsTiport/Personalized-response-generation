Q. Greenside here at the 18th.  Sangmoon, great putt here on the last.  What was going through your mind as you stood over that putt?
SANGMOON BAE: Actually I knew it was really, really big putt.  We played pretty solid but didn't make a lot of the putt, though.
It was a really good match and I was a little nervous with that putt.
Q. Danny, how would you describe the pressure you were under in front of this raucous crowd?
DANNY LEE: I mean, it wasn't easy playing out here.  I never felt this kind of nerve before, and I just want to give all my -- all the credit to Sangmoon Bae today.  I feel like I didn't do anything except the 16th hole.
Sangmoon just played really well today.
Q. It came down to the very last hole, the very last putt.  Playing here in your home country, what are the emotions like for you right now?
SANGMOON BAE: You know, really, really a lot of people came out here and they were supporting us.  It was really helpful and I was really excited.
Q. What does it mean for you to partner up with him to get a point for the internationals?
DANNY LEE: I don't know.
SANGMOON BAE: Don't cry.
DANNY LEE: I feel like I just won a golf tournament.  I wasn't hitting it that well today, but Sangmoon Bae was playing really, really good.  Thank God for that.
I just want to give all the credit to Sangmoon Bae today.  Crowd were just amazing.  Never been so nervous in my life.  I never seen this many people in one hole.  Every hole, actually.
It was pretty awesome.
