Q.   How was it today? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   The winds were strong out there, but I hit a bunch of putts today, very steady. 

Q.   You are happy with your position? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   One shot behind Keegan, looking forward to tomorrow. 

Q.   You had a chance to tie it there at the final hole.   Were you thinking about that? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   The last hole?   Yeah.   But, you know, it's the last hole. 
It was not easy putt. 

Q.   How about catching him tomorrow, how difficult will that be for you? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Just only play just my game.   Nobody knows.   Wind will blow but, yeah, I will play, focus on my game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Oh, yeah, I didn't think about it, you know, because it's supposed to be windy and crazy so, yeah, just thinking about my game. 

Q.   There were 29 golfers sub par today.   Were the conditions the worst you've seen in a long time? 
SANG‑MOON BAE:   Nice weather, wind is a little slow, so I had to be a little aggressive.   I play very well.
