Q.   Well played, 70 today for the joint lead on 7‑under.   You must be happy with your position. 
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yes, I'm very happy with my performance today.   Actually I hit‑‑ my game was very solid today.   I hit good irons, a lot of birdie chances, but only one bad hole.   But yeah. 

Q.   What happened on 16?
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   On 16 I hit driver in the bunker and I had 50 yards to the flag, and I tried to hit it too hard.   The full swing with the ball, it went like 100 over everything to the desert.   I cannot get it out and make four on, two putts, yeah, that's double on a short par‑4.

Q.   But a good birdie on the last hole to get you back up on 7‑under. 
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, it's a good comeback on the last hole.

Q.   How do you feel now for the weekend?
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   I will try to, yeah, play my game, hit on‑‑ I know that my putting is working this week.   I'll try to hit as many greens as I can, and I can do the putt, yeah.

Q.   You won three times on the Asian development Tour this year.   What would it mean to maybe win on the Asian Tour this week? 
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, this is my last chance to play on the Asian Tour this week.   Yeah, I think it's a‑‑ I feel very confident now because I played like I didn't feel pressure myself because I already have Tour card next year, and I learn a lot before I came this week from the past event.   Yeah, I feel very confident.

Q.   What can you bring from those wins to this tournament the next two days?
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, actually it's the same.   It's me against the golf course, you know.   But on this Tour, yeah, a bit tough, but yeah, I learned how to make cut now the past weeks, and now, yeah, I think it's the same playing on the last two days, you just focus and just play your game.

    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   This is my first time.

Q.   What do you make of the course?
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   The course is in very good condition, perfect condition.   The greens, it's like where I play in my home course, I think it's, yeah, a bit easier for me to read, and the grass, yeah. 

Q.   You said your coach is here with you this week.
