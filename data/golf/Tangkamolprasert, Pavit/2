 Q.   Two eagles in the round, as well.   You must be really happy.   
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yes.   The first one I hit from 280, around 10 feet, but on 18 I hit a bad drive in the bunker and then I laid up, and it's 170 to the pin, and I hit‑‑ a bit downwind, I hit 8‑iron, and gone in.   It's big confidence from there.  
   
 Q.   Conditions were not easy.   
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, the wind changed like a lot, and you have to be like pretty sure to hit before because it's very difficult to calculate the wind here, but yeah, I got my coach.   He's helped me a lot this week.   
   
 Q.   After winning the ADT Order of Merit and then getting your Asian Tour card, has the feeling changed for you?   
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah.   Actually I think I have to start playing next year, but this year I have to gain experience.   Order of Merit is the bonus for me.   Just play, play, gain experience, learn from the players, because the Tour, I think it's quite a bit different from the ADT, the standard and quality here.   
   
 Q.   You played in the last few Asian Tour events.   What has been the biggest difference for you, thinking you need to push yourself to get to that level and have a chance of winning?  
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, only thing is I think I have to be more steady for playing on the Asian Tour because if you miss, you can miss cuts, but in the ADT you can go for it, the cut is a bit higher, but in Asian Tour you have to try and make cut first, but the last two days you can go up.  
   
 Q.   First time playing on this golf course; does it suit your game?   Do you feel comfortable here?  
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, I like the greens here, and the fairway, the condition, everything is like Amata Spring where I played from the last week.   Yeah, the grass, and the greens are very nice.   I putt very good.  
   
 Q.   What will it be important to do the next few days now that you're in this spot?  
    PAVIT TANGKAMOLPRASERT:   Yeah, just keep playing.   I'm enjoying my golf game at the moment, and looking forward for the next year.
