Q. 13 birdies between the two of you; you can't hang your head when you lose a match when somebody else is obviously playing really well.
KENZIE WRIGHT: Yeah, definitely.  It was back and forth all day long, and we both played great golf.  You know, ultimately she made a couple more birdies than I did, but that's how it goes.
Q. Is that fun to be in that kind of a battle when you guys both know you're playing at the top of your games?
KENZIE WRIGHT: Absolutely, yeah.  It was super fun all day long.  I mean, it was a little stressful, but it was super fun.  These are the types of matches you look forward to.
Q. You said you didn't play a lot this summer.  What do you take from this week that will help you in your senior season at Alabama?
KENZIE WRIGHT: I mean, this was definitely one of the best courses I've ever played, and being in the heat of the competition and making it to the quarterfinals is just going to be something that I'm going to take to every tournament, and just the competition of it and just the match today alone taught me a lot.
Q. Had you ever played here before?
KENZIE WRIGHT: Not this course, no.
Q. You've played across the street before?
KENZIE WRIGHT: No, I haven't.
Q. You guys are only an hour or so away.
KENZIE WRIGHT: Yeah, exactly.  I've never been here before, so it was awesome.
Q. Next year you get a chance to play the Women's Amateur again.  I don't know what your future plans are; are you going to Q-school?
KENZIE WRIGHT: I will, yes, sir.
Q. This fall or --
KENZIE WRIGHT: No, next year, next summer.
Q. So you will play the Women's Am next year?
KENZIE WRIGHT: Exactly, and get another shot at it.
