DONNA ANDREWS:  I had a great match today  being teamed against Lotte.  She is just such a great  player and has had such a great year.  I knew going in  it was going to be a tough match.  Unfortunately I  didn't get off to a good start.  Captain wouldn't have  been proud of me if I didn't win the first hole.  She  told us we had to.  But I double hit a chip on the  first hole and ended up conceding the hole.  Made a great putt on the second hole to halve  the second hole and then made a wonderful birdie on the  third to bring it back to even.  And from that point on, I felt like I was  playing pretty solid golf.  We made the turn; even  Lotte had knocked it up there about 10 feet on 9 and I  had about a 25 footer which I made and she made it  right on top of me.  And then I really turned the  lights on birdied 10, 11, 13, and then she 3-putted 15,  so I won a lot of holes back there; just played good  solid golf; had a lot of birdies today.

Q.  Did the heavy rains have anything to do with  the golf course or did the grounds crew keep everything  up to par?  
 
DONNA ANDREWS:  I thought the grounds crew  did a super job, as much rain as they had last night,  it rained all night here, and there were a lot of wet  spots in the fairways, but they had pretty much cleared  all the landing areas and the greens were in superb  shape.  They were out there getting the leaves off even  while we were playing.  I think we really have to give  them a round of applause for keeping the course in such  great shape despite the weather that they had.
