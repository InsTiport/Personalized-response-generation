 Q.  How did your second round go?  
DONNA ANDREWS: I felt great about the way I played.  Made a couple silly errors that I wish I could have back, a couple wedges that I missed the green with.  But overall felt great about the way I struck the ball and rolled it well, just still not making as many as I want to, but was able to make three birdies today, so I felt okay about that.   
 Q.  You're hosting here, too.  How hard is it to play and host?  
DONNA ANDREWS: Not as hard as it used to be.  It seems easier for me now that I'm a senior because I don't think I expect as much out of myself out there.  So able to walk down the fairways and say hi to folks and able to refocus.  So I don't think I was very good at that when we played here when I was on the regular Tour.  So I think I've done a better job.   
 Q.  Do you think Ms. Bell would be proud to have the senior women come here to her establishment?  
DONNA ANDREWS: Oh, I know Ms. Bell is shining down on us.  I think this is just a tribute to her because of all that she did for women's golf.  That's why a lot of the players came to play was to honor Ms. Bell.   
 Q.  Will you be playing the weekend?  
DONNA ANDREWS: I will be playing the weekend.   
 Q.  What kind of expectations do you have?  
DONNA ANDREWS: I hit it well enough today, I said to my caddie, I'm going to go out there and shoot even par one day this weekend.   
 Q.  What do you think it will take to win this tournament?  
DONNA ANDREWS: I don't know what it'll take to win.  I haven't even looked at the scoreboard.  But I want to beat this golf course one day.
