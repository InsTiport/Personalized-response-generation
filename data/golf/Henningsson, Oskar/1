  OSKAR HENNINGSSON: I've been playing really good for a while now, so it feels good. Very much enjoying just being out there playing actually. I don't feel any pressure at all, just very much enjoying it. Playing really relaxed.  
 Today was very good. Played solid all the way from the tee to the greens and putted really well. I missed -- I 3-putted the 4th, the par 5, and made a bogey there. So that's 40 metres after two shots and make a bogey, that was unlucky, but otherwise I played really solid and just kept going. I got a couple of good birdies in and felt all right. Just kept going.   
  
  Q. Did you take extra confidence from the Tour School victory?  
 OSKAR HENNINGSSON: Yeah, I'm starting to feel confident shooting these low scores, 6-, 7- , 8-under, I've been doing it for the last part of the season. And of course winning always gives you good confidence. I had a good start last week, as well, up at Leopard Creek and was at the top for a while. It feels very good.   
 As I say, I feel like I can play without pressure at all and I very much enjoy being out there and playing it.  
  
  Q. What do you make of the conditions and the heat?   
 OSKAR HENNINGSSON: I enjoy it, but it was windy for like three holes this morning and I was expecting a lot of wind today. So I was prepared for the wind but then it calmed down. But I enjoy playing both these conditions and when it's windier, as well. So it doesn't really matter to me what the conditions are.   
  
  Q. And the golf course?  
 OSKAR HENNINGSSON: It's a beautiful golf course. It's really challenging. You have to hit a couple of decent shots out there to get through with a decent score. So I think it's really a fair golf course.
