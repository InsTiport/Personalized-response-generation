Q.   I know it's another tough loss, what kind of was the difference do you think this week for you guys?
PAULA CREAMER:   I hate to ever say it was tough breaks here and that, and putts fell, putts didn't fall, but it kind of was like that this week.   We had some bad breaks, but that's golf and we just got to kind of pull it together, we're a great team, we got along so well. 
If it comes to team bonding, this was the epitome of that.   And going into Germany we have got two years to sit on this and four years since we have won the cup and I can tell you we'll be ready to go.

Q.   When you see a player like Caroline Hedwall, how she played this week, to make the birdie putt on 18, to go 5â€‘0, how impressive is that?
PAULA CREAMER:   As an athlete, as a player, I've played five matches several times and to go undefeated, that's awesome.   Good for her.   As an athlete, that takes, that's a lot of respect to her.   She played great, she played strong, and to finish with a birdie, that's pretty good.   You can't really say anything other than that.   And that kind of sums up the week. 

Q.   You guys had four rookies on your team, and they got a lot of experience and seemed to really kind of be tough in their matches today, even if they didn't necessarily come out with points.   How much does that say for the future of this team?
PAULA CREAMER:   We all know what it's like.   U.S. soil is a completely different thing than European soil.   And I know this is the first time we have ever lost here, but they got to see what it was like to have just so many people behind you.   And when we go to Germany it's going to be the opposite and we're going to be ready.   But we're going to be tough and we're going to be strong and who knows, maybe that's what we need right now.
