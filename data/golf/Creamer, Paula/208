  Q. Can you summarize your play today?  
 PAULA CREAMER: I have to look at it as I shot 1-over. 18 holes, I had some good shots. I had some not-so-smart decisions, but overall I'll take where I'm at.   
 I don't feel like I'm far out of it by any means. There's a couple things I need to fine-tune from this round. I need to come out tomorrow and not play the same way.   
  
  Q. You tried to make a nice rally, two birdies at the end.   
 PAULA CREAMER: Definitely. I gave myself a bunch of chances those last couple holes, and that's all you can ask for out here.   
 It's a tough course, great golf course. And pars are not going to kill you. You just have to hang on, and that's all I told myself. I didn't quite have that.   
  
  Q. How was the thumb?  
 PAULA CREAMER: No. The thumb was fine today, no pain. I'm going to go and ice it right now. That's the biggest thing, just ice, Advil and rest.   
  
  Q. Thanks. Appreciate it.
