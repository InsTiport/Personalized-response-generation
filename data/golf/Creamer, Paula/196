 Q. Paula, that was one heck of a match.
 PAULA CREAMER: It was awesome. She played that front nine so well. 
 I left her hanging a couple of times, but we closed really well. We finished strong, and a win is a win and my hands go down to Kerr today.

 Q. What about your putt on 16, though? 
 PAULA CREAMER: That was nice. It was good timing for us. It was a big putt. I saw Kerr's read, and I kind of went for it; and it went in. 

 Q. Cristie, you played great all day, but I noticed on the 12th it seems like you guys got the crowd involved. 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah. The 9th hole is so far out there, people don't want to walk out there. And as we got more near the clubhouse, we got more of a crowd. And that's what a team is all about. The holes I wasn't there, Paula was there. I was fortunate to make a lot of birdie putts today.

 Q. You girls were great. Well done. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Thank you.
 CRISTIE KERR: Thank you.

 Q. Cristie, how does it feel to come out on top of such an incredible match? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah. It was an amazing match. I could just kind of feel the momentum switching, and I told Paula, if we could hang in there, hang in there, make a putt at the right time, and then at 12 I made a great putt, and then they fought back at 13. And from there on in it was all us, so we played great. 

 Q. There always is a turning point and a key putt. It's gotta be yours at 16. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Yes and no. Kerr made some great putts out there that really helped us. 
 You know, that front nine I kept on telling Kerr, "This is all you, baby, this is all you." And then we finished strong. She made some good birdies, and I think the biggest thing was that birdie on 17. Just the momentum going into 18. It's a birdie hole, reachable for the long hitters; and we made birdie. 

 Q. How big a buzz is it to play in front of that sort of atmosphere?
 CRISTIE KERR: It's amazing. The crowds out here, I think they need to get a whole lot louder, but they were definitely in support of us, and it was great. 
 Paula's putt on 16 was amazing. I walked up to her saying, "I've seen you make some of these long putts," and damned if she did. So that kind of got me fired up. 
 She hit it close on 17, and I knew I was going to hit it right there. I just knew it. I got really within myself and hit a great shot, and then we were right there on 18.

 Q. Congratulations. Great effort. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Thank you.
 CRISTIE KERR: Thanks. 

 Q. The crowds have been a little bit subdued so far? 
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah. I think so. A little bit for the size of them. Maybe it's all the open spaces. But I think they'll get a little more fired up as the week goes on.

 Q. How did you handle Suzann's slow play today? Does that drive you nuts?
 PAULA CREAMER: She was a little bit slow today. But you know, it's four-ball. It's going to be slow, and they tucked every pin, which probably took us five hours and 40 minutes to play, which is not going to help the afternoon matches. 
 But that's just kind of the nature of it, especially when it's 25, 30-mile-an-hour wind, and they're tucking pins and you got four people on the golf course. We're all slow at times. It's just how it goes.

 Q. On 16 what did you see on the putt at 16?
 PAULA CREAMER: I got a good read from Cristie. I practiced it a lot in the practice rounds, but I hit a good putt and saw it going in. 
 Cristie was walking this way, I was walking this way. It was just a big putt at a big moment for us. It was huge.

 Q. How much break were you playing in that?
 PAULA CREAMER: 25 feet.

 Q. 25 feet of break? Wow. Did you hit through the fringe?
 PAULA CREAMER: Just inside.

 Q. Your target was just inside the fringe? What do you think, maybe a 50-foot putt?
 PAULA CREAMER: Probably about 45 feet.
