 Q.  5-under par today, your lowest round of the week.  You must be feeling good going into tomorrow's qualifier?  
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, I played well, actually, this whole week.  Yesterday it was so hard and I haven't -- my putts didn't fall yesterday.  That was kind of the main thing.  It was fun to be able to play in this wind.  The first couple days were like, this wasn't Scotland, but today I had six birdies and one bogey.  Played really solid and you know, try to keep it up tomorrow for my Monday qualifier.   
 Q.  You're probably one of the biggest names in the qualifier.  Do you think that adds any pressure?  
PAULA CREAMER: Last year that was the same situation, as well.  I played well and I got into the British.  I told myself I would never do that again but here we are in that same situation.  So at least now I've been there and I know what to expect a little bit.  It's hard not seeing the golf course, but we did it last year, so no reason why we can't do it again.   
 Q.  Do you quite relish the fight?  
PAULA CREAMER: Definitely, I always play better when it's a little tougher and you have to grind it out.  I wish I wasn't in this situation but at the same time we learn from everything and it will be exciting to see what happens.  Today I played really well and I can go into tomorrow with a good attitude and see what happens.
