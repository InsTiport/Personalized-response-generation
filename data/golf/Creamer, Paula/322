Q.  How did you feel about the day's match?
PAULA CREAMER: I hit the ball really well today and nothing really fell this afternoon, and kind of in the middle of my first round this morning I putted well and didn't really make anything, and it kind of carried on to the afternoon.

Juli and I are good partners and a good team, and we gave it our all.
Q.  It looks like you had a lot of camaraderie.
PAULA CREAMER: Definitely.  I mean, everybody is really getting along well, really supportive of everybody.  We all want the same thing.  There is nothing better than have having a team behind you.
Q.  This must be a great experience for you.
PAULA CREAMER: It is.  I mean, this has been unbelievable.  I'm having so much fun out here, and I'm playing good golf.  I'm hoping the putter gets hot for the next two days.
