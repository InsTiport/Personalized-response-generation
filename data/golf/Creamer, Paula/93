STACY LEWIS:   They rallied on the back nine.   They made a bunch of birdie putts and they made us make putts.   It was a great match.   It was back and forth all day.   We had six birdies.   We had to play some golf today.


PAULA CREAMER:   Definitely, we said it walking off the first tee, everybody was really into it.   I think I lost my voice while I've been out there.   But that's what we always say, what helps us so much out here is the crowds.
And they were so behind us.   We can't do it without them.   Hopefully they will be out there this afternoon too.
