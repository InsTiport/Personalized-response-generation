 Q. Disappointing day for you?
 PAULA CREAMER: I don't know. It was just not a good day for me. That's golf. That's sports in general. You look at your athlete, it's your body out there, and I just didn't feel comfortable. 
 I had a pretty good warm-up, but just when I got out here I just didn't feel real solid. 
 Didn't help that Beanie played great, and you have to go out there and being first off you're in the role to be a leader, but it didn't go this way today, but in the past it has.

 Q. Was it made more difficult by the fact that she never seemed to open the door for you at all? 
 PAULA CREAMER: Yes and no. I probably was pressing a little bit too hard. The birdie that she made on two from pretty far away kind of set the tone a bit. Then I missed a pretty good birdie opportunity on the next hole. 
 But like I said, that's golf, and we're a team. It's one match. I've played really with him this whole Solheim Cup. It's unfortunate this is singles day, but I was in some winning matches these last couple of days, and that's all I can really do. It's just not my day.

 Q. Looking at the boards, what are you going to do to support them? 
 PAULA CREAMER: I'm going to be the best cheerleader I can be. I've had a lot of the girls come out and follow me in the last several matches that I've played. I'm going to do the same thing and cheer them on. 
 That's why we're a team. That's why there are 12 girls out here. One person isn't going to make the team. It was an unfortunate day, but I think we're going to finish strong.
