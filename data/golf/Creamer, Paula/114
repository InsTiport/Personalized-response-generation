Q.   You got off to a great start today, how did the day unfold for you?
PAULA CREAMER:   I played well.   Obviously the last couple holes, I kind of struggled a little bit. 
But, geez, this is much more than what I ever expected, and to have a chance and really have a good chance to win this event, it felt good.   It was nice to be in contention and have just a good attitude out there.   I think that's the biggest thing that I take away from this week. 

Q.   And is there any particular moment in the back nine where you thought, it was just going to be so hard to catch Stacy? 
PAULA CREAMER:   No, I mean, this golf course, you have to hit some pretty demanding shots, and you're never far out of it.   I wish I could go back in time a couple times out there, but I putted really well, didn't make‑‑ I had some good, long efforts and they just didn't fall in.   Sometimes it's your day and sometimes it's not.

Q.   And all in all, to give yourself a chance after what happened at the start of the week, in the running and winning on Sunday‑‑
PAULA CREAMER:   Like I said, this is much more than what I even bargained for.   Didn't even know if I was going to tee it up, and taking a third after what Colin and I have been through, it's pretty good.   I'll take it.

Q.   Do you plan now to go home? 
PAULA CREAMER:   Go home.

Q.   And then go to Phoenix? 
PAULA CREAMER:   Phoenix to be my next event.   We'll see how everything is feeling with my neck and shoulder and go from there, one step at a time. 

Q.   Do you have someone that you see back at home? 
PAULA CREAMER:   Yes.
