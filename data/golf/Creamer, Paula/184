   PAULA CREAMER: No, I don't mind playing in bad weather. I actually probably prefer it more than good weather. Makes it, you know, harder for everybody. You have to come out and focus on -- you know, par is a good score.
 Yesterday was, you know, just a very bad day. So it was good to come out and play a good nine holes. I didn't finish, you know, putt out on 18, but I hit the ball really well. So I'll sleep a little better tonight than I did last night.

 Q. What you leave yourself with on 18 to start out in the morning?
 PAULA CREAMER: I'd say about a 30-footer or so. I have to come out anyway, so why not just be a 100% and see the green a little better. It got pretty dark fast.

 Q. I you know you talk about playing better in this type the weather, but what about the disruption and other players who don't have to play at all today and played in the nice mild conditions yesterday morning?
 PAULA CREAMER: We definitely got the short end the the stick with the draw, that's for sure. You look at it overall and kind the add them up here and there, and this is definitely one the those ones where the afternoon waves yesterday, we definitely didn't get the good times.
 But it is what it is, and we have a lot more golf left.

 Q. You hit that final nine tomorrow. For you anyway, is your game a little better feeling than it was yesterday? Are you feeling strong? 
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, I mean, definitely. Yesterday I had a couple bad holes. You know, overall I played pretty well. But, you know, just kind the got in my own way on some certain shots. 
 It was tough. It was very windy but still, not an excuse.
