  Q.  Kind of a roller coaster match, tough loss, can you just talk about how you played today?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Played okay in the beginning and then the middle kind of just fell apart.  Then, you know, I got a little help from her the last couple of holes and when I started putting pressure on her again.  She hits it so far.  And a lot of the holes today were playing pretty long; so it was like my 4-iron against her 9-iron, and that's kind of hard to do.   
    
  Q.  16 and 17, she was in the weeds and then in the bunker, do you kind of think maybe the pressure --   
 PAULA CREAMER:  I hit good shots.  I was right there waiting for that, and you know, it's funny how people react under pressure down the stretch.  You just have to remember every time you play match-play.
