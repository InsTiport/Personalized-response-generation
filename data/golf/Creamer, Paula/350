NBC INTERVIEWER:  If the children are our future, the future sure looks bright for women's golf.  Congratulations to both of your girls.  You are young for such a competition for low amateur at the U.S. Open Championship.  I sense a budding rivalry, is that the case?
PAULA CREAMER:  I don't think that.  We're very good friends.  I think on the golf course, we both want to beat each other, but I think that's natural.

MICHELLE WIE:  On the golf course we don't see each other, we just look at the leaderboard, and I have to beat her.  But off the golf course, we're really good friends, and I don't sense any kind of rivalry.  But on the golf course we want to beat each other.
Q.
You'll be seeing a lot of each other the next few decades.  This is good enough to come back and play in Cherry Hills next year.  You are automatically qualified as of right now.  And Michelle, that will be a nice change for you.  After the special exemptions, that were critics out there.

MICHELLE WIE:  There are always critics for everything, and next year I'm really glad that I played really good, that I got 13th, I feel good about my game.
Q.
I'd like to ask you both about your plans to turn professional.  Paula, you at the age of 17, what's the story?
PAULA CREAMER:  I'm not sure, I have one more year left of high school, so I'm definitely going to finish.  But I'm not sure, I haven't decided.  I've taken a couple of college visits, but we'll see what happens.
Q.
Michelle?

MICHELLE WIE:  I have three more years of high school, so I have more time.  But I definitely want to go to college.  I don't know when I'm going to turn professional, if I'm going to turn professional, I'm not sure.
Q.
The story hasn't changed for you as of yet.  Congratulations to you both.
