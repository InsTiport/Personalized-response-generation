 Q. How is your thumb doing?
 PAULA CREAMER: It was a little bit cold in the morning, so I was a little bit achy, but I plowed through it and tried to go out and just play. Hit it the least amount of times as I could. That was my plan. 

 Q. You gave away a couple of birdies on 17 and 18?
 PAULA CREAMER: I think I'm 1-over on 17 and 18, and you cannot do that on this golf course. That's where you make your birdies. That's where you make eagles, and I'm 1-over par, and it's unfortunate. 
 But other than that, I think I played really well, gave myself a lot of opportunities and made some good saves when I had to.

 Q. This championship must mean an awful lot to you, because I have a feeling that someone of less toughness might have withdrawn. 
 PAULA CREAMER: I hope nobody would withdraw. I mean that's what I would hope. As an athlete, you would want to be able to play in whatever conditions it gives you. 
 Unfortunately I'm in pain. I've been in pain for a while, but I've kind of proved to myself, too, that I can come out here and play good golf. 
 The fans here, honestly, they are amazing. I love coming over here, and I just wanted to be able to come out and play, and I was able to do it.

 Q. Lots of luck to you. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Thank you.
