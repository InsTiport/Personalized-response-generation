  Q. Can you just talk about your day?   
 PAULA CREAMER: It was pretty good overall. It was unfortunate the last couple of holes, a bogey. 18 was probably the worst.   
 But, I gave it a chance, and Michelle played great. I knew I had to go and shoot a round of 5- , 6-under to win. I wanted to be around maybe 13, and seems like that is what it would have taken.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the last putt on 18, severely downhill?   
 PAULA CREAMER: Every day I've hit it over this it green, or above the pin. So I'm kind of used to that downhill putt, but that's definitely not what you want when you need to make birdie.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about next week, still one more event left to get the win this year, and I know that's something you've really wanted.   
 PAULA CREAMER: I feel a lot better with the way my golf. It's just unfortunate that you're so close, yet you're so far away.
