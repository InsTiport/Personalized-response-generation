 Q.  We all know that this is the last week for points.  Do you let yourself think about that this week or do you kind of just focus on playing out the way you want to play?  
PAULA CREAMER: Of course it's on my mind.  It's been on my mind all year the moment I heard that Juli was the captain.  I've wanted to be on that team and make that team.  It doesn't mean that I'm going to step away from my routine.  I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself and just go out and play some golf.   
 Q.  Have you talked to Juli at all or have you kind of just focused on what you feel like you need to do?  
PAULA CREAMER: It's a hard situation.  She knows that I'm trying my hardest, and I know that she wants me to play as well as I can, but we never really sat down and talked about it.   
 Q.  Is it different for you this time?  I mean, have you ever been in this situation?  
PAULA CREAMER: No, never.  I've never been in this situation before.  I've been on five Solheim Cup teams and I've made my way on every one of them.  It is what it is.  I wish I would have played a little bit better, but I've been really working on things and trying to just get better in general.  I know I can do it.  There is no reason why I can't go on and play a good week.
