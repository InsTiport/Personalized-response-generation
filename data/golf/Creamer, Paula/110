 Q.   How did it go out there?  
PAULA CREAMER:   It went all right.   I mean, I gave myself a lot of chances.   Made two bogeys.   One was an errant drive, had to take an unplayable.   Then the next one was a three‑putt, which I thought I made a good putt, but just didn't make as many birdies as I would have liked.

It's a grinding golf course.   Mentally you are just kind of exhausted, especially because USGA does a good job with the tee boxes.   We are all over the map out here, and that's something that‑‑ I mean, how many tee shots did you hit in the practice rounds.   I think that's what makes it so much more difficult is you come out with a plan, but you are thrown a curve ball out there.
