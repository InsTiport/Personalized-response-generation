Q.  Paula, talk about your round today.
PAULA CREAMER:  Well, I just kind of got off to a bad start.  I lost the first hole.  It was poor course management on No. 1.  After that, I fought through until the end.  I always gave myself an opportunity.  I didn't really make any putts in the beginning.

But I saw her make some clutch and key putts in the end.  She played good today.  She played steady, she hit fairways and greens.  It was close all day long.  She made it tough.  She wasn't going to give up, and she is a true competitor.  She's a fantastic player.  It was to awesome to play with Karrie, and I hope she wins so I can say I lost to the winner.
Q.  Do you look forward to the event again next year?
PAULA CREAMER:  Of course, definitely.  I love match play.  Hamilton Farm has been so wonderful to everybody, especially to myself.
Q.  It was tough to play catch up?
PAULA CREAMER:  Yes, I got off to, as I said, a rough start with a bogey on the first hole, a careless bogey.  I got it back on one hole and then kind of gave it back to her.  And then I made a lot of birdies that she had to make on top of me.  I put pressure on her, as well, but I was always halving to make it so she wouldn't win the hole.
