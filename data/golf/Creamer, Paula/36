 Q.  How important was that eagle at 15 as you try to seek your first title in a couple of seasons?  
PAULA CREAMER: That was always nice to make a 25, 30-footer especially after the front nine that I had.  And it's good.  It was a good momentum swing for me, and I finished with a couple of birdies there, and hit some really good golf shots today.  Just didn't putt as well as I did yesterday for sure.   
 Q.  You're definitely in contention.  What will you work on after this round to try to get ready for tomorrow in what I'm sure will be another birdie fest?  
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah.  You know, it was kind of nice they switched some tees up for us, made the golf course play a little different, but you definitely know there's going to be a lot of birdies made.  And tomorrow I'm just going to go out and have that same game plan, starting strong and not let those bogeys creep in like I did today, a couple of 3-putts here and there, but overall I'm very pleased with the way I'm playing, and if this is my off day, I'll take it.
