  Q.  4-up, that's pretty good.   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah, I worked on my swing a lot this year so it was good to go out and play competitively.  I made some bogeys but I made some birdies.  It was kind of a pretty mellow day out there, just a lot of pars.  Giulia, she had some really good pars out there, but was just one of those things that I just played a little bit better.   
  
  Q.  What did you learn about your game today after working on it so much?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Just taking it to the course competitively and that confidence and knowing what I'm doing on the range is somewhat helping me.  I think that's the biggest thing is just putting it into play.   
  
  Q.  There's a lot of humidity out there today, fog early in the morning did that come into play at all?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah, the ball wasn't going as far as it normally did, and I was short on the first couple of holes, and then we started dialing it in after that.   
 You know, the humidity was, it played a big factor into the game of golf today.
