Q. (Inaudible.)
MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, Anna did great.  She was pretty much out there on her own today.  I don't know if Caroline helped her much on any of the holes.  She was 7- or 8-under on the 15 holes that we played.  I don't think she missed a shot.
But we certainly didn't give her much of a fight.  We didn't make enough birdies.  You've got to make more birdies and best balls than we did out there.  We left a few putts and just didn't play our best.
Q. Paula, from your perspective, what was the difference between the way you performed this morning and this afternoon?
PAULA CREAMER: It's a total different mentality.  You kind of have to get on your own energy in this way.  And I think that playing against Anna this afternoon, Caroline is a good player but Anna just played awesome.  We didn't give her much pressure, unfortunately.
But it's one match.  We have a couple more days.  It doesn't determine everything.  We had a good morning and I've got to remember that, as well.
