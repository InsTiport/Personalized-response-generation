   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all for coming in.  Paula Creamer, congratulations on your fifth LPGA I Tour win.  You had four birdies in the last five holes.  This is your second win in the last four LPGA events that you've played, and you're not even feeling well. 
 PAULA CREAMER:  No, I know. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  That's incredible.  Talk about everything that you just accomplished and the way you clinched the thing. 
 PAULA CREAMER:  What a day, first of all.  Started off making a good birdie on 1, a really long putt on 3 for birdie, and then was kind of in a drought for quite a while. 
 My next birdie was just on that Par 5, 14.  I kept trying to tell myself, Stay patient.  The putts are going to fall.  They're going to fall.  On 15 when she makes birdie and I make par and you're two shots back, I'm thinking, Putts got to fall pretty soon.  Only have three left. 
 But three holes have always been something that my dad and I have talked about, the last three holes.  Some people it's four; some people it's two.  For me it's the last three holes, and I finished strong today.  That's very exciting for me, for confidence.  It's good.  It's fun.  It's fun walking on 18. 

 Q.  So now you get to go to Canyon Ranch? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Can we go over your scorecard, please. 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Birdie on 1.  Driver, and then I hit 3-wood.  I was trying to lay up to about 50 yards, but I hit it really far.  I had about a 34 yard pitch and I hit it about twenty feet past the hole and I made that. 
 Birdie on 3.  Driver, 145 yards.  Hit a 7-iron right and the other swales I had to kind of putt up and over.  I don't know how far that was.  Probably maybe 35, 40 feet.  35 feet. 
 And then birdie on 14.  Driver, 3-wood to about 12 feet, and then I 2-putted.  I had about 210 to the hole. 
 Birdie on 16.  Probably about 185.  I hit a little 4 rescue to about 10, 12 feet. 
 Birdie on 17.  Driver and then 110 yards.  I hit a little wedge probably about twenty feet past the hole. 
 Birdie on 18.  164 yards, I think, and I hit a 6-iron to about 5 and a half, six feet. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Questions for Paula. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah.  It was -- I mean, it was a great finish, it really was.  Walking down 18, I mean, we had kind of in-between yardages, and I just knew I was excited and I went to 6-iron. 
 But just how everything kind of unfolded through the last five holes, there was a lot of birdies being made.  It was fun and exciting.  It was a great, great finish.  I'll always remember this finish.  I'll put that back in the memory banks for sure. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Oh, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I birdied, I believe, 16 -- I birdied -- well, Friday I birdied a lot coming down the stretch.  I don't remember like -- not consecutive.  I think I birdied like 14 -- or 15, 16, par 17 and birdied 18 there, and I won that by one. 
 But not the last three, not like this. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Oh, without a doubt.  I mean, this was my -- I went out and I won that tournament those last three holes.  I knew I had to make some the birdies on the stretch, and those were three good holes to make birdie on. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  We had to do it.  I mean, I had to kind of, you know, either you make -- exactly.  It was one of those you have to make that.  It's a big shot at a big time. 
 I knew that coming down the stretch, just that pressure and knowing if you want to win this golf tournament you have to make this putt. 
 Kind of took that momentum into 17 and made that one, and then into 18. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  No.  I mean, I was nervous, I mean, but I felt confident.  That's why you practice.  That's why I do my drills.  To feel that, there's nothing like that.  You know, when you practice and you try and make three in a row or whatever, the three, the last one and that putt is a little different, the nerves.  But it was good.  I felt confident over it. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Oh, on 15 tee or... 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  A lot happened on 15.  I mean, when I was on 14 green I thought I was going to make that eagle putt and then I left it short.  I thought that was going to be a big swing there for me momentum-wise. 
 And this it kind of switched because she made birdie.  I guess we just kind of misclubbed, because I thought that 9-iron that I hit was in the hole and it came up 15 yards short. 
 No, I mean, I knew it was too early.  There was so much more golf left that I didn't even think about being in a playoff or anything like that. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Without a doubt.  Oh, definitely. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  I know.  I better live here or something.  Who knows.  No, I just I guess I like Hawaii.  This is the kind of the grass I practice on and that kind of thing, so maybe it's the confidence-wise.  But I don't know, I like it here. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  No, I'm ready for that flight tomorrow to Singapore.  I'm going to be awake the whole time. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Right.  Well, I kind of found my putting stroke on that hole.  That was big just for my confidence.  My putts weren't very aggressive.  They were just -- they were great putts, but just not my normal kind of back-of-the-hole putting stroke. 
 That hole was straight uphill a little left to right, but you had to be aggressive.  That was a good putt to make for confidence. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Seven, eight, nine, ten, yes. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
PAULA CREAMER:  I don't feel anything right now.  No, this morning I felt a lot better than I did yesterday morning.  It's starting to kind of come out, that kind of thing, so I'm on the way, on the mend. 
 But I feel a little better.  It's just one of those things that the doctor says will take about two weeks to get 100% recovered. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Oh, Friday night was when I got sick, and then Saturday was a rough day.  Sunday and Monday were probably the worst days of the bunch. 
 No, I couldn't even move on Sunday.  Monday I did a little bit of practice; Tuesday I did a clinic and I played on Tuesday, and then the Pro-Am.  But Sunday and Monday were pretty hard for me, those two days. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Well, I mean, yeah, stress helps, but being sick takes a really tough toll on your body, especially how hot it was the last couple days.  But I do, I feel better. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Well, ball striking-wise that was a very good thing for me.  Like I said the other day, I've been working on a lot of things with my golf, and that was kind of a free day to go out and kind of under-the-gun practice and take what you take from the range to the course. 
 But I did, especially when I got sick because I wasn't able to play Sunday and Monday.  I did, I took that momentum into this tournament. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  JJ, I mean, I had to win it.  I had to go out and play good, because she made a lot of good shots.  Constantly we both were making a lot of pars.  Nobody for a while was really doing much.  Everybody was kind of coming up from behind. 
 But she did, she played good.  Like I said, I had to go out and I had to win it the last three holes. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  I don't know, just it's pink.  Most of our adidas shorts never had belt loops and now we do, so it's exciting to wear on my belt that I have.  I got this at Kraft a couple years ago.  I think this is like the second time I've ever worn it. 
 But I've been saving it, and I think I saved it for a good day. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  The pink hat you mean?  Well, pink hat, that's our thing, last two groups on Sunday.  He doesn't -- yeah, he likes it, I think, secretly.  That means we're in the hunt, in contention. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Well, he's doing what makes me happy I guess, right?  He is. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 PAULA CREAMER:  No, uh-uh.  I like it.  I think it's kind of -- we always Bridgestone, we always said -- I told them that we were going to play a pink ball, and they came out with all these shades.  They were pretty light. 
 I said, If we're going a pink ball, we're going pink.  This thing, it's awesome.  I like it.  No one is out there with pink ball. 
 But I practice with it at home and I can see it.  Colin will always, Do you see it?  Oh, yeah, I see it.  We always say, You see pinky?  And if pinky is okay, then we're fine. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all.  Congratulations. 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Thank you very much.
