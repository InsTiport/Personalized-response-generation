 Q.  You nearly holed out on 18.  
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, that was a nice little chip shot that I had there.  I hit a lot of really good shots.  Got some weird bounces on the greens today.  But made a lot of birdies.  Just too many bogeys.  But there's still a lot of golf left.   
 Q.  The front nine, three consecutive birdies.  It was all starting very well.  
PAULA CREAMER: It was.  I've been working really hard on my game.  I'm super excited to be here.  I love Singapore and HSBC does such a great event for us, and bringing us all here, we have the best players in the world.  It's fun to go against them.  It's a new golf course and everybody's learning new tricks every day that we go on.   
 Q.  You've been busy off the golf course, as well, in dazzling, sparkly dresses.  
PAULA CREAMER: I mean, who doesn't like to wear sparkles, right?  Those are always nice things to be able to do, with the other girls, as well, and it was a great dinner that we went to on Tuesday night.  But it's been pretty busy but it's definitely worth it and being here and playing.   
 Q.  We follow you on social media on Instagram and we see how hard you're working with Gary, when you can get a lesson, because he's getting busier and busier, but it's really paying off.  
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, Gary and I have definitely worked very hard this off-season.  I was not pleased with the way I played last year.  But I made a lot of changes and we knew that, and going into this off-season, we knew that it was going to be a grind.   
I feel really good.  I'm so much stronger.  I changed my workouts, and my trainer and Chuck and I have been working really hard in the gym, as well.  It's all kind of just coming together.  I spend so much time with my family and my little niece now; I feel very relaxed, even though how hard I worked.
