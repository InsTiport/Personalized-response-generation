 Q.  Third-place finish.  How did you feel it went for you today?  Difficult conditions? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah, it was an up-and-down day with the on-and-off-again rain, but I never really got any momentum.  I did on 8 and 9, and then 10 was kind of the killer for me, hit it to 20 feet and three-putted and then never really recovered after that. 
 But Lorena played awesome; what are you going to do?  This was her tournament, her golf course, and it was nice to be able have played with her, too, the four days. 

 Q.  Fantastic to have a win last week and now come back here and finish third.  I mean, it's looking strong for the season ahead. 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah, I mean, I feel really good and really confident with everything.  It's nice to be able to go home and work on some things.  But I'm ready for the season to start, the big chunks of it, the majors and all.  This was a good tune-up. 

 Q.  An HSBC Women's Champions first event, what were your thoughts? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  It was by far one of our top tournaments that we have, and it's great to be able to come to Singapore, and it's even better to have come and have played well in front of everybody, and HSBC did a wonderful job. 

 Q.  How do you feel about Lorena and her first event of the year coming and winning by 11 stroke? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Like I said, it was her golf course.  We have no idea what course she was playing out here, but she played great, and it's hands down.  She only had a couple bogeys in four days, and that's where it all came down to.  I had more bogeys and not enough birdies. 

 Q.  And the weather, what did you think of it today? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Well, I mean, we can't control the weather.  It's difficult to be able to be off and on again.  But it's the same for everybody out there, and you just kind of have to grind through it.
