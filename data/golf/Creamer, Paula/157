 Q. Talk to me a little bit about today and how tough it was to get a couple rounds in. 
 PAULA CREAMER: It was a lot of golf. Tough golf course to walk. It takes a lot out of you playing I think 34 holes we had. 
 But that's the way it is. And, you know, 6 it's like it is. Go out there and do as much as you can. Played pretty solid and had a lot of great shots, especially the second round. 
 I have a really good swing thought going on in my head right now, and just try to keep it going.

 Q. Good. I know you have two to finish tomorrow and another round. Mentally how do you prepare to finish and start and finish and start?
 PAULA CREAMER: I have to do it. You have no other choice. I have two holes tomorrow to play. So try to go out and finish strong with those two holes and go back and relax and see how many holes I can get in tomorrow.
