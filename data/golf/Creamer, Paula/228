   JASON TAYLOR: Paula, thanks for coming in. Fresh off a pretty good week last week picking up win no. 4. Just talk about that and being here at Longs Drugs.   
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, obviously last week was quite the week. You know, I'll take a win, especially with that field. I played well pretty much all week. You know, I just hit my irons really well. I've been practicing out here. The last two days have been pretty exhausting.   
 I'm ready for this tournament to start. The golf course is in pretty good shape. The greens are kind of slow and a little bit bumpy. Hopefully by Saturday, Sunday they can get a lot quicker.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Well, you know, that's the -- I guess the beauty about golf. There's always another week right afterwards. I've always wanted to do back-to-back wins, and hopefully I can do that this week. I'm focused on winning and I'm focused on playing at my best. We'll see what happens.   
 As long as I give myself a chance to win on Sunday, that's all I can ask for.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: I mean, I've kind of gotten over the fact that I won. Unfortunately you only get a day to really enjoy it. But it is, it's another tournament. I have to come here and I have to be focused. I have to know that this is another big event here.   
 I'd love to do well here and I'd love to win this event, especially now that we're a little closer to Pleasanton. I said it last week, I've always wanted to win in my hometown, and this is basically my hometown.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Well, winning last week kind of helps that. I feel a little bit at ease even more when I walk out on this golf course just feeling that I have won and there's no reason why I can't win again.   
 I'm playing really well and putting well and hitting a lot of greens and hitting a lot of fairways. We'll just, like I said, just see what happens these next four days. Hopefully I can put four good rounds of golf together.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: I went to a birthday party. I don't know. I don't know, how is he related?   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, but he would be like my step uncle, I guess. So my step uncle. So I went to his 60th birthday party. Was it. Went there and then came back home and got a goodnight's rest and woke up and did my work out like I normally do and went out for my round of golf.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Well, I'm going to take a break after my last tournament that I play this year. I'll take a nice couple weeks off, maybe do a vacation without my golf clubs. Most people's vacations involve playing golf courses, but mine, they stay in the garage.   
 I would like to just kind of relax and really look at what I want to do for the next year goals-wise, and then work really hard on my golf swing and then in the gym. Those are my two main goals. You know, working a lot with my driver golf swing.   
 You have your driver swing and then you have your iron swing, and my main focus next year will be hitting the ball up, you know, on the way up with my driver.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Not necessarily a timeline. Obviously if I -- I thought coming out when I was 18 it was my goal just to keep coming and coming. There's a lot of work that you have to put into it, and I think that I've been gradually -- these last couple of years have been stepping up the ladder to it.  
 I just have to keep working hard. It's all a matter of timing. I don't really want to just get there, I want to stay there. There's a difference of becoming the No. 1 player in the world for a brief amount of time. I want to stay there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Yes. Well, that was a big week. A lot happened that week with that and the Money List. To just -- yes, I do pay attention to that. I was quite pleased with the jump that we made. But it's just like you say, you jsut keep getting closer to it. I think I have one, two, three -- six tournaments left, so I'm going to try to keep gaining on her.   
 That's all I can really do, is try and play well these couple tournaments left.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: I mean, my goals, that's what keeps everything going. There's so much that I want to do. I love the game and I love what it throws at me every week. It seems like, you know, I learn something every round out on the golf course.   
 Momentum is all confidence. The more confidence that I have I feel the better I play. That's true in any case with anybody. The higher your confidence level is, you can just them, the way they walk, things like that. Those are the players that play well.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, uh-huh. Well, last week it was all about hitting fairways and hitting it in the right parts of the greens.   
 Here, the rough is definitely not as punishing. But still, the greens are -- they're pretty firm for how slow they are when you putt. But I think it just all comes down to being smart and being aggressive when you need to.   
 It's a little bit drier in some cases. You know, the rough, like last year, a perfect example, No. 3, the par-5. You hit it down the right side and you possibly could stay up on the hill.   
 Now it's just like a trampoline almost. Just things like that have changed. I just think that irons here are a big -- you to have a big premium on being precise with your yardages.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: I mean, I played here the last several years, and the fans here are phenomenal. So many people come out and watch, and it's a great event. The golf course, it's a tricky golf course. Most players don't like it. You got to go out and think your way around and play some good golf or it'll kind of eat you alive.   
 But being a hometown girl, it would be very disappointing to see it leave or no longer have it. I love coming home and I love playing in front of people. I think where we get great crowds is where we should have our events, and if it leaves I think that would be very disappointing.   
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. Thanks so much.   
 PAULA CREAMER: Thank you.
