 Q.  Paula, I guess you felt like you left a few out there today? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  I did.  I hit the ball really good today.  I had a lot of 10, 15-footers, pretty much all throughout the back nine.  It's just unfortunate I couldn't make more of them. 
 But, I put myself in contention with a good front nine.  But 4-under today is not bad on Sunday. 

 Q.  Do you still sit and watch and wait and maybe hope they come back a few? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Oh, I'm pretty sure that they are going to -- Karrie is in there, Suzann, they are pretty much going to hold it off. 
 Like I said, as long as I keep giving myself chances and opportunities, that's all you can ask for. 

 Q.  Another major, so do you gain some experience from playing on the weekend? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  Of course.  The more I'm out on Sunday in the later part of the tee times, the more I can take into my golf game.  I made enough birdies to win the tournament, but it's just those bogeys that creep in once in awhile.
