  Q. So 8-under through 36 holes, give us some thoughts on your round today?   
 PAULA CREAMER: I'm giving myself a bunch of chances out there. I missed three birdies today, which I'm trying not to miss as many. These greens are pretty big, so when you do miss it, it's kind of an errant shot.   
 I gave myself lots of opportunities and made some good putts.  
  
  Q. Through six holes, give us your thoughts on this golf course? How does it suit your game?   
 PAULA CREAMER: You can make a lot of birdies out here, that's for sure. Every day you should be 4 or 5-under, especially going into the weekend. It's a good place to be.   
 I'm sure the pin placements are going to be tougher because there are so many birdies being made, but we'll see.  
  
  Q. Now 3 back right now going into the weekend. Give us your thoughts. Are you going to change anything going in?   
 PAULA CREAMER: No, I feel good. I'll keep everything going the way it has been. Working hard on my golf swing, so I'll try to keep that up. Go hit some balls this afternoon, and see what happens.
