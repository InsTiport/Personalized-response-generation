Q. On moving Saturday, obviously 2-over is not what you were looking for.  What was going on out there?PAULA CREAMER: You know, I just had two bogeys and that's it.  I was unfortunate with every opportunity that I did have for birdie.  I never capitalized on it.
Q. Going into tomorrow, what is your mindset?PAULA CREAMER: Just to keep playing the way I've been playing, instead I just needed to capitalize on a couple more putts today.  But I made a lot of really good up-and-downs.  I can't be too upset with myself.  It's just unfortunate when I did have those opportunities I didn't take advantage on both of the par-5s, 5 and 10, right, pin-high, and walked with away with par on both of them.
