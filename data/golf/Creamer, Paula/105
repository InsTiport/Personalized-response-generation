  PAULA CREAMER:   I'm just trying to continue how I've been playing and make some more putts.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel you built up some momentum?   You played very well on the back nine, your first nine.   
PAULA CREAMER:   I did.   I honestly played very well all day, very consistent.   Missed a couple coming down the stretch.  
But at the same time, just kept giving myself some opportunities.   It's hot out here.   Plays a little bit different than that has.   The golf course is starting to dry up on some of the tee shots, so you have to be aware of that coming into the weekend.  
Hopefully I can have a good day tomorrow and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Was the heat and humidity a problem?   
PAULA CREAMER:   It's very hot out there.   You're drinking as much as you can, eating as much as you possibly can.   
You know, bigger for the spectators.   We kind of know what it's like to travel week in and week out in this heat.   It's important to keep up with your fluids.
