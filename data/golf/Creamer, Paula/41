 Q.  It was a battle.  Very tough.  Did you see where the momentum changed?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, the momentum changed on, what is it, the par-3, 15, when she almost had a hole-in-one.  We were in control of the match through 11.  They made birdie on 12.  But still had a good chance on 13 and 14.   
But 15 was really -- they birdied the last four holes.  Birdieing the last four holes in singles play, in any kind of play, is very good, let alone in alternate shots.  And they hit great shots and made the putts.  The last four holes hurt.   
 Q.  Made some great shots?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, we played well.  We didn't have a bogey today, I don't think.  The par-3, the fifth hole.   
PAULA CREAMER: But other than that, we were totally in control for a long time.  We could both sit here and say we could have done this, we could have done that, but they played well and they finished strong and that's all you can say.   
 Q.  What's the plan, to go out and cheer?  Relax?  
PAULA CREAMER: Go out and practice, cheer on.   
MORGAN PRESSEL: Go watch the first tee and then rest and go back out.
