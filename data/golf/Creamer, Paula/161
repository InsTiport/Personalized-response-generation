   PAULA CREAMER: I was 2-over through six holes for the day and 3-under for the tournament, and I made a good par save on the par-3, 5, and after that I kind of just started chucking along, birdied 8 and 9, gave myself a good look on the rest of the holes on the back nine. You know, I made some good putts and kept giving myself opportunities. 

 Q. With Angela so far out at the beginning of the day, did you sort of know that you had to kind of go out there and post a number?
 PAULA CREAMER: No. I knew that. I thought if you were five or six behind, you know, you always have a chance if you go out and shoot low. 
 I wasn't too far in front of her with the groups, so I knew if I could kind of go low, but it makes it kind of a fun day. You can pretty much go at everything, you have nothing to lose.
