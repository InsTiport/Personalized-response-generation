  Q. You strike me as a person who would love to go off first with that extra responsibility.  
 PAULA CREAMER: You know, I've always told Beth, if you need me, I'm going to be right there. I've told every captain I've ever had. She's done an amazing job with our lineup. And sending me out first and Angela right behind me and then Michelle, it's a strong first pairing; and my one goal was to get the first point, and I did that.   
  
  Q. You played really well the Back 9 as well.   
 PAULA CREAMER: I did. There was a lot of great drama going on. We had putts on top of each other, great par saves by Suzann. Just the whole thing. It was a great match.   
 I played really well and put the pressure on her all day long.
