 Q. So you kind of underestimated the preparation maybe?
 PAULA CREAMER: Yes and no. I still prepare the same way I would any tournament. I just didn't come out and play it as much as I should have.

 Q. There's one former Player of the Year in this field, Laura Dave he's. 
 PAULA CREAMER: I did not know that. That's interesting.
