Q. So what was your thoughts on the first match you had today?
PAULA CREAMER: I mean, we grinded out there.  They played so steady, and we had a bunch of birdies and a couple of bogeys.  But made some awesome putts, and with Austin being her first match out here, and she knows what to expect now and she played great.  She really did.  She came in when she needed to and as a team, I loved her as a partner.  I know we lost, but we played a really, really strong team.
Q. What about the atmosphere out here?
PAULA CREAMER: It's great.  It's pretty awesome.  Every hole, there's tons of people and we just want them to be a little bit louder if they can, especially in that midway, kind of, your round because everybody starts off strong.  We all want to finish strong, too.
Q. Austin, what's the first experience like for you out here at Solheim Cup?
AUSTIN ERNST: It was awesome.  The first tee was great.  Obviously we would have wanted to win.  But we played pretty solidly.  They played really, really good this morning.
