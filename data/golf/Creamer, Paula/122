 Q.   You started off really well on the back nine, what was the key?   
PAULA CREAMER:   I played really well all day.   I just had seven 3‑putts or something.   But I think just like I said, I hit a lot of great shots, and I just couldn't really 2‑putt out there.   I missed a lot of short putts, even birdie opportunities, and that was the difference of being a great round and shooting 1‑over.   
   
 Q.   So the conditions were quite tricky but not as tough as they could be; how would you assess them?  
PAULA CREAMER:   No, I wouldn't say that for sure.   It was kind of windy early on and then designed of died and then came back to being a little bit windy.   Like I said, a little bit hard on myself, because I did play so much better than shooting 1‑over in these conditions.  
   
 Q.   You came very close to winning Monday; do you feel like that is going to set you off or affect anything?   
PAULA CREAMER:   No, I play in a lot of tournaments, that kind of thing.   It's just something that happened unfortunately but I still was in a playoff and had a chance to do well and that's all I can really take from.   I hit the ball great.   I putted really well that week and try and do it again this week.
