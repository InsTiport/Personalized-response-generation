 Q.  5-under par.  How important is experience on this golf course?  
PAULA CREAMER: A lot of the local knowledge for sure comes around here.  Just sticking with your game plan.  It's a relatively short golf course from what we normally play, so puts a premium on hitting fairways and good wedges.   
The thing that makes it tough is the wind.  Yesterday was a completely opposite direction than today.  You got to be aware of that, and on some of the holes par is a great score.   
 Q.  It's been I think three years since your last win, and also currently outside the number looking in for the Solheim Cup, which means so much to you.  Which one is a greater motivating factor or does one take care of the other?  
PAULA CREAMER: Oh, well, winning, for sure.  I know my game is coming around, and I've felt really positive and very strong on the way it is.  It's just a couple holes out there every once in a while get me.   
You know, I can be on the Solheim Cup team if I win, so I feel like if I take care of that first the latter will happen.
