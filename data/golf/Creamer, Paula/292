  Q.  How do you feel today?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  It's good.  I mean, it's a Major.  The golf course, when you're hitting long shots, is doing well.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding the lengthening of the course.)   
 PAULA CREAMER:  I was thinking about that, and definitely you can make birdies, but you have to be patient, and you just kind of -- you have to be patient.   
  
  Q.  How about your short game?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  The shorter putts didn't seem to break very well, and I kind of got confused out there, but I'm definitely going to be working on the putting game.   
  
  Q.  Is the rough thicker than last year?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  It's patchy in certain areas, and around the green, if you miss it just off the fairway, it's not great.  It's kind of patchy.   
  
  Q.  Paula, you made some good putts.   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yeah, I made some, I made some safe putts.   
  
  Q.  Paula, you've been candid about wanting to be number one.  What do you think about that?  Annika was within reach and --   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Well, I think everybody's game had stepped up.  The TOUR in general, everybody is starting to play better.  We've played four tournaments, and I think it's exciting.  Annika is always going to play well, and a lot of people are playing well.  It's up for anybody.   
  
  Q.  When you look at the field, how do you feel about it?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Whenever you play the field, you're looking at everybody.  I love Annika, and I love playing her, but you're not playing one person; you're playing the golf course, and that's what you have to realize.   
 Annika set the bar, and I think it's a matter of time before it gets moved up.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 PAULA CREAMER:  It's true, it's true.  (Chuckles.)   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 PAULA CREAMER:  That's good for me to know.  If she can do it, there is no reason why I can't.  Stacy won this year, I've won this year, Lorie has won.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel this year?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  I feel confident out there.  My putting comes and goes; it was better last week in Arizona.  When you are in a Major, you have to have -- you have to be patient and putt well, and I feel like it's a matter of time.
