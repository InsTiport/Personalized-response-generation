Q.  Paula Creamer, if we had to pick an individual, it's you, Paula Creamer.  You laid it down in the press conference, you picked the victor.  You did your share today in great fashion.  Your team did as well.
PAULA CREAMER:  I'm so proud of the team and myself and Nancy and everybody.  This has been such an exciting week and what an exciting day.

To play good golf and play against Laura Davies and come out and watch all the other players, it's been    I have so much energy, but at the same time, it's emotionally draining.
Q.  I have to ask you a question.  Somebody just asked in the gallery, have you thought of how many of these you will be playing in in your career?
PAULA CREAMER:  I hope many, many, many.  This is a week I will never forget.  It's such an experience.  Not only to be on a winning team, but have the 12 members that are now incredibly close to my heart, especially Nancy and Donna.  This has been a week    like I said, I have no words to describe it.  It's been unbelievable.
Q.  It must be surreal, I'm sure.  Congratulations to you and your entire team.
PAULA CREAMER:  Thank you very much.
