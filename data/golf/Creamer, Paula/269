  Q.  Pretty much you guys played pretty well today.  Happy?   
 JULI INKSTER:  We did.  We hit a lot of fairways and greens.  We had a lot of long putts for par, but we knew going out that pars are going to be good on alternate shot.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel playing together?   
 JULI INKSTER:  I didn't like it much.   
  
  Q.  You had trouble with this one.   
 JULI INKSTER:  We were very comfortable with each other.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you'll be playing again?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Captains.  We have a lot of momentum, but at the same time, we have to do what we have to do for the team.   
  
  Q.  How did you feel about the crowds?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  They were great.
