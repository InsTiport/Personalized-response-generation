   PAULA CREAMER: I played pretty solid. I had several three putts, but I made several birdies also. You know, it's out there. You can definitely shoot a good score. It's just eliminating those bogeys.   
 I don't think I missed - maybe one green I missed all day, but I just had some three-putts.  
  
  Q. How did it feel to finally start playing again after the delay yesterday?   
 PAULA CREAMER: No, it was great. I mean, the buildup's been a lot this whole week, you know, just constantly playing practice rounds. Yesterday was tough not being able to play.   
 But that's Mother Nature, and you can't control that. You know, it's going to be a long day today. I'm just trying to conserve as much energy as I can, and hopefully I can put up a good number this afternoon.  
  
  Q. Do you do anything special when you do have to now go back to back?  
 PAULA CREAMER: No, just sit down for a little while, eat some food, and then get back out there. The more you think I guess the more it will play a part of it.   
 It is what it is. It's unfortunate, but just have to do it.
