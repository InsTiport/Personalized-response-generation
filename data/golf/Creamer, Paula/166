 Q. How are you feeling?
 PAULA CREAMER: I'm exhausted. I haven't been sick since last night. But it was tough. I was pretty weak, but tried to come out and just get through one more day of golf. 
 You could see the last five holes or so I was struggling, just not enough energy, and that's going to be expected.

 Q. Did you have a diagnosis finally?
 PAULA CREAMER: They said it was that 24-hour bug. Food poisoning would already have kind of come and gone. But my dad's still really sick, so between the two of us we're not doing so good, but at least I could make it out here.

 Q. Do you have any positive memories of being here?
 PAULA CREAMER: I did. The fans out here, gosh, they were great. I can't say enough about them. It was a great week. You know, you can't -- people get sick. People can get sick anywhere and that's not because of Winnipeg.

 Q. People get sick, they don't shoot par or under par, though?
 PAULA CREAMER: Well, you know, I guess you gotta fight through it.

 Q. Thanks, Paula. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Thank you.
