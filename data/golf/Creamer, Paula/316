Q.  The more the pressure, the better you play.  That was incredible, even by your standards.  You proved it today.
PAULA CREAMER:  Thank you.  I played good golf today.  Like I said, Laura is an absolutely great player.  She's here and she's great.  She's one of the top players on the European Tour, and going against her, you have to play well.

And going into today, I was hitting the ball well and putts went in, so that was great.
Q.  The youngest player in Solheim history playing the most experienced player in Solheim history.  Is it the greatest achievement you've achieved so far in a short professional career, admittedly?
PAULA CREAMER:  This is a huge feat for me, and definitely playing with Laura, and playing the Solheim Cup, it was one of my goals to get here, and when I got here, I wanted to win.  So far, it's been good, but there is still lots of golf left.
Q.  You never want to miss one there, do you?
PAULA CREAMER:   No.  You know, this is an unbelievable experience.  It's been a great week, and to be here with all those fans, it's even better.
Q.  Great play.  Very well done.
