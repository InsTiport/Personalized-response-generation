 Q. Do you look forward to playing on Lorena's home course in November?
 PAULA CREAMER: I played last year and the course was great. They did a wonderful job setting up the tournament and I'm looking forward to going back.

 Q. What are your best memories or favorite parts of the tournament from last year?
 PAULA CREAMER: Just the golf course was really nice. There was a lot of people out there that came out to watch. But you know, just being able to go to Lorena's hometown is pretty cool.
