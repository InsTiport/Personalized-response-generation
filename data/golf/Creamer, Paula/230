  Q. You had a couple of good saves there on the back 9. A little bit of nerves on those holes?  
 PAULA CREAMER: No, I hit the ball really well all day long. I just couldn't putt very well. I kind of made the putts when I had to and I gave myself plenty of opportunities to go as low as I could.   
 Tomorrow's another day and we'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. You have your grandfather here.   
 PAULA CREAMER: Uh-huh, of course it's great to have him out here and watch and be a part of it because he's been such an inspiration in my life. To have him out here and watch means a lot to me. It's pretty special.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: I'm going to need some help, that's for sure. But you never know. Stranger things have happened. If I get my putter rolling, who knows.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 PAULA CREAMER: You know, I think when I got into trouble I managed to get out, you know, reasonably.   
 I didn't make many mistakes except a couple iron shots down the stretch when I still got up and up and down, but I think that was maybe a little bit fatigue.
