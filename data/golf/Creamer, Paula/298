Q.
Talk about your round a little bit.
PAULA CREAMER:  I played pretty solid all day.  I hit really good iron shots.  Worked on the driver quite a while and worked on my golf swing, came out, I changed my pre shot routine a little bit to help.  You know, just like I said, gave myself a lot of chances.
Q.  How was it playing against the defending champion from last year?
PAULA CREAMER:  I knew it was going to be a good match and I knew that if I played the way did I yesterday, I wouldn't have done very well.  You know, just one of these things those.
Q.  Looking toward to tomorrow?
PAULA CREAMER:  I am.
Q.  Any plans?
PAULA CREAMER:  No, I'm going to go to the driving range, do my drills and then I'm going to get off my feet.
Q.  Can you compare this so the Solheim Cup from last year?
PAULA CREAMER:  I think being in a pressure situation like Solheim Cup, it helps a lot to be able to come out and play matches.  You know, you're going to have hopefully 36 holes tomorrow.
