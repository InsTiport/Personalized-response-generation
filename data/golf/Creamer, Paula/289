  Q.  Yesterday and today?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Just hit more fairways.  Yesterday gave myself better chances.  I think I missed about six greens.  I never got up and down once.  I think that was the biggest thing.   
  
  Q.  Can you think about some difficult holes on this round that made the biggest difference for you?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  First hole I hit a good drive, bounced (indiscernible) and second hole, and it's not that there's one hole.  Things were just not going my way.  I tried to stay patient but you can only do so much.   
  
  Q.  You talked a lot about patience yesterday.  Did you walk away from this major still feeling the same way?   
 PAULA CREAMER:  Yes, I do.  I feel that I played well.  And today I don't know what happened.  It's just not my day, that's for sure.  You have your good days.  You have your bad days.  Today was just not my day.
