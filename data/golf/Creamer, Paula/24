Q. 10-under early in the week.  Just how do you assess what happened?
PAULA CREAMER: Well, you can't shoot over par on Sunday, that's for sure.  The lead group, I mean, were we were on the clock for four holes.  That's just not going to cut it.  That's unfortunate, because I said early on to the girls we got to try to keep up.  I know we're getting behind.  But for four holes, that's a long time.
We just couldn't get a rhythm.  And especially with some of these pins and with the wind and everything, it's all happening so fast and you kind of can't regroup.  I didn't do a very good job of that.
But you know, I fought hard.  I kept grinding away out there.  Just really wasn't -- didn't execute any good shots in the middle of my round, which kind of hurt me.
Q. What do you think put you guys on the clock?
PAULA CREAMER: After 11 tee shot, so my bunker shot was our first one on the clock.  So 11, 12, 13, 14, and then 15 we were off the clock.
Q. Positives?  Any at all?  Being in contention?
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, of course.  I mean, any time you get to play in the last group that's obviously a good thing.  I just couldn't get the speed down early on with my putter.  Definitely a lot slower today than yesterday and I just couldn't figure it out.
You know, I should have been able to see that a little bit better.  I hit a lot of good-quality shots; I hit a lot of poor-quality shots, too.  It's balanced out in that sense.
