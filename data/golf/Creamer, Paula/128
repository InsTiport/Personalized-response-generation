Q.   4‑under par today.   Nice way to start the week.   Just talk about how you played. 
PAULA CREAMER:   I played pretty solid.   Made some good putts, made a couple good up‑and‑downs.   Been kind of the difference of my round today and the past couple months.   The back is just making some putts, so it's nice.

Q.   Talk about the reception we get here.   Obviously Evian, they do it right.   Great event, great crowds here. 
PAULA CREAMER:   No, I mean, they love women's golf and it shows.   They do such a good job of hosting us.   And the fans, they've been pretty incredible over the year.
It will be interesting to see it as a major next year.   But we have this year to play, and looking forward to the next three days.

Q.   Quick thought on Stacy's seven birdies in a row.   You don't see that every day. 
PAULA CREAMER:   No.

Q.   How did she play today? 
PAULA CREAMER:   She played awesome.   Honestly it was fun to watch.   First day and you're out there and shoots 9‑under.   That's a pretty incredible score on any golf course, and especially this one with all the little breaks.   It was impressive.
