PAULA CREAMER:  Pretty much every day except for last night.  I think the golf course is in great shape.  It is such a good test of golf.  4 under right now is leading.  That's not very much.
Q.  You won this tournament last year.
PAULA CREAMER:  What are you going to do?  I came out and expected to win.  I put the ball in the hole a couple of times, but I just didn't do it as much as I should have.
Q.  How were the conditions today?  Did you think you would get aggressive and make up ground?
PAULA CREAMER:  There were a couple of holes out there that you couldn't go for.  You had to hit in the middle of the green.  Overall I played pretty aggressive today.  I started off really good.  I had a couple of bogeys in a row.  Other than that, I played pretty solid.  My putter fail me.
Q.  How is this course?  Is the rough nice and high?
PAULA CREAMER:  Yes.  When you hit in the rough, you're dead.  It's one of those things where you can't    you have to take your medicine and move on.
Q.  Did 18 get a lot longer when you came over that hill?
PAULA CREAMER:  It did.  I hit my driver in the rough.  It didn't really matter much.  I was just trying to make par, give myself a look at birdie.  Like I said, it's one of those things.
Q.  Would it be sad to see maybe the tournament not be here next year, if they moved it?
PAULA CREAMER:  It would.  It's a great golf course.  You have to hit the golf ball in the right place out here and you have to play good golf.  It's a good test of golf.  It's rough conditions.  The rough is thick and the greens are pretty quick.  I would miss it if it wasn't here.  I like these kind of courses.
