Q. So heading to work out some kinks on the putting green right now?
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, sometimes rain delays get you, sometimes they don't.  Unfortunately this time it got me.  I've been playing really well.  It's unfortunate obviously, but today is not Sunday.  Today is Friday.
Q. Absolutely.  You're still well in this tournament.  How do you turn it around going into tomorrow?
PAULA CREAMER: Get a good night's sleep.  Obviously it's going to be kind of not the best of weather the next two days.  Yeah, just kind of get a good feeling going into the weekend.
That's golf.  Unfortunately mine happened right here at this time after a delay, but there is still a lot of golf left.  I'm just going to try to erase what just happened and get back to the mentality I had before this.
Q. Before the break were you feeling totally in control?
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah.  Honestly, I definitely was playing great.  Really consistent.  Gave myself a lot of chances.  Missed some coming up, and then I made that long one and it was kind of like balanced it out a little bit.
Then unfortunately the delay after that happened.  You know, like I said, it happens, but before that I hit the ball really well.  Just going to try to mentally get back into that stage.
