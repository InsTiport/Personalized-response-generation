 Q.   Nice round of 69, a good number of birdies for you.   
PAULA CREAMER:   Yeah, I did.   Unfortunately I had a couple bogeys to back that up, but I did, I played really well.   I hit the ball a lot better today than I did yesterday.   I just missed it in a couple wrong spots.   You know, the tee shot on 18 for some reason, I think I've hit it in that bunker every single day so hopefully tomorrow I can give myself a chance to go for it in two.  
   
 Q.   You hit some particularly good long shots as well, your hybrids, 15 you saw made a birdie on the hardest hole on the golf course.   
PAULA CREAMER:   Yeah, 15 and 17 is playing long, too, the par3 for us, it was straight into the wind and I put that hybrid in whenever it's really windy out.   I use it a lot at the British Open.   I love that club, it's one of my favourites.   It's a good distance and we've had a 190â€‘shot on the last couple of holes.  
I don't hit driver that often out on this golf course.   It's all about placement out here and giving yourself as many opportunities as you can and eliminating those big numbers and sometimes you're just going to have a longer shot in, and kind of suits my strengths.   I have to kind of think around this golf course, but one more day left and hopefully I can go out and play some good golf.   
   
 Q.   You had a good finish here last year.   
PAULA CREAMER:   I did.   I really enjoy this golf course.   I have a lot of great fans that come out and watch, and it's just tricky.   The wind completely turned out there the last hour and you have to be aware of it, and you know, it's a really packed leaderboard, but you can't control everybody else.   You just have to go out there and take care of your own business, and I'm really looking forward to the challenge tomorrow.
