  Q. How do you feel about your match today?  
 PAULA CREAMER: We didn't play very well out there. We tried to get it going there on the last couple holes. Juli started to hit some really good iron shots that we just couldn't capitalize on it. Really enjoyed it.   
 They played great. However, we just kind of gave them the match.  
  
  Q. At what point did you feel like the momentum started to shift out of your favor? Was there a specific point?   
 PAULA CREAMER: We were never up in the match. We lost the first two holes, and from there on we were always fighting back. And we won a lot of holes out there, but we just kept giving them back afterwards, and you can't do that in match play, unfortunately, but at the same time we'll get out tomorrow and hopefully our team can finish strong.  
  
  Q. What were the struggles that you guys faced?  
 PAULA CREAMER: There were just a bunch. Lots of things didn't happen.   
 You have your plan, but didn't quite do that, didn't quite go on that plan, but that's all right. It is one point. It's a big point, but at the same time we have our singles matches tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Lastly, how does this set you up for tomorrow? How does it make you better to play?  
 PAULA CREAMER: Hopefully I can go out. I feel I have a lot of confidence. I'm hitting the ball really well and I'm putting the ball great, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Good luck.
