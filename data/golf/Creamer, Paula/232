   PAULA CREAMER: You know, honestly, I didn't play the par 5s very well unfortunately but I made some really long putts and some short ones and just kind of gave myself as many opportunities as I could. I had to play aggressive.

 Q. People say you're the best player never to win a major, but you're only 22, so you must take that as a huge compliment?
 PAULA CREAMER: I'm not 22 yet, I have one more week and then I'm 22, you know, it's a thing that, you know, I don't really think about. 
 I take every tournament the same. Obviously you want to do well in the majors and you want to win, but as long as I give myself a chance to win a tournament, that's all I can ask you.

 Q. Why the nickname of Pink Panther?
 PAULA CREAMER: I love the colour. I've always liked the colour pink ever since I was a little girl, and I always wear something, whether it's a ribbon in my hair or a spike my shoes, and my parents started calling me Pink Panther one day, and it just kind of stuck.
