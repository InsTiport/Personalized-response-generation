 Q.  Very good match over two days.  How hard was it to go out this morning and stay focused? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  We want to come out early, playing in the rain and the wet.  We're a team, but, you know, we played good together yesterday and a couple errant shots here and there, but overall feel good about how we played. 

 Q.  The greens are very difficult, very slow.  Big problem for you guys? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  I don't know.  We made a couple birdies out there and got us to 1-up, and 17 we made bogey and careless mistake there.  Finished strong.  Partner made a good par, and we had a good chance at birdie and try to go out this afternoon and play as good as we can. 

 Q.  The thing you're up against Maria once again.  Was it already back in your mind when you saw her playing in morning? 
 PAULA CREAMER:  You have to take one match at a time.  Now that the match is over, I can focus on that and just go out and play my own game and put some pressure on her.
