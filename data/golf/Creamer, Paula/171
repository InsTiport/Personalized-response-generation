  Q. I wish we were talking about you being in contention, but instead we're talking about the thumb. How much pain were you in the last couple holes?  
 PAULA CREAMER: That shot on 17 was pretty bad. I just felt it go into my shoulder. But you know, I know it's going to happen out here. That's kind of part of this whole process, that there's going to be shots unfortunately I hit in a very bad spot, and the only thing that goes through your mind is oh, my goodness, this is going to hurt. Luckily I only had a hole and a half to go, and they were two par-5s.  
  
  Q. What do you do now?  
 PAULA CREAMER: I just ice it, I go see the doctor hopefully. It spasms a lot. The muscles are so tight as it is, and when it causes all the friction when you hit a bad shot, it just makes it so much worse, and hopefully I'll get some soft tissue work done, and we can wake up in the morning and go tee it up again.  
  
  Q. If you had had more holes to play than just the last two, would you have withdrawn?  
 PAULA CREAMER: It's tough to say because luckily I didn't. But I went through the same thing last week, and I had about eight or nine holes left, and I went through and finished the round.   
 But in this situation, you never know. It's a different grass, it's a different golf course. But I'm lucky I didn't have to make that choice.
