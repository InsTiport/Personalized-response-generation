Q.  Cristie Kerr, I'll start with you.  Fantastic match.  It looked like you were hitting it as good as you can expect, and down the stretch you came up big.

CRISTIE KERR:   Paula really won this match for us.  I had it a little bit in the end for us, but she was my rock the whole match, and she was so solid and she made the birdies when we had to to halve.  She kept us up in the match.  She's a hell of a player.
Q.  She proved that today.  Paula, it looks like you live for this moment.

PAULA CREAMER:   Like she said, we're a team.  I'm there for her and she's there foro me.  We both have each other's back.  I was in trouble, she got up there and put it to them.  We kept the pressure on all day, and we played our games, and, you know, they put up a good fight.
Q.  Any nerves on that last putt?

PAULA CREAMER:   Oh, yes, but I knew my partner was behind me.  Our team, we're doing great and having fun and playing good golf.
Q.  All square heading into the singles tomorrow.  Ladies, good luck.

CRISTIE KERR:   Thank you.

PAULA CREAMER:   Thank you very much.
