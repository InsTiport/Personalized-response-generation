Q.
How did the team setup work today?

BETH DANIEL:  It started out rough after the 1st hole, but after that, we settled down and we gave ourself plenty of birdie opportunities.  It's disappointing.  We played what I consider to be the best alternate team.

Right now, Koch is playing unbelievable at this time.  Paula had a lot of great putts, and we had a lot of approach shots.  I never putted today except for a lot of cleanup putts, 2  to 3 foot putts.  I parred on 6, Par 3, after Paula had a great shot.
Q.  Tell us about your first hole.

PAULA CREAMER:  The 1st hole shot was basically my worst shot in my bag.  It's between a 96 to 100 mark, which I have trouble with.  It was very emotional.
Q.  Is this different than the Curtis Cup?

PAULA CREAMER:  It's ten times different than the Curtis Cup.  The Curtis Cup was great, and that gave me an opportunity to feel what it's like to play on a team, but this is so much more emotional, and gallery wise and fan wise, it's just so different than the Curtis Cup.
