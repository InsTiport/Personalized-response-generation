Q. Paula, very good round of 68.  You must be very pleased.
PAULA CREAMER: I am.  It was definitely a solid day.  Hit a lot of the fairways, hit a lot of greens, and when I missed a green I got up and down.  So it was good.  It was nice to go out there and make some birdies and no bogeys.
Q. And very good to be in contention.  Been a difficult year.
PAULA CREAMER: It has.  It definitely has been a learning experience for sure.  I have had so many up and downs, but it was good out there and play good golf.  Had a good couple weeks off after Evian and kind of resituated some things and worked hard with my coach, Kevin.  See what happens this week.
Q. Having a great round like this is good for the confidence.
PAULA CREAMER: Oh, it is.  Like I said, I've had a new coach all year, and that's kind of a hard thing to do, especially when you want to come out and play so well.
But at the same time, I know that I needed a change.  He's really worked hard on my mental game, but my short game, he's worked a lot with my golf swing.  It's different when you take it to from the range to the course.
Q. How cool is the city, Shanghai?  What a great tournament.
PAULA CREAMER: It is.  I arrived on Saturday and went into the city on Sunday, into Shanghai.  It's been awesome.  It's very cool.  They take such good care of us and the people here are so friendly and nice.  They love their golf.  I definitely have enjoyed my time here so far.
