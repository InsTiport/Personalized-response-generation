  Q. How did it feel?  
 PAULA CREAMER: It was a good match. Cristie played awesome out there. That front nine, she really helped me out.   
 I made a couple of good holes, but overall, Cristie played awesome. And they played great, too. This golf course is so long. I think it's a huge advantage for length out here, and I just try to always be in and around the hole for par.  
  
  Q. Talk about that long putt. I forget the hole.   
 PAULA CREAMER: 16.  
  
  Q. On 16. Kind of a little momentum change out there.   
 PAULA CREAMER: That was huge. We kept bringing it back to all square, but then they'd win the next one, and it was a big, big putt for us to actually first time we were going up in the match. And from there on, on 17 Cristie made a great birdie and then a birdie on 18.   
 It was a 45-footer, a huge break. Cristie was about two feet behind me, so I got a good read.  
  
  Q. This afternoon, obviously going out with Juli, you're familiar with her game. Just talk about what you're looking forward to today.   
 PAULA CREAMER: No. I'm really excited to go out with Juli. We're a great team together, especially on alternate shot. It's going to be a good match playing with Catriona and Janice, but at the same time I think if we get up early in the match, it's going to be -- we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. Cool. Appreciate it.
