Q. Can you just sum up a nice day?
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, I hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of opportunities.  I birdied all the par 5s except one.  Yeah, just played pretty solid golf.  I left some out there for sure, but played solid.
Q. What's it like when you -- nine shots behind before you hit your first tee shot, and how does that affect how you approach things?
PAULA CREAMER: It was crazy.  I look over at the board, and I'm like, holy cow, 9 under.  Before I even teed off, it was 9 under.  I was like wow.  That's the thing.  You can't really think too much about it, and I feel like I've been out here long enough to know that.  But it is hard.  You don't want to be nine back before you've already teed off.
It just shows you that the golf course is out there.  You can make a lot of birdies.  40 under is not going to win the tournament and just to keep track of it.
Q. The other thing is how have you been doing with Gary, with progressing?  You look like you're really confident with the swing and everything?
PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, I feel great.  I'm just in -- I'm excited.  I love what I'm doing.  I really believe in his philosophy of teaching me.  I think he's brought the kid out of me, that's for sure.  It's a great match.  I really trust what he's teaching me, and I can go out and do it, which is kind of a big thing.  But I'm very pleased with everything, and hopefully it goes for a long time.
Q. Was the wind at the end here enough to get your attention?
PAULA CREAMER: No, nothing like yesterday afternoon, but it will pick up, like it always does.
Q. On number 5, that was almost like a Singapore putt there?
PAULA CREAMER: Oh, the eagle, yeah.  I had no idea.  He took the flag out so fast, I had no clue where the hole was.  He was tending it, and I had no idea where the hole was.  So I just went by everybody else's reactions.  It lipped out.
