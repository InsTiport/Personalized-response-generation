  PAULA CREAMER:   HSBC, their events, they know how to take players, and especially in another country, you never know what's going to happen.   The fact of the security and just the rooms, the hotels are great.   They put us up in a wonderful place, and everything just falls into place.   
My play so far, it's been up‑and‑down.   Working on a lot of things this year trying to fix my golf swing a bit, and getting back to hopefully in the winner's circle later in the year and just trying to get used to my new swing out on the course.
