 Q. Tell us about the ranch. 
 PEGGY NELSON: We had so much fun out at the ranch. We had 20, 25 people, some of the pros and their wives and kids came out, and they got to do tours of the house, which is always fun for me.
 It's about Byron's memorabilia and some of the things he made from wood, and just some wonderful things about his character and the kinds of qualities he displayed of perseverance and patience and just loving me. 
 So the kids got to fish and it was a lot of fun. It was good food and hot. The girls got to go meet my horse, Mr. Peppy, and it was fun doing that. Just enjoyed having everybody come out.
