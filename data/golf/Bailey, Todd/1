TODD BAILEY: After yesterday's start, I just knew I had to shoot something under par today.  And I got off to a great start.  I birdied the first three holes.  That really got me going.   
I was able to get focused, and even my bad shots ended up good today, which was just the opposite of yesterday.  So I had it -- made a really good putt on 10 to get to 5-under for the day.  And I just I grinded out a lot of pars, made one more bogey coming in.  I grinded out a lot of pars to finish.   
 Q.  What do you think the biggest difference was between today's round and yesterday's?  
TODD BAILEY: I think the greens were a little smoother.  Obviously it wasn't blowing as hard.  It was easier to pick clubs.  And basically my back was against the wall.  So something good happened.  Some magic was out there, still.  So all those things kind of led to it.  So I was pretty happy about it.   
 Q.  Going forward, what do you think is the biggest thing you need to work on or do to stay around the top of the leaderboard?  
TODD BAILEY: I putted so much better today, getting a better feel on the greens speed-wise.  Still can't read the breaks very well.  But I've got a great caddie this week, a local member who has been here 35 years.  He's helping me out a good bit.  So just kind of figuring out where the holes are and figure out where to hit it and attack the hole from there and 2-putts are always good out here.
