Q. What did you think today?
JULIEN SALE: Today was pretty good, yeah.  I played pretty well, I putted really well, because at the beginning of the round I had a couple and didn't make them, but I had a couple times where I was like 10 feet for par and I made those ones that kept the round going.
And then at the end of the front nine at 8 and 9 I holed two really long putts for birdie, so that was very nice.  And then I kept playing, I thought I was going to go bogey-free because I was putting pretty well, but then I struggled on the one par-3, I didn't hit a good shot and, yeah, I took the bogey because it was a tough hole.  But in the end I played really well today.  It was solid.
Q. You're well positioned for going forward, so how does that make you feel heading into tomorrow where No. 4 has been playing a little easier?
JULIEN SALE: So what I've been seeing the scores are a little bit lower on No. 4.  The course is not easier, but it plays -- like you can see the scores played a little bit easier on No. 4.
So I feel good for tomorrow, I feel like I have a good chance to make the top 64 and then we'll see after that, it's match play, so, yeah.
