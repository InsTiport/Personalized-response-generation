Q.   How exciting was it playing and watching the leaderboards and seeing what you're doing? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I actually was enjoying a lot to be there.   I've been playing good the last few weeks, so I'm very happy that I can make a very good round today.

Q.   Have you felt a performance like this coming? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yes, I've really been playing very good and I've been working hard, also.   So I think if you keep working on just staying patient, good things come.

Q.   Tell us about your decision process on 17. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I just was trying to hit a 3‑wood in front of the green just to have a chip.   Anyway, if I hit it short, I put the bunker in play.   I just wanted to go to the front of the green. 
Actually I hit a good 3‑wood, just a little fade.   I didn't see where it bounced but I think it goes to the water.

Q.   When you saw it in the water, did you think your chance was gone?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Not really.   I just stayed focused and I say I'm going to make four and maybe have a good chance for birdie again.   But I was focused on what I was doing.

Q.   And now are you excited to see if it's good enough for a playoff? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, hopefully playoff, I don't know.   I just have to wait now.   Nothing else I can do.
