Q. Tie second.  Just give us your thoughts.
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, pretty happy with all week.  I've been play good the back nine, but it was a good week.  I hit it better, but the putter, I think it got a little cold on the back nine.
Q. What positives do you take from this week?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: A lot of positives.  I was in contention all the week.  I think I was close to win a great tournament.  Matt played great golf the back nine and he deserved it big time.
Q. How impressed were you with him, young golfer, playing in front of a big crowd?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Every time I hit a good shot, he hit a good one later.  So very impressed with him.  Like I say, he deserves it.  He's a good champion.
Q. Nice to be taking some good form into the final few events?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, exactly.  I think this is going to help me a lot to get to Dubai probably with this.  I am very close already to Dubai.  Yeah, it's been a great month for me.  The last few weeks, I've been playing very good, so I'm very happy with that.
