  FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Very, very happy, a great round today.   I was a little nervous, but it was a great round.   I made six birdies, no bogeys, so pretty happy about that.  
   
 Q.   Every round this week, you've played under par.   It must be a course that you really enjoy playing.   
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, it was awesome to play here with all of this crowd, and you're walking on 18, and I don't know, I never played an Open, but this I think looked like an Open and it's great.   
   
 Q.   You're in really good form at the moment and you had some good rounds at Wales, as well.   You must be pleased with where your game is at at the moment?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, my game is getting better, putting good and striking better, so I'm very happy.   Yesterday, 4‑under in tough conditions, and today, I don't make a bogey, I think it's really good.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on actually playing links golf, because you won't have played that many times in your life?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   No, I don't play that many times in my life.   Yesterday I played one of the best golf rounds of my life with that weather, making 4‑under for me, it's pretty tough, because I'm not used to it.   But I'm getting used to it, so that's good.   
The last tournament, I mean, Sunday was very tough again, and I don't have a good round, but I keep calm and this week I came and played very calm, played really good.
