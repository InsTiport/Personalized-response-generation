  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Many congratulations, BMW International Open champion.   Tell us how you're feeling right now.   Must be amazing.
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I feel very happy.   This is a moment I've been waiting for a long time.   Such hard work, and I'm very happy, that's all I can say, very happy.
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Tell us about the playoff.   It was unbelievable to watch. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   The playoff, I think it was great, and in the first hole, I made a great putt and on the second again.   And then we keep playing good.   We keep hitting good shots I think.   When Henrik hit into the water on that hole, I hit a great 3‑wood.   It was a putt short‑‑ I hit a great 3‑wood and it was a little more easy from there. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   And then tell us about your round before the playoff.   You played so well in the final round.
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I've been playing good the last few weeks and been putting me in contention a lot of times, and today comes the day.   I played very solid on the weekend.   I didn't make one single bogey.   So the last two rounds, I played very good. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   And how special to win your first victory here at a BMW event? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I've been waiting a long time to have my first win on The European Tour.   I think it is my third year on the Tour, so I am very happy that the moment comes today. 

Q.   You're the first guy from Paraguay to win on The European Tour.   What does that mean? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   That is pretty huge I think.   I think Paraguay, everybody is going to be very happy with me.   Everybody was expecting a lot from me in Paraguay, so I think it's going to be a great day. 

Q.   When Henrik went in the water, what were your thoughts and did you change your game plan?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   If Henrik hit it to the green, I was going to hit driver like I do the first time.   But when I saw the ball go to the water, I just change it and just aim to that left bunker on the green and I hit a solid 3‑wood there. 

Q.   How many golf courses and golf players do you have in Paraguay? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   In Paraguay, we only have five golf courses in all the country. 

Q.   How many players? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I can't say how many players but not too much.   I really don't know the number but there are just a few. 

Q.   Is Carlos Franco a household name in Paraguay?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Carlos is huge in Paraguay.   He won a few times on the PGA TOUR.   Imagine I watch him growing up winning tournaments on the PGA TOUR, so now I am the first Paraguayan to win on The European Tour, so I'm very happy and I think it's pretty huge. 

Q.   What will you do tonight and what do you think of your prize, more than 300,000 Euros? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I'm not thinking about that really.   I am just going to try to enjoy the moment with my wife that she's sheer.   Actually it's pretty special for me she is here in my first win.   I am going to enjoy the moment.   I don't know what I am going to do.   Have some dinner, drink something maybe, I don't know. 

Q.   What did Henrik say to you after he hit the ball in the water, when he went over to shake your hand, what did he say to you? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I just remember he said, "You played solid, congratulations, you deserve it."       And then everybody comes and can't hear anything.

Q.   Your caddie used to caddie for Angel Cabrera, right? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   He used to caddie for Ricardo, but I don't know if he caddied to Angel Cabrera, but he caddied to Eduardo Romero on the Senior Tour. 

Q.   Was Carlos Franco your idol? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yes. 

Q.   Do you have the same practise like he does?   He never goes to the range. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Actually, no.   I practise a lot. 

Q.   You played with Maximilian RÃ¶hrig in the first two rounds, the German amateur, and I just talked to him and he said that he can't believe it; you had such a slow start; you had a par round.   What happened the next three days? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I hit the ball good the first day but I don't hole the putters.   The second day I start holing putters and everything, when you start holing putters, everything get a little better. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Many congratulations once again.
