Q. Your thoughts on your round today?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, very pleased with my round.  I played really good, and I think I took advantage of the morning when there was less wind.
Q. How different were conditions today to yesterday?  Was it much easier?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, exactly.  Yesterday we were playing like two clubs wind, and today it was just a little breeze.  Yes, it was totally a different golf course, I think.
Q. How do you find the greens?  They look very grainy.
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, they are a little grainy, but I think in the mornings -- today in the morning they were great, so you can putt it really good, and obviously in the afternoon with all the guys playing, they get a little worn, but it's the same for everybody.
Q. What do you think of this golf course?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, yes, it's a really nice golf course.  You need to hit it straight, and probably on the weekend they are going to put tougher pins and it's going to be a tough test.
Q. And how are you going to approach the weekend now the next two rounds?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Oh, just keeping my process, keep doing what I've been doing these last three weeks.  I'm playing really good.  I'm confident with my golf swing, so just try and do my thing, stay calm and stay in my process.
