Q. 6-under par, how pleased to kick off your 2021 European Tour season with a round of 66.
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, it feels really good.  I didn't practice too much at home.  I was with COVID, I have it already, but I just have enough time to come here and at the end I just finished practising like six days before coming, and I was feeling good.  The practice rounds were good, also, and today I think I do what I practice.
Q. With everything going on, how nice to be back out with the season starting up again playing golf?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   It's really tough.  I am coming from Paraguay.  It's very tough to get the flights and then to go back home.  So to be here playing, it feels great, really.
Q. With the delays, it looks like it's going to be a long day tomorrow.  How to best prepare yourself for that?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, the good thing is I already know it's going to be a long day, so I don't have to wait and hopefully tomorrow there is no more fog.  So I'm just going to go have lunch now, a little practice and then go and rest.
Q. When you signed for your score without dropping a shot, that must give you a lot of confidence for the rest of the week?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Exactly.  It's a really good start, bogey-free on the final round of the year, so yeah, it feels great and hopefully I continue this way.
