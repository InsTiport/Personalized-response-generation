 Q.  What do you make of that start?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: I think it was a pretty good round.  Two very good saves on the good nine and that kind of keep my round in a good way.  Then on the second nine, I played great.  I could have shoot a little lower.  I missed some putts on the end but I'm very happy.   
 Q.  So do you get a sense of a really good, low score out there and possible for you?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, yeah.  It could be a little lower, but anyway, to start this tournament with a round of 4-under, no bogeys, is pretty good I think.   
 Q.  How was it playing as one of the first starters and so hardly any traffic along the course?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, it was good.  The greens were perfect, absolutely perfect.  So yeah, sometimes it's good to start with a course like this.   
 Q.  And good fun playing alongside Emiliano?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, we have a lot of fun.  We are very close friends.  Probably this is his last tournament here with us because next year he's going to the PGA TOUR.  So it was very nice to start this tournament with him.   
 Q.  What's your attitude in the season-ending event?  It's been a good year, but do you think, kick on, one more very good week?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, obviously.  I think everybody wants to play good here.  So yes, keep it going three more days and see what happens on Sunday.
