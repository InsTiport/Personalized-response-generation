Q.   Tell me about today's round, that's a lovely move in the right direction?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, it was a really good round.   Actually I've been playing very good the first two days, and then my putter was a little cold and today I made some putts. 

Q.   And are you conscious at the start of play that a good round could put you right up there?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yes, I was expecting to have a low one to have a chance to many.

Q.   Nice consistency at the moment, because you played well at Austria and getting the form together. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yes, I've been getting form.   I've been working a lot.   So I am very happy that I am in position most of the weeks.

Q.   Is it something that's just clicked into place; just one of those that the work is getting the rewards at last? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Well, last year I made some changes and now I'm getting some confidence.   Once you start playing good, you have more confidence and you start playing better. 

Q.   A nice extra thing this week is the possibility of getting to The Open Championship.   Is that something you're thinking of? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   I'm just trying to enjoy the week, it's a lovely place and just try to do my best.

Q.   When you play like this, it could be a nice bonus. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, a great bonus, but let's see what happens tomorrow.
