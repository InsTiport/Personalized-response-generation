Q.   Happy man with a round like that here? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, very happy.   Played really solid, and very good short game, and with the long day, I think I stayed patient and I played a really good round.

Q.   It has been a long day and presumably that changes the way the course plays, as well, with so much rain. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, the course is a lot‑‑ it's very soft now, and the practice round was very hard.   So it was a little different.   Greens very soft, a little different course. 

Q.   You tend to like coming here, don't you?   You've had some nice results. 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   Yeah, I like playing here.   I like the course.   I like the crowds.   It's a great tournament.   I like to be here and play here. 

Q.   Is there something about the nature of the course, the way it shapes, that you just like the way it suits your eye? 
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI:   No, I think I enjoy the place, the tournament.   It's a big tournament for us, and I enjoy playing here.
