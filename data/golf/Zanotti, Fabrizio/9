Q. Nice start with the opening five holes and from hole 6 on it got very interesting?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, exactly.  Like I said the other day, you have to be patient on this golf course.  Greens are a little tricky, so I had my chances on the first five holes but I keep patient and then the birdies come.
Q. The eagle on 7 got you into a tie for the lead that.  Must be particularly pleasing?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, I hit a really good 3-wood.  It was a little lucky with the bounce but then I made the putt.  It was a good putt I think.
Q. You must be particularly pleased with your play to the greens at the moment.  You haven't left yourself too many long putts today, which is always a bonus?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, exactly.  You don't want to leave long putts on these greens because they have a lot of movement.  But yeah, I'm happy with the way I'm playing.
Q. Third place and a fourth place recently.  Do you think this can be the one you finally get a victory?
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Hopefully.  Tomorrow I'm going to come and try to do the same I've been doing these three days, and it's going to be my day, great.
