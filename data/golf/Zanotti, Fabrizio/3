 Q.  Second 66 of the week to finish off and no dropped shots today.  How pleased are you with the way you finished this tournament?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, I'm happy with my last three rounds.  I think I played really solid.  My iron game was really good this week.  So I am happy; that gives me confidence for the next few weeks.   
 Q.  You said yesterday it was a slower start on Thursday.  What did you learn about Thursday that helped you out over the next three days?  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: I played okay on Thursday, but I just didn't hole some putts, and some bad mistakes.  Just keep doing my thing.  Just keep trying to hit it the way I hit it on Thursday and I keep very patient.   
 Q.  Tied eighth at the moment and that's your best finish in the Rolex Series this year.  That must be pleasing to get inside the Top-10.  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yeah, it's really good.  I was not playing good these Rolex Series events, so hopefully here, I have a Top-10.   
 Q.  You started at 25 in The Race to Dubai and this will elevate you inside the Top-20, so lots to look forward to now over the next two weeks the way you're playing.  
FABRIZIO ZANOTTI: Yes, exactly.  That's very good, if I go inside the Top-20, it's going to help me also for the next two weeks.  I'm just trying to finish the best I can.
