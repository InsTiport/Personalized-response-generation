 Q.   Talk about your day.   
JASON KOKRAK:   I tried to stick to my game plan and really didn't strike the ball the way I did yesterday.   I didn't hit it all that well yesterday.   I just kind of got a couple eagle putts to fall.   And we'll go out there tomorrow, the Nicklaus course doesn't really setup to my eye, so it's a little bit tougher course.  
   
 Q.   What was the focus to work on as you get ready to go over to Palmer tomorrow?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Just committing to the golf shots.   I'm not hitting it as far as I was at the end of last season.   So a little wind corrections here and there, not quite on point with the total distance of what we're trying to hit it, but overall it's not that bad.  
Hitting greens and giving yourself as many birdie opportunities is what you got to do out here.   So if you give your self 16 birdie opportunities, you're going to make a third of them and that gives you 4 or 5-under.   And if you can make a couple par saves out here, that's what's going to save your round.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you have to adjust to playing with amateur partners out here, you're playing with Ron white as your partner and on a day you're struggling, does the humor help you along a little bit?  
JASON KOKRAK:   We had some fun.   Ron's a nice guy.   He wasn't in his comedic stand up personality, but we had some fun.   He told us a couple jokes, so it was a good time out there.   A little tougher to focus today as opposed to yesterday.   But looking forward to tomorrow, really trying to just refocus and try to shoot a low number to put myself in a really good position for the final round.
