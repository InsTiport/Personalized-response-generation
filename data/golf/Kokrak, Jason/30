 Q.   You are in pretty good position heading into Sunday.   How did it feel out there, pretty good solid round?  
JASON KOKRAK:   It wasn't as solid as my card looked.   But I made due with what was out there.   I made some great up‑and‑downs, some really nice par saves.   
Looking forward to tomorrow.   Just have fun and try to hit some more fairways and greens than I did today.   
   
 Q.   You could essentially get your first win tomorrow if you play well.   What will be your focus and mindset tomorrow?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Fairways and greens.   I mean if it's windy like this, if you can give yourself birdie opportunities, you're going to be ahead of the game.   There's a few key holes out there, if you can make pars you'll be fine and take advantage of birdies coming back.  
   
 Q.   And finally, on a tough golf course like this, is it your driver you're really focusing on this week?   What is it?  
JASON KOKRAK:   It's just trying to get it in the fairway.   Into the wind holes you're trying to hit driver, and downwind you're hitting 3‑iron and 3‑wood.   It just depends on the hole.   Everything is situational, depends on the wind and it can definitely blow out here like it did the first day.
