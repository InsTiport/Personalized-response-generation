 Q.   Why are you a 167th on the Money List?   That was impressive round of golf.   
JASON KOKRAK:   I appreciate it.   Just got into a little bit of a funk this year.   Got out of things I was working on.   I didn't drive it well, I didn't hit irons well, but really putted consistent this year, and that's what kept me in position to do this this week.   
Hopefully this gets me a little bit closer to that 1 125 number.   We have two more events.   You never know.   Jonas came in third last week.   Maybe I'll go out there and win next week.  
   
 Q.   You played with a guy today that's won 35 times, three majors, and he was impressed.   That's got give you a little bit of confidence.   
JASON KOKRAK:   Absolutely.   I played with Vijay once earlier this year.   I think it was my first Sunday ever in a PGA TOUR event, and I really stood up and played some good golf.   I hit good quality golf shots.   
You know, got it done out there.   Got my first top 10, which put me in position for the rest of the year.  
It's just nice to play well this week.   It gives me confidence going into the rest of the year.
