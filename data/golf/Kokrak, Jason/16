 Q.  What's working well in your game?  
JASON KOKRAK: I worked with my coach and was struggling in a practice round on Wednesday.  My legs get a little bit too jumpy and move around a lot.  So we worked on that and I started hitting the ball pretty good and I'm just trusting it out there.  I've given my self a lot of close opportunities.  I rolled the putter very well yesterday and today didn't make quite as many, but still gave myself a lot of chances.   
 Q.  Talk about your shot on the second hole here?  
JASON KOKRAK: Yeah, we had a great number there.  Just hit kind of a half wedge there, I think it was 132, and I knew I had a little bit of a back stop, a touch into the breeze and a new wedge, spun it back and just about a ball out on the right-hand side and rolled it in.   
 Q.  Half wedge from 132, you realize that's ridiculous, right?  The par-5s, you're obviously one of the longer hitters out here.  How important is it to hit these high, flighted irons like you did here?  
JASON KOKRAK: I had a good number, I knew I couldn't probably hit it over the green -- I knew I couldn't fly it over the green -- but I've hit the ball higher and higher since I switched to Titleist and it's just helped out a lot into the par-5s, because I can land a 4-iron pretty soft into some of these firmer greens.   
 Q.  You didn't play until last week, how did you spend that time?  
JASON KOKRAK: Spent time with my wife and kid, my kid just turned one years old, so a lot of fun watching him grow up.  Spent a little bit of time packing, my wife are in the process of moving.  So spent most of the time packing and looking at homes.
