 Q.   Fought hard all week.   2 under today and 8 under par.   I think this is your best finish.   Another top ten, your third this year on tour.   Your thoughts on today.   
JASON KOKRAK:   I was really pleased with today.   I hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of good quality golf shots, right where I was looking.   The putter didn't cooperate today.   Left a couple short.   
I got a little scared on the first couple of holes.   I had a couple of downhillers that were pretty quick.   Other than that, I really can't complain.   If I would have gotten a few more and maybe contested Bill a bit more, never know what could happen.   
I'm happy with today.   I hit a lot of fairways and stuck with my game plan.   I was pleased with the way I played.  
   
 Q.   How much did you look at the leaderboard?   It was really jumbled up there for a while until Bill pulled away during the back nine.   
JASON KOKRAK:   I'm a leaderboard watcher.   I'm the type of guy, I like to know what I have to do.   I like the pressure.   So I watch it.   I like to know what I need to do.   
I don't want to come down to the last hole and play it safe when I need to make birdie.   That's one of the holes where I hit a great drive down there and hit the sand wedge in and just pushed it a little bit.   Tough shot into that green off that downslope, but I'm still happy.  
   
 Q.   Good stuff this week.   Good luck the rest of the year.   
JASON KOKRAK:   Thank you very much.
