Q. What a good week, especially with the irons.  You hit a lot of wedges, but number one in the field this week, strokes gained, approach shots to the hole.  You gave yourself a lot of chances.
JASON KOKRAK: Yeah, I did.  I think that was the game plan coming in, and I think I tried to rely on my ball striking too much in weeks past, and it just hasn't worked out.  So I tried to give myself a lot of opportunities and take advantage of where I hit it close.  It paid off.  I just couldn't make a couple down the stretch to scare Kevin there.
Q. You've come close here before.  One of these years you're going to win this thing.
JASON KOKRAK: One of these years I'm going to get one.
Q. You've really played this course well.  Why so?
JASON KOKRAK: I think I get to hit a lot of irons off the tees.  Make a couple of those shots easier.  I can reach all the par-5s.  You know, well, besides 15, that's a tough one to get to.  But I think the par-3s suit me well too because I hit my long irons pretty far and pretty high, so that helps out.
Q. Four top tens this season.  You're climbing the FedExCup points like crazy.  You're really working in a good spot as we get closer to the playoffs.
JASON KOKRAK: You've got to always peak at the right time.  I've been on the schneid a little bit, going in the wrong direction.  But I started off the season pretty strong, and trying to get better and better, and putting all the pieces together right now.
Q. A moment ago the officials from the Royal & Ancient Golf Club came up and said you're close to getting into Carnoustie.  You still have to wait a little bit though.
JASON KOKRAK: I'm going to have to wait.  It's not official yet, but hopefully I do get in.  It would be my first British.
Q. That would be pretty sweet.
JASON KOKRAK: Yeah, it would be.  Hopefully it works out, if so, I'd love to go over there and compete.  If not, there's always next year.
Q. You have to feel pretty good about the finish.  Lot of good qualities to your game this week.  How do you feel about the way things went for you?
JASON KOKRAK: You know what, after missing a couple cuts in a row and not really playing that well, I felt like my game was going in the right direction, just really starting to get on my nerves a little bit.  Just a few minor changes and just kind of freed it up a little bit this week.
I feel good.  Hopefully I get into the British.  If not, it's not the end of the world.  But I'm happy with the week, I'm happy with the way I wedged it.  I'm happy with my irons.  Putter could have been a little bit better, but gave myself a lot of chances.
Q. What would qualifying for The Open mean to you?  What does that championship mean to you playing in it?
JASON KOKRAK: Well, I mean, it's one of the four majors on this TOUR.  It's a bigger event over on the European Tour, I think.  But it would be my first one.  Gives me goose bumps talking about it.  But I'd love to go over there and compete, and I think I would play pretty well in that atmosphere.  We'll just have to see.  Hopefully the numbers work out and I do get in.
