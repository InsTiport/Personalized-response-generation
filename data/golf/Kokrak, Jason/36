 Q.   That's awfully tough out there today compared to yesterday.   Seemed like yesterday's scoring was easier.   Today's a lot tougher?  
JASON KOKRAK:   The wind was swirling out there.   It was tough to differentiate whether it was coming into you, left‑to‑right, right‑to‑left.   It was swirling a lot.   The pin placements were a lot tougher today, too.  
   
 Q.   Still made a lot of birdies.   1‑under par, feel good about your position?  
JASON KOKRAK:   I do.   If I can figure out the driver it's going to be pretty good this week.   I didn't really hit it good today.   Hit one bad tee ball, had to take an unplayable.   
Other than that I'm trying to keep it in play, just playing my own game.   I'm making a few putts this week.  
   
 Q.   You put yourself in position quite a few times this year.   You're having a nice, solid, consistent year.   Coming into the year was that part of the process, look, I want to be in contention as much as possible?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Yeah, absolutely.   I put myself in that position three, four, five times last year.   I've been inside the top‑20 a bunch of times this year.   One of these times I'm just going to connect the dots and get everything to together.   
   
 Q.   Be nice to do it at Arnie's place?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Absolutely.
