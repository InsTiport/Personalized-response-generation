Q. Jason, I thought you certainly battled it all day long.  Obviously the golf course played difficult in this final round.
JASON KOKRAK: Yeah, it did.  Greens were definitely a little bit firmer, maybe a touch faster. One bad break on the front kind of in the same zone I got a bad break yesterday, plugged in the bunker, almost didn't have a prayer in getting it out of the bunker.  Unfortunate.  I put myself in better positions today than I did yesterday.
I'm happy but, you know, still in search of that elusive first win but my game is trending in the right direction.  I putted well this week.  Didn't particularly drive it well on the weekend which you have to drive it well to really do something special on the weekend.
Q. Eight greens, eight fairways in this final round but you mentioned putting.  I think you were about 200th in strokes gained putting coming in this week.  You were 6th this week on the greens.
That's really something to take out of it.
JASON KOKRAK: I've been working with Dave Stockton, Jr. and his dad.  Made a putter grip change which made me feel a little more comfortable on the greens.  Speed wasn't awesome but better and the short putts were really good.
Q. You are projected to move up to 86th in FedExCup points.  That's more good news.  Keep moving up the ladder.
JASON KOKRAK: That's the goal.
