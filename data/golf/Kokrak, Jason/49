Q. You're right there heading into tomorrow. 
JASON KOKRAK:   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   I think the first time this year I put myself in really good position, so I'm looking forward to it. 
Just go out there and do the same things I did all day today.

Q.   What have you learned this year?   You've played a lot of golf, and obviously it takes an effect after a while, doesn't it? 
JASON KOKRAK:   Not be stereotypical, but just stay patient out there is the biggest key.   You got to put yourself in the right places.   You get a little bit out of position, you got to aim towards the middle of the green and take your medicine. 
But there were a lot chances for birdie today, so I took a few opportunities at the end of the round.   Try to get off to a little bit hotter start tomorrow.

Q.   Tomorrow is going to be a shootout, isn't it? 
JASON KOKRAK:   I think so. 

Q.   Are you excited about that?
JASON KOKRAK:   I can't wait.   I'm looking forward to it.   The course is giving up a lot of birdies right now.   The greens are a little softer than maybe Tuesday in the practice round.   I think actually they've been pretty consistent throughout the week, but hopefully they'll firm up tomorrow and make it a little bit tougher.

Q.   When you rolled in the eagle at 17 we called you the X Man.   You went to Xavier University.   You like that nickname?
JASON KOKRAK:   That's good enough for me.

Q.   All right.   Maybe the X man will win tomorrow. 
JASON KOKRAK:   Thanks, man.
