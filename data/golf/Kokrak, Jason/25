 Q.  Jason, really good round today.  You're 6-under heading to the weekend.  Thoughts on how you played the 2nd Round.  
JASON KOKRAK: You know, I hit it a little bit better today.  One miscue on my 17th hole there, No. 8 but got off the a great start, birdied the first three holes, really hit it much better today than yesterday but I'm looking forward to the weekend.  You know, this place brings back good memories and it will be fun weekend.   
 Q.  You finished 4th here back in 2014.  So you've got some good memories.  What is it about this golf course that suits your game?  
JASON KOKRAK: I played with Matt Every seems like every year.  No.  You know, I think there's places to miss it.  This year the greens are a little bit firmer so I think you got to hit fairways but it's just all about making putts on the weekend.   
 Q.  How scary is that bunker shot at 8 from behind the green?  
JASON KOKRAK: Extremely scary.  I couldn't hit it any better than I did.  I left the putt just short but, you know, one miscue.  The wind just turned directly around.  It was straight in my face and went straight downwind.  No big deal.  I flew the shot, hit a great shot in there.  The wind got me but it's changing around here and it will be a tough weekend.  Hopefully we can catch Jason.   
 Q.  Well done today.  Good luck on the weekend.  
JASON KOKRAK: I appreciate it.
