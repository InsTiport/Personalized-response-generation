Q. Jason, so consistent the first two rounds.  Second in strokes gained approach.  You haven't made a bogey.  You hit almost every green.  How have you been able to pull it all together here?
JASON KOKRAK: As I said earlier, it's just a culmination of everything I've been working on.  Just being more comfortable over the golf ball and trusting what I'm doing.  Trying to get the golf club a little more outside and with a little less curve.  So it seems to be working, and just making a few birdies, and just not making any mistakes.
Q. Why has this year been so much different than maybe in years past when you've played this event?
JASON KOKRAK: I'm not sure.  I've got family, my wife and kid are here this week, so I'm comfortable.  You know, I think that players play well in certain places every once in a while.  I don't think it's necessarily the same place every year.  But I think once you get comfortable, and if you start to play well, you're going to play well no matter where you're at.
Q. Give us the outlook for the weekend now as we head to Saturday and Sunday?
JASON KOKRAK: If I can continue to make no bogeys, that would be ideal.  But just continue to hit quality iron shots, give myself a lot of looks and take advantage when I do get close.
