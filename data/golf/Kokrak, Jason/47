  JASON KOKRAK:   I was able to relax and have a good time and, you know, take advantage of par-5s and make a couple putts here and there.  
   
 Q.   What was the secret, long drive?  
JASON KOKRAK:   I think, you know, a combination of I wasn't trying to hit it too hard off the tee, put in it position and give myself a really good opportunity, but couple of them were downwind, so I was able to hit the green in two with a long-iron, but probably a 4-iron and I think I had a 5-inch for the other one.   Just trying to hit wedges close and take advantage of these opportunities that I give myself.  
   
 Q.   Got to feel good with a 6-under.  
JASON KOKRAK:   Absolutely.   It's always nice to start off with a 66, 6-under par.   There's a lot of guys chasing me.   54 holes left.   There's a lot of golf left.  
   
 Q.   Harder the second 9 with the wind picking up?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Little bit.   Just hard to gauge how much the wind and where -- which direction -- it swirls a little bit here.   As long as you can gauge the wind and get the direction correct, you're going to be able to hit a good golf shot.  
   
 Q.   How do you think 6 will hold up?   I've seen a couple guys on the course, Matt Jones got to 6, he fell back to 4.   How do you think that will work?  
JASON KOKRAK:   There's holes out there that you can take advantage of, but if you put yourself -- the greens are firm, get it into a bunker, short side you're going to have a tough time getting it up and down.   Leave it on right side of the hole and give yourself a lot of opportunities for birdies, you'll be able to shoot 5, 6-under par.   Short side yourself, it won't be easy.   It's going to be a lot tougher out there.   It's always nice to get off to a solid start.  
   
 Q.   Jason, kind of been a not great year for you, been kind of inconsistent.   You had a great finish at Palm Springs, but what's kind of been going on, little swing stuff or what's up?  
JASON KOKRAK:   You know, I was getting the club shut a little bit on the way back.   I noticed that I think a few weeks ago in Tampa.   But, you know, I think I was just putting a lot of pressure on myself, going out there and thinking about the cut line, thinking about different things, and today I had a nice pairing.   I know these guys pretty well.   I've played a lot of golf with Brian and David.   I was comfortable out on the golf course.   The golf course sets up well for me.   It's a long enough golf course, but, you know, the greens are firm enough where I can take advantage because I'm hitting a lot shorter irons into the holes.   These guys were having a hard time holding the greens a lot of time and I'm hitting shorter clubs.   It's easy for me to spin it and hold it in position where I wanted it to.  
   
 Q.   So there wasn't anything that you technically really had to overhaul or anything like that?  
JASON KOKRAK:   No, no overhauling or anything like that.   Just, you know, the same thing I've been working on, just being comfortable with it and just going out there and being able to execute, I think, is the biggest key for me is to execute the shots the way I'm looking at them.   If I don't execute, I get a little frustrated with myself so that adds to it.   You're not playing well, it adds to the hard times.   
You know, I think just coming out this week, just trying to swing smooth, concentrate on tempo and, you know, put myself in the right position, not short side myself.   I did one time today, you know, with the bunker didn't have a lot of sand in it.   About a 35-footer.   14, I believe the par-3, I made a good solid putt there, downhill slider, 8 feet of break from 30 feet.   It was a nice putt to make especially, David chipped it in right before me.   The hole looked big.  
   
 Q.   This is a comfort factor for you since you played here last year.  
JASON KOKRAK:   It's a comfort factor for me all this year.   I played all these golf courses before I come out.   I don't have to go out there and grind for five, six hours out there on a practice round.   I can concentrate on what I need to do for the week instead of, you know, learning the golf course.   I can concentrate on my own game.  
   
 Q.   Kind a little freaking out last year a little bit?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Not really.   I like actually -- sometimes I play better without even playing a practice round.   Look at the golf course, step up, hit the shot you're trying to hit, you know.   You know something is there, you're kind of worrying about it.   I went out there, had a lot of fun, joked around a little bit.   Aaron and I had a lot of fun out there.
