 Q.   How tough was it out here today?  
JASON KOKRAK:   It was tough.   It was a little bit more runny than the rest of the days.   Still tricky winds up there.   I didn't have my best stuff today.   I got my ball turning over a little too much.   Didn't make the putts that I made the rest of the week.   
Matt played great.   He holed a lot of putts.   He's a great guy, great player, and I'm happy for him.  
   
 Q.   You've got to be proud of the way you battled back?  
JASON KOKRAK:   Absolutely.   I hit a great shot in there on No. 3 to get it back into form out of a hairy lie.   I hit the ball okay there for a while, just didn't hit the driver this week as well as I needed to to win.   
I'm happy with the week.   It sets up the rest of the year that I can just go for it.
