 Q.  Off to a nice start, a little bit of rain overnight, that changed the way the course played a little bit?  
JASON KOKRAK: Completely different.  Completely different.  It's soft.  It's playing a little bit longer.  Dried up this afternoon a little bit, but the greens are incredibly soft.  I mean, I spun back a 9-iron on 17 65 feet.  Kind of one of those days where you've just got to stay patient, on a couple putts and I did that, just made a stupid error on No. 9 but that was the only blemish.   
Now I can have lunch, practice a little bit and I have the rest of the day to do whatever I want, so it's nice.   
 Q.  Afternoon tee time tomorrow, be a little different.  
JASON KOKRAK: Yeah, hopefully the greens firm up a little bit.  But you just have to adapt to how the course changes.  But more rain than I expected, a lot softer conditions than I expected going out there this morning.
