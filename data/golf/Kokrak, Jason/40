  JASON KOKRAK:   Same thing as yesterday.   I got off to a little bit of a rough start.   This golf course, you're going to make a couple of bogeys heading into the rough here.   If you stay patient, hit good shots, you're going to have some good opportunities to birdie. 
Coming late in that back nine‑‑ or the front nine there and then early in the back nine, you can make a couple here and there.   I made a great birdie on 10 to get it to, I think, 2 under par. 
Just trying to stay solid all day.   Trying to hit the right shots, be aggressive where I could, and stay away from pins where I needed to.

Q.   Birdies at 8, 9, and 10.   You mentioned the one at 10.   At 8, you're in your putting stroke, and the phone goes off. 
JASON KOKRAK:   The phone goes off right on my backstroke, and the guy actually answers the phone and starts to talk and stuff.   Thankfully, I made the putt.   So no big deal.

Q.   How tough was 11? 
JASON KOKRAK:   11 is a really, really tough hole.   Tee shot's tough.   It's just a daunting tee shot downhill, but I think the second shot is one of the toughest in golf. 
I'm one of the longer players out here, and I hit a full 8 iron.   I forget how far I had.   It's a little bit up the hill.   I just tugged it a little bit.   I had the ball below my feet thinking it's going to cut a little bit.   Just a little bit of a double cross and put it in the bunker. 
Hit a great bunker shot from the downslope to give myself a 10, 12 footer for par.   Didn't hit a great putt there.   But 11 is one of the toughest holes on the PGA Tour.

Q.   Finally, thoughts on the final round, going off in threesomes early, and you're just one back. 
JASON KOKRAK:   I think I'm in a good spot.   I don't have to sleep on the lead.   Most of the tournaments that I've won, I've come back from one.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   It's going to be a fun day.   Hopefully, I can just play another solid round of golf tomorrow.

Q.   Well done.   Good luck tomorrow. 
JASON KOKRAK:   Thank you very much.

Q.   Jason, 6 under par heading into the final round.   Just get your thoughts on your day. 
JASON KOKRAK:   I played solid all day.   I got off to a little bit of a rough start, but I righted the ship.   I made a good putt on 8, a good birdie on 9.   Hit a really good wedge shot, playing those little kind of half wedge, take the spin off, and I birdied 10.   So that's a tough birdie there. 
I just try to stay solid.   Fairways are key out here.   Rough's long, and I actually played pretty well out of the rough all week.   I hit it down there a long way. 
But hopefully tomorrow we'll have some fun, hit a lot of fairways, and hopefully get a few putts to drop tomorrow.

Q.   Did you have a camera go off? 
JASON KOKRAK:   I had a phone go off on the 8th hole right in my backstroke, basically right in my follow through.   I ended up making the putt anyway.   The guy actually answered the phone and went behind the tree and answered it and started talking anyway. 
I thought it was pretty funny, but the crowd was pretty rowdy out there today.   Hopefully, they'll quiet down a little bit tomorrow.

Q.   Have you had‑‑ I mean, we've had tons of incidents.   Have you had that kind of thing happen before where the guy actually answers the phone? 
JASON KOKRAK:   I don't think I've ever seen anybody actually answer the phone.   I've heard like the phone goes off, and they just click it or whatever, and it shuts off.   But I don't think I've ever seen anybody actually answer the phone.

Q.   How does the schedule change affect your routine tomorrow? 
JASON KOKRAK:   I don't think it affects anything.   I'm going to get up couple hours before my tee time, try to get here about an hour and a half before, have breakfast.   Go out there about 50 to 55 minutes before my tee time and do the same thing I've been doing all week. 
I've been hitting the ball pretty solid.   A couple of mistakes here and there, but I've made quite a few birdies this week and hit some good shots even out of the rough.   So I like my chances tomorrow. 
I'm just out here to have fun.   If I put myself in this position a couple times a year, I'm just going to learn from the experience and hopefully get one of those wins sometime.
