 Q.  We're with Jason Kokrak, who just signed his card for a very nice 66.  That gives you a shot at the BMW Championship.  First, talk about your play.  You knew you needed a good number today.  JASON KOKRAK: I've been hitting the ball well all week.  The practice rounds were great.  I played nine holes on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then, you know, struggling with the driver a little bit.  But got it in play.  And I'm really happy with the way I played.  I played a great front nine but really just couldn't get anything going to kick start my round on the back. But one bad mis-hit on the last hole.  I knew I needed to make birdie to really solidify my spot in the BMW.  But I played well, and I put myself in good position to move on.  We'll see how the rest of the day goes.   Q.  Can you walk us through the second shot on 18?  JASON KOKRAK: The ball is a little bit below any feet, five or six inches.  There's a couple of guys yelling and screaming on the left side of 18 there.  Just caught it a little bit skinny.  I had 222 TO the front edge.  I hit 5-iron downwind.  Should have been a perfect number and just bladed it too much, and I was maybe two yards short of getting it over the hazard.  Made a good up and down to save par to still put myself in that 70 number.  But I needed that birdie.   Q.  Morgan Hoffmann just birdied 17.  That knocks you down to 71st.  This is still a fluid situation.  JASON KOKRAK: It is.   Q.  What do you do now over the next hour or so as this tournament develops?  JASON KOKRAK: Well, it was very humid out there today so go inside, cool down and just see what happens.  There's nothing I can do.  I played a great front nine and struggled a little bit on the back.  But there's nothing I can do.  It's a fluid situation, as you said, and you never know what will happen. I don't want to wish bad upon anybody, but I definitely want to play the BMW.
