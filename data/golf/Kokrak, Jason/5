  Q. We welcome Jason Kokrak, 2-under 68.  Great round today.  Talk us through how you feel.
 JASON KOKRAK:   Thank you.  You know, got off to a little bit of a rocky start, missing it left of 10, made a nice up-and-down, kind of horseshoed the chip shot, was really nice.  Just slipped a little bit on the second shot on 11, but after that kind of settled in, made some nice putts.  A few really key par saves to keep my round going and took advantage when I hit good shots.
 Q. Looks like a pretty clean front nine, birdies on 2 and 9.  Can you talk us through those two holes?
 JASON KOKRAK:   Yeah, 2 was -- I hit a great drive.  I had a really good number, 142 to the hole, which is kind of a soft wedge for me.  The wind was off the left, hit a nice little draw to hold the wind and it landed just behind the flag, spun back to about eight feet or so, straight up-the-hill putt.  And then on 9 hit a great drive right down the middle, had 223, kind of was worried about 5-iron going a little bit long but kind of took some off it, landed a little further than I thought and just over the back edge, hit the putt to a foot or so and it was kind of a really nice easy birdie finish.
 Q. What was the game plan coming into the week?
 JASON KOKRAK:   Fairways and greens, like any U.S. Open.  Fairways and greens.  I hit the driver well but not great.  I think if I can clean it up a little bit, the irons -- I'm hitting the mid-irons really well and just want to give myself a lot of opportunities and not shoot myself in the foot missing greens short or missing in spots where I don't need to.  Middle of the green on all the par-3s.  Made a nice par save on 3 from the right bunker, but other than that, very pleased with my round.
 Q. What's the game plan for the rest of today?
 JASON KOKRAK:   Lunch, a little bit of practice and then a nap.
