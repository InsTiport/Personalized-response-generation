 Q.   I think we should start at the end, because that eagle was vitally important, wasn't it?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It was nice, nice finish.   Birdie 17 and eagle on 18.   It was a very good day.   I played some very good golf from the tee, and that's the key on this golf course.   I think I don't miss a fairway with the driver, and that helped me to make some birdies.   
   
 Q.   I take it that's wonderful to get that kind of accuracy so early in the year, as well?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's nice to see that.   The nice thing is I see what I work on the swing is the good way to hit good drive, and as you say, more accuracy.   That's what I want and I'm really happy with that.  
   
 Q.   How much do you look at a leaderboard on a third day?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   I look at every board.   It's too big; you can't miss the leaderboard.   I'm just thinking on my game, and I was really excited to play a third round like that with a lot of round in very good weather, perfect condition.   It's perfect.   
   
 Q.   You should always be concentrating on your own game, but when you see a leader who is racing away, does that tempt you to change things and try to be more aggressive?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   No, I think he's alone at 20â€‘under.   I think he played really well, and just focus on your game and you'll see what happens.   I'm never thinking I'm going to finish birdie, eagle.   I'm just thinking to hit some perfect shot, that was the key, and I really enjoy to finish 2, 3 like that.  
   
 Q.   Obvious question is:   What are your thoughts into the final day of this event?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Just have fun like today and enjoy and see what happens.   Try to play like I did today, and just enjoy this perfect weather and perfect golf course.
