  ALEXANDER LEVY:   It's very nice to start the season like that.   I played very, very good golf, and I'm really happy because I work the last few weeks and I feel quickly the feeling on the golf course and I'm really happy.   
   
 Q.   Sometimes the first couple rounds of the year, you don't know what to expect; is that a bonus?   Is it a very good score in the circumstance?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's a very difficult golf course, and to play this tournament for the first of the year, it's very difficult.   I'm just thinking to do my job and I finish 6â€‘under, yeah, it's true, it's a bonus.   
   
 Q.   When you started the season, are you a player that sets targets, things you aim to achieve?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, just thinking to take pleasure like I take today.   Just enjoy on the golf course and see the shot and play the shot, and you see what's happening.   It's what I do today and it was working today.   
   
 Q.   Some people, attitude will change.   You seem very relaxed, having had the two wins last year, you might think, I expect a lot more of myself this time.   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I understand what you say, but when I come on the golf course, I'm really happy.   I don't know, I'm just thinking to enjoy and hit the proper shot and yeah, it's a different mind, but I'm just thinking about that on the golf course.   I feel it's nice and I'm going to try to do my best every week and see what happens.
