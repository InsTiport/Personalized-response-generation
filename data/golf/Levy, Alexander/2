Q. Second round 68, perhaps good fortune on 18 but overall a great round from you today?
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, it was a really good score, 4-under on this golf course, but my game is not at its best but I managed to shoot a really good score.  The putting helped me the first two days, so that's a really nice thing.
Q. So 6-under par in total, you must take some positives if you don't feel you're playing as well as you can to still be in contention at the top of the leaderboard?
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, exactly.  I just manage myself to be in good position.  Don't take any risk, that's what I did these first two days, so that's good.  Now it's the weekend and I'm in good position, so I will try to build the confidence a little bit better for the weekend and yeah, I will try my best.
Q. If anybody is to catch the leader at the moment, it looks like they are going to have to be quite aggressive over the weekend.  Is that something that would suit you on this golf course?
ALEXANDER LEVY: Like what I say, it will depends of the way I play golf.  I think if I have my A Game, I can be aggressive, but you need to really be careful on this golf course, so it will depends the way I hit the ball and I think Rory played his best game to shoot 12-under in two days.  I think you need to be in a really good way on this golf course.
Q. How enjoyable is it playing with the big crowds and the great atmosphere here?
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, it was really nice to play with two friends, Thomas and Francesco.  It was a really good day, good weather, for England.  But no, it was really good.  It's a good crowd.  It's a lovely place.  I really like this.
