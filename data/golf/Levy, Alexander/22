  ALEXANDER LEVY:   I feel I don't play that bad.   I make a few mistakes, but I don't miss a lot of shots.   Just some wrong shot on the wrong spot and very bad putting with the wind, it's not the first time and I think I need to work on that.   It was the same in Dunhill the last round.   I need just to work on that, the putting with the strong wind, and it's only that.   
   
 Q.   Totally different course today, wasn't it?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it was a totally different course, but I tried to do my best.   I hit the good shot at some holes and I do to try my best.   But if I want to win the tournament, shoot 6â€‘over the last round, it's not like that you win a tournament.   
   
 Q.   I appreciate you're disappointed but you'll also be delighted that Marcel Siem has done what he's done?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, he do a perfect day, right playing.   No, he deserved to win today because he played fantastic in the wind.   It's nice for him, and I'm not very disappointed because I played three days amazing golf and I think I need to keep that in my mind.   
Today was a special day with the wind, and it was not very easy for me.   I've got to work on that and to be more strong during the difficult weather like that.
