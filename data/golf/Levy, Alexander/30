  ALEXANDER LEVY:   Very happy to finish third.   It was a fantastic day, but I played good, I made a few mistakes at the end but it was a very nice day and I'm happy to finish third with great players this week. 

Q.   And how special to be on the green for the presentation alongside Ernie Els and Thomas BjÃ¶rn?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It's true, it's fantastic, it's two good players and two great champions.   I practiced for that and I'm very happy to be on this condition in the prize‑giving with two great champions.
I had a really good chance.   I played all the shots, happy, and just a few bad shots on the last and I make two bogeys.   It's a fantastic week and I can't say nothing bad about my game, I'm very happy. 

Q.   Is that just the nature of golf or were you trying to force things just a little bit? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I tried to work on that.   I work a lot because before I was not like that and I'm very happy today to see under a lot of pressure, I can feel good with that and it's nice to keep the smile on the golf course, and I hope it will be the same the next few years. 

Q.   You'll know with the money this week, that that translates into points, it's all good for World Ranking and for the season and keeping card and all sorts of things?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's true, it's nice for me first objective, and I'm very happy to finish third, and I know the cheque, it's a good prize, and I hope it will be the same the next few weeks.
