 Q.  Overall, how would you assess how that went for you?  
ALEX LEVY: I played good golf today.  Really solid with the iron play, and I think I missed two drives in the last three holes.  But I played really solid and I'm really happy with what I did today.   
 Q.  Fantastic up-and-down on 16.  Talk us through that.  
ALEX LEVY: I hit a bad drive on the left and I lay up, and I hole a really nice putt, I think like six, seven metres for par.  That was a good par and good save because it was a little bit up-and-down.  My 13, 14, 15 was a little bit up-and-down, so it was nice to make this par.   
 Q.  So close on 18 for a birdie.  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, but from that distance of putt but with this club, it's tough thinking to make, but it was really close.   
 Q.  Four back going into the final 36 holes.  What's it going to take to win this?  
ALEX LEVY: I don't know.  I just follow what I did today to enjoy, to hit some good shots and we will see what's happened.  I just want to think of my own game and I'm really pleased with the way I swing the ball.   
So I just follow that and we will see what happens.
