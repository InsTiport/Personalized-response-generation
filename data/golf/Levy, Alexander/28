Q.   Eight birdies but very nearly a ninth on the last, almost close to a perfect finish?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it was a very good round.   I am happy.   I played aggressive.   I don't miss some putts.   So I don't miss a lot of shots.   No, I play a very good round of golf and keep my strategy in place, my routine, and that's good. 

Q.   It's the first year you've played here, so it's a course that seems to suit your game based on today's effort?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   I played the European Team Championship there in 2011 just before I turned pro and I won there with the French team.   I know the golf course, it's a typical golf course I like and you need to hit a big drive and hole some putts.   I like the golf course like that.   No, I think it's a nice golf course for me.

Q.   It seems quite a long time since we spoke in China after your first win.   Sum up things since then. 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's true.   I think China gave me confidence, and I try to learn about that.   I make a few mistakes the last few weeks.   I take three weeks off to come back in a good way, and I think I do a good decision, because after the three weeks off, I do a good job last week, and with this week today, I think I need to continue like that.
