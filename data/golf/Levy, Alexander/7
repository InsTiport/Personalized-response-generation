Q. Alex, you've made quite a few appearances in Morocco.  Is this a week you enjoy on the schedule?
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, it's a really nice week, really nice place.  The course, they changed a bit of the course, especially the greens.  So it's a different golf course but it's a really nice place and I really enjoy to be here.
Q. What's the key to success around this golf course?
ALEX LEVY: I think the ball-striker will be -- will be the most important on this course, and also, you need to manage well to be in good position.  I think the long game is most important on this golf course.
Q. You're in good form this year with three Top-10s to your name.  Do you feel like your game is progressing really well?
ALEX LEVY: I feel especially I'm working well, and that's a good point.  So I'm really pleased with that.  So now I just need to be in confidence on the golf course and just enjoy and try my best on the course.
