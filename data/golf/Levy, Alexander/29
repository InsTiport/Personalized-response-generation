  ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's nice for me to play in my National Open.   It's an amazing golf course.   It's nice to play with the crowd, French crowd, and I hope it will be a nice week for me. 

Q.   Does it feel like a different year for you this year knowing that you're now coming in here as a champion?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, that's a little bit different.   I take a lot of pleasure on the golf course the last few years, and I'm happy my family will be here and my friends.   No, I enjoy this week, but not too much pressure for me because it's in France. 

Q.   Have you noticed the difference of people paying more attention to you now with the victory under your belt? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I think it's nice for the young players, I think it's nice to have some good, young players in French.   But no, I don't look at that.   I just think about my game and my work and I don't think about what happened outside the golf course. 

Q.   Do you feel good about your game, because you played well in Germany last week. 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I feel good, my game is better.   My long game is better, and no, I hope I will be good for this week. 

Q.   What do you think of the actual course, does it favour you? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I like the course.   I think it's one of the best places to play here, it's in the best condition and I think it's a good course for me.   I love to play here, yeah.
