Q. Great playing out there.  Topsy turvy at times.  Describe your round.ALEXANDER LEVY: I started really bad.  I think the first par-5 was very difficult and I make 7.  I was upset at myself because a start like that, when you know it will be really difficult, is not a good way to start.  I was just thinking to be patient and to play the shot by shot and the shot on a good spot and I think it's what I do today.Q. This afternoon the scores are not as good as they were in the morning.  Some guys got to 7-under.  1-under looks good going into the weekend.ALEXANDER LEVY: This week I say if I finish under par, I will be with the champagne Sunday night.  At this time I was 1-under and I hope I will stay like that all the weekend.Q. Anything about the game plan on the weekend change or is it all the same?  Is the golf course changing as the week is going on?ALEXANDER LEVY: I think I played the golf course this afternoon like I will this weekend.  That was good things.  I know what shot I need to do and I think I will have more difficult and tricky pin position and some tees on the back for the weekend.
