Q. Well played today.  Happy with a round of 68?
ALEXANDER LEVY: I played a good round of golf.  It's funny because I missed some short ones and I holed some long ones, so it's a funny game, we know that.  I'm really pleased what I did today.
Q. A nice run around the turn there, 9, 10 and 12, especially 12.
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, I missed like four short ones in a row and I holed like eight metres on 9, and that's helped me to do a nice back nine.  Yeah, it was a good stretch, and I played good golf today.  It was tough conditions, and 4-under in these conditions is really good.
Q. I was going to ask, the conditions probably very different from the first three days.  How difficult did they make it out there?
ALEXANDER LEVY: It was very tough.  Sometimes you have three clubs of wind and it was into.  It was very tough to control.  No, I promise you, it was not an easy day.
Q. Nice way to finish on 18.
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, I think I holed a good putt, and I take my revenge.  Two years ago, I make four putts from this place, and I make one putt today.  So it's a good feeling.
Q. How many positives can you take from this week going into the next few weeks?
ALEXANDER LEVY: I think it's good, I shoot 16-under in four days, played solid and hole some putts.  I'm really positive with the way I played today.  I think it's good and I just need to work and to progress.  I think I am in a good way.
