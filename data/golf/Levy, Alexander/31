Q.   Thoughts on today?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   I played very well.   I'm very happy.   It was great for me to play with a fantastic player.   I like to play with fantastic players, I'm very happy.

Q.   Ernie helped put you at ease, last group out on the weekend. 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's nice to play with him, very happy.   It was unbelievable, the weather was good, because at the start‑‑ it was perfect to play golf in.   It's a good day. 

Q.   You haven't been in this position before, so how was it in terms of nerves right at the start, knowing that you had the delay and started late? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It was tough, but I like this position.   I practiced for that and I'm happy to be in this position for tomorrow. 

Q.   Do you find you're a better player when there is that kind of spotlight on you, when you are right at the top and playing well?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's true, I like to play in the top, I prefer this position.   It's true, it's a good position.   I want to be like that all the time. 

Q.   Sometimes when it's a first time, you get that bit nervous and you don't play your natural game?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It's true, but today I keep my natural game and I take a very good time on the course, and I think it was a good day and I try to do the same tomorrow and we'll see what happens. 
I don't know what happens tomorrow, but I go to make the job like today, and play golf on a golf course in good condition and I am happy.
