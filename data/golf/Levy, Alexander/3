 Q.  How does that sound?  
ALEX LEVY: I'm really, really happy with what I did today.  It was very tough on the course, and I managed myself to keep my mind in a good way and that was the most important thing I did today.   
I'm so so glad for me, and it was very tough.   
 Q.  What aspects of your game were you pleased most about this week?  
ALEX LEVY: I think I don't drive my best but I managed to play really well my iron shot, and also my short game was really good.  So that's good.  And I work a lot the last two weeks, so it's nice when you see you can work and you win a tournament after.  That brings you some confidence and also show you how to win the tournament.   
 Q.  Defending in China next week.  This gives you a whole heap of confidence going into that.  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, for sure.  I defend my title next week, so I will keep quiet tonight, just enjoy a bit, and be ready for next week.  But first I will enjoy this victory and we will see what happens next week.   
 Q.  Looking firmly ahead, Ryder Cup on the agenda?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, like what I say, I don't change.  Too many good players and it's nice, I just need to follow what I did the last four months and we will see.  But I don't have that in my mind.  Just work and enjoy and play my best.
