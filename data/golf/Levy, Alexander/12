Q. How was that?
ALEXANDER LEVY: It was good.  It was easy conditions today, so low scoring, but I played good golf today.  It's nice to do a Top-10 this week.  It's a little bit tough because I missed on the last but I'm really pleased with what I did.
Q. What was the key to the game out there today?
ALEXANDER LEVY: I think the putting was the key because you've got a lot of position of birdies, so you need to be careful on a few holes, like 17, and don't make a mistake.  Pleased with what I did today.
Q. Obviously with the Rolex Series, pleasing, as well?
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, for sure.  I'm working good, and the last few weeks, something bad happened to me, so I don't play that much golf, so I'm really pleased with what I did today, so that's nice.
