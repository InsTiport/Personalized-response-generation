 Q.  How have you managed the joint-lowest round of the week today?  
ALEXANDER LEVY: It's nice.  I'm really happy.  I was very disappointed this morning when I wake up because I watch what happened in France and that's very bad, again a very bad story for French people, and I was very disappointed.   
So I said, okay, come on, today just have fun and enjoy your day, because a lot of trouble was in France, and I played really good.  The difference with the first two days was I putt great, I make a lot of putts.  When you putt well, the scoring comes, and that's the big difference.   
 Q.  You were so enthusiastic coming into this event, as well, after what happened last year.  I imagine those first two days were very frustrating, weren't they?  
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, because I played really good, and I don't make one putt during two days.  And after, I come in a little bit upset and I lost the head, like yesterday on the back nine, I make a few mistakes, a few bogeys, a few double-bogeys.  But the game was there.   
And today, I make a few putts on the three first holes, and good thinking and that's the difference.  Because today was really tough with the wind.  Some holes was very difficult, and I hit some good shots.  That's the key of the day.   
 Q.  I appreciate you're still a long way back but at the same time, you can push onto a good finish now.  
ALEXANDER LEVY: Yeah, it's nice to shoot 9-under every day.  It's my lowest score of the year, and it's nice for The Race to Dubai next week and for the start of the season for next year.
