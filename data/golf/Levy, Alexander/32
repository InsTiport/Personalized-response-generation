Q.   What are your thoughts after today's round? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   I'm very happy to play this one today, laid very well.   I missed a few shots off the tee but I take a good time on the course and I played very, very well today and I'm very happy.

Q.   Sounds like you told yourself to be patient, just to let it happen?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, yeah, I stayed very patient, because two weeks ago, I played well in Austria, but the second round, I miss a few shots and I didn't play very well the second round, and today I'm very happy to play well today. 

Q.   Is that all part of experience, learning what to do and repeating it the next time around?
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It's true, I take a few experience, and it's nice to progress on that and to play like that with the experience. 

Q.   How is the course playing today compared to the first day, because the scores are not quite as low? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, yeah, a little bit more wind, it's more windy, and the green are more hard, and when you are in the rough, it's tough to stop the ball and on the chipping, it's more tough because the ball runs on the green and it's difficult to make a spin. 

Q.   I guess those greens are baked hard now in this kind of sunshine? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, the weather is perfect and I hope it will be nice during the weekend.

Q.   What are your thoughts for the weekend?   Positive, I guess? 
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's positive.   I've just got to play my golf and take a lot of good time on the course, and we'll see what happens.
