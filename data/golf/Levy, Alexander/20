 Q.   What are your thoughts on a second round 70?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, good 70.   Well, I'm happy because it's not my best golf but I managed good the golf course.   No, it's always good to play 70 on this golf course.   It's a very difficult golf course.   It's warm and it's difficult and you have to hit like that at the end.   
No, very happy and tomorrow I go to play in the final group, and that's nice, and to finish the year, I'm really happy to be in this position for the rest of the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Is it difficult to maintain concentration and focus over fiveâ€‘hours plus out in the heat?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's very difficult, especially when it's the end of the season, and the last four tournaments were very big tournaments.   And to be focused on this one is very difficult.   I try to enjoy and to focus shot by shot.   
   
 Q.   You're looking forward to some time off.   Have you planned any way to celebrate your wonderful year?     
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, I don't know where but I go to celebrate.   The most time will be to take time home with family and with friends and be to the gym, because I need to come back a little bit more strong next year.
