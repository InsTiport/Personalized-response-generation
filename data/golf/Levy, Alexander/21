 Q.   Thoughts on that first round?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Very good day today, no bogeys, I think that's good.   I played some good shot.   I was a little bit lucky on some shots, but that's part of the game.   I'm very happy with this 4‑under today.   
   
 Q.   I'm told when you were on the range prior to the round, things were not going that well?  
ALEXANDER LEVY:   No, it was too warm for me.   It was not that good.   Yesterday was very good, Pro‑Am day was good.   But this morning I felt a little bit not comfortable, but I keep trying to do the best on the golf course, and it's true today, I was a little bit lucky, hit the tree and come back on the fairway.   But tomorrow, it could be different, I'm not going to have this luck during all the week.  
   
 Q.   Too warm for you?   How hot was it out on the course?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   It was tough.   It's very tough because I don't like to play with the glasses and you need to keep the glasses out there.   And when you stay on the golf course, it's very warm and the sun hurt a lot and it's very difficult to play in these conditions.   But I prefer to play in these conditions than cold and rain.   
   
 Q.   Are you enjoying being involved in the Nedbank with all this history, prestige and everything around?   
ALEXANDER LEVY:   Yeah, it's an amazing place, amazing golf course.   For me, it's amazing to be there.   For me it's more the last tournament of the year than the first tournament of the year.   But I'm still enjoying and I know after this week I have five weeks holidays, and I'm thinking only to take pleasure on the golf course and to do my best during the four days.
