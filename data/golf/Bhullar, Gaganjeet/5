 Q.   Every point is vital; how important was the win for you?  
GAGANJEET BHULLAR:   It was very important.   I got off to a really good start.   I was fully focused.   Throughout the last two days I was striking the ball really good.   I was just waiting for this time to come, and I think my positivity and migrate attitude really gave me what I had today.  
   
 Q.   After yesterday's round, what did Thongchai tell the team?   
GAGANJEET BHULLAR:   The guys were told just to go out there and give our best, and at the end of the day, it's a game and we all guys are playing for the love of the game and everybody is playing really well today.   Even Nicholas Fung got off to a really good start, and right now Anirban has a really good opportunity to seal the match.   
The guys are looking really strong coming down the stretch.   Siddikur is playing good, a couple of the Asian guys are up, and just hoping for the best.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure it wasn't easy playing and looking at the scoreboard.   
GAGANJEET BHULLAR:   Trust me, I just kept telling myself that this is the only opportunity I've got.   Just going to give my hundred per cent and trust me, today I gave about 200 per cent to myself.
