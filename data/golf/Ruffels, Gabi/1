Q. You played well at the U.S. Women's Am, and now here you are playing on the world stage in the LPGA at this major championship.  How does it compare?  This is the first time you've been here?
GABI RUFFELS:   Yeah, I mean it was a great experience at the U.S. Am, all the pressure and expectation, and I handled it pretty well.  This is a different stage, best in the world out here, so it's just a great experience and I'm always trying to learn as much as I can.
Q. You're pretty close to home, aren't you -- you live about 20 minutes away?
GABI RUFFELS:   20 minutes away, yeah.
Q. That's nice, being able to stay in your own bed and come to this tournament.
GABI RUFFELS:   Yeah, it's really weird but it's kind of nice though.  My parents moved here two years ago and we live out at Toscana Country Club, and all the members are rooting me on.  It feels a little like a home tournament.  It's awesome.
Q. Is there anything that you're learning from this experience this week?
GABI RUFFELS:   Obviously always learning a lot, especially playing with the best in the world.  I've played with Katherine Kirk and Christina Kim today and obviously they have had some pretty amazing resum√©s.  So just trying to pick up as much as I can.
Q. Seems like it's going to be head-to-head with you and Rose this week.  How much are you looking at the leaderboards, or are you focusing on the big goal of playing well this week?
GABI RUFFELS:   Yeah, for sure just taking one round at a time.  Kind of struggled in the middle but I knew if I could stay steady and finish strong, I'd be doing okay.  It's just fun to be out here.  I'm having so much fun.
