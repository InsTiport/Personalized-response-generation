 Q.  What are your thoughts on shooting a 64 at a course you've certainly enjoyed the success on in the past?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: I had a great day.  Good start on the first four holes, low score, it's always good to start like that.  And I just play -- my game was good and I holed some good putts today, so 64.   
 Q.  Since there are such wonderful memories here, does it make it one of your favourite courses?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it's definitely one of my favourite courses.   
 Q.  Does that help when you step into a tournament knowing that you've had that success in the past?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it helps a little bit.  It's all about how you hit the ball at the end, but it is starting to be very, very good.  So I hope to do well this weekend.   
 Q.  Is that what's making the difference, the form on the greens?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, of course.   
 Q.  Has that been a lot of hard work then to get to this kind of stage to get the rewards?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I changed my putter a few months ago.  I was a little bit in trouble the first few weeks, but now I can see on the green that I hole more putts from ten feet and that makes a difference.   
 Q.  Sometimes changing any type of club has immediate dividends.  Do you find that you have to work that little bit harder to get into the right rhythms?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: No, just be patient.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts coming into this event, given that it is a Final Series; were you thinking, big push to the end of the season?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: I was just thinking that my season hasn't been great, and I haven't played as many tournaments.  So I was counting on The Final Series to maybe improve my ranking.   
 Q.  Absolutely, because you appreciate just how many points and ranking points are on offer?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah.  Thank you.
