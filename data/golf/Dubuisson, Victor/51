 Q.   Please tell how pleasing a round that is in windswept conditions.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     It was difficult today.   The wind, it's difficult to see the wind sometimes because of the trees.   I missed a few short putts, but the greens are very difficult to read.   
   
 Q.   So are you pleased with a score like that in these conditions?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     Yeah, very, very pleasing.   Very pleasing.   
   
 Q.   Given that this is on the back of such a wonderful finish to last year and your victory, how are your aims, your resolutions, your targets for 2014?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     I don't really have any target in mind.   I just focus on every shot and play shot after shot.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel a better, more confident player on the strength of what you've achieved last year?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     Yeah, yeah, I feel more confident on the course, especially when I'm in a difficult situation, I think a little bit differently, like I can make a few birdies.   So I don't think the same as before.   
   
 Q.   So it's one of those things of knowing that you've been there before, knowing the experience?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     Yeah, yeah, exactly.   
   
 Q.   It's lovely to start the year in this kind of fashion, a tournament where there's no cut, guaranteed prize money at the end, four days?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     Yeah, it's good, but you still need to don't think about the fact that it's four rounds and no cut.   You just need to focus and to try to watch the top of the leaderboard.  
   
 Q.   Nice after the break to have a guaranteed four days?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:     Yeah, it's good to start the season off and to see how the game is after the Christmas break .
