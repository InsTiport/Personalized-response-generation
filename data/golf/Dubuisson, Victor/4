Q. A round of 68, what did you do particularly well today?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: I've been very good with my driver.  I didn't miss many fairways, maybe one or two, and you know, here it's the key to play well.
Q. You finished third here last year, one of some good results you've had.  Do you particularly enjoy coming to Sun City?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I really like this course.  I think it suits my long game very well.  I also feel very comfortable on the greens.  But otherwise, you can have very good days.  The thing here is you really have to keep the ball in the fairway.  If the driver starts to go wrong, you can do some really high scores.
But for the moment, that's what I focus on is just keeping the ball in the fairway, even if sometime I leave me a long second shot.
Q. You finished 30 at the Dunhill Links recently, and that secured your card for next year.  Is it now just free-wheeling to get into the DP World Tour Championship?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: The goal this week is really to qualify for Dubai.  So I think it's a good way to start the tournament.
Q. Great start for you today, opening round 68.  Just give us your thoughts.
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I played very well today.  I kept the ball in the fairway.  That was the key of the score.  I made some important putts, as well.
Q. Obviously this is a golf course you've done well at in the last two years.  What is it about here that you enjoy so much or that suits your game?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it suits my game, my long game really good.  I also feel very comfortable on the greens.
Q. You had a great result at the Alfred Dunhill Links and another good performance here would see you get into Dubai, as well.
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it's only the first round.  It's great to start like this because the birdies are not easy to do on this course.
