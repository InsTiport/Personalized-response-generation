Q. Your driving seems to be very, very good over the first two days of this tournament?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, yeah, the driver of course here is the key if you want to play well, and yeah, today I didn't miss many fairways, maybe one or two, and I played very solidly in the wind.
Q. It's been a good end of season for you.  You got your card secured with the Alfred Dunhill.  Are you playing with a little bit more freedom now that you haven't got that to worry about?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Of course.  Also I just try to play as good as I can each day, day after day, and especially on this course, you've got to have a very solid game to do some good scoring.
Q. 73 on The Race to Dubai.  How much would it mean to you for a good finish and to play next week inside the Top 60?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, of course, it's the goal of the week to play Dubai because it's been five years in a row that I've played the Dubai final.  So yeah, of course I think about it.
Q. You played the course in calm conditions yesterday and windy conditions today, so the weekend shouldn't be too much of a problem?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Let's hope so.
