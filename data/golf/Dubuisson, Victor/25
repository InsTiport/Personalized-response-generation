 Q.   Your thoughts on the first three days here.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I played very well.   The greens are very difficult and with the grain and really tough to get the speed on the greens.   
So today was okay.   First nine, I felt like I was hitting some really good shots.   But you know, I didn't manage to get the ball really close to the hole.   And then on the back nine, I made some good birdies, 5â€‘under, very happy.  
   
 Q.   That was a terrific back nine and no doubt you've seen your position in the tournament as things stand?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I think the course is not easy.   The greens are getting dry and on the weekend, everything can happen.   So tomorrow, hope I can do the same.   
   
 Q.   Is there something special about this course, the way that it plays that suits you after last year?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, nothing special.   Just try to play my best and to play the best that I can.   Nothing special on the course.   I just try to be good on the greens.
