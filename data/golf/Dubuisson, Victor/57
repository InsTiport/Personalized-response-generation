Q.   Tell us a round of 66 today. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I played very solid, same as yesterday.   Putting was good.   It's not a too difficult course like everybody say, but there are a few holes that you need to be careful and the greens are very difficult to read.   Out of the fairway, difficult to focus.

Q.   And the hayfever troubled you on the back nine‑‑ you took the green out of the equation; tell me about that one. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   On the 7th, it was a great shot.   Could have been a birdie anyway, because the ball didn't get to the hole too quick I think.   But yeah, it was a great shot.   And the approach shot on 18, around ten feet that I didn't make, so I think it was like the little bonus. 

Q.   I know it's only the halfway stage but that kind of bonus really catapulted you with the leaders, so that's good.
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, of course. 

Q.   The hayfever, you really do seem to be struggling, is there nothing you can do or take? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, I'm taking strong medicine.   Especially on the sixth hole, I was looking for a ball in the rough, and then started to get(hayfever).
