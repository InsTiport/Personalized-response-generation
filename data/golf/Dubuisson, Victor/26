  VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I look forward to play this week.   I hope I will enjoy it, especially because I won last year and first victory on Tour, it's important.

Q.   So when you step through the gates here this week, did those memories come flooding back? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, coming back here, it's about memories from last year. 

Q.   Have you used those memories across what has been an exciting year for you? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I played well this year, and it's been a good season, and I hope I can finish it well here. 

Q.   Sometimes when you're feeling down perhaps or not having the best of rounds, do you think back to Turkey and think, I played that so well that year, that time and that really gives you the incentive, the impetus to play better? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, sometimes, sometimes I think about last year when I won.   Yeah, it's a good motivation. 

Q.   Tell me how you are, because I know it didn't work out for you in Shanghai last week and you've arrived here without your clubs and without your gear at the moment?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I feel better.   Body is okay.   I hope I will get my luggage tonight and be ready for tomorrow. 

Q.   And was that your back last week in Shanghai? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   That's eased; you've had physio? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, yeah.   Had physio the last few days.

Q.   Feeling 100 per cent now? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I feel better.   I feel better. 

Q.   What are your expectations this week? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I expect I will just try to do the best I can and I will see the results the end of the week.
