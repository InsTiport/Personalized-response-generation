 Q.   How does it feel to be leading halfway?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It feels great, especially because I didn't play that well at the BMW Masters, the first tournament of The Final Series.   Yeah, I did work very hard on my game and my putting the last weeks, so it's been a good month and yeah, I've played well.   I just missed three putts I could have made, but 7â€‘under is a very low score.   It's good to be leading starting the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Just about everything working in your game now on a course that you like?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, yeah, everything is working.   Everything is working very well.   The course is kind of short but tricky, so I need to keep the ball on the fairway, because the rough are very high.   
But yeah, as I said, I'm happy about my game.   I just hope it will keep going this weekend.  
   
 Q.   I know it is only halfway, but is it all the more special knowing which players are beneath you at the moment?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, there are very good players in this tournament, the top of the world and Tiger who is playing another game, a different sport.   But yeah, it's also a good feeling to see that I can lead a big tournament like this, even if it's halfway, and the more important is coming now.
