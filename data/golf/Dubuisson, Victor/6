 Q.  How special is a round of 64 around the Earth Course?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: It's a great score.  It's my best score to date.  I've played well, made the good putts at the right time.  I'm happy to be able to putt it in the hole.   
 Q.  The eagle at the fifth, tell me about that.  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it's sometimes it goes in -- I made a lucky bogey on the next hole, so it kind of like set it up.   
 Q.  But at the same time, when that does happen, do you think, spirit is lifted, this is going to be ^  a very good day?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it's a big bonus, but you know on the next hole you've got to focus again, and I was quite excited.   
 Q.  You have some excellent results over this golf course.  What is it about the Earth Course that suits you?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: It's just a course I like.  It's long.  You have to carry the ball long.  It's target golf.  Long game is very important, putting.  I just like the way it sets up.   
 Q.  Tell us about your caddie, fresh with you in current tee, a good result in ^  South Africa and you're playing well here?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, he was a big help for me last week because he's caddying for a South African guy, and he knew a lot about the altitude and the difference in South Africa.  He saved me a few shots, changing my clubs, and this week he's been great, too.   
 Q.  Is that one of those relationships that just works straightaway; a caddie that you got on with very much as a person?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I think because he saved me a few shots the first round, it gave me a lot of confidence.
