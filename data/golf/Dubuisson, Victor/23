Q.   What is your verdict on this week, sir? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It's a good week.   I didn't start playing well‑‑ I played okay, but over the weekend, it's difficult to compete when you are one score an level par to be competing for the lead.   No, I'm happy.

Q.   When did you feel that you might have a chance on the final day when Martin came back to the field? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I felt I had a chance but I didn't make the putt I had to make.   But, you know, it's just one or two shots.   No, I'm happy about my game, yeah.   That's more important.

Q.   I'm told you had an operation during the off‑season, so is it all the nicer to come back with a good score when you haven't had the ideal preparation?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I haven't played at all for five weeks before this tournament.   I arrived on Wednesday night because of surgery.   So, you know, I didn't know what to expect.   But after a few holes, I just got some feeling again on my swing and on the putting.   It's good.   It's good for the next tournament. 

Q.   And can I ask you about the man who is leading, Gary Stal; tell us about him as a fellow Frenchman. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, he's a good friend.   He's really a great player.   I knew this would happen.   He deserved to win the tournament.   I don't know what he's doing on 18, but he's a guy that got big nerves, so he's not going to fail.
