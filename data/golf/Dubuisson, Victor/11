Q. What's your verdict on a very hard-fought match?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: That was a great match.  None of us really gave anything away.  I thought, you know, we got the advantage after I chipped in on 17, but he made a great chip there.  It was a really good match.
Q. And your thoughts, you don't seem to be feeling at your best by any means.
VICTOR DUBUISSON: We played really well I think.  I think we scored 8-under par which is a really good score.  They played really well.  It was a good match.  It's a good half-point I think.
Q. And how is your knee?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: My knee is fine.  I'm going to the physio and fix it for tomorrow.
Q. Very brave, going through in this heat.  You probably didn't want to go all the distance, did you?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: No, but Victor, he plays like a rock star.  He is a rock star.  I just love playing with him.
