 Q.   Thoughts on the two days?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I played very well.   Some good putts today, and yeah, I'm very pleased with the 67.   
   
 Q.   Does this mean you've grown to know how to play this course and the game is just getting better, recovering nicely after last week?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, exactly.   I played better and better, and as I said, when I make a few putts, that makes a big difference.   My long game is very good and scoring is also very good here.   You know if you're not 4‑ or 5‑under each day, you won't have a chance.   
   
 Q.   What are you doing well?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   My game is good.   There's nothing in particular really.   I just try to do my best and if I do well, I do well.   It was nice today.  
   
 Q.   You say you know you have to shoot low.   Does that help you with that kind of attitude going out there?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, no, I just have the same attitude as all the time.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of your current position on that board?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Well, I think I will be a little too far for the win.   But I didn't play very well since the beginning of the season, so starting to make the cut again and then putting me in good position for Top‑10, Top‑5, it's what I try to do now.   And when my game will be okay, I'm going to expect better.   
   
 Q.   That must be nice, knowing that you're making that kind of progress?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What is it that you've done to make the progress?   Hard work?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Just be patient.
