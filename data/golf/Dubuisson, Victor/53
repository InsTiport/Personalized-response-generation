Q.   A round that started with four birdies ended in a 66.   How good did that one feel? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It felt great.   Played really well today.   Had a couple of putts miss like one meter, disappointment.   But I had some great putts, as well.   And I hit the ball very good this week.   So I hope it will be the same tomorrow. 

Q.   When we spoke shortly after your victory last week, you were almost in shock.   Has it sunk in yet? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, not yet.   Probably after the World Cup in two weeks‑‑ I mean, after the next week.   No, I didn't really enjoy maybe the victory because I was so focused on this week right after the tournament.   I would have loved to enjoy it more, but I'm so focused on my game right now that I don't‑‑ I try to don't think about last week. 

Q.   How much did you learn about yourself as a golfer, beating a world‑class field, in the style that you did coming back from your lead being taken away and then getting it back?   How much did you learn from that experience? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I've learned that on the course with a good field, you have to stay very patient.   That's what I learned last week, and that's what I tried to do, especially on the front nine when I wasn't playing very well.   And I did the same yesterday and today when my round could have turned in the wrong way after one or two missed putts.   Now I try to stay very patient on the course.
