  VICTOR DUBUISSON: Tomorrow I'll just try to do my best.  If the putts goes in, it can be a good day.   Q.  How do you cope with the extra attention that's on you this year?  How do you deal with that extra scrutiny and attention on you?  VICTOR DUBUISSON: I just try to focus on my game.  And I try to be more relaxed, especially when I'm on the course.  Because I think it's the best way in this type of big tournaments to do well.   Q.  Do you like the extra attention or do you prefer to slip under the radar and go unnoticed?  How do you play better?  VICTOR DUBUISSON: I don't really watch around.  I just focus really on my game.  If the crowd is big, it's not really a big difference.  I really focus on my game on the course.   Q.  Is it true that you changed your phone number to escape all the media attention and all that, after your win earlier in the year?  VICTOR DUBUISSON: No.  I've changed because -- no, I didn't change.  It's just that I got rid of my French number, because I don't live in France.  So that's the only -- like I started to -- like I sent the letter to arrange, to quit the number, two months before I went.  It just happened like --   Q.  (Inaudible.)  VICTOR DUBUISSON: In Andorra.  Since long time, five years now.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  VICTOR DUBUISSON: Normal things, like going to the cinema.  I'm just a normal person.  I'm just a normal player.  I play the best I can do, depending on which type of course we play.  I'm just -- nothing special, you know.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  VICTOR DUBUISSON: No, Jimmy is a good guy.  We played two days at the U.S. Open, as well.  He's a really nice guy, very simple, you know, very quiet, quiet, like you don't do too much.  He's very, very good.  I like this guy.   Q.  Do you spend time off the course?  VICTOR DUBUISSON: No, no, because we don't play -- he plays PGA, I play Europe.  But a really great guy.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  VICTOR DUBUISSON: I don't know.  I'm just telling you he's a good guy.  That's the only thing I can tell.
