 Q.  Winning for Turkey the second time in the last three years; the back nine, you were playing well, Kiradech was playing well, Jaco was playing well.  Looking back, why were you able to come out victorious?  What was your mind-set and strategy?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: After the first hole when I had a double-bogey, and my short putt that I missed on 7, I was not really thinking about winning anymore.  Because this year, it's not been really great for me personally.  I was just thinking, okay, do your best.  Don't care about what Kiradech and Jaco and McIlroy are doing.  Just try to put your mind back and focus on your game.   
 Q.  In your mind, is it harder to win for the second time than it is the first time?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Definitely.
