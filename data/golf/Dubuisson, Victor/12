Q. Your thoughts on the 65 to start here.
VICTOR DUBUISSON: It's been a long time I shoot a low score to start a tournament.  Usually I play so-so the first two rounds and I do well on the weekend where I make some good results.  But to start with 7-under, it feels great for confidence for the rest of the tournament.
Q. Is this simply carrying on the form we saw in Turkey?  Sometimes it's hard to replicate that form?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, exactly, it's carrying on what I did in Turkey.  I feel so great and I feel so good on the greens.  You know, when I read the line good, I feel like the putt can only go in the hole, and you know, you don't have this feeling much time during the year.  So yeah, it feels great.
Q. I know everybody in this game works hard at it, but at the same time, when you're playing at this kind of level, do you feel that it just rolls and it's free-wheeling and just goes from one week to the next?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, exactly, you never know what can happen with golf.  Sometimes you play well and you shoot a bad score and sometimes it's just everything about the short game.
Q. Did you celebrate?  Did you go away and have a little bit of fun and enjoy the victory?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: No, not really.  I stayed focused for the rest of The Final Series.  I will enjoy the victory of Turkey after Dubai.
Q. There's still a lot to play for.  Are you looking at the ranking list and what's possible?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, exactly, with this format of points, of extra points for The Final Series, if you make some good results, if you make to the top three or a good win, you can jump to the top of The Race to Dubai.
So I just want to stay focused until the end of Dubai.
