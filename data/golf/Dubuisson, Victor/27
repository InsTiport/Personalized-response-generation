  VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It was pretty good.   I played really well the four days.   Today, I mean my long game was really, really, really good.
I still missed a lot of putts that could have made the difference, but 66 is really a good round.
I had a lot of birdies, so it was really a nice round.

Q.   I guess the form on the greens was so much better today perhaps than other days to make this score. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Form on the greens was so‑so.   I only made the short birdie putts.   But I think during the week I lost so many points on the greens. 
But I'm really confident because long game is really, really great now.   It's good for the next‑‑ for final series tournament.

Q.   When you started the final day did you think you had a chance?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, because the course is not easy.   Greens are getting very firm with the wind.
You know, you never know what can happen the last round.   Guys playing in the last groups, they don't play the same way that I played today, for example.   Today I was very aggressive with my long game. 
Yeah, we never know what can happen.

Q.   I know you wanted to come down here for preparation for the final series as well just to get into the time zone.   You were not feeling particularly well over these days. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I was feeling good, but I don't know what happened.   I had big fever.   I was feeling so bad this morning.   You know, muscle was like hurting. 
But then when I started to play I tried to don't think about it.   Just on the last few holes it (indiscernible) a little bit my game, but I made some good par putts to save.
