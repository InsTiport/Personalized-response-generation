Q.   Did you have to work extra hard out there today? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, it was a good day.   I played really well.   Holed some good putts compared to the other days.   Yeah, I'm very happy about the scoring. 

Q.   What are you feeling about not just this weekend, but the year ahead?   You've achieved so much in the last 14 months.   Are you aware of any expectations or pressures to do even better this season?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No.   I just want to do better for myself.   I don't feel any more pressure.   Golf, it's a sport where sometimes you can have a bad year, or two, three, bad years and then come back.   It's very difficult to keep the same level every year.   So just trying to do my best on every round, every event, and I'll see what happens. 

Q.   When you hear players like Rory McIlroy say that they write down their targets for the year at the start of the year and look forward to trying to meet these; do you feel that you are in that same category? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It's difficult for me to tell how to write, like, okay, this year, my target is to win two majors and I didn't win one yet, or I didn't even win a PGA event. 
You know, first I will try to keep being consistent in my game, my result.   Maybe win one or two events and then I can write down, okay, this year, I have to win a few events.

Q.   If you can match today's round tomorrow, do you think that might be good enough to win? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I saw Kaymer's start these two days, I think I need to put like 10â€‘under tomorrow if I want to have a chance.
