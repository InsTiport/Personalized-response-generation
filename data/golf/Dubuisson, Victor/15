 Q.  You must really love this golf course?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, yeah, I like it a lot.  It's a course that I feel great on it.  Today, 13 was very good, as well as the first two days.  This was really the key for going for a low score.   
 Q.  What have you found this week that perhaps you have not had in recent weeks and months?  What have you found?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Just on the greens.  My long game has been really, really good since the beginning of the year, but my short game was just really, really bad.  I don't know, I changed my putter one month and a half ago.   
 Q.  And are you excited to play in that final group tomorrow?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, very, very excited.   
 Q.  How would you rate your performance on Saturday?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Great performance.  Made just two mistakes today but made some great putts on the back nine.   
 Q.  What do you like so much about this golf course and maybe this region that has provided success for you?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: I just like the course and it's similar to a course I practice on when I'm not playing a tournament.   
 Q.  You're playing in the final group tomorrow with world No. 3 Rory McIlroy.  Do you see this as a great opportunity to measure your game against a strong player like Rory?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, yeah, of course.  I mean, he's obviously the best player in the world since a few years, so it's a great opportunity to get some experience from him.
