b>Q. Tied for low round of the day.  Tell us about your round.VICTOR DUBUISSON: I played really well today.  Every putt I -- greens were not as soft as yesterday as well.  And pin position it was like crazy, you know.  Every hole --
Q. What was the strong point of your game today?  What kept you at level par to get you to that score?VICTOR DUBUISSON: Every part of my game was good.  To shoot under par here, it feels like you shot 6- or 7-under on a normal course.  So every part of your game has to be really strong.  I missed two fairways.  I missed like four greens, I think, five greens, which is very good here.  And I didn't hole any putts for birdie outside five, six feet, between six and 20, 25 feet.  But I was always close to the hole.  And I knew they would probably be really good today.
Q. Happy or relieved with what you shot today?VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, yeah, because you know when you're on the first tee, you know that the next ones are going to be really tough.  And that doing this well you don't have any -- you cannot like -- how do you say?  Not lie down.  Every shot is really difficult, so you need to be focused.  You can't even have like two minutes off.  So, yeah, I'm really happy.
Q. What do you anticipate for tomorrow?VICTOR DUBUISSON: You can't anticipate anything.  I will try to do my best, hit the fairway, hit the greens.  It's not a course where you have to shoot 4- or 5-under to get better on the rank, to get a better position.  So I will just play my game as I did the last three days.
