Q.   Victor, 5-under, 67 in the first round.   Were you pleased with that?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, very pleased.   Played very, very well today.   Made some good putts, and yeah, I don't have to complain about my game today.   Very good.

Q.   You just had an unfortunate bogey on the last hole, but otherwise were the conditions suitable for you today?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, good conditions.   Little bit of wind.   It was good.

Q.   You haven't played a lot in the United States this year so far.   Are you planning an extended stay with the Masters and match play coming up?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I would play The Players, but then I don't really know what my schedule is.
