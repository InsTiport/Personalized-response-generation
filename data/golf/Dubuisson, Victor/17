Q. Good round.  Missed a few fairways but great iron play.  Was it your iron play that got you your round today?VICTOR DUBUISSON: Definitely.  I played really stellar golf.  Just on No. 3, I made a mistake on the distance, and I got the bogey on that hole.  Then it's, of course, when you're 1-over after three holes, the 2nd hole par 5, you don't have many birdie opportunities here.  It's so long, and when you miss the fairway, it's very difficult to go on the green then. Yeah, my iron game was really good, and I made some good putts to save par.Q. Players yesterday were talking about the greens being firm.  Were they as firm as you thought?  And did it help you, the firmness, on your third shot on 18?VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I mean, personally, I prefer to play on firm greens because the ball just don't move, you don't get too much speed.  I think it's playing a little more difficult than last year, especially with the pin position we got today.  It was much easier.
