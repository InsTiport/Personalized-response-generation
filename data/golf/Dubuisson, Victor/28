 Q.   In the mix of things today.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I played good, as yesterday, but all my putts don't want to go in.  
It's this kind of day.   Long game was really, really good, but didn't make any putts.   I mean, I made few putts from like five feet, but between three and ten feet everything was lipping out.   So disappointed in that.  
   
 Q.   That was five birdies in the opening seven holes.   You must've thought you can get back in the competition.  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I thought I could get back in the competition, but unfortunately on the back nine nothing, all my putts lip the hole.  
I was like, Okay, this is not the day.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?   You were somewhat tired on arrival.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I'm okay.   I'm okay.   I hope tomorrow will be a better day.  
   
 Q.   Are you adapting, sleeping better after a couple days here?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah.   I need few more days, I think.  
   
 Q.   What is your impression of this course now that you've had a chance to see it over two days?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It's very good.   It's very technical course.   You need to have a good strategy and place the ball on the right place on the green.  
Yeah, it's a good course.  
   
 Q.   What do you need to do over the weekend?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Make some putts.
