Q.   Excellent round of golf in different conditions and conditions different every single day?
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, conditions are different.   Today the greens, well, it was okay.   It was not as firm as yesterday, but I don't know why, but today‑‑ my long game, I never hit the ball so well, but my short game was really, really good today.   Made some birdies on the par5. 

Q.   So the scoring shots are working for you, important for the finals round? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, it's good, I think maybe I will be one or two shots from the lead.   It's good.   I really made some good up‑and‑downs today to stay in contention, and I'm happy about it because on the course, you can use your mind to make some birdies.   The greens are very difficult to read.
