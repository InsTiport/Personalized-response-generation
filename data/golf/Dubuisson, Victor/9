Q. Victor, everyone knows you're skilled in match play, you showed the world what you're capable of in 2014.  But against Justin Thomas, you must be pleased with how you played?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, I played very well today.  It's a really tough course.  The way I felt it today, I started really well with birdie on No. 1.  And then I was not happy about my game.  But I realize on the back nine that the course is so difficult with the greens, they are very, very dry and hard.  And it's a course you win a lot of holes with par.  So I kind of used a little bit my experience.
Q. You've taken out one American, but you've got another tomorrow, Jordan Spieth, who also closed out his match 3 and 2.  How do you think your game shapes up against Jordan?
VICTOR DUBUISSON: I think I will have to upgrade my game tomorrow, if I want to have a chance.  Yeah, I think against Jordan, par isn't going to be enough to win the hole.  I will go on the range now and practice a little for tomorrow.
