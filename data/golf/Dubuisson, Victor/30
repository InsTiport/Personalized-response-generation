 Q.   Two matches, two wins, both 3 & 2.   How do you feel about the way you've played so far?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I played very well.   I didn't find my speed on the greens yet but long game is good.   
   
 Q.   You played obviously well in The Ryder Cup and you played well at the Accenture Match Play.   What is it about match play that brings the best out of you?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I don't know, I'm just playing my own stroke play.   I don't watch the guy I'm playing with.   So maybe that's why I do well in match play.   
   
 Q.   You talked about how helpful Graeme McDowell was in your Ryder Cup experience.   Did you learn anything at The Ryder Cup that you can use here at the Match Play?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Well, we played together.   Yeah, I learned a little bit from him.   But at The Ryder Cup it was more‑‑ I wasn't playing against him.   
So I know he's the best match player, like one of the best match players in the world.   Yeah, what I can say is that with him, I can see that everything is about playing I think.
