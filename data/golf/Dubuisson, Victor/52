  RODDY WILLIAMS:   Victor, very well played out there today, 11 birdies, that was an incredible round, very well played.   You must be delighted.  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, very delighted.   
RODDY WILLIAMS:   The hole museum massive for you at the moment, you're holing everything.  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   On the green, yeah, my putting was very good today.   I didn't hole very long putts but I played good between four and ten feet.   
RODDY WILLIAMS:   On the back of the victory last week, you're going to be feeling very confident going into tomorrow.  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, very confident about tomorrow.   I will try to do my best.   And you know, sometimes it goes your way, sometimes not, but I will do the same as today and the first two rounds.   I will try to do my best on every shot and then we'll see.  
RODDY WILLIAMS:   And you're obviously going to be playing with Henrik in the final round, are you looking forward to playing with him?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I don't know, CaÃ±izares didn't‑‑  
   
 Q.   CaÃ±izares is 13‑under?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I'm very happy to play with Henrik tomorrow, he's a great guy and he's the best player of the year, so I'm very excited about playing with him tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Of the 11 birdies that you made, which one did you enjoy the most?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   The one after my double‑bogey.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you hit?   You had a pitching wedge for your second shot.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   What did you hit on that hole?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   A wedge.   
   
 Q.   And tell us about the first hole, you really seemed very upset after making the bogey on the first hole.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, I was not upset.   You know, I hit a good 3‑wood.   Just a little bit to the left‑‑ sorry.   Sorry, I'm tired.   
No, I just made a good shot, and out of the bunker, had a bad lie and tried to do my best.   I didn't hit very good, but it's just a bogey.   I had lots of birdie holes then, so I was not feeling bad after this bogey.   
   
 Q.   A lot of the attention is being placed on the likes of Stenson, McDowell and the players that can win The Race to Dubai.   Do you think you've benefitted from that this week given your form the previous week, the win in Turkey?   Do you think it's helped, the media having the attention on the other players?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, I don't‑‑ you know, I'm okay with this.   Even when I have a lot of attention on me on the course, I'm focused on my game and I don't really watch around me.   I'm fine with this.   
   
 Q.   Is golf easy at the moment?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, it's not easy.   I'm always 120 percent on every shot.   It's not easy at all.   Just that, yeah, I play very well now because I've been practising a lot, and I have the benefit of the way I did practise these last few months, and after the win, of course.   
   
 Q.   What are your energy levels like now with a round to play, particularly after going through what you went through in Turkey last week?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, it's been difficult on a few holes today, especially at the end.   But you know, I try to, as I said, to do my best and tonight I will try to sleep early to have a good night of sleep and tomorrow I will feel good.   
   
 Q.   What is the secret to the way you focus?   Is it breathing or what do you do?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   No, just‑‑ I just think shot after shot and‑‑ no, I don't have any tips or secret to do this.   
   
 Q.   But were you like this with your schoolwork?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   When you were at school, do you focus hard in class?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Well, I stopped school at ten years old, so I don't (laughter) even remember going to school.   
   
 Q.   But you were there, I take it, but you just don't remember it.   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I was at the golf.   I was not at school (laughter).   
   
 Q.   And did anybody mind that you were missing school?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Well, no, I didn't really have family, so you know, I was just doing what I wanted to do and I decided to be a professional at golf when I watched Tiger Woods winning the Masters when he was 21 years old in his first Masters.   So then I said, I don't have any future with school, so I prefer to go to the golf (laughter).   
   
 Q.   You just said that you decided to turn professional as early as 1997 when you saw Tiger winning the Masters.   How satisfying was it to beat Tiger then in Turkey?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I didn't really beat him because it was not like a match‑play.   But you know, Tiger, the thing is, it's going to be very difficult for players to beat Tiger on the World Ranking because in Turkey, he didn't play very well.   His driving was very bad and he still finished like third or fourth.   
So the difference is I had a very good week and he had a very bad week, and there is only a four‑shot difference between him and me.   So it's Tiger, a different sport.   
   
 Q.   If you remain in the Top‑50 in the world you are going to qualify for the Masters next week.   Obviously you want to win this tournament, but how important is it for you to be in that Top‑50 at the end of the year?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   I try to don't think about my win last week.   When I arrived here on Tuesday, I just tried to think about this week, and it's very important for me to play well here, and to be in the Top‑50 in the world after December, because after this tournament, I play in Melbourne and then I don't have anymore tournaments to play.   
The guys on the PGA TOUR, they will play; so I need to play well this week and to stay in my rank now, because guys on the PGA, they will probably play good and so I need to play well this week, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Could you put your finger on exactly what it is that has made you do so well last week in Turkey and here this week?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   The last three months, I've been working very hard on my putting, my short game.   I worked with a new coach since three months and he decided‑‑ compared to the other coach I decided before, he decided don't touch my swing, because he said you have like 16 greens in regulation average on the Tour, but you need to change your putting.   
Everything is good, we just work on the trajectory.   On the range, we try to hit like 15, 20 straight shots.   And then the rest of the practise was on the putting, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What was it in particular about the putting that helped you improve?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   The stroke.   The stroke, yeah, and the way to read the line.   
   
 Q.   What is the name of your new coach, the putting coach?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   BenoÃ®t Ducoulombier.   He used to train GrÃ©gory Havret for like ten years.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk just a little about the creative putt you did on the 16th hole?   Did you want to hit the ball so far away and then the ball was coming back to the hole?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I had no chance to, I had no chance to finish less than four or five feet from the hole.   So I saw the break and I was thinking, okay, that's my only chance to make it, so it made the putt much more easier.   
RODDY WILLIAMS:   Victor, thank you very much.
