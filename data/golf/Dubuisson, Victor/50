Q.   How did that compare today? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Same, same kind of day.   Played really well.   Course was difficult today because of the wind.   The wind was completely different.   But yeah, I played well, and missed a few putts, some short putts again.   But you know, the greens are difficult. 

Q.   The hard holes on day one became easier and the easier ones became harder? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I think it was harder today on the back nine.   The last few holes were more difficult.   I think the wind was‑‑

Q.   Are you very happy with your position going into the weekend? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I'm very happy.   I think I'm one shot, one or two shots from the lead, so in a good position.

Q.   Is there any element of surprise given it is the first tournament of the year? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   What do you mean? 

Q.   First tournament out, you're never entirely sure what to expect. 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, but any tournament, you never know, you never know what to expect.   No, I just try to do my best. 

Q.   Volvo Champions is a different kind of tournament.   You've played with an amateur in your team today.   How was that? 
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   It was good, he played really well, made a few birdies.   No, it was good.   On 17 made a putter putt than me.
