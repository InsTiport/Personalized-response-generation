Q. They were previously unbeaten in three matches and you've thrashed them.GRAEME McDOWELL: We got off to a flyer.  A dream start, really, when you go 3-, 4-up against a pairing like this one.  You really just have to try and keep the pedal to the medal, if you like. It's just been so much fun playing alongside this man the last two days.  I really can't say enough about how talented this kid is, how easy it is to play alongside him.  He might be the best player I've played with since Rory McIlroy, and that's saying a lot.Q. You're playing inspired golf.  Is it inspired by The Ryder Cup?  This thing is just producing this from you?VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it's inspired by The Ryder Cup, and of course by being next to this man since a few days I arrived here.  As I said yesterday, he's brought me so much confidence, and you know, playing into this wind, it was perfect, because I love this kind of weather, and as I said, playing with Graeme is really a dream for me.Q. A word about the crowds?GRAEME McDOWELL: Phenomenal.  I said to Victor going out yesterday, every one of these fans will be cheering and they will be cheering loud and they will be cheering for us.  We have to use them to our advantage.  This is such a big piece of land, you forget how many people there are out here and how passionate they are and how much they love this tournament.  It's a special, special golf tournament.  We're very proud to be part of it. We're in great shape.  We are just going to go cheer the lads in and see if we can get some more blue on the board.  Tomorrow is a big day.  We're looking forward to it.Q. Who would you like to play in singles?  Phil, come on  ...VICTOR DUBUISSON: (Smiling, shrugging shoulders)  Okay, Phil.
