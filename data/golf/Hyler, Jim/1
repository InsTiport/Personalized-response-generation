   JIM HYLER: It's appropriate that we name the remaining spots on our Walker Cup team. As you know, we'll be heading over across the pond in about 10 days for the next Walker Cup match. Obviously our new U.S. Open champion, Kelly Kraft, will be a member of that team. Filling out the next two spots, Jordan Spieth, from Dallas, Texas. Jordan's a new freshman at the University of Texas. And then the final spot, Blayne Barber from Lake City, Florida. Blayne attends Auburn University. So that's our ten-member Walker Cup team. In our news release tonight, we will name two alternates. We haven't notified them yet, so I want to hold that and that will go out in the news release that you get tonight.  
 So filling out our team will be Kelly Kraft, Jordan Spieth and Blayne Barber.
