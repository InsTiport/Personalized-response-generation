Q. Taylor, they jumped on you in the middle of the round there.
TAYLOR WOOD: Yeah.
Q. What was it like seeing all those birdies go in, especially that long one at 12?
TAYLOR WOOD: I mean, tough.  They made some big putts at key times.  So good for them.  Happy for them.  They made the putts you got to make.  They made a big one at 10.  The birdie at 10 was big.  The birdie at 12 was big.
Our miss on 13 was kind of the turning point.  We had a chance to get to 2 down, and with winning 15, really had a good chance to win 16.  They made another big putt there.  They did what you had to do to win.  They made, I don't know --
ANDREW MEDLEY: They won.  We didn't lose.
TAYLOR WOOD: Yeah.
Q. When you guys won 17, you say, hey, we got a real shot here?
ANDREW MEDLEY: I thought we did.  Match play, a lot of it is momentum.  I thought, if we could both have good looks on 18.  Unfortunately, I put my drive in the bunker, which made it difficult for both of us to have a look.  I thought we would have a good chance, a realistic chance, if we could both make birdie on 18, obviously, and send it to playoff.
Q. How tough was that line?
ANDREW MEDLEY: It wasn't great.  I was just a little bit up against the lip, and I had an awkward stance.
Q. 18, I think there's about four breaks in that putt, and you had a real good shot of it going in.  Did you think it was in?
ANDREW MEDLEY: No, I knew.  Once it came over the hill and got too far left, I kind of knew it was over.
TAYLOR WOOD: I thought the chip was in.
ANDREW MEDLEY: Caught a lot of hole.  Right when I hit it, I knew it was going to spin a little right, and I thought it was dead center.
Q. What about the whole experience?
ANDREW MEDLEY: It was tremendous.  Taylor was awesome all week.  We had a great partnership for the most part, and just didn't get it done.  It was an all-time experience.  We had a blast.
Q. Obviously, if you guys want to stay together as a team, you can play in Philadelphia next year.  Are you looking forward to that?
TAYLOR WOOD: We've already signed a contract.
ANDREW MEDLEY: Yeah, I'm not playing with anybody else.  I'm looking forward to it.  Looking forward to East Coast golf.  Should be great.
Q. Thanks for your time.
