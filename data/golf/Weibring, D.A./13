Q.
1 under today, two birdie, one par, you were able to keep it together out there in some pretty tough conditions.
D.A. WEIBRING:  Yeah, it was pretty steady.  I made a good par putt at the first hole.  I drove it just in the left rough and kind of had to play under the edge of the tree and put it in the front bunker and got it out and made about a 12 or 14 footer for par.

Then I made maybe a 15 to 18 footer, maybe 20 footer at the second hole for birdie.

And then I came back, I bounced right back and number 3 was playing really tough against the wind today and I made bogey there.

From there on in I'm not sure I really missed any greens.  I drove the ball pretty well and I had some good chances.  But the wind was that much stronger today where some of the crosswinds on tee shots where you really had to offer favor where the past couple day, even Tuesday when we practiced, if you hit the ball solid you could kind of hold it on line a little bit.  Today it was a lot stronger.
Q.  Obviously there's a little bit of enthusiasm before your next round, you're going to take a red number in, no one knows where the final mark is going to be, but you have to feel pretty excited about the way you finished today, going into tomorrow.
D.A. WEIBRING:  I feel like I played pretty well all week.  I had some family on my bag.  Which has been very important.  My cousin, Tim caddied for me the first two days and got affected by the heat a little bit yesterday and my son Matt, who plays the Nationwide Tour, drove up last night late.
Q.  Where did he drive up from?
D.A. WEIBRING:  From home in Dallas.  And so he caddied for me today.  And I don't know who is going to be on the bag tomorrow.  If Tim will bounce back or Matt, but I really enjoyed having Matt out there and Tim all week.  It's been fun.
