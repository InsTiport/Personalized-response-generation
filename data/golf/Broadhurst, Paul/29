  Q.  Very difficult day?   
 PAUL BROADHURST:  I didn't play well.  I started off all right.  Felt good, decent drive off the first, good one on the third.  Yeah, once you get 3-over, you're working so hard to try to keep it going.  I tried and I fought hard, but you know, even at 12, I've got an eagle putt to go back tie the lead I think.  Ran it a couple of foot by and missed it.   
 Putted so bad today it was embarrassing.  A bogey would have kept me still in it.  I never felt in it -- I knew that I was one or two behind, but once I 3-putted 12, missed the short one at 12.   
  
  Q.  Not to make excuses, but can't be easy when Ross is struggling like he was.   
 PAUL BROADHURST:  It certainly wasn't his fault.  You know, he struggled.  He started off with a few 3-putts early on and obviously unnerved him and he struggled.   
 No excuses, really.  Embarrassing, really.
