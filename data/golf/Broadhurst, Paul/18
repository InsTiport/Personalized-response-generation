Q. You must be happy?
PAUL BROADHURST: Till the last.  Fuming a bit about the last, 8-iron in my hand thinking I can make birdie, 2-over -- just leaked it a little bit.  A bit of a frustrating day.  Tough start and it was playing tough.  First four, five holes, were really difficult.  I didn't play them particularly well but again, had a couple sort of 3-putts, as well.  3-putted the second and the third.
Battled a lot but it's so difficult in the squall showers, when the rain came out, it was impossible.  You had no idea why the ball was going.  Battled well and made some good saves.  Just really kicking myself, the finish at the last.
Q. Would you say it's some of the toughest conditions you've played in?
PAUL BROADHURST: Probably.  The wind's not too bad, but when you get the heavy rain, you have just no idea.  You can't hold the club and the ball is coming off.  You have no real control over the ball, so it's pretty grim.
I was pleased, anything close to par is a good score today.  It's a really tough course out there.
Q. I know you're a bit disappointed, but at the end of the day, could be a good start.
PAUL BROADHURST: Plus four, yeah, I'd have took that stood on the fifth tee, I'd have snapped your hand off for 4-over.  But having battled back, I feel should have made four at the last.
Q. A bit of patience now?
PAUL BROADHURST: The forecast is not good tomorrow, I don't think.  I read that it might be worse in the afternoon.  Just have to battle around again and make the most of it.  But these showers coming, anything can happen.
