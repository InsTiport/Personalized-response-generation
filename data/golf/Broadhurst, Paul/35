PAUL BROADHURST:  Not too bad I suppose.  The reason I got to 3 under, I hit one or two good shots, a couple of poor drives.  I bogeyed, what, 14. And then I was unlucky, 16 got back in the water.  Tried to hit it two or three yards past the flag and spun back down and so I made 6.
Q.  Dire situation?
PAUL BROADHURST:  When I was 3 under after five    and then I 3 iron into the par 5 six into the water and made a great par so that was a chance to go 4 under there, really.  You know, I'm not really hitting it well enough to keep it going. When you get into a position to really press on and keep it going, it always seems a bit of a struggle.
Q.  Chip your confidence on that?
PAUL BROADHURST:  I've played well for a month now, so if I'd been playing well    but a bit unlucky on 16 I suppose.
Q.  Is it a case of forcing it?
PAUL BROADHURST:  You normally force it when you're playing well, when you're confident.  I was just trying to let it out really.  A couple of poor drives and miss a fairway, you might bogey.
Q.  Inaudible?
PAUL BROADHURST: Still have a chance.  A couple three 67s, something like that, it's possible.  So I just need to hit it a little bit better.
Q.  Can you fix it quickly?
PAUL BROADHURST:  I'm hitting it pretty well on the range.  Just not as well on the course.  I can't quite figure out why.  Just rhythm is a bit quick on the course.
Q.  You didn't get in last week    inaudible?
PAUL BROADHURST:  I wasn't playing well enough.  I knew in September, get in the majors, so you know, played a couple of majors and one world event.
