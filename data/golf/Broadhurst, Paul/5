 Q.  Currently T10 as we stand currently.  What did it take going this week to get your finish?  
PAUL BROADHURST: I drove the ball all week really, didn't miss too many fairways.  Irons weren't brilliant, neither was the putting.  But I didn't make too many bogeys.  Second and third round was bogey-free.  I think today and the first I had three.  So six bogeys around here is not too bad really.   
But I enjoy this format with the scoring apart, from the top 3.  It's pretty bunched.  And level par, 1-under, 2-under was a good score.  I'm happy with the week.  Left a couple out there today.  But really, tied 10th in a major, you've got to be reasonably happy.   
 Q.  How did the golf course change from Thursday/Friday to Saturday/Sunday?  
PAUL BROADHURST: It got firmer.  The ball was releasing more.  It was playing shorter.  But the main thing for me was the greens got firmer, and I had to start and pitch the ball 10, 15 yards short and the release.  And the pins today were tough.  The USGA didn't want Mr. Stricker shooting the lights out again.  And the pins were tough today.  There were in some wicked, wicked, places.   
So I did well to find them all, to be honest, it just seemed every pin position was like, oh, my God.   
 Q.  What's your schedule look like going forward?  
PAUL BROADHURST: I'm back home in the U.K. for a week, I come back for a week to play THE PLAYERS, and then I'm in the U.K.  for four weeks playing one event, the Senior Open.  So I'm going to have a bit of a break through August, and then I'm playing everything over here for the rest of the season.  I come back and play, back home for a week or so.  And then back for two, back out.  So, yeah, it's a full-on schedule till the first week in November.
