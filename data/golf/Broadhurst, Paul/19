 Q.  Delighted to welcome defending champion Paul Broadhurst to Royal Porthcawl.  How is it going?  
PAUL BROADHURST: Pretty good.  Played the Pro-Am yesterday in glorious weather and come to practise in the poor weather today.  Just taking it easy today.  Been down a couple times to practise.  So I don't need to play two days, really, especially in this weather.  Just practise today and look forward to tomorrow hopefully.   
 Q.  And almost a year to the day since you lifted the Senior Claret Jug.  How has that year been?  Can you put it into words?  
 Lifted:  Hectic.  Yeah, before winning, obviously I was looking like playing 13, 14 events in Europe, but since then, I've played 25 events, most of them in the States.  A lot of travelling backwards and forwards, but that's always been the goal.  Yeah, it's been a good year.   
 Q.  A lot of talk about this course and what happened a few years ago with Bernhard Langer winning by 13.  He's one of your biggest competitors this week, isn't he?  
PAUL BROADHURST: No question, and it's not just Langer.  The field is a really strong field.  The course is a really tough course, especially if you get the weather that may be forecast.  So yeah, it will be interesting.  I wouldn't like to pick a winning score around here at the moment.
