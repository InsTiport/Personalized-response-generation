PAUL BROADHURST:  Went through the back nine without really doing anything.  Made a stupid bogey at 13 with a sand wedge there and knocked it over the green.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
PAUL BROADHURST:  Scores could have been better with the weather, probably will get to 13 , 14 under maybe.  Need a couple 66s.  Pushed it with the driver a little bit and a couple of poor shots.
Q.  Last night    inaudible?
PAUL BROADHURST:  I worked on it.  Keep pointing to the downswing, sometimes just calm down a little bit.  Just got to, you know, I've got to hit a real good 5 iron and it turns a bit left.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
PAUL BROADHURST:  Frustrating five weeks.  It's a bit nearer than it was, so at least I've got, you know, to play    if I can do what I did the first 12 holes, I've got a chance of shooting a low number.
Q.  Will it be more of a gamble tomorrow?
PAUL BROADHURST:  I don't think whether I can to be honest.  I don't see where you can take a gamble on this course.  All the par 5s, you know, sort of like you go in with an iron, so it's not a gamble really, you've got to go for it.

18, you know, there's no holes where you know sometimes you play safe and sometimes you go for it.  Just try and play a little bit better and just make a few more putts, take out the silly mistakes.  Making bogey with a sand wedge and 9 iron when you hit it in the fairway, when you're playing well, you don't do that.  So, we'll keep going.
