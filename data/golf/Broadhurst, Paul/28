   PAUL BROADHURST:  It wasn't a great start.  I played poorly last Sunday.  Birdied the second and hit a really good shot into 3 which is obviously the hardest on the course and holed it from ten feet.   
 You know, it's a bit of an up-and-down day.  A lot of good shots, poor drive at 10th and I made birdie.  Just disappointed that I probably hit the wrong club at the last.  Tried to force a big sand wedge and came up 40 feet short and hit a terrible first putt and ended up making 6.  After the start, to finish with a 6 is disappointing.   
  
  Q.  I imagine if I were to speak to you in two hours' time, there would be even more of a smile and satisfaction with the way things have gone?   
 PAUL BROADHURST:  Yeah, the scoring is not fantastic at the moment.  You know, if the wind drops, then there will be some real low scoring; with the rough it's probably two, three shots easier than last year.  If the wind stays up for the rest of the week, it's a bit of a battle.   
  
  Q.  You talked yesterday about the draw you were trying to battle.   
 PAUL BROADHURST:  Yeah, still there.  I don't know, just can't quite get the move.  Just have to keep working on it until it feels more comfortable and start hit a bit straight.  The left-to-right wind is not a problem, the normal shot is pretty straight.  It the right-to-left wind that I struggle.   
  
  Q.  Certainly a good start, good foundation?   
 PAUL BROADHURST:  Yeah, last Sunday, I played really poor, couldn't feel the move, nothing.  Started like that a bit today.  The tee shot was okay, second shot was really poor.  But I hit quite a lot of fairways and managed to get on the green.
