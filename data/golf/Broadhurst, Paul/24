 Q. 68 and 70, what's been the secret to the low scoring so far? 
 PAUL BROADHURST: I suppose getting it in play. I've got a good caddie on the bag, and just told me to hit rescue when I needed to, hit 3-wood when I needed to and just get it on the fairway. If you get it on the fairway, you've got a chance. That's what I've been trying to do.

 Q. Talking to Graeme Storm yesterday, another former champion, he said every time he arrives here, it inspires him. What about you? 
 PAUL BROADHURST: It can have that effect, yeah. Daunting course, as well, with the finish we've got out there, you can never sort of relax. Every shot you've got to concentrate on. 
 But it's always nice to come back to a course you've done well on. The first name we saw on the board was Stormy and he always seems to do well around here, and obviously I've had my moments around here as well. It's nice to come back here.

 Q. End of last year you were not able to play with a shoulder injury, and started this year with a medical exemption. Where are you now with injury and status on Tour?
 PAUL BROADHURST: Injury is fine and status on the Tour really is non-existent. I'm playing here this week as a past winner. But I'm relying on the Tour to give me invites. I played The Challenge Tour event last week in Aberdeen. I'm playing on invites at the moment. 
 Ideally, a Top-10 this week or better will get me in next week to the Scottish Open. Just take it from week-to-week really.
