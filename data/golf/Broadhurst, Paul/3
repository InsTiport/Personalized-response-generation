 Q.  Your assessment of your play today?  
PAUL BROADHURST: A bit of an up-and-down round.  Started off reasonable.  Got it under par early on and thought, yeah, great start.  Anything under par the first six holes, you've got to be happy, and we did that, and then started throwing them away.  You know, the putter went cold and I lost the pace of the greens, and I was so -- you know, from 30 feet, I was struggling to get it to the hole.  That made it hard work.   
Then that sort of affects the confidence and starting a couple of poor shots, and it was going away from me, really.  I played the last three pretty good and picked up a couple of birdies to sort of rescue the round and keep me up there.   
 Q.  After a long day yesterday, was the conditions easier today then?  
PAUL BROADHURST: I don't know whether it's ever easy.  The wind has actually dropped from this morning.  We went out and it was still breezy.  You know, it's certainly a club, a club-and-a-half wind, but it's beautiful now.  It's flat-calm.  So there's a score out there for the afternoon guys, no question.   
 Q.  Must be nice to finish with a birdie on 18?  
PAUL BROADHURST: Yeah, I didn't hit too many good irons today.  I was flipping it left a little bit, but I made a better swing down 18 and made it easy for myself with a 3-footer on the last.  I'm pleased with the finish.  Got a bit to work on this afternoon.  I was hoping to have the afternoon off, but I need to get on the putting green and just hit a few irons, as well.   
 Q.  I suppose you're satisfied with your position going into the weekend?  
PAUL BROADHURST: Yeah, I mean, you know, three back, so yeah, we're in contention.  You can do no more than going into the weekend, get yourself in contention and hopefully have a good weekend.
