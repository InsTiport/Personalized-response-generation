Q.  Patty, the morning couldn't have gone much worse for you, I guess.  What have you been able to say to the players to try to get them in a positive frame of mind for this afternoon?

PATTY SHEEHAN:  I really didn't have to say much of anything.  Typically we're in this position after the first round.  I don't know what it is, but we don't seem to get out of the blocks very fast.  We always have to play catch-up in the Solheim Cup.  Everybody is ready to go this afternoon.  Nobody is down.  Everybody seems to be in good spirits still.  We just have to play catch-up golf once again.


Q.  How important was it to get at least half a point out of that first session?

PATTY SHEEHAN:  I think it's big.  Last year we got one point.  This year we're just a half point worse than last year.  Like I said, it seems to be like this every year.  We just have to hang in there.


Q.  You've got some good support here on the first tee, haven't you?  I hear they have to go home, the girls tomorrow.  Is that right?

PATTY SHEEHAN:  Yeah.  I'm kind of upset that the Junior Solheim girls have to go home.  They've been great fun to have around, and they're just  -- they give us a little boost every day.


Q.  It's getting a little bit noisy here, Patty.  Thanks for talking to us.

PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's the way it is.  I love it.  Thank you.
