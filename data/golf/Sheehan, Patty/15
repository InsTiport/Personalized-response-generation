PATTY SHEEHAN:  Thank you very much everybody for being here today.  This is indeed a very special day for me and 12 and 13 players that I'm very thrilled to be a part of.  And for another little one there that's going to be a future golfer. 
(Laughter.)
The last 18 months have been an extraordinary experience for me.  When the LPGA named me the Solheim Cup Captain for 2002 I was extremely honored.  And it has been a lot of fun and a great experience to watch the players try to get on the team and try to get their spot for the team. 
It has been kind of a nervous day today, since this is the day that I make my two picks for the team.  I've been nervous for the players and nervous a little bit for myself.  But it's been a quite a journey for these players to go through.  They wanted it so much this week.  And it was such a thrill and I'm so proud of them the way that they played to try to make their spot on the team.  It was really very impressive, an impressive showing. 
And right now I would like to announce the team.  I don't think I need to go into the points, but the number one qualifier on the team is Juli Inkster, Laura Diaz, Rosie Jones, Michelle Redman, Cristie Kerr, Meg Mallon, Beth Danielle, Wendy Ward, Emilee Klein, and Kellie Kuehne. 
Today was kind of a tough day for three players that I had to tell that they were not on the team.  But the two picks, for my last two picks for the team are Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst. 
In addition to the 12 that are on the team, I would like to just say that Dorothy Delasin will be a rookie and she will be a, the traveling alternate for the team.  And she's a quite a young lady.  And she's going to have a bright future.  And this will be a great experience for her to experience the Solheim Cup. 
So with that, I'm very excited for the next two weeks to come.  The players are all getting very excited.  They're all talking to each other.  They're all wondering who they're going to play with.  And that will be my next decision.  And who I'm going to pair them with.  Who is, who is going to have the opportunity to play with whom.  And it's going to be a lot of fun for me and for them. 
The Solheim Cup experience is none other than extraordinary for these players.  They spend two years trying to get on the team and it is unbelievable, the pressure that they will be under for those matches at the Solheim Cup will be more than they have ever experienced before.  And the rookies have no idea how unbelievable this is going to be for them. 
So congratulations to all of those players that have made my team.  And I am so excited and I look so forward to getting to Interlachen and right outside of Minneapolis and we're going to bring the cup home. 
LAURA NEAL:  Any questions here?
Q.  You mentioned there were three girls you did have to tell that I couldn't pick you this year.
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Right.  I had to tell Dorothy that she was not one of the picks, but that she was an alternate.  I had to tell Nancy I had to tell Danielle.  And that is probably one of the most difficult parts of being the captain is to have to sit down or call them on the phone and talk to them and tell them that they weren't on the team.  But it's -- it's part of the process.  We all can't be on the team.  It's an unfortunate thing. 
But the good news is that our next Solheim Cup is only one year away.  And they are well on their way of being on that team.  If they keep playing well.  So I expect to see probably most of those three and then some bright young players on next year's team. 

Q.  Was the final decision based on way the golfers played this weekend?
PATTY SHEEHAN:   No, it wasn't solely based on this week.  I, obviously, Emilee Klein played her way on the team this week.  And I have to give her so much credit.  She's showed a lot of moxie out there.  She hit some clutch shots and she showed me that she wanted to be on the team.  And she didn't want to be left off one more time.  And she has not been picked a couple times.  So I know how hard she wanted to be on the team and she showed a lot of guts.  And I think I forgot the rest of your question.  Sorry. 

Q. Was the final decision based on today's results?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  It wasn't a decision based on this week.  It was a decision based primarily on experience.  We have got some young players on the team, some rookie players on the team.  Cristie Kerr's sitting right behind you.  She is a rookie on the team.  I think that I felt that we needed some leadership.  I felt we needed some experience.  And that's why I went that way. 

Q.  Was the final decision based on today's results?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well, Pat is, has played on two Solheim Cup teams.  She has one of the best winning percentages on the team that has played on Solheim Cup teams.  Her record is 5-2-1.  She was a '86 USGA Junior Amateur champion.  1990 US Amateur champion.  1990 World Amateur champion.  And based on her last seven starts, she was in the top 15 four times and of those, two of those were top-10s.  She has been playing better. 
We all have to keep in mind she just had a baby.  And it's an amazing thing to see someone come back -- there she is -- from having a baby.  And she's worked hard and she's played her way and I think she deserves to be on the team. 

Q.  Did it come down to Danielle and Dorothy?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Yeah, I think -- well, you know, and Danielle was in the mix and certainly Nancy was in the mix throughout the week.  She looked like she was going to win the tournament there for awhile.  And she was going to earn her way on the team.  So I had a lot going on out there the last couple days.  It was extremely exciting for me.  It was unbelievable for the players.  I know they were dying out there trying to make this team.  And I felt for them for each and every one of them.  It was fun to watch.  But it's -- Dorothy, you know, is a great player.  She would have been a good pick too.  So. 

Q.  What was Kelly's reaction when you called her?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Kelly's personality is one of those that is sort of laid back.  And she's like, you know what, whatever happens, happens.  And I had talked to her earlier and she felt confident that she was going to be one of the picks and I just said, you know, you just got to hang in there with me and I'll let you know.  And then when I called her she was very relieved.  But she's pretty laid back.  And she's, she was, you know, taking it as it came and she would have accepted being picked or not being picked. 

Q. What was Kelly's reaction when you called her?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Emilee's play changed things quite a bit, actually.  And it was looking like Pat was going to pass up Kelly Robbins too.  So it was going to look like the two bottom Kelly's were going to get bumped from the team.  So there for awhile I was thinking that I'll have to pick a rookie.  And that would have been an interesting pick.  Because obviously Kelly Kuehne is, she has a lot of experience at Interlachen.  She used to be a member there.  Her husband played up there for many, for Minnesota.  And it was looking like I was going to have to pick those two.  So things changed around quite a bit this week. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Kuehne.  Well, it was looking like that for awhile. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I knew you would have to go into that, wouldn't you. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Hang on a second.  I got 14 pages here. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Kelly Robbins was 11th, and Pat Hurst was 13th.  Hang on a second.  Emilee was nine, Kelly Kuehne was 10.  Kelly Robbins was 11. 

Q. What was Kelly's reaction when you called her?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Klein was in the mix.  Klein is a very solid player.  And like she showed this week, she's got a lot of heart and she was definitely in the mix.  So. 

Q.  You followed her (Klein) her for 9 holes yesterday.  And, she said she didn't know you were there.  Do you believe that?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  She didn't miss a shot in nine holes.  I personally don't believe that.  But, you know, I don't have her eyes, so I can't really say that.  But I thought she looked at me a couple times.  But when you're out there playing you can look around and look at people and not see them. 

Q.  Was that simulated pressure you put on her by following her?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Oh, I don't think so, I really wasn't trying to scare them and I wasn't trying to make them nervous.  I was really just going out to watch them and to look and try to learn their games. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I think basically it sort of ended up to be that way.  But I didn't intentionally go out there to put pressure on them.  I really wanted to go out and learn more about their games and their demeanors and personalities.

Q.  What do you think of your line-up?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I think we have got a great team.  I think its one of the strongest teams that we have ever had. 

Q.  Why?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Why?  Because we have a lot of experience and the younger players that I have, the rookies are all very strong and confident players and every single one of them has a lot of great match play history.  Match play records.  Kelly Kuehne probably has one of the best for a rookie, that -- Cristie Kerr is, she's unbelievable.  Cristie Kerr has done something that not many people can do.  And that is transform herself. 

Q.  Did you know who your picks would be as the day started?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I had no idea how it was going to come out today, last night.  So I didn't know who my picks would be.  But as the day went on it became clearer and clearer because of what Emilee was doing what I had to do. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Yes.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I sure did.

Q.  Before the week started did you know who your picks were going to be?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Yeah.  And I'm not going to say who they are.  I'll get in big trouble. 

Q.  When did you make the calls to the team?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well I talked with her before play was over, but I didn't tell her I was going to pick her.  I waited until after play was over.  And I called Dorothy first and then Kelly and then I talked with Danielle and everyone else.  I actually saw Pat pretty soon after she got done.  She was not too happy with herself. 

Q.  Did you tell her then she was on the team?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Pat?  I did.  I couldn't stand to see her cry. 
(Laughter.) We had to wipe some tears away. 

Q.  What did Kelly Robbins say when you called her?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  When I called her prior to the finish of the tournament, and asked her if she was doing okay, she says, yeah, I'm doing fine, but everybody else around me is not very happy.  They're not doing too well.  So that's just the way Kelly is.  She's laid back and she's like, you know, whatever happens, happens.  And I'll accept whatever you decide. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  She's different. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's right. 

Q.  Can you talk about your emotions leading up to all of this?)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well, I, it was very difficult for me.  I was sad for them, I felt for them.  It's very difficult to have to tell your friends, and they're all my friends, that they're not on the team.  I wish I could pick all of them, but I can't.  And it's difficult.  And it was hard for me.  I was -- there was some trepidation prior to my phone calls and in the middle it was tough.  And I was talking to Danielle, that was tough.  She's been playing so well.  And I understand all of their, their feelings and their hurt and they're sad and they're mad and there's a lot of feelings probably more for them than there is for me.  But it's a tough -- it's not an easy thing to do to have to talk to them about that. 

Q.  Were you by yourself when making the calls?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I was by myself. 

Q.  Did you speak with Emilee?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I saw Emilee, she was just leaving the locker room.  And I told her how proud I was of her play.  Showed so much guts and will and she was extremely happy.  I'm sure that she was --

Q.  Emilee looked a bit nervous today?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  When I watched her play today, very little, but I watched her a little bit, every time I looked at her she had a smile on her face.  She looked very relaxed, very confident.  And I was extremely impressed. 

Q.  Could you tell late in the round who would do what?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well you couldn't tell because 15, 16 and 17, everybody seemed to be dumping their balls in the water.  And it was unbelievable.  And I was like, don't do that any more, guys. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Absolutely. 

Q.  Can you talk about Laura Davies' play today?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Laura has always enjoyed playing here.  And she is a great competitor.  She's always loved the Solheim Cup.  She really is the heart and sole I think of the European team and so she's getting ready.  She's putting her game face on. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I believe it was Friday, yeah. 

Q.  Dorothy had a 10 on the 8th hole on FridayÃ¢ï¿½ ¹did you tell her anything after that?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's correct.  She took a 10 on number 8 and she finished on the 9th hole and she went from 7-under to 2-under.  She was very upset and I told her that her making that 10 on number 8 would have no bearing on my decision of whether or not she made the Solheim Cup team.  So I told her just to, don't worry about it, because it's not even in my thinking.  So.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's correct.  That's okay if you take a 10.  It's match play. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  And she was here, wasn't she? 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  I really wanted to -- yeah, there was some other players out there that wanted to be on my team, like I talked to Mi Hyun Kim about being on the team.  She talked to me. 
(Laughter.) 

Q.  Could there or should there be a President's Cup-type of event?  To bring in the world players?
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well I think that perhaps down the road when there's more interest in that type of an event it could happen.  But I don't think we need to be tinkering with the Solheim Cup format.  I think that it's perfect the way it is.  And we're going to continue to build and the reputation of the Solheim Cup will continue to, will continue on.  And I don't think we need to tinker with that.  But if somebody wants to come up with another event, then more power to them. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's because they play here. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Well they play here.  Right.  Yeah.  Right. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  Yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
PATTY SHEEHAN:  That's why their pocketbook is filled.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thanks for putting up with me this week, guys.
