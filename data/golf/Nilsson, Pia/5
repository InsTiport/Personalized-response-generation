Q.  Give me your thoughts on that shot out of the bunker?

PIA NILSSON:  Definitely.  Liselotte, she is one of the greatest players in the world and I think that's, like, a difficult shot.  She was right there. She is such a competitor and she never gives up. Liselotte is, to me, a marvel.  No matter what happens, she never, ever gives up.  That was just terrific. We've seen some great ball flight here, some great shots.


Q.  Did you see the match before --

PIA NILSSON:  I've followed this one for the last hour.


Q.  Can you give me some comments about Alfredsson?

PIA NILSSON:  That match, I didn't follow as much.  Part of it we played well, but Donna Andrews played unbelievably good and made very many birdies.  I know they had many chances and I know -- I feel -- stroking many of the birdies is fine.  But it's not -- like, just misreading it or just missing the speed the whole time, both today and yesterday.


Q.  Could have been very different, I thought, if Alfredsson had made some of those shots that she just missed?

PIA NILSSON:  Yeah, yeah.  She felt like she was stroking them okay, but it just wasn't there.


Q.  Great match, though.  What did you tell these two ladies, the two Lottas, when they left the green?  What do you say to them?

PIA NILSSON:  Right here?  I just -- I just patted them on the back, Talk to you later.
