 Q.  A lovely 67, how was that?  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: It was great. I basically played flawless golf all around. Hit a good tee shot on 17 and couldn't get up-and-down, but I played solid. Happy with the two days work. My speed was better today than yesterday.   
 Q.  What was the difference today? Was it the putting?  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, just the putting. I hit it pretty close today. I had three putts inside four feet today which always helps. It could have been one or two lower, as well. I missed a couple on 16 coming in on the back nine and also made a couple longer ones as well. Putting was better.   
So just speed on the greens was better today.   
 Q.  Overall, the scores have been a bit lower than yesterday, apart from yourself, obviously. What's the conditions like out there?  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Well, the front nine was actually playing pretty calm, and as soon as we turned on the 10th, the wind started to pick up. The back nine played pretty tough with the wind, and there's quite a few flags tucked away, as well.   
Can't really go for the flags that's tucked away. If you miss it's a guaranteed bogey. Coming in, I just played conservative golf and I hit some great shots on the back nine. Overall, I'm really pleased with the ball-striking today. Hopefully I can carry it on over the next couple days.
