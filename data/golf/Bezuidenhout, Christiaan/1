  Q. How would you assess your round?
 CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT:   I got off to a rough start this morning, made a couple of 3-putts from nowhere this morning.  Bounced back with a nice birdie on 3.
 And then I just kept giving myself chances.  It's the type of course that you can't overpower, it was just keeping it in play, give yourself chances and that's what I did.  My putter's been good over the last couple of days, so hopefully I can keep the momentum going into the weekend.
 Q. If memory serves me correct you played well here last year.  What is it maybe about this course that you enjoy?
 CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT:   Well, it's just my type of course.  It's not a bomber's course, like you can't overpower it over here.  I'm not a long hitter of the ball, but I hit it pretty straight, so, yeah, my course management has been good and I was just trying to keep the soft bogeys off the card and keep hitting greens and give yourself chances.
 Q. How did those couple wins late last year on the European Tour, how did that give you even more confidence than you already had?  Because you had a good year, but those two wins late into the year kind of coming into this year, how did that kind of boost your confidence even more?
 CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT:   Yeah, a lot.  Even though I had those two wins, I didn't feel on top of my game there.  My coach and I have, we made a couple of changes to get more consistency in my swing and in my ball striking and I feel it's starting to creep into my game now.  There's still a lot of work to be done, but, yeah, my thing is just to be a consistent ball-striker and to give myself chances every week.
