Q. 69, and only two bogeys this week. What does that say about how good your game is right now?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, I can drive my ball well the last three days, keeping it in the fairway and giving myself lots of opportunities and stuff.
And as well, limiting the mistakes also helps. I played with Jon at Valderrama, and it was a great atmosphere and all the people came out to support today, and throughout the week have been great. Hopefully I can make more putts than today and keep on driving it well and give myself chances.
