Q. Nice round out there today. You head into the weekend two shots back. Just your thoughts on today's round.
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, I mean, at the start of the golf I started birdieing the first hole. I hit the driver not as well as yesterday (No Microphone.)
Overall, pretty pleased with the round today. It was quite tough out there, especially with the wind, also this morning as well.
Q. Hoping you can give us like three fun facts or something that people might not know about you. Hobbies, interest, anything outside of golf.
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Oh, I like to hang out with my friends. Most of the time we just hang out. I also like deep sea diving. I'm a qualified driver as well, so I enjoy that as well. And then, yeah, I'm just a guy that just likes to play golf and just do my thing.
Q. Hoping can you can walk us through your pre-shot routine on the green. Just saw you leveling it out a little bit there.
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, so that's, I'm reading the green with my feet. It's a technique called AimPoint. So you just try and feel the greens and then measure with the finger. So it's a technique that you have to learn and practice every day. So it helps me to get a better feel of the green and what the slope is like.
Q. You've won on the European Tour before. Not yet on the PGA TOUR. People might not know how to pronounce your name here in the States. Just hoping you can sort of pronounce it for people?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Most of the people don't know how to pronounce it. I've heard some strange pronunciations. But, yeah, it's Bezuidenhout (phonetic.)
Q. What's the strange he's pronunciations you've heard?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: (Laughing.) I can't even do it. I've heard some funny ones, but it is a tough surname, so, yeah.
Q. We talked yesterday kind of about the nerves of playing on this stage. Seems like you're handling it pretty well. How have you remained came out there on the course?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, I mean, I was obviously pretty nervous this morning before I teed off, because I haven't played the course with this wind for the first four days that I've been here. So opposite wind, so I didn't really know what to expect. But, yeah, I just try to go shot by shot, just keep it in the fairway and give myself chances on the greens again. So that's what I'm going to keep on doing over the weekend and see how we finish on Sunday.
