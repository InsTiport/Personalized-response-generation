 Q.  After last week and surviving the brutal conditions to be able to come out here and make some birdies it had to feel like a really, really good start.  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, it's nice to get out there early this morning, the course played really soft in the morning, so you could attack the flags and got off to a great start, so, yeah, it's nice to take advantage of that.   
 Q.  It's an interesting week for rookies because there's a lot of stuff that goes on with it. When it comes to learning this golf course how much do you learn on the golf course and how much do you learn off maybe talking to some people that have played it and the strategy of this place?  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, so I played nine holes Tuesday and nine holes on Wednesday. I played the nine holes that I played I played with Louis and he's a South African and he was here a couple years ago so he knows this course, knows how to play it, where to miss, where not to miss, yeah, so he gave me some great insight into this course and some lines off the tee and stuff like that. So, yeah, it was nice to take advantage of that and post a low one.   
 Q.  You've been playing phenomenal golf this year, no matter the country, the TOUR. What has been most comfortable for you that has carried over to this first round?  
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Just taking sticking to the same stuff every week. My coach and I have been working on the same stuff for probably the last year, year and a half now and just trying to keep it simple. Golf's a difficult game and you don't want to make it more technical and more difficult for yourself. So, yeah, just trying to keep it simple and just stick to your process and what you do. That's about it.
