Q. Great playing. Talk us through your round out there today.
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: I started off, hit it pretty well today. Hit it to 3 feet on 2, and then just was driving it great today, which is really important here in this golf course, especially in the wind. I hit a lot of fairways. I gave myself lots of chances and today was just trying to hit fairways and just give yourself chances.
Q. It seems like the wind's going to pick up this afternoon. You've got to be happy with your score, playing in the morning and getting it over with, right?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yes, definitely. The first six holes this morning it was very nice, a bit windy, not as much as now. But I played well the first few holes, hit it close and made three birdies. And the back nine the wind picked up a bit and I just tried to hit the fairways and keeping it on the greens as well.
Q. How has it been adjusting to this TOUR for you so far?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: It's only my second PGA TOUR start. I was pretty nervous coming in here today. But both my trainer and I did some great work coming in this week and I'm just excited to be here. And obviously, the goal was to play the PGA TOUR, so, yeah, it's a great environment to be part of and this tournament is very special as well.
