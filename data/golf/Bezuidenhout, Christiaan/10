Q. One bogey over 36 holes, how satisfying is that?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: A lot. I was driving it well the last couple of days. Struggled with my driving over the last couple of months and did some quality work with my coach, because I knew you have to come here and drive it well to give yourself chances.
Q. We well-played today, no bogeys. What pleased you most out there today?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Well, just the way I handled myself when things was not going my way, when I was hitting it good, a couple of bad shots, I just kept my composure and just tried to minimise the mistakes out there.
Q. 15, missing the green there, that's not a bad up and in, and the reaction from the crowd afterwards?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: It was great. I had a poor second shot there. It's the last place that you want to miss that green, and with that flag, as well. So to walk away with a birdie there is a bonus, but you need some luck out here to shoot a decent score. Pleased with that.
Q. Since your win, coming into events like this, has that given you a lot more confidence to know that you can compete and win titles out on The European Tour?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Yeah, it does. Every year I try to turn my basics right and try to keep everything as simple as possible. Over the week, if you can give yourself chances from the fairways and stuff, my iron play is pretty good and I've been putting well over the last few months. So I'm just trying to keep give myself chances.
Q. Not sure yet where you're going to stand going into the weekend but you're going to be up there in contention. What's the thoughts going into the weekend?
CHRISTIAAN BEZUIDENHOUT: Well, just to do what I'm doing now. You need to hit a lot of fairways here to make a score. I'm just going to try and do that and see how it goes coming Sunday.
