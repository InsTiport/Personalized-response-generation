  Q. 73 today on a really tough course. Talk about your round, your overall impressions of the round.   
 BRAD LARDON: I played very good today, actually. I went out on the back side and played really good, shot 1-under par, 34 there, and then the front nine I played good there, too. I lost a couple of shots a few yards off, and a few yards off here means bogey a lot of times. I played good. I didn't make any putts today, so if I can do the same thing tomorrow and roll a couple of putts in, I'll be in good shape.  
  
  Q. How did the course play today compared to the practice rounds?  
 BRAD LARDON: It played similar. You know, the practice rounds we probably played more back tees. They moved a couple of tees up, mixed it up a little bit, so in that respect maybe they took a few yards off the length today. But it played very similar. It played good. If you played good and executed you could shoot a good score.  
  
  Q. You've got a chance now with a 73 to go out and possibly make the cut tomorrow. Is that going to be your goal going into tomorrow, or are you just trying to play the best golf you can?  
 BRAD LARDON: I'm trying to do better than make the cut. I mean, that would be nice, but I'm not here to make the cut, I'm here to just add them up and shoot as low as I can, and whatever that is, it is.
