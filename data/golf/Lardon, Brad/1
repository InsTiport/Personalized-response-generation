 Q. Thanks for joining us after today's round. Can you just talk a little bit about your experience this week and what it meant to be out here?
 BRAD LARDON: The experience was great all week. I played terrible the last nine holes, obviously. But through the practice rounds and for 27 holes, everything was pretty unbelievable. It's always great to be coming out with the best players in the world, and for a while competing with them. It was a little disappointing to play like a dog on the back nine, but that's the way it goes sometimes. This course will kick your butt if you fall down, and I fell down and couldn't get back up.

 Q. What can you take away from this week?
 BRAD LARDON: I'll take a lot of experience away, and when my game is on, it's still pretty good. I can take that away. I'm not going to let nine holes ruin 40 years' worth of practice. But good experience being out here. You know, I'm thankful we all have 20 spots and got a chance to get in every year. 
 You know, it's awesome to be out here, spectacular.
