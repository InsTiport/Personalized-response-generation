Q. Just tell me how you played today. 
KARINE ICHER:   Playing good.   Putting was not as good as yesterday.   The green was a little bit slower because obviously we're playing in the afternoon so it's slower than in the morning.
So I missed some makable putts.   Hope to do better tomorrow.

Q.   Still getting a lot of support out there from the locals?
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it's fun to play with all the fans and all the people watching for you and go for you.   So it's a lot of fun, yeah.

Q.   Today Franck and Jacques were talking a lot about this event becoming a major, they're not in it for profit; they trying to grow golf.   Yesterday you were talking about how you hope to inspire young French girls. 
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah.

Q.   What do you think this tournament can go do for golf in France and actually around the world?
KARINE ICHER:   I hope it's going to encourage the young French girl to try golfâ€‘ at least to try.   Maybe if we have 200 girls going to try, two or three going to make it through professional and everything.
That's the goal.   I think we have a beautiful country, good golf courses.   Just the goal is to have more and more young player, like Asia do for young kids playing golf.
