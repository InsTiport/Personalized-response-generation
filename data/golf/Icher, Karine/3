Q. 5-under on the front nine.
KARINE ICHER: Yeah.
Q. What was going so well for you?
KARINE ICHER: I made some good putt; make the difference.  I had good second shots.  On this course, if you start like getting confidence can go like low.  So was a good front nine.
Back nine I make two bogey at the last, at the end, but with the wind picking up, it's a little bit hard.
Q. Yeah.  How is it different this year?  It's a little bit cooler and windier.
KARINE ICHER: It's completely different.  The fairway doesn't roll at all and big rough.
Last year we had much more roll off the fairway and no rough.
And the wind.  The wind and the temperature.  Usually in Phoenix we play in the 90s; today was probably in the 70s, or 60s this morning.  So it's a different course, but we have to adapt.
Q. Did you find it different today even than in your practice rounds?
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, because in the practice round it was warmer, and today, I mean, we have like rain gear all day.
So it was different.  When you lose 10 or 20 degree it make the difference.
Q. Usually it's kind of a birdiefest out here.  We see really low scores every day.  Do you think...
KARINE ICHER: Well, today going to be less, less birdies, because into the wind it's a different course.  Downwind is going to help, but when you have downwind you have into the wind, so...
I think today is going to be a little bit less, but if the wind go down tomorrow and the next days, probably like, yeah, birdies going to show up.
