 Q.   He said you guys decided to kind of not putt downhill.   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, I think the strategy on this golf course is to stay short of the hole.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   
KARINE ICHER:   And try as much as you can to be that uphill putt.  
On 17 I had a downhill putt.   I had a really good shot.   I was kind of dead, but it was difficult.   
So I think it's the key on this course.   Today I had good driving, good putting.   My coach help me a lot yesterday because he came and help me on the range, on the putting green.  
Things are going great, so...  
   
 Q.   Staying steady?   I mean, a lot of players seem to a problem, either one bad hole or tee shots or...  
KARINE ICHER:   It's a tough golf course, especially with the wind and temperature.   Gets so cold.   You try to get to stay warm and try to catch the right wind and you go with it and make some putts.  
   
 Q.   You have to feel good about the first day.  
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it's a good score.   Hope to be on the same feeling tomorrow.   Probably going to have rain, so we will see.   
   
 Q.   Is your little girl here.   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, she's here.  
   
 Q.   So go pick her up and have dinner?  
KARINE ICHER:   Now we have to pick her up, give her a bath, feed her, and go back to bed, so...  
   
 Q.   We both have almost three year olds, so we understand.  
KARINE ICHER:   You know.  
   
 Q.   What else?  
KARINE ICHER:   No, it was just a good day.   Happy about that.   I stayed confident all through the round.   
   
 Q.   Did you hit every green in regulation?  
KARINE ICHER:   I missed one parâ€‘3, No. 3.   Yes, No. 3.   
   
 Q.   Amazing consistency.   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, no, it was a good day.   Sometimes you have good days, so you take it.
