Q. Tougher round today.  How would you describe it?
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, tough pin positions, tough course.  Greens are quicker for sure because of the heat.  Otherwise, I missed some shots more on the right, so I had more up-and-down to do.  And I had one 3-putt -- well, two, and then No. 10.  So that doesn't help.
I take what it is and hopefully it's going to be better tomorrow.
Q. You're probably going to be three or four shots going into tomorrow.  Does the game plan change?
KARINE ICHER: No.  Just try to sink some more putts and that's it.
Q. What do you do tonight to get ready?
KARINE ICHER: Tonight, just eat, have a shower, taking care of my daughter and that's it and just sleep.  I think we are going to play late until tomorrow, so we are going to have a little rest in the morning.
Q. Your daughter travels with you on Tour?
KARINE ICHER: Yeah.
Q. How old is she?
KARINE ICHER: She's four.
Q. How much has the course changed the last couple days, or has it?
KARINE ICHER: The course has changed.  And on top of that, it changed a few tee box and you have to adjust and think a bit more.  Off the fairway we have a lot of runs, so you have to be careful of the rough, the bunkers.  Some bunkers get in play, some not.  And the pins are really in the corner of the greens, so they really want the best player to win.  Obviously it's going to be the case.
