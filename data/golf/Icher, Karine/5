Q. Tell me about your start there.  First two holes you birdied.
KARINE ICHER: Obviously when you start birdie, birdie gives you a little bit more confidence.  No, the course is in magnificent condition.  Really, really good green, probably the best green here that we ever seen since -- last year was nice, but this year is too.
So it's even like easier to putt because when you're ball is on the line you keep the line.  No, but my game was fine.  I just change my driver yesterday because I found like I was like too short.  I said, Well, try.  I have nothing to lose.
I took another one and seem working, so...
Q. (No microphone.)
KARINE ICHER: I had good putting, good like four or five-footer.  I was strong on that part.
And then good driving.  I pick some yards, few yards off the tee, so instead to hit a 5 I hit a 7, so that makes a difference.
After five weeks on the road in Asia, my coach was here, so we worked a little bit yesterday on technique.  So it helps, too, because when you're away you send video, but it's not the same.  When you have your coach here to give you more confidence and give you the good words, makes a difference.
Q. How important do you think it is for you to get off to a good start in a tournament like this with all the big guns playing and so much at stake.
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, it's always better to start nice rather than like over par.  So I take it.  Tomorrow it's another day.  I'll keep going.  A golf tournament is four days, so keep adding.
Q. How beneficial do you think it was to play today under the cloud cover?
KARINE ICHER: Well, this morning it was pretty cold.  Now it's better, but I think the wind still the same.  Even between this morning and the afternoon.
But this morning it was chilly.  I don't think it was an advantage to play in the morning or afternoon.  It's same for everybody.
