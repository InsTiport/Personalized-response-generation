Q. So hard the whole way.  Describe how you're feeling now.
KARINE ICHER: It was a tough match.  I mean, we didn't play super good.  But we did both some good shots, good holes.  I made some putts.  So, yeah, we halved the match.  I mean, it's half a point for Europe.  It's better than nothing.  But, yeah, it was tough.
Q. Describe how you're feeling right now, with the current situation, the leaderboard, how it is.
KARINE ICHER: Well, I mean, it was a challenge today.  Everybody knew that.  I think everybody tried their best.  But they're all good players.
I mean, on the paper we were not the favorite.  If you take all the Rolex Rankings numbers, we're far away.  So, I think we did a good fight.  And I hope the girls are going to try their match and as much as they can and pick up some experience for the future.  I mean, it's still a match.  It's still the Solheim Cup.  It's not done.  And keep going.
