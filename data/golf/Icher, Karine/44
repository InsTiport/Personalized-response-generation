   MODERATOR: Karine Icher, you are the highest-ranked French player if the field this week. How does it feel to come back and play the Evian Masters on your home soil?   
 KARINE ICHER: Good. It's the best year of the year for me. Pride to be here. Beautiful course. Everything is perfect. Hope to get a good week and go for it.  
 MODERATOR: You've had a pretty steady year so far in 2010 on the LPGA Tour. How did you feel your preparation has been for the week?   
 KARINE ICHER: Yes, this year was very -- I had good results, but I've made only two cuts. So gave me confidence obviously, and then just prepared like the other tournaments. Usually practice with my coach in Orlando and do some physical training. That's it. Nothing special.   
 I don't want to train different because it's the Evian Masters. It's a tournament, like hard tournament in the LPGA, and we'll see. Obviously it's more difficult because it's here in my country and a lot of people wait for me and look for me. So I'm gonna try to have fun first of all.
