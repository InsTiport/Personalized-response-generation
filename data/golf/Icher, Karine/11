Q. 4-under round, perhaps not the finish you were exactly looking for, but how do you feel?
KARINE ICHER: Well, it's still a good score, so when you play under par here, you have to smile and get happy.  It was a long day today, so wake up at 4:30.  I'm looking for rest and maybe try to do better tomorrow.
Q. How much of a grind was the day?
KARINE ICHER: It was hard.  I mean, we had wind coming up this afternoon, and this morning it was cold.  We had different conditions, and we had to adapt as much as we can do on the golf course, and that's not easy.  It was not an easy day.
Q. 8-under par, though, going into the final round; what do you expect for tomorrow, and how do you feel?
KARINE ICHER: I expect a good score.  I expect to make more putts than everybody else, and we'll see.  I mean, there's the best player in the world here, and they're all playing really well, so I'm sure somebody is going to shoot like 6- or 7-under, so just be prepared.
