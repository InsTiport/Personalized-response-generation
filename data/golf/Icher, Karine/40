  THE MODERATOR:   Now we have Karine Icher in the interview room.   Good round.   Can you just take me through what you did well. 
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, was a good round.   I love this course because we have a lot of opportunities to make some birdies, so it's fun to play.   Good greens, good setup. 
I had a really good putting, so that helps to make birdies.   Hope to do the same tomorrow. 
THE MODERATOR:   We had a week off between Evian and now.   I know you went home. 
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it was nice.   I spent a week home.   We saw the family, the friends.   It's important because it's only one time per year. 
We flew in on Monday.   So we are a little bit on jetlag.   But otherwise it was fun to see everybody and spend time in my country. 
THE MODERATOR:   Your husband is on the bag for you, and your daughter is at daycare.   How is it traveling as a big family? 
KARINE ICHER:   It's super nice.   We have to be really well‑organized.   But it's fun to be parents.   First we are parents, then player and caddie. 
So far she traveling good.   Now she sleeps finally after a year, so makes it easier.   Before, when we was traveling, she didn't sleep well.   So now she sleeps well and it makes easier for us. 
It's cool to have her on the Tour and traveling with her. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Can you talk about your finish today, the last three holes.   Going into that you were 2‑under, then you made a late charge to get up to the top of the leaderboard. 
KARINE ICHER:   I made birdie on No. 8.   I was starting on 10, so 8 was my 17.   On my front nine, I made three birdie in a row, gave me like some confidence for the rest of the course. 
Right now we had a little bit of rain so the green was a little bit bumpy at the end.   Maybe I had more opportunity to make birdie.   Tomorrow I'm playing early, so hopefully we're going to have better greens and more chance. 

Q.   You never won a tournament.   Is this the week?   Are you feeling it? 
KARINE ICHER:   Maybe yeah, why not (laughter). 
My game is good.   I have to keep my putting that way.   We'll see on Sunday.   But there's so many good players, you always see like 62 or 63 on Sunday winning the tournament.   Hope it's going to be me. 
But I know there's going to be a lot of good players who going to shoot really low score.   So we'll see on Saturday and Sunday. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you. 
KARINE ICHER:   Thank you.
