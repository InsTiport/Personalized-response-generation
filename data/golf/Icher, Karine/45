 Q. How did the round go? 
 KARINE ICHER: I'm happy about this round. 

 Q. Anything stick out as far as a good hole, a bad hole, anything that was particularly interesting?
 KARINE ICHER: It's an interesting golf course because there is many holes you can make birdie. It's tougher because of the pin position. 
 So you really have to think about strategy, and that's what I did today. 

 Q. The 5 par, the 3 pars, the 4 pars, any of them particularly hard or easy or difficult?
 KARINE ICHER: No, there's no easy or difficult. I think to play a good round, you have to think about every single shot and stay in the present. 
 So that's what I -- it forced me to do today.

 Q. You're at minus six; the leader is the at minus seven. How does that look for the rest of the tournament?
 KARINE ICHER: Well, there are three more rounds. With experience I know it's not finished. 
 Today was a good round. I hope tomorrow gonna be the same, but it's gonna be another day. Definitely I -- it's too early to predict something for the end of the tournament. 
 So I'm gonna try to stay focused and stay with the good putting, and we'll see.

 Q. Again, in general your general reaction to the day's round was?
 KARINE ICHER: Yeah, good. Good group. Good spirit. Yes, good day today.

 Q. And you're in good shape and spirits, good physical shape?
 KARINE ICHER: Yeah, yeah, sure. 

 Q. Well, best of luck to you. 
 KARINE ICHER: Thank you.
