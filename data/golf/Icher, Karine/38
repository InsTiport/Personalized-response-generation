 Q.   Assess your round and the conditions you had to play under today.   
KARINE ICHER:   It was a little different today because we played different tees than in the practice rounds, so it was like a new golf course.   Good conditions, the greens are a little bit slower than in the practice rounds.   So I felt it plays easier than it should be, but it is still a difficult course.   
I had good putting today, bad driving, but you don't drive on a lot of holes.   It turned my way a little bit better, but I have to work on my driving to be ready for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   This weekend, will it come down to putting?   It seems like that is pretty much what everyone's saying here?   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it's all about putting and chipping.   You can do like all parâ€‘3s, and it will be the same, to start from the middle of the fairway.   Because the first shot is not the big deal.   It's open and wide, and it's more from the second shot to the green.   We can have crazy pin positions.   And I think by the weekend it's going to be that case.  
   
 Q.   Knowing that, how important was this round for you today?   Because you know those pins are not going to be where they are?  
KARINE ICHER:   Yes, on the weekend it's going to be two or three from the side.   It's important to play under par and take a little bit of shots ahead to be able to be more relaxed by the weekend.  
   
 Q.   As you look at the scores, there are not many people under par right now?   
KARINE ICHER:   No, but we'll see.   Maybe this afternoon there are going to be more.
