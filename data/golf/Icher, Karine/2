 Q.  Karine, 3-under day and you're right at the top of the leaderboard after day two.  Heading into the weekend, how are you feeling now with two rounds under your belt?  
KARINE ICHER: Feel great.  It's better to be here rather than at the end.  No, I play decent today.  Made good putts.  Hope my game gonna stay with me up until Sunday, and we'll see.   
There are many, many good players here and many hole where you can make birdie.  So it's fun to play.  It's a nice course.  Keep it up.   
 Q.  Tell us about the putter this week.  Yesterday we talked about.  Tons of birdies yesterday and just one bogey today.  I would imagine the putter has been your friend this week.  
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, so far so good.  And actually?  I change my putter.  Went back with the Two Ball Odyssey, and it's much better.   
Yes, you always want to put more putts.  But that's golf.  You can't make everything.  The key here is to stay patient and enjoy the game.   
 Q.  Tell us about the special guest you have here following you, former LPGA winner.  
KARINE ICHER: Yes, Anne Marie Palli.  She won twice on tour few years ago.  It's nice to having her like following us, not only me, but the other French player.  It's a support.  She always has a joke and she always smile.   
It's a refreshing to having her.  Thanks for that.   
 Q.  Give me a thought on the weekend.  
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, we'll see.  You know, two more days.  We just are at the half of the tournament, so many thing can happen.   
Hope the God of golf going to be with me.  I wish luck to everybody.
