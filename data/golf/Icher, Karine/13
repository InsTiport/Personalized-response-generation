 Q.  Seems like a lot of people are shooting low today.  How do you think it's playing differently?  
KARINE ICHER: It's a course like where you can have a lot of opportunities, so it's fun to play.  There's par-5 reachable and short irons in the second shot.  So obviously people are going to shoot low.  The weather is perfect, less wind than yesterday, sunny, so good greens, so it's perfect condition.   
 Q.  What was working for you today?  
KARINE ICHER: I did good putts, so my putting was good.  So I'm quite happy with that.  And my second shots were pretty accurate, so it was easy to make putts on the birdies.   
 Q.  Gave yourself a lot of close chances?  
KARINE ICHER: Yeah.  So that's what you're looking for on this course, like to be close on the hole on the right side, uphill, to get a chance to make a birdie.  And we have few chances to make eagle, so it's fun to play when we can have par-5 reachable, it's not all the time.  And also on No. 13 they moved the tees, so that give us like more fun and variety.   
 Q.  Do you think the crowds seem to be just huge?  How fun is it to play in front of this crowd?  
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, it's nice, and especially for the crowd, they want to see birdies.  So to set up the course a little bit easier, it's good.  It's not that easy because the pin is still in the good position, but move the tee a little bit, they see good golf games.   
 Q.  Do you expect maybe they'll try to mix it up tomorrow and make it a little tougher on you guys?  
KARINE ICHER: I don't know.  I think the forecast is perfect, so if the forecast is good, I mean the rough is not going to grow.  We know the greens, we played here last year, so we had tough position like the first three rounds.  I don't think they can put the course tougher.  I don't think so.
