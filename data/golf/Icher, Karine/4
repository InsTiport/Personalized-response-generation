(Recording in process.)
KARINE ICHER: I had good putts, so pretty happy about it.
Q. Tomorrow could be interesting.
KARINE ICHER: It's golf, so, yeah, it can be interesting, like you say.  It's another round of golf, the last one of the year, so let's enjoy it.
Q. There are so many people up there at the top close together.  Do you feel extra pressure to step up?
KARINE ICHER: No.  I been in this position so many times and I never won, so I just try to play my game, play my shots, and try to do the best that I can on every shot and try to make some putts.  That's it.
Q. Do you feel like this was a week you might play really well and be in contention?
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, yeah.  I can say that, yeah.  It's also the last tournament of a big swing.  Like we did the Asian swing and then the last one, so it's just like the routine to come in the morning and play 18 holes and go home and again and again and again.
Q. Do you scoreboard watch?
KARINE ICHER: No, not a lot.
Q. Okay.  Play well tomorrow.
KARINE ICHER: Thank you.
