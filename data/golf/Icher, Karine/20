Q. That was a tight match today.  What do you think will swing it your way tomorrow morning?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Make some birdies.  Just holing putts, a couple of chances.  We were due one.  We both missed some, so it's nice to finish there with a birdie and to go 1-up.
Q. Seems you're chopping at the door all the time and just can't get those putts to drop.  That's the key, just to get some putts to drop tomorrow morning?
KARINE ICHER: Yeah, because of the pin.
Q. Going for dinner tonight?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, dinner and sleep.
KARINE ICHER: Dinner, sleep, shower.
