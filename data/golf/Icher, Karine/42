Q.   Played well today.   Take me through your round and how you played. 
KARINE ICHER:   Played well.   Very good driving.   Very happy with my tee shots today.   Good putting.   Just disappointing about the end of the course, 15, 16.   15 I miss like six‑foot putt for birdie; 16 I missed my shot on the right side so I was dead.
So maybe two shot here otherwise would be minus‑4 so it would be great.   But anyway, to be under the par here it's good.   Happy to be in France.   Happy to play in front of my friends and fans and family, so that's cool.

Q.   Obviously the reception you get from all the media, they don't care about anybody else now that you're playing well.   They want to talk to you.   How good does that feel?
KARINE ICHER:   It's amazing, because usually when I play in the U.S., I am not American, so I have interviews when I'm playing well.   Here in France I have obviously some work to do, so that's nice, too.
It's important to talk to the media.   Obviously I hope to have more young French girls come to the golf after watching Evian on TV, maybe trying to play golf. 
To be a major next year going to help for sure.
We have the Ryder Cup in 2018, so everything gonna to help golf in France, which is good, because it's a small country, not a lot golfer.   So that's good.

Q.   Last one:   How nice is it to come home with your baby daughter and have your whole family here?
KARINE ICHER:   Well, the first time she was in France, so amazing.   Yeah, she's almost one and first time she's in France.   So I'm glad she was able to see all the family and friends.   It was cool.
Grandma and grandpa taking care of her so we have a little rest, because she had a hard time to sleep when we're traveling.   It's good.   It's okay.
