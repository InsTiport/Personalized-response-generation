 Q.   What an unbelievable display of putting, golf, you guys were fantastic.   Aza, Karine, how do you feel about this moment right now?   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   It feels amazing.   It's always nerve wracking to get on the first tee.   But we played well from the beginning and we had an amazing stretch on 8, 9 and 10 making bombs.   So that was huge for us.   
And then after that we just kept plugging along and we just did our job.   
   
 Q.   Karine?   
KARINE ICHER:   They're really good players.   We played against the number, what?   They're in the topâ€‘10 in the world.   So it was great to win this match and I think that I found a friend forever.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Karine played amazing.   So I couldn't miss that one.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel this was a great partnership?   It sure looked as though you were having a lot of fun out there.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   We did really well.   My boyfriend and her husband get along really well.   So it was fun to be out there.   And we trust each other and can talk about anything out on the course.   So it was really nice.   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it was a good team, a good pairing.   
AZAHARA MUNOZ:   Thanks, Lotta.   
(Laughter.)  
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, thanks, Lotta.
