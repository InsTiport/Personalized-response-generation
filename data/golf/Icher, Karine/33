 Q.   Tell me how was your day?   You re heading into the weekend at the top of the leaderboard.   
KARINE ICHER:   Good day, good putting made the difference today.   The course is quite hard, tricky fairways, big roughs, so looking forward to getting some good drives on the weekend and still good putts.  
   
 Q.   How much did last week‑‑ I mean, you played a crucial role.   The first time you're playing Solheim in a number of years.   What did that do confidence‑wise or carry into this week?   
KARINE ICHER:   A lot of confidence, I mean, when you can perform with this kind of pressure and this kind of tournament, then everything seems easier.   So, I think we're all very tired, but good memories and a good energy from last week.  
   
 Q.   There are a lot of you up on the board.   Cristie is hanging around, Suzann's there.   It seems like you guys took the momentum?  
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, just keep going.   Just keep going to make some putts and that makes a difference.  
   
 Q.   You played well yesterday as well.   What is the difference today in your round?   
KARINE ICHER:   I made more putts today.   I made another two bogeys and yesterday one bogey.   But the course is hard.   I mean, the fairways are tricky, and the small greens sometimes are very fast.   So you really have to think where you have to put the ball on the green and it worked pretty well today.  
   
 Q.   Inbee Park minus‑9 last I saw.   When she's got it going like this, is that a tough order?   
KARINE ICHER:   It's very hard to stop, but we'll see.   You know, in golf, we never know.   We'll see by the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Karine, you're one of the moms on Tour and you've been playing so consistent ever since having Lola, do you think being a mom has helped your game overall?   
KARINE ICHER:   Maybe, maybe.   Maybe I'm more relaxed on my golf game.   When we go back home, it's no more golf and it's just about her and spending time with her and playing and laughing, so maybe it helps.   It's a lot of organization and we don't sleep a lot.   But, yeah, it's kind of helped.  
   
 Q.   I was going to say, you and Fred seem to do is so smoothly.   It just seems seamless for you guys, like Lola's there and it's part of it.   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it seems.   Not in the room with us, but it seems, yes.  
   
 Q.   Did last week help in terms of dealing with nerves if it comes down to Saturday and Sunday afternoon and you're in the final group or so?   Nothing I would imagine would be more stressful than what you guys went through last week?   
KARINE ICHER:   Exactly.   When you can go through last week everything, it's easier to do.   So I just play good golf and good golf shots and that's it.  
   
 Q.   You have momentum, obviously, but a lot of the girls have said they're tired.   They're jet lagged.   Has it sort of caught up to you yet?   Are you sort of playing through it?   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, jet lag, we are in the same time zone as Denver, but just being tired from last week.   I mean, last week we had Saturday to do or Friday 36 holes to do, and a lot of pressure and wanting to do well.   It was a hard course too, and we spent a lot of time doing interviews and media and ceremonies and to do make‑up and hair and everything, which is good, but it keeps you off your general routine.  
   
 Q.   Stacy withdrew, Michelle's sick, like it's catching up to some of them.   
KARINE ICHER:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   I think it's normal.   We're just human.
