  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Karine Icher into the interview room.   Take me through your round today.  
KARINE ICHER:   A little trouble at the beginning, made stupid mistakes.   But the course is a little bit tougher today.   
Then I had couple birdies, so give me more confidence to finish the round.   I had a birdie on 17 and another one on 13.   So that's good.   
THE MODERATOR:   I know it was drizzling in the beginning of your round.   Was that a bit of a hassle?   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, it's always better to play with the sunshine.   The rain was like a little bit not a lot but enough to be wet.   The green was wet also, so...   
Hope it's going to be better this weekend.   
THE MODERATOR:   It's still a little bit early, but a win this weekend would be your first win on the LPGA Tour.   What are your thoughts heading into the weekend?   
KARINE ICHER:   We'll see.   I've been many time in that position in my career and never won.   I take just easy and try to play my best golf as I can and we'll see.   
THE MODERATOR:   Experience has to help you though, right?   
KARINE ICHER:   Yeah, after seven years on Tour I should learn quickly, but we'll see.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   In what specific way was it tougher for you out there today?   
KARINE ICHER:   The wind was a little bit different than yesterday, stronger.   Pin position was not very easy.   
The course was a little bit longer because last night we had a lot of rain, so much more roll on the fairways.   It make the course more difficult.   
For me was a little bit more difficult at the beginning.   So that's it.   
   
 Q.   We're going to be seeing golf as an Olympic sport in four years.   What does that mean for you personally to see that as a medal game now, and for the sport of golf in general?  
KARINE ICHER:   I hope it's going to inspire a lot of young girls around the world.   Finally we are in the Olympics.   We should be in the Olympics from a long, long time.   
So will be nice for me to represent France in the Olympics.   We are not a lot of French player, so maybe I have a good chance.   But we'll see in four years.   A lot of things can happen between now and the Olympics.   
But definitely it's very, very good for golf, especially for women's golf.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
KARINE ICHER:   Thank you.
