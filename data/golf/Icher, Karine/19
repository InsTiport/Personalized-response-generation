 Q.  Great one today.  How does it feel?  
KARINE ICHER: Wonderful.  Nice time with her, I hope not the last time.   
CATRIONA MATTHEW: We played well together.  Great start yesterday.  We hung in and just kind of made a couple of birdies coming in.   
 Q.  You think the putt on 15 gave you momentum going into this morning?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, we missed one on 11, 13 and 14, both of us, so we were due one.   
 Q.  How does it feel to put a point on the board for Europe this morning?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Great.  As big a lead as we can get going into singles.   
 Q.  Going into this afternoon confident?  
KARINE ICHER: Yeah.
