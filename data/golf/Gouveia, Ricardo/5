RICARDO GOUVEIA: It's a good score.  It was really tough today.  I was 1-over on the front nine and then came back really strong on the second nine, it was playing really tough.   
 Q.  Are you proud of yourself for what we call bounceback-ability?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, especially in these tough conditions, it was good to hole a few putts on the back nine and be in the mix for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How different was the wind today compared to other days?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: It was just much stronger, coming from the same direction, but just much stronger than the last few days, and it was much cooler today, as well.   
 Q.  Are you excited to give yourself an opportunity?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, of course.  It's always good when you have a chance to chase that title on a Sunday, that's what we practice for.
