Q. Fantastic final day for you, a 65.  That's your lowest score on this golf course.
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, I'm afraid so.  It was an amazing day for me.  In front of home crowds, as well.  On the last day, on a Sunday, it was really, really nice.
Q. One eagle on the card this week.  Nice to get it today on the 12th.  You had a pretty good run of birdies just before, as well.
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, I played -- the front nine, I played a lot better today.  I knew I had good chances, good opportunities on the back nine. I just stayed patient.  I rolled a good putt on 11, a good putt on 12, and all of the sudden, I started believing that I could get close to the leaders.
I think I had another birdie somewhere, on 14, and unfortunately couldn't make it on 17.
Overall, I'm really happy with the week.
Q. We spoke to you earlier in the week about playing in your home tournament, and the crowds have been fantastic.  I think reaction on the 18th when the putt went in really said it all.
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, they were amazing all week.  I can't thank them enough.  I really felt the support, the vibe, the good vibe behind the crowd.  At certain points this week, I needed it, and I can't thank them enough.
