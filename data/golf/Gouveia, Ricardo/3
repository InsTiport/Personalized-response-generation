Q. How was that for you?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Very good round.  I didn't start very well with a couple of tee shots I missed but then I got it going on the back nine and it was good to make a few birdies coming in.
Q. No bogeys today.  What was the key to your consistency out there?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: I think I hit pretty much all the greens, a lot of greens in regulation.  I didn't make huge mistakes which was key for today's round.
Q. And how was the course playing?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: It's not very difficult.  The rough is down.  It was a bit trickier in the afternoon with the wind but it didn't blow very hard.  So it's very scorable.
Q. Do you get much support out there from friends and family?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, yeah, lots of family, friends, giving me -- cheering me up, which is great.
Q. Do you like the pressure of a home tournament?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, it's good.  It's good to have this kind of event where you have family and friends and people supporting you, behind you.  Obviously there's a bit more pressure but it's good to learn for the future.
Q. Looking forward to the rest of the week?
RICARDO GOUVEIA: I don't want to rest.  I want to keep it going because there's a lot of birdie chances out there.  The guys are going to go low.  I'm going to stick to my game plan and take advantage of the birdie chances and hopefully I can have a chance at the end of the week.
