 Q.  Thoughts on what seems a very successful week?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, it was a great week.  I didn't start very well but I knew my game was good.  I just stayed patient.  Tough course, and yeah, it played out in the end.  Very satisfied to shoot a 5-under round on the last day.   
 Q.  What you say about your game being good, we've seen that in recent weeks.  It's been building nicely, hasn't it.  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, I was struggling kind of middle of the season and then needed to do some changes on the swing, and it's paying back now.   
 Q.  Is that just a matter of time and application?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, it is.  Like I said, it's staying patient, grinding it out every week, and waiting for your weeks to come, and that's what I did.   
 Q.  The bigger picture is good, as well, isn't it, because not only is there huge prize money, ranking points, but you're in next week?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: Yeah, it's massive for me to make it to Dubai.  Going into the last regular-season event in Portugal, I had to play well to get into Turkey and then I had to play well in Turkey to get in this week, and again, I had to play well this week to get in Dubai.   
So I'm just really happy.   
 Q.  And it is marvelous in terms of prize money and rankings, isn't it?  
RICARDO GOUVEIA: It is, yeah, yeah.  It's big, massive events with shorter fields, and a lot of good players.  So it's very, very nice.
