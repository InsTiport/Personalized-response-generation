  CAMERON TRINGALE:   Just where I'm at ball striking‑wise, and the putting is a lot better today than it was yesterday.   So seeing improvements there.   Feels good.  
   
 Q.   How tough is this course?   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   It's a bear.   The rough is quite penal.   Depending on‑‑ you know, you can get a lie and not be able to hit it 150 yards.   
But it's really tough.   The greens are quite undulating.   So you have the tough hole‑‑ long par 4s on the back side there and tough greens to boot.   So it's all you want.  
   
 Q.   You still have to get‑‑ there's still afternoon play, but do you feel pretty good with where you're at right now?   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah.   I mean, 4 under through two days out here is some good golf.   Looking forward to the next two.  
   
 Q.   How does the course compare, say, to yesterday?   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I'd say just the greens were rolling a little better in the morning.   With less guys going through, I felt like it was easier to make putts just in the morning.   
I got off to a nice start in the front, and then it was just coasting.   But there's really no wind, which is nice.   It helps.   It helps control the ball.  
   
 Q.   The only other player who used the word penal to describe the course was Castro.     Were you guys teammates at one point?   What's your relationship with him?     
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, we played two years together.   He was a junior my freshman year at Georgia Tech.   He's a good friend.   Learned a lot from him.   He's one of the brightest people I've ever met.   He was a good teammate to have and glad to see him playing well.  
   
 Q.   Other than now, when he's leading.   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, we've been competing for a long time.   Hopefully, we'll have a chance to the battle it out on Sunday.
