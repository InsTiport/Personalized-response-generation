 Q.   I understand bogey-free, 4-under par on a windy day?   Got to be happy with that round of golf.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, absolutely.   It was playing tough out there, lot of the long holes were playing into the wind with the north wind today and it really was tough.   I was glad to just reach some of those holes and to get out bogey-free was a great success.  
   
 Q.   You're kind of treading water as you make the turn.   Teed off back at the 10th.   Then you get on fire at 3, 4, 5.   Three really nice birdies in a row for you?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, we had the right wind on 3 and 4 and then had the nice chip-in for birdie on 5, I guess, and had good momentum.   Hit a lot of great shots coming down the end.   Had a good chance there on 8 and 9 and, yeah, it was a really solid day.   No complaints.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned the chipping.   You didn't have many putts the entire day, 24 putts.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I was on the fringe a lot.   A lot of those holes come up a little bit short on the front fringe.   I putted nicely to get those near the hole and be able to clean them up.   It's good.  
   
 Q.   I imagine everyone is thinking about 18 into the wind.   What will the players face as they come through that hole in the afternoon?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I don't know about the afternoon.   Depends what the wind does.   I hit a good drive and a 3-wood and didn't get there.   So, it was playing long, but, you know, thankfully the short game kicked in and saved me.  
   
 Q.   One bogey the entire week thus far.   Well played.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Thank you.   Appreciate it.
