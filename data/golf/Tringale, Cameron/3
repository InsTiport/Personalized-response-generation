 Q.  Nice back nine for you, four straight birdies.  What worked well?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Made a couple of putts.  Just been hitting it well all week and finally I made like a five-footer for birdie on 13.  And that just kind of -- I hit the green in two and it was a momentum-saving putt, was able to birdie the next two.  So my striking has been good and I got a few of those putts to go in.   
 Q.  Long couple of days with this weather.  How do you adjust to something like that?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I got lucky I didn't have to play any holes this morning.  So I was one of the fortunate side.  And just kind of going with the flow, being easy, whatever tee time, sometime around 1:00.  So just not freak out.   
 Q.  Did you do anything in the morning?  Just relax?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Not really.  Just hung out.   
 Q.  You've been in the hunt the last few starts, was there anything that clicked for you in these last four tournaments?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I think it's been like a snowball, just getting a little more confident, a little more fire, like not playing well, the last round of John Deere, kind of feel like, all right, let's get back in that position.  And fortunately I'm getting close.   
 Q.  You're in the hunt for tomorrow, what's your mindset?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Just keep getting it.  Storm the castle.  I think it's easy to like play safe but in this format anything can happen.  Just try and put up as many points as I can.
