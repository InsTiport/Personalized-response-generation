 Q.   Seven birdies with a par on 18.   Talk about this day.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I think the 7 birdies, we want to focus on the good stuff there.   It was a nice thing and I feel good, quick start and I played steady all day.   Probably could have had a few more, obviously, on the backside.   Overall, very nice day.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the start today because even par coming in, what was so different about the course today and for you?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Well, there was no wind this morning and it was a little softer so you could be a little more aggressive to the pins and I hit a good drive and good second to a couple feet on the first hole and felt good momentum.  
   
 Q.   I thought your iron play was very strong.   You're inside 12 feet on a lot of these putts and some inside 5.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I made all the close ones for birdie I had for the most part.   I didn't make anything long.   It wasn't a crazy around putting.   Just solid.  
   
 Q.   18, you really struggled there but a nice 8-footer to save par.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   It was nice.   I bogeyed it yesterday.   You know, was trying to make birdie but, you know, after a couple chip-outs, I was pleased with the par.  
   
 Q.   All right.   7-under in the hunt on the weekend.   Good luck.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Thank you.
