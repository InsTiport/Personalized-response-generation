  Q. Takeaways from your round today, excellent play.
 CAMERON TRINGALE:   Thank you, take away, just really patient, hit a lot of nice shots and was able to just not force it, I think that's one thing out here you don't want to do is when the conditions are like they are is start forcing it.
 So I just took my time and was able to make some nice putts and hit some good shots at the end after a couple bumps.
 Q. A lot of birdies.  What would you say was one of the shots of the day for you?
 CAMERON TRINGALE:   Really on the first hole I hit a nice little 8-iron to about a foot and it was just nice to hit two really good shots and get under par early and I think it just gave me the confidence to swing freely and have fun and go for it.
 Q. How would you describe playing this event this year without the amateur portion?  What differences are you finding?
 CAMERON TRINGALE:   Well I always love the amateurs.  I find it relaxing.  We played a lot quicker today, but we were also the first group out.
 So it definitely doesn't have the same feel as the tournament, but once you start playing it kind of felt like Sunday feels here on a normal year, just with threesomes and, yeah, it's definitely not what it normally is but I think everyone's excited to be here.
 Q. We're all very aware of weather forecasts here at Pebble Beach.  Any changes as you go to prepare going into the rest of the week with our forecast right now?
 CAMERON TRINGALE:   Nope, no, not for me.  I mean it is what it will be, it was supposed to be a lot worse than this today, so just never know.  I'll just keep doing my thing.
