 Q.  I'm sure it's not the finish you wanted, but how would you describe your round today?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: It was a good round.  I played really nicely, hit a lot of good iron shots and converted most of the chances when I hit it close.  So it was a good day, a lot of good things to take home.   
 Q.  Did the wind pick up at all in the afternoon?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Not really.   
 Q.  What were the conditions like?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: It was docile, a little bit of wind but nothing to overthink, and the golf course held up nice, good shape.  Excited for the weekend.   
 Q.  Coming off a T5 or actually had a T5 at Rocket Mortgage a couple weeks ago.  How does that help your confidence coming here?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I think I'm just looking to do a little better.  That's always the case.  But I feel comfortable with my game.  I played in the second-to-last group a few weeks ago, and I just feel like my game is clicking and excited to see how I can stand up to the challenge.   
 Q.  In the mix heading into the weekend; what's your mindset?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Just keep doing what I'm doing, hit a few more fairways.  Today I hit a couple out of play and had to chip out, and that's really been the only thing lacking in my game.  Just keep doing what I'm doing and hit a few more tee shots in the fairway.
