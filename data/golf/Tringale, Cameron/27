Q.   Some thoughts.
CAMERON TRINGALE:   It was really a fun week.   You know, I had a couple good guys to stay in the Houston with, some friends, and it was just a relaxing week looking forward to that vacation and, you know, it was fun today.   Got the play with two of the best players in the game and learned something and, you know, to catch Matt, I needed a great round and I just played good.   So, but a great learning experience and, you know, pumps me up to get back at it and do it again soon.

Q.   What about your game are you most specifically happy with for the week?
CAMERON TRINGALE:   My putting, really.   I mean, the tournament, the tournament from last week to this week is incredible.   I got to see my coach this week, Tuesday and Wednesday, James Sieckmann, there really wasn't a whole lot wrong.   Mostly in my head.   He kind of reminded me of that.   It helped me, you know, to have a little more confidence.   And my attitude was a lot better this week, just being nice to myself, not getting down. 
3-putted like my third hole on Thursday, and my caddy gently reminded me that, you know, our goal is to stay positive and have a good attitude.   From there on out, I really rolled the ball nicely.

Q.   You have had some pretty good success here.   What is it about this that suits your game?
CAMERON TRINGALE:   To be honest, I'm not sure because I don't hit it that far and -- but I do generally play the par-5s well, and, you know, with four of them, if I can keep it in play, I'm going to have a chance to get near the green in 2 and let my short game do the work. 
But, I don't know.   I think just tee to green, it fits my eye, a lot of right to left holes, and, you know, the greens are so good.   If you are rolling it nice, you can sure make a lot of putts.
