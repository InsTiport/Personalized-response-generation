Q. You found six birdies out there today, including a birdie, birdie finish.  Tell me about the golf course and your round?
CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, it was nice to get out before the wind and play the back nine this morning.  Really kind of it was a slow start.  I birdied the first hole but then just a lot of pars till 18.  Got another birdie to get to 1-under on the back and then I just kind of had a nice run there on the front.  I chipped in.  Left myself in easy places when I missed the green and I holed a couple putts.
Q. Appears to be that these greens are getting really firm and fast.  The whole golf course is getting fast.
CAMERON TRINGALE: It is definitely brown out there.  I saw them watering the 16th green as I walked over to the scoring tent.
It is dry.  You've got to be thoughtful about just where you're leaving the ball.  Sometimes you know you can't even hit the green, so it's try and think two shots ahead.
