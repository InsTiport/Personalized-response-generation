CAMERON TRINGALE: It was up and down.  I had a nice, nice stretch to start off, birdied the 11th, made a bogey, made a few more birdies before the turn and then hit a tough stretch, 2 and 3 made bogey and then a couple birdies coming in.  Kind of up and down, ebbing and flowing and kind of stayed patient.  I knew it was soft and easy without the wind.   
 Q.  Through two days what's kind of been the key for you?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Just not trying to do too much.  I think this golf course can tempt you to go for it.  To be honest, I haven't been playing that good and so I'm just trying to keep it in front of me and keep hitting a lot of fairways and greens.   
 Q.  What needs to change for the weekend?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I've hit it well so far these two days.  You don't need to make ten birdies out here.  I can give myself some chances, wedges and putter when I get the chance.   
 Q.  Did you have any trepidation about coming into this tournament?  Looking at the scorecards, your form hasn't been that great at this event.  
 What have you learned about the golf course?   
CAMERON TRINGALE: I haven't been here in five years so I tried to forget everything I learned.  I figured a five year break would do the trick and I'm just trying to have fun, you know.  Golf is hard and especially on a course that I haven't played well at.  I just have a different kind of mindset coming in this week.
