 Q.   Your second hole of the day, you hole out from a green‑side bunker and your next to last hole of the day you drop a 40‑footer.   No wonder there's a smile on your face?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, it was a nice day.   I've been hitting a lot of bunker shots in practice.   So it was no surprise, but it was nice to get one early, especially after the birdie on the first.   I did a lot of things well to stay in it.  
   
 Q.   You must love this golf course?   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   This is a nice course.   Short hitters love it.   Long hitters love it.   Everyone can play it.   It's a good test of golf.   
It's not who is the greatest putter from 15 feet, it's playing the game, shaping shots, thinking your way around, there's not a lot of holes where you step on the tee and expect to make birdie, so you've really got to earn them out there and play strategically, and a lot of different clubs off the tee this week and a lot of mid range irons into the greens.   
   
 Q.   This is such a game of momentum, you had a good start on the West Coast, and then kind of a little slump, now do you feel like you're coming back up just at the right time?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, I played a lot of golf, so I needed a little break and had last week off down at home just across the state here and was able to work on my game and I feel fresh for this week.
