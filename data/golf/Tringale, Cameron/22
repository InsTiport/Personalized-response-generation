Q.   2â€‘under par, Georgia Tech alum.   I asked you how many times have you played this course before entering the TOUR Championship, and your answer was?
CAMERON TRINGALE:   This year I come back to a place that I'm familiar with.   Haven't played in the TOUR Championship. 
This was my first time.   It's good to be back in my college town.   It's really fun, and it's a thrill to be in this tournament.

Q.   You started peaking at the right moment, you certainly did that at the Barclays, tied for second, best career finish during the playoffs, and now you're on this huge stage.   What have these last four weeks been like for you?
CAMERON TRINGALE:   It's been neat (indiscernible)   the word "playoff."   Everyone wants to play well this week.   That's kind of the peak of our season right here. 
So it's pretty satisfying.   It makes me want to get back next year.

Q.   Right now you're just one off the lead.   As someone who had never been in the TOUR Championship but has played this course, do you feel like you maybe you have an added advantage heading into Friday?
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I mean, everyone here is so good.   But I definitely feel like I know the greens.   They're in perfect shape.   This golf course is in just fantastic condition. 
And I've seen a lot of shots here.   I've hit a lot of good drives that I can recall.   Like 16 today.   It was tough shot, the wind was off to the left.   Fairway slopes left to right.   And I just said I've hit this tee shot a hundred times right down the middle, let's do it again.
