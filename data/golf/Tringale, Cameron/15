 Q.  Cameron, just a couple quick comments.  Just assess your week as a whole here.  Nice playing all week.  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Thank you.  I'm pleased with the week for sure.  I was 2-over, looking like I was going to miss the cut if there was such a thing here, and I just stayed patient.  I knew that there was a lot of golf left, and just really played awesome golf the last three days.  Holed some nice putts and really wedged it nicely, and I gave myself somewhat of a chance.   
 Q.  And you've got a little bit of a chance.  How much would that mean to get back to Atlanta for the second straight year?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: It would be awesome.  It was totally not even on the radar.  I was just wanting to come and play golf this week.  It would be great to get back to Atlanta and push back my vacation a little bit.  We'll see.
