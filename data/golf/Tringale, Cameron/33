 Q.   Good playing today.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, the greens were pretty receptive so I felt like you could go at the flags and be a little more aggressive.   
Yeah, really hit everything pretty well.   Made a couple nice.  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, I was hitting it where I was looking and the greens were pretty receptive so I felt like you could go at the flags, be a little more aggressive and really hitting the ball nicely and did everything pretty well.   Made a couple of mental mistakes but did everything pretty nicely.   
   
 Q.   What happened on the par 5 ‑‑  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I was kind of in between clubs and trying to go right at it, and I had been hitting it well all day and I figured just another one, but I made a mistake on club selection there.   
Fortunately the wind was off to the right today so you feel like if you do hit it a little bit over the water, you might have a chance coming back, but that was the easiest flag on the green, too.
