   THE MODERATOR: Cameron, got to 7-under today. Talk about your round. 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: 7-under 64 at my home course here in Las Vegas. It's a good one. I just plodded along. I made birdies when I had my chances. Rolled a couple of nice putts in. You know, add 'em up. 
 THE MODERATOR: You're a rookie on TOUR this season. Grew up in California. Played at Georgia Tech. How did you decide to move out to Vegas? 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Well, at the Walker Cup, when I played there last September, Ricky Fowler said, Going out to Vegas and would love to have you come move out there with me. I thought, Why not. It would be a good experience to get away. To golf here is great. 
 It's a good place to travel out of. Lot of benefits living here. Yeah, here I am. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Yes, yes. 

 Q. What happened on No. 8? 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: No. 8. Yeah, I was trying to hit a 3-iron into there. I just double crossed it a little bit and kind of pulled it. Hit it actually not too far from the green, kicked down to the left. Didn't have a very good chip there. Had about a 15-footer left for par down the hill that broke a little more than I thought. That was it. 

 Q. Was it hard to get over the disappointment of losing a shot there? 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: No, not really. One of my goals recently has been to not let anything stop me from playing well. I know if I just stay positive, let it roll off my back, that's the best way for me to play golf. 
 I try not to live and die on every shot and every hole. Just take a long-term view. One bogey for the day is not too bad on a tough hole. So just move on and try and make up for it at the last. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: I think it takes practice. When I was at school at Georgia Tech, that was the most important thing I learned, was really how to manage yourself. One thing Coach Heppler always drilled in me was, you know, You're good enough. Just go out there, do your thing. Stay positive, be your best friend out there. That's what I try and do. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Playing-wise? The score is pretty good. I feel like I've been playing well lately. I've been close. I think the difference is just a couple more putts falling today. So hopefully I can go out there tomorrow and keep at it. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: They were soft all day. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, they had a mark or two on them the last nine. But the course is in great shape, considering the rain it's had. They're rolling at a nice speed, so it's good. 

 Q. (Question regarding club selection.) 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: I guess, I mean, not really off the tees. I pretty much stuck to the same routine off the tees. Coming into greens, I'd maybe take a lesser club, swing easy, choke up to try to take some of the spin off. That was really the bigger concern, was on the greens, trying to keep the ball from backing up.

 Q. Were you more aggressive than you might normally be? 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, I mean, I think everyone was. With the course being wet, you can be a little more aggressive with the longer clubs. Sometimes it wreaks havoc with the wedges, like I was saying. 
 But, yeah, I mean, this tournament, you got to shoot low to win. If you've got a good number, you're trying to make birdie. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAMERON TRINGALE: I didn't look at the board before I teed off. It's only Monday. Doesn't mean much. Yeah, I didn't have a number in mind. I think you limit yourself when you do that. If you think 67, 64, that's what I got to shoot, who is to say you're not going to shoot 10 or 11. I went out there with no thoughts as far as the score. 

 Q. Go out and play a good round?
 CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, go out and make some good, positive swings, keep momentum going. That's what you got to do. 

 Q. Do you have a number for tomorrow? 
 CAMERON TRINGALE: I'd take four 64s, but I'm not thinking numbers. You just got to play the golf course because it could blow 30 or 40 tomorrow. Couple under is a great score. All depends. Just go try and make the best score you can.
