Q.     A day where the course played tough, but still in the mix on Sunday. 
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, it was up‑and‑down.   I bogeyed early but I bounced back well today.   Made some nice birdies but I really didn't make the most of my opportunities.   Hit a lot of fairways again and in a couple first cuts.   But the iron game, coming up short pretty much all day.   That was kind of the story of the round.   But I'll get it sorted out for tomorrow.

Q.   The course is difficult enough; how has it become more challenging over the past few days? 
CAMERON TRINGALE:   I don't know, I thought the pins today were the easiest of the three days.   I don't know if the scores reflect that or not.   I've been building confidence as the week has gone on, so I think I have a good chance for tomorrow.
