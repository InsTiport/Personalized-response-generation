CAMERON TRINGALE: You know, it was a solid day overall.  I hit a lot of good shots and made some nice putts, so pretty happy with where I'm sitting.   
 Q.  Makes that eagle on 9 to finish even better?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I mean, they're always good.   
 Q.  You finished today with a 65, not a 64 actually because of a one-stroke penalty on No. 12.  What happened there?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Basically I just forgot to put my coin back down, and I touched the ball on the green.  I learned that that was a penalty after my round.  I wasn't sure about the rule.  I just called an official in to get a sure answer, and that was it.   
 Q.  Still, a very solid round.  You said you made more putts today.  How much fun did you have out there, especially with two eagles on the card?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  My dad loves eagles, and him not being here this week, it's just been nice he can follow online.  It was a lot of fun.  I hit a lot of really nice shots, some nice putts, and looking forward to the next couple rounds here.   
 Q.  You had a heck of a second shot into your last hole, No. 9.  Talk about that shot and what was going through your head.  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, sure.  I had like 252 to the hole, and it was just a nice hybrid.  I was joking with Jason Bohn, he got a great little bounce, and I yelled for a "Bohn bounce" there, just into the fringe and rolled up there to about six feet and was able to knock that one in for an eagle, so it was a good finish.   
 Q.  Here's the putt right here.  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, it was just outside the right edge, kept my head down, just listened for it to go in.
