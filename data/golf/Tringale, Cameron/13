 Q.  Talk about your second place finish.  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Well, still some guys out there, so you don't know exactly, but I was happy with how I played for the most part.  I got off to a good start.  I was the first guy out at 10-under, so I felt like I needed to set the pace and get out in front the way this golf course finishes; it's got some birdie chances on the back nine.  I did that, but just made a couple of poor swings and made a few bogeys on the back side and was able to rally and made a couple birdies there on 16 and 17, which I was proud of myself for getting back in it and having a putt there on 18 for the tie.   
 Q.  What did you learn about yourself with your game this week?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: You know, I just learned golf is truly 90-plus percent mental.  I was struggling physically with my game.  I didn't even make a birdie in the pro-am on Wednesday, but just kind of made up my mind that I was going to be on my own team, be my best friend, just stay positive, and I just ended up feeding a really good week.   
 Q.  How much fun did you have last night?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: Yeah, I saw -- a friend texted me and then I saw the highlight.   
 Q.  So you didn't see it live?  
CAMERON TRINGALE: I didn't see it live, no, but pretty exciting stuff.  You know, it's a great week so far.
