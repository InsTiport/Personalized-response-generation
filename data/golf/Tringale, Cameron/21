 Q.   Cameron, so one of nine players, first time, first‑timers.   But obviously you played the course a lot.   Talk about the experience of being one of the first‑timers?   
CAMERON TRINGALE:   It's been neat.   It's a place I've been to so many times.   But to be here with the fans, Tuesday and Wednesday, the practice round, it's been a bit surreal with 28 other guys.   
It's been pretty cool.   Feels like a little club.   Everyone's here had a great year and all excited to be here and the fans too, the FedExCup, is pretty neat.   
   
 Q.   And we ask most guys, goals at the beginning of the year.   Most of them, this is probably on that list.   On yours?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   Yeah, absolutely.   This is‑‑ the PGA TOUR now has become about the FedExCup Playoffs and this is what we're all chasing, Player of the Year.   
To be in this field is a huge accomplishment for me.   And I'm excited to see what I've got the next three days.  
   
 Q.   Good start.   Obviously FedExCup, kind of the ultimate goal here.   With the math, obviously anyone can win.   Saw Bill Haas win from 24th.   What is your outlook knowing the course and playing it?  
CAMERON TRINGALE:   So much can happen.   A lot of golf over the next three days.   And I'm not really concerned about that.   My goal is this whole playoff season was to not let a tournament get in the way of the good golf I feel I'm playing.
