Q. Talk about your round a little bit today.  Nice round.CAMERON TRINGALE: Thank you.  Yeah, it was pretty steady day out there.  I got off to a bit of a slow start.  I had that easy first hole and both guys in my group birdied 1 and 2 and then Brendon holed a putt on 3, so I was kind of feeling behind. But made about a 15-footer for birdie on 3. Hit it close on 4. Steady pars, birdied the par-5, hit a few close.  Just really was a combination of driving it in the fairway and then giving myself chances with the irons.  Then I hit a few nice iron shots and then just converted the putts.Q. Do you feel like when you play the North Course that you have to post a number?CAMERON TRINGALE: Definitely it helps.  Mentally, just, yeah, it helps, just the South Course is a beast, so you can kind of go over there feeling like you're in a good position and three days in a row now hopefully on that golf course, so be able to change gears and just, yeah, fairway, green, type of golf.Q. What part of your game is most important and what were you doing well today as well?CAMERON TRINGALE: I drove it in the fairway pretty consistently.  I missed a few.  But I hit a lot of good iron shots, really and gave myself chances.  Then just on the greens out here, being in quality position underneath the hole, giving myself uphill putts is huge. So, started skidding it off the tee though.  You got to be in the fairway to have a chance.  I assume the South Course is still firm and playing tough, so a lot of greens and take your chance with a putt and walk off smiling tomorrow.
