Q. You got out there kind of early and really steady play out of you?
CAMERON TRINGALE: Thank you.  It was fun going with Brandt.  He was hot early and saw a bunch of putts going in and followed suit with a few of my own.  It was a steady day.  The wind was tough.  It was kind of swirling in that valley like it does, but I was able to get a birdie at the last.
Q. Was the course a little more manageable today?  Were the greens a little bit more receptive?
CAMERON TRINGALE: Not really.  I don't know why they would be any softer.  The wind's been blowing.
Q. They did put some water on them overnight.  I thought maybe they were a little softer.
CAMERON TRINGALE: It was hard to tell.  I played late yesterday, so I was a couple hours earlier, so they were appropriate for what I was expecting.
Q. What are you expecting on Sunday?
CAMERON TRINGALE: More of the same.  I mean, I'll tee off a bit later tomorrow, which is a good thing.  I'll just keep it one swing at a time.  It's easy to lose your head out there.  If I can just stay focused and stay patient, I'll be all right.
