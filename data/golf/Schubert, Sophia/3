Q. An incredible week of golf, really impressive, but today you came out firing from the get-go.  You were in control, 4-up after the first 18.  How did you manage to stay so poised the entire day on this stage?
SOPHIA SCHUBERT: Yeah, well, I just had a mindset that I can't get too high, can't get too low, stay focused the whole time, and my coach really helped me maintain that.
Q. Your the third Texas Longhorn to add your name to the list of champions here at the U.S. Women's Amateur.  What does it mean to you to pull this off, especially with your coach on the bag?
SOPHIA SCHUBERT: Yeah, it means so much.  So many people from Austin have contacted me and said they're rooting for me, so it means the world to me to have done this for them and with my coach on the bag.
Q. We keep talking about DeLisa, your mother.  She's been here all week.  She's always by your side.  Your father Bill unfortunately had to miss this one, but he is watching at home along with the grandparents.  What do you want to say to them?
SOPHIA SCHUBERT: Hi, dad.  Hi, grandma and papa.  Thank you so much for watching and always supporting me my whole life.  I love you guys so much.
