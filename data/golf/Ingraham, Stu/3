 Q. Talk about the course today. 
 STU INGRAHAM: Obviously the course is muddy, muddy and muddy. Greens are great. The golf course is beautiful. I'm doing the best I can. I mean it's really, it's just so muddy it's incredible. Even walking around here is bad. 
 But at least we got some golf in. It's been a long day obviously for everybody. But the PGA did a great job and they do the best they can with the deck of cards they're dealt.

 Q. Give us an overview of your day. 
 STU INGRAHAM: Not too bad. No, I birdied the first two holes, I was tied for the lead right out of the gate I think. But then reality set in and made a couple bogeys and I came in and I was 1-over and the last 10 holes I made every par. I made 10 pars. I almost made a birdie. 
 But I'm pretty pleased, I'm 1-over, you know, it's been a long day, but 1-over's not too bad as a club professional. So I'm happy.
