 Q. Talk about your day if you would today. 
 STU INGRAHAM: Well, tee to green I wasn't bad. I had 38 putts, 39 putts. I had four 3-putts and a 4-putt. Putted the ball horrible and hit a couple bad chips. 
 Tee to green in the last four days have been great, but from the green to the hole, from the edge of the green to the hole -- and fairway bunkers have killed me. But it was a tough day, my allergies are awful right now. 
 It was still fun. Making the cut was a pleasure though. Still, having to walk out there -- but like I said, you can't have 38 putts expecting to have any good scores. So that was a struggle.

 Q. Talk about your week just as whole. 
 STU INGRAHAM: It was a good week. It was a long week. I found out that now I know why it's the Senior PGA Championship because of my feet. It was a mudfest. It was hard. It was a grind. It was fun, it was a grind, but I hit a lot of great shots, enjoyed my week greatly. 
 It was my first Senior PGA Championship. It is my 7th Major, but my first Senior PGA Championship, so it was fun. I learned a lot. I realize that from tee to green I'm, I am fine, but from green to hole, I got to get better, that's all.
