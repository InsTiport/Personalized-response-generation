 Q. A better start from last week?
 ANTHONY KIM: It was a lot better, 10 shots better. I played a lot better. I found my rhythm. I have got back into the golfing mindset. I made some pretty careless errors out there but good enough to make pars.

 Q. Good save at the last?
 ANTHONY KIM: I felt I made a bogey. I kind of avoided a double bogey. That hole is like a par four. I would have had a driver and eight iron but unfortunately it ended up in the trees.
I'm still driving it good. I'm excited with the way I'm playing.

 Q. Conditions tougher in the afternoon?
 ANTHONY KIM: I didn't get out here till about 11am. I didn't know how it played in the morning. I felt there was quite a bit of wind in the afternoon. The greens are starting to get a bit burnt out and they were crustier. My putting wasn't great but it was okay. I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.
