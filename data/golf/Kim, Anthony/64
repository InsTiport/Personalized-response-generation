  Q. Well done, nice putts coming in.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Thanks, yeah, it was a grind. Probably one of the toughest ball-striking days I've had in a long time, even with my injury. I feel good. I really stayed positive out there and made a couple key putts then to keep me in it. Not so bad to be in third after a rough day.  
  
  Q. You're only two back and you've got some time to go work the kinks out with your coach and get ready for this weekend.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Absolutely. Being two back is a blessing after the way I played today. It can only get better from here on in hopefully.
