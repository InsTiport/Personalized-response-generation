   ANTHONY KIM: I started out very well, unfortunately couldn't get anything going the rest of the day and made a couple it double-bogeys which hurts the score but I'm starting to figure my swing out.   
 So I'm happy with how I'm swinging. Hit a great drive on 18, great second shot. Hopefully I can make some putts tomorrow and make a run for it.   
  
  Q. What do you think of the course and how it's playing?   
 ANTHONY KIM: It wasn't that difficult. I just played very poorly today. The first seven holes I played pretty flawlessly, and I was happy with how I was hitting it, how I was putting and just unraveled on me on the last ten, 12 holes there. But still have a good day tomorrow ahead of me.   
  
  Q. What is your game plan for the last day?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Just try to make some birdies. I'm swinging great. I'm starting to hit the ball a lot better. I just made one poor swing on that par 5 on 16. So if I can get my swing in shape and just roll a couple of putts in, I should be okay.
