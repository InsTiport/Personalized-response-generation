   ANTHONY KIM: I just couldn't get it going. I hit a couple of squirrelly shots. I actually missed a three-footer on 10 and made a good one on 11. I thought I was getting it going and hit it in the middle of the next fairway and then I plugged it in the bunker on the left on 12 and made double there. I made a good double; I made a six-footer for double. I definitely played a lot better than the score showed so I excited about what I can do here the next couple of days
 I didn't get much on the back nine, especially with a drivable par and I missed a three-footer on the par 5 10th. I really couldn't get the ball in the hole, but it's starting to come. It's definitely a lot closer than it was.
 It's a little frustrating. I'm trying to score the best I can and I'm just not hitting the shots when I need to. I'm not putting myself in the best positions. I'm trying to fight through it and be patient.
 I haven't been in great form coming in so I really don't' have too high of expectations. I'm just trying to hit some quality golf shots. My momentum is swinging bad at the wrong time. When I made birdie on 11 and got it to 3 under I really should have focused a little more and h better shot to at least finish with par on 121. It's a tough golf hole. The little momentum swings are hurting me.
 On Mickelson... 
 ANTONY KIM: I don't know what he was doing, but I just found out that he didn't make a single bogey. Whenever you can do that out here, that's playing some good golf.
