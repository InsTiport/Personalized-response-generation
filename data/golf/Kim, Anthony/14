 Q. How is it coming?
 ANTHONY KIM: Unfortunately I didn't play my best this week. It's starting to come along. I know my scores aren't very good, borderline embarrassing scores, but I'm getting better and that's all I can really ask for.

 Q. Unfortunately for you you fell out of the Top 8 Ryder Cup at the PGA Championship. Are you still optimistic that you can get on that team as a Captain's Pick?
 ANTHONY KIM: I am. I know I put the Captain in a tough spot here falling out by one and now him having to make the choice but, hopefully, with enough practice I'll start getting my game into shape the next three weeks and make it an easy decision.

 Q. Have you had any conversation or communication with Corey about what you need to do over the next few weeks?
 ANTHONY KIM: No. Shot me a text. Just said, "Try to play well and we'll talk after it's over" and really that's all I can do. If I start focusing on making the team and who I got to beat out, that just makes things too confusing for me. I got to go out there and have fun.
