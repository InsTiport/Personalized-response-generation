   ANTHONY KIM: I've been struggling all year, haven't gotten putts to fall. Fortunately they've been falling good today, but that was all I had this week and this year obviously. It's disappointing, but I'll tell you what, I've worked real hard for the last month. I'm going to keep working hard and I'm going to be ready for next season.  
  
  Q. Are you playing anything in the fall?  
 ANTHONY KIM: I'm actually starting to swing it well. I'm starting to get healthier, so I feel like I'm going to try to play a little bit more in the fall than I thought.  
  
  Q. Is there disappointment about not going to Atlanta?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Absolutely. I mean, that's the goal at the end of the year, or at the beginning of the year, is to get there and have a chance to win. But unfortunately it didn't go my way this year, and I just didn't get the ball in the hole.
