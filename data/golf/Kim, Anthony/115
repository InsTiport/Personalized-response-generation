 Q. You finished 3, 3, 3, 40-29, what happened? 
 ANTHONY KIM: I don't know what happened. I woke up, I think. Yesterday I felt like the front nine, I didn't even feel like I was in my own body. 
 I didn't know what was going on. I felt uncomfortable out there. It wasn't the situation, it was just something with my golf game, my bead didn't feel the same. I just wasn't used to the 4:40 tee time that we just had. And coming over from England, I don't even know what time it was over there. It was just a wild, wild round. 

 Q. So what was the difference? You came into yourself? Finishing 3, 3, 3, that's got to get you fired up today?
 ANTHONY KIM: I made an eagle two holes before that, and made a birdie on 11. So turned it around starting on 10. 
 I don't know what happened. I just told myself to focus, and let it happen. Just try to go out there and do the same thing today. 

 Q. Is there any particular part of your game that kicked in that you noticed? 
 ANTHONY KIM: Every part of my game kicked in that wanted to show up. The driver started going straight again. The irons were going towards the flag or somewhat towards the green, and the ball wanted to disappear. 
 So it was just everything kind of came together. It was a good back nine. 

 Q. What did you hit into 18? 
 ANTHONY KIM: 4-iron. 

 Q. Okay, keep it up. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Thank you.
