   ANTHONY KIM: I hit the driver off the tee, and I was walking with it like I usually do, and wasn't angry or anything, just walking down the fairway. The toe hit the sprinkler, hit the top of the sprinkler and I looked at it and it looked a little bit different but I wasn't sure, and I put it in the bag.   
 On 8, I got up to the tee, and during my practice swing, I looked down, it looked a little bit different, but wasn't sure. And I hit it, the ball went about 150 yards and then dropped straight down and thought, you know, I didn't think anything of it, and I said, maybe it's really bent and I got another ball to hit a provisional because obviously that ball was out of play.   
 I put it down and it went 100 yards right and I looked down and it looked even worse. So on 9, we're looking for a rules official on 8, and we couldn't find one, so on 9, I found one, asked him the rule and told him exactly that story. He checked and on 10 green, Andy told me that if it, indeed, had changed, that it was a disqualification.   
  
  Q. Unfortunate ending.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, I mean --  
  
  Q. Nothing like that's ever happened before, I would imagine.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, I was pretty shocked. I didn't think that would be the case. But you know, the rules are the rules and I have no problem with that.   
  
  Q. Will it need a new head, or what do you think or was that the end of it?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Obviously I won't be using that driver again. We get free clubs. Not really worried about that driver.   
  
  Q. But it wasn't one that you really loved or anything?  
 ANTHONY KIM: No. Obviously I didn't -- I don't love it anymore, even if I did. Fell out of love.
