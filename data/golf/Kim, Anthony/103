  Q. Just your overall thoughts leading off tomorrow with Phil?   
 ANTHONY KIM: It's going to be exciting, something that I dreamed about, playing in The Ryder Cup, and it's finally coming true. We've got nothing to lose. We are going to go out there and free-wheel it and have some fun and just do what we've been doing.  
  
  Q. What does it meaning able to play with Phil, given his experience?   
 ANTHONY KIM: Obviously you learn a lot playing with a guy that has won 40 tournaments and whatever majors and all of the experience he has. I'm just trying to learn. Tomorrow we are going to go out there and forget about all of that stuff and just try to make birdies.  
  
  Q. Is this an aggressive type of course?   
 ANTHONY KIM: It is, and I'm looking forward to that because both Phil and I are very aggressive and we are going to shoot the a lot of flags and hopefully make a lot of putts.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the chance to meet Ali today?   
 ANTHONY KIM: Can't put it into words. That was pretty amazing. Never really got to watch him fight at all. Obviously you watch some of the stuff on ESPN Classic, but it was wild. I mean, I was very impressed with -- you kind of feel his aura and it's amazing.
