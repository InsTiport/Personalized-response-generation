  Q. You're the defending champion. How did you end up playing, feel like you played well enough for the day, I guess?  
 ANTHONY KIM: I scored okay. I'm happy with the score. I could have been out of the tournament. Fortunately, I played well enough to hang in there. So I have a shot tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to Sunday.  
  
  Q. Tough day. Did you learn anything from the first day?  
 I learned I could hit it all over the place. I'm excited I had shot 3-under par today, and hopefully I can go out there and shoot a low one tomorrow.
