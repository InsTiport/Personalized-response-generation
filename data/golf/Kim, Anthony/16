 Q. It was a long week obviously. You have a big smile on your face because you're coming back for the first time in a long time from the thumb injury. How do you feel?
 ANTHONY KIM: I felt good. The course beat me up out there, and I expected that to happen. It's a tough golf course, and to play out here with no practice I knew was going to be tough. But at the same time, I learned a lot about what I need to work on, and I actually don't feel as bad as my score showed this week.

 Q. What's the most difficult thing coming back from an injury like that?
 ANTHONY KIM: I think the decision making. Obviously you're going to make loose golf swings, but that happens with a little bit of rest. But I know that can get knocked off in a week. I just want to make better decisions next week. I know it's a major championship golf course, so the rough is going to be a little bit thicker and I'm going to have to be able to swallow my pride and chip out to the side instead of trying to go for everything and making double.

 Q. What's your professional take on Tiger Woods right now?
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, he's obviously struggling. I mean, he's not hitting it very well, and he's just not the regular Tiger we're used to seeing. He's obviously had a lot of stuff going on, and he's dealing with that, and that's obviously more important than golf because I think golf is an easy thing to do once your personal life is straightened out, and I'm sure it's going to happen soon for him.

 Q. Any chatter between you two for the 18 holes?
 ANTHONY KIM: There was a lot of chatter. We hit so many golf shots and they were all in the trees, so while we were walking in the trees together we had a lot of talking going on.
