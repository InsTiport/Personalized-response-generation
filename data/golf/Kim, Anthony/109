  Q. Thoughts on your round?  
 ANTHONY KIM: One of the toughest rounds I've ever played. Every hole was behind 18 trees, so just trying to shoot the ball into the fairway where I got a clean look at the hole.   
  
  Q. What happened with the bee sting? Was it a wasp? Do you know what it was?   
 ANTHONY KIM: I don't know what it was. It was weird, because I had two bees in my pants three holes later. You know, it was rough out there. When the bees are attacking you -- the course is hard enough, but when the bees start getting you, you're in trouble.  
  
  Q. They were saying that you took an antihistamine or something and that made you a little dizzy?  
 ANTHONY KIM: I felt a little lethargic out there. It was just I had some good momentum going and felt like things were turning around for me.   
 You know, unfortunately I couldn't finish it off, but hopefully I can work on that on the range today and maybe get back for tomorrow.
