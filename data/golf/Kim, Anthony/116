  Q. Talk about what a crazy day it was for to you come and finish that back nine?  
 ANTHONY KIM: It was a pretty long day today. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I had a great day today, and I hope to keep up the good golf.  
  
  Q. Did you ever think shooting that 40 you'd be in the final group on Sunday?  
 ANTHONY KIM: I wasn't thinking that far ahead after shooting 40 on the front. I'm just trying to take a shot at the time and try to chip away at that 40.  
 But, obviously, did a good job. My swing's coming back, and I feel comfortable out there.  
  
  Q. What are the challenges with these long days and hitting the shots, and all the rain and wet ground and stopping play?  
 ANTHONY KIM: It's always hard to stop and start. Especially when you have some momentum like I did when I finished birdie, birdie, eagle. I felt I had good momentum.  
 I would have liked to have gone off pretty soon, but, you know, that's just the way the cards fall sometimes. You just have to deal with it and just try to keep plugging away.  
  
  Q. (No microphone)?  
 ANTHONY KIM: I'm in a position -- I've put myself in a good position, I'm looking forward to the challenge tomorrow. I know I've got some good guys that are coming up, and obviously, Chez's playing some good golf, so looking forward to a good day.  
  
  Q. What changes did you make after 40?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Everything. Ball striking came back, my chipping came back, my putting came back. It's really those little momentum shots that you have to get up-and-down and make that 8-footer for par. And I feel like I'm doing a better job of that right now.
