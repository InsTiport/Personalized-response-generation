   ANTHONY KIM: I stayed patient and I'm happy with how I played. I just didn't score very well.  
  
  Q. What's your plan tomorrow?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Try to play some golf. Hopefully we can play some golf with the weather holds off and we can get in nine holes tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What's your plan tomorrow?   
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, we are just going to try to come out here and play some golf. It's going to be a long day for the guys in front of us and we are just going to hang in there and wait till we can go play some golf.   
  
  Q. How was today's conditions, weather, the greens?   
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, the greens were very slow. My last tournament was the Masters, so the greens were very fast here and here it's very slow.   
 So it's a little bit of an adjustment but hopefully I can do better tomorrow.
