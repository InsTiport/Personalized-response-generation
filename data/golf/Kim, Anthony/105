 Q. Anthony, that's a great tournament for you. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, it was good, just wish I could have finished a little bit stronger. Put myself in a good position, and if I keep doing that I should have some more success.

 Q. It's all about giving yourself chances. Two TOUR wins already, you knocked on the door again today. 
 ANTHONY KIM: I did. Camilo played great. He deserved it, made some key putts when it counted, and overall he just handled himself beautifully out there. I feel pretty good about this week.

 Q. Some players have two weeks off. You, my friend, are headed to Valhalla in a week for your first taste of Ryder Cup. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, that's really the only thing that's making me smile right now, I'm so excited to get out there and battle against the Europeans and have a great time.

 Q. Just the way the pairings built, you played with a lot of Ryder Cup teammates this entire week. 
 ANTHONY KIM: I did, it was great. I got to know some of the guys better. Jim and I have become friends and Phil and I have developed a relationship, and it's been great getting to know these guys.
