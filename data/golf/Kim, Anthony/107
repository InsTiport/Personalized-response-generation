   ANTHONY KIM: I played very well, probably my best ball-striking day, and looking forward to a good rest of the week.

 Q. Have you played with Phil before?
 ANTHONY KIM: I've played in a practice round with him. It was a little different obviously playing with him. Everyone is chanting his name and you're just trying to focus on your own game.

 Q. There's a lot of people out there for you, though, right?
 ANTHONY KIM: I would say most of them were out there for Phil, but if I keep playing good golf. He's put his time in, and he's obviously won everybody over, and that's what I'd like to do someday.

 Q. Does this course suit your eye?
 ANTHONY KIM: It does. It's a driver's golf course. You have to keep the ball in play, and I feel like there are some birdie opportunities if you put the ball in the middle of the fairway.
