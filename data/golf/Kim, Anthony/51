  Q. Big win, made a lot of birdies.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, it was a good day for me. I said yesterday that my game is coming around, and it sure did today. I played a lot more solidly. Unfortunately, Robert didn't have a great day, but I was lucky enough to win the match and hopefully help the U.S. to a win.   
  
  Q. So what are you going to do the rest of the day?   
 ANTHONY KIM: I'm going to enjoy this and cheer some of my teammates on.   
  
  Q. The past three days has been kind of a team effort, obviously singles effort today, and you do what you do best, you came out and tackled the job on your own; how much does that mean to you to single handedly earn a point for the team?  
 ANTHONY KIM: It means a lot. I've been struggling with my game all year, and obviously I had a couple of things to work on, and that's why I didn't play in the morning round.   
 But I dug deep and I played the way I know how, and fortunately enough, it was good enough today.  
  
  Q. What were you most pleased with as far as the part of your game that you were most pleased with that maybe had not been clicking?   
 ANTHONY KIM: Just overall my course management was a lot better. I was more positive over every shot and definitely tried to pick some better lines. Fortunately, that worked out for me today.
