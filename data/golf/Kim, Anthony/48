 Q. Congratulations on beating Retief. How did you feel about the way you've played today? 
 ANTHONY KIM: This is the first round I really played solid golf in probably over a year. Been scoring pretty sporadically, low scores, high scores but this was a consistent round with some great ball-striking.

 Q. You said yesterday you had been working hard with your coach recently, has that paid off? Has that been the thing that's clicked? 
 ANTHONY KIM: Sometimes you need somebody to kick you in the butt and Adam did a great job of getting my shape -- the shape of my shots, correctly. I've been missing it to the left and we took that out of play. 

 Q. You were 4-up and six to play. What's mind-set, the game plan then?
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, because it's important to get a huge lead, because if there is a tiebreaker, that counts. So we are just trying to keep the foot on the gas and keep going, because Retief is obviously a great player and he had a tough day today.

 Q. First time you've played in the World Match Play. How aware of it were you? Did you watch it on TV at home?
 ANTHONY KIM: I have. I watched when Tiger and O'Meara played and some of the bigger matches when Ernie played. It's a special event and I'm excited to be here in Spain. 

 Q. Thoughts on this afternoon's match because you have to go again?
 ANTHONY KIM: Same thing. I just have to get the ball on the green, make a few putts and I'm sure I'll have a good day.
