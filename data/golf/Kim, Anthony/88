 Q. Just real quickly, will you talk about your round today, how it went?
 ANTHONY KIM: I hit the ball very, very well on the back nine and didn't putt so great. Hit a lot of good putts I thought were going in and didn't go in. But I hit nine greens on the back and made one birdie. So it was a little bit frustrating, but happy with the outcome. It's under 80, so it's good for me.

 Q. Was it pretty wet out there?
 ANTHONY KIM: It was a little wet out there. It wasn't too bad. I don't think it's as big a deal as some people are making it out to be.
