 Q. (No microphone.)
 ANTHONY KIM: I got pretty fortunate today. I got some good breaks and I capitalized on those, so I'm pretty happy with the way I finished. 
 But I still have to work on the driver and get that ball in the fairway. 

 Q. You had that problem last week and you managed to get the W. So what about your expectations here?
 ANTHONY KIM: I'm just trying to get the ball in the fairway. That's, those are my expectations. I'm not worried about what I'm shooting, it's all about getting the ball in play. If I do that I should have a good chance. 

 Q. What do you think is in your swing that's causing this problem off the tee?
 ANTHONY KIM: I don't know. I'm going to work on it after this. We have been working on it the last couple weeks and we just haven't found out what's right for it. This morning after I hit balls after a good workout session last night I felt like I figured it out. But I got out here and didn't hit good shots. 

 Q. You had that amazing round here last year, were there shades of that today?
 ANTHONY KIM: A little bit. Just fortunate to get a couple good breaks and that's what you need to do to make -- I think I made 11 birdies. And hopefully I can just keep a steady pace and not go crazy. 

 Q. That was adventuresome last year. Can it be as adventuresome this year?
 ANTHONY KIM: I hope not. If need be I hope I can pull it off, but I would rather hit some fairways and make a couple putts.

 Q. Knowing you can make 11 birdies, how much did that help you today?
 ANTHONY KIM: Well I wasn't really even thinking about 11 birdies. I was just thinking about getting the ball play. I didn't hit it great last week and that, but I made a lot of putts.
