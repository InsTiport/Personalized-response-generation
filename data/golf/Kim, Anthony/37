 Q. Anthony, got off to a great start but couldn't get anything happening on the back nine. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, it was tough. I really grinded on that back nine. Unfortunately I didn't play the par-5s very well today, but it was really a good day, and hopefully I can get the ball rolling again here tomorrow.

 Q. Talk about conditions out there. They seemed to be perfect. 
 ANTHONY KIM: They were perfect. It was almost like playing golf in a dome. But when the wind came up, it was very tricky because we're so used to not worrying about it. But hopefully we can figure it out.

 Q. Do you feel comfortable going into the next 36 holes?
 ANTHONY KIM: I do. I'm playing really well, thinking well. My caddie and I are really jiving well, so hopefully we can get some putts to fall and give it a run on Sunday.
