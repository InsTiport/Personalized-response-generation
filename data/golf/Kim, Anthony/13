 Q. Bogey-free today, six birdies. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, it was a lot better today. I still missed probably four or five putts inside of seven or eight feet, and I've got to clean that up. But I'm getting the hang of it and I'm starting to roll the ball a little bit better.

 Q. Coming off an injury you always look for consistency. Obviously you found that in the second round. 
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, my game is really coming around. I'm driving it well. Unfortunately I'm hitting one or two squirrelly shots a round and that's costing me, but I'm getting better, and that's all I can afford.

 Q. The squirrelly shots, is that due to just getting back into tournament play slow after you missed most of last season?
 ANTHONY KIM: It is. I'm not making the ten-foot momentum putts that I need to make right now to save my round. Yesterday I missed a couple of those and missed a shot by a yard or two but picked the wrong target. I'm working on that, and I think it's going to be a good year for me.
