 Q. What's the key tomorrow, do you have to be aggressive or stay in your own game?
 ANTHONY KIM: Stay in my own game. If I made a couple of putts today, it's a totally different ballgame. I missed some putts on the first seven holes on the back nine. If I make those, it's a different story. 
 Obviously, Geoff is playing great and I'm going to have to make a lot of putts tomorrow.
