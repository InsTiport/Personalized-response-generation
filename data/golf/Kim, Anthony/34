 Q. Comment on the day, a tough day obviously?
 ANTHONY KIM: It was a tough day, but I played reasonably well. I just didn't score very well, but that happens, and I'm just happy to have grinded it out. 
 Unfortunately the last three holes, I made bogeys and cost myself a good chance to win this golf tournament, but you never know what can happen out here. 
 On this golf course, anything is possible. It's a difficult golf course, the wind can obviously affect your ball, and it did on a couple of holes to me today. Unfortunately I just made a couple too many mistakes. 

 Q. A lot of good scores out there?
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, I wouldn't say it was as low as yesterday but there were some good scores possible. 

 Q. Anything with the conditions bother you with all of the smoke? 
 ANTHONY KIM: No, it wasn't any of that. I played reasonably well except the last three holes, so it was unfortunate that that happened but I hung in there.
