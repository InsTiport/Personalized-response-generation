   ANTHONY KIM: There are a lot of positive things coming out, unfortunately I'm not scoring as well as I would like. It's a tough golf course and you just have to be patient and take what the course gives you.
 I missed a couple of short putts and usually I hammer those in. Unfortunately they haven't been catching too much of the hole but it's the same stroke I've been using that had been making all the short ones. If I can just find a way to make a couple more putts I'll be in good shape. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and looking forward to hitting the ball a little bit better.
 It was a pretty successful day even though I didn't score the best. I feel like my game is moving in the right direction. If I can play better on Saturday and Sunday, I should be in good shape.
 I made two double bogeys from the middle of the fairway, and those are pretty disappointing. I just have to keep my head on straight and stay positive. I made some rookie mistakes out there. I fired at some flags that I probably shouldn't have.
 On Mickelson Â…
 ANTHONY KIM: He's playing a lot better than I am. I'm just trying to hang on out there. He and I have become good friends, and if I watch what he is doing maybe I'll learn a little bit.
