 Q. Are you enjoying it playing this way a little more?
 ANTHONY KIM: I'm glad I'm playing on the weekend. It's been tough to just make it to Saturday and Sunday out here. There's so much going on, and it's hard to stay focused. But I'm doing a good job of it and my caddie is keeping me in line and just kind of making a couple birdies along the way.

 Q. Have you been pretty happy with the way you've played?
 ANTHONY KIM: I am. Yesterday was the best ball-striking day I've had since I turned professional. I hit 17 greens, and the only green I missed was by a foot, and I hit 13 of 14 fairways. Really a good round, and unfortunately I didn't hit it that great today, but I got myself out of some trouble and very happy with how I scored today.

 Q. What did you think of -- it's not your average tournament?
 ANTHONY KIM: It's definitely not. If this were an average golf tournament there would be a lot more people enjoying and playing golf. Hopefully there can be a lot more tournaments that turn out like this because the Thunderbirds do such a great job out here.

 Q. A lot of young guys on that leaderboard right now. Are you kind of looking forward to the weekend and maybe playing -- seeing how you guys match up?
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, this is just one golf tournament. At the end of the day, you're going out there to win, but I can just go out and play my own game and try to do what I've been doing, stay patient, and whatever happens, happens. I'm happy with the fact that I can just stay patient and move along that way. 

 Q. The Ryder Cup is coming up at the end of the year. What are your expectations?
 ANTHONY KIM: Well, I have to make the team, so I have to play a little bit better. But I'll tell you once I start playing a little bit better.
