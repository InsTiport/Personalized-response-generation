  Q. Your reaction on golf getting into the Olympics?  
 ANTHONY KIM: It just means the game is going to grow and it can never hurt to have younger kids playing in the Olympics, and having golf be a part of it, it's going to be\by big deal and hopefully it will inspire a bunch of kids from a lot of different countries to take up the game and make the game better.  
  
  Q. What would it mean for you to be part of the Olympics and to represent your country?   
 ANTHONY KIM: That's something I haven't really thought about. It was never an option.   
 But now that it is, it's probably going to be a tremendous honor whenever you get a chance to represent your country, and especially in the Olympics.
