  Q. Well played today. You just came up one shy.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, I played tough. I still didn't get my swing back, but I scored pretty well for how bad I was playing.  
  
  Q. And you kept a smile on your face the whole way. You've been very professional these last two weeks.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Thank you. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. When you don't have it you're just out there grinding. I had a great time.   
 Obviously you want to win the golf tournament, but I had a good showing and can't be too disappointed in myself.  
  
  Q. Are we going to see you in the Fall Series?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Probably not in the Fall Series, but I'll be back next year.
