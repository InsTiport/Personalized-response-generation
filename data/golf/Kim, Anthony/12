  Q. You looked so relaxed like you were just having a good time out there. Was that what the case was?   
 ANTHONY KIM: It was. I was looking forward to this round. Just coming back to California and especially playing in front of my parents. That's pretty special every time I get to do that.   
 So I was relaxed out here, the views are unbelievable, and obviously playing with Tiger is a lot of fun. So I had a lot of good things today.  
  
  Q. Do your parents get out to see you playing much? When you're playing with Tiger, you probably get a little kick?  
 ANTHONY KIM : I don't know if they're used to all of that, but they should start getting used to it.  
  
  Q. Tell me about your game. What were you happiest with going into today?   
 ANTHONY KIM : To be honest, my ball striking was really, really solid before I played today. I kind of hit it all over the maps. So the putter saved me. I'm using the new Nike putter that I put in on Tuesday, and obviously it worked.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 ANTHONY KIM : Yeah, as long as we have uphill putts, we talked about we're going to miss some greens out here, especially with the rough the way it is.   
 We're just trying to leave ourselves some uphill putts. So obviously for both to fall on these greens is a bit of Luck too. So I was happy with how I rolled it, and hopefully I can stay putting as well.
