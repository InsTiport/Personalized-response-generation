  Q. Wondering if you can talk about your round today.   
 ANTHONY KIM: It was pretty solid round overall, but had a stretch of five holes there where I putted poorly and just hit some poor shots and two of the bogeys I made on the par 3s, I hit really good shots and ended up in pretty bad position.   
 So overall, it was a good day and it's frustrating not to make more birdies and be a little closer but still have a chance.  
  
  Q. Can you just talk about your play and coming back with the birdie at the end?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, to make birdie on the last hole is really going to make dinner taste a lot better tonight. I made bogey on the par 5 yesterday to finish up, that was pretty frustrating.   
 So I've got some positive things to look forward to, and hopefully I can keep it up.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing and how did the weather affect it?  
 ANTHONY KIM: It played pretty easy today. Usually if you shoot 1-under par, you're hanging in there pretty well. The only thing was playing this far back, there was a lot of bumps on the greens, and it happens everywhere, but especially on poa annua.
