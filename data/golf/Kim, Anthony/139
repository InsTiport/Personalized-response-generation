 Q. On the range this morning it was a little wet.  You probably thought it would be really good when you started off. 
 ANTHONY KIM:  I thought it would be good.  I started off really well and obviously couldn't get the putts to fall on the back nine, but even par on my back side, 4-under on the front, is not bad.  So I'll take it and I'm happy with that. 

 Q.  You've got the course tomorrow that's probably playing about three shots harder than this course, so you need to hit it in the fairway and do the right things. 
 ANTHONY KIM:  I'm going to try to play smart.  I've been doing that the last six tournament days of golf and just keep that up, and whatever I shoot, I shoot.  Just give myself some opportunities to make birdies on the holes that allow and try to make a lot of pars. 

 Q.  You're a young guy.  "Smart" is a thing that we didn't have when we were kids, and it's impressive that you've taken it to the next level and realized how to play a golf course at such a young age. 
 ANTHONY KIM:  Thanks.  You know, I've been playing with guys like Mark O'Meara and Jeff Sluman and all the veterans have helped me get to where I am.  I'm playing a lot smarter than I would have if I didn't play with those guys.  So the credit really goes to them, and I'm fortunate to have that opportunity.
