  Q. Probably a little disappointed, not the result you were looking for today.   
 ANTHONY KIM: Yeah, it was a little disappointing.   
 I played a lot better today than I did yesterday, but Oliver played great and I just didn't make enough putts.  
  
  Q. That's match play right?  
 ANTHONY KIM: Yes. No, it's one day of golf, I'm not going to hang my head over it.   
 It's unfortunate that I didn't get the job done, but we'll go get 'em at Doral.
