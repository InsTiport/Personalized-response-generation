 Q. Describe to me your shot on 13 with the hole-in-one?
 CHIP BECK: I hit the ball, it looked like I played it a few feet left of the flag, and when I hit it, I said, man, I hit a good one. I was happy I hit a good one, because I haven't hit the green the last couple days. 
 And when it hit it took one bounce, boom, second bounce right in the hole. I thought, wow, that was amazing. 

 Q. Okay. 
 CHIP BECK: So that's about as good as I could hit it. 

 Q. Now what was going through your head? Would you kind of describe that? Did you have any emotions?
 CHIP BECK: I was happy to move forward. I mean, it was exciting. It was just exciting to make a hole-in-one like that. It really turned my score around for the day. And it got me going in a real positive direction, which was really encouraging.

 Q. Have you been fairly happy with your play throughout the rounds here?
 CHIP BECK: I have been. I know that I made real progress this week. I shot 69 today on a really good golf course and I think that is good for the future. It bodes well. 

 Q. Where do you go from here?
 CHIP BECK: To Des Moines. And we're going to play there and that should be a lot of fun. I'm excited about it. I think it's the first step in some really good golf for me.
