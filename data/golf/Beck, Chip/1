  Q. So you played really consistent the last two days, what have you done to do that?  
 CHIP BECK: I've been driving it well, hitting the irons well, and putting well. I don't know what more you can say. But it's very challenging. I gave a few back to the course today. I 3-putted -- actually, just didn't get it up-and-down from behind the green on 1.   
 I bogeyed 4 with a missed putt from pretty close.   
 But it was unusual.   
 Then I was able to birdie 8 with a nice drive up the middle of the green in the back bunker and got it up-and-down.   
 And you know what, I made some really nice birdies on the back side, three birdies, I birdied those two little short holes at 13 and 14 which is really good. Because I hit the ball close both times.   
 And then didn't birdie the par-5s, but they were playing tough today. So I birdied 17, that was really sweet.   
 Actually, I missed one tee shot today and it was on 18. And I didn't have much of a lie in the bunker. And I laid it up and made bogey there.   
 So, but the golf course is great, it's a lot of fun. I really enjoy it. I'm just glad to be in Colorado and I feel like my game is in good shape. I like that.
