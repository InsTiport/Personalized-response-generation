Q. The front nine gave you the most birdies, your back nine today.
OLI FISHER: Yeah, today I putted really well.  I didn't play great today but made a nice par save I think on the 16th, which might have been my seventh hole.  Made a par on 18, and then turned really nice.  Had a good birdie on 1 and 2.  Great putt on 2 and made a nice birdie on the fourth, up-and-down there, and then a nice putt again on the sixth.
So it was nice to come back at minus four.
Q. You had to plot your way around this golf course a little bit more than you would normally over the last two days.
OLI FISHER: It's my first time here, so we're still learning it as we go, really.  I think this course, if you're in play, it gives you a lot of opportunities.  If you're out of position, it's pretty tricky, and I think the score reflects that.
Q. 11-under par, two off the lead.  Your thoughts going into Saturday and Sunday?
OLI FISHER: I think just much of the same really.  Just go out and try and hit good shots and make some putts.
