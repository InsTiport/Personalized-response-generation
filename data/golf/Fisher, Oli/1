Q. Three birdies and one bogey.  What's your verdict on that one?
OLI FISHER: I would probably say that was a fair score for how I played.  I didn't feel like I had great control of the ball today but probably struck it a little bit better than I did yesterday.
Putting from distance is quite tough, so it was a little bit breezy, and the sun's been out, so judging distance and stuff on the greens has been a little bit more difficult today I think.  But fair score for how I played.
Q. Came into this tournament 100th in The Race to Dubai.  What's been the difference this week?  Why have you played better?
OLI FISHER: I think I've been in some good positions the last few weeks after 36 holes, so I mean, hopefully I can put a good fourth round in tomorrow.  My game's not bad.  I'm playing okay.
You know how it is out here:  You can play pretty solidly for quite a long time and make cuts, and you just need a little bit of spark and kind of get up-and-down and make that par putt when you need to, sort of thing.  I feel like my game is not a million miles away and I putted nice the first couple of days.
Q. How much are you benefitting from the experience of Wobbly on the bag?
OLI FISHER: Yeah, a lot I think.  Wobbly's good.  He keeps it fun most of the round, which I think is really important for me.  It's great to have that experience there.
