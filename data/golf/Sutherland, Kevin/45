Q.  Talk about your match. 
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   I played very well today.  I hit a lot of greens.  I didn't hit every green I played.  I played really solid. 
And David played well.  He missed a couple of putts, but I just played very well today. 

Q.  Has it reached a point for you that you think you can win no matter who you playing?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   Yeah, I think I can win.  I would not be playing if I didn't think I could win.  Everyone I beat, it's a huge upset, but I'm playing really well.

Q.  Azinger said he thought the course was playing a lot tougher today. 
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   It's playing tough.  You've got to hit it well and you've got to drive it straight.  You know, it's playing tough.
