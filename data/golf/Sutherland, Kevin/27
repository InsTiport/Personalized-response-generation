  Q.  Tough conditions when you started out.   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND:  Yeah, you know, I'm kind of proud of what I did today.  2nd hole, my ball moved when I was addressing it and I had to move it back.  I just kind of nudged it with my putter, so I got a one-stroke penalty right off the bat.  I was like, this is great.  So I made double on the second hole.   
 But after that I played really solid.  I never even thought about the stroke penalty until the very last hole, thinking, you know, this would have been to tie.  That's the way it is.  I'm really pleased with how I played today.   
  
  Q.  As well you should be, and people don't understand how hard that is when something like that happens.  A lot of times that will shake you up for a good three or four holes, but you seemed to come back really quick afterward.   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND:  Yeah.  You know, as I said, I was proud of what I did.  The very next hole I hit a driver and a hybrid on the green about 20 feet and two-putted for birdie.  It was like I just kind of forgot about it.  I never thought about the 2nd hole the rest of the day.  It was not a nice way to start, but that's just the way it is.   
  
  Q.  You can take a lot away from today being proud of how you finished.  Great playing, Kevin.   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND:  Thank you, appreciate it.
