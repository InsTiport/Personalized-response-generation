 Q.  Can you please talk about your match. 
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   It was a match where I got off to a fast start, and then he played really well on the back and I just kind of hung on. 
I was starting to wonder if I was going to be able to tie a few holes or maybe win one coming in.  But fortunately enough, I was able to make a few pars and halve a couple of holes.

Q.  What was the turning point, do you think, in your match?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   I really think, you know, I really think there was two.  I made a long eagle putt on 9 to get me 4-up at the turn, and then I was still 4-up playing 13.  And he made about a 10-foot birdie putt and I missed a 4-foot birdie putt. 
Also, the momentum seemed to switch a little bit.  He rolled off another hole and I was 2-up. 

Q.  Did your match against Duval help you in any way for this match in terms of  -- you did play 20 holes, which made you walk a little further, but just knowing that you had played the whole course?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   Yeah, I think so.  I don't have a lot of experience here.  I've only played really one practice round.  So, it was like I got a chance to see the course another time, and so, I think I'm a little more familiar with the golf course now.
