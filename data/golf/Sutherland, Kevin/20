 Q. Score of 69 today. 
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: I played well. I hit the ball really well today. Gave myself a lot of opportunities. I was patient today because for a little while there, they weren't going in. Then all of a sudden, make a birdie on 14, eagle 15, and all of a sudden it came in bunches. It was good. 

 Q. Tell me a little bit about that. You hit 14 of 18 greens. Are you someone who looks at stats, or did you just realize you were grinding it away? 
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: I don't really look at stats too much. I knew I was hitting a lot of greens. I think I missed the last two greens too. Had a nice stretch there through the middle of the round where I put the ball on the green and gave myself a chance at a birdie. 
 A lot of easy pars. Played tough today. Luke Donald played terrific. 8 under par, wow. Great round. I'm not too upset with the way I did. 

 Q. The difference between you and Luke is Luke didn't have any eagles. You had an eagle at 15. Take us through that hole. 
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: I had a good drive. I was playing down out of the right, hit a good drive. Hit a hybrid from like 240 and went about five feet from the hole.
