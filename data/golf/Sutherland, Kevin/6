 Q.  Tell us about the eagle.  
KEVIN SUTHERLAND: You know, I didn't hit a real good shot off the tee, right bunker off the tee, and I hit an 8 iron, and it flew right in.  I hit it really good, and it was right at it and just slam dunked.  No bounce or nothing.  Just flew right in.   
 Q.  What was your number with the 8 iron?  
KEVIN SUTHERLAND: I think it was 161 out of the bunker.  That's stealing.  It was stealing.  No question.   
 Q.  Tell me about the rest of the round then.  I know it's hard out there.  The wind's blowing.  
KEVIN SUTHERLAND: It is.  I'm struggling.  I'm not hitting my irons very good.  I did that yesterday, and it wasn't a lot better today.  So I'm just struggling to get some consistency, you know.  But I've kind of managed my putting pretty well, kind of kept myself in.  Hit a six, seven footer on the last hole for bogey.  I've done a lot of that this week.  Made a lot of up and downs.  I don't know how many greens I hit today, not many.  Luckily, my one good shot just flew right in.   
 Q.  Didn't have to putt.  
KEVIN SUTHERLAND: It did fly right in.  It was a nice thing.  I destroyed the cup.  I guess they had to change the cup.   
 Q.  What do you think about the weather and the start tomorrow?  
KEVIN SUTHERLAND: That's what you have to do.  It doesn't look good.  Have to get it in.  They made the right decision.
