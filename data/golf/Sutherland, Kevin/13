Q.   Do you scoreboard watch when you know where the cut line is and what you need to do to stay under it?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   It's hard to tell.   There's nothing to judge what the cut is going to be out there. 
No, I was kind of guessing.   I thought the cut might be 7 or 8.   And it looks like it's 8.   I had no idea.

Q.   What's the emotions you go through at that point knowing I have no margin for error or a bad shot or secondâ€‘guessing or anything like that?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   You know, I was thinking about it a little bit.   I didn't play the last two holes very well, 8, 9 and 10. 
I made a good par on 10 but it was a struggle.   So you get thinking about it and that's not a good thing, because you start hitting bad shots and that's what I did.

Q.   How do you calm yourself down to say, okay, I need to get this back in the road so I can be here for the weekend?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   Experience.   Obviously I've been on Tour a long time.   So I've been in that position a few times before.   You have to relax and hit good shots, and unfortunately I didn't do that.   But I'm still playing so that's a good thing.

Q.   A short rest is better than the weekend off?
KEVIN SUTHERLAND:   Yes.
