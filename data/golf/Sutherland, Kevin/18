  Q. Can you talk about the eagle and just the round in general? Obviously, a good round today.   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: I played really solid. The eagle on 8, it was a wedge from 130 yards. To be completely honest, I caught it a smidge heavy, and it kind of cuts down so it ran right into the hole.   
 I couldn't see it because there was a big mound in between us and the pin, but it went in.  
  
  Q. Could you tell from the people who cheered?   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: There were tens of people out there cheering for me.   
  
  Q. Well, it's Thursday afternoon.   
 KEVIN SUTHERLAND: Yeah, there were a few people.
