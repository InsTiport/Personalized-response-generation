 Q.  How difficult was it?  You didn't even hit a shot yesterday.  You've been sitting around, went to the movies I suspect or --  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, went to the movies, watched some college football.  Yeah, the conditions were so different than last time I was on the course.  Yeah, just getting my feet under me.  I played six and a half holes, and pick it back up tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did that impact your play?  You hadn't had a bogey and then you had two bogeys.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, I played pretty -- I just hit two poor shots and paid for both of them.  But you know, I played the first two holes nicely and parred the toughest hole on the course there, nice par to finish.  Yeah, a lot of golf to play tomorrow.   
 Q.  Out of the bunker, too?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, almost made it.   
 Q.  You said the other day you guys are used to this kind of stuff.  Do you really get used to it?  It's not the norm.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: No, but it's, what, a third of the tournaments?  It's not like it's once or twice a year.  It's once or twice a month.  Not a big deal.   
 Q.  How different was the course playing?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, very different.  I mean, it's a lot cooler so the ball is going a little shorter.  There's a pretty steady wind.  It was really still, really warm the first two days.  So you know, different.   
 Q.  What about the greens?  Were they a little slower?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: No, they were about the same.  The course is in good shape for how much rain they've had.   
 Q.  Which movie did you see?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: "James Bond."   
 Q.  You said you were going to.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yep.   
 Q.  And your thoughts?  Give us a review.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: It was very predictable Bond, but not nearly as good as the last one, "Skyfall," but very entertaining.   
 Q.  Thoughts on tomorrow?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: You know, just going to kind of be a college day.  Just grab your lunch at the turn and keep going.  If you get on a good run, just ride it as long as you can.
