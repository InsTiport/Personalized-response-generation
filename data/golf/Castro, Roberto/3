 Q.  You're going into tomorrow with two battles on your hands:  You're still in this tournament and you've got that FedExCup scenario as well.  How hard is it going to be not to sort of look at both of those during your round?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: For me it's easy, because I still have a very obvious objective, which is to play really well and try to win the tournament or come close.  So, there's no, not too much scoreboard watching for me.   
 Q.  That's the thing, it's pretty much the same scenario, isn't it, you know you have to be high, three, four, to get it done anyway, so you might as well have a crack at it.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Absolutely.  Yeah, the weather is supposed to be great tomorrow, so hopefully get back to making a bunch of birdies.   
 Q.  You said you don't look at the leaderboard too much, but when it comes down to those last few holes, if you're five back of DJ, but sitting in that fourth spot, will you look and see if you need a birdie?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Probably not.  I mean, really, I played kind of the same way all week and I don't see myself -- even the last two holes, there's no really in between way to play them, you just have to hit really good shots.   
 Q.  It's funny how volatile it is for someone in your situation.  One or two spots can take you in or out.  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, that's why it's fun.  The playoffs is, it's fun for us, because there's just tons of upside.   
 Q.  Does the strategy change a little bit, now that you're six back, to be thinking second or third?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Not really.  Not really.  A really good round puts me back in it.
