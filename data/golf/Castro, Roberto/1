Q. (in progress.)...unfortunately after 29 you kind of ground to a little bit of a halt.  All in all you have to be pleased.  What a terrific round of golf; 7-under?
ROBERTO CASTRO: Thank you.  Yeah, when I added them up it was eight birdies and a bogey, so I was pleased with that.  You know, after Friday I said you know, just never know what you're going to crack 'em loose.  So I did for a stretch and then I didn't for a stretch.
But those last three holes playing kind of back into the wind are tough.  I had to make a couple pars there and I was proud of that.
Q. Yeah.  It seemed to me like you were just barely off the fairways, and that kind of put you a little bit behind the eight ball.  With some of those hole locations, six of the last nine were four off the edges.
ROBERTO CASTRO: Totally.  You nailed it.  You literally of zero control of your ball out of the rough here.  The downwind par-5, like if you hit that fairway you're probably making an easy birdie.
And then a few of those other holes.  Even the bogey I made I hit it right at the flag, but no control of the ball.  That's kind of fall bermuda in the south.  I'm used to that.  But you're 100% right.  Needed to hit it in the short grass couple more times.
Q. You have to be happy though after getting through the Web.com qualifier and back to the PGA TOUR with this finish?  That's got to be very satisfying.
ROBERTO CASTRO: Thanks.  Yeah, it is.  Since we did that wrap-around schedule, the one time I had a good fall I turned it into a good year, so it really does help a lot just to get a little confidence going into the holidays and a few points.  Does help a lot.
Hopefully I got two more starts this fall.  See what I can do.
