Q. You came into the week 53rd, you're projecting 21st.  You had to do the job today, you went out and did work with 67.  Your thoughts?
ROBERTO CASTRO: I was super excited.  I tried to win the tournament and probably got myself a little bit too far back just in the last five holes yesterday with Dustin finishing with four birdies.  But I felt like I got off to a good start today and I kind of kept the pedal down all day.
Q. Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket going home.  You finished ninth in the TOUR Championship before, talk about your thoughts about the TOUR Championship?
ROBERTO CASTRO: I feel like I have the same thing I had this week, I got nothing to lose.  There's 10 million good reasons to play aggressive at home.  So, I'm just -- it's going to be great.  Friends and family there, and I love going back to East Lake.
Q. It's a demanding golf course this Crooked Stick, you really struck the ball well for four days, the work with John Tillery.  Your thoughts on that, please?
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, JT just redneck cliff notes that's how he shortens our lessons.  They seem to work.  It was a lot of progress today from even Charlotte where I was in contention and I left a couple shots out to the right coming in and I kind of, we figured out what caused that and we have been working on it.  So I hit one a little too far left on 17, but at least it wasn't the right shot.
