 Q.  6-under today, obviously a great way to get the tournament started.  What was the key for you out there today?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: I made a couple long putts on the front, which kind of got me going.  Then I played pretty well after that.  So I got settled down, made a couple and then -- but I played a nice round.   
 Q.  Nice little Georgia Tech pairing out there.  What was the camaraderie out there like?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: It was great.  Both of our amateurs were Tech grads, so we had a whole Yellow Jacket foursome.   
 Q.  Got to be a little bit different TOUR atmosphere this week than a normal tournament.  Do you like that kind of feeling?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, this is a great week.  I really enjoy it.  I think that the amateurs are -- have all really interesting backgrounds, and I really enjoy getting to spend some time with them.  It's been, my five years here have been awesome.   
 Q.  Feel like the conversation in between the ropes in the fairways is totally different than another TOUR event?  Do you feed off that?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: It is.  It's interesting.  My partner was in the railroad business for 40 years, so really smart guy, and you can learn a lot.  Like you said, between the views and the good conversation, it gets everybody relaxed.   
 Q.  Where are you playing tomorrow?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: We're at Spyglass.   
 Q.  What the challenges of playing there?  I know it typically plays as the toughest of the courses, what's the challenge?  
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, it's a tougher course, but there's still good scores out there.  So it's a great golf course.
