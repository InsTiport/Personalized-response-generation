Q. Tough final round.  Just your overall thoughts on the day.
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, it was playing really difficult.  Front nine not so much.  I got off to a shaky start.  I had two 3-putts.  I hit the ball fine, but that's costly out here.
The back nine was like a bowling alley.  Really had hard time having any control over your ball.  I hung in there and made a poor bogey on 16.  That's one you can save the day.  Really only one of two good birdie chances on the back and I end up making bogey.
Q. Was it the irons?
ROBERTO CASTRO: No.  I really played fine.  Didn't make as many putts.  Didn't make winning putts today.  Made a couple good ones.  And then 16, you know, a costly hole.
Q. Take me through 16 real quick.
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, just a 3-iron, wedge, and I pulled the 3-iron a little bit.  I had a little tree trouble, so had to hit a little draw around the tree.  It was a yard from a really good shot.  It was a yard short and a yard right and I'm just chipping straight up the hill there.  Probably a 20-foot pitch into the grain.  I just got some grass in between the ball and just kind of fluffed it onto the green.  Almost made a par putt.
Q. Is this survival week?
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah.  I mean, I think to have a good week, but to win any tournament -- you know, I'm sure he did more than just survive.  The guy who wins hits the shots when it matters.
Q. I know you're disappointed with the way you played today, but you've got to be at least happy with where you are position-wise heading into the last event.
ROBERTO CASTRO: Yeah, I'm playing the PGA TOUR next year so that's good.  I'm playing good.  Next week I can go try to win a golf tournament.
But, yeah, it was good.  It's positive step forward.
