 Q. Bogey-free final round, and everybody remembers your start last year and second place finish.  What is it about this golf course you enjoy?ROBERTO CASTRO: I just love this place.  It's like a national treasure.  I love all the holes.  It's really difficult but gives you some birdie opportunities.  I love the feel out here.
Q. Talk about the setup for the final round.  Are there birdie opportunities out there?ROBERTO CASTRO: I think it's going to be tough.  I think the greens -- they were medium to start the day, firm towards the end of our round and these guys have not even teed off yet.  And it's just breezy enough to bake them out as the day goes on.  I don't think you'll see too many birdies.
Q. Any particular holes that are birdie opportunities or tough pars?ROBERTO CASTRO: 10,11, playing tough today.  Tees are back on both.  I hit a 3-iron, 3-iron into those two holes.  But you can make -- 15, 16, you might be able to pick up a couple birdies there.  But after that, just hold on.
