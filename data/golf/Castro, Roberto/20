 Q.   Nice playing today, 2 under.   Is it a case where you just kind of have to tip your hat to Bill?   He shoots 66 on a final round on a tough golf course.   Maybe just some comments.   
ROBERTO CASTRO:   Yeah, exactly.   He didn't make any mistakes, and the birdies on 9 and 10 were big.   I had a chance to kind of keep pace on 11 with about a 6 or 8‑footer on the hardest hole on the course for birdie and just missed it.   That was kind of‑‑  
But I was still in there.   He birdied 14, and I made birdie on top of him.   So I was still in there.   When he hit a gimme on 16, that was a good ‑‑ kind of separated us a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Kind of evaluate the week, if you could, for me.   
ROBERTO CASTRO:   It was a good step forward.   Felt more comfortable in the last group than I did the first time this year.   I felt more comfortable leading after one day.   So it was definitely a step in the right direction.  
   
 Q.   It was a good week.   
ROBERTO CASTRO:   Thank you.
