 Q.   This is home.   How much does that mean to you?  
ROBERTO CASTRO:   A lot.   It's awesome.   I've played East Lake so many times.   Started four or five weeks ago with my caddie and my coach trying to bring it back home, and to have done it is very exciting.   
   
 Q.   Just kind of a couple comments on your year.   You've obviously, especially the last half of the year, played so solid.   Is this kind of like the ultimate payoff?  
ROBERTO CASTRO:   Yeah, I think so.   I think the first half of the year was a little slow.   Played okay but nothing was really going my way.   Kind of halfway through I decided I was going to grind it out until the last shot no matter what, and if I finished 124 on the Money List, I was just going to grind it to the last shot, so to be here 25th in the FedEx is very nice.   
   
 Q.   I'm sure you know that the top 30 also earn an invite to the Masters.   How exciting is that?  
ROBERTO CASTRO:   Yeah, I try not to think about that, and it's a ways down the road.   That's what I told myself; plenty of chances to do it if I don't do it this week.   But it's exciting.   Two tournaments in Georgia, that's bonus for me.  
   
 Q.   How much were you playing attention to the FedExCup numbers?  
ROBERTO CASTRO:   Zero.   Out on the course?   I didn't pay attention at all.  
   
 Q.   How about after each round?  
ROBERTO CASTRO:   No.   I just knew‑‑ I started the whole Playoffs in 40th so I knew if I played well, I would get in the top 30.   I thought it was pretty simple.   And I showed up here in 25th, and I knew I needed to play well to‑‑ so it was kind of‑‑ I was always just looking forward.   I was fortunate I was never in like a place where I just had to hang on.
