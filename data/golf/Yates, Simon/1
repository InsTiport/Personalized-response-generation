 Q.   You started the day one back, shot a 68 and still finished a few shots behind.   That's disappointing but you must be happy with finishing solo third?  
    SIMON YATES:   I'm happy because I struck the ball beautiful today.   I hit 16 greens.   It was a little bit breezier today, and my striking was back to the old days, it was fantastic.   
    Still very nervy, the par 5s, just up beside the greens trying to chip, I need to really work hard on my chipping and my putting has improved a lot from five, six feet.   Yeah, putting is massive in golf.   If you miss ‑‑ you make your 5‑, 6‑footers; only missed a 3‑footer today for bogey at one of the holes.   But otherwise, yeah, really happy with the way it went.  
   
 Q.   You started off with a few birdies to stay in touch with the lead but the middle part of your roundkind of quiet.  
    SIMON YATES:   You've got 9, 10,11, difficult holes.   I was happy to par those.   I hit all the greens but again it's difficult.   You look at from 13 onwards and then you have birdie chances‑‑ well, actually, 12, 13, 14, not 15, 16, 17 is not a birdie chance.   But I hit a great shot in there, as well.   Had about 15 feet for birdie, missed it and at the last I had about 15 feet and thought I had made it but it just stayed out.   Looks like it doesn't matter, I'm third still.   It's pretty good.  
   
 Q.   All in all a great week.   
    SIMON YATES:   Sure.   Still means I can play a little bit of golf.   I was happy with the way I played the last three days.  
   
 Q.   Talk about being here for the first time in Dubai for the new event?  
    SIMON YATES:   It's fantastic.   The weather is great.   The condition of the golf course; just being here is great and I hope more of the top players come next year.
