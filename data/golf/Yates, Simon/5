 SIMON YATES: Yes I just struggled a little bit for some reason today. But my long putting was good because I had a lot of long putts to make two putts. On the sixth hole, the one you can drive, I hit a driver straight through the green into an impossible lie. That is when you are looking to make birdie but at least I didnÃ ¹t drop a shot and had a good two putt to save par in the end. I had a long putt at the seventh for birdie, from 30 feet and then I knocked it on the green in the par five in two. But I am still in the scheme of things overall so I am quite happy. Happy to see Soren drop back a little bit, that brought the rest of us back into it a little bit!

Q. Still coping with the cold weather?
SIMON YATES:  Actually it wasnÃ ¹t too bad today, I took one of my sweaters off. Just down to four now!!
