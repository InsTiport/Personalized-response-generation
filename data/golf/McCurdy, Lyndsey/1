Q. So 75 yesterday, 65 today; what was the difference?
LYNDSEY McCURDY: Just around the greens.  I was hitting the ball pretty good yesterday and then today was probably a little bit better, but I got some putts to fall today.  So it was pretty solid yesterday, I just couldn't get anything to fall.
Q. So were you pretty confident heading into this morning thinking that you kind of left something out there yesterday?
LYNDSEY McCURDY: Yeah, I mean, we talked last night and we kind of just said 75 was probably the worst round I was going to have out here with the way I was hitting the ball.  So we said just go out there and try to shoot a round even par and try to make the cut.  So it's match play from there.  I just wanted to post a good score, and I just kept taking it shot by shot.
Q. You were the quarterfinalist here last year.  So what kind of confidence does that give you heading into match play now?
LYNDSEY McCURDY: Yeah, I'm excited for match play.  I think it's a whole new ballgame.  So I think I play it pretty well.  You've got to think differently and play your shots based on what the other girl's doing.  So I think we're excited for that.  I kind of like that competition.
