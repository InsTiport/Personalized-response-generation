 Q.  Beth, great round out there today:  7-under you finished.  Are you still just plodding away and not trying to get ahead of yourself too much as you said Thursday?  
BETH ALLEN: Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, there are so many birdies out there, so I think it would be kind of foolish to think that that -- I think at the end of the day it's going to be 20-something that's leading.   
I am just trying to make as many birdies as I can and then see where that leaves me.   
 Q.  You played with Brooke Henderson today.  Is it fun having those huge crowds walk around or is it nerve-wracking at all with a lot of eyes watching you?  
BETH ALLEN: I think it's so fun.  A bunch of my friends are here, too, so they were like holding the fort and being really loud for me, so that was awesome.   
I really enjoyed it.  I had so much fun out there.  I hope tomorrow we get some big crowds, too.   
 Q.  Who do you got in attendance this week?  
BETH ALLEN: My mom; childhood friend; I've got my wife; I've got a really good friend from San Diego and two of my friends that live here in Phoenix and then some people I've picked up along the way here, so it's really cool.   
 Q.  And they'll be following you tomorrow?  
BETH ALLEN: Absolutely.   
 Q.  Good luck tomorrow with the round, and we'll see what happens on the 72nd hole.  
BETH ALLEN: Yeah, thank you so much.
