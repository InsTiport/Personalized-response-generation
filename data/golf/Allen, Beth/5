 Q.  Thoughts on the finish?  
BETH ALLEN: I wish I could have done better, but I guess today just wasn't really my day.   
 Q.  How do you look back at the entire season, very successful and cement your position in the top.  
BETH ALLEN: Looking back, I'm so pleased, because this is something that I wasn't ever sure I could achieve.  Everything just sort of went nicely.  So yeah, I'm really, really happy.   
 Q.  So what went wrong?  Was it living up to too many expectations?  
BETH ALLEN: Yeah, I had expectations obviously because I had been playing well all year and I had a decent round in the first round.  But yesterday, something just wasn't right, and then today I thought the conditions were really tough.  Like that score that Shanshan shot is phenomenal, and Charley, as well.   
I guess yesterday was really my downfall and maybe it was just a bit of like I was tired mentally.  Maybe that was part of it.  I don't know.  But I wish it was different.   
 Q.  Coming back to Dubai, if you can reflect on the tournament overall.  Obviously finishing off at the top, but a great course indeed.  
BETH ALLEN: Oh, yeah.  Fantastic course.  I thought it was quite tough this year.  The fairways were soft, so it played quite long.  And then the greens were really fast and firm, so yeah, it was difficult but amazing condition as usual.   
 Q.  You were saying about the Shanshan / money list thing, it doesn't matter now, does it?  
BETH ALLEN: Well, it matters.  I'm gutted.  Of course I wish I would have made more money than her.  But at the end of the day, to be a member, you have to play in six events, and I support the Tour 100 percent.  Because of that, I think I guess I deserve it.   
But yeah, I wish things were different.   
 Q.  It's irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.  
BETH ALLEN: Yeah, I guess it is.  Yeah.
