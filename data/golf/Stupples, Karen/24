  Q. Well played today, talk us through your birdies and bogey?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: The bogey, I just short-sided myself in front of the green there. Didn't quite strike the 6-ron very well so it came up short. Just miss-read the putt. Didn't really get up-and-down.   
 My birdies, they were the par 5s. I got on the green in 9 in two, just a 2-putt, but disappointed to not continue my eagle tally.   
 And then I got a really good up-and-down on 13 for a birdie there, too. On the par 3, I hit a nice little 8-iron to about 15 foot and made that for birdie, very happy with that.   
  
  Q. And how did you find the wind today?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: It was tricky but I thought yesterday's wind was a bit more tricky, I don't know why. I think yesterday was stronger.   
  
  Q. Playing with Chie, we don't know very much about her not being on the LPGA; how did you find her?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: Lovely to play with. Obviously very good golfer. She made a mile of putts today. So that obviously helps your score.   
 But she was very consistent. She had a little shaky start but seemed to pick up. I think once she settled into the round she really got going with it. She holed out for eagle on 6, and I think from that point on, she never looked back.
