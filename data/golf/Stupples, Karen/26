   KAREN STUPPLES: It really kicked off when I holed out for eagle on 3. I kept playing steady, really hit the ball solid.   
 And for some reason I just got on a bit of a bogey chain. You know, I hit not bad shots, but not making any putts. I robbed myself of five or six birdies, and not saying bad putts, but just didn't read them right.  
 Then everything was kind of throwing me off, and then I just never got it back. And I wanted to win. I wasn't making enough birdies to get it back. So putting took a little bit of a hit today. I think I'm going to blame it on that.  
  
  Q. I know you enjoyed playing with Kelly.   
 KAREN STUPPLES: Yeah. She's great. She's a very good player. Obviously she's got a huge future ahead of her. Really enjoyed it. She's a great girl.   
 I felt so bad for her on the last. I mean she had played so solid all the way around, and then just two bad swings. But you know what, two bad swings don't define her as a golfer. So she's just gotta hang in there. And we got another round tomorrow to do and then two more rounds after that. So just got knuckle down and keep playing.  
  
  Q. She seemed like she kept bouncing back as well. Do you think she'll bounce back when she comes tomorrow for sure?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: Absolutely she will. She's got too much it talent not to.
