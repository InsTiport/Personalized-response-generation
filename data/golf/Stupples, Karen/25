  Q. Talk us through the eagles?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: The first one on 13 was good, I hit a really solid drive. It's a bit of a tricky driving hole. I hit a 3-wood, landed over the green and just rolled over the back and chipped in which was kind of nice.   
 And the last one on 9 I hit a perfect drive, only hit 5-iron into the green and made about a 30-foot putt. It was really good, kind of needed it. I had made a few mistakes out there, I had a double-bogey and a few other bogeys. It was nice, one of those rounds where there was plenty of offense, which counteracted the few squirrely shots.   
  
  Q. A lot of players said the pin positions were quite tricky today?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: They were, they were very tough, made you think a lot of the time, which I don't like doing.  
  
  Q. Not very many players under par, with the wind.   
 KAREN STUPPLES: The wind was really -- that made some of the shots tough. I found myself having a lot of shots into the wind off of an upslope and those are hard because you are always trying to keep them down and with the upslope they go up in the air and are very hard how.  
  
  Q. Did you spend Christmas?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: Back in England. I was back in England with the family. We rented a flat in Deal, but we spent most of the time with my parents and sister and her son. We had a really nice family time of it and it was really lovely and we made snow men and played snowballs.   
  
  Q. So you had quite a bit of time off of golf?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: Yeah, it was almost four weeks away from golf.   
  
  Q. Was it snowy all that time?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: It snowed for about two weeks -- it was a week. We were there for two and snowed for a week.  
  
  Q. Did you play in Australia?   
 KAREN STUPPLES: I did, yes.
