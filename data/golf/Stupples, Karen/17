 Q. Karen, is it a surprise to you when you got on the tee there what happened with Cristie? 
 KAREN STUPPLES: It really was. I had an inkling on the putting green that she might not be playing because her caddie came over and said I'm sorry, oh, blah, blah, blah. 
 But I'm gutted for her and I'm gutted for me because I think we would have had a fantastic game. I was ready to play, and if she hadn't been injured, I know she would have given it a good crack, too. But, yeah, gutted, really. But that's how it is.
