  Q. Clearly you were up for this match with Cristie Kerr at the very end here?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: I really was. I had a really great warm-up, and really found a lot of good rhythm on the range this morning. Particularly given the conditions, I was prepared to go out and slog it around, and there was some really tough action out there. I knew Cristie Kerr was going to give it a hundred percent, so I really felt like I had to give it my A game. I felt like I had it.   
 But I feel really bad for her. No one want this is to happen to them and in Solheim Cup, that's for sure. But I would have liked to have played, and I know she would have too. I feel bad for her and for me really. For both of us, it's a shame.  
  
  Q. Yeah, it is very unfortunate circumstance, we appreciate the time, and I guess you can stay dry for the moment. But maybe not, you'll be out there supporting your team?  
 KAREN STUPPLES: I'm going to go out there and cheer the rest of the girls on, yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you have any inkling when you were on the range? Did you see Cristie was in any pain at all?   
 KAREN STUPPLES: No, I saw her down the other end of the range and I saw the coach. He was teeing up the tee balls for her, and she was going through the motions, but it looked like it was a bit of a struggle for her.   
 So I didn't get an inkling that she was ill or anything like that or anything was happening. I just thought it was tough conditions and I thought she was trying to get her head around it. That's all I assumed.
