 Q. Oh, yeah. We said, Who's gonna win? She said, England, 100%. What would you say?
 KAREN STUPPLES: I would say England, but I think I I'll be sitting on the edge of my seat. 
 But I think England will win, yeah. Yeah.

 Q. What do you think the score will be?
 KAREN STUPPLES: Oh, gosh, don't put me on the spot like that. 2-1.

 Q. England?
 KAREN STUPPLES: Yeah.

 Q. All right. 
 KAREN STUPPLES: What did she say? 

 Q. I don't know. She's coming up right now; she's finishing up right now. I just wanted to ask, is the World Cup a big deal for you?
 KAREN STUPPLES: I'm from England. It's huge. (Laughing.) I mean, yeah, it is pretty big. I did notice that in the Springfield paper there was a little piece on the fact that the Scots are kind of rooting for America. 
 So you need to go talk to Catriona Matthew too and see what she says. (Laughing.)

 Q. In England, is the World Cup an equivalent of an American Super Bowl?
 KAREN STUPPLES: I actually think it's probably bigger because it doesn't happen every year. You know, it's one of those things that it's kind of like the Olympics. More like it. It's like the Olympics of soccer. 
 It just is -- I mean, it's just the biggest sporting event in the world. Unfortunately I think the Super Bowl is just American teams, so, you know, it would almost be like the Cup final in the U.K.
 But the World Cup, I mean, that is massive. I don't know what the viewership is around the world, but I would imagine it's pretty huge. 

 Q. Did you ever play?
 KAREN STUPPLES: Soccer? No. Actually, when I was growing up it was kind of regarded as a boy's sport in the U.K. In fact, it probably still is a little bit. 
 I played field hockey. But, you know, didn't stop me from kicking the ball around with the boys at play time. 

 Q. Okay. Thank you.
