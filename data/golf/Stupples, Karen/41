Q.
Talk about today's match.
KAREN STUPPLES:  I think Cristie and Natalie played pretty well.  We couldn't keep up on the front side.  On the back side, we started to come back and really tried to hang in there.  We gave them a pretty good fight in the end.
Q.  Talk about 16 and Cristie coming back with the big shot.  That's just golf?
KAREN STUPPLES:  Absolutely.  That's what you've got to expect from these matches.  We're both very competitive and tough teams, and you're going to find that swinging both ways.
Q.  What do you think about today's results?
KAREN STUPPLES:  It's a good start, and we've just got to keep our heads down and keep coming out tomorrow and Sunday.
