  Q. First match of the Solheim Cup for you. Was it difficult the last three holes?   
 CHRISTEL BOELJON: Yeah, it was. We didn't hit the green so we had to scramble all the way around. But we have a lot of golf left, and hopefully we can get out this afternoon and get a point back.  
  
  Q. What about this partnership with Karen Stupples? Is it a good partnership?  
 CHRISTEL BOELJON: It is, yeah. We like each other a lot. I think we both have a great game, and they have not played that well on the back nine, but that's the way golf is.   
 You can't be 100% every single time. So, yeah, we work well.  
  
  Q. What are you going to do now, get some rest?   
 CHRISTEL BOELJON: Yeah, we've got a few groups coming in still, so I'll be watching them and get ready for the afternoon.   
  
  Q. How do you feel the course played today?   
 KAREN STUPPLES: I thought it played very nicely today. Obviously, the weather conditions were a bit better today, so it played very nicely.  
  
  Q. How do you think that reflects on your own game?   
 KAREN STUPPLES: I didn't play as well today as I played yesterday to be perfectly honest with you. Yesterday I was really firing on all cylinders.  
 That's golf some days. You have good days, you have bad days, and today wasn't as good as yesterday for me. It had nothing to do with the weather or anything, just me.  
  
  Q. (Asking about playing with Christel and her being a rookie?)   
 KAREN STUPPLES: A little bit, but you know what, I'm happy to take that ball and take that putt. It's what it is. If it means that everybody else can see that Europe will win the session and win the point, that's what we're all about. And she's a fantastic player, who wouldn't mind player with her anyway, so...
