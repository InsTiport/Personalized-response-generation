 Q.  How was the course playing? 
 JOHN KELLY:  Had a good time.  First two holes a little nervous.  Didn't say my prayers last night around Amen Corner.  Was a little nervous with first shot. 
 3-putted first two holes.  Can happen when you have the jitters. 
 Played well in the second half of the front.  9, 10, 11, 12, missed some short ones.  Played with Crenshaw.  They were telling me to relax.  They were great. 

 Q.  Condition of the greens. 
 JOHN KELLY:  Mr. Crenshaw kept telling me to hit it high and soft.  I played with him in practice.  He's right.  On front, got excited, was playing well.  Maybe I got too excited. 
 It was what I expected.  It was more than that. 

 Q.  How was the Crow's Nest? 
 JOHN KELLY:  I was the only man left standing.  Glad to be a small part of history.  No trouble sleeping. 
 My prayers were to, "Trust in your abilities and have a blast."  I have a note in my pocket that says, "Breathe, have fun and play my game."  (Wrote himself.) 
In no means am I a world beater.  It's great to play with the world's best.
