 Q.  Talking about his round. 

 JOHN KELLY:  It was awesome the whole experience.  I didn't play all that bad.  It was like Deja Vu again on the back nine.  I was even par on the front and then 11 and 12 kicked my butt.  I thought if I could string together some good holes on the rest of the back nine I still had a chance to make the cut. 

 I appreciate the support and the crowd was gracious.  Right now it hurts, but an hour from now it will be pretty cool to look back on.
