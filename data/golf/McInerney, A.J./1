 Q.  Just one quick comment about finishing top 10, and what that means to you?  
A.J. McINERNEY: I mean, this whole week has exceeded my expectations.  To finish top 10 is just icing on the cake for me.  We're going to go have fun and celebrate with my friends and family, and thank you very much to the Las Vegas crowd and everyone that came out and supported Vegas Strong.  It was absolutely incredible.
