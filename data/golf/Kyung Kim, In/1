Q. In Kyung Kim, who finished up you with three birdies in her last four holes.  What got you down the stretch?

Q. Since we last saw you on the LPGA Tour you tried out for the U.S. Open on the men's tour.
Was it 7200 yards?  What lessons did you learn from that coming to Hazeltine National that's 6800 this week?
A
Well, that was awhile ago, even it's totally different from playing in the desert and here.  I've grown up watching PGA Championship held here and I'm just honored to be here and it's amazing to play the same course that players I look up to.  Even though it's tough day, I wouldn't be anywhere else.
Q. How does it feel to take in the history of this golf course as you're playing it?
A
The clubhouse, you walk in there and see all those faces.  Wow, it's pretty awesome.  But it's great we get to play here and I think yeah, hopefully the rain stops.
Q. With the time off that you took, what expectations did you have for yourself coming into this?
A
Little lower, for sure.  I mean I have a new caddy and my coach and I've done everything I could to be healthy and yeah, it's really good to be out here and I feel good.
