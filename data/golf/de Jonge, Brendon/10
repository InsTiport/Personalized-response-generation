Q.   It was a lot of fun to watch you early, 5‑under through the first four holes, didn't quite keep that momentum going, but still, a great number.   Are you satisfied with your performance? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Very much.   I didn't know what to expect today to be honest.   Jet‑lag has not been great so far but yeah, I'm very, very pleased with the end result. 

Q.   What did you think you did so well out there today?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I made a lot of putts.   To be honest I didn't hit the ball that great but I bailed myself out a few times. 

Q.   You're known traditionally as a guy when you get on a streak, you just keep going.   Is this a golf course that suits your style of game?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I like this golf course.   I played it yesterday for the first time and it's one of those courses that's a bunch of fun to play and I'm very glad that I came over here and played it.

Q.   You spend most of your time on the PGA Tour, and this is the first European Tour event you've played outside of the majors and WGCs.   How did you decide to come and play here? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I remember watching a little bit of this on TV last year and the golf course looked like fun, and guys that I spoke to said they do an outstanding job here with the tournament.   I haven't been let down.
