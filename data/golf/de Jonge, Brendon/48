  Q. A solid 66 here in the first round. Great playing. A good up and down on the last hole to save that round, too?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah. (Indiscernible.)   
  
  Q. Did that just miss the club face?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah. (Indiscernible.)   
  
  Q. Tell me what you're doing good. What's the best part of your game right now?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: You know, it was solid. Pretty much all around solid play. I made a couple key putts early, which was nice.  
  
  Q. How were the greens rolling in the afternoon?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Um, it was still pretty good. Still pretty firm. They're rolling pretty good.  
  
  Q. To be as new as they are, everybody seems impressed.   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, you can see they're new greens, but they've got a good surface.  
  
  Q. You're a big fisherman, I know that. I saw you looking in those streams throughout the day. Were you doing a little trout scouting?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, when I started sweating over there a little bit I (indiscernible) in the water. Yeah, we saw a couple nice ones down there.   
 Yeah, I was, like I said, pretty solid all round. Made a couple key putts early on, which was nice, a nice way to get the round going.   
  
  Q. As hot as you were last year, how does it feel to come back basically just as hot and you shoot a 66?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it's nice to get off to a good start, nice to come back to a place where you have a lot of good memories and a lot of good crowd support.   
 So it's been good.  
  
  Q. T3 last year. Do you think you can do better this year?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: I would like to, but we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. You got started really hot and then just faded a way. Is it because the greens got firmer as the round went on?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Ah, no, I wouldn't say the greens got firmer. I think that back nine is a little bit tougher, so I'll take even par back there.   
  
  Q. Can you talk to me a little bit about the greens and what shape they're in.   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, no, they're in great shape. They're obviously very, very firm still being as new as they are. So it's difficult to put the ball close to the hole and there are a couple tough pins out there.  
  
  Q. How different is it playing this year versus last year?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: It's night and day. Last year was all target golf. The greens were really soft and we could take aim.   
 This year you got to think your way around a little bit.  
  
  Q. You like this better this way?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, definitely as far as a challenge it's definitely much better.
