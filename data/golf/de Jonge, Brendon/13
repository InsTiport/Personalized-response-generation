 Q.   Talk about your round, six birdies and one bogey.   
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, obviously very pleased.   I drove the ball nicely out there today, which is the key to this golf course.   You are going to have a couple birdie chances, but that was definitely the key to the round.  
   
 Q.   Seems like it's hack‑out rough.   
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It is, that rough is very, very thick.   Every now and then you'll get lucky and draw a lie where you can get it up and around the green, but for the most part you're going to be wedging it out.  
   
 Q.   Do you like these type of old‑style courses we play sometimes?  
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I do, very much.   So I have always liked the traditional‑style golf scores with big trees, more sort of parkland could have courses.   That's what I grew up playing as well.  
   
 Q.   The 5‑under start, and you get to play in the morning; how important is that to turn around real quick?  
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It is nice.   Hopefully you can carry on with the momentum.   I've heard the weather might be a little bit iffy tomorrow morning, so we'll see, we'll deal with that.
