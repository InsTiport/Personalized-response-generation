Q.   Give me a few thoughts about your round.   You made 7 birdies out there, I believe.
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I played nicely today.   I got a new putter in today and actually worked.   So that was nice.

Q.   You know, right now you're in the Top-10.   Talk about your year thus far and if today shows signs of getting a little better?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah.   It's been very consistent.   I just haven't putted well enough this year to really have contended.   You know, I've hit the ball nicely all year, driven it really good.   As I say, just haven't made enough putts.

Q.   So you switched to -- what did you go to as far as a putter?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I pulled one out of my closet I used ten years ago.   I putted the ball nicely today.

Q.   Any highlights to the day?   Any long putts that got you going?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, I didn't make anything long.   I just made all the ones I was supposed to.
