 Q. Talk just about the final round today. 
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah, it was fun. It was exciting. Obviously would have been nice to make that last one or a couple more coming in, but, no, it was fun.

 Q. You said the front nine was a tougher half of the course for you, and you played that real well this afternoon. 
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah, I didn't get off to a great start obviously bogeying the first, but made a couple birdies around the turn which got me back in the tournament and gave me a chance on that back nine. 
 Just didn't make any putts when I needed to.

 Q. You guys have been talking about earlier in the week the greens were kind of hard. With this rain, has that helped you guys out any?
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah, they softened up a little bit, I think. The golf course felt like it was a little bit softer today than it had been and easier to get the ball closer to the hole.

 Q. Disappointing finish I know, but you're still playing some pretty consistent golf here lately. 
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah. Yeah, I have. I've been playing nicely for the last month. 
 Would've been really nice to make a couple more coming in, though. 

 Q. Talk about the last putt. We couldn't see it from back here. 
 BRENDON de JONGE: No, you know, I had actually a terrible putt. I had it straight up the hill from four feet and barely touched the hole and just had a bad putt.

 Q. In contention two years in a row. Pretty comfortable with all the Hokie fans around and all that? 
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah, I like the golf course and I love the crowd support. It's fun. Nice place to play.
