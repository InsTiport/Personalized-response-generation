  Q. How do you feel heading into the next couple tournaments you're going to play?  
 BRENDON de JONGE: Obviously I'm getting very comfortable out here. I feel confident with the way my game is at the moment.   
 Things are definitely trending in right direction. It's been a lot of fun.   
  
  Q. Was it just kind of put up as low as you can and hope for the best?  
 BRENDON de JONGE: Yeah, we figured at the beginning of the week just make a lot birdies. Nothing changed. It was exactly what we expected. Should be a good finish.   
  
  Q. Just talk a little bit about your round today.   
 BRENDON de JONGE: You know, I hit the ball nicely all week and made a lot chances for myself. Would have liked to have made a couple more, but everyone does.
