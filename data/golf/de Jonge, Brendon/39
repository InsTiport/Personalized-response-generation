  NELSON SILVERIO:   Let's welcome our 54‑hole leader at the AT&T National Brendon de Jonge.   Sort of unusual circumstances.   Just take us through the day and your thoughts on the round. 
BRENDON De JONGE:   Yeah, it was actually really strange out there, took a little while to get used to.   It's nice to have people out there and get the buzz and kind of feed off adrenaline.   Obviously we didn't have that today.   But in saying that, I'm obviously very happy with my round and position going into tomorrow. 

Q.   Did you in any way feel kind of cheated of the experience of leading after 54 holes, like the roar coming down 18 or anything like that?
BRENDON De JONGE:   No.   I mean, it's‑‑ by then we had kind of got used to it.   At first it was definitely very strange, but no, I wouldn't say cheated. 

Q.   Just curious, the birdie on 12, what club was that out of the left rough, and how do you play that shot to get the right pace up the slope?
BRENDON De JONGE:   Actually I got really lucky.   I had a good lie in the rough.   It was just a wedge, and landed a nice number and obviously rolled up there nicely. 

Q.   Was it easier or harder to play in those conditions, and sort of what was the strangest aspect of it for you?
BRENDON De JONGE:   As I said, just the‑‑ no buzz, and it was hard to get the adrenaline going, kind of felt like you were playing a Tuesday practice round or a qualifier.   But I obviously understand why they had to do it.   But it was definitely a little bit different.   Maybe a little bit tougher just because it's not what we're used to. 

Q.   With all the rain we got last night, did you feel maybe coming in you'd be able to shoot a low score on this course, the greens would be a little bit more receptive?
BRENDON De JONGE:   Yeah, the golf course was definitely a little bit softer.   They set it up a little bit easier for you, as well.   They had a bunch of tees forward obviously trying to get us through today.   But yeah, I would say this is definitely the easiest we've played the course for the first three rounds.

Q.   What was the fewest people you've played in front of before today?
BRENDON De JONGE:   One probably. 

Q.   Did you have more than one today?
BRENDON De JONGE:   I think we had three today, yep.   Maybe four for a couple holes, but then he left us, as well. 

Q.   To win on TOUR, what would it mean to you to come in here and put that on your resumÃ©?
BRENDON De JONGE:   It would be huge.   Winning here would be that much more special, as well, obviously being a huge Virginia Tech contingent around here would be wonderful, and it's obviously a great tournament with a great field, so that would be a good feather in your cap.   But obviously I've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

Q.   Where did you make your two birdies on the front?
BRENDON De JONGE:   2 and 6.

Q.   What did you do?
BRENDON De JONGE:   I hit a 3‑iron to about three feet on No.   2 and two‑putted No.6, the par‑5.

Q.   Is there something about this time of year, as well?   You play well at the Greenbrier, as well. 
BRENDON De JONGE:   No, I don't know if it's anything about this time of year.   Just happen to have played well around the same time.
