 Q.   It's been quite the month for you, Presidents Cup, looks good for TOUR Championship, and as a result first Masters.   Just comments on the actions the past month or so for you.   
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah, it's been very exciting.   Obviously I've played nicely in the Playoffs.   I've played consistently in these Playoffs, and the highlight was getting named to the Presidents Cup team for sure.   But yeah, if things stay as they are, playing in April will be good fun, too.  
   
 Q.   How about the week here, obviously a lot of starting and stopping, but just kind of stayed the course so to speak.   
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah, I did.   I played nicely the last two rounds, really, really clean.   Unfortunately I had a threeâ€‘putt on 16, but other than that I played really clean.   It was nice.   I felt pretty calm out there, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   What do you do now, kind of obviously as Tom said you're kind of at the mercy of what they do out there.   Is it a fulfilling year?   Obviously as you mentioned the Presidents Cup, with or without the TOUR Championship?   Obviously I know you'd like to be there, though.   
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah, it would still be a very fulfilling year.   Obviously I'm in the position right now if I didn't make it I'd be very disappointed.   But yeah, it's been a fulfilling year.   I had a lot of goals starting out the year, and I've accomplished all of those if I do make it to Atlanta, which is always a nice thing.
