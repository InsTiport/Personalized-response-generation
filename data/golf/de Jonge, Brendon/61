 Q. Can you talk about the atmosphere?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: It was fun. It was great, he's a super nice guy and hell of a player obviously.

 Q. Talk about his game. 
 BRENDON DE JONGE: 17 year old, he's very, very talented. It was fun to watch. He's very mature on the golf course. As good of a player as he is, he's a nicer guy.

 Q. The atmosphere didn't bother you too much?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: No. Obviously any time you get more people out there watching, it's great. It's great for the TOUR and it's great for the game. It was a lot of fun.
