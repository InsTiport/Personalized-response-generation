Q. Very huge putt on that final green, what a clutch eightâ€‘footer you rolled in. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, it was obviously nice.   I played terribly all day, so to get one on the last hole was nice.   Obviously it makes some difference.

Q.   How much was BMW on your mind during this final round?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   A little bit, but I was struggling so much with my own golf game that I had other things going on.

Q.   You can't try harder than 100 percent.   You give that all the time on the golf course.   Still, standing over that wedge into the 18th green you had to have a lot of thoughts in your mind. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, obviously I knew a birdie was going to help, but it was all out of my hands out.   So I'll wait and see and watch it.
