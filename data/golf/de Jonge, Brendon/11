Q.   Just file away and you remember it the next time you're in contention; right?
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah.   Very much so.   Very much so.   It was nice to play a strong last round to obviously get a chance to win the tournament.

Q.   The final putt, I mean the approach‑‑ the first putt, on 18 in the playoff, did that look pretty good from where you were standing?
BRENDON de JONGE:   No, I knew that didn't have a chance.   The one on 17 I thought had a better chance, definitely. 

Q.   You can't really look back over the last nine and what‑if yourself too much?
BRENDON de JONGE:   No, not really.   You know.

Q.   Got beat by a good shot on 17?
BRENDON de JONGE:   Very much so, yeah.   I didn't birdie the par‑5 in regulation.   I had a very easy bunker shot, but other than that, I didn't leave much out there.

Q.   Do you have any relationship at all with nick price?
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah.   Very good relationship.

Q.   What's he been to you?
BRENDON de JONGE:   Really good friend of mine.   Mentor.   We talk on a weekly basis.   I normally stay with him down at the Honda.

Q.   Do you all go on the same plane together?
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah.

Q.   You played well. 
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yeah.   No, definitely.

Q.   What do you do when that shot's in the air, Robert's?
BRENDON de JONGE:   What can you do?   No, I mean he hit a great shot, and as I said, it's nice for him to have a birdie.   It's a good way to win the tournament.

Q.   This was your first playoff. 
BRENDON de JONGE:   Yes.
