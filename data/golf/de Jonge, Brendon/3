 Q.  Talk about the round today and what was going well for you.  
BRENDON DE JONGE: I played solid.  Hit it in a lot of fairways.  You kind of have to when you're playing ball-up and the course is this soft.   
I hit good off the tee and got pretty lucky.  Didn't get much wind until we made the turn.   
I was able to take advantage of that early.   
 Q.  The Plantation course is new to the tour.  Initial thoughts?  Obviously you liked it.  
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it's good.  It's a fun golf course to play.  Obviously resort golf course.  It's nice.  It's a nice mix from Sea Side to Plantation.  It's good.  I'm plaid glad they incorporated it.   
 Q.  Can you contrast the Sea Side and Plantation course?  I know you played 20 rounds over there and 1 over here.  
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, obviously completely different.  This is a lot more parkland.  But the greens are very, very small over here.  I think from what I've heard we're going to get some wind on Sea Side, so going to be tricky out there.   
 Q.  Last thing, 4-under on the four par-5s.  Is there a different kind of game plan compared to other courses for these Par-5s?  
BRENDON DE JONGE: Obviously we've got four on this one and I need two over there.  Got to try and get them on the Plantation side for sure.
