 Q.  1-under 71, obviously tough conditions as evidenced by you going into the weekend with a 7-under lead.  You're right there.  You've got to be feeling good about it?  
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, I'm in the position where I need to play well to try and keep my card for next year.  But yeah, it's been two solid days.   
 Q.  Obviously conditions dry; we heard earlier the rules guys are doing as best they can with some of the pin positions, giving you guys a chance to run it up.  Is the course holding up okay for you?  
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it is.  If you don't hit it in the fairway, you've got no chance.  And they did; they set it up fairly, and it's just kind of some places, you've got no option but to fly it up there.  It's really, really difficult.  And then add the breeze to it, and it gets that much harder.   
 Q.  Has the wind been consistent or is it more swirling?  
BRENDON DE JONGE: It's consistent when you get up here.  When you get down in the valley, you've got absolutely no idea.  It's kind of all over the place, and I'm sure they are showing some big scores down there.
