Q. Was that about as tough as you've seen out there today?BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it did, it got tricky.  It was what we expected, though.  We knew the golf course was going to be difficult this weekend and we got exactly what we expected.
Q. Nine of the pins were about as tough as they can probably even put them, your thoughts on the pin placements?BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, without a doubt.  There were a couple flags where you look at it -- it was easier to putt it off the green than it was to keep it on in a couple of places.  It's what we expected.  And I think tomorrow is going to be more of the same.
Q. What sort of mindset are you in going into tomorrow?BRENDON DE JONGE: You know, it's going to be more of the same, try and stay patient.  Obviously I got myself in a very good position today with 7, 8 holes to go, and made kind of a mess coming in.  But as soon as you start chasing it on a golf course like this, you're in trouble.
Q. Did you feel today like you were chasing a number, were you looking at Martin's score?BRENDON DE JONGE: No, unfortunately I made a couple of bad swings at the wrong time.  And obviously in a set up like this you pay for it.
