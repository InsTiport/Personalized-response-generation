Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It's been great.   I think we have got a lot of common interests.   We had a good dinner last night, a lot of fun for all of us to get together and get to know each other a little bit better.   It's been great.   The comradery has been awesome. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I think it definitely could be.   Obviously those guys that have played a bunch of these, there is going to be a little bit of scar tissue.   As you say, seven rookies, we haven't experienced the defeat yet. 
It could definitely be a benefit in that regard, in saying that we are definitely looking to Ernie, Adam and all for help and assistance to get through all of this.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, yeah.   I think the majority of us have played here four, five, six times.   From that standpoint, there is not that much of advantage.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, I'm happy with whoever I play with.   I get on great with all the guys.   I would love to play with anybody.   Obviously 11 great players, and it would be fun to play with anyone.

Q.   As far as match play experience, when was the last time you had experience? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Couldn't even tell you, to be honest.   It's been a long, long time.

Q.   Back to amateur days?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   For sure, yeah, back to amateur days.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   We've all been picking Ernie's brain for a little bit of advice.   He's won the world match play however many times, six or seven times.   Just asked him simple questions, nothing unexpected, the answers we've been getting.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   To be honest, there weren't that many people out there today surprisingly.   I think the golf fans sort of know who we are.   But as I said, there weren't that many crowds out there today.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Probably so. 

Q.   Do you feel like a rookie? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, I don't, to be honest.   I feel comfortable out here, comfortable around these guys.   I wouldn't say I feel established by any means, but I do feel pretty comfortable. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   You know, I'd say probably Ernie, Adam, guys that have been through this before that have played in a couple of these Cups have definitely been the most outspoken.   In saying that, everyone has been encouraged to speak up and voice any of their opinions.   I think that's good.   It's been great for team comradery as well.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   You know, just get after it, have fun, enjoy it and make things happen.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, we didn't today.   Our whole group hit it from the back tee and laid it up.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I think it will definitely be reachable for a bunch of guys.   I think it will fun for match play.   Make it a great match play hole.

Q.   How is Nick as a captain? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   He's been great.   You know, he's been very forthcoming with advice.   He's been very easy to get hold of.   He's going to be a wonderful player as captain.   He is encouraging us to voice any of our opinions.   It's been nice. 
Everything we're doing as a team, there's not so many organized dinners this year.   I've heard from other guys that there's been a lot of that.   We've had long three or four dinners, and we had a lot less of that this year. 
He's been great, easy to deal with.   He's an easy guy to be around.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Easy going with a very competitive undertone probably be the best way to put it.   We all want to win.   Nick wants to win very, very badly as a captain. 
He keeps telling us how exciting it was in '98, I think, when they won.   Obviously he wants all of us to experience that feeling. 

Q.   You made more birdies than just about anybody.   Does that help? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I think so, yes.   It would definitely be good and good in the four ball.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I feel like I'm pretty streaky.   I feel like I can make birdie in bunches at times.   As you say, playing a lot of tournament rounds helps too.

Q.   Were you surprised to feel as comfortable as you did when you got here? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   You know, I was nervous but excited, which is probably a pretty natural feeling.   As I say, I feel comfortable on the first tee today.   Come Thursday it will be a different feeling.   As I say, right now I feel very comfortable.

Q.   Did anything surprise you?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, not really.   Not really.   I anticipated that it would be a lot of comradery in the locker room, a lot of guys ribbing each other.   It's been exactly what I thought. 

Q.   What is it like coming back to Murfield Village? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It does, yeah.   There's obviously a little bit more corporate hospitality than we're used to, a few more electronic scoreboards than I'm sure Mr. Nicklaus would like on the golf course.   It definitely has a little different look to it, but it's still the same golf course.
