Q.   Make a lot of birdies, you always do and you found some out on the golf course this afternoon.
BRENDON DEJONGE:   Yeah.   Unfortunately, I left a lot out there.   If I putted decently it would have been a really good round.   Never complain with 4-under.

Q.   It appeared to me that the wind was down and the greens were receptive, it was there to have a really good number.
BRENDON DEJONGE:   Very much so.   Once -- as soon as this cloud cover came over the wind completely died and the greens were receptive.   The golf course was pretty soft.

Q.   Still you got to mind your way around this golf course because it can bite you even though the conditions were good for scoring.
BRENDON DEJONGE:   Very much so.   It's definitely a position off the tee golf course.   You got to drive it well.   I've got to give myself a lot of chances.
