  Q. Lot of people in the hunt going into tomorrow. You're 8 under, and the leader is 11 right now. So if you put a good round together, anything can happen?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it's going to be key to get off to a good start tomorrow. I'm 3 behind right now, and who knows by the end of the day. But getting off to a good start will be key.  
  
  Q. Talk about your round today and overall this week so far?   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: I hit it the best today that I have over three rounds. I putted really nicely the first three rounds. Today I hit it where I was hoping for the most part and made a couple.   
  
  Q. As far as this golf course, how does it suit your game? Pretty well so far?   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, I like the way this golf course sets up. I like the shapes off the tee. You've got to hit a variety of clubs out here. It actually makes you think a little bit.  
  
  Q. Have you hit a lot of irons off the tee? A lot of strategies?   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, there is. You've got to hit it in certain spots to the widest part of the fairway.   
 As I said, you have to hit a variety of shots.  
  
  Q. A lot of things would have to go right tomorrow, but what would it mean to you?   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: It would be huge. Winning any tournament regardless of anything else, it means the world to me. So I'll give it a good go tomorrow.
