Q.   Talk about the 24 putts. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I'm going to have to hit it a little bit better coming up if I want to contend, but I putted really nicely today.

Q.   You got away with a few wayward drives but you were able to keep it in play. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, it's such a difficult golf course.   My misses were in the right place for the most part, and I just had to scramble.

Q.   Have you putted well all year?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   No, not at all.   I've struggled with the putter all year, and it was nice to see a few go in.

Q.   You've been very consistent, made a lot of cuts this year?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I have, yeah.   Unfortunately if the putter behaved a little bit earlier in the year, I might have been up there a few more times.
