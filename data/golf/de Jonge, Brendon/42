Q.   10‑under par, on the last hole you're probably thinking about it a little bit; pretty easy put up the hill? 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It was.   That was about as easy as it got.   But I got a lot out of my round today.   I didn't play very well to be honest and to actually shoot 3‑under, I think I stole that.

Q.   And that's what it takes on the PGA TOUR; you got it in the house, 3‑under par on a tough course, that might bode well going into Sunday. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I hope so.   I'm going to have to play a lot better.   I don't think I'm going to be able to scrape it around like I did today, tomorrow.   But it's nice to play badly and put a score on it.
