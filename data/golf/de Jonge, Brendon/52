  Q. Just talk about the overall round, any highlights today or just smooth all the way around?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Played pretty good for the most part. I had a rough patch on the front side there, made a couple putts to keep it going, and then obviously played well on the back nine.   
  
  Q. Conditions similar, obviously not much wind and a lot of good scores now.   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, obviously there's very little wind. Especially for out here, which makes it easy, because it does start swirling when it blows a little bit.   
 Yeah, I would imagine there's going to be some good scores. The greens are still pretty soft.  
  
  Q. Talk about your year to this point a little bit. Starting to play a little better?   
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it's been consistent so far. I've had a lot of Top-25s having had that really good week yet, but it's been pretty steady.   
  
  Q. Anything in this round stood out, any good save or long putt made?  
 BRENDON DE JONGE: No, I putted pretty well all day. Nothing that really jumps out.
