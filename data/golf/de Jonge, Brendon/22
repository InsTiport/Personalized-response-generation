Q.   Who knows, but at the end of the day, it has to be an emotional lift and an extra half point in order to make that; what a clutch 5â€‘footer. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, you know, I mean, if I made more of those, we would have had a better record.   This man played unbelievable for the last three days or so, and it was a real pleasure playing with Brendon.   But it was very satisfying to make that putt.   Just to win the match, because we played good golf. 

Q.   It always seems hardest to get that last hole to secure the match, like you get to the ninth inning of a baseball game; really clutch chip for you. 
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Luckily we are playing preferred lies and I could take it over there where there was a bit of a question under it and that made the shot a lot easier.   But like Ernie said, an absolute pleasure playing with him the last two days and he's played great golf, as well.   It's been a lot of fun.
