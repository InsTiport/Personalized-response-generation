Q.   Anytime you can cruise around here and play under‑par golf, 4‑under today,‑7, just tell us about your round, your strengths and how did it go?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I played nicely today.   I hit a lot of good shots.   I drove the ball well, which is obviously a key around here.   Like you say, anytime you can go around here bogey‑free it's nice.

Q.   I thought you had a good look at 15 for birdie.   In fact, the last few holes you had a really good luck, they just wouldn't fall?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I had three really good looks coming in.   But I made a couple as well, so it all evened out.

Q.   How about the conditions out there?   They had a lot of rain overnight, was it what you expected?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, it was.   Obviously the golf course was a lot softer and played a little bit longer.   But coming into the greens that made it a little easier.   I thought we caught a pretty good break today.   We didn't get the winds we were supposed to.   I think that's coming tomorrow.

Q.   I was going to say, tomorrow may be gusts up to 35 miles an hour.   I think this is your fifth time playing in this tournament, how tough will it be out there?
BRENDON DE JONGE:   It's going to be difficult.   Obviously blowing that hard then it gets in the trees and swirls around, as well.   It's going to be difficult.   It's going to be a day to stay patient.
