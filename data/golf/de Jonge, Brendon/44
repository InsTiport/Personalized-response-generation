  BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it was nice. Obviously we had the best of the conditions, very, very still this morning, first group off, and greens are absolutely perfect. 

 Q. How do you approach -- you can see some scores just going off the charts the other way, do you play conservative or carefully or how?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Conservatively aggressive I guess. I drove it in a lot of fairways today, so that obviously made the golf course a lot easier that way. 

 Q. Pretty much home-town type weather being from Charlotte?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, last couple of weeks in Charlotte have been very similar to this so I knew what to expect.

 Q. The course played the way you expected? 
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, the greens were very receptive, very receptive this morning. They started drying out a little towards the ends there and a little bit of breeze picked up. 

 Q. Any issues on 14 and 17? 15 and 17?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: No, I made two solid threes. I hit 3-iron just short. They were kind to us on 17. They played that quite a bit up. 

 Q. Do you feel good about your game right now?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, played nicely the last couple months, so definitely trending in the right direction. 

 Q. Were you guys a little -- was there a problem out there?
 BRENDON DE JONGE: We waited on 12 for quite a while. And pretty much waited every shot the back nine. We had a little delay on 12.
