 Q. What made the day more difficult for you?
 BRENDON de JONGE: I couldn't get the wind right, and I hit a couple bad shots in the wrong time and got a couple bad breaks. 

 Q. But you hung in there on the back nine and got a couple back. Talk about that.
 BRENDON de JONGE: I did. It's nice. It gives me a bit of an outside shot tomorrow. Would have been nice if I was to get that one on the last hole. 
 But, yeah... (indiscernible).

 Q. Just five shots off. 
 BRENDON de JONGE: I'll have to get off to a really good start to make a run at it. But, yeah, sure.
