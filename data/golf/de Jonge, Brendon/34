 Q.   Brendon, you came up one short.   You shoot a tournament record, tying tournament record, and can't get it done.   You played solid all week.   
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, I did.   I played nicely all week.   Hat's off to Ryan; he played great, especially down the stretch.  
Couple tough shots in there 17 and 18 and he pulled them off when he needed to.  
   
 Q.   You had a good one at 17.   All week long, one shot back.   The tee ball at 16 maybe to give you the opportunity?   
BRENDON DE JONGE:   Yeah, very much so.   Today playing a little bit down breeze, all got to do is get one in the fairway.   It's almost a mid‑iron in there, so that was definitely a turning point, you know, the bad tee shot there.   
   
 Q.   You're such a good ball‑striker.   When you go through 72 holes of golf and you're only asking for one shot back, that's pretty darn good playing.   You hit it well tee to green.   The putter didn't really let you down, but you had so many opportunities.   
BRENDON DE JONGE:   I did.   It felt like I putted from 10, 12 feet all week really.   Obviously the first round I made my share, and then kind of cooled off a little bit after that.   
It's golf.
