Q. Nicholas Lindheim, who had a chance at history.  You were 9-under through 15 yesterday when play was suspended.  What was that like to sleep on that?  Did you get much sleep last night to think about it?
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: I don't think I got much sleep because it took forever to get out of here and I didn't get to bed until 11.  My fire alarm went off at 5 this morning.  Probably the best day for the fire alarm to go off that early.  It was a good day yesterday.
Q. What was it like to go out there then today and try to tackle that 59 feat?
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: I wasn't really thinking about that.  I wanted to hit good shots.  I ended up making a couple bad swings but salvaged a couple pars.  Pretty pleased with the round.  Hopefully I can do it again this afternoon.
Q. Now you got yourself in contention heading into the final round.  Thanks for your time.
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: My pleasure.
