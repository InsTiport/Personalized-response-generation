Q. Nick, what a super round today:  5-under, birdied three of the last four holes.  Talk a little bit about the day and if the conditions affected you at all.
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: Well, living in Florida we get a lot of wind, so as long as it's warm I'm okay.  I guess the forecast is supposed to be a little cooler over the weekend, so just have to make due with that.
Chipped and putted the ball good; scrambled.  I scrambled when I was out of position.  Just got to drive it a little bit better and I think things will fall into place.
Q. How do you feel about going into the weekend?  Right now you're in a super position.
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: Yeah, I've been there before.  Just got to go out and execute the shots and play to my best ability.
Q. I think you had a pretty good tournament last year here, didn't you?  T-25 or so?
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: Yeah, I finished -- it was probably like my best finish of the year, I think.
Q. Yeah.  Is this just a course that kind of suits your game?
NICHOLAS LINDHEIM: Bermuda.  It's got some space off the tee, which I've kind of needed this week so far.
Yeah, the greens are all bermuda.  I play on bermuda, so it's just comfortable.
