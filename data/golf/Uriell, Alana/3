Q. Bank of Hope Founders Cup round one with Alana Uriell.  Great playing today.  7-under par.  What was working well for you?
ALANA URIELL: I felt really confident with my ball striking, and then once I hit it close I was making a lot of putts.
Q. You won a few weeks ago your first professional start on this the Symetra Tour.  How has that win motivated you so far?
ALANA URIELL: I think it's given me a lot of confidence coming into the LPGA having a win under my belt.  Feel a little more at home out here so I don't mine letting loose and seeing what I'm capable of.
Q. What makes this event special with some of the Founders here this week and there are members of Girl's Golf.
ALANA URIELL: I mean, the Founders are just amazing women that I really have looked up to for a long time.  To have them all here watching all of us play is such an honor.  Really great to be able to pick their brain and see what their experiences are.
Q. We launched the new DriveOn campaign this week.  What are your thoughts on that and seeing the This is For Every Girl film shared on social media?
ALANA URIELL: I think the DriveOn campaign is a really good step in the right direction.  I mean, inspiring young girls is kind of like what we're all about here.  Then, yeah, just focusing on like what we've had and how we can grow is a really great thing.
