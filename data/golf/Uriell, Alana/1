 Q.  Alana, what a day for you.  We've been talking about how important these tournaments are to do so well.  How are you feeling coming off the course?  
ALANA URIELL: It feels like it was a surreal day.  I was reading all my putts pretty well and hitting it straight where I wanted to.   
That's all a player can ask for.  I just kept on that momentum and I'm feeling good.   
 Q.  This is one of those tournaments where anything can happen.  You're inching closer to the top 10 there.  What's going through your mind during the last round?  
ALANA URIELL: I wasn't really thinking about the top 10 at all.  I was just thinking about the next shot.  I know that this course is gettable.  My goal this whole week was to make birdies on all the par-5s.   
I managed to do that and I stuck to my goals, and it turned out really well for me.   
 Q.  Over halfway through the LPGA season as a rookie.  A win on the Symetra Tour, but kind of been up and down for you since.  How would you grade your game after a round like this?  
ALANA URIELL: Grade my game?  I give myself an A, and it's really good momentum going into the rest of the year.  It just helps with my confidence on tour.  Just trying to get used to things here with the other girls and on the course and everything.   
But overall, feeling good going into the next half of the year.   
 Q.  What is there to take away going into your next tournament?  
ALANA URIELL: I mean, I got the game, so let's just keep doing that.  Just going to aim and swing and do my thing.
