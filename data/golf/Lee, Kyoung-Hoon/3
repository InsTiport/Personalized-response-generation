 Q.  You got up to 13, what happened after that?  
KYOUNG-HOON LEE: Maybe I think No. 7, par 5, I think I'm very good position on tee shot.  I just confused, I try to go for the green or layup.  So when I hitting third shot over the green, I just a little angry for me.  I think just angry, and then a little struggle with mind.   
 Q.  So the anger kind of got to you until you settled down?  
KYOUNG-HOON LEE: Yeah, like momentum, like the par-5 bogey, and then more difficult to come back to momentum.   
 Q.  So you got frustrated a little bit?  
KYOUNG-HOON LEE: A little bit, yeah.  And No. 10, three-putts.  11, bogey.  So par 5, two bogeys.  I try come back good feeling, but little hard.   
 Q.  It's like an international thing, you've got Germany, you've got South Korea, you've got Australia.  Is it good to see the Tour just as the whole world is starting to play well?  
KYOUNG-HOON LEE: Yeah.  And then I need to learn English.  I try every night.  Getting better.  Maybe next time.
