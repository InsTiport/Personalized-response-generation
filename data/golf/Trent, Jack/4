 Q.  67. How was it out there for you today?  
JACK TRENT: First tee nerves got me. Kind of yanked me tee shot a little left and bogeyed the first hole. Started on 10. Bounced back with a birdie, and after that really started to settle in.   
Turned at 3-under and then just really solid play from there only in.   
 Q.  You're on a sponsor's exemption; you play at UNLV. How did that all come about?  
JACK TRENT: So our (indiscernible)tournament, which is back in March, for the first time allowed a sponsor's exemption for the winner to get into this tournament. I happened to beat Cole Hammer in a three-hole playoff to get into this, so here I am.   
 Q.  I know one of your idols is Adam Scott, and earlier this week you got to play a practice round with him. What did you learn from him and how was that?  
JACK TRENT: Just really super smooth swing, even in person. Just a really great guy. He's been out here for quite a few years. Always good to just talk casually. It was just very casual. Made me feel like I belong out here a little bit.   
It felt natural. I thank him for that.
