   ARRON OBERHOLSER:  I kept it in the fairway for the most part and hit the ball close to the pins, which is new for me this season.  I haven't been doing that this season, most of the season.  So I gave myself some good birdie opportunities.  I made two, I didn't make any bogeys, so it was a really tidy round of golf today.  I got the ball up-and-down when I needed to.  Today was one of the better rounds of golf I've played this year.   
  
  Q.  Sometimes boring is good on a golf course?   
 ARRON OBERHOLSER:  I think that's how most people would describe the round of golf I played today, just very boring but effective.  I like boring and effective.  I'm cool with that.   
  
  Q.  Hopefully there will be some good things to look at tomorrow on the golf course, too.   
 ARRON OBERHOLSER:  Absolutely.
