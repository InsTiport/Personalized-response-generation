  Q.  See you wearing a pink ribbon today, can you mention about the significance of that?   
 ARRON OBERHOLSER:  The pink ribbon just signifies the awareness for Breast Cancer Month in October, and it is designated as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.   
 Dockers asked me to wear the ribbon, and I'm very proud to wear the ribbon and for the cause, and I think it's a cause that obviously needs to be out there.  It's important, and I think everybody knows somebody or knows somebody that knows somebody that's been affected by breast cancer.  So it's important for everybody.   
 Dockers is donating $100,000 to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation for research for breast cancer, which is fantastic.
