Q.   Couple shots out of the lead.   What was the key to your round today? 
TODD HAMILTON:   Today I didn't hit it as well as I did yesterday.   I hit it pretty good yesterday, especially with the wind blowing. 
I did hit some shots, some good iron shots close today, not quite gimmes, but shorter putts, ones that I had been making, not the 10, 12, 15‑footers that I haven't been making.   So it was nice to see some good close iron shots in there, and I ended up making the putts. 
I made a couple bogeys over the two days.   One was a three‑putt, and the other one, what did I do?   Oh, I actually played the hole quite well.   I had some mud on my ball on the second shot, kind of laid up into the rough with the mud on there.   Then I didn't hit the green, didn't get up‑and‑downs.   So even though I made two bogeys, and both of those were today, I'm pleased with the way I've played.   I haven't played very well for a long, long time, and it's nice to see not just a good nine holes, but a good 18 that I had yesterday and then another good 18 the following day, today. 
So I haven't been playing well, as I said, and those back‑to‑back decent rounds, I haven't seen them.

Q.   Did you figure something out earlier in the week?
TODD HAMILTON:   I did.   I did.   Actually, leading up to this tournament I was at home playing and wasn't playing very well, and I came here, I didn't really play that great in the practice round, and for some reason I just stood a little bit taller.   It seemed like I was getting hunched over, and I wasn't giving myself room to hit the ball unless I were to raise up.   And if you don't time it perfectly, you're not going to angle it well. 
And I'd hit some good shots that way, but consistently it wasn't very good.
