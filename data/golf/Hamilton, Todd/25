Q.  Are you satisfied?
TODD HAMILTON:  Not satisfied.  I feel like I played a lot better than I played yesterday, and I scored    I shot worse.  I didn't finish the round off very well.  I didn't hit terrible shots, but I just didn't get the par saves that I needed coming in.
Q.  What was the wind like?
TODD HAMILTON:  It was pretty much in the same direction, blew from the same direction and about the same strength, so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary from yesterday.
Q.  Was it difficult    (inaudible).
TODD HAMILTON:  It seemed like it kind of swirled a little bit, and it was hard.  There were certain holes off the tee that it played a little different    the iron shots in and the pins on the sides, it made a big difference, too.
Q.  What about the greens?
TODD HAMILTON:  They weren't as soft, I don't think, as yesterday.  Yesterday we teed off late, so they were quite bumpy.  Today they were actually not bad.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TODD HAMILTON:  I think it's a hard course.  You know, you're going to make    you're not going to hit every fairway, and if you miss a fairway out here, especially if it's on a crucial hole like a long par 4, you're probably going to make a bogey because it's very difficult to get it around the green, let alone on the green.

The par 3s are tough.  It's not an easy golf course.  Long, par 71, it's hard to make birdies when the wind is blowing, especially.
Q.  Do you feel like you're seeing some signs kind of coming around?
TODD HAMILTON:  Yeah, I've hit some quality shots in situations when I haven't been hitting quality shots, and one thing I've done the last couple days, knock on wood, is I've made a few putts, which I haven't been doing on a regular basis.

So I think I missed three or four cuts in a row, so it's nice to be able to play on Saturday and Sunday for a change.
