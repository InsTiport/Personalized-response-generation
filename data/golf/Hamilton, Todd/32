LEE WESTWOOD:  Delighted to be 1-up at lunchtime. It was a typically close match, never more than one hole in it throughout the morning, but I thought I might go into lunch down. However, I was thrilled to finish three-three-four to end the morning one up. If you can finish that way round here all the time then you'll have a chance in any match. It should make my rushed sandwich taste a little better before we head off again."

TODD HAMILTON:  Neither of us putted as well as we would have liked to. If one of us had then somebody would have been four or five up after eighteen. It was difficult to putt on the greens after so much rain. They were really mushy and we couldn't get the pace right. Having said that we both made some birdies and nobody managed to get too far ahead. This has got the makings of a long day.
