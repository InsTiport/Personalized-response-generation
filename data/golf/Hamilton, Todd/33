Q.
Great playing today, 3-under par 69.  You didn't make a bogey today.  How do you feel so far about your game?  Just one bogey so far through 64 holes.
TODD HAMILTON:  I feel real good.  I hit the ball better today than I have the last couple of days.  I hit a lot of good iron shots in there 10, 15 feet and just couldn't make the putts.  I made a birdie on 17 coming in, which was nice.  I think the 9th hole was my last birdie.

Then I got a par on 18, which is like picking up a half shot on the field.

I feel confident about my game.  I'd like to keep driving the fairway and making putts.
Q.  You said the key word right there, driving the fairway.  You missed a few key fairways yesterday, and today you put the ball in the fairway.  And your iron game, though, you seem like the direction was not always there but the distance was there.
TODD HAMILTON:  Yeah, you're right.  I didn't hit a lot of real close shots, but it seemed like they were all around pin high, five yards short, five yards long.
Q.  Forget about golf for a minute.  Think about next week.  Can Oklahoma beat Texas?
TODD HAMILTON:  They can, yeah.  I will say Texas is due to beat us, but hopefully it won't happen next week.
Q.  Todd, thanks a lot.  Good luck tomorrow.
TODD HAMILTON:  Appreciate it.
