  Q. Todd, good solid round of 68, gets you to 1-under par for the tournament. It's starting to come, isn't it? Sturdy finishes at New Orleans and the Masters, it's starting back up for you?  
 TODD HAMILTON: Yeah, I've been doing a lot of things well but haven't been doing a lot of things great. My driver has been pretty good, making some putts here and there, but probably the biggest thing I need to improve on now is my iron play. When I do hit the good iron in there, which has been few and far between, because I don't do it very often, I feel like I've got to make every putt, and it puts a lot of pressure on your putting.  
  
  Q. You've done a good job of scrambling this week so far, and the putts are falling.   
 TODD HAMILTON: Yeah, so far, so good. I really like the way he's redone the greens, and around the greens it gives you a lot of options to hit different shots. I enjoy playing the bump-and-run shot as opposed to a high lob where you've got to land it and stop it soft. So I like the green complexes, the new ones.  
  
  Q. I know you're a huge Dallas sports fan. Big games tonight for the Mavericks and the Stars. Are you going to be able to watch them both?  
 TODD HAMILTON: Yeah, I think they go back-to-back, I think 7:00 o'clock and then probably 9:00 or 9:10, so we've got a group of guys coming over to the house, and we're going to stay up and watch them until they're over.  
  
  Q. Stars are more important to you, right?  
 TODD HAMILTON: Yes.  
  
  Q. You're a huge hockey fan?  
 TODD HAMILTON: Yeah, big Stars fan. They've had success playing in San Jose. They've done well this year and last year there on the road, so hopefully it continues.
