TONY FINAU: I don't know about all that.  Ended up catching up to me in the first round.  So, again, I'm human, I came back out the second round and just played golf.  The outcome's going to be the outcome.  Whatever happens this week, happens.  It was still an emotional roller coaster in the second round, a lot happened, but to post 10 birdies in a major championship is pretty special.  Gary Player is a guy that I admired, looked up to, I got to know him a little bit doing his charity event, and to be mentioned in the same breath as him as far as major championships is pretty cool for me at this point in my career.
Q. (No Microphone.)
TONY FINAU: I think he was just shaking -- he didn't say anything, but he was just shaking his head.  I made a lot of putts on the front nine and at the end of the round he was, for sure it was the craziest round I think he's ever seen.  So the good news is 10 birdies in a major is pretty good.
Q. (No Microphone.)
TONY FINAU: Yeah, another crazy hole.  I made my first par on 10 -- yeah, about 14, 15-footer, a little right-to-left, and it was nice to see that one fall.  But overall hopefully I make it to the weekend, hopefully even par looks like it's going to be good enough and I'm excited just to have 36 more holes to play.
Q. (No Microphone.)
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it was huge.  I feel like I'm pretty good about bouncing back.  My attitude allows me to do that, never too high, never too low.  And I didn't make a bad swing on 6, we felt like we took enough club to cover the water if we missed right and so I did miss a little bit right, but I thought it was just going to cover the water and be fine.  Unfortunately, it was about a foot short of covering on to the green.  So I wasn't extremely disappointed, just because we hit a club where I should have took that out of play and I made a pretty good swing.  So you just got to keep playing, things like that happen.  It was kind of a shocker with how good everything was going for the first five holes, it was like I almost felt like I couldn't do anything wrong.  So maybe it kind of woke me up.  But I was happy to bounce back with a couple of those birdies and again just post a solid round in my second round.
Q. (No Microphone.)
TONY FINAU: It was nuts.  I think as far as putting went, when you see the first few go in, in the beginning of your round, the hole seems to look a little bigger.  It frees you up and you're not thinking as much.  They say it all the time, the best way to putt is with a really quiet mind.  So when you're making putts, that's what's happening, you're not thinking, you're seeing it go in.  And so I was able to do that the first couple rounds.  Honestly, I haven't hit it great, up to my standards these first couple days, so I'll be looking to clean that up.  And if the putter feels good and stays hot on the weekend, just try and make some kind of a run.  Major championship golf is funny, you never know what it happen on the weekend and so I'll be looking to attack, if I have a chance.
Q. (No Microphone.)
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it was a little bit.  This is a golf course that I like, I think it sets up good for me, and again I was pretty disappointed with my performance on Thursday.  So not that I was anxious, but I was really just looking forward to getting out and playing round two and changing that mojo and getting going.
