Q. There's been a lot of complaints about the 17th hole this week.  What about you?
TONY FINAU: No complaints, not after that shot.
Q. What club?  Can you walk us through?
TONY FINAU: 8 iron, 179 yards.  Yeah, it was a pretty good number.  A little help off the left.  And just hit a perfect -- I put some height on it because I knew that was the only way I was going to stop it on that green.  I think most of the complaints on that green are because the ball doesn't stop.
One thing that I have as an advantage is my height that I can put on it.  So I decided to use it there, and I just hit a perfect shot.  The chances of that happening in a tournament is pretty cool.  That was a special moment for me.
Q. How many do you have, do you think?
TONY FINAU: 11.  I don't think you lose track if you're a pro.
Q. Is that 11 in your life or as a pro?
TONY FINAU: That was my first on the PGA TOUR.  I had one on the Web.  So two on the two tours combined.  The last one I had was in a tournament on the Web.com in 2014.  So it's been a few years.  Great feeling.
Q. What was your first one, just out of curiosity?
TONY FINAU: 9 years old.  Blue course at Doral on the 15.  I was playing a little Doral junior public links.  Hit like an 8 iron from 115 yards and one-hopped in.  So yeah.
