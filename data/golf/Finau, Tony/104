 Q.  The wind, all things considered, what was it like out there today?  
TONY FINAU: It was tough, no doubt about it.  But I was pretty proud of the way I just finished my round, shoot 1-under on the back-9.  Fought my way back in and back into contention going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  What did you have to do out there to stay patient with what the winds were doing?  
TONY FINAU: I don't know.  Lot of thinking, lot of thinking going on.  Every shot needed your full attention and so I think that was about it.  I think hitting shots into the wind, downwind, you had to think about the shot, think pretty hard about exactly what you wanted to do.   
So, just a real tough day.  I think the scores showed that.  And, you know, again I was just happy with the way I finished, hung in there and in contention going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  With the conditions lighting up tomorrow, clearer skies, lot of sun, less of a breeze, what's do you think about the final round?  
TONY FINAU: Lot different.  Got to score.  Two shots back.  Not in the lead anymore.  I'll have a little bit of leverage going into tomorrow to try to get off to a good start I think would be important and put some pressure on the guys that are in front of me.  I look forward to the day.
