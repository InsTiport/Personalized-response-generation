 Q.  67 in your opening round at The Open and a 66 here today.  What is it about this course that you seem to like?  
TONY FINAU: It's good.  It's tough.  I think it's a ball-strikers course and I definitely consider myself a good ball-striker.  It was nice to see some putts go in early and keep that momentum.   
It was also nice that No. 12 is a par 5 this week, because it was a par 4 in The Open.  Par is par.  It doesn't really matter, but you know, it's cool when you make a 4 on that hole and it's actually a birdie, not a par.   
I played really nicely today.  Put myself into contention going into the weekend.   
 Q.  Nicer that the wind has died down?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it was a whole different story than yesterday.  This golf course would have been hard to play yesterday but I think you've got to take advantage on a day like today where there's not too much wind, and I think I was able to do that.   
 Q.  This is your first time playing the event.  What have you made of the courses?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, they are great.  They are great golf courses.  You've got to golf your ball.  I like the creativity that links brings.  A lot different than the golf I'm used to back in the States.  But you know, it's fun to be here at the Home of Golf.  I look forward to the last two rounds at St. Andrews.  Should be a fun weekend.   
 Q.  And is this helping the post-Ryder Cup blues?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, for sure.  It's a perfect atmosphere for kind of the post-Ryder Cup.  Really enjoyed myself with a amateur partner, Ryan Smith.  We are good friends and we're having a good time out there on the golf course.   
You know, playing these golf courses in this type of tournament atmosphere, I don't know if it gets much better, so it's pretty fun.
