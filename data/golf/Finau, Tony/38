 Q.  Another pretty solid, consistent round of golf. How much are you enjoying the Wentworth experience so far?  
TONY FINAU: The weather's been beautiful. You can't beat this, 70 degrees and not too breezy. It's been great. It's been a fun visit. My wife's here with me and we enjoyed the area of London. The fans have been great. The golf course in good conditions. No complaints here.   
 Q.  The wind picked up a little bit this afternoon. Did it give you a little bit more of a different test out there?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it gets interesting when the wind blows. A lot of times, you feel like you have a beat on the direction when you hit a shot, and it's not that direction. That makes it tough coming down the stretch but for the most part, I feel like I was able to gauge it okay and hopefully I continue on the weekend.   
 Q.  Has this been an event that you sort of looked at when it was at a different time of the year and thought, you might like to go over and give it a shot but hasn't quite fit the schedule?  
TONY FINAU: No doubt. Now that it's in September, I think you'll have more American guys fit it in their schedule. It's at a time where we are not as busy, just coming off a little break from our TOUR Championship.   
The way I looked at it, that was the case for sure. Now that it's in September, it's a tournament I may add to my schedule in years to come.   
 Q.  Has it lived up to expectations?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it's a good golf course. Tricky. You have to hit it in play. Every hole allows you to make birdie, but also big numbers lurk on every hole. I think that's the sign of a good golf course.
