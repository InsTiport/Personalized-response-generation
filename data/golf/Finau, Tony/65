Q. Your observations on the match you had?
TONY FINAU: I played great.  I mean, I made birdies, on this golf course, which is tough to do.  I felt good coming in.  I knew I was going to be tough to beat today, and when I got off to a good start, I knew it was going to be hard for Tommy to catch me.
Just stay out of trouble and make pars when you need to, and force him to make birdies to beat me.  I was able to do that, and a really good performance.  I look forward to cheering on the guys.  We look like we're making a run.  See what happens.
Q. Your first Ryder Cup, quite a great feeling?
TONY FINAU: Incredible feeling.  Great atmosphere.  Great to be here and, man, I can't explain just how excited I am, not only about the way I played, but to see my teammates pull through on the front end, to throw a point up there for my team is a huge part.
