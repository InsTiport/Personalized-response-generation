Q. You just won your first Ryder Cup singles match.  Sum up how good that feels?
TONY FINAU: It feels great.  I played incredible golf today.  I was controlling the ball nicely and made some putts.  It was a really hard time for Tommy to get in the match.  He had to make some birdies and just really pleased with my performance and throughout the week, I was able to control my nerves pretty well.  Now we'll see what happens.  Happy to take care of my part.
Q. Looks like some guys may have to turn matches around, maybe Phil, maybe Patrick Reed.  How much confidence do you have in them even though they haven't been in the best of form this week?
TONY FINAU: I have extreme confidence in them.  We were talking about it last night and we know those guys can get the job done.  We put them at the back end for a reason.  They have experience winning golf tournaments and it will be fun to watch.  Hopefully our guys can pull through.
