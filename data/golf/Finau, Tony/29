Q. Is final match on Saturday went down to the very last hole and you were able to get a half-point out of it. How would you describe the ups and downs of this battle?
TONY FINAU: It's a crazy match. We had control of the match pretty much, seemed like the whole day and kind of cruising, and you know, a couple mistakes on 14 and 15. But they played great. Any putt they needed to make, they made. You know, we had a couple halves today. We played some nice golf all day.
I really enjoyed being with this guy out there.
Q. Tony talked about them making putts seemingly when they needed to. You're a veteran of these events. How do you deal with those ebbs and flows when you think you're in control, and next thing you know, it's going the other way?
MATT KUCHAR: I tip my hat to them. I don't know if I've ever seen better scrambling. But in match play, you've always got to expect it. The guys that are missing fairways, missing greens, you expect them to chip it close, chip it in, make putts, and they did it. It was impressive.
Q. You guys started the day three points down, now two heading into Sunday's singles. What needs to continue for the U.S. to come back to win this?
MATT KUCHAR: Well, certainly, I don't envy whoever is playing this guy tomorrow. This is certainly a win for the U.S., and I think there's serious momentum. It's a game of momentum here. I feel like the guys are playing some good golf, and I think the U.S. goes back to the team room feeling awfully good.
Q. What's the most important thing you'll do tomorrow?
TONY FINAU: Win a point. That's going to be the most important thing I'll do tomorrow, no doubt.
