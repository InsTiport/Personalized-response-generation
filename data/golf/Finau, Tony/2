  Q. How pleased with a 3-under par 67?  That back nine was playing tough, wasn't it?
 TONY FINAU:   Yeah, it was.  Played pretty hard.  15, 16, 17, I thought those holes were playing pretty tough with the wind down the stretch.  I was quite happy to birdie the last hole.  Always gives you a good feeling finishing a round.
 Q. You've only dropped one shot over three days.  What's the secret?
 TONY FINAU:   I've hit it nicely.  I haven't put myself in harm's way.  I've hit most of the greens and when I haven't, I've been able to salvage par and get up-and-down.  It's been pretty solid through these first three days and hopefully continue that tomorrow.
 Q. What kind of performance will get this done tomorrow?  What kind of number do you think you need to win tomorrow?
 TONY FINAU:   I think probably somewhere around 65 is what we're looking at.  I think 15- to 16-under is probably a good number to shoot for tomorrow.  You never know what the conditions are going to be like but I reckon one or two guys will start pulling away right around that.  Be aggressive tomorrow.  That's all there is to it.
