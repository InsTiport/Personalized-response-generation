Q. Happy with the start today?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, I am.  I bogeyed a couple holes early, and 4 and 5, I think, so it was important to birdie a couple coming back.  This golf course is playing tough.  It's fast.  The rough is thick.  So you've got to hit fairways to score.  I was able to do that today.
Q. Sometimes with those firm and fast conditions, if you do hit the fairways, you're going to have some opportunities, especially you with your length.  Did you have some shorter clubs in your hand?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, for sure.  I had some good looks.  Even with the way the greens are running, I had some 12, 15 footers.  We were playing 18 inches at two feet of break.  It's just tough to make putts when you have to play that much break.  Although they were short, you had to hit it in the right spots to have a really good look.
Yeah, I was happy with the way I played today.  Big putt for me on 17, made about a 30-footer there for birdie.  That was nice, just to kind of get some momentum.  I had a bunch of pars before that.  I parred 10 through 16, and I hit some nice shots, wasn't able to make any putts, so that was nice to see that one fall on 17 and finish my round that way.
Q. Did you stay patient knowing the putts were going to fall at some point?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, you've got to stay patient.  Especially when you look at the leaderboard and you know you're right there.  You're not losing ground by making pars.  You have to stay patient, and again, I was happy to make that putt on 17 and pick up one more coming home.
