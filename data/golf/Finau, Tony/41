TONY FINAU: It was good. A little bit bittersweet. I played nice. Few guys played better than me this week and then I'm going to be outside the top 8 for the Presidents Cup. I knew what I needed to do this week. I'm proud I gave myself a chance to do that. Going into today I knew I needed a top three finish this week as I consolation of outside of trying to win the golf tournament. Once I knew you Justin was pulling away going into the back-9, my goals were to finish in the top two or top three to make the team.   
So, a little bittersweet but I had a great ball-striking week, the best I've hit it ever. Putter got cold on me a few times I needed it and that's kind of the story for me the last couple of days but proud of the way I fought and 4-under on the back-9 today to finish and it was a solid goal going into the Tour Championship.   
 Q.  Probably didn't expect another 63 from Hideki. That kind of messed you up on the leaderboard a little bit.  
TONY FINAU: He raced out there. He kind of snuck up from behind and next thing you know posted a great one. That's what guys the do. Guys are good out here, they'll make runs and on a golf course where you know you can make birdies. Put the pedal to the metal. I knew I had to shoot 5, 6, 7-under to have a chance to win. Looks like I had to shoot 10. That's how it goes sometimes. Sometimes a guy has an incredible week and that's definitely what JT had this week.
