Q. Another sub-70 round for you, but four solid rounds of golf, 14-under, solo second.  Your analysis of your week here?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it was a solid week.  Really solid all around.  Just really proud of the way I played in the first Playoff event.  It's important to get off to a good start on the Playoffs and off on the right foot.
The way the points system works, somebody in my position can get punched in the neck, really fast.  All of a sudden you miss a cut and guys are starting to creep up on you.  I was proud of the way I played this week to hopefully lock up that TOUR Championship, which is cool.
Q. You're projected right now fourth, and they say if you're in the top 5 going into at Atlanta, if you win, you've got it all.
TONY FINAU: Yeah, great position to be in and that's where I want to be.  When I do win, hopefully it means a lot and maybe even a FedExCup, the rest of these Playoffs.  It was a solid start and I was pleased with the way I played today.  Bryson was extremely tough to catch.  He didn't really open a window for us.  I knew I needed to make a lot of birdies coming down the stretch, and unfortunately didn't go my way.  I hit some good putts that just didn't go in.  That's the way it goes sometimes, and again, just proud of the way I played this week.
Q. And you add more to your resumÃ© for Mr. Furyk to consider for The Ryder Cup.
TONY FINAU: Yeah, I think so, if I'm in the conversation, this doesn't hurt my chances, I don't believe.  I had a solid week all around.  My game feels good and I feel confident.  Whatever his decision is, I'll be ready to play.
