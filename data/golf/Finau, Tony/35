Q. How do you feel after 6-under today?
TONY FINAU: I was happy with the way I played. Missed a short one on 17, but outside of that I played really nicely. I thought it was tough. That front nine, every hole was into the wind. It was quite cool this morning when we teed off, so a lot of those holes played a lot harder than they normally do with the wind. I was happy to get around the front nine in a couple under and I was able to score on the back nine.
Q. What do you think is the key to going low on this golf course?
TONY FINAU: You've got to keep it out of the bunkers. I think if you keep it out of the pot bunkers, more than likely you're going to have some looks, the par 5s, some of the drivable par 4s, you're going to have some looks. I think not being in a pot bunker today was a huge bonus for me.
Q. How much are you enjoying the week?
TONY FINAU: I enjoy it. I've got a great partner, good friend of mine, Ryan Smith. Qualtrics is a sponsor of mine. We are having a good time out there. I've known him for a long time. I think we are keeping each other pretty confident.
Q. How special is it to play at St. Andrews on a Sunday in a tournament like this?
TONY FINAU: Really special. You know, very cool to be at the Home of Golf. The Old Course, there's nothing like it, so to be able to tee it up tomorrow and play and have a chance to win a golf tournament here is going to be something special.
