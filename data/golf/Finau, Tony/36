Q. How do you feel after that?
TONY FINAU: I feel good. It was nice to finish with a birdie. I was able to do that on last hole, and good position going into the last couple rounds.
Q. And the conditions today, obviously the latter part of the day, didn't seem to hamper your golf?
TONY FINAU: It did a little bit. I had a double-bogey on 15. I played nicely. I'm happy with where I'm at and swinging it nice. Make a few more putts tomorrow and try to give us a good chance to win on Sunday.
Q. How do you cope with this competition? It's a bit unique, obviously playing a Pro-Am setup and three different golf courses to try to get your head around.
TONY FINAU: It's different. It's a little strange, having amateurs out there with you, but it's a lot of fun. I have a good friend, Ryan Smith, who is one of my sponsors and a great friend, so we are enjoying being out here in Scotland and having a good time.
Q. Apart from the rain?
TONY FINAU: Exactly. It's fine. Sprinkles are fine. When it starts to rain for two, three hours at a time, that's when it gets too bad. But it wasn't too bad today.
Q. Going into contention the final two days, mind-set must be good as well?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, I feel good. The game is in a good place, and I've got two rounds at St. Andrews to go, a golf course that I like, and last year I was able to score pretty well on. So I look forward to that challenge.
Q. And does that help, the fact that you have the two rounds back-to-back at St. Andrews and you're not changing courses?
TONY FINAU: I do think it helps. Hopefully get some good MoJo going into tomorrow and just ride it into Sunday.
