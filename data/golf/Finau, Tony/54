 Q. I know you're disappointed you didn't get a higher finish. But what was it like getting a close‑up look at history today?  
TONY FINAU: It was great. Not the ending that I wanted. But a handful of years ago I don't know a lot of people believed that Tiger would win another major. From what I saw today obviously he's not going anywhere anytime soon and congrats to him on his 15th major.  
   
 Q. You hung in there early and as you're playing you're throwing stuff at him, everybody is throwing stuff at him, what did you see from him and how did that affect your game?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, I mean I don't know if it affected my game or anything. For me 12 was the turning point. He hit the green and I hit it in the water when Francesco had hit it in the water. I knew from then on I pretty much had a chance to make something happen. I missed an eagle on 15. Had a birdie look on 17. Had a birdie look on 14. So I still could have made something happen coming down the stretch. But 12 was kind of the big swing. And unfortunately I hit it in the water and Tiger hit it on the green and that was kind of‑‑ he rolled that all the way in.   
For me it was fun being a part of the action. And it's a lot of fun to be in that type of atmosphere. It's what I practice for, what I play for, what I train for. My time is coming. I know it is. And I've just got to keep riding the storm.  
   
 Q. Your little guy was here, but he probably doesn't understand what happened. What will you tell him when he's old enough to understands?  
TONY FINAU: I'll tell him I was there when Tiger won his 15th major in the final group. You can't say enough about Tiger and what he's done for the game. It's great for him to be involved in the game and now he's got his 15th major. He's going to be a force to be reckoned with these next few years, I'm sure.
