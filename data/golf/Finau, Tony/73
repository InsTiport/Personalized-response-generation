 Q.  3-under par today, and I think I just heard you say that this is the best 3-under par round you've ever shot.  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it was.  I had to grind out there.  I didn't hit it very well, and it was just one of those days.  Sometimes the game comes easier than other times, and today was definitely one of those times where I just had to grind.  A lot more thinking than I have in the past, but really pleased with my 3-under.   
 Q.  Overall you're experienced; you came into the week at third in the FedExCup standings.  What's it been like here at the TOUR Championship this week with a ranking so high like that?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, it's been great.  It's been cool just to know that if you have a good week and have a chance to win on Sunday, you'll win the FedExCup, something that you compete for all year.  It just kind of speaks volumes to how I played throughout the season.  I'm proud of that, proud of the way I played today, and I'll give it my all tomorrow and we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  What is your goal for tomorrow, aside, of course, from winning the tournament?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, depends on how Tiger finishes up.  He's playing some incredible golf, and we all know when he's out front, he's tough to catch.  Put together a good round of golf tomorrow, and we'll see where that puts me.  I think with all the logistics that I can go on.  And how I can win the FedExCup, I can't really worry about, but I have 18 holes left and still an outside chance to win the FedExCup, which is pretty cool.
