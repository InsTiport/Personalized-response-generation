Q.   71 yesterday, 66 today.   What was the difference?   
TONY FINAU:   I hit it a lot better.   I was able to make some putts, give myself some chances early.   That was nice to make some birdies early.

Q.   Perfect scoring conditions with the greens as good as they are this morning?
TONY FINAU:   They were, yeah.   They were perfect.

Q.   You're currently the second longest hitter on the PGA Tour.   We're going to talk you through the 18th hole.   480 yards long.   Talk us through the difficulty off the tee?
TONY FINAU:   Yeah, it's a tough shot.   You just have to commit to your lines.   You miss left, you're in the water.   You miss right, you're in the sand.   Mine had a nice little pace, started from the left center of the fairway and headed back towards the middle.

Q.   What yardage did you have into the green?
TONY FINAU:   176 to the hole with the upslope.   It's plus 6 to the green.   It's a tricky second shot. 

Q.   That's a tough pin location.   Were you able to leave the ball below the holes today?   That's one of the things they always talk about that's important. 
TONY FINAU:   Yeah, for sure.   I drove it well, so I was for the most part. 

Q.   It's your rookie year out here on the PGA Tour.   You won on the Web.com last year.   What have you found is the biggest difference between the Web.com and playing out here on the PGA Tour?
TONY FINAU:   The golf courses are tougher, first of all.   And then you've got to find your way around, know what you're doing.   You've got to know your game and trust your game, and that's what I'm starting to learn.   I'm getting more confidence and getting a lot better results. 

Q.   You played great this year, three top‑10s this year and finished top‑10 last week at the Byron Nelson.   Thanks for stopping by to talk to us.
