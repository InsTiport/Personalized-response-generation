 Q.  All things considered, this was the hardest course of the three. An up-and-down round for you today. What do you make of this round overall?  
TONY FINAU: Yeah, I was actually happy with the finish. I was able to birdie 17 and save par on 18 after a not very good tee shot, so I was happy with my finish. And it definitely seemed like it played the tougher out of the three days so far. 1-under on the round today and tomorrow we're going to have to do something pretty special. But I shot a 62 this week already, so it looks like I might need that tomorrow.   
 Q.  Yeah, a 62 would go a long way on the Stadium Course. You and I were talking off camera about how sentimental it is coming back to this very spot. Why is that?  
TONY FINAU: A lot of great memories here and specifically I feel like my life changed here in 2013. I got through qualifying school for the first time in my career. And as a young professional it's, I knew the opportunities were going to be endless moving forward. So 2013 was quite a monumental finish for me here. I finished third at final stage. And so I've got so many great memories just being on grounds and it's just so cool to come back and play this place. And again, I feel like my career changed when I got through qualifying school. I knew I had a place to play on the WEB.COM TOUR or the Korn Ferry TOUR now and was able to play my way on to the PGA TOUR. So fast success from that time here, but this place has a lot of great memories for me and a place I'll always remember because of that.
