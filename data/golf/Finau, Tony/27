Q. Unbelievable comeback. Give us a few comments on what happened out there.
TONY FINAU: I was real flat early. Got the best of me and I wasn't all in it. Next thing you know, three back through five holes. I was proud of just the way I fought and just clawed my way back in this thing. My caddie stepped on my face on 10 and said, "Look, we can win this match," and that gave me some confidence and I went on a run there.
I won 11, 12, 13, 14, to square the match, and you know, Hideki birdied 16; that, most of the time, is going to win the hole. He goes 1-up, and fortunately for me, he missed a short one on 17 and I was able to get the halve.
Standing on 10 tee, if you would have told me, you're going to have a 25-footer up the hill, a little left-to-right to win the match, let's fast forward to there. Hopefully that half-point is huge for our team, and I was proud to just not give them the full point and take the halve.
Q. How do you grade your overall performance?
TONY FINAU: I played some great golf. Everybody I played, played great. They really did. I had to come out here and I made four birdies out here today. Every other round, I made six birdies. I mean, this golf course, it's not one that you walk around and say, you know, you're going to make five, six, seven birdies out here. For me, it was an A+.
To score 1.5 points might not seem that way, but I fought for every halve that I got and I was proud of the way that I finished every single match.
