Q. What a terrific back nine.  A little bit scratchy on the first nine, but what helped you flip the switch, so to speak, on your closing nine?
TONY FINAU: Yeah, tried not to panic too much.  I know I didn't play my best on the front nine.  That's the hard one.  That's not as scorable.  Whenever you start on the back nine it just seems that way, if you could just weather the storm going for the front.  The front had more scorable holes with a couple of par-5s, reachable par 4, and I was able to take advantage of that on my backside.  All in all I was really pleased to be able to fight back and be within a handful of shots going into the weekend.
Q. Absolutely.  2-under the first day.  3-under today.  Within five shots right now.  What's it going to take on Sunday and Monday for you to prevail here, do you think?
TONY FINAU: That's funny, it ends Monday.  I keep forgetting it's already Saturday.  Yeah, I've done some nice things this week.  I've got to hit a little bit closer, I think, for the most part, which means I've got to the hit some fairways.  I've got to clean up a few things there.  I like the way I'm rolling it.  The short game is getting a lot better.  You just never know.  I feel good about my game, coming off a good finish last week, and nice start this week.  I look forward to the weekend.
