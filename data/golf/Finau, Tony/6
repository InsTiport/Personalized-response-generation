Q. We have seen you rip off some birdie runs before, six in a row today.  When you get in that type of rhythm what's it like?
TONY FINAU:   It feels good.  I didn't know until my caddie told me.  I knew I had to get going, I didn't have a great start, it was nice to get on that run and get myself back in the tournament.
Q. For those watching at home usually this is kind of a birdiefest, there's some low numbers out there, but what was the test like at the Stadium Course?  How would you rate your day?
TONY FINAU:   I played nicely.  Par-3s are real tough.  The wind started to pick up on our back nine just enough to make you think down the stretch.  You got to hit quality shots if you're going to make birdies down the stretch.
So even though I was 1-over on our last few, it wasn't a bad finish.  So I'll take it and I'll look forward to tomorrow.
Q. What would you say was the key for your game today that you're going to try and then carry over into your second round?
TONY FINAU:   Yeah, I hit my irons really nicely and I gave myself a lot of good looks.
