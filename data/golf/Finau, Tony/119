Q.   You've put yourself in contention so many times in the wrap‑around season, and another chance here this week. 
TONY FINAU:   Yeah, it's early on, first round, but it's nice to get off to a good start.

Q.   Talk about the birdie on the 18th hole, the par‑4, 9th. 
TONY FINAU:   Thanks, that was great.   I hit my irons really well all day today, so it was nice to finish that way.

Q.   One of your greatest weapons is your length off the tee.   I'm guessing you didn't hit many drivers out here, though? 
TONY FINAU:   No, but I'm still able to use my length by hitting 3‑woods and 2‑irons and moving it up the fairway still where most guys would have to hit driver and things.   I hit one driver today, so I definitely wasn't able to use my driver length, but I still use my length off the tee just in different ways.

Q.   Where did you hit it today, on 16? 
TONY FINAU:   On 9.   You guys saw the last‑‑

Q.   And missed it wide to the right? 
TONY FINAU:   I did, I missed it wide to the right.   The hole moves a little right to left and some trees up the left side, so with my ball flight, got away from me a little bit with the wind, but overall I was happy with the way I played.

Q.   You put yourself in good position at Napa and Vegas.   Are you comfortable here with the lead? 
TONY FINAU:   Yeah, again, it's really early.   The morning wave of the first round, so there's a lot of golf to be played, but overall, yeah, I think the more I put myself atop the leaderboard, just the more comfortable you get, I think.
