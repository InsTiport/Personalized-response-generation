Q. I was following Pat Perez.  He was the first player to hit the green at No. 9 in two today.  So a little different program here.  A little bit of an advantage, but still an incredible round of golf by both of you.
RICK LAMB: Yeah.  We both played well today.  I'm glad I'm not out at Pebble, if that's the case out there.  So, yeah, pretty pleased with the round and looking forward to getting to Pebble tomorrow.
Q. What were the keys today?  Just being patient more than anything?
RICK LAMB: Yeah.  Short game was pretty sharp today.  Got up-and-down.  I missed in the right spots, so up-and-downs were pretty easy, and then made a couple good par saves on 9 and 18.  And then made birdies on the par-5s where I needed to and just kind of plugged around.
Q. The group right in front of you, I heard them walking off the green, he goes, "Man, I bet those guys behind us are pretty happy to be getting done."
RICK LAMB: Oh, yeah.  We were off at 7 a.m. and at first, I didn't think it was great I had to wake up at 4:15 today so we were a little groggy this morning, but by the time we got going it was good.  And I think we teed off before the sun actually rose.
Q. Actually, the thing is I think the temperature's dropped about 10 or 15, so you probably did get the better end of it, even with the cooler temperatures.
RICK LAMB: The sun came out for a little bit, but our last three or four holes it started to rain a little bit and we definitely got lucky with our tee time today.
