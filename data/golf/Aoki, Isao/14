ISAO AOKI: Last two days on Thursday, Friday we made 2 bogeys on each day, so we expected two bogeys today too; so first two holes they came too; so we weren't surprised.

ISAO AOKI: I think three hours suspension gave -- made me relax and helped me to cool down after two bogeys, that helped; so I was happy with the  suspension at the end.

ISAO AOKI: You know, the golf course is U.S. Champions; it is not so easy after the rain so it is still difficult.

ISAO AOKI: Normally, you can't control the weather.  You have to stay with nature.  So same for everybody, so I mean, I am not disappointed much.

ISAO AOKI: Number 4, driver 8-iron; 24, 25 second shot 8-iron, number 4.  Number 5, driver 9-iron, 10 foot.

INTERPRETER: He said is my English is funny, strong accent?

ISAO AOKI: Number 6, driver, left side rough, chipped off 8-iron, sand wedge almost to 10 foot and a birdie.  Tee shot, 8-iron one-half a foot and a birdie.  Number 8 driver, sand wedge almost 20 foot birdie.  Number 9, almost a birdie chance, missed six foot.  We just missed it; it ripped out.

ISAO AOKI: Many times, too many to remember.

ISAO AOKI: One time 8 under with 7 holes that is his record.  Last year I play Napa, Silverado last 10th hole, 3-under; do you remember?

Q.  One more birdie 13.

ISAO AOKI: 13th hole is maybe 25, 26, 6-iron to hit the ball, birdie.

Q.  After making the 5 birdies in a row, how nervous were you and how much of your comfort zone did you feel you were getting?

ISAO AOKI: I have been playing well; hitting ball solid last three, four weeks.  I was kind of confident before we started today.  So it depends on putting and putting went well today because that is why I made good scores.

Q.  Have you ever been paired with Weiskopf; have  you played with him much?

ISAO AOKI: Yeah, same age, so many times before we have played together.

ISAO AOKI: Thank you.
