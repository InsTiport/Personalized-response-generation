Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator): He said it was too bad on 17, but that's golf. 
 
Q.  What happened on 17?
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He pulled it a little bit.  He thought it was straight, but he pulled it a little bit. Almost three, four foot.  On 18 he had the right club, he just had to land it on the front of the green, and he thought it would carry over, but it ended up a couple feet short where he wanted to land.  At 15 he hit an 8-iron, but he had a little downhill lie. He thought if he hit a 7, he felt it would scoot past the pin. 
 
Q.  What did you think of the difficulty of the last three holes?
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  If you keep it in the fairway the last three holes, no problem.  But 17 he's kind of a little upset about that, about the second shot. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He kind of hit it fat. He had about 176, hit it chunky.  He said he thought he had a good approach, but that's golf he said. 
 
Q.  Did he think he had the putt on 18?
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He said it wasn't on the green, so -- 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  16 yards, he said. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  Not typically different, but a little windy.  But the tee shot, where it ends up, you could have hit a good shot and still have a downhill or a side lie.  So that is a little bit of a concern.  That's how the course is. There's a little luck involved probably.  Okay.
