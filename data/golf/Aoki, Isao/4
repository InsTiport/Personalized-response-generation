THE MODERATOR:  Isao Aoki, six-stroke victor of the Georgia Pacific Grand Championship.  Congratulations.

ISAO AOKI:  Thank you very much.

THE MODERATOR:  Maybe make a few comments about winning this event.

ISAO AOKI:  I tried all day 70, 70, 70.  I tried 6-under.  (Inaudible)  I had good score today.  I'm very happy with my win.

THE MODERATOR:  Were you watching the scoreboard?

ISAO AOKI:  No.  Super Senior Cup (laughs).

THE MODERATOR:  Obviously you're very happy to end the season --

ISAO AOKI:  Last tournament I win  -- I'm very happy.  After next year and (inaudible) one week off -- maybe May, third week, straight to eight week and six tournaments, next year's schedule.  Now I win.  Good schedule for next year.

THE MODERATOR:  We will go to a few general questions. 


Q.  What does it mean to you to win at this Grand Champions' level now the last several times after being on the regular tour and being with these other guys?

ISAO AOKI:  I am now 61 years old.  I never get tired of this.  (Inaudible) Anyway, every week I try to win.  Now I'm 61 years old and win first tournament.  I am very happy.


Q.  When you see tee it up in a regular tournament when you have the chance to win the whole thing along with the 50-year-olds, even though you couldn't this week, do you still see yourself competing with everybody?  Do you try that?

ISAO AOKI:  I believe already I will win, so I make a chance to win as always.  Every week the Super Senior tournament, the Grand Champions tournament I try to win.


Q.  The par 3s, I think 7 and 14 were big swings for you, can you talk a little bit about those two holes?  You birdied both of them.

ISAO AOKI:  7 hole (inaudible), I hit a 5-iron maybe four feet to make birdie. 

No. 14, (inaudible) 5-iron, hit the ball six, seven foot to make a birdie.  14 was a bit downslope.  (Inaudible).


Q.  Did you feel after 14 that that won it for you?

ISAO AOKI:  Yeah.  No. 10 hole, three-putt bogey.  And the 13, birdied.  (Inaudible) I make two birdies.  Six strokes behind everybody.  I am very relaxed, hit the ball very relaxed.

THE MODERATOR:  Do we have anything else?  Congratulations again.

ISAO AOKI:  Thank you.  See you next year.
