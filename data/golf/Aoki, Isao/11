Q.  Very up and down, pars, birdies and bogeys today.  Ask him to describe that kind of play.

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator): He forgot where he birdied.  Number 5, he missed his tee shot on 5.  Towards the hazard.  And he thought bogey would be fine there.  Then right after he hit a bad tee shot on 8 which caused another bogey.  Parred 9.  And then bogeyed 10.  He thought he would finish about 2-over, but he made a good birdie on 11.  And a good par on the next hole.  Made another about four meters par putt on the next hole.  Then made another good par-saving putt from about three meters.  But after he made the putts to save par, he said he started putting better again.  And he said on the back 9 he started putting better. Hopefully his feeling for tomorrow will -- he said bogey on 18 he's not concerned about it.  He said 1-over today is fine.

Q.  You kidded about the fact that 1-over par is not somebody that people want to talk to, but that's a very good score today. What's your feeling about the way the course played in terms of difficulty?

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator): He said the course was very difficult.  He would have loved to be in at even par, but 1-over, everyone is telling him it was a good score.  So hopefully he can carry on for tomorrow.

Q.  Now that you've got a score that's near the lead, does that change how you approach tomorrow?

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He said he's going to sleep on it, and when he gets up, he'll think about it.

Q.  Thank you, sir.
