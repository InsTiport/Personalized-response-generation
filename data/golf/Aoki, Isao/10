ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  Birdie 12. And on 13 -- 3 foot and a birdie.  16, I 3-putted for bogey on 16.  Number 2, bad drive, short, bad chip, bogey.  Number 3, 8-iron, 3 meters for birdie.  Number 5, 9-iron, about five meters, birdie.  Number 7 he 3-putted for a bogey from about 30 feet.  Number 8, 9-iron about 4 meters, made it.  Anyway, five birdies, three bogeys.  Yesterday three birdies, four bogeys.  Change it around.  Good day today.

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  This morning was quite cooler, a lot cooler than yesterday.  And the holes that were tough yesterday into the wind, they were downwind today.  And yesterday he was a little aggressive, attacking the pins.  But today he just wanted to get it on the green, and that probably worked out a lot better.


Q.  For someone who is 58, he seems like in great shape.  Could you ask him what he does for training and ask him a little bit about his diet.

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He says if he tried to explain it, it would take three, four hours, so please wait.

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  At his age, he just loves playing golf.  For him to keep up the level, he has to do his own training.  And he has his own ways and methods of training.  So explaining it probably wouldn't do much good.

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  Thank you very much.
