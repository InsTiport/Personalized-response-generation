ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He got up early this morning, and he came out and parred 13 and 14, and he -- 12 and 14, and he was happy from there.  And that led him through the whole round today.  He said he 3-putted 16, but he made good par saving putts on 17 and 18, and that kind of erased it and made things better.

Q.  17 and 18?

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  Yes.  4 or 5 feet.  He made them both for par.

Q.  How does he feel about leading at this point?

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He says he's on top, so everyone is surprised, so people are real surprised watching TV, he guesses.

Q.  What was the difference in the way the course played from yesterday to today?

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  The wind was a little different.  Yesterday the tough holes were into the wind.  Today they were downwind.  He made a good putt on 13 yesterday, and that made his putting feel a lot better.  So that's leading him -- that was a big key point right there.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He says he's so much older, he's forgot all about it.  But since you mentioned it, that's coming back a little bit he said.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

ISAO AOKI (Through Translator):  He asked him what his chances were for the tournament, and he's not even concerned about that.  He said he has to make his own chances.
