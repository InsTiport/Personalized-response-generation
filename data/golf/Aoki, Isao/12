ISAO AOKI:  Last year I played this course 73, 74, 74.  Last day maybe Top 30 or 32.  This year I try every day.  Yesterday 70, today 68, maybe tomorrow 67.  Tomorrow 65, I try. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Yes.  This year good condition, greens are very fast.  I like the fast green. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Yesterday, today, no wind, good coming sun.  Tuesday night is meeting, catch cold. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Yeah, husky voice. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  No. 13, No. 2, No. 17. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Oh, yeah, the bunker.  It's okay. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Yeah, it's okay.  Bunker is good, tight course.  Target the bunker, over.  Good for aiming. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Two weeks ago, I joined the US Senior Open.  At the time I was so bad feeling. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Yeah, physically.  That's why I concentrate to shot, and I got on the green.  I concentrate to make a putt.  Maybe I feel concentration is better. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Hit the ball good, just try to target on green, not pin, just green, concentration. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  2nd hole. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Third old is 4-wood, over the bunker. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Got second shot a little bit pushed,  right side of green.  Chip shot, maybe three foot, missed putt, bogey. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  6th hole, 4-wood. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Sand wedge. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Maybe 15, 18 foot to the birdie. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Made it, yes. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Nice tee shot.  Miss. 
 
ISAO AOKI:  Second shot 155 or 160.  8-iron, try, pin-high, maybe 15 foot to the birdie.  Lucky birdie there.
