 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   First day, practice day, I was playing with Angel, I think as soon as I ‑‑ no, actually, it was before that.   
   
 Q.   Monday?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   It was Monday, but as soon as I walked down the stairs from the Crow's Nest, I was eating breakfast and I saw the whole crowd and Rory McIlroy heading to the first tee and hitting drives.   That's when I was like, oh, I'm going to be there in a little, in a moment.   
   
 Q.   Did you sleep much last night?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Yeah, I slept really good, actually.   My bed is really comfortable.   
   
 Q.   What's your secret then?   A comfortable bed and you don't think about it too much?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   I guess, yeah.   I don't have much trouble sleeping at all, so, yeah.   No problem with that.   
   
 Q.   What did you think, now that it actually happened, round one is in the books, what did you think of your first round?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   I'm excited.   I learned a lot.   There's a lot to take in for tomorrow.   My short game's really solid at this moment, so I think it will give me more birdie opportunities, which I didn't have today.   So I think that will just give me more chances for birdie maybe tomorrow.
