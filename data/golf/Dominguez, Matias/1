 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   The course was tough today.   The wind was going every where.   
Then I was working kind of hard to make the cut and definitely on 13 it gave me a chance to make an eagle and take advantage of it, so it put me back in position to maybe make the cut.   Unfortunately, I didn't place the ball well enough to work it close.  
(Wind noise.)  
Q.You played with a couple of past champions the last two days, what did you learn and what was the cool thing about that?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Well, I think how well they know the yardages.   Just how well they know their stuff.   How they act under tournament conditions.   They really hit it really good.   So I think that is something that I can really learn from it.   
   
 Q.   I would think that the hole‑in‑one might be the highlight, but I don't know.   What kind of reaction have you gotten about that?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   I would say that was probably the most fun about this trip this week was the Par‑3 Tournament, making a hole‑in‑one on the same hole as Jack Nicklaus did.   
So I think that that will, I will remember that forever and that really made my week.   Other than that, I didn't make the cut, but I'm happy with how I played, I gave my best.   Now I get to go watch with my friends.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit on that hole?   On the hole‑in‑one?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   On the hole‑in‑one?   It was 123 yards, the wind was into us, so I hit a really small wedge.   It landed about seven yards behind the pin and worked it back.  
   
 Q.   I saw your coach and some people had some chairs set up at 18.   Did they have a chair for you to sit later and watch golf?  
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Yeah, I don't know, I haven't had a chance to see them yet.
