Q.   We just wanted to see if you could talk about your first official round at the Masters, at the Par 3?
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   It was over my expectations.   I mean, it was really fun to have everyone real excited.   My girlfriend got to caddie, too, that made it a lot of fun.   She was real excited.   She was real nervous at the beginning. 
Then making a hole‑in‑one, even better.   I can't ask for ‑‑ 

Q.   Tell us more about the hole‑in‑one. 
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   The hole‑in‑one, it happened that it was my‑‑ the perfect yardage for me.   It was 123.   That is my favorite number.   Actually, I just hit a good shot over the pin, came back, and I saw all the people like, It's going in, it's going in.   Suddenly everyone just goes crazy. 

Q.   Did you get a loud reaction?
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Yeah, it was‑‑ yeah.

Q.   What is your kind of plan going into tomorrow?
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Just going to have a little rest tonight.   I have a dinner, an inaugural dinner, I guess.   Then just teeing off at 12:20 with Angel Cabrera and Louis Oosthuizen.

Q.   Are you excited about being paired with those two?
MATIAS DOMINGUEZ:   Absolutely.   I couldn't have got a better pair.   Both are really nice guys.
