DAVID GILFORD:   I played well.  I putted very well.  Got away with a couple of bad shots with pars and good putts.  I dropped one shot at the third, but apart from that, I played very well.

I haven't played that much, I haven't played particularly well.  I always enjoy playing here.  It's one of my favorite tournaments of the year, really and I like the way it's played.  It's a quite hard event.  The greens are quite firm.  I think it sort of suits me, as well, but I do always like it.
Q.  You pulled out of Italy a couple of weeks ago, did you have an injury?
DAVID GILFORD:   I just had some trouble with my shoulder the last two or three weeks.
Q.  No problems today?
DAVID GILFORD:   It's not too bad.  I had a bit of trouble with my neck, but it disappears.  It's not too bad.
Q.  You've had a few rounds around here, haven't you?
DAVID GILFORD:   I've played every since     '89 was the first year.  I played every year since then.  I finished sixth a couple of times.  I finished about 8th.  Finished about 12th or 13th last year.
Q.  Is it one of your favorites?
DAVID GILFORD:   Yeah, I think it's probably my favorite week.  I love the course.  It's obviously a big tournament, as well.
Q.  How is it playing this week
DAVID GILFORD:   Compared to last year?
Q.      or other years.  A bit bouncy, the guys are saying.
DAVID GILFORD:   It's been like this in the past.  Just depends on the weather.  I think this is how they like to get it.  It's a bit bouncy and the greens are quite firm.  I think if we could get it like this every year, they would like it.  It has played a bit long the last few years because it's been a bit wet.  More rough than they used to have, but I like the course.
Q.  5 under is a good round?
DAVID GILFORD:   Yeah, certainly I was pleased.
