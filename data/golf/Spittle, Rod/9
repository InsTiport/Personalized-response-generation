 Q.   Talk about your round.   I know you had that eagle on 17?  
ROD SPITTLE:   I did.   Again, really, I played pretty steady all day again.   Other than the two holes on the front nine, I birdied 5 and made a great par on 6.   And I just kind of hung around.   Made a couple bogeys on the back nine, but that's going to happen.   
And then I knocked it on the green, 17 is a little more downwind today this morning or whatever, and I knocked it in from 35 feet or something like that.   So all of a sudden I got back to even par in a hurry.   So very pleased.  
   
 Q.   What were the big differences between yesterday and today?   
ROD SPITTLE:   Again, as I said late last night in the dark, just to be warm and dry today.   That's what's so nice.   The course is drying out a little bit, obviously, the greens are a little bit smoother.   So I think these are just kind of the conditions that everybody hopes that we get to play in for a couple more days, I'm sure.  
   
 Q.   Your general thoughts after two days now?  
ROD SPITTLE:   Oh, well, again, hopefully you're hearing the same thing from everybody else, the course is outstanding.   It's just a terrific test.   It's just darn hard.   And you get it in the wrong spot, you're going to pay for it.   
And fortunately I've been able to tip toe around and keep it out of the bad spots.   So I hope to do that for a couple more days.
