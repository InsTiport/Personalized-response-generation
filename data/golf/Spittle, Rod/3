Q. Good job today.
ROD SPITTLE: Thank you.  It's nice to get done.  Get to have some lunch, go have a nap, and see if we're working tomorrow.
Q. How was the course?  Was it any better today compared to yesterday?
ROD SPITTLE: You know, we finished up -- we played late yesterday.  First of all, the course was great, as you know.  Everybody has said that.  And, again, we started, what, 8:00 this morning.  So just a little bit softer, which is to be expected.  Nothing drastically different.  But the course is still great.
Q. Congratulations.  Played well today.  Thank you for everything.
ROD SPITTLE: My pleasure.  Take care.
