  Q. 2-under. The whole group played pretty good, right?  
 ROD SPITTLE: It was a great group. Absolutely great. Mike was out running and Bob, staying close. So very solid for all three of us.   
  
  Q. Just your thoughts on Walton Heath.   
 ROD SPITTLE: Oh, again, as I mentioned to you a couple of days ago, this is only the second time I've been over here. So to me this is kind of classic senior British Open golf. I think we got a little bit lucky today, as you may know, with the weather. It didn't rain at all.   
 So I really wasn't paying too much attention to the scores, but I know there's probably a handful under 70 today because of that.   
 So just a very nice way to get started, I think, for everybody.
