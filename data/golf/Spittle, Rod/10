 Q.   Talk about your round today in general.   You had six birdies?  
ROD SPITTLE:   Yeah.   It was ‑‑ we started on the back nine, of course, and we just got the first hour we just got hammered with the weather and it was windy and raining and I know everybody had a tough day playing in it and I just got off to such a horrendous start and I'm 3‑over after three holes and then kind of got dried out and slowed down and made a whole bunch of birdies after that.   
So it was, considering where we were after the first hour, it was, I'm extremely pleased.  
   
 Q.   Was there something that flipped that helped you make all those birdies especially on your second nine?  
ROD SPITTLE:   Well, I tell you what, we just, again, in the middle of the back nine we just kind of got dried out and got in a little bit more of a routine and so I think that's really all it was, for the most part.  
   
 Q.   Was the rain causing the green speeds to change?  
ROD SPITTLE:   Well, it wasn't so much that, it was just again we just caught it when it was really windy and was raining sideways a couple times.   And it was just, I just didn't handle it very well.   So once it got dried out it was a little better.   And obviously it slowed the greens down a little bit for everybody, but and made them a little bit softer.   So I just, and I was fortunate, I got it back to even par after the, our first nine holes and then made three birdies on the front nine.   So I'm very pleased.   
   
 Q.   Especially since there weren't a ton of low scores in the afternoon?  
ROD SPITTLE:   We were just trying to stay warm and dry, I really didn't pay any attention to the scoreboard.   And so, like I said, to escape the way we did, was just great.
