ALISON NICHOLAS: Well, it was a good match,  basically.  It was always going to be a tough day,  playing two such good players, and we are thrilled  about the way we played, we just didn't hole putts.  Completely opposite of Dalmahoy.  We holed first, then  put the pressure on them, they didn't make them, and  they did the same to us today.  They made them 15  feet.  We were inside them, we just didn't make them.  So just one of those days.  But we played really well  and we are just going to think about that tomorrow,  take the positive things out of the game.   
 

Q.  How did you feel about what happened at the  third hole?  On the green at third hole?  When Laura  missed, Mochrie shouted out, "yeah."  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: Didn't hear it.   
 

Q.  Did you see what happened at the 8th hole  when Dottie didn't get the ball out of the hole, she  sank the putt?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: No.   
 

Q.  You didn't see that either?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: No.  I didn't take notice on  what was going on, really.  I was trying to focus on  what I was doing.   
 

Q.  Did you think it was in good spirit on their  part?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: The two players were fine,  no problem.   
 

Q.  Tomorrow, who has the edge going into  tomorrow?  All tied up, who has the edge?  
 
ALISON NICHOLAS: You want to answer that?  (Pointing to Beth McCombs).  Laura, where are you?  It is 5-5, it's tied,  anything can happen.  I mean, it is match play as you  know.  I think both sides will be going out there  fighting and I am not going to predict one way or the  other because I have no clue.  Just go out there and  see what happens.
