   ALISON NICHOLAS: They fought hard and they came out firing on all cylinders. I think the first matches were well under par. The girls tried to keep with them, but they just holed a few more putts than us. 
 I've had a great week (tearing up). The girls have played well. It's been good fun. But obviously disappointed. 

 Q. Going into Sunday's match if you knew you were going to be tied up when you were flying over here to play the Solheim Cup, would you have taken it?
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Yeah, definitely. We've had a great week. We battled hard, and all you can do is take all the good points out of it. I've had a fun week. It's been really an experience. The girls have played fantastically, not surprising. They've really battled hard. It's tough to come over here and win, and to be honest with you, we were huge underdogs to start the week. 
 From that point of view, I think we've done ourselves proud.
