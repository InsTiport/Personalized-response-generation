 Q. Ali, are you surprised about Cristie Kerr? 
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Yeah, I mean, it's devastating for both Karen and her, because Karen's not very experienced in the singles, you know? But I had no idea that Cristie was injured, so, obviously, I'm sorry for her. 
 It's just one of those things, isn't it? It's in the captain's agreement and we've signed it, so there's nothing I can do. 

 Q. Can you talk about the match-up? 
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Well, Karen Stupples was on the range trying to hit some balls. (Indiscernible). So he came up and shook hands with Karen's caddie and then Karen Stupples. Then I heard on the radio that she's got five minutes. 
 But still an announcement was made on the tee and there was some confusion with the referee. So at the moment I'm not entirely sure. I think that it's a conceded match.

 Q. Yeah, we're hearing it's a point for Europe, but you don't know for sure?
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Well, I think there is a lot of procrastination going on, but I don't know whether the officials actually said it, or I'm not sure because I'm hearing different things on the radio. I think that's the case.

 Q. You've got to feel for both girls. Karen Stupples really wanted to go out there and play and get the point for Europe. 
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Oh, absolutely. She's gutted. Obviously, I'm very sad for Cristie. I'm devastated for both of them. I'm really sorry about the situation, but you know it's in the captain's agreement so, it's unfortunate.
