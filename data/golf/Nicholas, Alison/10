  Q. First of all, how emotional was that last hour and a half for you?  
 ALISON NICHOLAS: It was just phenomenal. The girls just fought back, stuck in there, made a few mistakes but carried on, looking forward, and Mimi hit the most unbelievable chip that I've ever seen on 17. If you tried it ten times you'd be lucky if you got it once and she did it under huge pressure, and it was sensational.  
  
  Q. How strong is your team mentally at the moment?  
  ALISON NICHOLAS: They're good. They're just fighting. We had the video from Seve: that was the secret that I didn't tell anyone. We had a video from him, and some of the stuff he said, just hanging in there and thinking about him and thinking about fighting until the bitter end. I'm just so proud of them at this moment, absolutely awesome.  
  
  Q. They've certainly raised their game to this occasion. What's your role this afternoon?  
  ALISON NICHOLAS: I'm going to go back out and I'm going to do the par-3s again because I'm the only person that can give information, so I should be on the par-3s and I'm just making sure they're smiling and having fun and I tell them a few jokes while we're out there and just making them laugh.  
  
  Q. How are you coping yourself as captain?  
 ALISON NICHOLAS: I'm doing pretty well. It's tense out there, and I haven't got to play a shot, so it's perhaps a lot easier from that point of view. But yeah, it's tense, but the most important thing is that we enjoy it, we have fun, and I keep the girls smiling and fighting.
