 Q. Ali, are you surprised about Cristie Kerr? 
 ALISON NICHOLAS: Yeah, I mean, it's devastating for both Karen and her, because Karen's not very experienced in the singles, you know? But I had no idea that Cristie was injured, so, obviously, I'm sorry for her. 
 It's just one of those things, isn't it? It's in the captain's agreement and we've signed it, so there's nothing I can do.
