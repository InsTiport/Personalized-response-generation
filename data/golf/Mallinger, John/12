 Q. The conditions in the afternoon today, what was it like out there? 
 JOHN MALLINGER: It felt like every hole was into the wind. It was pretty tough. It was probably one of the toughest of the year. 
 You know, it was just kind of a patience day. I hit it horrible but I putted well. I just kind of had to grind it out. 

 Q. It seemed today that the scores were better in the morning. I don't know what time you got here today, but did you notice it appreciably getting worse?
 JOHN MALLINGER: It was windy this morning but not as bad as when we teed off. When I got on 11 tee box, my second hole, it was probably 30, 40 miles an hour. I must have remarked four or five balls just because they were rolling on the greens. 

 Q. You remarked twice? 
 JOHN MALLINGER: Yeah, I just kept --

 Q. How far was it rolling? 
 JOHN MALLINGER: Enough to where I had to remark my line and line up again, but if I don't address the ball, the ball is in play. 

 Q. Was it a frustrating day? Was it just kind of a day where you had to just kind of focus differently? 
 JOHN MALLINGER: You know, kind of just grind mode. Like yesterday was a lot different, perfect conditions, you're flying at all of the flags. Today you're hitting away from flags. Just a different type of golf. 
 You know, it's good. It changes up the score and it's not 30-under par. Still right in the tournament, and in a good spot, so looking forward to the weekend.
