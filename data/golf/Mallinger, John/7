Q.   After an opening 72, not just one 66 but back‑to‑back 66s, got you right in it. 
JOHN MALLINGER:   Yeah, I just started off solid today.   I shot 4‑under on the front, and I just hit the ball well all day.   I didn't have any mistakes.   I didn't make bogey.   The only good save, basically the hard save, was the last one on 18 which was big going into the last day; you want to get that momentum and keep going.
It's one of those golf courses, a placement golf course that you have to think about it.   The wind swirls a lot and you've got a lot of shots where you are off the tee into the wind, and you get down there and it's downwind.   It's just a different style golf course.   It's a great golf course for me.   It sets up great and just looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   You had the great week at Humana early in the year, kind of up‑and‑down a little bit since then; but you're feeling confident now as we get into the middle of the season?
JOHN MALLINGER:   Yeah, it's been really good the last couple months.   My ball‑striking has been great.   Just haven't putted well, which puts some pressure.   And finally got some putts to fall yesterday and they kept falling today and hopefully it keeps going tomorrow.   Looking forward to it.
