  Q. Good guys always wear white. John Mallinger, a stellar 62 out there. You did what you had to do today.  
 JOHN MALLINGER: Yeah, I did. I started the day I felt like I needed to get 7 or 8. You know, I just kind of shot for that number. I kind of stayed patient, went through my routine, played my golf and I got hot on the front and the then kind of cooled off and made eagle coming on 15. That kind sparked me.   
 Overall, I'm excited to next week. Hopefully it stays there. Right now I'm in. Things can change but it looks like I may be playing next week.  
  
  Q. Always good to make an eagle on the Kodak Challenge Hole. That will help the other stats.   
 Did you leave anything out there? I know that it's hard to say shooting 62, but you guys are good.  
 JOHN MALLINGER: I left a couple ones. Other than that, I played great. I didn't make any bogies. I think I missed maybe one or two greens, couple of fairways but, you know, I did well.  
  
  Q. What do you do, just sit in the dugout?  
 JOHN MALLINGER: I had a flight at 6. I have to postpone it.  
  
  Q. That was a great round. Good luck next week.  
 JOHN MALLINGER: Thank you, I appreciate it.
