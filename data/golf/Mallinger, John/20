  Q. The last two weeks the public has seen a lot of good play out of you. How would you explain it?  
 JOHN MALLINGER: Probably just my golf swing. I went home the week before THE PLAYERS and I did a good three or four sessions with my golf coach, and really just got it where it needed to be.   
 And once you start getting that confidence and start making some putts, that's kind of how it goes.   
  
  Q. Can you explain what exactly goes into that?  
 JOHN MALLINGER: Yeah. I mean my golf swing started to get a little steep on my back swing, so I keep my glove in around it, and it's been more consistent.  
 And I started making some putts.   
  
  Q. Did you learn anything last week?  
 JOHN MALLINGER: I learned I can play there. I learned that I can be with the best players in the world, and I'm just trying to blow it out and keep going and back in position where I need to be and ready for this week.
