 Q.  John, you hit through the first three holes today plus 1, and then birdied 6 out of the next 15.  That's a pretty good way to bring it to the house. 
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah, I played solid today.  Kind of got off to a sluggish start.  Had taken the entire week off last week, just practiced one day. 
 And I just kind of wasn't into the tournament mode.  Then got one to fall, and then next thing you know six of them did. 

 Q.  What's it like to take a week off and try to get back in the rhythm?  How do you do that? 
 JOHN MALLINGER:  It's tough, you know.  You've just got to somehow mentally get ready for the tournament.  And sometimes it just takes a lot longer than others. 

 Q.  This Atunyote golf course is new to everybody.  Some people saw it last year - what do you think about it? 
 JOHN MALLINGER:  I like it, you know.  I wish the fairways were a little narrower.  But the shape's great and the greens are fantastic. 
 But if they just brought the fairways in a little bit, I think it would be a little better test. 

 Q.  What's working for you best this week? 
 JOHN MALLINGER:  The putter, you know.  I love these greens and any time you can get comfortable on greens, it's a lot easier to score. 

 Q.  Solid opening round, birdie on the last hole to get to 5 under.  Good start, John. 
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Thank you, appreciate it.
