  Q.  John, finishing at 15-under par good tournament this week?   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah, I played well this week.  It was just one of those things coming down the stretch where I didn't make putts and that's how you win tournaments.   
 Flesch kind of got away from us but second with a looking pretty good, and I didn't just capitalize.   
  
  Q.  You seem very comfortable with your game right now?   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah it feels good.  It's probably the best it's been right now.  I'm unfortunate to be in this situation a couple of times this year but it's not that big of a deal.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the successful season you've had.  You're 62 on the Money List and imagine that will improve after your finish here this week?   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah, hopefully reset my goals and maybe get in some majors next year and looking forward to maybe a start in the Masters or something.
