Q.   What a nice round of golf:   clean card, 5‑under par, perfect start.   Tell me about it. 
JOHN MALLINGER:   Yeah, I played all right.   I didn't drive the ball great.   It was kind of cold this morning and I just couldn't get my driver going.
I was putting well and made the five birdies and no bogeys and a couple good par saves.   Other than that, it was just a nice, solid round.

Q.   I saw the two‑putt birdie on your final hole today, the par‑59th.
JOHN MALLINGER:   Yeah, I drove it down the middle and hit a 5‑wood in for about 240.   Just a solid hole.   Two‑putt and got my birdie.   Good way to finish.

Q.   What is it about this section of country that you seem to play so well?   I've seen you play so well at Pebble Beach about 100 miles away or so.   What is it about northern California that suits your game?
JOHN MALLINGER:   Well, I'm from San Diego, I'm from California, so it has something to the with the turf.   I don't know what it is, but I love playing here, I love coming to CordeValle. 
It's a great event.   Frys puts on a great tournament.   Couple years ago I put myself in a good position, so I'm hoping to get back there.

Q.   I think you're 98th on the Money List.   What are your goals in the Fall Series, besides just a win?
JOHN MALLINGER:   Yeah, obviously a win would be great, but I set out a goal before Fall Series to try to get in the top 70 so I can get into invitationals next year. 
Coming off a weird year last year.
