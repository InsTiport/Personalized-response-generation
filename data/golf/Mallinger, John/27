  Q. Well, you didn't start your day off the way you wanted to with a bogey, but after that it was all good.   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah, I played solid today.  It was a tough day, you know?  We had about ten holes of that wind, and coming in it was kind of difficult.   
  
  Q.  We were talking, Dennis Paulson and I, about the difficulty playing downwind holes.  A lot of people think it's real easy but it actually makes it harder because of how firm these greens are.   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Yeah, definitely.  You get about three or four coming downwind coming in, and it's tough to hold the greens.  I'd actually rather have it into the wind.   
  
  Q.  I saw a couple of the approach shots coming in.  You tried to land it just a little bit short of the green for those front hole locations, but it looks like it's a little wet.   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  That's the tough part.  It's kind of wet in front but firm on the greens, so sometimes you've just got to take 30-footers.   
  
  Q.  How good does it feel to have a 3-under par in the books now and you can go relax.   
 JOHN MALLINGER:  Good.  It's good to get off early.
