 Q. Kind of an up-and-down day there, but at the end of the day you're going to be right there going into tomorrow.
 JOHN MALLINGER: That's understood. Started off great, played the front end probably the best I could, and then off the back started getting some breeze. 
 And I didn't hit that many bad shots, just kind of played the wrong club and with the altitude and the wind and everything it's tough. Once that breeze kicks up... 

 Q. You said you got off to a hot start on the front nine and then stumbled a little bit and brought it back a little bit at the end. Does that give you any momentum?
 JOHN MALLINGER: For sure. I think the birdie on 17 was good for me. Got me right back to where I needed to be. I think they're playing threesomes tomorrow afternoon. I feel like I'm right where I want to be.

 Q. Any thoughts going into tomorrow just overall?
 JOHN MALLINGER: Just trying the same type of thing. I think it's going to turn out to be a good day. 
 Scott's playing well, he's the host. He's the local guy. So there will be plenty of people out there cheering for him, so it'll be a good day.
