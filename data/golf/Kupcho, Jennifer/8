Q. We're here with Jennifer Kupcho who just wrapped up a 3-under 69. Pretty good way to start of your first Asia swing. How do you feel right now coming off the golf course?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Really good. I played really well. Came out here with a couple goals. One was to hit 16 greens and one was to make five birdies. I did both, so it's definitely a big, great success.
Q. Always like to hear someone who finds their goals. Tell us about those five birdies. Any of those moments that really stood out to you?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Not really. I was just hitting greens and really on the edge all day, and then a couple fell in and that was pretty exciting.
Q. You're starting your first Asia swing, like we said. First time playing here in Shanghai; first time coming to this side of the world. What has the whole week been like for you so far? Is it living up to your expectations.
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, it's crazy. I didn't realize the jet lag would be so bad. On top of that I have a head cold so, it's been a little rough, but it's nice.
Q. What are your thoughts on this golf course? It looks absolutely lovely with all the flowers out there. Clearly seemed to suit your game today.
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's beautiful. The greens are really big and it's interesting just because you're playing backstops, you're kind of playing every which way it's going to bounce, so it's definitely a fun golf course.
