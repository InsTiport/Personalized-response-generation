Q. Jennifer, 1-over par in round two, even par for the championship.  Now that you've played Jackrabbit and Cypress in competitive rounds, how different are they?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I mean, they're a lot different.  They play a lot different.  I thought Jackrabbit was a lot easier than Cypress for sure.
I mean, the greens are huge on Cypress.  You really have to pay attention.  It's also longer.
Q. You mentioned the big, massive greens out there on Cypress.  Two more rounds to go on the weekend there.  How would you change your strategy at all, or how will you better navigate the greens?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Honestly, just hitting the ball better.  I didn't strike the ball really great today, so just hitting it on target - general target at least.  I wasn't really anywhere close, so...
Q. Even par through two rounds; 7-under leads the championship; seven back.  Still 36 holes left in the championship.  As a competitor, as a player, how do you mentally prepare and how do you look forward to the weekend to try to ultimately win this championship?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I mean, just go out there and play.  Anything can happen.  It's the U.S. Open.  It's not over until it's over.  Just go out there and play my game.
