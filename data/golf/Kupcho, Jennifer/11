Q. Where were you when they blew the horn?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: 18 fairway.
Q. What was that like?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I was kind of mad.  Obviously it was really playing slow today.  I had a goofy lie on 18 and I was like, oh, good.  I get to come out and hit a goofy lie shot over water.
I would have liked to hit that shot at least, but you can't always get what you want.
Q. It is what it is.
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah.
Q. How would you describe your round today?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, I was able to recover really well.  I didn't hit many fairways, which you definitely need to do in a major.
When I did hit the fairways I didn't have very good lies in the fairway, so just go out there and hope for the best.
Q. Will your strategy change going into the weekend?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: No.  I think I just need to go get my swing flowing a little bit better.  Wasn't too hot today.
Q. Overall thoughts of Evian, the town, the experience this week?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's great.  It's fun.  Yeah, it's really nice.  They're all really welcoming.
Q. Have you managed to pick up any French?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I have not, no.
