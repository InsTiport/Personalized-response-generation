  Q. Jennifer, what a great week here at Golden Ocala.  How do you feel now that all four rounds are over?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Really great.  I was hitting the ball really well last week and came into this week doing the same thing, so it's nice to see all the work that I've put in over off-season to really come out and start the year really well.
 Q. Going off that, what does it mean to you to start the year so well?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   It's amazing.  I mean, I didn't start very well last year after COVID happened and everything, so really just to come off a break, it's nice to be able to see that I can come off a break strong.
 Q. And we've got two weeks after this.  What are your plans ahead of the next event?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Just work on getting stronger and continuing to focus on my game.  Pretty much the same thing I did over the off-season.  I think it will be nice to have a little bit of a break for sure for a couple days.
 Q. I thought we were going to see some magic again on 12.  Take us through the hole and what did you hit and that putt?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I mean, I nearly played it the same as I did at Augusta actually.  Obviously missed my hybrid to the right instead of the left.  I thought the putt was falling the whole way and just wrapped right around the hole.  Really tough hole location to make a putt on for sure where I was at.
 Q. What was your distance in on that shot?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   I think I had 200 to the flag approximately.
 Q. Which hybrid was it?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   I have a four hybrid now instead of a three.
 Q. So you had some momentum there.  Just take us through the rest of that back nine and obviously 15.
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I set myself up after 12 to be able to make a little bit of a move.  I just missed a pretty easy up and down honestly, on 13, and obviously missed the putt on 14.  It was really close as well.
 But I didn't really think it was over until I hit the tee shot on 15.  Everyone hits bad shots.  It's just unfortunate that's when mine came for the week.  I can't really look at that.  There are plenty of other shots throughout the four days that I could have made (indiscernible).
 Q. A couple comments on the Austin played.
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, she played really well.  I played with her Saturday and Sunday and she makes golf look really easy out here for sure.  It's unbelievable.  Like the lag putts that she hits, they're all really close to the hole.
 Q. Americans have won the first three tournaments of the season for the first time since 2007.  Do you feel like this is a resurgence?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I mean, I think all of us are trying to get on that Solheim Cup team, and that definitely brings the best out of all of us, working really hard to get on that.  So I think that is the main thing.  I think that's why we're all playing so strong right now.
 Q. Do you think about Olympics, too?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, it's definitely a goal, but I wouldn't say it's super realistic.  I'm just going to go out there and play the best that I can to try and reach my goals.
 Q. Just two more from me.  After a year where health was so important, what will you do in the off weeks to recuperate and also focus on your health?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, I mean, it's just I got to go home and relax a little bit, get lots of sleep, and continue to work out.  I've done that a lot in the off-season, so just continuing to do that and make my mind stronger.
 Q. Last question:  This is a Drive On Championship, our third.  What does it mean to you to have a Drive On Championship and do you look forward to seeing more LPGA Drive Ons?
 JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, it means a lot.  We obviously are a great tour and it's really awesome to see us doing this and having great tournaments as well.  So it's always a fun tournament and it's great to see different courses that we don't normally play year after year as well.
