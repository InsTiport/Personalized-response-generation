Q. You were down after 7, and you came back?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, me and Kristen just talked about it.  We knew we had to make a lot of birdies, so we couldn't just start going at pins.  In this kind of format you have to go for pins.  You can't really be conservative.  You always have a partner that can hit to the middle of the green after.  So we started doing that, and then we made birdies.
Q. Is that your normal style of play, going for pins.  No.  When I play individually, I kind of hit to the middle of the green, and if I move it one way or the other to a pin, but I'm in the middle of the green?
Q. This must have been fun, then.
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, it was awesome.
Q. The U.S. have had different pairings in all of the first nine matches, combos.  Does that speak to the depth of the team?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I think we all just get along really well.  We all have our own styles of play.  We all can play just as good as anyone else.  We can kind of pair with anyone.
Q. Did you practice with Kristen in four-ball beforehand?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, I did.  I practiced with her.
Q. Do you think part of it is that you guys are so familiar, seeing each other in tournaments every year, so really nobody is a stranger?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, I think that definitely helps.  I know a lot of the girls played AJGA together.  I didn't personally, but I see everyone in college.
Q. Did you play any AJGA?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I played one, and it was in Colorado.
Q. Going in on paper, y'all were ranked higher.  Did you sort of try to put that aside, knowing they could still be the tough opponent?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, yeah.  I think probably the U.S. always has high-ranked players, so we just tried to forget about that.  Match play anyone can win, so yeah, just go out there and play our own game.
Q. Can you talk about the wedge?  Was it wedge you hit back here?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, 15.  I just had like a perfect club.  Me and my caddie had talked about it, and if I went a little long, then it would just come back down the slope, so I just kind of swung at it, and it came down exactly where I wanted.
Q. Do you take any pride from knowing you've been out first twice?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, a little bit.  I mean, they have a really strong field, and I think it's great to finally (indiscernible).
Q. What did Virginia say to you?  Did she explain to you here's why I put you here?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Not really.  I think me and Kristen just knew that we were really golfing well and we were going to pair really well.
Q. Did Virginia before the match say, hey, I might mix it up, I might not?  Did she talk about that?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: No, but we kind of just figured for four-ball we could be paired with everyone, so we kind of figured it would be different.
