JENNIFER KUPCHO: I started out really strong and then made a couple mistakes with club selection on the 3rd and 4th hole and just kind of went out from there and just was trying to hit to the middle of the green and nothing was falling until I got to the back nine.
Q. Can you talk about the back nine?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I just was hitting to the middle of the green, hitting greens and just putting them really close to the hole for tap-ins and just playing consistent.
Q. You obviously have a lot of experience with USGA championships.  Did that help you coming into this week?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, a little bit just because I know what's expected, what's going to make the cut.  So just kind of go out and play my game and do the best that I can.
Q. And how does the course fit your game this week?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I think it's long, so that kind of helps me because I hit it pretty far, and I think my putting is pretty good, and the greens are kind of hard to read, so I think that helps a lot.
Q. Going into tomorrow's last round of stroke play, what's your mindset?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I think just continue my game, just play safe, play smart, and I should be fine hopefully.
