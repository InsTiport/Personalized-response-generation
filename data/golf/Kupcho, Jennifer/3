Q. Talk about the day overall?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   I mean, didn't hit the ball super great so I couldn't really expect to play as good as Mel was playing, but I gave it my best shot with what I brought to the course today.
Q. How was your back today?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   It was fine.  The inflammation went down last night so didn't really hurt too bad today.
Q. How much of the door was open when you birdied 17 and Mel bogged?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Honestly I didn't think anything of it; 2-down going into a par-5 downwind we were all going to get there or get close.
Yeah.
Q. What do you take out of this week?  Are you going into KPMG?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   I am, yeah.  I mean, just like looking back on this whole week and how much I fought through all the adversity that I came across, I'm really proud of myself and I'm excited to go into next week.
Q. Some good experience also being this the final group there.  What was that like for you, and how are you going to take that into next week?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Yeah, it's definitely just a different feeling.  Obviously I've won a lot of events as an amateur, but playing as a pro and trying to win an event it's completely different.
So just taking all those nerves and the experience, it takes a few times before it's going to come through, so...
Q. You played this event last year after your U.S.  Women's Open pro debut there.  Being able to look back at how much you changed over the year, what would you say about how far you've come?
JENNIFER KUPCHO:   Unreal.  Like I never would've been able to hit these wedges this close last year.  I've just come a long ways and it's exciting to see the improvement over the years.
