Q. Solid finish to the week, T5.
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Thanks.
Q. As of right now.  Considering how many weeks you played back to back to back, your position here, what was your takeaway from the week?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, honestly, still like the fact that I can't finish a tournament honestly strong.  But getting to play with Stacy and Lexi yesterday, definitely seeing how their ball-striking is and how good their iron game is, definitely something to work on and definitely can learn and did learn from their games.
Q. Yeah.  What specifically did you take away from Stacy's game today?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, honestly, she plays about the same as I do.  She hits it about as far.  Honestly just her iron game was so good.  Her putter was good.  (Indiscernible over radio) wasn't very good today, but definitely her iron game.
Q. What does that do to for your confidence seeing how much of a veteran player she is and you coming out as a rookie?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's amazing.  Obviously I know I can compete alongside her and know what I need to work on.  Really brings out my weaknesses in my game by playing with her, yeah.
Q. You just earned a spot into the Women's British Open.  What does that do for the momentum going into the rest of the summer swing?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's great.  Just coming off two missed cuts, obviously I wanted to come out and play strong, and with a caddie switch.
So it's definitely great to get a little bit of confidence going and see my game on the upswing.
