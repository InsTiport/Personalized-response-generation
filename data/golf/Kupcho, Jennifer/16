Q. Round one, not in the lead, but a very solid round.  A tournament that has to be kind of very special to you.  Playing on the NCAA Championship last year and returning now as a pro, how much more special is this event than perhaps a standard one?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's really nice.  I mean, honestly just to show up to a course that you're familiar with, you know where the locker rooms are, where the range is, it's all really nice.
Obviously I know the course.  I know kind of how the greens break and everything.  So it's just more of a comfort zone, and it's fun.
Q. And you have to appreciate the commitment they make to the younger stars and amateurs by way of exemption.  We've also seen some success, not only last week, but also on the men's and women's tours.  Is that a little bit of an inspiration to you?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, definitely.  I know Matthew Wolff, so being able to cheer him on, he cheers me on, I think it's just a great environment of all the young people.  We all support each other and we're all friends.
Q. What's been best part and what's been the toughest part about getting your feet wet on the LPGA?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I would say the travel and honestly the time commitment.  You're going to pro-am parties, pro-am dinners, and still playing the tournament, playing practice rounds.
So it's just a lot of golf every week compared to once every couple weeks in college, so definitely that's a big difference.
Q. And the best part?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Traveling to all the cool places probably, yeah.
