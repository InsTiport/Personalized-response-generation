 Q.  Great round.  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Thank you.   
 Q.  How much were you paying attention to the board coming down the stretch?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I was definitely looking at it, but I wouldn't say I was looking at the lead.  I was looking at how high I want to get up for how much money I was going to make.  That's what I was thinking.   
 Q.  So going for it on 18 was more about a paycheck?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yes and no.  I had a really good lie.  As soon as I walked up to it there wasn't a question in my mind that I was going to go for it.   
 Q.  What did you hit there?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: 4-iron.   
 Q.  When you look up at the board and see where you are, talk about your feeling right now.  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It's crazy.  I definitely played really well this week, and it's exciting to see that I can compete where my game is right now.   
Excited for the rest of the season.   
 Q.  As you were hitting into 18 and over here, did you know where you stood on the leaderboard?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yes, did.   
 Q.  (Regarding imagining the back nine at a major o Sunday afternoon.)  What was it like?  You seemed to be playing pressure free.  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, it was fine.  I was just out there having fun.  Coming into the day obviously I was a long ways back, and I was just like, I'm going to go play well.  I play really well in the rain so I wasn't worried about it.   
Came out and played really well.   
 Q.  What is it about the rain that suits you?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I don't know.  I think it's just everyone else kind of complains about it and kind of lose the mindset, so then I just say, Well, everyone is playing in it.  We're going to be out here, and here we are.   
 Q.  You mentioned Brooks Koepka earlier in the week.  Is that from watching Golf Channel and picking that up, or are you a fan?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yes, I am a fan, but I think it was on social media that he said it.  I was like, I mean, it's true.  You just have to treat it like any other tournament.   
A lot of people crack to the pressure, so...   
 Q.  Did it this feel like Augusta National in a way in terms of pressure toward the end?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I don't know.  It was probably about the same.  I don't think at Augusta I ever really felt nerves.  I'd definitely say over that putt on 18 I was kind of freaking out.  I had to take a couple deep breaths as I was lining it up, so...
