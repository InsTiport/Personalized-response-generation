 Q.  Jennifer Kupcho, 2-Under, 211 total.  How was your round today?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: It was good.  I definitely struggled a little bit the beginning with tee shots.  Got the groove going at the end and just missed a couple putts.   
 Q.  How much was wind a factor in your play today?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: The wind was definitely out there, but I wouldn't say it did a whole lot.  It just a little bit extra (wind interference) on a lot of shots.   
 Q.  A lot of crowd support there.  What was that like playing out here at Highland Meadows?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, the crowds out here are great.  They were great last year.  It's fun to be out here and have everyone out here cheering us on.   
 Q.  Going into the final round, what's your focus?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I would say probably just going out there and playing my game.  Not worry about what everyone else is doing.  Just play my game.   
 Q.  Now that you've transitioned from amateur to pro, do you gain a sense of any more pressure?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Not really.  Honestly, no.  You're out here playing against the same people, so no.   
 Q.  How much credit goes to your caddie/boyfriend on this round?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, we talk on every shot.  He definitely helped me out.  It's nice to have someone out there to keep it loose, too.   
 Q.  Jennifer, you're a trailblazer for what you did at Augusta National.  Great to have you here in Toledo.  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Thank you.   
 Q.  What do you think you'll have to do tomorrow?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, obviously you have to go low.  You have to go low every day, and I didn't quite go low enough today.   
But just go out there and hit greens and hopefully putts will fall.
