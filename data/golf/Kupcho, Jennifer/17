Q. Coming back to the Marathon Classic, what kind of memories do you have from here, the site of your best finish on the LPGA?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, obviously my dad caddied so it was a lot of fun.  I mean, I was playing really well and just out there.  I love this course.  I mean, just pulling in yesterday I was like, Wow, this feels so natural, versus going up to every other LPGA event and you're like, where am I going, where is this, what do I do?
So it definitely feels more natural and I've been here before, so that's nice.
Q. How big of a factor is that for you just feeling comfortable, even just knowing where the driving range is and things like that?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I think it's huge because it really is hard an a rookie because you don't know where everything is and you have to ask so many questions.
So it's definitely more comforting, and I kind of know what all is going on.
Q. You're a couple events through your rookie year.  How do you think it's going so far?  Where do you see your game right now?
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I mean, I'm playing well.  Coming out of Augusta I was definitely struggling with my swing a little bit, but I took an off week two weeks ago so I'm pretty excited from that.  My swing has gotten a lot better since then, so I'm excited to see how it'll go.
