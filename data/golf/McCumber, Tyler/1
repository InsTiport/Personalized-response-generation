Q. Let's talk about today, a 66, another great round for you, and I think highlighted by that 50-footer for eagle at 15.  You have two eagles now this week, the only player to do that.  Pretty good stuff.
TYLER McCUMBER:   Yeah, absolutely.  I had to kind of hit a high soft driver in there because it was downwind, kind of playing firm, as well, and I hit the driver just right how I imagined it, landed soft, kind of near that front, I think just short, bounced up, and obviously from that distance you're just trying to get the speed perfect, and I happened to get the line, as well.
Q. I love it when you hit a high soft driver and the hole is like 325.  That's pretty good stuff.  What is the key for you right now, after the second place last week, you're continuing to play well.  Sometimes that's hard to carry over.  What have you discovered in your game right now?
TYLER McCUMBER:   Yeah, obviously last week takes a lot of energy out of you, in a good way, so always I've noticed it is kind of tricky the next week navigating sort of energy and focus.  But I tried to enjoy it but not ride the high too much in regards to getting energy back and focus for this week.
Q. Still work to do, though; you need another good round tomorrow to complete another great week.
TYLER McCUMBER:   Yeah, absolutely, a lot of work left.  The course is getting so perfect.  The greens are probably the best greens I've ever putted on.  Obviously come out and stay patient and aggressive and kind of just try to do the same thing I did today, make a lot of birdies.
Q. You're a Florida kid; these Bermuda greens, this is what you like, right?
TYLER McCUMBER:   Definitely used to the surfaces, especially the rough.  They have the rough up this week to where you're kind of in between whether it jumps or not, whereas sometimes when it's thicker it almost plays to where you know it's going to come out muffled.  Here it's a little bit more of a guessing game.  I think growing up on these, anyone who's grown up on Bermuda definitely has an upper hand because there is some grain in the rough.
