Q.   Great round.   Your reactions?
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah.   I played really solid today.   The main thing for me is just getting the putter going.   It's just been over the barrel with the putter this year.   But otherwise I hit it great today, and I putted exceptionally well.

Q.   Yeah, you said this course suits your game.   I mean how was the long hitting?   Was it front of the fairway, middle of the fairways or just accurate play today?
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah, I mean I just played solid today, I mean hit it long and just the only real mistake.   I made double there, and otherwise I played well.

Q.   You're two off the lead going into tomorrow.   When you started the day, is that pretty much ‑‑ the bottom of the leading, that's pretty much where you wanted to be, I assume. 
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah, for sure.   There's still three days to go.   I just gotta ball the net and just see what happens each hole and day by day and see what happens from there. 

Q.   Well, good luck. 
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Thank you.
