Q.   You're currently in third position.   Doesn't look like that's going to change.   Could I have your reaction?
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   You know, I played fantastic this week.   I'm really happy the way I played.   I mean I struck the ball good, putting was good, and it was unfortunate about my double on 9 today, but you know what, I've had a great week, so I'm really happy.

Q.   I said to Becky Morgan as well, she's been consistent throughout the week, and apart from one slightly iffy round, I think you've done the same thing.   Consistency must be exactly what you strive for as a golfer. 
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah, definitely.   The only kind of okay bad today was 73 on the second day. 
But you know, you're bound to have an average round in four rounds of golf, and as I said, I'm happy the way that it's turned out this week.

Q.   And to do so well in such an important tournament, you must start the season to win now?
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah.   I want it to carry on.   It would be great to, but it'll be nice to go home for Christmas and new year and all of that and just be with family.

Q.   The next year you can really kick off?
STACY LEE BREGMAN:   Yeah, definitely.   I'm really looking forward to next year, put some good preparation in over my summer, because I'm from South Africa, and yeah, I'm really looking forward to the 2012 season.
