 Q. You put some pressure on Tiger, birdied 12, 13 and 14. Nice round. 
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. I had a good round there on the Back 9. I wasn't striking the ball well on the Front 9, put some pressure on my own Front 9. 
 But you know what, I played good. I played 10 and 12 real well and gave me some calmness and confidence throughout the Back 9. You know, I was very pleased with my second place finish this week, and you know what, I had a lot of good play, and there was a few little goof ups, but that's golf, and I'm excited about, you know, our week off and ready for the PGA. 

 Q. Absolutely. Should throw some confidence up for Hazeltine for you. Thanks very much. Are you happy with the way you played today?
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. I started on the Front 9. I didn't drive the ball well, and you know, I think I turned 1-over, you know. 
 And then I played 10 and 12 real well and found some confidence and calmness and felt good on the Back 9 coming down the stretch.

 Q. Is it a case of maybe getting it going a little bit too late considering how far back you were?
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. I knew that I needed something in the 60s today because I knew Tiger wasn't laying down, and he played really well again today and looks like winning the golf tournament. But you know what, it's a great run. I enjoyed it, I enjoyed myself playing this week, and it gives me good confidence for the PGA.

 Q. Best finish of the year. What worked for you this week as a whole?
 JOHN SENDEN: You know, I putted a lot better than I had been throughout, and you know, I felt better about myself, and I felt that it was a good golf course for me. It played firm and bouncy, and that's what we like, and that's what we're kind of used to back in Australia as well, so I think that overall, you know, second place finish, I'm ecstatic, and really excited about PGA.
