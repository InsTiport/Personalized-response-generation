  Q.  You guys just kind of started feeding each other after No. 2.   
 JOHN SENDEN:  Exactly.  We got off to a hot start and almost continued on the whole way through.  It was a good day for scoring, a little bit of light rain.  The golf course is playing a little softer today, no breeze at all.  I think there's room for good scores out there today.   
  
  Q.  How long does it take you guys to adjust knowing that Thursday and Friday the greens were so hard and so fast, and then you get that rain --   
 JOHN SENDEN:  Yeah, I think the golf course has gotten progressively easier as the week has gone on because when we practiced on Tuesday it was really dry and bouncy, and Pro-Am the same.  Then Thursday afternoon was windy and really dried out.  It was tough on Thursday.   
 But as the wind has dropped off, a little bit of moisture back on the ground.  I think you're going to see good scores on the weekend, and hopefully tomorrow is another day like that.   
  
  Q.  Great finish there on 18.  Tell me about that third shot in.   
 JOHN SENDEN:  Yeah, it was great.  I hit a poor drive off the tee and hit one straight into the trap.  I could only just 8-iron it out.  I was probably maybe 145 yards to the hole, and tried to just hit a little 9-iron just short of the hole, and it just skipped up to the pin and nearly went in.  I couldn't believe it missed because it was only this far behind the hole, right behind it.  I was happy with the result on the last.   
  
  Q.  It's always good to finish with a birdie, makes lunch taste all the more tasty.  What are you going to do the rest of the day?   
 JOHN SENDEN:  I'm going to work on a few little things, especially short game, keep it smooth, and I'm looking forward to another great day tomorrow.
