  Q. Obviously a great start with eagle on the 1st?   
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. That was a good day.   
  
  Q. Back 9 kind of --  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. Looked a little bit messy from my 7 on I lost a little momentum through 7 and 8, and then you know, I played well.   
 I thought I hung in there well. I got a little bit of momentum back on No. 12, 13 and 14. So that was good.   
 And then, unfortunately, I got stuck in the rough on 15. But you know what, it was a good day, and I'm just going to go out there and do the same thing tomorrow and knock them in like Tiger Woods does.   
  
  Q. And still within rank. It's not like you're --  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. I'm just going to go in there and need to stay focused tomorrow on what I do best, and that's -- I've been enjoying myself better out there on the golf course, and that's been making me not try as hard, I guess you could call it.   
 But feeling relaxed has been the key to me, especially on the greens. I've putted better. And you know what, just go out there tomorrow and be done. Anything can happen.  
  
  Q. You've got a great edge. Keep it going.   
 JOHN SENDEN: Appreciate it.
