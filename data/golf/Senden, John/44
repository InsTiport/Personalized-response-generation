  Q. Great round of golf for you.   
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah, it felt good out there. You know, today was a pretty good start. I mean we had a little bit of rain which we had to deal with, but you know, kicked off from yesterday and it was a good day.  
  
  Q. This golf course was already playing a little bit soft. Did the shower that moved through even soften it even more and you could be very aggressive?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. You could be aggressive all day. I mean the golf course was soft yesterday, a little bit of showers this morning, so was able to shoot at flags.   
 You know, some flags on the edge of a couple of slopes. I mean the tee is. And I mean you had to be sort of smart on some and pretty aggressive on others.  
  
  Q. You had late-early tee times. Do you enjoy that momentum that you can carry with you from Thursday on into the second round?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. We have to be aggressive all week here. I think there's low scoring out there, and you have to go out there and shoot the best score you can because everyone is going to go low.  
  
  Q. Sometimes greens get a little spiky when you get some moisture in them. Seems like they're still rolling well.   
 JOHN SENDEN: They're rolling well this morning. We had the best of them this morning out there early, and I'm sure on the weekend they'll be in great shape.  
  
  Q. Have a good weekend.   
 JOHN SENDEN: All right.
