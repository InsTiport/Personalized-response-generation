 Q.   Just a quick comment on you're 30, in 30, out 30.   How much is that on your mind right now?  
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, now that I'm done, it's like there's nothing I can do now.   I mean, I had my chances this week to finish better, and even today I was off to a good start and kind of let it go a little bit coming in.   
You know, it's tough just being here and letting other guys handle your future.   But I can't control that now, so got just to wait and see.  
   
 Q.   What are you actually going to wait here?   
JOHN SENDEN:   No, I'm all packed up and I'm going to fly tonight at like 7:00, so I'll be out of here within the hour.   Yeah, so we'll just see how it works out.  
   
 Q.   Are you kind of up in the air as far as a fall schedule?  
JOHN SENDEN:   I might play Las Vegas tournament, yeah, and then Malaysia, HSBC, and then we've got two in Australia, Australian Open and PGA in December.   Yeah, so hopefully we'll wait and see, and hopefully it works out in my favor.   There's lots of guys out there doing well.   
But the finish is very odd.   The finish to the golf course is pretty volatile, so it'll be interesting coming down the stretch.   The front nine is gettable, the back nine‑‑ there's some tough holes on the back, especially coming home, the last three.   Just got to wait and see.  
   
 Q.   Literally one minute you could be 31, one minute you could be 29.   Do you just kind of do your best to wait until the end of the day?   I'm curious myself how you go about looking at that.   
JOHN SENDEN:   As I said to you before, I can't do anything about it.   I'm done.   I can't control that.   I mean, the fellas on the golf course know what's happening, but I think that there's less pressure on me now, now that I'm done, than on the guys on the golf course.   Hopefully it works out my way.
