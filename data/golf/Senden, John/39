 Q. An opening round 2-under par 68, you must be delighted with the start?
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah, I'm delighted. I played really nicely today. Struck the ball well off the tee and got a nice couple of birdies early in the round. Birdies on 3 and 5 kind of kick started the day, and drove the ball nicely. These greens are tough to putt on, fastest bermudagreens I've ever seen. So as I said earlier in the week, it's like they are on steroids. But no, a comfortable day and tried to let it go all the way to the end. 
 I did that and that's the challenge for the next three days as you go deeper into the tournament, it's more difficult. I have to continue on.

 Q. You were bogey-free right until the very last hole, just an indication of just how tough this golf course is. 
 JOHN SENDEN: It is. You've got to drive the ball real well and as you know the fairways are perfect out there. Bermudagreens, you've really got to be coming out of the short stuff. Like the last four holes, they are tough. 
 And the 18th hole, you've only got to hit your driver off five yard -- left is water which is no good, but on the right side, if you're in the trap, it's very, very difficult to reach the green in two if you drive it in the trap, which is what I did on 18. But I managed to up-and-down it.
