Q.   You're known as a great ball striker on the PGA TOUR and the stats proved that again today, heading into the weekend in contention.   Give me your opinion on the first two rounds of this tournament. 
JOHN SENDEN:   I believe the golf course is playing exceptionally well.   The greens were receptive this morning.   It's the first time I've played Bethpage, and I feel like it suits my game.   It's a strong golf course, and you've got to drive the ball well to put yourself in position to attack the greens.   You've got to have an allâ€‘around game, especially on a major championship golf course, and I think that so far, so good.   Hopefully keep going on the weekend. 

Q.   How different was the golf course, if at all, this morning compared to Thursday?   Was it a little more receptive as far as the setup goes?
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, I played yesterday afternoon, and I feel like the greens dried out considerably over the morning.   The greens were probably a foot or two feet faster than they were this morning.   The golf course is out there for the taking this morning.   If you're driving the ball well, I feel like you can get it, and you have to just play solid all around to shoot a good score.
