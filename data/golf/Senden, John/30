Q.   Well done today, 1â€‘under making the turn, and then you birdie 11, 12, 13, nice birdie at the last, or on the front nine.   You made those birdies in a row.   Talk about your day. 
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, I got off to a good start.   I birdied on 11, and so it was a nice birdie there.   A couple little mistakes here and there today. 
You know, No. 15 and 18 today, but bounced back pretty well on the front nine, my second nine holes.   I've been feeling good with my ball striking and my putting over the last week or so.   Doral was good. 

Q.   You like this place, a couple of seconds here.   Somebody had a stat that other than people that have won this event, you have won more money here than anybody. 
JOHN SENDEN:   I like this place.   It shapes well off the tee.   You know, you've really got to work hard off the tee with shaping golf shots, because some of the holes tilt different ways.   It's a fun golf course to play.   I really love coming here.   It's always nine times out of ten we have beautiful weather.   Looking forward to the challenge of the rest of the week.

Q.   You've played well at Humana, you talked about last week, pretty good match play, what's been the key for you so far the first three months? 
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, I really changed a lot around with my short game right around the PGA last year.   And I felt good in Atlanta, and then I took it into the Playoffs, and I've been feeling good since probably right around that time.   I really wanted to continue to improve in my belief in myself, and I feel like I've got the game and it's about being able to get out there and stand on the stage and accept that you're one of those guys that can win.   So I have to keep working hard on those issues and hopefully that can put me in good stead for hopefully a victory soon.
