Q.   How tough was it out there today, and was it different than it was the first two days?
JOHN SENDEN:   Definitely when we teed off today, it was pretty windy.   I just had to go out there and play my game, go out there and just be in my little process that I'm doing all the time.   Yeah, the golf course was‑‑ if you hit good shots, you could actually get the course, but if you're in the wrong spots it's very difficult up‑and‑downs, the greens are getting harder and faster.   But it's a tough day for everybody, and looking forward to the challenge again tomorrow. 

Q.   When you start the day in a position where a couple of guys have separated themselves, does that alleviate some pressure?   Does it add some pressure?
JOHN SENDEN:   Yeah, I think those guys are going in with the pressure tomorrow.   If they get into the clubhouse with the lead, 13, 12, whatever their scores are right now, I believe that it's up to those two guys to almost fight it out tomorrow.   But look, I just have to play my game.   If I play as well as I did today, I'm a chance to try and be in there in the mix.

Q.   It's not just today, it's been one heck of a year.   What do you attribute that to?   You've been a great player for a long time.   You're a cagy old veteran now. 
JOHN SENDEN:   Yeah.   I think high belief is one issue.   I've been going out there, out here for quite a while now, and I believe that I just lacked that little bit.   I'm learning to stand on the stage, and ever since the John Deere Classic that I won in '06, that really catapulted me up to a level that I can do this, and then the Valspar Championship was another icing on the cake to know that I can still do it.   But these bigger and better events, the major championships, this week at THE PLAYERS, we have to really dig deep to get it done here, and it's a much different feeling.
