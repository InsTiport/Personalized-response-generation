  JOHN SENDEN:   Sluggish start today.   2 down early in the match, and I was always behind.   I needed to really sort of turn things around, especially‑‑ I did that through nine holes and got back into the match.   And just a bit of the gift on 16.   The 5‑footer was over on 17, but he missed that putt so it gave me a chance.   Could have been anyone on that last hole there.   It's okay.   Learn from it.  
   
 Q.   Anything special that worked today?  
JOHN SENDEN:   I didn't drive the ball well enough.   From the couple of times on that front nine earlier in the round, I wasn't putting myself in the best position to attack the pins and coming out of the rough and the bunkers.   And then after about six or seven holes, I started to drive the ball quite well and I drove the ball well on the back nine, so I was happy with that.  
And my boy, he just‑‑ he was solid all day.   He swung it well.  
   
 Q.   What do you take away from this?  
JOHN SENDEN:   I haven't had very much experience in match play, so I've got to be happy to come away with a couple of victories this week.   I haven't played any Presidents Cup teams or match play tournaments.   I just had one go at this tournament about four years ago and lost in the first round.   So I've got to take my game to Doral.
