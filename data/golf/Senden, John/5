 Q.   You knew your fate coming in, but still good to come out here and compete.   Looking forward to tomorrow?   
JOHN SENDEN:   I am looking forward to tomorrow.   I had to stay aggressive today and stay in the mindset so I'm able to stay in the mode, I guess you call it, to be in the right frame of mind for tomorrow.   I'm glad I did that.   Keeps my mental side bright.  
   
 Q.   Still undefeated.   You will need that tomorrow.   Hunter is playing really well.   He's obviously a great match play player, having won this event.   I don't think it changes your strategy necessarily?  
JOHN SENDEN:   No.   I feel like with the matches I've had, I feel like I need to bring out my A game instead of my B+ game.   I think that we've begun to realize the deeper you get into the tournament, the better players you play.   You've got to play great to advance.   
Tomorrow is knockout, so I'm going to give it my best shot.
