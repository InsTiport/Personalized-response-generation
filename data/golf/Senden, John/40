 Q. It's worth getting up early for, isn't it? 
 JOHN SENDEN: It was an early start. The alarm went off at 4:40, I think it was. Pick up at 5:00 o'clock, and came out here and it was a beautiful morning. 
 It was quite cool when we first arrived. When the sun came up, it was a fantastic day. When we got through nine or ten holes, it started to blow a little bit. The last nine holes were definitely more difficult.

 Q. Did the wind change much? It seems like it's blowing in a slightly different position?
 JOHN SENDEN: A little bit. I think yesterday we had a north breeze. Today we've got a little bit of an easterly breeze, I think, northeast. And some of the holes like 11 and 2 played quite easy yesterday, whereas today they're a little bit across. 
 There's not really a lot of advantage with this particular breeze on all the holes you run across. Yesterday it was the north breeze and par-5s played down. So it was a good day. It's not easy out there.

 Q. Well, I've seen you in Japanese restaurants for many years out on the PGA TOUR. Whenever I go into Japanese, it seems like you like Japanese. This week what trips do you have downtown? 
 JOHN SENDEN: We he haven't been out a lot. But I've been heading over to that Drago's at the Hilton Hotel. We've been having a few of those charbroiled oysters. They're great. And last night I had the Acme Oyster House who sponsors the event. Had that last night. Been getting around a little bit and enjoying New Orleans.

 Q. Well, you get to walk a lot, so you can walk it off the next two or three days. 
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah, exactly. Get in the gym and work it off. It's all good.
