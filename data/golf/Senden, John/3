Q.   Hunter Mahan has a terrific record in this tournament.   He hasn't been behind for one hole this whole week. 
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, he had control of the match on the first holes.   And he was a couple up.   And then I had some birdies on the middle of the back nine which turned the momentum. 
I stuck to my game plan.   I stayed aggressive, stayed on my play.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JOHN SENDEN:   You can think like that if you want to, but you have to choose to stay strong and aggressive because you know he's hitting great shots all the time.   If you could just keep on your game plan to try to get it close you can‑‑ anyone can be beaten.   I just feel that I just keep playing well, and who knows where it will end up.

Q.   You haven't been in the best of form recently.   Four missed cuts in the last five.   Did you feel it coming this week?   What's the difference?
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, I did some great work with my coach from Australia about‑‑ for about a month.   And he was in Augusta and we did some work in New Orleans and I felt like it was coming around. 
I've been striking the ball well.   The body hasn't behaved as well as I would have liked to during the year but I feel like I'm going to go out there and just be aggressive and stick to my plan.   I think that I can keep turning it around.
