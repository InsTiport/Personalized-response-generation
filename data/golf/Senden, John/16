Q.   3â€‘under 67, your thoughts on today's round.
JOHN SENDEN:   Well, it was upanddown, kind of right through the middle of my round.   You know, got off to a rough start in regards to my ball striking.   I didn't hit my greens, but I made a couple of real good saves and held it together through nine holes, and then I started to sort of try to be patient with myself on the middle of the Back 9 it started to turn around. 
So a bit of a rally on the last few holes to finish inside the top 10, and I was happy with my performance and where I finished.

Q.   I'm sure a lot to build on for the weeks to come.
JOHN SENDEN:   Yeah, I am.   I'm in next week's Mayakoba and leading up to the Australian Open Championship.   Heading home for that.   So this has given me a fair bit of confidence to go home and play well in Australia.

Q.   Safe travels.   Play well.
