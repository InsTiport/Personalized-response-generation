  Q. Were you aware of your position?   
 JOHN SENDEN: I didn't really look at the leaderboards much, but yeah, I knew I had to shoot -- I knew I had to keep up with what my plans were to give me a chance.   
  
  Q. You guys don't usually have the second tournament within a tournament thing. Good format, or they should stay with the format?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah, it's fine.  
  
  Q. Is it hard not having all the information out there, knowing you have to do this or that to definitely get in?  
 JOHN SENDEN: I didn't really know what I had to do. You know, I thought I had to Top 10 to do it, and I probably needed that. Yeah, so I'll deal with it.
