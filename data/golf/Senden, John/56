  Q. 64. What was it that was just working well on your game today.  
 JOHN SENDEN: The first three rounds I just felt pretty good out there. I was going pretty good.   
 The storm this morning, I got two birdies on the back-9. That helped me. I birdied 5 and 6 and that was fine, and four birdies on the back-9 in a row, you know, I was pleased to have them and the last two holes were good, just felt good.  
  
  Q. Actually the Byron Nelson a final round a few weeks ago you did well. What is it about the final round?  
 JOHN SENDEN: It's one of those things. When you're feeling good about yourself and you're hitting it well and sometimes the putts go in and you get on a roll, why not keep it going? Hopefully keep it up.  
  
  Q. How do you prepared for the Open, how do you judge it?  
 JOHN SENDEN: What I'm planning to do is wait until I actually get in the tournament. I do understand I would like to play the golf course. Hopefully, it will work out. I'm feeling good about my game. I'm glad to get there. Played the U.S. Open at Shinnecock. I'm glad to be there.  
  
  Q. Just on standby.  
 JOHN SENDEN: Just on standby. You never know. It might work out.
