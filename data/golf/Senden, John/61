 Q.  John, a much different beast of a golf course out there today. 
 JOHN SENDEN:  Yeah, you know what, when we started the day today we felt that we were just going to get so wet out there.  They had predicted two to four inches of rain, I guess.  And when we warmed up it started to become blue skies.  The day progressively got better and better, but the golf course is playing really difficult, especially difficult to get close because it's soft greens.  I think with the wind up, it's a tough test of golf, and I just tried to enjoy myself and got the job done. 

 Q.  Was it difficult to get ready because you're thinking to yourself, okay, I'm going to have to be ready to throw all my rain gear on, so I'm going to warm up with the rain gear and do everything in the rain gear, and then you see blue sky, and you're like, I need to find out where the weather man lives because now I've got to go kick his butt? 
 JOHN SENDEN:  Exactly.  The weather men haven't got it right all week this week.  But you know what, we just tried to prepare for the elements, and you've just got to do what you've got to do.  Today when we warmed up we sort of had all the gear on and then we started peeling it off.  My caddie's bag weighs about 400 pounds, so he's struggling to get around. 
 But we just have to do what we've got to do.  It's just a matter of preparing properly and going out and doing your job. 

 Q.  Well, your caddie is going to get an IV.  It looks like you're going to get a nice little Top 10 this week.  He gets an IV, you get a Top 10.  Well played.  We'll see you out there. 
 JOHN SENDEN:  Good.  Thanks for having me.
