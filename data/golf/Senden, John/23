 Q.   5‑under par 66, told round of golf, bogey‑free.   Was it that solid out there?  
JOHN SENDEN:   Look, I've been seeing them well.   Last week I felt good and wanted to bring that same form into the Deutsche Bank here this week.   Today was another good day.   I felt like I drove it well and actually been feeling good more on and around the greens, so that's been the difference from my low score today.   
   
 Q.   We had heavy rains early in the week and the course is starting to dry out a little bit.   Today was really the day to get it because it looks like it's going to be pretty dry this week, and this place can dry out pretty quick.   
JOHN SENDEN:   I think this golf course gives up a few birdies compared to what it was like last week.   I believe if you go out there and hit great shots all day, you've got good chances.   I think the fairways and greens will be generous.   I think, yes, it will get dry and it will get fast, the course, but I think the golf course is in such great shape that it can‑‑ you can shoot low scores out there still with the wind.  
   
 Q.   The fairways are generous but you really need to be‑‑ the greens, the way they sit on the angles, and when they do firm up, a little tougher to get it to the hole, but when you hit it in the fairways, you've got angles to play to and work the ball and get it close; is that correct?   
JOHN SENDEN:   You can.   Look, if you drive the ball well and in the correct positions, like if you drive it down that 18th hole in the perfect spot, you're thinking a 4.   I believe that obviously the golf course today was soft enough that if you drive it well to get it to those tight pins and get some birdies out there.
