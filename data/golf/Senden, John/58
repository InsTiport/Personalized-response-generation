  Q. You got close at the end there.   
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah. I started the day trying to get to double figures, and I felt like I was playing well, got off to a good start today, mediocre in the middle of my round, but I felt like it's coming around and made an eagle and a birdie, and it was good.   
  
  Q. 16 just kind of sent you flying?  
 JOHN SENDEN: It did, yeah. I played that hole well, a driver and a 4-iron right onto the green, and I holed the putt. Felt really good about myself today, so just need to continue to do that.  
  
  Q. Is there less pressure when you're coming from behind like that, trying to catch those guys?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Well, I guess there is in a way because you're not holding the lead or not right around the lead at the start of the day. Obviously if you're leading the golf tournament you're probably the guy with the most pressure. Coming from behind is a little easier situation, finishing earlier in the day. But I think that there's more pressure on you to try to catch that guy in the lead. So that's golf.   
  
  Q. Are you in Colonial, as well?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Yeah.  
  
  Q. The combination of two tournaments, just going down the highway, how convenient is that for you?  
 JOHN SENDEN: Well, we live here, so we love it here. 25 minutes to TPC here, and about 35 minutes to Colonial, so looking forward to -- it's a great event here this week, and looking forward to next week, as well.
