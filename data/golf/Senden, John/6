 Q.   As you head into Saturday and Sunday, does your mindset change at all?  
JOHN SENDEN:   Every player is different.   Whenever you get deeper into the tournament, there's more pressure.   Just got to go out there and play my game, stay aggressive and hopefully knock a few birdies in and put the pressure on.  
   
 Q.   Pleased to go through, obviously.   
JOHN SENDEN:   We are set up to feel like our match is means nothing tomorrow, but I'm going to reserve the energy tomorrow and Brendon Todd is a world class player and we're good friends.   Go out there and just prepare on the golf course and have another good look at it and get ready for Saturday morning.  
   
 Q.   How do you balance trying to stay sharp but not expending too much energy?  
JOHN SENDEN:   I still feel like I can handle it out there.   I'm going to go out there and play like I did the last couple of years and be strongly aggressive, but don't let it knock my momentum if I win or lose.  
   
 Q.   When is the last time you played 36, 36 on the weekend?   
JOHN SENDEN:   A long time ago.   I'll be happy to do it, too.   I just need to keep going out there and playing my game.   Be strong and just‑‑ it's anyone's game.   
   
 Q.   You are obviously a fan of this new format?  
JOHN SENDEN:   It's worked in my favor so far.   It's great to see the best players in the world playing three rounds of golf, too.   A good format with that.   I'm sure the sponsors love it.   Cadillac has been great sponsors.   They are happy to see the best players come out and play all three days.
