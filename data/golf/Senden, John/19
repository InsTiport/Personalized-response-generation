Q.   (No Microphone.)
JOHN SENDEN:   Yeah, yeah, well, I actually made a comment last year, I thought that if it was going to be soft, I thought that this course would be get able.   But not with the cold conditions.   It seems to be really holding up really well.   And shooting a par round today is, I'm very happy with it. 

Q.   Question about today, splitting up a round like this, does it alter approach or do you just do what you plan to do and just do it over two days?
JOHN SENDEN:   I just got to just plan what I do.   We have done this before, we have had delay, so we approach it the best way we can with the delays, be patient with the logistics of the event and then just go about my business professionally.

Q.   Cold weather make a difference right now?
JOHN SENDEN:   The course is playing a little longer for the cold weather.
