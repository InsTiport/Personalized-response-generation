Q. How long have you been working with Scotty?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   Probably about a year and a half now.  Went back to the Korn Ferry, after first five events I started with him on the Korn Ferry last year.
Q. So at what point in his round do you think that something like this was possible?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   The last putt.  As I was telling him, I never -- I always struggle with what the actual par was.  I just try and -- that's the best result we can do.
Q. Seemed to be a shot by shot mentality?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   Definitely.  He never looks ahead.
Q. Coming down the stretch, he had that tough par look on 17.  Was there a lot of talk between you guys over the putt?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   On the par one?  Not a lot.  He was in great spirits.  It was just a matter of picking the right line and hitting the putt.  We just talked about the right line and that was it.
Q. What were you seeing as far as picking irons, picking lines, that kind of thing?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   He just did everything normal, you know what I mean.  Got a really good bounce on hole No. 9, actually.  It went left and kicked back to the middle of the green and made a good putt.  You know you're going to have a good day when things like that happen.
Q. Now that it's over, you can say you caddied for somebody that shot a 59.  What do you think about that?
SCOTT McGINNESS:   Yeah, that's pretty awesome.  As a caddie you're only as good as your player.  I've obviously got a good one.
