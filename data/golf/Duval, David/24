  Q. 3-under 68, obviously not the way you wanted to finish, but do you still feel pretty good about today?  
 DAVID DUVAL: Yeah, I played mostly okay. I didn't feel so great the back nine. Body didn't feel very good. I was hurting a little bit. I kind of struggled physically on that nine, but just manage to get around.  
  
  Q. What specifically was hurting, the back?  
 DAVID DUVAL: Yeah, I just was getting kind of tight, cold, kind of wet. Just wears on you after a while. That's all.
