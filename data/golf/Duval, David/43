Q.
David, you hit the ball well the last few holes.
DAVID DUVAL:  I hit the ball pretty decent all day, just made a couple bad mistakes.  If you do that out here, you shoot a few over par.
Q.  What were your expectations today?
DAVID DUVAL:  High.  They were very high.  You know, I'm playing good golf, I've just got to do it out on the golf course.
Q.  You lipped out two putts coming down the stretch, but the eagle at 16, does that give you motivation going into tomorrow?
DAVID DUVAL:  I'm not looking for that for motivation.  I have my own motivations and I know how I'm playing, and I just want to do it like I know how.

I know all the work I've done has paid off and I'm hitting the ball great, I've just got to go do it.
Q.  A successful round now, is it determined by the way you hit the ball, or is it score?
DAVID DUVAL:  There's certainly a little of both.  Golf is about scoring, nothing else.  But when you've been working on some things and making some changes, it takes a little while and you lose the scoring.  My wedge game probably isn't as sharp as it could be, and I always feel like I could putt better.

So, you know, I'm real pleased with what's going on, and I just know that -- I know I'll be playing really, really well here soon.  Thanks.
