 Q.  Obviously a great performance, your best performance in years here at The Open.  Can you describe some of the emotions you're going through?  DAVID DUVAL: Well, as we stand here right now, I have sheer disappointment, because I didn't think I had a chance to win the golf tournament starting out today.  I just wanted to put up a good score.  Conditions were difficult for sure, and the thing I'm just sad about is that I played better than my score.  I'd have liked to have gotten kind of my 70 out of it, I should have, 69, 70, 71 I should have, not my 73.  That's disappointing, but all in all, yeah, it's been a wonderful, wonderful week.  I was in control, hit the golf ball well, and so it was nice to do that.   Q.  Going into this tournament did you realistically see yourself not only just making the cut but really making a strong push yesterday?  DAVID DUVAL: Yeah, just with the practice I've been doing and work, there's been a lot of instances where I've felt like I'm really close to doing exactly what I want to do on the golf course, and just sometimes did it, sometimes didn't.  But in general, just got that much more comfortable this week and that much more confident in what I was doing, and felt like I was in complete control.  Like I said yesterday, I like controlling the golf ball, and even today on a tough day, I did a pretty good job of it.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  DAVID DUVAL: I don't know.  Sure, I'd like to play a few more times, but it's not up to me.  It's up to -- my status is of no use, and then it's just trying to get into a few tournaments when I can.  I don't know, I'll just take it for what it is this week and go from there.
