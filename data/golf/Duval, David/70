DAVID DUVAL:   Well, I played real good again.  A couple  -- a couple times when, you know, I felt like I had a good opportunity to make a birdie from the fairway and I make a bogey, and that just kind of killed me.  Just couldn't get past 4.  I really felt like I was close to shooting a good score but just didn't materialize. 
 
Q.  How about that putt on 18?  Was it just a little fast? 
 
DAVID DUVAL:   I don't know.  It looked pretty good to me.  Just didn't go in.  
 
The putt on 18, maybe 20 feet.  
 
Q.  Kind of ripe for the taking today and you didn't take it? 
 
DAVID DUVAL:   Well, I feel like I could have shot a better score yesterday and I could have shot a better score today.  I don't know if that means I feel like I'm ripe for the taking or not.  I certainly walked away both days feeling like I left a shot of shots out there.
