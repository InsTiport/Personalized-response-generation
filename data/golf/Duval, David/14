  Q. Just some general comments. How does it feel to be back after last year?  
 DAVID DUVAL: That has no bearing on my feelings for being here. I just love playing here; I love being here. I think it's a great tournament. An important week.  
  
  Q. How is your game right now?   
 DAVID DUVAL: It's really good. I think I'm playing well. Wish my score had been slightly better. I think they could have been this year so far.  
 All in all, I feel great about what I'm doing.   
  
  Q. Is there something you're working on more so than others? What's going right?   
 DAVID DUVAL: No. I feel great about everything. Every aspect, of all I'm trying to do, I feel good about. Just week in week out just trying to chip it better and wedge it better.  
  
  Q. You get to play a full schedule this year. Have you thought that far in advance about the schedule?  
 DAVID DUVAL: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be very similar to what it always is. Kind of the typical places I always play.
