Q.
Progressing through the round were you thinking differently, going for a score or is it just one of those things, I can play every day?
DAVID DUVAL:  Not so much thinking of a score, if anything, just try and make more and more birdies, that's all.  I'm not one to sit there and try it hold onto a score.  Just try to get as low as I can.
Q.  Is it fair to say you never let off the pedal today?
DAVID DUVAL:  Sure tried not to.  I was forced to play some smarter shots at times.  15, I sure wanted to hit it at that flag out of the rough, some other holes where I just wanted to be a little more aggressive but I couldn't.

Just take what I had and as aggressive as I could be.
Q.  A couple good pars    inaudible?
DAVID DUVAL:  Yes and no.  The answer is yes and no.  Just played solid, not make mistakes, but at the same time, I'm not as concerned with bogeys, can't be upset with anything.
Q.  Swinging hard?
DAVID DUVAL:  When I want to.  Certainly not trying to hold back at all.
