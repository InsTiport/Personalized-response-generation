   DAVID DUVAL: There is one thing I'm working on, trying to fight my swing. I have gotten a little bit long in the driver. In the rough here, you are in bad shape. You can't much play on this rough. It cost me a couple bogeys, but all in all a good day. 

 Q. So really the amount on the golf course, it's gettable from the fairway but it is pretty tough from the rough; is it not? 
 DAVID DUVAL: You are not getting any fliers really. And the ball, it's thick rough but it is not so thick -it stills goes right to the bottom. You can't hit it more than 130, -40 yards. 

 Q. What's your thoughts on the golf course the first time around it? 
 DAVID DUVAL: I like the course. I think it is kind of right in front of you. It is a good golf course. It is really well prepped, in great shape. 
You can see with the traffic of 132 people for the first two days in the afternoon, the greens are going to get a little tore up and beat up. I think it will hold up all right.
