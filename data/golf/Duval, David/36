   DAVID DUVAL:  I feel like I'm playing well.  I finished up last year I think for the most part accomplishing my major goals.  My performances were not very good but my biggest thing was get -- (Inaudible.)   
 I think that this off-season has proven to me that I did -- I haven't played golf, I played one round, maybe hit 30 balls and that was it.   
 So I came here and it was a good test.   
  
  Q.  It looks like you're playing more in the comfort zone you used to be comfortable playing in.   
 DAVID DUVAL:  Well, I think that's something that comes with controlling the golf ball.  For lack of another way to put it, you're hitting it the way you want to hit it.  It's a little more comfortable out there when it's going where you want it to.
