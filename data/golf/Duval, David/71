Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DAVID DUVAL:   Wasn't a factor.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the round  --
 
DAVID DUVAL:   I played pretty well.  I hit it close a lot. 
 
Q.  Was it the putter for you today?
 
DAVID DUVAL:   Yeah, I just didn't make any putts.  Kind of like last week.  I don't know why.  I don't know, I just hit bad putts.  Just didn't go in.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about this tournament, being back here  --
 
DAVID DUVAL:   Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I don't know  -- I didn't know it was leaving, you know.  I didn't know it was going away next year for a year.  I don't know what's on the agenda, if it's supposed to return after that.  I think the guy from Seattle says they are taking it out there every four years maybe, and I don't know if that's true or not.  So I can't really answer your question.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DAVID DUVAL:   You all trying to get everybody to lobby to get the tournament back, is that it?    Oh, I love it.  I love it.  I think it's great.  It's stood the test of time.  You haven't had to jack around with it.  You know, you don't see 20-under here, winning scores, at all.  I think it's a lot of fun to come here.  It's nice going to courses that you know that are really, really good.  I would hate to see it disappear, that's for sure.   Yeah, I've missed a lot of fairways before.  I'm just  -- you know, it's no big deal.
