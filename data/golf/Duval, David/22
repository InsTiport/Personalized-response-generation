   DAVID DUVAL: I played really well today. I think today I hit the ball better than I have the first two days. 
 I think I'm in the same boat as most of the other players. Found these greens to be the bumpiest of the three golf courses. They're really, really bad that way.
 But in general, really happy how I played.

 Q. And looking to tomorrow? 
 DAVID DUVAL: Try to think the good tomorrow. There's not a whole a lot to the recipe. Just try to hit in the fairway and give yourself some putts for birdies. 
 The greens being kind of soft and bumpy like they are, some are gonna bounce in and come are gonna will bounce out. 

 Q. Anything that's been working particularly well for you this week?
 DAVID DUVAL: Just driven it pretty well, hit my irons pretty well, and I actually putted real well. You know, like everybody, I've had a lot of putts look like they're going in. Last hole was comical.

 Q. It was a confident putt. 
 DAVID DUVAL: Yeah, but, I mean, it was so funny. Missed the hole by -- God, it was awful, that bounce. Just how it is out here right now.

 Q. Going back over the last few years, when you haven't had success other places you've seem to have done well here. Is there something about these courses? 
 DAVID DUVAL: I like being here a lot. Feel very comfortable here, and just look forward to the event every year. I think it's an important tournament for us as an organization, and try to support it and be here.

 Q. I notice following you a little bit today and watching the Open last year on TV that the gallery is very supportive. Is that typical of the reaction you get?
 DAVID DUVAL: Um, they've been pretty good to me over the last couple years for sure, and it's much appreciated.
