 Q. David, well played. 
 DAVID DUVAL: Thank you. Yeah. I hit the ball pretty good.
 
 Q. And always nice to have some birdies at the end. 
 DAVID DUVAL: Of course. Yeah. It is always good to finish out.

 Q. Any reason why everything has gone so well on this windy Thursday morning? 
 DAVID DUVAL: Well, years of hard work, and I've been playing a lot better this year than my results have shown. 
 I've been playing exponentially better actually, I think. However, I've just gotten nothing out of it so far this year and just been trying to be even more patient, stay the course and keep at it.

 Q. When you get under par and you start rolling like you did in the opening round, do old feelings or memories come back where you know how to take it deeper? 
 DAVID DUVAL: That's not something I think about necessarily or thought about today. I'm just not uncomfortable, so maybe it's something that I'm just comfortable with and grew up doing and used to. 
 And you know, I feel like when you're hitting it well, you play smart, and you just gotta keep it going.

 Q. Okay. Try to keep the momentum up for three more days. 
 DAVID DUVAL: Okay. Thank you.
