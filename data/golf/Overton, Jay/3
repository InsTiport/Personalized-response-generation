Q.  Well, welcome back to Oak Tree.  How does it feel to be back?
JAY OVERTON:  Oh, it feels great to be back to Oklahoma.  I have fond memories here.  But not today.
Q.  What was, what's changed about this course?
JAY OVERTON:  Well, this is the first time I played this course.  We played Quail Creek before.  And Quail Creek was a great golf course, and this is a great golf course.  But it's got a little windy and the greens got a little hard and it was just difficult to get the ball close to the hole.  And it's hard to make birdies.  It's easy to make bogeys.
Q.  What are your expectations for the rest of the week?
JAY OVERTON:  Well, I shot 80 today, but I didn't play that bad, but I scored bad.  But I think I can play the golf course.  We have a nine o'clock tee time tomorrow and if the wind doesn't blow, well maybe we can shoot a good round.
Q.  Do you think playing in the morning will be better for your game?
JAY OVERTON:  Absolutely.  If the wind doesn't blow.  The wind didn't blow this morning, it was nice this morning.  The greens were holding, but the greens this afternoon were like this pavement we're standing on this afternoon.  The ball wouldn't stop.  So if the ball won't stop on these greens, the undulation in them is so severe that the ball is going to kick over the green almost every time.  But it's a great golf course, I love it.
