Q.  Obviously a lot of special memories coming back to a place that you led in the '88 PGA Championship, tell me a little bit about your feelings, did you have any recollections, reflections, as you were playing these two days?
JAY OVERTON:  Well, yeah, I did.  Obviously, no one's ever going to forget the hole in one that Azinger made on number four.  There were a couple holes that they changed a little bit, some of the greens have been changed, but overall, it plays and it looks and feels so much the same.  Hey, the biggest difference this year is the overseeding where the green or the fairways are so thick and soft and the ball's not going as far.  So it's playing pretty long.  Longer than I remembered it.  Of course I'm a little older.
Q.  In the 17 years or 18 years since that time your reflection of your game today, obviously not where you would have liked it to have been, but still it's good to be out here competing at this event at a place that has special memories for you.
JAY OVERTON:  Yeah, I took, I played four years on the Senior Tour and I played a lot of Majors over my career and a lot of TOUR events.  But I went back to work at Innisbrook last January to take over the resort and do what I've been doing for 29 years there and 35 total as a club professional.  That's what I am, and that's what I'll always about.  And said that here in '88.  But I took almost a year away from the game and I kind of wish I hadn't.  I'm struggling a little bit.  But you know what, to get back out here and see the guys and come back to Edmond, Oklahoma, it's just been a lot of fun.  So my family and I have really enjoyed it.  Having my son caddieing for me that's special, and my wife walked every painful step of the way watching that exhibition.  But, no, it was good to be back.
