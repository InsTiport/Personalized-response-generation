Q.   Obviously conditions probably had to be the story of today.
KEVIN NA:   Yeah.   It was cold and windy this morning.   We knew coming in a today, just last night that the weather wasn't looking good and got out here and, you know, I didn't even pack much warm clothes and what I could, and wore as much clothes as I could and try to hang in there today.

Q.   Did it get better as the day went on?
KEVIN NA:   It did.   It did.   It was probably 48 to 50 degrees when we teed off and probably ended high 50s, almost 60 degrees.   The weather, the temperature wise it got better but the wind, yeah, I think it died down maybe three to five mile and hour.   Probably blowing close to 15 right now.   It was blowing close to 20 early in the morning.

Q.   What was going on well for you?
KEVIN NA:   I hit the ball pretty well.   Even though my misses were playable.   They were just off the green.   And I chipped it very well today.   I felt like I had a lot of good putts that didn't go in for birdie but I didn't make any bogies so I was pretty pleased.

Q.   That's kind of what I was asking, give me an overview.
KEVIN NA:   I played solid.   I was telling Mark, my misses were very playable.   I chipped it well and got up and down, everyone of them. 
I felt like I made good putts that didn't go in but, you know, I didn't make any bogs so I was very pleased.

Q.   How about the wind, affect you much?
KEVIN NA:   Yeah.   Two club wind at least, maybe two and a half at times.   It was tough to judge.

Q.   This afternoon, you like where you're at with 1-under?
KEVIN NA:   I think it will stay in the Top 10, probably.   I think the wind is supposed to die down a little bit but I think it's still going to play tough.

Q.   How about all your injuries? 
KEVIN NA:   Knock on wood, it's pretty good.   I mean I went through some good rehab, I had some good people help me and, you know, it's been pretty good this year so far. 
I mean the cold weather, I was feeling a little bit, but nothing too bad, especially coming off three weeks, I'm fresh.

Q.   Did you cringe a little this morning when it was so cold?
KEVIN NA:   I hit 20 balls and went back in the clubhouse.   I'm going to sit here for 20 minutes until the sun comes up.   It was tough this morning.
