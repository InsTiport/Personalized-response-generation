 Q.   Here you are back in Arizona.   You always seem to play well here, hence the nickname "Kevin Arizona."   Just some thoughts on the week.   Obviously got to be pleased with your finish?  
KEVIN NA:   Yeah, got off to a really good start the first round.   Second round I had it going, and when the sun was going down, the sun was in my face on 5, and I couldn't see a thing.   I hit it out of bounds and really threw me off track.   But you know, I've been hitting the ball good all year.   I've only played four tournaments, but I've been hitting it really good.   The putter has been the problem and the short game has been the problem, and that's usually my specialty.   
I figured out my chipping before the week started, and the putter was still shaky, but I changed my grip on the back nine yesterday, and I putter started‑‑ I started making some putts.  
   
 Q.   What did you do different with the grip?  
KEVIN NA:   I went from an overlap to a double overlap, so it's working‑‑ I'm going to keep trying it.   
   
 Q.   You're playing Pebble?  
KEVIN NA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Taking good vibes into Pebble next week?  
KEVIN NA:   Yeah.
