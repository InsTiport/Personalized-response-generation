Q.   Good match.   You find yourself now in a position tomorrow where you've got a chance to advance?
KEVIN NA:   Well, he does got to win.   I don't know what his score was.

Q.   If Hideki wins and you beat him then you have a tie breaker?
KEVIN NA:   I was kind of pulling for Hideki.   I told him this morning good luck because I know when you lose your first match, you kind of have your fate in other people's hands. 
Yesterday was a frustrating loss, I was 2â€‘up with two to go and basically I blew it.   Fortunately, this new format, you can lose the first match and still have a chance to advance like what I did today winning. 
So my mindset, I was really disappointed after the way I lost yesterday.   I told myself, you know what, go win the next two matches and see what happens.   I got part one done.   I played great today, three birdies, no bogies.   Another round like this tomorrow, I think I've got a good chance.

Q.   It's not the easiest course for sure. 
KEVIN NA:   No.   The roughs are getting longer and longer.   They are not mowing them.   Like that rough like there, it was brutal.   I couldn't even see my ball.   The key was to pop it on the green and I was going to win the match.   I hit a really good shot out of there.
