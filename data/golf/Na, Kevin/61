 Q.  Talk through your round a little bit.  Obviously a tough finish there.  But talk about your position heading into tomorrow.  KEVIN NA: Yeah, I got to think of the positive.  I played well today.  I hung in there.  The good news is I'm only two back, so a low round tomorrow, post it early and sit in the clubhouse and watch.   Q.  You've shot some really good round around this golf course, you contended here a couple of times.  What is it about the golf course that fits your eye so well?  KEVIN NA: I don't know.  I think it favors the right-to-left player and that's what I am.  I draw the ball.  Seems like I make a lot of putts out here, so that's two good things.   Q.  What's your mindset heading into tomorrow?  KEVIN NA: Well, if I was going to give myself a number, I think 67 will seal the deal and I think 68's got a pretty darn good chance for a playoff.
