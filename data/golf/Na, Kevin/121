  Q. Just your overall thoughts about having such a big-time performance here at a big time event.   
 KEVIN NA: Well, I always felt that this golf course suited my game. You don't have to overpower this golf course. I mean, you've got to chip and putt well out here, and that's just my game.   
 I felt like I played great the whole week. One bad hole, I had a triple bogey that I think really cost me a chance to win this golf tournament, but I was still right there until the end. Stenson is playing incredible golf. You've got to tip your hat to him. He's just played unbelievably well.  
  
  Q. Talk about 16 and what it felt like.   
 KEVIN NA: 16, I eagled it yesterday, too. A downhill putt, I can just see the line, and I said, you know what, I think I can make this and get myself in the tournament, and I hit it and it was right on line. If anything it was a little firm. It hit the back of the cup and just jumped in.   
  
  Q. Obviously you were playing with John, and you guys are two young American players. He never really had a big time performance, either, in an event like this. Do you think you guys made a little bit of a statement that you guys are two young American players to watch?  
 KEVIN NA: Definitely. I think John and I, I think we're both -- I think after this week guys are going to keep more eyes on us. We both grew up in southern California. John is a hell of a player. He played awesome right until the end. There's more of us out there kind of in the shadow of some other young hot players. Hopefully I'll break through soon.
