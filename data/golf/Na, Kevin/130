  Q.  4-under, nice going, just a couple comments on the round.   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, played real solid today.  Had a nice group with K.J. and Jason.  I kind of got a slow start, but I holed it on 8 for a 2, so happy birthday for Papa NA.  He was liking that.   
 It kind of went from there and I started playing very well.   
  
  Q.  Today is your dad's birthday?   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, he's like 35 for the 20th time.   
  
  Q.  How about the galleries?  How impressive is it out there?   
 KEVIN NA:  It is crazy here.  You know what, I like this.  I think we should have a couple more tournaments like this, but just because there isn't too many like this, it makes it more special.  Honestly, even though they're talking and going crazy over the ball, I don't really mind because actually when it's dead silent and you hear one thing, that's what kind of makes you flinch more than anything.  I like it.   
  
  Q.  You put yourself in position a lot of times going into Sunday, and here you are in position again.  Just talk a little bit about the thought process you have going into tomorrow.   
 KEVIN NA:  Just like every day, one shot at a time, play aggressive, but conservative aggressive.  You know, sometimes things have got to go your way, and hopefully -- I come to a tournament every week and hope that it's my week.   
  
  Q.  Going to the Super Bowl?   
 KEVIN NA:  No, I've got to fly back home real quick.  I wish.
