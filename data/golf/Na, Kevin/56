  KEVIN NA:   You know, I got off to a really good start and I did everything right until 9.   You know, I think if that ball goes another yard, it's fine.   A little unlucky.   I went back and hit one more club and it was perfect.   The first club was a 9-iron and there was a lot more wind than I thought definitely up there.   And I hit it solid, it was just a little right. 
    The thing is, if it was even at the pin I think -- I mean, you're supposed to hit it, you know, 10 feet past the hole, and where my ball flew was pin high, which is not the right play.   You know, I went back and, like I said, I hit one more club, a little soft one more club and it was 10 feet past the hole, perfect where I needed to be.   So I got a little unlucky and a little miscue there with the club. 
    And then the back nine, I gave myself some chances to make birdie and I just made nothing, absolutely made nothing.   I mean, it just -- it was disgusting, how to misread it.   I actually hit a couple good putts that bumped offline and it just wasn't meant to be.
