Q.   A comment about today.   How were the conditions?
KEVIN NA:   It was wet, but the pins were really tucked.   It was hard to get to, a lot of‑‑ you had to take advantage of par‑5s, and besides that, there weren't really too many birdie opportunities out there.   The score shows; 4‑under is leading.   That shows you how tough the course is playing.

Q.   So your position going into tomorrow, are you happy with it?
KEVIN NA:   Yeah, I played very well.   Anything under par is a good score today.   Anything under par every day, after four rounds, is a good score.
