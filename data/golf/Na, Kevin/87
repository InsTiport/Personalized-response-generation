 Q.   Bogey‑free round for Kevin Na on this day.   Tell me about the feeling that you've had to defend the title for the first time on the PGA TOUR?  
KEVIN NA:   I felt great.   I was pretty pumped up until I was 2‑over through 8.   Got behind the eight ball.   Finished nicely yesterday with three birdies on the last three holes.   Kind of got myself back in it.  
Tough challenge today, five birdies, no bogeys.   I feel like I left a few out there, but on this course it's easy to do.  
Overall, 8‑under par is not too bad.  
   
 Q.   We saw Ryan Moore, a local player, tie the course record here on day one.   How much does local knowledge actually help?  
KEVIN NA:   It's all about the comfort zone.   On these greens, there are a couple spots where you can't see it, but the ball will go towards one direction and you have to be able to trust it.   
I know everyone tells you that the ball goes towards the Statosphere, but it's harder to trust it than when you already hit a (indiscernible.)   
   
 Q.   In the year that you've had since defending and now that you're back here, how are you a better player than when you won here last year?   
KEVIN NA:   I got a win.   I got a trophy at home.   That's nice.  
I've had a good year so far.   I've had six Top 10s, just shy of two million.   I'll have past two million this week.   Four years in a row past two million, I feel pretty good.
