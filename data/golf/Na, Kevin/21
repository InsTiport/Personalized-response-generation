Q. Fighting the winds and some of the rain.  2-down going to 12 and you win four holes in a row and you beat Justin Rose.  Your thoughts on how this match played out?
KEVIN NA: I played awesome today.  The back nine I was clutch.  I hit some great shots in difficult conditions, just like that last hole right there.  Who would have thought I'd be hitting 6-iron in this hole?  And what a shot I hit there.
Q. You've got Molinari coming up next.  So let me ask you about the match and how you're feeling.  I know the neck has been a problem this week.  How are you doing?  Talk about Francesco.
KEVIN NA: The neck is a struggle right now.  I hit a shot out there on 8 and it was painful.  So there's still a little bit of pain.  Keep forcing some Advil down my throat and that will help.
Francesco is obviously a great player.  Looking forward to the match.  It's going to be fun.
Q. You took out one Ryder Cup veteran, let's see if you can do it again this afternoon.
KEVIN NA: Yeah, that would be good.
