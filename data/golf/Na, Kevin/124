 Q. Sometimes all you can do is give yourself a chance, and you did that, so you've got to at least be pleased with that. 
 KEVIN NA: Yes, I am, but I'm kind of upset. I gave it my best. I got off to a terrible start. I couldn't have gotten off to any worse start. The way I hung in there, I was pretty proud of myself. I played solid -- I couldn't have hit it any worse. I was all over the lot. I mean, I've got a great short game, and I just made every putt I could except the last one.

 Q. But you way you said it, the start you got off to, 2-over par after three holes, what kind of grit does that take to be able to just go, okay, enough of this, I'm straightening it out, and you did. How did you do it?
 KEVIN NA: I was about pack it up and go home. I was so upset, but I hung in there. I kept my head in it, and I've done a very good job with that lately, the past couple years, and I've gotten better. 
 You grow as a player doing that, and I've done it before and I kept thinking positive, and I just hit a shot at a time. I mean, I was pulling draws today so I kept aiming right and hitting Kenny Perry draws out there. I've just got to take the positive. I know I'm disappointed. 
 I played that last putt right center. Kenny, my caddie, was saying inside right and I said right center. I hit a good putt, just too soft, and it broke off. The line I chose I needed to hit it firmer and it would have been in. But what can you do? 

 Q. This early in the year, though, you've got to be really happy knowing you're hitting the ball this well, and if you do make mistakes you're able to come back from those. 
 KEVIN NA: Yeah, actually I'm hitting it all over the lot. I'm making the putts, though. Sometimes it's not how good you hit it out here, it's how much you want it. I really wanted it. I mean, I fought harder than anybody out there. I'm sure you saw it out there. But just a little bit short. 
 When I made that bomb on 8 to go under par for the day -- I mean, I was six back at one point from Kenny Perry, and I said, you know what, there's a lot of golf to be played, and I just kept thinking positive and kept making putts, making them for par and for birdie, making them from everywhere. That bomb on 8, I said, I've got a chance to win this golf tournament.

 Q. Another close call at the FBR. What are you feeling now? 
 KEVIN NA: I'm going to win here someday. Next year. I'm going to win here multiple times when my career is over, that's for sure. You know, I'm just falling a little short every time. One of these days I'll pull through, and when I do, I'll have a multiple winning season. 

 Q. (Question regarding the last putt on 18.)
 KEVIN NA: You know, I looked at that last putt. I was reading the putt, and I couldn't see it going left that much. I mean, I had it going right center at the most, almost straight in, and my caddie reads the greens like no one else, and he said inside right. I said, "Okay, I'll play right center." He said, "If you're going to go right center you've got to be firm," and I just didn't hit it firm enough, and it broke more than I thought, too. I hit a good putt, just misread the green a little bit. 
 I putted awesome today. I made all the clutch putts I needed to. I'm disappointed, but I'm proud of myself. 

 Q. You always play well in the desert it seems. You had a chance in Tucson, too. 
 KEVIN NA: I lost in a playoff.

 Q. Did you play well at the Hope, too?
 KEVIN NA: At the Hope, never, just Arizona.

 Q. What is it about here?
 KEVIN NA: They call me Kevin "Arizo-Na." Mark Wilson calls me Kevin "Arizo-Na."
