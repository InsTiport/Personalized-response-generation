  Q.  Kevin, a 5 under par 68 in the first round.  Good position.  You're 116th coming into this week.  This is a good chance to pass some people.   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I'm locked for 125 Money List, so that's not a problem.  But it's always nice to move up the Money List and have some extra Christmas money.   
 I definitely played solid today.  I think I had six birdies and an eagle.  I started off with an eagle on the first and holed out from a hundred yards, so that was a nice start.   
 Unfortunately I did have a triple bogey on a Par 3, and we were on the at clock and I rushed it a little bit off the tee and pulled it into the palm trees.  I should have called unplayable, but I tried to hit it out.   
 It took another two shots for me to get it out of there.  So it was unfortunate that I made triple, but I came back nicely.   
  
  Q.  Just a really bad lie?   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, really bad lie.  I thought I could have banked it just a little bit in the bunker and get up and down for a bogey.  If I called unplayable I would've been in the rough -- if I called unplayable I would have made bogey or at worst double.  I thought I could make an easier bogey by trying to hit it out of there, but it just wasn't the case.   
  
  Q.  Very solid first round.  Keep it up.   
 KEVIN NA:  Thank you.
