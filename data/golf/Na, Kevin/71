 Q.   4‑under 66 in the second round, including quite a fabulous finish.   Talk about that.   
KEVIN NA:   Yeah, that was a nice finish.   I've been hitting it good all day.   I hit one real close on 17, had about a six‑, seven‑footer up the hill, made it.   And 18, I didn't hit that bad of a shot, just a little long left, and got the drop off the grandstand.   That pin is so close to the grandstand, and that was a tough chip.   The only way for me to stop it was the pin.   I hit the pin and luckily it fell in.   
   
 Q.   Were scoring conditions much easier today?  
KEVIN NA:   I'd say it's a little easier because we're playing early, they had a little bit of rain.   The greens are receptive, and I think that's why you're seeing a few more under pars.   
   
 Q.   Bogey‑free around here is pretty good.   How did you manage that?  
KEVIN NA:   Oh, definitely.   You know, I kept it in the fairway, hit a lot of greens.   I think I only missed two or three greens, so I gave myself a lot of chances for birdie.   You know, sometimes these putts downhill, you can't get aggressive, you've just got to lag it.   
   
 Q.   You've played here before.   Do you like this course?  
KEVIN NA:   Yes, it's a great golf course.   You know, I love‑‑ I'm very pleased to be back this year, and hopefully I can keep coming back.
