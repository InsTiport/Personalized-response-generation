Q.     69.   7-under par, 5th position?
KEVIN NA:   I played solid today.   I hit a lot of good shots.   Good chip-in and overall a great day.

Q.   Couple of weeks ago played well at Valspar.   What's been the key to your golf game right now?
KEVIN NA:   Keep the ball in front of me and rolling some putts.   When I do make mistakes it's playable where it's right around the green and I've been able to get those up and down. 
I think the only thing tomorrow I got to do is to take better advantage of the par-5s. 

Q.   How was the course today?
KEVIN NA:   It was difficult but the officials did a great job of setting it up where it was fair.
