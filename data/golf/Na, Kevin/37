 Q.  I'm sure you were disappointed after the match this morning.  How do you reset?  
KEVIN NA: I felt like I played pretty decent in my third match.  I had it 4 up and Chris Wood just turned it on.  He made four birdies and an eagle in a nine-hole stretch and I couldn't keep up.   
On 16, I asked the walking scorer what happened to the match in front of me.  I knew if they halved, I would have still advanced with a loss today.  I found out that Fitzpatrick came back and won.  So my goal was I've got to put this behind me and go play one great hole or a couple great holes.  I just kept telling myself be aggressive, be aggressive and I hit a great aggressive shot.   
 Q.  Is it odd that you are thinking about things like that?  I'm sure in a stroke play event --  
KEVIN NA: In a stroke play event, you think about the next day.  You try to make the best day out of it possible.  In match play, you lose, it's done.  There is no coming back.  With the playoff, I mean, basically one hole decides whether you advance or not.  Not only -- if you advance, you got a chance to keep going and win.  You never know what's going to happen.  You leave the tournament with what could have happened.  I'm giving myself another chance tomorrow.
