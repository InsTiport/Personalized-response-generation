KEVIN NA: It was an awful day out there.  A good day to sit at home and watch a movie.  I hit it pretty good from tee to green.  Absolutely made nothing.  I think the longest putt I made -- I made a couple of 5-footers for par early on in the day.  And then two three-putts from 22 feet.  I don't think I made a putt outside five feet today.  It was brutal.
Q. (Inaudible.)
KEVIN NA: You know what?  The weather is supposed to be halfway decent.  A low one tomorrow and get back into it.
