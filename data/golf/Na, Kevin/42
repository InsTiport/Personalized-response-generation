 Q.  Solid round, 69.  Good opening.  Some general thoughts on the first round and how different did the course play after the delay.  
KEVIN NA: It played definitely different.  The greens were a little bit slower, the course was playing a little longer, and the rough was a lot more juicy with the wet grass.  I played pretty well overall, I played great on the front and I got it to 5-under and I let a couple slip away on the back nine, but the back nine's a tougher nine.   
 Q.  On back side, was it just a matter of maybe keeping the putter hot?  It seemed you made everything.  On the back it looked good, but just didn't find the bottom.  
KEVIN NA: I putted really well all the way up to number 14.  And then 15 I hit my first bad putt of the day and I missed it right.   
Then on 17 I actually hit a good putt, so that one I'm not too worried about.  But yeah I felt like I left one out there.
