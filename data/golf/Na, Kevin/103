 Q. Kevin, 12-under par, tremendous playing through two rounds. Can we get some comments?
 KEVIN NA: Yeah. I've been hitting the ball real well. I was hitting the ball well going into the PLAYOFFS. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well there. So I obviously didn't have a good finish. 
 And I got some good rest coming into this week. I was just hoping to make some putts today because I was hitting the ball really well. Yesterday I hit it really well. I felt like I could have scored better, and today the only difference was I was making putts.

 Q. Kevin, could you tell there was a big difference playing early with these greens? Do you think part of yesterday's --
 KEVIN NA: It's not just this green. It's everywhere you go. I mean obviously the morning guys have better greens. 

 Q. So you knew you had to take advantage of the opportunity; right?
 KEVIN NA: Definitely.

 Q. The fresh -- everything being fresh and stops the ball. What's been working well for you? You said you've been hitting it well lately?
 KEVIN NA: Yes. I've been hitting the ball well. Just straighter and longer. It's always good, isn't it? It's as simple as that. 

 Q. Now, clear up something for us. You're listed as living in Vegas. You're listed as living in LA. You live here; right?
 KEVIN NA: Yeah. I live in the Red Rock. I just moved here. I used to live out in Summerlin, but I just moved out to Red Rock last week. On the golf course. 

 Q. Very nice. Oh, on the golf course there? At Red Rock Country Club?
 KEVIN NA: No. The public course.

 Q. The public. How's that for you?
 KEVIN NA: It's good. I like it.

 Q. What is it about living here?
 KEVIN NA: I love these two golf courses. Red Rock Canyon, TPC Las Vegas, I guess is what it's called now. It's got a great driving range. This is a great golf course to practice on. Whatever we want to do, they make it happen for us. So you know, whether it's practice, playing, food, everything. They take good care of us.

 Q. Do you feel like you do have an edge, then, when you play here?
 KEVIN NA: Yeah. I do. Of course. I've been here, you know, the last couple weeks while I was off and playing and practicing. But I still don't read the greens perfect. 

 Q. Yeah. I mean the other guys shoot 10-under today, Tommy Haas. 
 KEVIN NA: Uh-huh. It's out there. 

 Q. There's a lot of low numbers. 
 KEVIN NA: It's out there.

 Q. It just seems like the course is --
 KEVIN NA: 10 was actually tougher than yesterday. Yesterday I felt like it was about half a shot to a shot easier. But when you're hitting it well, getting it in there, it doesn't really matter, I guess.

 Q. From a confidence standpoint, where would you assess you're at right now? Just overall just how are you feeling with your game and yourself?
 KEVIN NA: You know, this game you go day by day. You don't want to be too -- I mean you want to be confident, but then once you start thinking then you have it, the game fires back right at you.

 Q. That's why I'm asking, because right now you're feeling good about things. 
 KEVIN NA: Let's keep it on the DL. (Laughs).

 Q. Kevin, great job today. Again, bogey-free. You were just hitting fairways and greens and giving yourself tons of chances. 
 KEVIN NA: Yes, I was. I got off to kind of a slow start, made a bunch of pars, and then made a great birdie on the par-3, 5. And then on 9 I was just thinking hit the fairway and I get a chance at eagle and I hit it in the rough. Same spot I did yesterday. It's the thickest part -- thickest rough on the golf course. I had no shot, laid up. And I hit the 8-iron to about a foot and that's where I think I got my round going. 
 Then I turned around and hit -- I actually hit it three feet on 9. I turned around and hit it a foot on 10, and 12 I hit it like six feet and made it. Three and a half feet, chipped from three and a half feet, made it; 10 feet, made it. Actually drivable par-4 is one I felt like I left one out there, and then obviously again on the par-5, chipped it to about four or five feet and made it.

 Q. Looked like yesterday guys were tiptoeing a little bit because the ball wasn't spinning quite right and you guys were kind of trying to find it, and then today everybody was attacking. 
 KEVIN NA: The course kind of changed from the practice round. The greens firmed up quite a bit, and it's all right. Really good right now.

 Q. You've sure got it today. This is a home game. You get to sleep in your own bed. 
 KEVIN NA: Uh-huh.

 Q. To some guys that's not a good thing because it's out of your routine of being out on the road. You must like it. 
 KEVIN NA: Yeah. You know, actually got on the first hole yesterday I was pretty confident. A little jitters going. I actually like that because a lot of times I'll come out here and I'll tee it up and I don't feel anything because, you know, we do this every day, and actually a little bit of jitters makes you focus -- to me it helps you focus better. 

 Q. Good week for you then. 
 KEVIN NA: Thanks.
