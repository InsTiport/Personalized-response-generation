  Q.  Kevin, a couple hiccups at the start and yet you have the composure to bring it back.   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, I got off to kind of -- actually I was hitting it very well, hitting a lot of greens, wasn't making the putts, and I had a few bad breaks with a flier and it cost me a couple bogeys.  But I came back nicely.   
 I think the only thing I kind of regret is at the par-3, 11th, my first putt.  But besides that I feel like I played pretty well.   
  
  Q.  A classy up-and-down on 18 for birdie gets you into double digits?   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, I almost blinded myself with the sun in my eye.  It was a tough shot.  Almost holed it.  But it was nice to finish with a birdie.   
  
  Q.  A double experience for you today, playing in the last group and also playing with K.J.   
 KEVIN NA:  Yeah, I played with K.J. a few years ago in the final group with Phil in Phoenix, and that was a lot of fun, and it was a lot of fun today, and maybe I'll see him in a playoff tomorrow.
