 Q. A little layoff now until tomorrow, you're still right in the middle of this, kind of give your thoughts. 
 KEVIN NA: It's unfortunate that we didn't finish today. I was playing well and Ernie was, but tomorrow is another day. We'll come out and I'll give it my best, and I think I still need to make a few birdies coming in to get a chance maybe in a playoff. 
 I'll just go out, have dinner, just relax. It's nice we are not starting too early. I'm already going to miss two flights already. I already had one at nine tomorrow morning, so go find another flight and come out tomorrow and fire. 
 It was difficult. I thought yesterday was playing toughest but today because we teed off earlier, the greens were a little more softer and because of the overcast, the moisture was holding more on the greens. So still very windy and the greens are really firm, so it's hard to hold shots. 

 Q. You're a couple of strokes back going into tomorrow. You've been in this position before, just talk a little about what you've learned in the past. 
 KEVIN NA: You know, I just have to do what I've got to do. Can't worry about where I'm at or what I need to do or what the score is. I just have to go out and play one good shot at a time and see what happens at the end. 
 I was playing well and Ernie looked like he was struggling, probably good for Ernie that they called it, so he can clear his head a little bit.
 16, 17, 18 is definitely going to play easier because the greens are going to be softer now and you are going be to be able to go to the pin and hold it. For me, I need to make birdies to catch Ernie. This that sense, it's a good thing.

 Q. How much are you looking forward to it?
 KEVIN NA: I'm looking forward to it a lot. I've been in this position a lot. It's always nice to be in this position, and you know, tomorrow, I have nothing to lose, two back, and I'll go out and start firing at pins and see what happens.

 Q. Is there a strategy you put in place overnight and have to execute in the morning?
 KEVIN NA: Yes, obviously I'm on the green on 15. I've got a long putt. My first step is to 2-putt. 
 16, you can make three on that hole. Obviously four is good, and three would be a bonus, and 17 -- you have to make a birdie on 16. And 17, 18, you get lucky and catch one birdie, then sit in the clubhouse and wait and see what happens.
