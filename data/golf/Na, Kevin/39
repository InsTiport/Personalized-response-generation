Q. Kevin, your group, some prodigious young players with Justin Thomas and Matthew Fitzpatrick, but you handled that match against Fitzpatrick very nice.  5 & 4 victory.  How did you set it up?
KEVIN NA: I played really solid today.  Front nine I made probably three birdies and an 8-footer for eagle that was given to me.  I made no bogeys.  And even all the way to the end, I made one bogey.  But all I needed to do was make a bogey to win the match.
So overall I played really solid.  I didn't make a lot of mistakes.  Quite a lot of pressure.
Q. You must feel great going into your big match against Justin Thomas tomorrow, which ultimately could decide this group?
KEVIN NA: It's not over until it's over.  Last year I won the first two matches, halved the third, and I was the only guy not to advance with two and a half points.
So, yes, obviously Justin Thomas is a strong seed in our bracket, in our pod, so tomorrow is going to be a big day.
