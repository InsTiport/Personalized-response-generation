 Q. How would you describe the setup today?KEVIN NA: Oh, it was a lot more difficult than the first two days.  It was playing faster and the pins were tucked a lot more where if you get a little careless, it could easily roll off the greens.  And a lot of spots where when you are off the green, you hit it short or it will come back right back towards your foot. Obviously I got in a little trouble on that hole where -- the alternative of that was shot, the line I hit was right back where my feet was.  It was easy to do.
Q. Have you had a 15-foot birdie putt in any other tournament?  Your second shot.KEVIN NA: Oh, yeah, I had a great shot.  My reaction was I hit it and twirled the club, and this is good.  It got a bad bounce.  It went forward quite a bit and to the right.  And I thought it was going to stay up, but it just trickled off the green.  And I went from, like you said, having a 15-foot birdie putt to making double bogey.
Q. The location today was the main difference between the first --KEVIN NA: I think so.  And there was definitely more breeze out there.  And the wind switched to a different direction, which we weren't used to. The first two days' wind was what we had in the practice round and today was a completely different one.
Q. How tough is it when you hit a good shot like that and then you end up getting a double?  What does that do for your momentum?KEVIN NA: Well, I look at it as I was ten feet from the flag.  If I hit it right at the flag, it wouldn't be a problem.
Q. Did you pay attention to what Martin was doing?  You got within four shots, did you know that?KEVIN NA: I knew that.  I was hoping if I could somehow finish at 4 or maybe even get to 5, that I might be within a couple of him.  And unfortunately it went the other way.
Q. Was it too hard on a day like this to expect -- you were playing a great round, to expect that continue forever, that eventually the course is not going to kind of --KEVIN NA: Well, you take one shot at a time.  You don't think too much ahead.  I did by saying that I want to finish four or five, but I was staying one shot at a time. I got a little unlucky there on 14, which led to a double bogey.  And the rest of the holes I played pretty good except 16.  I was in the bunker.  I got a little aggressive with that par-putt. With the sun going down and it was hard to see my first putt, just hit a little too hard and I hit a bad putt on the second putt.  So another double bogey.  Easy to do out here.
Q. In Martin was not in it and 3 was the best score, and there was no rain tonight and the conditions were the same -- in other words, what do you think the best score is going to be other than Martin?KEVIN NA: 2-under par.
Q. You don't think it's even like a 71?KEVIN NA: What do you mean?
Q. For people that are minus 3, you don't --KEVIN NA: Well, that's what I think.  I think that tomorrow there's a couple of guys at 3-under.  I think 2-under par is looking good for -- without Martin looking good.  But with Martin, I don't know.  Is he at 7-under or 6-under?
Q. He went to 8.KEVIN NA: Oh, that's a big birdie.  Then I guess if somebody is going to catch him, somebody has got to get to 4- or 5-under, I would say.
