Q. Just a couple quick questions about -- I know you didn't get much time out there on the course today.
KEVIN NA: I had four holes to go.
Q. How did it feel for you?
KEVIN NA: Of course, it's tough obviously.  I have nothing to say, to be honest.  I played all right.
Q. How much of a distraction was the weather for you?
KEVIN NA: Well, I'm used to it.  There's a delay every event, I think.  It's not much of a distraction.  Just a pain in the ass to wake up early the next day.  That's the only thing.
Q. Feel like you'll be ready to go in the morning?
KEVIN NA: I think so.  Just wake up a little early, earlier than today.  Hopefully, the weather is better.
Q. Any particular holes that gave you more of a challenge than others?
KEVIN NA: Not really.  I just didn't play well a couple of holes.  Overall, I think it was playing pretty fair, just soft greens.
