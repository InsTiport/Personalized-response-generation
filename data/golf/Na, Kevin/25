 Q.  Early wake-up, no problem.  
KEVIN NA: Quick turn around.  I didn't feel I played that bad yesterday, shot even par and today, you know, I lite it up with the putter, making a lot of putts, hit a lot of good shots in there, put myself in good position.   
 Q.  We've been opining, the heat, the golf course here, the iron play?  What's your take on the golf course?  
KEVIN NA: You've got to bomb it over the bunkers.  I'm not going to do that.  There's some bunkers I actually can crush it and I've been getting over it for me.  But the keys to put it in play.  The roughs are deep out here.  So I've been playing my game, which is put it in play, hitting the irons well and then make a lot of putts.   
 Q.  That's a super start.  Good luck on the weekend.  
KEVIN NA: Thank you.
