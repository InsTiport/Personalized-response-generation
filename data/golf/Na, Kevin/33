Q. Was a great day.  Kevin, when I think of the Sedgefield Country Club, the name pops to mind is Kevin Na.  You got the game that suits this place.
KEVIN NA: I like this golf course.  It suits my game.  I don't have to feel like some of these Majors I play.  But, yeah, suits my game very well and I'm putting the ball well right now.  I like my chances.
Q. Putting the ball well.  A key coming into the week?
KEVIN NA: I've been putting really poorly this year.  I've been hitting it okay.  I was a little sick in the middle of the year but besides that I hit it pretty good all year and I looked at my putting stat last week and I was shocked, absolutely shocked.  I can't tell you what the numbers were, but I was shocked.
I worked on it and something clicked last week and Friday and it's been good since.  Keeping my fingers crossed that this keeps going and maybe finish strong this year.
Q. You mentioned keep going.  You got after it today, guys having their way with the golf course, conditions ripe for scoring.  Are you thinking numbers wise or just go about the business?
KEVIN NA: You know, just go about the business but, at the same time, you know, the guys are going to go low.  I think the winning score is going to be very close to around 20.  So I got to keep the foot on the pedal and make a lot of birdies.
Q. Keep hydrated, too.
KEVIN NA: That, too.  It's tough out there.
