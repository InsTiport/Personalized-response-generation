Q. 5 and 4.  Way to start out the week.
KEVIN NA: Yeah, I played real solid today.  Didn't make any mistakes.  Applied a lot of pressure.  It was one of those days that I could have played against anybody I played so well.  But it was nice to get off with a win the first day.
Q. It's obviously a long week, is there any advantage to obviously finishing your matches a little early and keeping the wear and tear on your legs and body, does that help?
KEVIN NA: Definitely.  It does take some energy.  Not only that just mental fatigue, winning your match is a little easier, less wear on your mind.  And also means you're playing that much better, too.
Q. Matthew Fitzpatrick, how did he play today?
KEVIN NA: He's a great player.  He probably didn't have his "A" game.  He made a couple of birdies that actually we halved two holes with a birdie.  He didn't have his "A" game and I played real solid.  So he just kind of got down a little bit and he started trying to press the issue a little bit.  Made more mistakes.
Q. How do you like this course?
KEVIN NA: I do, I like it a lot.  I did well last year, too, I won two matches and halved one.  So I like it a lot.
Q. What makes a good match play course?
KEVIN NA: A lot of risk and reward.  Some tight, short par-3s, where you're about going to see a lot of birdies.  You don't want a boring golf course that's wide open, just hitting and killing it.  There's a lot of character to the greens and the golf course.
Q. In terms of the winds and whatnot, it's kind of windy out there?
KEVIN NA: Yeah, it was windy out there.  It's always windy out here.  It's going to be even windier tomorrow.  Wind is going to be a big factor this week.
