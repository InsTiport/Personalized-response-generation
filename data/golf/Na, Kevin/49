 Q.  Talk about the first few holes.  You couldn't do anything wrong.  
KEVIN NA: I did nothing wrong.  I played great all day.  I hit a good putt on 16, obviously, that you saw that lip out.   
17, I had the putt going right.  I had it left center, inside left, and my caddie agreed with me.  And I hit my spot, and it actually wiggled a little left and caught the hole and lipped out.   
Justin played great.  After that double bogey, he bounced back with three birdies in a row.  And he probably could have birdied 18 if he didn't have a shot lead.   
So, I gave it my best shot.  It just keeps getting more and more disappointing, because three weeks in a row I'm right there.   
But you got to take the positive.  I'm playing the best golf of my life.  I got another shot at the world championship next week.   
 Q.  Talk about next week in China.  Obviously, a place that you've done fairly decent, as well.  With the form that you're in, you must be looking forward to going there.  
KEVIN NA: Yeah, that's it.  I've got a good shot again, if I keep playing the way I've been playing.  One of these weeks I'll win.   
 Q.  Good.  Come back here next year to the CIMB?  
KEVIN NA: For sure.  I got a 2 and a 3, so 1 is next.
