 Q.   Great week.   35 points.   Just solid all the way through.   You have a big smile on your face.   
JASON ALLRED:   I do.   It's a bit fresh.   Naturally the competitor in me is a bit disappointed.   I didn't have my best stuff today.   
But that said, I really hung in there.   I played my heart out.   I can honestly look back and say that I had a great time.   Certainly gave it my best.  
Hopefully next time I'll do a little better.  
   
 Q.   Anything stand out in your mind, a particular part of your game you're pleased with this week?  
JASON ALLRED:   You know, probably that intangible of just giving each shot my best whether it was for bogey or birdie.   Just hanging in there.  
The first three rounds I drove the ball great so I had a lot of good chances.   Today it was my first time in the final group on Sunday, so a good learning experience.   I really hope I have more chances, and I feel like I'll be better next time.  
   
 Q.   Final question is:   Is it the format?   Is it the golf course?   Combination of both that you can attribute to the top 10 finish this week?  
JASON ALLRED:   Good question.   A lot of it being I'm here on a sponsor exemption thanks to the folks at the Barracuda, I just tried to remember what a gift it was be here in the first place.  
That's easier said than done for me.   I love the game and I want to do well so bad.   Just to remember I have nothing to lose.   Just to play a little more free.   
I think it's set up well for this format, too, more free and the let‑it‑rip attitude you can have, it goes a long way.   
So thankfully, yeah, I did all right.
