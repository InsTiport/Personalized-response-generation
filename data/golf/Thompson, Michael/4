 Q.  Michael, what a day on the greens for you.  You managed nine birdies on what I think is a very difficult golf course.  Tell me about the round.  Was that ball striking or putting?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: A little bit of both.  I actually hit my wedges really well today but I rolled my rock.  I made a lot of good putts and rolled in a few 20 plus footers.  So that is kind of what makes a good round a great round.  Just really pleased with how I played.   
 Q.  I know you stubbed your toe at 15, double bogey.  It's golf, it's a hard game, it happens.  But just as important is the way you responded to that double bogey, four straight birdies.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Yeah, that was pretty special.  I don't know if I've ever done that before after a double.  So that was pretty cool.  I just told myself I'm playing well, I'm hitting a lot of good golf shots and just stick with the plan, stick with my game plan and my routine and just believe in myself and it paid off.   
 Q.  You get to come back to the Stadium Course for the final round.  Is it a bonus to play this back-to-back days?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I think so.  It's fresh in my mind, especially after a good round.  I know what I need to do and I know I can go out there and do it, I can put a good round together out there and I think that's a little bit of an advantage.
