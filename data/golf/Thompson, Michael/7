 Q.  What was it like out there today after a little break for yourself?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Yeah, it was actually kind of nice.  I came out here early and practiced a little bit before for a couple hours, so trying to get my rhythm back after going to the football game last night.  It actually warmed up a little bit when we were out there playing, which is kind of nice.  I know it's going to be really cold tomorrow morning, but man, I just got into a good rhythm, and just, again, like I said earlier on the driving range, just trying to hit some good putts, give myself lots of chances with wedges, and I've done that so far.   
 Q.  Is it hard in these conditions?  You've played in almost every condition imaginable this week.  Is it hard for anybody to know where they are right now?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think we're all getting the days mixed up now.  We've been here for so long, and just with all the delays.  But you know, I'm just trying to stay focused on my next shot and the next hole, and I'm in a good rhythm.  I'm in a good place mentally.  I'm looking forward to taking advantage of it tomorrow.
