Q.   A fabulous win, what does this mean to you?
MICHAEL THOMPSON:   This is everything, this is a childhood dream come true.   I dream of playing out here since I was seven years old and to win, it's just unbelievable.   I just can't put it into words.   The whole day was awesome.   My ball‑striking was way better today than it was yesterday.   I just enjoyed the ride, and you know, glory to God for the time He's given to me and all of us out here, it's just awesome. 

Q.   Not only did you win, you won The Honda Classic, one of the best fields of the year, that has to mean a great deal. 
MICHAEL THOMPSON:   Absolutely, guys like Tiger, Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy, Geoff Ogilvy coming down the stretch making birdie on the last to put pressure on me, it's just awesome.   It really kind of solidifies in my mind that I'm one of the guys now, and that's a special feeling. 

Q.   This is going to be a little life‑changing now, you'll be in a lot of majors and a lot of big events coming up, are you looking forward to that?
MICHAEL THOMPSON:   Absolutely.   I love the big events.   I'm already in the Masters and U.S. Open, but British Open hopefully, and you know, it's just another step in my career.   I'm on a long journey, and I don't know where it's going to take me, but I'm here for the ride.
