 Q.  6-under yesterday at La Quinta, eight birdies around the Nicklaus Course this morning.  Tell us about it.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: My putter was working today.  I gave myself some good chances.  I hit the ball better today than I did yesterday, which was nice.  Found the center of the club face, which is always good.  But, yeah, it was a solid day.  I missed the four short putts today, even though I putted great.  So still room for improvement.  But can't beat this weather, can't beat these golf courses, so I'm excited.   
 Q.  Referencing yesterday, I watched you on the range working hard with Todd.  Did he share a tip or two there?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Yeah, he just had me get back on my heels a little bit.  I have a tendency to get on my toes.  And when I do that, I, when I make the swing, I actually go backwards as I'm hitting the ball.  So he wants me moving my weight through the ball forward.  So, all it was was just getting my weight a little bit more on my heels and allowing me to fire through the ball a little bit better and it seemed to work.   
 Q.  Paid some dividends today.  Stadium Course tomorrow, your thoughts?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It's going to be a little bit tougher of a test.  A little bit more trouble.  But I'm hitting it good, I'm going to go put on a good range session again this afternoon and get some rest and just go after it tomorrow.
