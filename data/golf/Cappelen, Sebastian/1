 Q.   First round of 65.   Bogeyed the opening hole and 8 birdies after that.   You've got to feel pretty special about that, don't you?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, for me, sometimes all it takes is you've got to get off to a start and kind of wake up.   That bogey did it for me.   I didn't really hit any bad shots on the first hole.   I just couldn't judge the speed right on the green, and I three‑putted.   That kind of woke me up and from there it felt easy today.  
   
 Q.   The finish last couple holes was a little bit scrappy, but two wonderful up‑and‑downs.   That's going to really give you some confidence that you can keep the momentum going?  
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, absolutely.   I knew the two last holes weren't going to be easy because the wind was kind of straight into the face.   Sometimes it would gust off one side and sometimes off the other side.   Just kind of keep it in play and giving myself a chance to at least make par on every hole is all I really wanted, and I accomplished that pretty well.  
   
 Q.   Playing in the SEC at Arkansas, winner in the Web.com Tour, also a good pedigree at a young age.   Got to use that and draw on that experience to get you through this week?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, absolutely.   I'm just trying to put myself back in that mindset when I played on the Web this summer and back to my win in Wichita, trying to get some of that same momentum going.   It was very pleasant to walk out there today and be back in it.   I've been off for a couple of weeks, which was needed as well.   But it was very nice to be back out there, and I had a good time with my caddie.   He's my good friend, so it was a good round.  
   
 Q.   Playing on a sponsor's invite, you're making the sponsors look like geniuses, aren't you?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, that's what you've got to do, look like they're making the right decision.   So it's important for me to show that I'm not just some player that gets an exemption because someone knows someone and so forth.   But I actually can play with these guys here.   So it's good.  
   
 Q.   Playing in his first ever PGA TOUR event on a sponsor s exemption, what a start.   How thrilled are you with the way you got things going here today?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   I'm so happy.   I couldn't be happier, to be honest.   Obviously, I came here just trying to get a new experience and get a feel of how it feels like to play on the real Tour, and I had a great time out there today, hit a lot of good shots, which is kind of why I'm out here.   But, yeah, it was fun, and I'm trying to just keep that going and take it with me into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What are the expectations when you have an opportunity to get in a PGA TOUR event?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   I mean, yeah, it's a good question because obviously for me, it's like, okay, I have one start.   I better make it count.   But to be honest, I just want to have the experience with me because, I mean, it's hard to make this one start count in the right way.   So I'm going to take this as an experience hopefully for the future.   I would like to join next year.  
   
 Q.   Coming so close to getting your PGA TOUR card through the Web.com in the regular season in the finals, how much does it motivate you to really make the most of this opportunity here in Mississippi?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Oh, huge.   I mean, obviously it's a heartbreaker being so close and then not getting it.   To getting a chance here where I felt like I should have been, it's everything.   I couldn't thank the sponsors here more for what they've done.   So, yeah, just having this opportunity, showing that I can actually play here is very important to me.  
   
 Q.   Obviously there was something about the course today that you liked.   Why were you able to go so low today?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Particularly my pitching wedge was really hot today.   I left myself a lot of yardages at around 120 yards.   I just needed a little knock down pitching wedge.   I think I hit like four or five inside five feet.   So I had a couple of easy birdies out there.   Then whenever I got in a little bit of trouble, I had some really good chip shots on the greens today that left me not very long for par.   So I made it look pretty easy today and it felt pretty easy too.   
I never felt like I was in trouble or in a bind somewhere where I was kind of trying to find my swing or something like that.   So it was a nice, pleasant day, and hopefully there will come a lot more of those.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you were going to have a day like this or did it come as a surprise to you?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Looking back, I'm not surprised because I've been on a break for a couple of weeks now and tried to Monday qualify two weeks ago, and haven't really played anything.   Kind of been home and got some time to relax and be with friends and stuff like that, and that's kind of how it was too when I Monday qualified in at Wichita and won there.   I played the U.S. Open qualifier and missed that, but then I didn't have anything to play really.   I was coming right out of college and took a lot of time just getting ready and stuff.   Coming out here with not really knowing where my game is but still feeling good about my swing, I felt like I could just go out there and swing at it every time and put it pretty much where I wanted to every time.  
   
 Q.   Did you have any first time on the PGA TOUR nerves today or have you been out here ‑‑ you won, like you said on the Web.com you played with some of these guys.   Was it just like another event or was it, hey, this is a PGA TOUR event?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   I mean, obviously warming up in the morning there are some nerves because obviously it's a new first of something.   So you never know what to expect.   But getting on the tee, luckily it was in the morning, and people weren't up yet.   I mean, it seemed like a Web.com start to me, so I kind of got some familiar thoughts back and calmed me down and got through the first hole.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, it rained some last night and everything.   Did that soften up the course any?   How did it play?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, it was surprisingly for the greens on the first couple holes there, they were quite a bit slower and still really good.   But they just kind of threw a couple of us off and left some putts short and kind of the reason why I three‑putted the first hole because I thought it was going to be a lot faster.   Yeah, probably after 7, 8 holes it was gone and back to normal again.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that first hole to putt.   How far was your first putt and how short did you leave it?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   I was just off the front of the green on number 10.   It was probably about say 25, 30 feet.   It was going uphill a little bit, and I thought it was going to go downhill by the hole, so I didn't, obviously, play hard enough.   I probably left myself six feet short of the hole and played that one through the break, just made the putt for bogey.  
   
 Q.   You said earlier that was kind of a wake‑up call there?   Snapped you out of it a little bit?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   Yeah, that's usually how it is for me when I have a good round.   I usually start with a bogey on the first hole, and then just kind of like, okay, I've got to get going, and then it's there.   It's kind of a funny thing, but yeah.  
   
 Q.   Very satisfying to make that up‑and‑down there on your final hole?   Wasn't the easiest trip in the world.   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   No, it wasn't.   We were kind of laughing about it because we've been chipping and we chipped a lot yesterday practicing.   I was chipping well, and we haven't made anything around the greens, so we were just kind of joking around with it a little bit.   I hit it how I wanted to, just threw it high up there and let it release out to the hole.   Yeah, just needed a little more to be perfect.  
   
 Q.   What does it mean to have all that momentum you generate at Wichita but be able to carry it today on this stage?   
SEBASTIAN CAPPELEN:   I think it's everything.   I mean, showing that it's just one, not just one tournament, I think that's kind of what sticks to me.   I know with myself that I can keep it going and I'm not, yeah, not just lucky one week.
