Q.  Mark, you did some great things on the golf course this week, and today playing this last round under Open conditions, I thought you took what the golf course gave you and played U.S. Open golf?
 
MARK BROOKS:  Well, thank you.  I tried to.  It turns out a couple of bad shots I hit maybe early in the round probably proved to be fatal.  But you never know.  18 is tough, and I was trying to play conservative, when I should have.  I got two great breaks on the back 9 at 12 and 16, with the balls that kicked back in play. The only good thing is I still could have made bogeys where the balls ended up, and I didn't.  Unfortunate to finish with a 3-putt, but it's only my second one this week, not too bad. 
 
Q.  Take us back to that 3-putt on 18.  You had to be guessing there.
 
MARK BROOKS:  I was guessing, and my speed had been pretty good all week on the long putts, because I had to play to some areas I left myself long putts.  And 16 I kind of misread the speed on the birdie putt there.  And 18 I don't know, I think we read it right, if I had just hit it easier I think it would have been just right.  The second one I don't feel I hit a bad putt, it was a little slower and went up there and acted funny the last six inches.  I know a lot of people have missed important putts, and I'll live to breathe -- live to play another day, and we'll just keep going. 
 
Q.  Well, you may be playing tomorrow.  Those fellows have to play that tough 18th, too.  Congratulations, Mark, on a wonderful U.S. Open.
