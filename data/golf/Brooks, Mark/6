Q.   Pretty good round.   3‑under.
MARK BROOKS:   3‑under.   Good for me.

Q.   Did you do anything exciting?   Any long putts or anything, chip‑ins?
MARK BROOKS:   No, I managed my game pretty well today.   I didn't drive it that great, I didn't hit ‑‑ I hit a handful of good iron shots.   I was able to capitalize on those.   So that kind of made the difference.

Q.   So it was your irons, not scrambling or anything?
MARK BROOKS:   No, I had a couple of good up‑and‑downs, yeah.   But nothing spectacular.   Probably the best one I made was on 18.   I missed the green left and got up‑and‑down to that tight pin.
But I putted okay.   I hadn't been doing anything terrible and I haven't been putting great or doing the other.

Q.   You got to putt great out here.
MARK BROOKS:   You have to putt solid.   I would say I did that today.   I probably got about what I deserved today.

Q.   You're only two out of the lead right now, pretty good position.
MARK BROOKS:   Yeah, on this golf course, there's ‑‑ you know, obviously there's a lot of birdies, if the weather's good, you're going to have a handful of wedges in your hand.

Q.   Did the wind calm down for you the last nine?
MARK BROOKS:   We couldn't have asked for better weather, considering what potentially it could have been.   It could have been pretty darn breezy and colder.
