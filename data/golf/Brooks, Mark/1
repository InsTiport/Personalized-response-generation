Q. How did you like today, Mark?
MARK BROOKS: Great, 'til the end.
Q. Can you tell us a little about what happened there in the end for you?
MARK BROOKS: I thought I hit a good tee ball on 16, and it stayed in the rough.  I didn't make a very good play, hit a bad bunker shot.  17, I thought I hit a good shot, and ball just went way further than I thought.  I missed about a 3-1/2 footer for par, but I hit a good shot.
18, I didn't hit -- hit an okay bunker shot and hit a bad putt.  Tee balls.  I was in the rough all day today.  So kind of caught up, finally.
Q. When you compare, what was the difference that was affecting you today versus how you played yesterday?
MARK BROOKS: Well, I probably drove the ball a little better yesterday and made a lot of mistakes yesterday too.  But, yeah, we had a little bit more wind and, you know, afternoon, greens aren't quite as good.  That's just the way it goes.
But it's a tough golf course if you get out of position, which I was a lot today.
Q. How do you think the course played for you compared?  Had a lot of golfers coming in and saying 14 was tough, some of those shots on the back nine.
MARK BROOKS: I didn't think it played that much different than yesterday, besides the wind.  At our age, I'll be honest, I'm in great shape, and the heat was a factor today.
So hopefully, it will cool off a little bit.  Kind of doing a lot of standing around the back side, and it's hot.  It almost gets to you a little bit.
