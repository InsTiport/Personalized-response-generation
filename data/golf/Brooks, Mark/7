 Q.   You shot 4â€‘under.   Couldn't have been any fun playing alone though.   
MARK BROOKS:   It was a lot of fun.   Yeah, I enjoy playing by myself.   
   
 Q.   For five hours?   Five and a half hours?  
MARK BROOKS:   Five and a half hours?   Well, my caddie, we're good friends, so it's not a problem.  
   
 Q.   How do you keep your concentration on something like that?  
MARK BROOKS:   I'm a professional.   
   
 Q.   I understand that.   
MARK BROOKS:   I'm a professional.   But, whatever.   No big deal.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it's even an advantage at all to be alone or?  
MARK BROOKS:   Yeah, in some ways.   If the guy is not playing any good, playing with you, that's an advantage, for sure, not seeing any wild shots.   Well I hit some bad ones, but I saw a lot of bad ones, and no offense to those guys, but you know, when guys are playing good, you know how it is, you watch them all the time, a guy gets going good and he drags the other two guys with him.   But if you get going bad then they all play bad, so, you know, I enjoyed it.   It was very nice.
