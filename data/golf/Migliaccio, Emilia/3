Q. Playing in your first U.S. Women's Amateur, how did it feel playing out there today?
EMILIA MIGLIACCIO:   It felt great.  I mean, the USGA puts on such pristine events.  You feel so special to just be a part of the event, and the course is in just such great shape.  Yeah, it was just awesome to be out there and have those -- that adrenaline on the first tee, which it's been a while since I've felt that.  That's been really nice.  Yeah, my mom is my caddie, so just being with her, we're a really good team.  I got some putts rolling on the back, which felt good.
Q. Have you gotten to have your mom caddie for you quite a bit?
EMILIA MIGLIACCIO:   Yes, I have.  The last two summers she's been my caddie.  Now I'm mature enough -- before I think we were a little too both emotionally invested, so now I'm a little older and a little more mature that she does a great deal of help for me.  She knows me so well, obviously, and knows the game.  She played college golf, so she knows golf very well.  Yeah.
Q. What did you think of the course?  Have you played here before?
EMILIA MIGLIACCIO:   I haven't played here before, but it's awesome.  You're not getting a lot of roll-out, so you have mid-irons, and I think that's the best test of golf, when it's not super short but you have some wedge opportunities, so you need to be good on your wedges but then also good on your long irons for those long holes.  I think it's the best test of golf you can get.
