 Q.  Tell me about the golf course, because it looks like the hole locations are pretty tough.  Some are difficult, but that's why the ball wants to travel today, and if you hit some quality shots you could get some shots close to the hole couldn't you?  
SEPP STRAKA: Yeah, for sure.  A lot of holes you could feed it in there if you hit a good shot you're going to be rewarded pretty largely, and if you didn't you're going to be penalized pretty hard, too.   
 Q.  Tell us about your thoughts for the week here at Pebble Beach and just what it means and the history of golf and after a great round of golf on Sunday?  
SEPP STRAKA: It's amazing.  Pebble Beach is one of my favorite places.  To do my first U.S. Open here is pretty special.  To finish it off like that today was pretty cool.   
 Q.  Talk about first couple rounds, get in, and then come out here on Sunday, U.S. Open at Pebble Beach?  
SEPP STRAKA: Yeah, I mean the first couple of rounds I was definitely nervous.  It's my first U.S. Open, Pebble Beach, pretty sweet.  And then had a bad round Saturday and kind of fell back.  I bogeyed my first two today I was kind of in the latter half of the field.  So I wasn't really too nervous there for most of the day.  And started making some birds and got hot on the back nine and then started feeling nerves again on the back nine.   
 Q.  What kind of confidence does this give you now as you move on past The Open and now to just playing regular golf so to speak?  
SEPP STRAKA: It's huge.  Knowing that the best players in the world are playing this week and on a really tough test, it's pretty big for the confidence, especially the first and last round that I had just showing that I am able to play with the best of them.
