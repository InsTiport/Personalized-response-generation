 Q.     Eight birdies today.   Talk to me about that.   What was working for you out there?  
DARRON STILES:   Today I made some more putts.   I didn't really make a whole lot of putts yesterday over at Palmer, but today my iron play was a little bit better today.   
And I think these greens are the best that we have got all week.   They're all good, but I think these are the best of the three courses.   And that lends itself, they're at a perfect speed, it lends itself to making putts.   
   
 Q.   How encouraging is it for you to have such a low round early in the season, particularly given that this course tends to yield the highest of the scores between the three courses?  
DARRON STILES:   It feels great.   I felt like I was playing good coming into the start of the year.   Even last week in Hawaii I had one bad hole, I had some bad luck happen.   But then to bounce right back yesterday with six at Palmer and then seven today here at traditionally the harder of the three from what I remember.   That's great.
