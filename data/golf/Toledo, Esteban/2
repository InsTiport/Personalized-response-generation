 Q.  How would you describe your play out there, 3-under par round.  
ESTEBAN TOLEDO: Amazing.  I hit a few shots in the rough.  If you don't hit the rough in the British Open, you're not in the British Open I guess.   
I played well.  Hit the ball straight most of the time and I made a lot of putts.  Those par 5s I took advantage and I birdied 9, which is probably the toughest hole up there.  Played really well.  I wasn't nervous at all.  I knew to get it to 5-under.  I knew it was going to be tough, 17, 18.  But that's golf.  I played with two good guys and that makes myself and my game easier.  There's a lot of ways still to go and it's just the beginning.  I'm very excited to be here in Scotland.  This is the most important -- I've been here for a week playing all over Scotland, Dunbar and a bunch of courses around and it's just a thrill to be in my position right now.   
 Q.  How would you describe your level of confidence coming into this week and after today's round?  
ESTEBAN TOLEDO: Well, it's a lot of confidence.  I've been playing well.  Last week at Dick's Sporting Goods I played well and in New York, and I played well in Switzerland.  I went down and supported the Senior Swiss Open in Switzerland and played well there, too.   
But I love to play in Scotland.  This is probably my favourite place to play golf for the majors.   It's just fantastic this place, and it seemed like everybody is having a good time.  You know, you don't know what you're going to get in Scotland here, so it's good weather or bad weather, so you've got to deal with it.
