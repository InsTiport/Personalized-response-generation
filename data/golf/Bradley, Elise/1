Q. Take me through just the year. When you go through through the year you had and then to get to here, is there a little bit of like a wide-eyed moment?
ELISE BRADLEY: It has been quite the struggle this year. Really, I worked on my swing all year long and I got -- I became so mechanical on the golf course. I think that helped get me to here, to where now I can be a lot freer with it.
But really, yeah, I'm just not being so technical anymore, and I think working on it all year long helped that. But now, I'm able to be tree and play very freely on the golf course.
Q. It's one of those where no matter what goes on during the year, you're always working, putting in the work, so just a matter of time?
ELISE BRADLEY: Yeah, exactly. And thank God it's finally showing. It came at a good time. No, but it's been fun the last few rounds, playing the last few.
Q. Have you ever been here?
ELISE BRADLEY: Played in the North South here when I was a kid but not these two courses.
Q. When you got here, was it like Pinehurst, here we go?
ELISE BRADLEY: Honestly, not the really.
Q. That's good.
ELISE BRADLEY: Yeah, just kind of feels -- I mean, it's like I'm just trying to take it from the range to the golf course. Just another event.
Not really trying to put any pressure on it. Just taking it shot by shot.
