Q. Rough day yesterday.  You got the ship righted today.  What was the difference in your rounds?
NATE LASHLEY: Probably hitting fairways.  Hit more fairways today.  Yesterday, missed quite a few fairways and really didn't have any I don't think -- maybe one of them I was able to advance it up towards the green, everything else was just punching onto the back end of the fairway.  And made some more putts today too.  Yesterday just didn't real get much to go in.
So those are two probably the most important things out here, is hitting fairways and making putts.
Q. Weather seems a little bit improved over yesterday.  How was it for you out there, and did it play into your round?
NATE LASHLEY: I don't know, weather is pretty similar.  It's still a little chilly and a little breeze.  You know, I don't know.  Everybody's playing in it, you just got to go out there and grind and try to make pars and birdies.
Q. Gary Woodland at -11 and tough act to follow, tough act to catch.  What's your plan for doing what you can to move up the leaderboard on Sunday?
NATE LASHLEY: Yeah, you know, I'm just going to try to keep playing the way I'm playing, just hit fairways, hit greens, try to make some putts and see what happens.
