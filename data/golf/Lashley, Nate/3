 Q.  Good week for you. Now you're a resident here, it's got to feel good to play pretty well here.  
NATE LASHLEY: Yeah, it feels great. I really grinded it out the last couple rounds and didn't hit the ball real well but had a lot of up-and-downs, made some nice putts and it's a good finish and I'm really happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  The wind came up today and it looked like these greens started getting really firm out there. How much of a struggle was it?  
NATE LASHLEY: Yeah, the greens are getting firm out there, they have gradually gotten a little firmer, tough pin positions, it wasn't easy out there, especially for -- I don't hit it very far, some of those guys out there are bombing it up there, they the got wedges into the greens -- but I'm hitting 6- and 7- and 8-irons in, so it's a little tougher. But the course is playing tough, but it was really nice, you couldn't ask for better weather and it's a great tournament, great fan base, it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Super Bowl is tonight. Who do you like?  
NATE LASHLEY: Boy, I don't know. I'm looking for -- I'm hoping for a good game but right now I think I would take the 49ers.
