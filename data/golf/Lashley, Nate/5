 Q.  How did the golf course play?  
NATE LASHLEY: It played nice. It was a really nice day here, not much wind, nice weather. But the greens are getting firm, so the ball's bounding. But if you can get it on the green they're nice, you can make some putts.   
 Q.  You open with a 5-under par 66. You look back a year where you didn't have TOUR status, a lot of things have changed a lot since then, haven't they?  
NATE LASHLEY: Yeah, they have. It's been -- those few months were a whirlwind and it's been nice, it's been nice to be able to make my own schedule and get out here and play in these tournaments. And this is a hometown event for me, I've lived in Phoenix for 15 years now, so it's a lot of fun to get to play in the Phoenix Open.
