Q. How would you describe the finish to that round?
NATE LASHLEY:   Disappointing.  17, there for a second I thought I made the putt and it ran by a couple feet, then the second putt just bounced off line and ended up making bogey when there for a second I thought I was going to make birdie.  So that was really disappointing.
18, didn't hit a great drive, but there for a second I thought I was going to be okay, got down into the hazard.  And second shot I thought was going to be out in the fairway, the line we had, it just had a bad line and ended up in the bunker.  Then didn't have a great lie in the bunker, I caught it heavy, ended up making bogey.
So it was definitely a disappointing finish but I take this into mind, I hit it great today, I hit a lot of putts that had a chance, so just go out tomorrow, try to play well and see what happens.
Q. Do you kind of take more of a, forget about it and try to take more positives for the rest of the round?
NATE LASHLEY:   Yeah, definitely.  I drove the ball great today, pretty much every drive I hit was where I was aiming and what I was trying to do with it.  Except for 18 and really I didn't hit that bad a drive on 18, just got a touch left.  If it's another yard to the right it's probably fine.
But, yeah, take it into tomorrow, continue just try to go out and play good and relaxed golf, have some fun and make some putts.
Q. Did you ever consider taking the drop or was the lie good?
NATE LASHLEY:   No, the lie was fine down there.  It wasn't that hard of a shot, to be honest with you, we just had a bad line, we should have been aiming about 15 more yards to the right.
Q. Making putts on poa in the afternoon, talk about that?
NATE LASHLEY:   Yeah, when it's windy like this, and on the poa, the ball can do a lot of things.  It can bounce off line pretty fast, especially with the wind and it's not easy.
