  Q. So, Tania, tell me about your hole-in-one and how did it happen?  
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, I just hit it. It was 135 metres to the pin and it was a little bit downwind from the left. I hit it -- it was not a good impact and it went straight to the pin and it pitched a metre and a half short of the hole and it went in. It was brilliant.   
  
  Q. And you saw that happen; right?   
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yes, because I didn't see the first one in Ireland. So this one, I've seen it.  
  
  Q. So this is your second hole in one?  
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yes.  
  
  Q. And what does it mean for you through the tournament, because now you're 6-under par and in contention, or quite near the top of the leaderboard. How do you assess the day today?  
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, it was a great round today, and I am still feeling very, very tired because I am coming from the States.   
 So let's see if I can rest this afternoon and sleep well tonight and just rest for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Would you like to finish well here to finish the season?  
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Of course, I would like to have a good weekend and try to be at the top.   
  
  Q. Next year, will you go play in the States all year?   
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: No, I don't think so. I think I'm going to do half and half. I haven't seen the European schedule, so I'm going to check on that when I come back and try to do half and half, 50/50.   
  
  Q. Why is that?  
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, because I like Europe. I like being in Europe. I like the Tour, and I like the people. But I guess if you want to try to be in the majors, you need to play in the States, also, and that's why I went to the Q-School. But I like this tour and I would like to keep playing on this tour.
