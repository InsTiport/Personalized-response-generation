 Q. Can you talk about the course this morning and the weather? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, it was really tough. I mean, well, the golf course is very tough, and with this cold and the wind this morning, it was really, really tough. But I managed to shoot a good score, so I'm happy. 

 Q. What were the keys to your round today?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: The putting. The putting. I mean, I was very solid on the greens. I made a great up-and-down. And when I had the chance to make birdie, I made them. The putting. 

 Q. Marta Figueras-Dotti is on your bag this week; is she your coach? Was she your coach one year in the Spanish National team?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, she's my coach. It's been maybe eight, nine years that we are working together. So it's great to have her on the bag, really. 

 Q. You've only made two cuts this year. And you're obviously playing very good golf this week. What is the difference this week? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: There's not a lot of difference. I think I don't have any pressure this week. I decided not to go to Q-School next week. So I'm going to be back in Europe next year, so I think there is no pressure and just playing my golf. There's not really a big difference. 
 But just, I don't know, I had a lot of pressure this year as a rookie here, and now that I don't have any pressure, I'm just playing my golf.
