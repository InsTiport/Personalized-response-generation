   TANIA ELOSEGUI: I was going to say to my coach, it was 225 to the start of the downslope, and I thought the wind was crossing left to right. I was not hitting longer than 220 carry today, the driver. So I thought, okay, if I lay back with a 3-wood I can have a lay-up here. But it was in the rough. 

 Q. Quickly go back to that 12th hole, that long putt you made. 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, that was important.

 Q. It was a crazy hole. 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, it was a crazy hole, yeah. It's a difficult hole, really. You have to place the ball right in the middle of the trees.

 Q. You were under the tree, right? You had really no shot?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Well, I was right of the tree, so I caught the tree on the line. But I had a shot. It was just that I didn't hit it good and it went into the bunker. 

 Q. Do you feel like resting? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yes, I feel like resting, yes. 

 Q. Were you aware of the other matches out there? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, well -- yeah, I was looking at the leaderboard.

 Q. How did it make you feel to see the matches start to turn? 
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Which ones? I don't know, I mean, anything can happen.

 Q. Did you get real nervous at the first hole?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: I was nervous, yes, but I think --

 Q. You got into it?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah. I think the Europeans were feeling less nervous than the Americans because we don't have anything to lose.

 Q. Pretty loose to play with Helen?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah, it was just perfect. 

 Q. Make you laugh?
 TANIA ELOSEGUI: Yeah.
