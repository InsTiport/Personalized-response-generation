 Q.  Tremendous 7-under, 64, to share the lead.  How pleased are you with that?  
MATT WALLACE: Very happy.  Great start to the event.  Love the golf course, kind of knew that when I walked up there and played practice rounds.  Really suits my eye.  The greens are in good shape even by the end there as well.  Yeah, good start.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, I mean, I missed a couple on the front nine -- or the back nine, my front nine.  But stayed patient.  I mean, I'm still learning out here on Tour as well.  Stayed really nice and patient.  Knew I was playing some good stuff.  The greens are quite small, so when you do actually hit them, you've got a good birdie chance.  Hit a lot of the greens on that back nine and gave myself a loft chances.   
 Q.  What particularly pleased you today?  
MATT WALLACE: Probably not even my game.  More my mental.  After last week I played some nice stuff at the Dunhill Links, just kind of struggled to get anything going on the weekend.   
It was kind of going that way on that front nine for me.  But stayed there, stayed patient.  Then the birdies came on the back nine.   
 Q.  What does that do for confidence for the rest of the week?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, good.  I'm in good shape.  I mean, I'm playing some nice stuff.  If I can keep my head and keep giving myself chances, hopefully the putts will drop.
