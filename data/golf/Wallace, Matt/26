 Q.  Four birdies in the last five, it was a great finish from you today?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, lovely finish.  Managed to turn it around off a couple bogeys there to get back into a rhythm.  Hit some great drives, good putts and set it up, and that's my first round around DP here, first time on the Earth Course, so pretty happy with that.   
 Q.  You mentioned in the week, it's your first time here.  Was there a case of feeling your way into the course a little bit today?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, it's tough visually I think.  Saying to Dave on a few holes where you can attack the pin, it looks like you shouldn't attack it, but Dave's like, no, you need to get on with it and attack this.  That will free me up a little bit; the more I play this place.   
 Q.  Obviously it's been a great year, three wins, tied fifth last week.  You're bringing good form into this week.  Did you set yourself any expectations?  
MATT WALLACE: No expectations.  It's the worst thing I've done this year is set goals and expectations.  I guess with greater success comes higher expectation, and I put myself under too much pressure sometimes.   
I said it last week and said it this week; I've got no expectations and I'm playing great.  I'm just going to play golf and it's seeing me well.   
 Q.  Bearing in mind the strength of the field this week, how nice would it be to have a successful week?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, it's very strong.  Seeing some great players here.  If I can keep playing the way I am, it will be nice to see how I go up against these guys around here.  As I say, my first time here and it will cap off a great year if I can have a nice finish.
