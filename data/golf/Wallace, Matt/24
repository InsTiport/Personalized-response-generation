Q. I presume the word "frustration" is one that springs to mind for the rest of the round?
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, absolutely.  But I'm forgetting about that now and we go tomorrow.
Q. That's the thing, the mental side, isn't it, where you say right, we go again and you're still nicely placed despite the fact that you -- and you still shot under par today?
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, exactly.  I'm sorry to be really blunt but I'm literally not thinking about what's just happened.  I've got 18 holes to play tomorrow and I'm going to try and beat everyone.
Q. One last question.  How excited are you about the prospect of those last 18 holes tomorrow?
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, really looking forward to it.  I like the challenge and I know what I need to do.
