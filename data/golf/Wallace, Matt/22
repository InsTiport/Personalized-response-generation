 Q.  A round of 69.  When we chatted going down the back nine, you were hoping to take advantage of the back nine.  How much do you think you did?  
MATT WALLACE: That was probably about par, I'd say, with how far behind I was.  I needed that just to stay in contention really.  I'm not sure what the guys can probably get to now, but 3-under was probably about par.  I left everything in the jaws short which was frustrating, so hopefully they will drop tomorrow.   
 Q.  How much were you being dragged along playing with Haotong, because he was generally leading or thereabouts.  
MATT WALLACE: From the start, I fell behind really fast and he was playing great golf, 4-under the front nine, or 3-under until the bogey at 9 was seriously impressive.  I just had to stick to my own game plan.   
 Q.  Tied second at the DP World took you into the world's Top-50 for the first time, with it came a Masters invite.  Is one of the main objectives now to consolidate yourself into the Top-50 and make sure you're in the big events from now on?  
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, absolutely.  After the WGC, there's Arnold Palmer, THE PLAYERS, got to stay inside the Top-50.  But it would be nice going into those events with some form.   
I just said to Dave on 18 after the tee shot, I said it's good to get the season started off and get the juices flowing and being in contention and hopefully have a chance tomorrow.
