Q. Hard way to kick things off today.  That putt was about 100 feet on the 2nd.
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, I think they said it was about 85 feet, so nice one for the stats.
Q. How tough is that start here, especially into the wind?
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, that 2nd hole is really tough to hit the fairway.  The lay-up is tough, and I think it was just brutal anyway today with the wind, especially with how fast the greens are and the wind buffeting off the side.  I had a testing four-footer downhill right to left with the wind down out of the right on the 1st which I managed to hole, otherwise it might have been off the green.  Really tough.  Really happy with how I'm playing, though.  I felt like I left quite a few shots out there today, so that's a positive.
Q. You said yesterday you wanted to figure some things out.  Were you able to do that, and what were they?
MATT WALLACE: Yeah, well, I actually had the afternoon off because I was quite tired, and my grandma died yesterday morning, so that was quite tough.  And today was a hard one to get through.  I'm playing with a heavy heart this weekend, but I'm playing for her.
