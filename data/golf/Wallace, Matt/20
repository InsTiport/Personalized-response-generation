 Q.  It's all about the putts you make, they don't have to be for birdie, could be for pars, could be for bogey.  I thought the bogey putt there at 13 and of course that putt at 17 really kept the round going.  How much confidence did that give you?  
MATT WALLACE: Massive.  I've just been told over there I made about 150 foot of putts out there today, which it didn't feel like it because some of them were for bogeys, some for par, you know.  But that's what I try and do, I try and grind until the end.  I've got a Man United ball mark this week and it just shows what they did last week is, whenever I look at it, I go, that, we fight to the end, no matter what it is.  That putt on 13 was huge.  I gave it a fist pump, I started hitting myself.  Because, ultimately, I just hit a bad shot, it went in the water and that was it.  And I was like, okay, let's not do anymore of them and I played okay coming in.   
 Q.  69 today, it looked like the golf course got more difficult.  What was challenging about it?  
MATT WALLACE: The greens.  Firm, super firm.  I hit a lob wedge into 16 and it just went forward.  Full lob wedge, struck it well into the wind and it went forward about seven yards.  So, yeah, the greens really firmed up out there.
