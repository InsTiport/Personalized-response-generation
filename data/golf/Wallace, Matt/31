 Q.  A little bit of frustration?  
MATT WALLACE: Massively.  I played pretty bad that back nine.  Lots of pars.  Lots of long-range birdie putts not going in, a couple close ones at the end.  And then bogeyed the last, which isn't the nicest way to finish, but I'm trying to forget it as quick as possible.  We've got Carnoustie tomorrow.  Seen some good scores out there today.  Try and jump up that leaderboard to give us a chance at St. Andrews on Sunday.   
 Q.  Difference between the two days?  Yesterday was windy and today was calm, was that part of the frustration?  
MATT WALLACE: Yesterday was brutal and I played really nice.  Today was gettable.  I played okay the front nine, gave myself chances and didn't get anything going.  Kind of my head got in the way today of myself.  Wanted to make some birdies and didn't, and then tried to get back into a routine and just couldn't get it going today.   
 Q.  Are you going to head up to the range, and if you are, what are going to work on?  
MATT WALLACE: I'm pretty tired actually.  Yesterday was hard.  It was hard work and I felt like I played well.  Today, again was a graft and it was more mental fatigue today.  Might do a little bit of practise.
