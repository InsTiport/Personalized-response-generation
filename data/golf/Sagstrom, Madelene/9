 Q.  Pernilla, Madelene, first two matches did not quite go your way.  This unfinished match this afternoon certainly is going your way.  What has been the different today, Pernilla.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: We just finally felt like we got some momentum.  We had kind of a rough start to both -- early on in the rounds, both rounds 1 and 2, and then this round we finally was up early, at least just one up early, so just felt like we finally got ahead a little bit.  I would say that's the difference.  And just more holes where we were both giving ourselves chances.  Madelene would hit it up close so finally freed me up a little bit, or the other way around.   
 Q.  Long day, you both knew that heading into it.  Having had a loss this morning, how did you turn around and have a positive attitude coming in to the third round match this afternoon?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I mean, we chatted a little bit, and we know we're better than what we've been scoring so far and playing, so we just talked about it, and I think the biggest thing was that we just needed momentum, like Pernilla was saying.  We're both grinders, and we've got each other's back, and now we've really got each other's back.  We're really just trying to get the momentum and trying to stay focused and just stay patient.   
 Q.  Of course golf is an outdoor game.  You never know what Mother Nature is doing.  We know there could be some developments overnight.  We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.  You just have to go with the flow really?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, we'll be ready to tee it up whenever they tell us to tee it up, and yeah, just hope for the best.   
 Q.  It must be great seeing your other two teammates having such a positive display so far this week?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: We knew that Anna and Caroline was a great team, and they've been really showing off that the pairing has been working out, and now we're trying to follow up with our part.  Hopefully we can get the W tomorrow and they can turn theirs around.
