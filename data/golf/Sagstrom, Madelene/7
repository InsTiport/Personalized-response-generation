Q. This time a year ago Madelene was making her debut at the Women's British Open.  She was being announced as a rookie for the European Solheim Cup team.  Fast forward 12 months, rounds of 69 and 70, you found yourself at 5-under par.  How pleased are you with your progress?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Oh, I'm real excited to be at the spot that I am at right now.  I've worked really hard over the last few months, and I'm really excited to be back in and feel that little heat again on the golf course.  So it's fun.
Q. Talk about working hard, Tom Abbott was just saying on the air how you arrived over here quite a few weeks ago and you actually watched the men's Scottish Open at Gullane before you then played there last week.  What did you learn from that experience?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Well, so I worked with Robert Karlsson, and it was fun to be out there and watching him play and just like seeing the whole environment.  I saw Gullane a week before, which was nice, too, for my Scottish.  But just to get that extra little feeling, okay, what did they do really good.  And it was really fun just to see guys played compared to girls, and it's just a good experience to watch golf.  I don't do it enough, and I think there's so much to learn being outside the ropes, too.
Q. You've been working with Robert for a long time.  What advice does he give you for links golf in particular?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I think the biggest advice is just to stay patient.  Like anything can happen, and the wind can switch within seconds, so I think it's just staying patient and just like really working those soft shots, because just hanging under the wind, whenever it starts blowing is really good.  But patience is just key.  Take it as it is and just find good spots if you can and just take your medicine when you have to.
Q. And you mentioned weather to me when you just walked up for this interview.  It has been a little bit trickier than perhaps we were expecting this week.  How have the conditions been to play so far?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I actually find it really nice.  Like you never know what to expect when you get to a links course, and I just really think it's been kind of the same wind for two days now, so that's been generous.  But I mean it's a tough golf course.  Like once you're in the fairway bunker, you just gotta play yourself out.  So I think it's a give or take in how aggressive you dare to be.  So it's been fun.  But yeah, you never know what's going to happen over the weekend either.
Q. They promise the sun will shine for you on the weekend.  Good playing so far, Madelene.
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Thank you very much.
