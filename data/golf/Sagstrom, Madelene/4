Q. All right.  Able to pull a comfortable round, be one shot back of the lead at the end of the day.  How were you feeling out there?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I felt really good.  Starting to feel confident in my game and I hit some really good drives; made a lot of good putts.
But, I mean, the course is lovely and I love it here.  I feel really comfortable out here.
Q. When did you realize that maybe your confidence level was kind of boosting?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I mean, I've worked hard this week.  My coach is in town, and so we worked hard on really trying to have a different attitude, going up to the shots like you know what I'm doing and not doubting it.
I've been putting mindset into play and it's obviously working so I'm just going to keep doing that.
Q. Is it really motivating to have him out here and have that kind of support?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Oh, definitely.  This is one of my favorite weeks of the year.  I have a lot of family here and a lot the support from housing and just people I know.
So it's obviously great to hear those little screams in the background.
Q. This is the beginning of a long summer stretch.  How much is this round in your mind going into the weekend of how well you were able to put together some putts and also just an altogether good round?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I mean, every time you play well and hit some clutch putts I think that adds confidence.  I've worked hard this whole year and I've had some up and downs, but I really like where I am right now so I'm just kind of hoping it stays.
Q. What is there to improve for tomorrow?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I hit a few bad wedges in the end, so I'm just going to try to get the ball closer to the hole, give myself some more opportunities, and just keep striking the ball.
Q. Seemed like the wind was kind of on and off today.
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Yeah.
Q. Was that kind of right?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: And then in here it gets a little swirly.  You're standing here like, Hmmm, what is it doing now?  Definitely more wind yesterday afternoon I would say.
So but it died down a little bit in the end.  It was more when we started midday.
Q. Was that a tougher-than-it-looked putt on 18?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Oh, on my last?  The first one or second one?
Q. The second one coming down.
MADELENE SAGSTROM: No, I mean, it was a pretty clear break, but, I mean, I felt confident with it.  I saw it, kind of saw the line from the back when I hit my first putt.
I knew I hit the putts well today, so just tried to find the line and go for it and see if I was right, and I was.
