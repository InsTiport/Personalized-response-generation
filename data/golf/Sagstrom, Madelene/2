  Q. You're now off the course after one round with Annika.  How are you feeling as defending champion?  What was that experience like for you today?
 MADELENE SAGSTROM:   I was thinking about it before, and it's kind of like that like we're in America on the LPGA Tour and the three current -- well, best of all-time with the current top ranked Swedes are in the same group.  It's amazing to have that experience.  And just playing with Annika, it's amazing.  Her wedge game is so stupidly good still.  I'm going to get some advice and then go from there.
 No, I'm just really proud of our country right now and just like showing that you can come from a small place.  If you don't have -- like would you say if you don't think you have the right resources, you can make it to the big stage, and it's really cool.
