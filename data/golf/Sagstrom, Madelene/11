Q. Just how did you reflect on the match.  It was pretty close at one point?
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Yeah, no, I was really, really nervous in the beginning.  It got to me a lot.  So I was struggling to, like, let it loose and switch over.  I had to really pull the trigger.  And she played really well in the beginning.
So I'm happy I ended up with some good shots in the end, and I kind of contributed.  But the U.S. team played great.  We tried really hard.  We never gave up until the last putt.  Obviously we're disappointed.  But we tried our best and just today wasn't enough.
Q. Can I get a few words, Jodi?  Reflections on the round?  You played really well; you just --
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Played well, hit the ball well.  Danielle putted amazingly.  I mean, not much you can do against it.  So overall disappointed.  Obviously we'd like to get the point.  But happy with where my game is.  Hopefully tomorrow (inaudible).
Q. And obviously tight, those two, aren't they?  Really good friends?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, obviously it helps.  So, I mean, like I said, Danielle just played great.  And you know, if she was out of the hole, Michelle was there.  So, it's hard to be up against that.
