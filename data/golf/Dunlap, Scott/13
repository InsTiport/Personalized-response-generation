Q. How was it out there?SCOTT DUNLAP: Hot, windy, sticky.  You know, started to very much resemble Open golf.  Greens were getting quite firm and hard to get near pins and nerves get frayed.  It's a joy.  (Laughter.)Q. Looking at the scoreboard and the conditions you just experienced, looks like it's going to be a similar day tomorrow.SCOTT DUNLAP: Right.Q. Do you expect similar scores, similar sort of day tomorrow?SCOTT DUNLAP: Yeah.  I mean, what Gene -- did anyone else really do anything?  Looked like Marco had it going, back around par, settling around par. Today I suspected I'd be nervous and I was.  I figured I'd probably get off to a dodgy start and I did, but, you know, knowing that, I just hung in there and I did that, as well. Hopefully tomorrow might be a little bit more of a positive day, but, yeah, if it's going to blow 25, positive might still be shooting something over par.  Who knows?  We will take it a hole at a time and see what happens.Q. What had you nervous?SCOTT DUNLAP: What had me nervous?  U.S. Senior Open, third day, last group.  Not usually -- you know, I have been somewhat in that position, but it's been a long time, like maybe 2000 with Tiger at a PGA.  It's just nature, you know. A lot of guys won't own up to it, but, you know, when you watch them shoot 75 and don't look like the same guy two days ago, it wasn't just a calendar flip.
