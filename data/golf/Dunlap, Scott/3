 Q. So obviously not the tee shot you wanted to hit on 18. What happened with that shot?   
SCOTT DUNLAP: I took the 4 iron out for the 3 iron in regulation. It was a perfect 5 just screaming downwind, and it wasn't so much down. I think I warmed back up. I took enough practice swings. I don't think I was tight, but I think I was trying to force it and got out a little ahead of it.   
3 iron was too much, and 5 wasn't enough. So I was trying to squeeze more out of the 5 than I probably could.  
   
 Q. Regardless of the result, it's good to get in that situation at this point in the season, isn't it?   
SCOTT DUNLAP: No doubt. The whole week is a big success. I don't think I played particularly well here last year, just kind of taking up one of the spots last year. In terms of breaking off some rust and thinking about looking forward to the Florida swing on our tour. This is very helpful.  
   
 Q. What do you take away from this week that you will hopefully use as you start the regular season in a couple weeks?   
SCOTT DUNLAP: Sometimes you're more ready when the year goes‑‑ when the gun goes off each year. You don't really know why or why these things happen. Hopefully, I'm in better shape getting started after this week than I might have otherwise been. You take it just one week at a time, and this was a good one. Post the victories when you can get them.
