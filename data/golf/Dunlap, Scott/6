 Q.  Can you tell me about your feelings about waiting all day?  
SCOTT DUNLAP: What can you do, you know?  You looked at that line.  It looked like it was riding up, and then, no, it kind of sank, kept on coming.  Just play when the gun goes off and be ready.  At this stage of our lives in the game, what can you do?   
 Q.  Have you been through situations like this before on Tour, and how did you handle it?  
SCOTT DUNLAP: Oh, sure.  Probably the best thing is that we didn't play.  I mean, I always hated the disjointed -- I'm always the kind of guy that like, when play's ending, can you finish the last hole?  Yeah, just the idea of starting in the middle of something just always kind of seems unpalatable.   
So I think it's probably best that nothing happened today.  Start fresh tomorrow, hopefully.  I think the weather is supposed to be better, maybe at least in the morning.  So come 1:00, we'll have finished a USGA event, and we'll all be happy, and someone will be a winner, and we'll all go on our merry way.   
 Q.  Obviously, there's a gap in the days that you play.  How does that affect your mental approach going into tomorrow?  
SCOTT DUNLAP: It doesn't.  The golf course will be different, won't it?  In fact, Jeff Gallagher was saying he hit driver on every hole Monday and was picking up mud.  I didn't play until Wednesday, and it was bone dry and ball's running.  It will be back to soft, hitting some different clubs off tees in probably some different places.   
So that's probably the biggest change how the golf course will be different than when we last got on it.
