Q. You had a pretty consistent round today.  Had a stretch of birdies in there.  Can you speak to that first.
SCOTT DUNLAP: Yeah, it took awhile to finally hole a putt.  The opportunities presented themselves earlier than I finally took advantage of one.  Then started feeling pretty good, giving myself some chances.  So after the first couple went in I loosened up a little bit and had some good opportunities and I ended up with three in a row.
Q. Anything unusual about those three?
SCOTT DUNLAP: No.
Q. Just good iron shots?
SCOTT DUNLAP: A nice up-and-down at 16 with a pulled iron shot over there in the hay.  That would have been a real bummer to let that go.  But an unforced error right in the middle of the fairway with a 6-iron.  And right after those three birdies that would have been a real bummer and kind of probably let the air out.  So it was nice to get that par immediately after the hat trick.
Q. Were you finding that the weather change really helped you on the position for your iron shots coming in?
SCOTT DUNLAP: The greens are still, they're nice underneath and the ball is still releasing, so I don't think that's made any difference.  It wasn't going to be firm and fast anyway.  So, I don't think, other than just some wet fairways, there's really anything different.
Q. This course obviously is the first time we have had a Major on this golf course.  Just your feelings about how you managed yourself around it.
SCOTT DUNLAP: Yeah, I played it yesterday and it's a good, solid, straightforward golf course.  There's no tricks to it.  A lot of good motion in the greens.  So, yeah, we got a good break with the tee boxes, because it was going to play so long.  So there's a whole lot more of the golf course we could have played that would have toughened it up.  But 4-under, can't complain.
