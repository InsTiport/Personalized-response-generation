 Q. Talk about coming to this event to start off the year.  
SCOTT DUNLAP: I can't think of a better way to start the season. This golf course, Diamond Resorts, this event. Baseball players, they want to talk about golf. Golfers want to talk about baseball. It's just a lot of fun, and really I can't think of a better way to get the year started.   
Obviously, it worked for me, having a nice week. SO looking forward to it.  
   
 Q. You made a fantastic birdie on the last. What was going on there?   
SCOTT DUNLAP: In this format, obviously, you just try and make as many threeâ€‘pointers for the birdies. Those last holes are downwind, and they're gettable. So you need to be moving forward and luckily, I did. We'll see if it's enough.  
   
 Q. Are you going to wait around and see how it all pans out?   
SCOTT DUNLAP: Scotty Parel, as long as he is, he's going to make at least a 4 on number 17, if not a 3. So I have a sneaky suspicion I might have come up a little bit short, but I did everything I could.  
   
 Q. We enjoyed watching you. Thanks for your time.
