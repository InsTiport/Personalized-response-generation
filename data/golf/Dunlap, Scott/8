Q. Talk about the final round for yourself.SCOTT DUNLAP: Well, probably just proved what I've known all along.  I can hit it good enough to win.  I've got to putt it better.Q. How was the course set up today compared to the other days?SCOTT DUNLAP: About the same.  I guess the USGA doesn't do just as nasty as we can get on a Sunday.  It's just some up, some back, and good pins like it is every other day.  A little less wind today, and, of course, the last round, guys are chasing so you see some low scores.  But it was every bit as gettable as the rest of the week.Q. How did you feel as the week finished out, the golf course, and everything else?SCOTT DUNLAP: If anybody's got something to complain about this week, well, then, they just can't be happy.  The golf course is perfect.  What a great venue.  Couldn't be set up better.  Just mint condition, very fair, a lot of fun to play.  Just awesome.
