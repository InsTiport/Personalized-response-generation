 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the round today?  
JENNIFER HA: Yeah, it started off pretty good.  I made birdie on 12, and that put me at 1-under, and I was feeling pretty comfortable there.  Unfortunately, coming in I made a couple bad tee shots, hit a couple right and made a couple bogeys from hard spots.  Chipped in for bogey though.  That was pretty cool.   
 Q.  What was the crowd like?  Obviously playing at home, what is it like?  
JENNIFER HA: Yeah, it's awesome.  I stepped on to the tee and everyone knew my name.  That was cool.  The home support here is amazing.  Even though I'm not from Ottawa, people came out and cheered me on and that was great to see.   
 Q.  Obviously the round today plus-3, what are your thoughts on the round tomorrow?  
JENNIFER HA: I think I can take it really deep tomorrow.  I've been hitting the ball well.  Just a couple errant shots here and there.  But I think I can go a little more.
