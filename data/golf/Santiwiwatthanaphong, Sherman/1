Q. Tell me a little bit about the round today.  Do you feel like the scores are out there?  I guess how do you feel today went for you?
SHERMAN SANTIWIWATTHANAPHONG: Actually today I made a lot of mistake and I didn't hit the shot like good like yesterday.  I also miss a lot of putt but still shot under par, so it's good day.
Q. Last year you were up there on the leaderboard; you're still up there in contention this year.  What about this course works for you, works for your game?
SHERMAN SANTIWIWATTHANAPHONG: I really like the golf course, like around here.  I mean, the green is soft so I can just hit the distant to the pin and it's just stuck in there, so I like that, the way the greens soft and the way the fairways little bit wide for me.  Yeah.
Q. You won up in Harris a couple years ago; Emma won last year; Dani won the year before.  You're all up there.  Is there some kind of good vibes, good feelings for all of you when you come to this part of the country?
SHERMAN SANTIWIWATTHANAPHONG: Yeah, I mean, I always feeling good here, because I mean, like this year, some of the people is like, Ah, it's you.  Did you (indiscernible) like last two year in Harris?  I was like, Yeah.  So I get some fan here.
