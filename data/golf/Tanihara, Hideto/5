HIDETO TANIHARA: Basically the wind was blowing the other way, so it was hard to judge the second shots and the pin positions were not easy.  It was really hard to play.  But I guess at the end I was able to get the two birdies and was able to win the match at the end.
Q. Talk about Ross Fisher?
HIDETO TANIHARA: First time.  Don't know, only that he's really good.
