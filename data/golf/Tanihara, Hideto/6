Q. You were in a very interesting group.  All Japanese match.  That was a very important win.  Your group was very complicated as to how it might work out today.
HIDETO TANIHARA: I knew I had to win to get through, so I just needed to play really well and play really well today.
Q. How much do you enjoy match play?
HIDETO TANIHARA: I like playing against people who are good and it's really enjoying.  I'm just glad that I'm playing really well and moving forward.
Q. Are you and Ikeda friends?  And if so, was it difficult to play against him?
HIDETO TANIHARA: I see him every day back many Japan.  It's weird to play out of the country with a fellow countryman, but it was comfortable playing with him.  It was pretty fun.
Q. Great win.  A lot of luck on the weekend.
HIDETO TANIHARA: Thank you.
