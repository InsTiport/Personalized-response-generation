 Q.  Just your thoughts on the match in general.  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I was able to play with the top players and I just enjoyed it, and it was really fun playing out there.   
 Q.  Satisfying to earn your best finish on the PGA Tour?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I got to play with Dustin, Jordan, Phil, they're all great players.  And just losing, still it was a great match.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the hole in one and also the shot on No. 12, the second shot, the reaction of the crowd?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: The hole-in-one, the crowd, they went wild.  And when everybody is happy, you tend to get happy, too.  So it was a great feeling.  You can't really always make a hole-in-one.  You try but you usually miss.  But sometimes you just get lucky and it went in.  I'm just really happy that it went in.   
For the second shot on 12, it was the last match, I had nothing to lose, just attack the pin and just had a great shot.   
 Q.  Obviously you talked about being around Jordan, what sort of confidence does that give you going forward?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Had a great shot going in with the irons.  All in all, good confidence.  But we've got to see for the next tournament, it's a different whole story.  You've got to take it each at a time.  So we'll see how it goes.  But a good boost.   
 Q.  How many hole-in-ones, how many aces in your career in tournaments, in competition?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Two.   
 Q.  Two times before, both in Japan?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Yes.  One in Japan and one here.   
 Q.  Where was the previous one?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Taiheiyo Visa tournament.   
 Q.  Do you remember what year?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I don't know.   
 Q.  When we talked yesterday, you said the Presidents Cup wasn't on his radar, but --  
HIDETO TANIHARA: It is now.   
 Q.  Have you met Captain Nick Price?  Have you met him or played with him?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: No.   
 Q.  Soon.  At Augusta.
