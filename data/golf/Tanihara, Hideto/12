  HIDETO TANIHARA:   I don't know the reason why my putts were going in on the back nine.   I have no idea what changes I made.   I have no idea.   
Without thinking too much about it, the putts started going in.   
Regarding the 6th hole, 200 yards, the second shot, I used a 7‑iron from the rough.   I was able to get a clean shot out of the rough on the 6th hole with a 7‑iron.   
Regarding the first nine‑‑ I wasn't hitting it very well today, either front or back side.   
   
 Q.   What made the difference between the first and second half?   
HIDETO TANIHARA:   I have no idea.   I have no idea why I could turn it around.   I have nothing, no reason why I started playing well.   
   
 Q.   Was there a swing change or nothing?  
HIDETO TANIHARA:   No, nothing that I made consciously that made the difference between the first half and second half.   
Today was up and down.   I hit some good shots and I hit some bad shots.   I've been trying this new hook grip, trying to keep it left, trying not to push out as much.   
I feel very fortunate and lucky with this round, with this score.
