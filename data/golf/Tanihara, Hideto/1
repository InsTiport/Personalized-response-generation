 Q.  What was the key to your round?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I didn't make any bogeys.  That's the key today.   
 Q.  It's your first time playing here in Abu Dhabi.  How much did you enjoy being in Abu Dhabi and enjoy the course here?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: It's a tough course here.  Didn't hit fairways so much but I'm thinking more about playing smart golf and making good putts.  Aoki, he won on The European Tour, and I'm just trying to focus on winning on The European Tour.
