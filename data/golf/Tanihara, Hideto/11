 Q.   Nice playing, great round out there today.   If I can just get some overall comments.   
HIDETO TANIHARI:   The putting was great for today and yesterday, and the shot was okay, but putting was it for me.  
   
 Q.   A great stretch on 7, 8 and 9 with three birdies and then also to close out the round with a really good birdie there on 18.   
HIDETO TANIHARI:   My shot was not as good as I thought it would be, but putting really helped me to get to this point.   Putting is a key this week.   
   
 Q.   Just one shot off the lead.   How excited are you going into the last two rounds?   
HIDETO TANIHARI:   Of course I feel good, but I'm going to keep myself down, and I'm going to play my best for the next two days.
