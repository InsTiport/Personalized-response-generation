HIDETO TANIHARA: It was a great day.  I guess we were able to birdie all the long par 5s.   
 Q.  What are you enjoying most about playing links golf?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Links course, it's kind of a good practice before the British Open, and because the weather's nice, it's really fun to play out here.  It's different from other courses.  It's really fun.   
 Q.  You've won on the Japanese Tour.  What would it mean to you to win on The European Tour?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I've never won on foreign soil, so it would be a great one to win.  Especially with all of these great players including Matsuyama and all these players.  Hopefully it will be a good day tomorrow.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about that round of golf?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I was able to birdie all the par 5s and I think that got to a good score today.   
 Q.  Two dropped shots all week.  How important is it to keep the bogeys off the card?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: It's great to have less bogeys but at the same time, getting a lot of birdies is helping me, and as a golfer, I think I'm pleased with that.   
We have The Open coming up in a couple weeks, and with all of these winds going left and right, it's hard.  But I think it's good practice to play up here before The Open, and just want to enjoy tomorrow and try to get a win.   
 Q.  What are your impressions of The European Tour?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Everybody's friendly out here, so it's fun to play.  Compared to the courses in the States, it's not too lengthy.  It's pretty playable.  So it's fun to play out here, and especially just saying that, everybody is all friendly.  So that's what makes it fun.   
 Q.  Is playing in the DP World Tour Championship one of your goals?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Haven't planned out our schedule but it would be great to play at the year-end final, and actually get to play all kind of courses around Europe.  That's just fun and enjoyable
