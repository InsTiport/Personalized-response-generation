HIDETO TANIHARA: Today was an enjoyable day.  I was look forward to playing.  I knew if I brought my "A" game, I could probably compete against him.  I wanted to see how a top player -- how he would play and I was just look forward the whole day.  Trying to win the whole tournament, you have to go through tough guys.  So just happy to get this win.   
 Q.  He's kind of the hometown guy.  What did you think of the crowds and the atmosphere around this?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: I have a Texas (indiscernible), too, so felt like home too.   
 Q.  What was the hardest part about today?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Today wasn't that bay.  It felt like Jordan didn't play that well.  Glad that we got to play him the first day.   
 Q.  You had a tricky uphill putt on 6 or 7.  
HIDETO TANIHARA: The first hole we evened.  He had a longer putt and I'm surprised that -- he's a good putter.  We played even.  After that I guess Jordan off the tee wasn't hitting as well.  Just thought maybe get a chance, we can get a good shot.   
 Q.  The one on 7, was that a big momentum swing?  
HIDETO TANIHARA: Hole No. 7 was one of the points where I think Jordan wanted to make a good putt.  I think that kind of set the tone.
