  CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Playing the foursomes, Siddikur, tell us about the day.   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Well, it was a really great day for us, me and Anirban.   I was really excited to play with him, one of my best friends on the Tour.   So it was really great and we played really good golf, both of us.   We played really good golf today and we really enjoyed, as well.   Really looking forward to tomorrow.   
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Kiradech, your match with Thongchai, a halve with Miguel and Pablo, that was an exciting match.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   We both did a good job today.   Thongchai was great.   We helped each other really well.   I made a couple putts, and when he missed we can get recovery.   But today it was great golf and a half point and happy with the result.   Hope we are up early on the first couple matches tomorrow.   
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Playing Thomas and ThorbjÃ¸rn, must have been fun for you to put up a point for Asia.  
PRAYAD MARKSAENG:   We have played in Japan and we know each other and today the game is quite well, and the game, it's a good combination for today.   
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Tanihara‑san, a good comeback, were you pleased with that performance?   
HIDETO TANIHARA:     Same as yesterday.   We started out really slow.   We were behind the whole time yesterday, also today we were behind.   But we started playing better.   At one point we were down three and came back and we were up one.   We were looking for a win but they came back with a good birdie on 17.   But tomorrow, I think we'll have a good day tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Is there a belief in the team room that you can go out tomorrow and actually do it, win the event?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Right from the beginning, we have been saying that‑‑ inaudible‑‑ today we did really good and if we can play like today, tomorrow, I think it will be a good fight for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Was the team partnership‑‑ you seemed to combine well.   Was that helpful today?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Well, yeah, obviously it helped me a lot today‑‑ it was very good, we know each other's game from the beginning, and we played good golf.   The last hole we saved to win the match, and I think our whole team did well for today.   
   
 Q.   The last putt from about ten feet, what were your thoughts at that point in time as you were lining up?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Well, I was really confident because I know his game as I said earlier.   My individual position was that ball went in center‑‑ and finally‑‑ before that putt, I told him‑‑ (Inaudible.)  
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Nicholas, views of your match against Graeme and Jamie?   You were up for a long time but team Europe came back to win.   Your thoughts, please?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   We played solid the first six holes.   We was 2‑up until the eighth hole, and missed a short putt on 9.   11, they make a quite long birdie putt to halve the hole.   But 13, 15, 16, I missed a short putt and that's why we lost.   
   
 Q.   When you started today, you had to have some treatment on the putting green from the physio.   Is there any repercussions from that in today's round and will it affect you tomorrow?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   No, just a little swollen in the wrist when hitting the ball on the range.   But before I'm going out, it was fine, really fine.   
   
 Q.   What's your confidence level now like for tomorrow?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I mean, we have a lot of confidence coming back tomorrow.   We can see the golf today, after TJ the captain worked so hard to change the team partner and it turned the golf around.   We almost had five points todaybut Europe kept really strong the whole game, finished the last couple holes.   
But anyway, we get three back, so I still think we can have a point the first couple matches tomorrow, we can change.   
   
 Q.   What's your mind‑set, your first time playing in such matches and tomorrow going into the singles, what's going through your head and how are you mentally preparing for it?   
NICHOLAS FUNG:   Yeah, I think the first‑‑ yesterday I'm playing well, today I'm playing well.   My confidence so good and I'm hitting so well, and tomorrow is a totally different games, because everyone is playing singles, so it's individual games.   
So I'm very confident with my game, so tomorrow, yeah, so I think chance.
