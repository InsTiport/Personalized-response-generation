 Q.   Happy birthday.   
HA NA JANG:   Oh, thank you so much.   It's my good present at No.7, an eagle.   Good present, right?   
   
 Q.   How old are you, 23?  
HA NA JANG:   23.   
   
 Q.   Run me through that shot.   Tell me about that shot.   
HA NA JANG:   No.7?   The distance is 91 flag, so just a little helping breeze, so I hit a 52.   It's like really awesome, really clear, oh, this is tap‑in birdie, definitely tap‑in birdie.   But woohoo, nice eagle, happy birthday everybody.   It's a very good present.   It feels very nice.  
   
 Q.   You had a good celebration, too.   
HA NA JANG:   Yes, really good.  
   
 Q.   You jumped up and down?  
HA NA JANG:   Yeah, I jumped up and down, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you always get that excited on the golf course?  
HA NA JANG:   Yeah, really good.  
   
 Q.   You play with a lot of emotion, don't you?  
HA NA JANG:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Pretty good day out there, though?   
HA NA JANG:   I think today is just a little missed the fairways too much.   I think it's better than yesterday, the iron shots, so I think today is really just a little bit‑‑ putter is big miss today, so I think everything is better, yeah.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be 23?  
HA NA JANG:   I don't think so.   I think it's too old to look at this year, but to ever look the age of 19, 20, very young, but I'm 23 years old.   It's okay, right?   23 is fair age.   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   You had a lot of spin on that shot on 7.   
HA NA JANG:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Do you always spin it that much?   
HA NA JANG:   I think my shot is so much spin every shot, maybe 100 and 90 wedge shots too much spun, but I think No.7 is normal spin, so very good thing about it, yeah.
