Q. You had a great front nine, four birdies.  Can you tell me a little bit about it?
HA NA JANG: Front nine, just be patient every hole, middle of the green and then the fairway.  It was a lot of good play on the first nine.
Then back nine, it was like little, what was it, the slow play at every hole and just waiting on the tee.  So just more not really being patient.  Something like, I'm not try to focus more my ball because it's delayed every hole.
And then just try more birdie, birdie, birdie.  It's really good play on No. 15.  But 16 and 18 is really bad miss right now.
But just second day, I don't want to think about it, the missed shots and missed putts.  So just two days, just more focus the next two days.
Q. Is that what happened on 16, you missed the putt?
HA NA JANG: Yeah, 16, it's my first putt, is just eight yards past the flag.  It's really downhill.  But I'm trying to birdie, but it's really like two, three yards past the hole.  It's really bad, my putt.
And I tried 17, it's not really focus, my ball.  And then 18, too, so it's a little bad, three holes, the last three.
Q. After such a great day.  And then were you put on the clock or anything on the back nine or was it just very slow?
HA NA JANG: It's like at the front nine, just play every hole, no slow play.  But I think back nine is more windy and the more times, really late.  And players a little tired, so walk slow, a little slow, the play at every hole, just stop on the tee box and second shot.
Q. Did it make you rush?
HA NA JANG: Mm-hmm, yes.
Q. But you're still in a great place for tomorrow.
HA NA JANG: Exactly.
