 Q.  You know how many hole-in-ones you've had in your career?  
HA NA JANG: Right now seven times, so...   
 Q.  Seven?  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, and three time in tournament, but first time I won the car.   
 Q.  First time you won a car?  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.  So happy.   
 Q.  How was that?  
HA NA JANG: It was like, I see the ball, and last year I'm not seeing the ball because I'm shorty so I cannot see on the greens.   
Today my balls probably seven yards short of the landing on the back, and they go inside.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm so happy, more than happy.   
And I have a car.  Oh, my God, that one is mine.  I'm so happy.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think it has anything to do with your nickname, being lucky?  
HA NA JANG: I have three, so...   
 Q.  Yep.  
HA NA JANG: Lucky Jang, Energizer Jang, and one more is like Clover Jang.   
That's why I'm lucky.   
 Q.  On St. Patrick's day, too.  
HA NA JANG: Yes, exactly.  And I have the green glove, today so probably lucky.   
 Q.  I saw that.  What was in the yardage and club there?  
HA NA JANG: 140 to the pin and I hit 9-iron.  It's a little bit into the wind.  Swing is perfect, I think more than perfect, so right in the hole.   
 Q.  Did you really work 12 hours a day to get ready for this season?  
HA NA JANG: Not this week because hot weather, so I just went into training every day 13 or 14 hours of practice.   
So, yeah.   
 Q.  How many holes would you play a day?  
HA NA JANG: Every day is 18.  Yeah, 18 every day.  Yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  That's it.  
HA NA JANG: Thank you.
