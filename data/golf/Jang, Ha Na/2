 Q.  Playing in your first major this year, how did the first round go today?  
HA NA JANG: It feels not much different because I think it's just exactly setting the tone.  Sometimes too much thinking about it as a major or something, it's a big tournament, but I don't want to think about it as a big major or something, so it's just exactly the same.   
 Q.  It didn't seem too windy out there today.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  How is the course looking?  
HA NA JANG: I think early tee times today with lucky because the high winds are coming in the afternoon.  But starting on hole No. 13, there's a really strong wind on the golf course.  But I just keep it in play, so I didn't miss shots, so it was pretty good.   
 Q.  How are you going to prepare for tomorrow?  
HA NA JANG: Should be just try to be simple and just be patient every day and every hole.  Yeah, should be good.
