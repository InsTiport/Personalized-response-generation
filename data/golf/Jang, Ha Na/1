 Q.  How does it feel?  
HANA JANG: A little missed shot on hole No. 7, but I don't want to think about some things like that.  I had a really good birdie, made 4, on the back nine, so it was pretty good today.   
 Q.  Even with the split in the middle of the day, you came in with a good round.  
HANA JANG: Yeah, today is like 28 holes of play.  I feel right now it's pretty good because I only start, so it doesn't matter, just playing 18 more is pretty good.   
 Q.  Finishing this way, does that give you a boost for the afternoon?  
HANA JANG: Yeah, exactly.  I think so.  It was a big finish.
