 Q.  Great round today.  
HANA JANG: Yeah, exactly.  No bogey today.  Just yesterday one bogey.  Really good play today.   
But really good last year finish in top 2, so it's really very (indiscernible) and everything is really good.   
 Q.  So what change did you make for the second round?  
HANA JANG: I think just be patient every hole, just fairway and the greens.  Because this golf course really small green.  Just target is middle of the green, so it's really good playing.  Then just par, par, par.  And then tap-in birdie is good.  Birdie is good.  Par is good.  Always just be patient every hole.
