   RHONDA GLENN:  That was a wonderful victory for you.  What do you think of the way your match went?   
 HA NA JENG:  I was just hitting it one shot at a time, hitting the fairway, just trying to get on the fairway first.   
 RHONDA GLENN:  Alexis had a lot of support, a lot of spectators were out to see the 12-year-old girl, but that didn't bother you?   
 HA NA JENG:  I just imagined like nobody was around me, and I just played my own game.   
  
  Q.  Did you play about as well as you can play on the front nine?   
 HA NA JENG:  The front nine was okay, but I could have done a lot better.   
 RHONDA GLENN:  What were you trying to do with your game today?   
 HA NA JENG:  I was just thinking ahead of myself and just plan, and I would just practice -- when I was practicing, I would practice long shots from windy areas to prepare for my game.   
  
  Q.  Practicing on the practice tee here, practicing as if you were playing?   
 HA NA JENG:  As if I were playing.   
  
  Q.  How long have you been in the States?   
 HA NA JENG:  Three months.   
  
  Q.  And where are you staying while you're over here?   
 HA NA JENG:  San Diego.  I played the U.S. Open and U.S. Junior Pub Links and Junior Girls.   
  
  Q.  So you came over just before the U.S. Open?   
 HA NA JENG:  I think so.   
 RHONDA GLENN:  When did you come, what date?   
 HA NA JENG:  June 4.   
  
  Q.  And how does this tournament compare to a women's amateur event in Korea do you think?  What are the differences?   
 HA NA JENG:  It's just the same.   
  
  Q.  How much longer are you staying here before you go back?   
 HA NA JENG:  I'm leaving right after this tournament.   
  
  Q.  What will you try to do tomorrow in the match?   
 HA NA JENG:  I just want to hit it straight and just take one shot at a time, take it easy on myself, not too much pressure.   
  
  Q.  Do you know Maria Uribe?   
 HA NA JENG:  Yeah, I know her.   
  
  Q.  Ever play against her?   
 HA NA JENG:  No.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever played with her?   
 HA NA JENG:  No.   
  
  Q.  You outdrove Alexis by quite a bit.  Do you think you put a lot of pressure on her?   
 HA NA JENG:  No, I don't think I put any pressure on her.   
  
  Q.  Describe your personality on the golf course.  It seems like you're very emotional, you fist pump and you're smiling and happy.  Describe your personality on the golf course.   
 HA NA JENG:  I can't really tell because I don't realize it (laughing).   
  
  Q.  Do you know if you want to play college golf here or just turn professional eventually?   
 HA NA JENG:  I don't know yet, but I probably might do Korean college.   
  
  Q.  When would that be?   
 HA NA JENG:  About three years.
