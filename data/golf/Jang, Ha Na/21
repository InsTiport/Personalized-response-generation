 Q.  How does it feel, win No. 2?  
HA NA JANG: It's amazing right now, because last, eagle, is very fun, very enjoy, exciting in my mind.  It's very comfortable today but it's really, really happy this year because two wins right now, very happy.   
 Q.  Since when have you been planning celebration No. 2, what went into that?  
HA NA JANG: Second celebration, I'm not sure.  Just this week, I'm listening to like Beyonce's music.  So I'm watching the football game, Super Bowl, I'm watching the concert, looks really nice.  Looks same as my right hip, so I'm try like Beyonce, the single lady.  I'm single right now, too, I try the single lady.   
 Q.  What about today, just very solid overall, so many birdies.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, like No. 11, sometimes it's happening, a bogey, so a really good save, it's a bogey.  Talk to my caddie, he always say, Ha Na, just be patient, just be patient, don't think about another player and another score.  So I'm very comfortable.   
 Q.  What a way to finish in style with the eagle on the last.  
HA NA JANG: It's great, fantastic today, and an eagle finish is very amazing in my mind, yes, very lovely.   
 Q.  This has been quite an exceptional year in 2016.  You've played five events on the LPGA Tour and you've won twice.  What's been the difference?  
HA NA JANG: Just be patient every day and practice a little more, and very hard practice.  Then really comfortable this year, really good play.   
 Q.  Your driving of the ball was excellent but your ability to drain some very long putts out there, too.  
HA NA JANG: It's amazing, I don't see it before.  My putts really amazing today.   
 Q.  Your energy lived up to the energy of the HaNa-Gizer.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, my nickname is HaNa-Gizer.  I'm in a very strong and happy space, yeah.
