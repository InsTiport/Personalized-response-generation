 Q.  Tough day today.  I noticed you having problems with your feet.  
HANA JANG: The par 3, the 15th, I'm just hitting 7-iron and just a little slide on my foot, so bad right now, so I don't want to talk about it right now.  Feels pretty good right now.  It's fine.   
 Q.  All in all, you had some highlights to the day, and you started off well.  Can you talk about how you were feeling coming to the turn?  
HANA JANG: Today finished pretty good.  Top five finish is pretty good but the last, bad miss, but I don't want to think about the bad miss.  Just think about the good birdie, make birdie today and feeling is good.  Probably next year is more better than this year, so maybe better score next year.   
 Q.  So you enjoyed the experience of being defending champion?  
HANA JANG: Yeah, Inbee, she's a really nice play, her putter is really good, awesome.  I played good but she's awesome today, that's why.
