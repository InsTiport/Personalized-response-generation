 Q.  I know the last couple rounds you've closed with a bogey each day.  How do you get over that disappointment and get ready for the next day?  
HA NA JANG: I think same missed shot.  It's a little sad, but it's okay just the second day.  So I think too much thinking is exactly the same like yesterday and today's rough so I was more thinking the third shot and a little miss today on the last hole and tee just inside edger.  But sometimes it's happening.  It's no problem, there are two more days, no problem yet.   
 Q.  I know you have no trouble going out to the range and the putting green working on things.  What will your focus be heading into the weekend on your game?  
HA NA JANG: I think iron shots are really nice this week, but I think a little more focus on my driver because very narrow the fairway this golf course.  So I think it's more focusing on the fairway and it will be a really good score.   
 Q.  So front nine you came out strong.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, I think the front nine just every hole just be patient.  It's not really rush it, just play golf.  But I more tried to rush the back nine and the little missed shot and sometimes the little miss shot.  But just be patient every hole, but it was a really big miss the last hole off the tee.  It's okay.  There are two more days.  It's no problem.   
 Q.  So you're on the tee, what occurred?  
HA NA JANG: Last on the tee I just hit a 16 hybrid, but inside the edge of left side of the fairway, a little bit miss.  But it's okay, more practice, and I think it's better tomorrow.
