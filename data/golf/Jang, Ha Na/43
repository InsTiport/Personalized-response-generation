   RHONDA GLENN:  Ha Na, congratulations for getting to the semifinal.  I know you go from here over to the scoreboard, you get a nice medal, which is a wonderful achievement for you.  It looked as if you hurt your wrist or your hand, right hand, on the second shot on 15.  What happened there? 
 HA NA JANG:  The bunker, the hill, the ball a little bit right there's a stone, so punch shot and -- 
 RHONDA GLENN:  I could tell it hurt on the next shot.  Is it okay now, or does it continue to hurt? 
 HA NA JANG:  It's a little bit hurt. 

 Q.  Your right wrist, right hand? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yeah. 

 Q.  How big was the rock? 
 HA NA JANG:  It was small. 

 Q.  Like a baseball size? 
 HA NA JANG:  No (indicating three inches in diameter), like an egg. 
 RHONDA GLENN:  You've done very well in this championship.  I know you wanted to win today.  What was the difference?  Why do you think you lost the match? 
 HA NA JANG:  The driver was too much left, No. 8, No. 9.  It was a driver push, same 10, 11, 12, every hole the driver miss. 
 RHONDA GLENN:  To the right? 
 HA NA JANG:  To the left.  I struggled with my driver with hole 8, 9 and 10, but I think on 16 it went my way, so it was kind of my hole. 

 Q.  What were your impressions of Maria and her game? 
 HA NA JANG:  Good player, too much good player, too much lucky today, good putter and driver straight, fairway, green. 

 Q.  What will you take away from this week?  What will you remember about this week?  What was important to you? 
 HA NA JANG:  I really appreciated all the volunteers coming out and the wonderful hospitality that the club provided and the town, and also the golf course was great.  It's a lot better than some of the courses I practice on in Korea. 

 Q.  Did you think you had won 16 and 17? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yes, No. 17, yes.  And 16 the par, yes.  And play 17 -- I thought I was going to get one back on 17. 

 Q.  How long was your putt on 17? 
 HA NA JANG:  My putt was four yards.  Maria, I think, had 20 yards to the hole. 

 Q.  When she made that, were you in shock?  I know you were kind of upset right there on the spot, on the green, but what were your emotions when that putt went in? 
 HA NA JANG:  Shock.  I was in shock. 

 Q.  Sometimes when we've played under a lot of pressure for a long time, a lot of matches, that's when the emotions come out.  It's not necessarily one shot.  Was it just you're tired and you've played so hard?  Is that why you got a little upset? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yes. 

 Q.  Didn't Maria make a long putt on 16, too? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yeah, 16, ten yards, par putt. 

 Q.  Was that kind of shocking, too? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yeah.  Yes, too much. 

 Q.  What's next?  Will you go back to Korea? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yeah, back to Korea, tomorrow, I think. 

 Q.  Are you homesick?  Sad about being away and want to go home? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yes. 

 Q.  Be back with your family? 
 HA NA JANG:  Yes, my family only one is my mom, mom and dog. 

 Q.  How long were you over here, all summer then? 
 HA NA JANG:  Three months. 
 RHONDA GLENN:  Ha Na, congratulations, you had a wonderful week.
