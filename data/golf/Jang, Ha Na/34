 Q.  What did you think of your round today?  
HA NA JANG: I think today's really good round because no bogey today.  Just six birdies straight, so I think it's two weeks go I win Korea tournament, so it's a little bit more confident.   
No pressure today.  It's like a little more simple.  It's areally good round today.   
 Q.  What tournament was that that you won in Korea?  
HA NA JANG: The Volvik tournament.   
 Q.  Oh, okay.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.  Like so many LPGA Tour players coming to Korea, so really good tournament.  Very enjoy.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you feel like that'll help you get over the hump?  I know you have been frustrated that you had some seconds, but you got really close.  Do you feel like that win will help you this week?

It's no problem pressure.  Yeah.   
 Q.  How is your back?  
HA NA JANG: No problem.   
 Q.  No problem?  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Good.  How do you like this course?  
HA NA JANG: This course really hard because bunker and then really too far in the in the fairways and narrow the fairway, too.   
I think par-3 just par is fine, because this golf course like 20 birdie, like feels good and 20 birdie, so just one thing is no bogeys no more par and the birdie.

HA NA JANG: What is that mean?
