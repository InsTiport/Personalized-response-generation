Q.   Another solid day out there today.   What was the key to your round?
HA NA JANG:   I think today is just a little miss the fairway.   I think yesterday 100% my fairway, but today is maybe ten fairway.   So I think it's bit trouble with my tee shot today.   I think it's better than yesterday, yeah, so. 

Q.   When you have little bit of trouble like that but you're still able to post a good score, that has to give you a lot of confidence going into the weekend?
HA NA JANG:   I think better than definitely than the two weeks.   So I focus my irons and the tee shot, so just change my irons, new irons Wednesday.   I think a little bit more confidence and it's really good.   Yeah.

Q.   Is it easy for you to get new clubs on Wednesday and just put them into play the next day?
HA NA JANG:   No problem.

Q.   You played with Sei Ri the past two days.   We've talked before that you're a Sei Ri kid.   You want there to be Ha Na kids.   What does it mean to play with her at an LPGA event? 
HA NA JANG:   I'm first round play Sei Ri Park last years in Hawaii.   Second player two days, two weeks, and then really nice player.   Very nice, normal girl.   I think it's very too much players normal (indiscernible) Sei Ri Park and Inbee Park. 
I think it's very focus and like very good player in LPGA. 
(Through translation.)   It's a really big deal for someone to put their name in the Hall of Fame, and I look, up to her in that aspect.

Q.   Any advice she has given you before coming over here? 
HA NA JANG:   (Through translation.)   She told me to enjoy my time while playing on the LPGA and how to ease into the LPGA.
