HA NA JANG: Really surprise my play because weather so bad on the back nine.  But just be patient every hole.  Just simple my thinking.  Just thinking hitting the flag and the hitting the fairway and really good score.
That's why simple in the score, too.
Q. Wow, a simple 62.  I bet you want to keep that scorecard and sleep with it tonight.
HA NA JANG: Uh-huh.  I want keep this, my scorecard.  Always I want inside my pocket.  I hope so.
Q. You are leading by 6 going into tomorrow.  You've got to be so full of confidence.  Is it going to change how you will play tomorrow?
HA NA JANG: I think not really change my mind because just playing golf is really good.  Because this golf course really tough, just to be patient, be patient, and after round I think it's really great round.
Q. And after the round, should you win tomorrow, can we expect a celebration?
HA NA JANG: I don't want to tell nobody.  Just top secret.  I think not much like dance or something, just little quiet celebration.
