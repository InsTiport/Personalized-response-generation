 Q.  Seems like you've been very comfortable all week so far.  
HA NA JANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What's been working for you this week?  
HA NA JANG: I mean, this week is more like just be patient is very important, because weather is so bad and the golf condition so bad, too.   
That's why I'm just hitting fairway, the green.  Very important this week, yep, this weather, this score.   
 Q.  Keeping it simple like that, fairways and greens, does that ease your mind?  That's all you have to think about?  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, I mean, like the two-putt, after I'm just think about, just say, Trust yourself.  You great player.  Just be patient.  Middle of the green is fine.  Two-putt is pretty good.  Par score is pretty good.   
 Q.  You had a great start to the year.  
HA NA JANG: Yes.   
 Q.  You feel like you're getting back to where you were at the beginning?  
HA NA JANG: Oh, yeah.  I mean, like three years ago I played before this golf course, same tournament and same like golf course, too, and weather is exactly same.   
Really good finish, Top 5 finish, that's very important and more comfortable and more concentration, too.   
 Q.  So you're able to draw off the previous experience and say, Been here before; this is nothing new?  
HA NA JANG: Yeah, uh-huh.  Nothing new.
