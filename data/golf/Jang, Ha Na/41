Q.   What was the key to your great play out there today? 
HA NA JANG:   I think that everything is better but I think today is very nice second shot and then everything, irons, better today.   And then‑‑ maybe birdie chance and make the putt.   Really nice day.

Q.   What did you do to pass your time before your tee time, because you had a lot of time to wait. 
HA NA JANG:   I just wake up and just a little break time, just for a little practice, just different drive‑‑ in morning, just relax and then practice starting at one o'clock.   What is that, two hours, 30 minutes of practice today.   And then one thinking, just focus, focus, focus, yeah. 

Q.   And then last one, what's going to be the keys for the rest of your weekend of golf? 
HA NA JANG:   I think this week, golf is very difficult around this course.   The one thing, just fairway and the greens.   The greens are really fast and really soft end.   Just don't focus, just like‑‑ every second shot, focus.
