Q. How are you feeling heading into the final round, tied for the lead with Lydia?
HA NA JANG: Yeah, like really fun right now because I'm the leader right now, so really comfortable today and really confident right now.  Better than yesterday, the conditions are really tired yesterday, but today it's really good conditions.  I think it's no problem, more 18 holes.  Feel really good right now.
Q. Are you guys kind of feeding off each other, matching each other with the birdies out there?
HA NA JANG: Yeah, sometimes I really same the birdie, and then Lydia, first hole, and then my second hole.  So really good right now, yeah.
Q. What did you learn in last year's final round here that you can take to today?
HA NA JANG: Oh, same group, it's the same players.  But Lydia is really good friend, Lydia, so sometimes really fun talking too much.  I think it's no problem, so I don't want to think about another play, so I'll just keep up my play.
Q. Your irons are really good.  What is your confidence level?
HA NA JANG: Just a little change in my swing.  It's difficult, last year and this year.  Last year is too much follow with my swing, but this year is a little more compact swing, a little different, so it's a little more confident and too much practice and winter training, so it's no problem.
Q. You've been talking to the Japanese player.  What were you talking about?
HA NA JANG: I'm just a little speak Japanese, so just talking, so I always say hi or how did you do or what's your tee times or some things.
