Q. Tell me about last week.  You feel refreshed?
HA NA JANG: Before my schedule, I go back to Korea a little switch my schedule, because my doctor, she has a little vacation week.  So I was in Canada, and just a couple weeks at my friend's home in there.  It's really fun, and just two, three days in Korea, and then go back maybe from Korea to Canada until Wednesday and just practice round in Toronto at the golf course.  Then come from Canada for here till Sunday is really good.
Q. So home to Korea for a couple days, Canada, Niagara Falls.
HA NA JANG: Just two days.
Q. So today, how did you feel coming into this week?  Did you know the course at all?
HA NA JANG: It feels like course is exactly the same, the color, but really big difference from last year.  Last year is a links course but this year is more close to the Korea golf course.  It's more comfortable, and my shot is much better.  Feels good, concentration, and the more shots myself, and it's a really good score, just be patient in the fairway and the greens, good score, too.
Q. When I talked to you last, you said everything about confidence.  Are you feeling even more so?
HA NA JANG: I think it's more confidence.
Q. For a major, how do you prepare differently at all, or is it just same tournament?
HA NA JANG: Just I'm always like exactly the same.  I will try like same thinking every tournament.  But I think it's more important, I think it's ten percent more important in majors more.
Q. What worked today best?  You said no bogeys.
HA NA JANG: Every hole before the shot, I'm just talking to caddie, I'm just more hitting clubs 8-irons, just middle of the green, just fairway, middle of the green, 2-putt, really good.
