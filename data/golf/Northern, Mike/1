  Q. It seems like today maybe a bit better than yesterday was for you.   
 MIKE NORTHERN: Yeah, that was kind of my goal. I just wanted to go out and hit it a little bit better. I wasn't too happy the way I hit it yesterday, so I didn't get off to a very good start, but then actually played pretty good after about five holes. It was enjoyable.  
  
  Q. Overall how would you rate the experience?   
 MIKE NORTHERN: Awesome.   
  
  Q. What are you going to be able to take back home with you? What experience do you think stands out the most?  
 MIKE NORTHERN: You know, it's just enjoyable to come out here and play and compete with the best in the world. You know, go back and kind of watch some of these guys. A couple days watching Gary hit it was phenomenal. The guy can move it out there.
