 Q. Can you just talk about what it means to come out and play in this event?
 MIKE NORTHERN: As a club pro, it's great, to be able to intermix with all the Tour players. Obviously had a great day playing with Gary Woodland. Played just phenomenal. It's awesome to be able to do this.

 Q. Can you talk about your round and did it live up to expectations?
 MIKE NORTHERN: I was a little frustrated. I didn't hit it very good today. Going to probably hit a few balls on the range and see if I can get a few things worked out.
