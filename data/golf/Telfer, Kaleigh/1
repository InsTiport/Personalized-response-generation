  Q. Just talk about that moment on 11, how good that was?
 KALEIGH TELFER:   Definitely in the practice round yesterday, I said to my brother, he was caddying for me that this is probably one of the toughest greens on the course and we just have to hit it on the right level and I ended up doing that and it was a pretty straight right-edge putt and I just made the putt.
 Q. Talk about your experience overall?
 KALEIGH TELFER:   I mean, it's just been a fun week overall and I've had a lot of fun out here.  I didn't have my best game today but it was just fun to be out there with my brother on the bag.  So yeah, it was a special moment.
 Q. What did it mean for your brother to be on the bag?
 KALEIGH TELFER:   Yeah, he was definitely happy to be out there.  He tried to kick himself off the bag after the practice round but I think he loved walking up 18 with me.  And yeah, it was fun.
 Q. The decision to stick with your brother and not a local caddie, was that a no-brainer for you?
 KALEIGH TELFER:   Yeah, I said to myself if I wasn't anywhere close to contention coming into this round that I'd definitely have them on the bag and just enjoy every moment of it.
