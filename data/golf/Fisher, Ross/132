  Q. Can you reflect on the week and look ahead to next week?  
 ROSS FISHER: Pretty disappointing really. Same old story for me, I hit the ball pretty well but just couldn't hole a putt. These greens are very tricky to be fair but it was just a bit frustrating. Considering I have had a few weeks off with the baby and all that, I am actually hitting the ball quite well so I will try and take those positives into next week. I think I have found a little something on the range with my driving which is good and which I will take forward. When I get there, though, I think I will probably spend three solid days working on my putting because that will need to improve. But, if I can start holing some putts I feel like I can really seriously contend next week in the PGA.  
  
  Q. How are Jo and baby Eve?  
 ROSS FISHER: They are both very well I'm pleased to say. I got a nice little picture from Jo of the two of them this morning which was a great way to start my day. I'm looking forward to seeing them after the PGA is done and dusted.
