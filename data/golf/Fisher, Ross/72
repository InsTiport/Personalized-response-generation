  ROSS FISHER:   It was a strange day.   Hit a beautiful tee shot off the first, and just kind of walked off the tee and went to putt my left foot down and went down and it just rolled over on to the ankle, so it was kind of‑‑ pain sort of comes through and it was a bit sore and I thought, I've twisted ankles before and it's not really bothered me as such. 
Kind of the first five or six holes‑‑ managed to see a rules official and asked to call a physio out, so he came out on the seventh, told him what I had done.   He had a look at it, kind of was pressing on some points in the ankle and it was pretty sore.   I'm not going to tell you what I told him when he was touching my foot.   It was pretty sore.   I was fortunate when he said I haven't broken anything or torn anything I don't think.
.he just strapped it up.   Felt a little bit uncomfy for a couple holes, but once the painkillers started to kick in, I could move in it reasonably well and walk.   I just have to make sure I walked on flat ground because obviously around here, there's a lot of slope so I have to be very careful and didn't want to do it again.
Hitting full shots was quite tough, but, you know, tried to grind it out, stick through it and you know, to come out with 4‑under, I'm obviously delighted.

Q.   And on top of the leaderboard, was there any doubt about even continuing? 
ROSS FISHER:   There was.   Adam said, you know, it's not worth doing yourself permanent injury.   You've got some big tournaments coming up.   Not saying this isn't a big tournament because it is, and I really want to be playing golf‑‑ so, yeah, it did cross my mind.   Especially the fifth when I hit a good drive and laid up and had a 40‑yard pitch and could really, really feel it even on a practise swing. 
Did cross my mind but I said, if we can call Jesper and get him out, see what he thinks and if he tells me it doesn't look good and you should stop, I would have stopped.   But he reassured me; and a strap in and some good golf shots later, and there I am at the top of the leaderboard.

Q.   Wasn't on your mind at all when the eagle sunk at 17? 
ROSS FISHER:   It was quite painful to walk around or even crouch down to have a look.   I was kind of doing it quite gingerly and trying not to put too much pressure on it.   That one was probably going a little far past, maybe three or four feet, but hit a great putt and luckily for me caught the edge of the hole.   And then two good shots on 18. 

Q.   It was your toe in Wales, wasn't it? 
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, kind of Tuesday woke up with my chest feeling a little sore.   So I played the Pro‑Am on Wednesday, it was almost like my ribs and my pec was really stiff and sore and tight.   Thursday morning, woke up, I had physio and it felt really, really sore.   Fortunately out on the golf course, didn't feel it once, it was really, really good.   Whereas the Pro‑Am really hurt me to bend over and pick the ball up. 
So it's been a bit of an accidental‑prone week so far.   Thomas said make sure you don't go and do your right foot tonight or tomorrow.   Hopefully I'll put the feet up, go and see Jesper and the boys, ice it, have a nice chilled evening with the family and fingers crossed it won't be sore and I'll be raring to go if it's a hundred percent or even if it's 80 percent, go out there and give it my best and we still have two more days to go. 

Q.   It is to do with that old clichÃ©, that argument that it focuses the mind?
ROSS FISHER:   Tried not to think about it because obviously the more you think about it, probably the worse it's going to feel.   So it was difficult at times but just very thankful for the physio and Jesper coming up and reassuring me it's fine and strapping me up and getting me through 18 holes.
