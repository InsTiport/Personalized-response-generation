Q.   Talk about being here at Celtic Manor on a week when Ryder Cup points start. 
ROSS FISHER:   Obviously very exciting stuff, 12 months until next year's Ryder Cup.   Nice to be back in Wales and sunny Wales this time, so hopefully we'll be get four good days of nice Welsh sun. 
But always nice to be back to a place that has fond memories, obviously Ryder Cup in 2010 and coming close here last year, so delighted to be back in the U.K. and looking forward to a good week.

Q.   I take it whenever you see the scene of that wonderful green and know there's that bank with the spectators, the memories come flooding back?
ROSS FISHER:   They do.   You only have to arrive at the clubhouse and go into the locker room and you're straightaway brought back to 2010 with all the results of all the games on some of the lockers.   And obviously for me being fortunately part of the team, I have the same locker which I had in The Ryder Cup for the last couple of years, so same locker this year.
It definitely brings back a nice feel when I come back to Celtic Manor for sure.

Q.   Despite the memories being fresh, are able to feed off the memories of them, because that was a different Ross Fisher we saw that week. 
ROSS FISHER:   Was it? 

Q.   An energised, really vibrant ‑‑
             ROSS FISHER:   I think having played a few World Cups with Poults and being paired with him first out on Friday, seeing how he gets energised for The Ryder Cup, sitting down with him, chatting to him, he just said, it brings something out of him from inside. 
It's just a very different week.   You're not playing for yourself like you are week‑in, week‑out, as a Tour pro.   You're playing for your captain, your vice captain, your team, The European Tour, the whole of Europe. 
So it adds that little bit extra spice to it.   I don't know, just for some reason, it brought out something from inside me which I didn't know I had.   Obviously it was a good thing, because I played very well. 
Having two great partners in Poults and PÃ¡draig; unfortunately me and Poults didn't get off to a great start losing to Tiger and Steve Stricker, but I managed to shake that off and put in two really strong performances with PÃ¡draig and get two wins, which is great.

Q.   Can you draw on that kind of energy?   Can you summon that up again when you need it in a regular stroke‑play tournament?
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, I think so.   I don't think you'll see the fist‑pumps and getting the crowds going as much, because it's a different scenario.   Like I say, I'm playing for just myself but there's definitely a hunger in there. 
Like you said, it's the first week of The Ryder Cup points, and I would dearly like to make Captain McGinley's team, having played under two, if not three, Seve Trophys of his and being on winning teams all the times I've played, so I know what he is capable of as a captain.   I think he'll be a great captain for Europe, and he's one that I'll relish the chance of playing under in a year's time. 

Q.   Today is clearly all about being positive, but you don't mind casting a net back to last year, there was a big negative for you.   What was your viewpoint on slow play now and have you managed to put it aside and change your game accordingly?
ROSS FISHER:   I think the best way to get past that was come out the following week all guns blazing, and obviously the week after this, I finished second in Sweden, so I kind of shook it off very quickly. 
But yeah, it was bitterly disappointing.   I had a very good chance to win with four or five holes ago, and then to get   told that I had been done for slow play, was really upsetting, because I don't feel like I'm a slow player. 
Yes, I probably did take a little bit longer than I needed to on the 11th, but, hey, the conditions weren't great, we weren't holding anyone up.   So, you know, to have a little bit of leeway would have been nice and understandable.   But unfortunately, that was the circumstance that came about, and I got penalised and that cost me the tournament. 
I'm all for slow play if they continue to do it, but since I got done last year, I think there's only been one other incident at the Masters with a 14‑year‑old.   I still stand by, I don't think I'm a slow player; I feel I'm one of the quicker ones out here.   I think there's a lot slower players than me out here. 
So if you are going to penalise people for slow play, you need to do it on a regular basis and the rules officials need to be out here more consistently.   Because I felt like after I got done, I was not kind of watching out, but I was looking to see if anyone was going to get penalised after‑‑ following what happened to me.   But that hasn't seemed to have been that case, so it will be interesting to see how it goes forward. 

Q.   Finally, does it make you more determined to do well at this Wales Open?
ROSS FISHER:   Absolutely, yeah.   We don't get to play much in the U.K. anymore.   We've got The Scottish Open, The Irish Open and the Welsh Open, no English Open. 
So any time you can be back in the U.K. playing in front of, I say home crowds, obviously Wales this week is not home for me but it's only a couple of hours away for me; yeah, definitely determined to putt in a strong performance this week. 
Like I say, I really like the golf course, have really fond memories, and last year, like you say, after what happened, it would be nice to get my own back on it a little bit.   So yeah, I will be out there trying to put in another strong performance this week, and hopefully we'll stand and chat Sunday afternoon, maybe in that position.

Q.   The field of dreams for everyone involved in The Ryder Cup, what is it like when you come back here? 
ROSS FISHER:   It's very special for sure.   It brings back a lot of memories immediately as you come over the top of the hill and you look down and you see the clubhouse.   The special part is getting into the locker room and seeing all the games printed up on all the lockers and obviously being part of the team, having my locker for that week, and having it for the last couple years and the same this year; it's very special. 
I've funnily enough just had treatment off my physio saying it's great to see the list of the matches and the scores and it's fantastic to think that that will be there for many more years to come.   So every time this tournament will be here and I'll come back, it will definitely bring back memories of that special week in 2010. 

Q.   Slightly different time of year playing here this year, the course is in a different condition, really, than we've seen it before; what do you make of it?   There's a bit more of rough out there and more of a challenge this year.   What do you think of it?
ROSS FISHER:   I haven't been out here, and I'll be out there late morning in the Pro‑Am.   I've heard the course is in great shape.   Normally we are playing the week after Wentworth, so late May, a few months later. 
So hitting some balls on the range and doing some chipping and putting, it does seem a bit firmer.   It doesn't seem as wet as it can be here, especially Ryder Cup, one of those.   But yeah, I think the forecast is good for this week.   It's about time we had some decent weather in the U.K. 
But yeah, I think just looking down the 18th there, the course is very green.   I think it will be dry.   Spoke to a couple of players, and they said the rough wasn't too bad.   In previous years, if you miss fairways, it can be very tricky out here, but hopefully them set the course up pretty fair and we should see some good scores if the weather holds up.

Q.   Not just The Ryder Cup, but is this a course that really does suit your game and makes you feel comfortable and most at home, if you like?
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, I think so.   Like I say, in previous years, the rough has been quite penal, so the premium has been driving it long and straight, which is one of my strengths. 
Yeah, I don't know, I just feel comfortable on the course, ever since I've been here and obviously, like you say, looking back on fond memories of 2010, holing all those putts with PÃ¡draig, and coming close last year, it would be nice to get my own back sort of thing, because I've had a couple of chances around here. 
I feel like the course suits my game and I feel comfortable on the course.   I like the way the greens putt.   And for me, obviously being away from Europe so much this year, it's nice to be back in Europe and playing some good golf.

Q.   And after what happened to you last year, is there kind of a sense of unfinished business with this place?
ROSS FISHER:   Possibly, yeah.   It was frustrating; it was disappointing; annoying.   But that's golf.   Unfortunately I had to take it on the chin and I did, and I still gave myself chances coming in and got over it pretty quickly finishing runner‑up the following week. 
So, yeah, there is, I suppose kind of a little bit unfinished business, and one that I would definitely like to get my own back, that's for sure, because it's a tournament that I've played in many times and it's one that I would love to win, because as I said to the guys before, we don't play many tournaments in the U.K. anymore.   It would be nice to get a victory. 

Q.   In terms of bad time penalties, there's been a few high‑profile ones we've seen over the course of the year; is it something that's implemented enough on Tour, regularly enough on Tour, do you think? 
ROSS FISHER:   Oh, that's a tough one.   I mean, when I got done for the slow play, I was kind of hoping that they would clamp down a little bit more, and from what I can remember, I can remember seeing the young Chinese lad in Augusta this year getting penalised and perhaps one of the Japanese guys in The Open this year, and apart from that, there's not been many.   To be one of the first to get penalised in umpteen years I think, I forget who the first guys were, obviously very disappointing from my point of view. 
You know, I'm all for slow play, and if you're going to penalise me, you need the rules guys to drive around more regularly, check players, make sure they are not taking too long, because at the moment, golf rounds are taking far too long.   You know, over five hours for a three‑ball, three professional golfers, is way too long to take. 
So it will be interesting to see how long the rounds take this week, obviously with decent weather and what the officials do with slow play and keeping on top of people.   You know, hopefully they won't be keeping too close of an eye on myself. 

Q.   With the start of the qualification team for Gleneagles this week, how much is that in mind and how determined are you to get yourself involved in Paul McGinley's team; and also when you're here in European Tour events, showcase to him, remind him, if you like, of what you can do? 
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, absolutely.   I was disappointed to miss the last one, having played in the one in Wales a few years back.   I think a few people said once you play in one, you don't want to miss any.   Obviously I was disappointed to miss the last one. 
So, yeah, I'm really excited about the prospects of getting in Paul's team.   I would love to be a part of it, having been part of his winning Seve Trophy teams, on two, if not three oaks.   I know what he's like as a captain and I think he'll be a fantastic captain for Europe in Gleneagles in a year's time, and he's very well respected amongst his peers.   He's had a great career.   He's had a very good Ryder Cup career obviously, holing that winning putt at The Belfry. 
Yeah, this week, obviously you want to win the tournament, because the Welsh Open and being in the U.K.   But yeah, it's got a little bit of added excitement because it's the first week of The Ryder Cup points.   I mean, it's the first week of a long year before it starts, but it would be nice to get off to a hot start, and like you say, remind Paul of my capabilities and definitely want to try my best to make the team.
