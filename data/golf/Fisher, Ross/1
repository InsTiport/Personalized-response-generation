Q. 68. How would you rate that round?
ROSS FISHER: I'd say probably gutsy, I guess. Wasn't anywhere near as good as yesterday. It's been a while since being in the mix like that last week on a weekend. So you know, was really excited for the day ahead.
Yeah, I played some good stuff. A couple of sloppy shots here and there. Felt like I kept the ball in play pretty well. Maybe a couple of shots didn't quite go according to plan, but nice to roll that putt in on the last there. That would have been a little bit disappointing to come off the back of hitting two lovely shots into 17 to follow up with a bogey, especially on a par 5.
Nice to roll that in and sign for 68 and look ahead to what could be a great day tomorrow.
Q. Going for that par on 18, how much could that help your momentum going into tomorrow?
ROSS FISHER: Yeah, we always talk about this thing called momentum. Yeah, I mean, I'd imagine if I had missed that, I probably wouldn't be speaking to you today.
It was nice. Fortunately, it stayed just inside where Matthias was, so I got a pretty good read at the line and speed. His just managed to dive in, but I wanted to give mine a little bit more pace and saw it go inside left. Was relieved after hitting what I thought was a great tee shot, if it probably stays or turns over a couple more yards or goes a little bit lower, it misses the tree and gets a bit forward and I'm going into the green with probably a mid-iron but it just clipped the tree, which took a lot of it.
But fancied the second shot. Was sitting up nicely. Just unfortunately wasn't a great shot and then on the right, you're guessing with an iron. Lucky that I bailed out to the right and left myself an easy-ish up-and-down. Left myself with a little bit of work to do. Hopefully get a bit of food, a bit of rest, and all to play for tomorrow.
