 Q. Justin Leonard was a formidable player - how does it feel to get it done?
 ROSS FISHER: I'm very relieved. I felt I played really, really good for 12 holes. Then hit a slight mishit on 13 and lost that one and then whiffed it on 14. I thought come on knuckle down and to win 14 was huge. Then to knock it non 15 and two putt was massive. Then all of a sudden I blocked it right on 16. I was thinking trust the swing as I was hitting it great and unfortunately didn't. 17 was another mystery but I hit a great shot in. To see Justin miss his birdie was surprising but I thought come on and knock it in and fortunately I did.

 Q. Thoughts on Paul Casey this afternoon?
 ROSS FISHER: Every match has been tough this week and they are getting tougher and tougher as the guys remaining in are playing good golf. Casey is one of those guys, he is playing very well and I am sure it will be a tough match. I know Paul well and sure there will be a bit of banter and chit chat but once it comes down to being serious he will want to beat me and I will want to beat him.
