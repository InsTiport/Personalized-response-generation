 Q. Level par through your front nine, which is the back nine where most people are doing the scoring. And then two on 2-under on the back, 33; what was the secret to that back nine?
 ROSS FISHER: Just being patient I think. You know, I got off to a reasonably steady start, hit a couple of nice shots into 10 and 11, dropped one on 12 and then hit a lovely 3-iron into 13 to about eight feet and made eagle there.
 Was kind of hanging on, and then hit what I thought was a good tee shot on the last, just run through the fairway into the sand pit, had to take the drop. And making 6, you're find of feeling a lit bit disappointed, but I knew I had nine holes to go, and picked up a couple of birdies and very, very nice to finish with a birdie on 9.

 Q. What's the most difficult aspect out there today in these conditions? 
 ROSS FISHER: I think there's a lot. Obviously it's very difficult for player and caddie to pick the right club. You know, picking the wind is very, very difficult. Usually rely on, there's a couple of flags around on some of the buildings, which makes it a little bit easier, and I think we looked at one on the third tee and actually had blown off. So it was very, very tricky. 
 But you know, we just had to trust the wind was there, and at times, it got very, very strong, and obviously with the sand blowing around, it was very, very difficult to see. So another key factor is staying patient. It's difficult out there. You know you're going to miss fairways and you know you're going to miss greens, and every time I missed a fairway, I tried to take my medicine and rely on my short game getting up-and-down. Very, very happy.
