 Q. Congratulations on winning your first match in a World Match Play. Any particular aspect of your game confident responsible for that win do you feel? 
 ROSS FISHER: I think just consistency really for 14 holes. It's just trying to keep in play. You know, I was very fortunate, I hit a few loose shots today. You know, a few times I got away with it and managed to scrape some unbelievable halves. I knew I just needed to keep hanging in there, plugging away and keep the ball in play and try to make as many birdies as I can. Came unstuck a little bit with the last couple to go but managed to hang on and scrape a victory. He.

 Q. How special is it to be part of this?
 ROSS FISHER: It's huge. Obviously disappointed that I don't get to play match play at Wentworth but they go going through some changes and it's moved here to Finca Cortesin and what a great venue. It's an interesting course. 
 You know, I've never had to sit on a buggy so many times and get so many rides on buggies, but the course is in tremendous shape and the greens are absolutely superb for a course that's only been open, for, what, a couple of years. It's just a great site and it's a great match-play course and it's a very good test for us golfers.
