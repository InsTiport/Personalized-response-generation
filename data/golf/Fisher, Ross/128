 Q. Sum up your third round of the PGA Championship?
 ROSS FISHER: A little bit of a frustrating day. Didn't hit the ball as well as the first two days but still hit it pretty solid. Didn't really hit too many poor shots. Apart from trunking my sand wedge on the left. But it was a tough day. Probably didn't quite putt as well as I did yesterday. But it was tough out there. 
 It wasn't as hard as the last couple of days. So it was tricky to get your distances and the wind was swirling around a lot. It was obviously difficult playing with -- Paddy was playing so well and he was getting on a run and I just tried to stay with him, because I knew he was getting right out there. So I hung in there as best I could and got it back to level for the day. But unfortunately bogeyed the last. But after all I'm still there. I'm probably a few more shots back than I'd like to be but still a long way to go.

 Q. Did that affect your game to see him make a few more birdies?
 ROSS FISHER: Not really. Kind of tried to inspire myself because you see a guy that's playing so well, making birdies. Not dropping shots. Holing some good putts. And when you're not holing them you're thinking more what do I have to do sort of thing so I tried to stay patient, stay with it and made a couple of really good birdies coming in. Would have been nice to have sunk one on the last or parred it, but it's disappointing to finish with a bogey. 
 But at the same time it was still reasonably solid today.
