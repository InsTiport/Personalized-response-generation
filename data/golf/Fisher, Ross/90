 Q. A round of 1-under par. How do you feel about that?
 ROSS FISHER: Quietly pleased, but at the same time a little disappointed. Again, I played a little better than that but probably didn't play quite as well as yesterday. Didn't hole as many putts, but I gave myself a lot of chances, and unfortunately couldn't capitalize. Was going along fine and I was just off the green on 13 with a reasonably simple chip and just skulled it through into the hazard and made 6 and tried to battle back from there. Fortunately it was nice to birdie 18. 

 Q. Talk about how different this golf course is to the tournaments you play on the European Tour. Explain to us why it is so much more difficult. 
 ROSS FISHER: It's just on another level. You know, for one, it's the Masters. It's a major championship. You know, they cut the fairways into you, so it's very important to get good connection on the ball, and that's not even talking about the greens. You know, they're very slopey, very severe, and if you get above some of these holes, they are extremely quick. I mean, they're probably rolling at I would guess 12 or 13. Some putts are rolling nearer to 17, 18. They are just like putting down a staircase, it's that quick. You've got to hit the ball in the right spots, and for two days I've done pretty well, so hopefully I can have two more good days.
