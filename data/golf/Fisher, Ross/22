 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ROSS FISHER: Yeah, a little bit.  Just didn't play well today, that simple.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ROSS FISHER: Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Today was just one day too far, unfortunately.  I just never got down from the start.  A poor tee shot off the first.  I felt I played better, but couldn't get any momentum going.  After I made a birdie things could have kicked on, and then three bogeys after the turn, put the pace on that, really.  Disappointed.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ROSS FISHER: I'm going to enjoy a week off and even then go play Akron and PGA.  It's been a fantastic week, getting up there in contention towards the end of Saturday, and then getting in the last groups on Sunday is what you dream about.  But today wasn't meant to be.  So we live to fight another day.
