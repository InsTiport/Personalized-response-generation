  Q.  Some comments on the day; still in there, still fighting.   
 ROSS FISHER:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  How did you think it went today?   
 ROSS FISHER:  I think I'm pretty pleased.  Always it was going to be a bit nerve-wracking and probably one of the biggest days of my golfing career so far, just got to look around at the crowd.  You know, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't shaking, a bit nervous.  But I've got to try and control myself, keep myself in check and still hit the ball.   
 But no, I feel like I played okay.  Still felt, you know, pretty calm as the round progressed.  Took me a couple of holes to also really sort of feel calm within myself.   
 But yeah, just didn't quite hit it as good as I have the last two days, but you know, I didn't know if that could be -- obviously I can still be pleased with how I've ended up.  Obviously shooting 1-under today in the company that I was in was pretty good.  Obviously a shame not to birdie the 18th, but fortunately I didn't kill anyone.   
 Obviously still 18 holes to play for.  Obviously Ernie played, you know, had a couple of up-and-downs but played a really solid back nine.  Obviously he's one of the best players in the world, so if I'm going to win the tournament, I've got to beat the best players in the world.  Just one more day to go and we'll see what happens.
