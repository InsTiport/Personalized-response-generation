Q. Ross, 20-under par is a fabulous total.  How do you rate those chances?
ROSS FISHER: I thought I needed to potentially get to 21, maybe 22.  You know, a little bit disappointed.  I gave myself a lot of chances coming in.  After holing that one on the par 3, 12, I gave myself a really good look on 13, just naturally shaved the edge there.
Good up-and-down on 14.  I thought, right, I need to make at least one, if not two, coming home.  Gave myself chances.  Just unfortunately didn't go in and then hit two lovely shots on 18.  Hit a good putt and just slipped by.
I'll definitely take it, but I have a feeling I might come up maybe one or two short.
Q. Watching you and Marcus trading birdies all the way around, what was that like to be a part of?
ROSS FISHER: It was great.  Got off to a good start.  Fras got off to a good start.  We just kind of fed off each other, really, and the caddies were joking about, it, "You hole one; I'll hole one."    It was just a lot of fun.
A shame a couple of cameras went off on Marcus's backswing and stuff which cost him a bogey or two.  All in all we both knew we needed to go low, and did our best and obviously got it to 20-under, which is a great finish to what's been a really fun and enjoyable week.
Q. What will you do now?
ROSS FISHER: You know what, I've got no idea.  Probably switch my phone on, call Jo and speak to the kids, see how they are doing.
Yeah, I guess fingers crossed.  You don't really wish any ill, bad play or bad golf on anyone.  Like I say, lots of quality players behind me with lots of holes to play.
All I can do is sit and wait.  If it's good enough, then great.  If not, then I've done my best.  That's all I can ask for.
