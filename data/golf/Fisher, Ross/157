 Q. Assessment of today's round?
 ROSS FISHER: Yeah, a little bit disappointing but that's golf. Cruising after nine holes really, playing pretty good, hit two good shots into the second and got a wicked hard bounce and 3-putted that for par. A bit of a shame, and then just hit the wrong shot on three and made bogey. Hit the wrong shot on five, made bogey. Wrong shot on six, made bogey. Wrong shot on 7. 
 So all of a sudden, you know, to go from cruising to back to two, back to one, back to level, it was a bit disappointing. Level is obviously very disappointing but 5-under was leading after day one. You know, it was out there this morning, the greens were better, but they still weren't great. 
 To get it to 3-under, I was thinking, if I could keep it three, maybe sneak a couple, four or five would be nice. I see Colin took advantage, could have been pretty more, but I'm here for the weekend. 
 You just have to try and hole putts, and it's very difficult to hole them. It takes a lot out of your patience and your mental state to believe that you can hole putts. Especially yesterday afternoon. I mean, the greens were just so hard to hole putts. 
 Lee, I saw him yesterday, 16, that was off the green and then he holed the monster on 17, but yesterday all of a sudden he 4-putted, and it's that sort of course. You can hole bombs, you can hole putts but you can quite easily 3- or 4-putt from not very far because they are not very pure surfaces and you can doubt yourself, because it can bobble and you have to suck it up and just hit it and whatever happens, happens.
