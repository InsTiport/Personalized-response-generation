 Q. You've played with some magnificent partners in Ryder Cup, how impressed are you with Ross? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: He played some fantastic golf. Quality-wise, he certainly played the best golf anybody has probably ever seen in a Ryder Cup, he made all the shots, holed all the putts. He really did play awesome.

 Q. How valuable was PÃ¡draig's experience? 
 ROSS FISHER: It was huge. I just had so much fun out there. Being with Paddy again, you know, you're with a great champion, three-time Major Champion and he showed his class. I got him to read my putts, and every time I was standing over a putt, I felt so confident knowing that he's reading my putts, and as you saw there, just hit it on the line he gave me. 

 Q. Describe the atmosphere out here from a player's point of view? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's okay now; we're finished. It was awesome obviously out on the golf course. The support was unbelievable. It kept us going. Certainly in the middle of the round, I hit a couple of bad shots and I just thought to myself, every time I looked up, every time I smiled, I got a cheer, just made you feel like you were on top of the world.

 Q. They say once you play Ryder Cup, you never want to miss one. I assume that's true for you?
 ROSS FISHER: Absolutely. This is truly unbelievable. All you have to do is listen to those fans behind us. You never want to miss it. And, yeah, the fans are tremendous and hopefully we can see just as many, if not more, tomorrow.
