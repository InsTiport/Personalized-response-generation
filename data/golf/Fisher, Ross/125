   ROSS FISHER: It was a very disappointing day today and just didn't seem to quite happen for me. But I got some calculations slightly out and I had to hole some ridiculous putts to keep myself going - a 20 footer for par on the 18th for example. 

 I feel that I got away with it slightly at level par because it could easily have been five or six over today. That's why it's so disappointing because every time I turn up at a tournament these days my expectations are high and this week is no different.
