ROSS FISHER: That was the goal at the start of the week.  I still was turning up here, trying to win the golf tournament.  Trying to put the Masters to the back of my mind.  After Wednesday, it was looking a little bit too far away.  I hung in there, fought really, really hard.  To get to where I have this week, I'm obviously delighted.  Disappointed with this afternoon, but just one of those days.  Just didn't quite have it on the greens.   
6, 7, 8, 9 were pivotal holes there.  Could have gone 1 down at the turn and I was 4 down, so always struggling.  Then 5 down, five to go, hung in there, battled away.  Unfortunately got a horrendous bounce on 16.  You walk up there thinking you chip it on the middle of the green and then the rest is history, I suppose.   
Like you say, good consolation that I get to play in two weeks time.   
 Q.  Confidence is the most pressure commodity for a world class player for yourself.  How much do you have in your possession?  
ROSS FISHER: Loads.  Look forward to taking a week off next week.  I think I'll probably stay over in the States, rest over at Lake Nona and hopefully Jo and the kids will join me at the end of the week.  Try to get to Augusta on Saturday to secure one of those nice tee off times for Wednesday.  That would be a dream come true to have Harry and Eve caddie for me in the par-3.  I've played there obviously before when they were still too young, but now they are a great age of 7 and 5.  It will be a truly memorable week.
