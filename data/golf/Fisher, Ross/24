 Q.  Was that hard work out there today?  
ROSS FISHER: Yeah, it was.  Didn't feel like I played poorly but probably wasn't as solid as the first two days.  You know, for some reason, I've struggled a little bit with almost like a groin pain that's been pretty sore this week and been seeing my physio, Iain, worked on it, and had some real hot baths with salts to try to ease the pain.   
Yesterday was decent for about 12, 13 holes, and felt like my legs got really heavy and struggling towards the end.  Today felt like I was walking with almost a bit of a limp but got through it.  To finish level par, it was a decent score.   
 Q.  A bogey dropped early but nice to get two birdies back straightaway, and sort of more patient after that, I think, wasn't it?  
ROSS FISHER: Yeah, it was just tricky.  Obviously like you say, after all the rain we had, premium was hitting in the fairway.  But when I hit the fairway on I think 3 and 4, had two mud balls.  So you're kind of like, where is this going to go, sort of thing.   
Was a little bit surprised we didn't play preferred lies.  Obviously especially the height I hit the golf ball, I'm going to struggle.  Fortunately a few balls hit the fairway and went into the first cut, so most of the mud came off.   
But yeah, it was good fun obviously being out with Thomas.  He struggled on the front nine and had a great back nine to finish 7-under.  I was trying to keep pace with him and to finish 5-under, obviously, what, two, three fine, going into tomorrow, all to play for.
