 Q.   Tell me your thoughts on the way you've battled back into this.   Nice back nine.   
ROSS FISHER:   Thank you.   It was very trying conditions today.   I knew it was going to be tough when we set out.   I knew there was rain forecast, but to get it like we got was very difficult.   
And to see some of the early starters shoot those scores, kind of we were all taking a bit of a step back.   I was a couple over early on and when you see guys shooting 5‑, 6‑, 7‑under, you think, well, must be out there.   
So just kind of hung in there, battled away, and a nice string of birdies on the close‑‑ on the back nine really helped me salvage a good day.   
   
 Q.   I take it it's hard to be patient sometimes when you are getting cold and battered by the rain.   
ROSS FISHER:   Just a little bit.   Like I say, it reminded me of The Irish Open at Carton House a few years back.   But it was tough, it was brutal, but it was the same for everyone else out there.   So just had to work hard, myself and Mike, trying it keep everything dry and umbrella was up, and then it was down, then it was up, then it was down.   It was just a long, tough day.  
But to come out and shoot 1‑under after, like I say, being a couple over after 11, very, very pleased.  
   
 Q.   And while it is not the advance you would have hoped, you're still in a very nice position now?  
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, definitely, 8‑under is leading.   So two back.   Hopefully we'll have decent weather tomorrow and I can show the form that I did yesterday.   Didn't quite have it today early on.   But like I say, really pleased the way I hung in there, battled away and thanks to some good shots and nice birdies, I'm right in there in contention.
