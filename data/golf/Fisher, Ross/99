 Q. Good to have blue on the board when you finished? 
 ROSS FISHER: Yeah, I mean, it's brilliant. Seeing blue is what we wanted to see, and what the crowd wanted to see. We came out aggressive, and it's nice to go in at the end of today's play with a lot of blue on that board. 

 Q. You would have wanted to play on but you also start tomorrow with the blue on the board. 
 ROSS FISHER: Yeah, we got to 8 green and it was pretty dark. Paddy said to me, "Do you want to putt?." I said I'm happy to putt. I feel like I've got the greens and we want to get the crowd before we go in. Unfortunately, I missed and Paddy missed, which gave the other boys a chance, but they didn't take it.
 We are 1-up, in a good position, and the boys have gone ahead, Westy and Luke, they are up against a formidable partnership, and the boys are flying the flag for Europe. 
 Every time I hole a putt, I'm so pumped. Playing with Poults and playing with Paddy, you know, it's absolutely fantastic. We just want to get this crowd really, really behind us. They have been behind us for, you know, ever since we got here on Tuesday and got out there. The crowd have been huge, so we want to win it just as much for us and for Monty and for all the boys.
