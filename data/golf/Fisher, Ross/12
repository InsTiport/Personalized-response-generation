ROSS FISHER: The wind was swirling.  You had to be really pinpoint.  Very similar to yesterday.  You step onto a tee and it should be one direction, and you look around at different flags and they are blowing three different directions.  You have got to trust what it's supposed to be, which is not easy when you can feel it in your face.  On certain tee shots, you have got to trust that it's dead across.
I knew it was going to be tough.  Zach is a great player.  He's a very gritty competitor, having seen it firsthand at Ryder Cups.  So it was going to be a tough game.  We both played pretty solid.  It was a nip and tuck.  He got 2-up early and I got pack to 2-up.  He fought back and managed to close it out.
Q. Certainly sets up an interesting scenario for tomorrow.  Matt as one and a half points.  So you win and certainly things would be better for you?
ROSS FISHER: That would help.  I mean, I did it the hard way the last year, losing my first match and then winning the next two to get through Louis in a playoff.  At this point to lose yesterday felt like it was a match that neither of us were in control.  Just a couple of pivotal points didn't go my way.
So I knew I had to come out and play better today.  Fortunately I did that.  Like you said, tough game tomorrow against Kuch, but you have got to play the top 63, 64 players in the world out here.  You are not going to get an easy game.
