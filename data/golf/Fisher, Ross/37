 Q.  You must be pleased with that?  
ROSS FISHER: Iâm obviously very pleased with the way round, and itâs a good continuation of the form I showed in Germany a couple of weeks back. Kingsbarns is normally the easier of the three courses so you know you have to make a decent score here, but when the wind blows here itâs anything but easy, because some holes are very exposed to the elements. So Iâm delighted with seven under to start.   
 Q.  How tough was it in the wind?  
ROSS FISHER: Itâs a different wind to the one we experienced in practice, it completely flipped around so it was almost like playing a different course. So it took a few holes to get into the round and get used to the conditions, but the birdie on 16 got me off and running and I didnât look back after that.   
 Q.  What were the highlights?  
ROSS FISHER: The eagle on three was obviously the highlight, and to finish with another birdie on the ninth was the icing on the cake. But Iâm almost more pleased to have kept the bogeys off my card, because itâs not an easy course in those conditions.   
 Q.  Looking forward to playing St Andrews?  
ROSS FISHER: You never get tired of playing St Andrews, itâs the Home of Golf and itâs always a privilege to play there. It all depends on the weather at St Andrews, if the wind gets up then level par could be a decent score, but if it stays calm you can obviously take advantage. But whatever the weather, I always love playing the Old Course.   
 Q.  You enjoy this format?  
ROSS FISHER: The Pro-Am experience and atmosphere is great, I love it. Itâs a lot more laidback than weâre used to, and it makes for a lovely change. Obviously it means the rounds can take a lot longer, but we still had fun out there.   
 Q.  Take you a while to get over your play-off defeat?  
ROSS FISHER: I was obviously disappointed not to have finished it off in Germany, but if youâd offered me a play-off at the start of the final day, when I was five shots behind, I wouldâve taken it. I havenât won a play-off yet so Iâd like to get that monkey off my back, but if I keep putting myself in those positions, one day one will go my way.
