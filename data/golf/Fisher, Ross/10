Q. Ross, right where you left off last week.  Great play last week at Wentworth.  What's it like to get out there and shoot 65 first round?
ROSS FISHER: Very nice.  Yeah, felt like I played solid.  Went for a tough spell, hit some good putts that were just catching the edges and weren't going in.  Knew something had to change.  Holed a couple of putts, which was nice.  Disappointing to drop one but then to finish obviously birdie, birdie and then to close out with a holed second shot, sign for 65, delighted.
Q. How nice to finish with a 2?
ROSS FISHER: It was perfect.  110 yards to the pin.  Just a low, little sand wedge and it was literally straight down the pin from my line and to hear the crowd's reaction that it's gone in, great way to sign off.  Yeah, lunch will taste sweet.
Q. No wind, slower greens, soft fairways, big adjustment.  How do you adjust from last week?
ROSS FISHER: Yeah, very different.  Fairways are a lot wider.  Like you say, the ball is not rolling, at all.  So you can be fairly aggressive around the golf course.  Kind of like throwing darts.  Good thing is, with wedges, they are not spinning back, so that's one thing you don't have to worry about.  Greens are a lot slower but they still putted very, very nicely.  So I think we'll be in for some low scores for the rest of the week.
