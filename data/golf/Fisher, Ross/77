  ROSS FISHER:   Any time you can go in this place under par, you are pretty pleased.  
   
 Q.   It's the first major of the year, it's Ryder Cup year, looking at the leaderboard, you are seeing a bunch of European players up there, that's pretty cool.   
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, it is.   I didn't see my name on the leaderboard, but I knew I was doing all right.   But yeah, to see guys like Simpson and Kaymer up there, it's a big year for European golf, you know.   
I played in 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Like a few of the boys said, once you played one, you never want to miss another one.   I'm in the same boat.   I've got a lot of work to do.   I need a good kick up the backside and play some good golf.   
And there's a lot of guys vying to get on that team.   What a better way to start than here at the first major.  
   
 Q.   Absolutely.   What about the atmosphere from looking inside the ropes as a player?  
ROSS FISHER:   To me the Open Championship is very special because, you know, that's my major and being a Brit.   
But this is just paradise.   Even with the bad weather, you see the crowd out there.   I mean, the atmosphere is like something that you would never see, maybe a football stadium or for these guys up here American football.   Even Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday down on 16 you can hear the roars from all over the place.   It's just a special place and it's one that everyone wants to play in and you never want to miss coming here.  
   
 Q.   Thanks for stopping by and all the best for the rest of the week.
