Q.   Describe how you feel after that round?
ROSS FISHER:   Relieved.   Pleased.   A little disappointed, but yeah, overall, to come through 18 more holes is with the way the foot's been, very pleased.
Obviously disappointing to drop a shot on the last.   Would have been nice to go out there tied with Bernd.   Wasn't meant to be.   He played great.   6â€‘under today was a tremendous score.   You know, tried to keep my neck out in front and unfortunately didn't manage to do it.   But still one shot behind going into 18 more holes, there's still a lot of golf to play.

Q.   You must be delighted considering obviously the injury that you're managing to get around the golf course?
ROSS FISHER:   Yeah, it's challenging.   It was a lot easier today than it was yesterday, I must say.   Jesper and Shane and Miles did a great job on the foot.   Heavily bandaged overnight, and tried to take as much weight off it as I could yesterday.   And this morning, took it off, it's quite bruised but the swelling wasn't as bad as Jesper was thinking it would be. 
Strapped it up, went out there and played golf and a 69, I feel pretty pleased with that.
