   BABE LAUFENBERG: Good afternoon. Welcome to the opening ceremony for the 2010 HP Byron Nelson Championship and hopefully this weather continues. Please rise and join the Navy Color Guard from the Naval Air Joint Station Ft. Worth for the presentation of colors followed by our national anthem sung by recording artists, the Jennies, Amy Campbell and Andrea DeSpain. 
 (Applause.) 
 (Colors entered, followed by the singing of the National Anthem.)
 BABE LAUFENBERG: Please join me in thanking these and all the soldiers serving here and abroad. A big thank you, and a thank you to Andrea and Amy. They left us. That's not as good-looking of a spot as it was 5 minutes ago. (Laughter.) And wouldn't it be nice if Andy started things out today and Chad ended them on the 18th green? (Laughter.) 
 I am Babe Laufenberg of CBS 11 Sports. It's my privilege to be the emcee for the kick-off festivities here, and I was told a long time ago, the emcee at an event like this is like a corpse at an Irish wake; you're not supposed to say anything, but they need you to throw the party. That's my duty. 
 Tournament theme is: "A Great Time and a Greater Cause" and anyone wearing red pants is aware of what this tournament means to the game of golf, and it's fun for the spectators and everybody in Texas to watch great golf, enjoy an occasion beverage from time to time over in the pavilion, but it's about what this tournament stands for in terms of raising money. 
 Clearly, I did my part today. I didn't have a pair of red pants, but I did get the red tie out today and my wife looked at me and said, "What is that?" But in today's economic times what this tournament does for the kids and the families is more important than ever. I think we all understand that. Last year's Championship donated more than $4.2 million to the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers bringing the total raised by this tournament since 1968 to $112 million. 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: At this time I would like to introduce the chairman the of the 2010 HP Byron Nelson Championship, and I think originally I was subbing in for Randy Galloway, because when they figured out that Randy could not pronounce George Conant's name, they said well, we may have to get Babe! So Mr. George Conant. 
 GEORGE CONANT: Thanks, Babe. We truly appreciate the great job you do, CBS 11 and your colleagues at CBS network on broadcasting this tournament you do a great job. As Babe told you, this is for a "greater cause." Each dollar for the Championship goes to support the innovative and education experiences we have for the children and families in the Dallas area that are served through the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers here in Dallas. 
 We could not be successful, however, without the support of many groups. Please join me in thanking three special organizations today. First, I would like to thank the host city, the City of Irving, and the excellent Irving Convention and Visitor's Bureau for their support of our Championship. Please recognize the Mayor of Irving, the Honorable Mayor Herb Gears. 
 (Applause.) 
 GEORGE CONANT: Dr. Carlton Turner, the Chairman of the Irving Convention and Visitor's Bureau. 
 (Applause.) 
 GEORGE CONANT: The lady who does all the work, Ms. Maura Gast, executive director of the Irving Convention and Visitor's Bureau. 
 (Applause.) 
 GEORGE CONANT: Without the commitment of the Four Seasons, our tournament would not be special. Please thank help me in thanking and recognizing Michael Newcombe, the general manager of the Four Seasons and his team at Los Colinas. 
 (Applause.) 
 GEORGE CONANT: The game of golf is an international sport with many tournaments around the world. One of the key markers is a strong, global and amazing title sponsor. No tournament can top HP. On behalf of the children and families that this Championship serves, we're proud to be their partner. Please help me and thank HP and all the hundreds of volunteers there who will be joining us this week. 
 (Applause.) 
 GEORGE CONANT: It's now my pleasure to introduce Michael Mendenhall, HP's Senior V.P. and Chief Marketing Officer. 
 MICHAEL MENDENHALL: Thank you Babe, and on behalf of our 307,000 now employees around the world it's great to be here. Truly it's an honor, what a fantastic event it's great to be back. This is a first-class world-class event. I will tell you a great legacy to Lord Byron in the game of golf. But more than golf, this event has a broader purpose and it's about giving back to the community, which you've heard. 
 This has been a part of HP's legacy and foundation since its inception. There has been a wonderful book that has been written by Peggy, and it's entitled "Life with Lord Byron." I didn't know him personally, but I did have the chance to read the book and if you haven't, do so. You will get to know a great man, because in this book Peggy describes Lord Byron as graceful, respectful, a man with great dignity, to be the best that he could be, and that's something that I think another group of men that are here today actually have those same and similar characteristics. 
 That is a group who embody all of those things that I just mentioned. It is the Salesmanship Club of Dallas. I was going to ask them to stand but they're all standing. It is an honor for HP to be partnering with you, because you have changed so many lives in Dallas. We know that technology makes a difference in effective education, reducing drop-out rates and improving test scores. We only hope that HP's involvement in this event enables you men, and I want to say and your families -- last year I forgot to mention the families and the support group around these men who let them go do amazing things for the kids and families of Dallas, so I want to thank the families of the Salesmanship Club of Dallas and what you do to support these men. 
 (Applause.) 
 MICHAEL MENDENHALL: We hope HP's participation in this event will allow you to do even more amazing things through the use of technology and volunteerism from our HP employees. I want to thank you all for keeping Byron's spirit alive at this event. I want to thank the PGA for endorsing and supporting an event like this, and I'm going to leave you with a video that we produced on HP that defines a similar spirit about a company, and it's culture that I think is similar to the Salesmanship Club of Dallas. Let's all go do amazing things! Thank you very much. 
 (Applause.) 
 (Video playing) 
 (Applause.) 
 BROOKS CULLUM: Michael, thank you for those kind remarks and for the video. We say it all the time, but we have been truly blessed to have the best title sponsor on the PGA TOUR; you could say they're amazing. The HP family truly believes what we do is important in the work of the charities and what it does for the children and their families in Dallas County. Thursday nearly 100 HP volunteers commit a day of service with our staff and our charity to work at the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers. We did this last year at the school, and this year it's at the Family Works. It's a terrific effort, so thank you Michael and to all of your colleagues. I'm Brooks Cullum, Chairman of the Salesmanship Club Charitable Golf of Dallas. 
 Following Byron's passing we established two significant award programs in his honor, both are designed to continue his legacy of serving youths and their family, but they do it in slightly different manners. The Byron Nelson Junior Golf Awards are designed to carry on Byron's legacy of encouraging young golfers. We believe that by recognizing junior golfers and bringing them to this event we benefit the future of golf, we enrich our commitment to young golfers, and it shows and reinforces the strong interest that he had both in the game of golf and in his community. 
 So far we have recognized nine junior golfers from around the world as recipients of the Byron Nelson International Golf Award. Already this year we honor three more athletes. Gentlemen, please stand so we can recognize you. 
 (Applause.)
 BROOKS CULLUM: Let me tell you about these young men. Yaroslav Merkulov, who was born in Russia 18 years ago and lives now in Penfield, New York is currently ranked No. 6 in the "Golfweek" Junior Golf rankings and in the Polo Junior Golf rankings. Last year he won the New York State Golf Association's Junior Championship, and later that summer became the youngest golfer ever to win the men's amateur in New York. He volunteers at a local food bank and mentors students in an elementary school. Next year he will attend Duke on a golf scholarship. Bobby Wyatt is from Mobile, Alabama, where he played golf from the time he was in the 7th grade on the varsity high school team. He is ranked 5 in "Golfweek" and No. 2 in the Polo rankings. 
 At age 13 he won the Alabama State High School individual championship, has repeated that feat in 2008, 2009, and, again last week. Bobby is committed to giving back to his community, the Walk for a Cure, the Ronald McDonald charities and the Coastal Clean-Up, and earlier this year he won the 2010 HP Junior Boys Championship. 
 He will attend the University of Alabama on a golf scholarship next fall and last but not least, Jordan Spieth, a local kid who is currently ranked number 1 in America in both rankings. He is the reigning U.S. Junior Champion and represented the United States in the Junior Ryder Cup and the Spirit teams, and he volunteers for Birdies for Kids and Night Lights and teaches Sunday School in his church. 
 As you know, Jordan will tee it Thursday with a sponsor exemption in this tournament, the youngest amateur ever received -- youngest person to ever receive an exemption, amateur or professional. Since 1980 only nine amateurs have received the sponsor exemption: Mark O'Meara, Scott Verplank, Justin Leonard, Aaron Baddeley, and a young man named Tiger Woods. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, not only are these young men outstanding athletes but outstanding citizens, please join me in applauding them. 
 (Applause.) 
 BROOKS CULLUM: Now I would like to call on the president of the Salesmanship Club club of Dallas, Scott Ragland to present the Byron Nelson Prize. 
 SCOTT RAGLAND: Thank you, Brooks. The Salesmanship Club initiated the Byron Nelson Prize to honor our tournament's namesake and dear, dear friend Byron Nelson. This prize is to be presented to a person or organization in the world of golf who exemplifies the ideals of giving back to the community that Byron personified. This year we received many nominations of men and women who have translated success with the game of golf and its service into their own communities, just as Byron did throughout his entire life. The permanent trophy recognizing the honoree includes a wooden clock, one of 14 that were unfinished by Byron in his wood shop. 
 In addition, we will contribute $100,000 to the honoree's charity of choice as a key part of the prize. It is our privilege and pleasure to present the 2010 Byron Nelson Prize to one of Byron's favorite men. Tom Watson's career is filled with championships. As a teenager he won four state Missouri State Amateurs, 1968 to 1971, and then he won the first of his eight major championships, the Carnoustie, he won five British Opens, two Masters titles and one U.S. Open. 
 Last year at nearly 60 years old and 26 years after his last major victory, he led most of the British Open, and he inspired us all. However, it was here, actually, at Preston Trails that Tom Watson became our greatest champion. He played in 28 consecutive Byron Nelson Tournaments every single year from which he turned pro until he went on to the Champions Tour. He won four times here, more than any other player, and of those victories, Byron wrote in his autobiography, "Those particular years were a great deal of fun for me, since I could enjoy going out on the course and watching Tom in person." 
 With us today is one of the tournament chairmen from 1978 who was fortunate enough to give Tom one of his Byron Nelson trophies, Mike Massad, will you stand up? 
 (Applause.) 
 SCOTT RAGLAND: Tom Watson is clearly a man Byron Nelson loved and respected and who is deserving of receiving the 2010 Byron Nelson Prize. Will you welcome at this time Mrs. Peggy Nelson. 
 (Applause.) 
 PEGGY NELSON: Thank you, Scott. It is so thrilling to be here on this special day when we kick off this tournament and open things up for the whole world to see. I am so delighted to be part of this still and enjoy coming here every day that I get to come and participate. 
 Byron said -- this was several years ago I think that Steve Barley, who was our tournament chairman that year, used this quote from Byron and it was: "This is the best thing that ever happened to me in golf. It's better than winning the Masters, better than the 11 in a row, because it helps people." And Byron was a giver and a helper all of his life. 
 I don't know if you know this guys, I don't think I told you this, but when Byron started working after he left school at an early age, we won't say when, he went to work because his father was not going to let him play golf all the time. He said, "You go to school or go to work," so he did get a job, and as soon as he saved enough money, he bought his parents their first radio. So it was kind of a neat way for him to start giving back to the ones that meant the most to him, and he said that the greatest blessing in his life was being raised in a Christian home. And the other thing that he said that I think is so evident in his life and the lives of all of you people here, the Salesmanship Club guys, you young men and Tom, is, "We never know how many people we influence," so I'm pleased to be here to welcome you all to a great tournament and a great week. Thank you. 
 (Applause.) 
 SCOTT RAGLAND: And Mr. Boone Pickens. 
 BOONE PICKENS: Scott, thank you. Of course I'm proud to be a part of this honor today. It's -- you know, I think back last year, it almost seems like yesterday, and I think that's what happens as you get older, that the years go very, very fast. I don't want y'all to since happy birthday to me, but my birthday this week, and I'll be 82 years old. 
 (Applause.) 
 BOONE PICKENS: So, you know, when you're 82 and you still get to participate, that's a big deal! Last year -- I almost -- I don't know whether Tom likes for you to say this or not, but last year at the British Open -- maybe it brings back some kinda memories that he doesn't want to -- I know there have been deals that I've been in that -- where I almost made it but I didn't and I'd just as soon somebody wouldn't mention it, but Tom -- I told him a while ago he never was my favorite golfer, one of those guys from Oklahoma State -- I've got a bunch of those, and those are my favorite golfers, but Tom, I was always for him if he wasn't beatin' one of those guys.
 But last British Open, I got into that thing, and it just made me sick, the conclusion of it! I could not believe it, because after he hit the drive, it was perfect and I thought, "We got it now. The old guy wins" and old guys love for old guys to win! (Laughter.) 
 Anyway, it made me sick, and I told him he's moved up into the top three of my favorite golfers now! (Laughter.) And Tom is a guy -- he's a great guy, everybody knows what a fine person he is, plus being a great golfer, but he's always given back to his community, Kansas City, and I feel like I've been generous with my community, too, so Tom, the donation today of $100,000 you're leaving to Bruce Edwards Foundation for ALS research and the First Tee of Greater Kansas City, two great organizations I know (Applause.) so thank you. Scott, are you ready? 
 SCOTT RAGLAND: Peggy, will you join us? Ladies and gentlemen the winner of the 2010 Byron Nelson Prize, Mr. Tom Watson. 
 (Applause.) 
 (Standing ovation.) 
 TOM WATSON: I'm looking at the unfinished clock that Byron made; it has a few scratches going across the grain here, Peggy! That's what I loved about Byron, when he was learning how to woodwork, he had a great passion for it, he had a passion for woodworking more than just about anything else he did in life. He asked an expert woodworker to grade him, and Peggy, correct me if I'm wrong, he graded him with a "B "? 
 PEGGY NELSON: 9 out of 10. 
 TOM WATSON: Okay, 9 out of 10, and then Byron asked him: "What can I do to get better?" And it was just as humble -- that showed the humility of the man that said "I'm trying the best I can, but I know I make mistakes. How do I get better?" 
 Byron was always one to ask questions, and I'll get to that later but first of all, a fourth grade exercise here. I would like to ask everybody who met Byron to raise their hand. How many people would have liked to have met Byron? Well, this is why we're here. Byron was a man that -- there are so many things I can say about him, but in simple terms Byron said things simply. He said things that told you a lot, in just a few words. He taught me a lot more than just golf, much, much, more than golf. People asked me about -- they asked me in the interviews today, what did Byron teach you about the golf swing, and I said, "Well, he taught me a few things." He taught me how to look at things more positively as far as my golf swing is concerned. I was hitting badly, I would go down to Preston Trails over here -- this fly is getting to me here. (Laughter.) He would look at me duck hooking or hitting the ball straight right, and he would say, "You know what I like about that golf swing?" And I would say to myself, there is nothing I like about that golf swing! (Laughter.) 
 He was not a critical person. He didn't say bad things about people. He was strong in his faith, strong in his convictions, but he was a very low-key type of guy, except when you got him on the golf course and you ask him to hit a golf shot. More about that later. There is one time that I have to say about Byron, he got the hair on the back of his neck ruffled, and he told me a story about the time when he was a pro at Inverness. Up in Toledo, Ohio, it was a course where he was involved with, there was a guy there named Frank Stranahan, a rich kid, and he went out to the golf course -- get it, Babe! Can you still hit it? (Laughter.) 
 (Applause.) 
 TOM WATSON: He got it, all right! Frank Stranahan, he talked about him, and he said that one of the members came up to him and he said you know Frank Stranahan is going around the club -- Frank was a fine, amateur player now, and he did well in the national amateurs and did well playing in some big golf tournaments, and he practiced all the time because he had all the time to practice. 
 This member came up to Byron, and said you know, Frank is going around telling everybody that he's better than you. That he can beat you anytime that you're not any good. And Byron who was in the pro shop, he was -- one day Frank walked into the pro shop and Byron kept this in his mind and he looked at Frank and he said "Frank, understand you think you're a little bit better than I am on the golf course?" And it wasn't just tongue and cheek, I think it was, let's go out and prove it. He said, "Let's go out and prove it, back tees, all putts holed." They went out and played. Byron shot a 63, and there was never any word after that about Frank being better than Byron Nelson. 
 My story with Byron really goes back to Doral. I was playing in the Pro-Am, and out on the golf course walks Byron Nelson. He was doing ABC Television, and he walked up to me and I recognized him because I watched him on ABC and he walked up to me and he said, "Tom, I would like to meet you" just like that. And that started a great, great relationship that lasted many years. The most celebrated story is one at Winged Foot in 1974 when I had the lead in the U.S. Open, shot 79, choked it away, and I was up in the second story of the clubhouse, having a beer with my friend, John Mahafee, and in walks Byron. Place goes silent, here he is, Lord Byron, and he stops at the doorway and says "Tom, can I speak with you for exactly 5 minutes?" "Sure," and that started a wonderful relationship where he said to me in his typical Nelsonesque terms he said, "I love the way you played yesterday. You've got a fine golf swing; today you were just a little bit off. I think you got a little fast, which is typical to do when you have a chance to wins the U.S. Open. I know about what I speak. I like the way you conduct yourself on the golf course, always have, and if you ever want to come down to Fairways Ranch in Texas I would love to house you. Louise, at that time, and I would love to house you and we'll work on your golf swing." 
 At that time I had Stan Thurst as my teacher, and I said, "Thank you, Byron," and actually in 1975 -- another story came up, and I didn't really go see Byron, getting ahead of myself, until 1976. But in '75 another wonderful moment happened for me, and that was prior to the last round of the British Open in Carnoustie, I'm practicing over at Montafee Golf Course, and I drove to the course early because of the traffic, didn't know how long the traffic was going to be, so I had a lot of time to kill. First British Open, I'm jumping around like a chicken with his head cut off because I'm nervous and I see coming out of the tent Chris Schenkel and Byron, and Byron said, "Tom, come over here, I have something to say to you," and he said, "Good luck today." And I said, "Thank you, Byron," and I said "Byron, do you have anything you might say, would you help me out? What should I do today?" 
 And he said "Tom, today is a different day. The wind is starting to blow, and if you shoot around even par you're going to be right there, so set your sights for even par, and you'll have a chance for winning this golf tournament, and that's exactly what happened. I got into a playoff with Jack and won the next day. 
 In 1976 is when I did give him a call, and it was after a particularly poor year on the golf course. I didn't win any tournaments, and I ended up in the fall of '76 I gave him a call and said, "Byron, do you mind if I come down?" and that was the first of many times I went down there. And we worked on the golf game, and it helped just being around the man, to listen to his stories about -- because I was an amateur, and I loved to listen to him about his stories, the players he played with, players whom he knew, Sarazen, Hagen, "Do you know Bobby Jones, Jimmy Demaret? What were they like? And I got a firsthand from the horse's mouth, and those were the stories after we worked on the golf swing that meant more to me than working on my golf swing. 
 Louise had a stroke, it was a debilitating stroke and this was I believe in about 1983, and Byron, typical Byron, stayed with that woman for two years without even going out of the house. You people well know, the people like Mike, you know about this, and a lot of people don't know, but he stayed with Louise for all those years, those two years. He lost 30 pounds, he was morose, he was not the Byron that I knew. I went down to visit him a number of times, tried to cheer him up and let him bounce some things off me, and I hope it helped, I think it did. 
 Louise finally passed, and when she passed, there was somewhat of a wait that went off, but there was also a big hole there to fill, and it wasn't too long after that that Byron called me for some advice. And here is the man I'm going to advice for, he called me for advice. And it had to do with this woman up in, where was it, Dayton, Ohio, I think it was. And he said "Tom" -- he tells me the story about meeting Peggy and the conversations that went after that. And he said, "Do you think it's too soon to start having feelings for somebody?" 
 Simple, did I think it was too soon. And I said, "Byron, you have to follow your heart. You're a Christian man. You know what's right for you. You'll find out what's right for you." 
 We played a practice round -- not we played, but I was on the first tee waiting to play a practice round at Inverness at Toledo, and Byron always attended the PGA, and it was summer, August, and here comes Byron walking up to the tee. I'm waiting over there for the practice round. I see this Cheshire cat grin on his face, and I see Bud Walsh who was in the umbrella business with Byron way back when, and Bud had this grin on his face, and I knew something was up. 
 Byron came over to the tee and he said "Tom, I have something special I want to tell ya," and before he could get it out of his mouth I said "You're gettin' married"! And he said "uh-huh" and that started a wonderful, wonderful life with Peggy. Great life with Peggy. And I never saw them going anywhere without holding hands, he always thanked her for everything she did, and it was wonderful to see such a great, great relationship. I couldn't fill his shoes on the golf course ever, he was about the finest player I ever saw play the game. But in his relationships with Peggy, I'd never seen somebody that had such a love and a humble love for another person as Byron Nelson did for Peggy. That's what you learn from being around Byron Nelson. The golf was incidental, it was the character of the man, that's what I will forever be grateful for. You know, I'm a lot better person because I met Byron, and I said he had a strong faith in his God. Very strong faith in his God. When I called Peggy when he died, I said what normal people say, I said to her "I'm so sorry. I am so sorry" and she said, "Don't be sorry. He's right where he wants to be. He's out of the time and the space of the material world, and he's in his own spiritual world." 
 That's what Byron Nelson was all about, and that's why you people work so hard to make this tournament a success and why it is a success. You don't have anybody's name better than Byron Nelson on your golf tournament. We thank HP, Mr. Pickens, thank you very much for underwriting this award that's going to go also to another charity, a charity close to my heart, Children's Mercy Hospital, takes kids in that can't pay and treats them anyway. I'm very grateful, you don't know how grateful I am to have my name go on this wonderful and slightly flawed trophy. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, very much. 
 (Applause.) 
 SCOTT RAGLAND: Thank you, Tom, and congratulations once again. As I mentioned, the Byron Nelson Prize comes with a $100,000 contribution to a charity. That contribution will be made in Tom's name to the Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, the Robert Packard Center for ALS Research and the First Tee Scholarship Program of Greater Kansas City. Tom, on behalf of the Salesmanship Club of Dallas, thank you and congratulations. 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: Scott, thank you. One day I will be able to tell my grandchildren I shew a fly from the face of Tom Watson. (Laughter.)
 TOM WATSON: And you completed the touchdown! 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: My big fear was I would hit him. I have been known to throw an interception or two! (Laughter.) It was interesting with Peggy and Boone and the photo shot when Mr. Watson came up to receive the award. Byron Nelson's name is on the tournament, the statue as you enter on the property, there is a statue in the lobby, and I thought if I stand behind them here there is no way the other stations will be able to use this shot! The other local stations aren't fond of putting the anchor from the CBS affiliate on their air (Laughter.) And I was all set to do it, and I thought, what would Byron do? So as you noticed, I scooted out of the shot and my colleagues have their shot. 
 Tom, I know you have some special friends that we would like to welcome here today, Chip Brewer and Max Puglielli of Adams Golf? 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: And a special friend of the Byron Nelson Championship Holly Wilson, Director of Global Sponsorships at Master Card. 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: Now I would like to say I've put some money into the pockets of some people up here. Mike Mendenhall, I just bought an HP computer three weeks ago, completely satisfied with it, love it, first HP, recommend it highly and this is not a paid endorsement. (Laughter.) Now on the other hand, Peggy Nelson was kind enough to give me a free copy of "Life with Lord Byron"! Thank you. (Laughter.) 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: Now many, many years ago I also put some money into the pocket of Tom Watson, because I bought this instructional book, it's quite weathered but it's "Getting Up and Down: How to Save Strokes from 40 Yards and In" and it is the best instructional book I've ever read. My chipping and putting are pretty darn good, not commensurate with my game. Every year after Cowboy season and the golf season picks up, I get my book out and my wife thinks I'm an idiot, and I've had this 25 years and she said, "When are you going to finish that book"? And I said, "No, you don't understand" (Laughter.) And Byron Nelson's rocking chair approach to chipping is in here! 
 TOM WATSON: That's been on the bathroom floor for how long? (Laughter.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: I wasn't going to say where I read the book, but let me say that I get an opportunity to browse through it about three times a day. (Laughter.) I'm a man, I don't know what to tell you! (Laughter.) It's a phenomenal book. I may ask Mr. Watson to sign it later. I've got a 12 year old and a 15 year old and they want autographs from the athletes that you interview, and I say, "I can't do that!" I just sat down with Dirk Nowitzki and they said, "Dad, you were two feet away from him. You had a pen in your hand" and I said, "I know how it works. I just can't do that," but I'm going to make an exception and ask Mr. Watson to sign this. 
 Already what makes this Championship so special is that it recognizes the unselfish nature of its namesake, Byron Nelson. Mr. Watson and Peggy have shared with us, he cared about other people and especially children, so welcome the third grade class from the J. Erik Jonsson Community School. 
 (Applause.) 
 (Performing third grade) 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: Outstanding. All right, before we dismiss, we get the HP Byron Nelson Championship started for 2010, two things I would like to say: Number 1, again, "Getting Up and Down," okay, "How to save strokes from 40 yards and In," and I keep waiting for you to write the follow up for how to get those first 400 yards in. (Laughter.) I know Boone asked us not to sing happy birthday, so third graders, do you know happy birthday? Can we sing it to Boone and maybe everybody can join in? Ready? 
 (Third grade and audience singing happy birthday to Boone Pickens.)
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: And that as they say in the business is an "ender"! Congratulations to Mr. Tom Watson. Salesmanship Club of Dallas, thank you. 
 (Applause.) 
 BABE LAUFENBERG: And here is to a great HP 2010 Byron Nelson Championship! Thanks, everybody.
