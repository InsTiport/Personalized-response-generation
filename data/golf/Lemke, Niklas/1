 Q. How good was that first round?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: It was good. Very satisfied. Played really good at the end. So it was nice.

 Q. That back nine was terrific, wasn't it. 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: Putter felt really good from the start, and then they just started dropping at the end.

 Q. You'd better take me through what's happened since Sunday, because you finished at the Nordea Masters, and suddenly you're in this event and you have to plan everything. 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: No, we had a good time on Sunday night, and then took it pretty easy on Monday. Had a little struggle with the flight going over here, but I feel good. I feel quite fresh for this week. 

 Q. A struggle just trying to book something and just trying to get here?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: Our flight got delayed, quite a few hours, so only played 11 holes on the practise round. 

 Q. And the combination and everything, that was all sorted, no problem?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: I got a little bit of help with, that so it's all good. 

 Q. What are your impressions of Killarney?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: I like it. This lake is amazing. I just want to go out there and fish, but I like the place.

 Q. Are you a fisherman?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: It's been a long time since I was out the last time but it's fun.

 Q. There's plenty of chance to relax in an afternoon I guess, so you can find some rods and get out there. 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: True. I'll probably just practise a little bit and take it easy and wheel see. 

 Q. Having seen a course for the first time, I presume it's almost immediately to your liking.
 NICKLAS LEMKE: I like it. The greens really fit my eye, and it suits my game very well.

 Q. Are you good at just adapting to a new course straightaway. 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: I'd say. So I'm pretty familiar and I know how to adapt to different golf courses, playing on The Challenge Tour and all over Europe, you get pretty good at it. 

 Q. What are your thoughts coming into this? Is this all a bit of a bonus, or are you determined to make good fortune of being here?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: It's a bonus of being here and while I'm here I might as well try to make the best of it, so I'm looking forward to the week.

 Q. Clearly you saw what the clamour as well about with your own National Open, but you must appreciate how good the crowds are out here. 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: This morning teeing off, I was telling my caddie, it's like 8.30 and I don't know how many people are out here but there were a bunch following Rory and those guys. It's good to see. 

 Q. Do I detect an American twang? Did you go to college?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: Yes, Arizona State for four years, 2003 until 2007. 

 Q. Any famous graduates with you? Did you cross over Mr. Fowler? 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: No, he was a year after me. I played three years with Alejandro CaÃ±izares, Jamie Lovemark and a lot of good guys, and Dustin Johnson and those guys. 

 Q. Was Dustin in your class?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: Yeah, I think we graduated in the same year.

 Q. Still in touch?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: No, I never played with Dustin. Their school played in a different conference than we did. 

 Q. And The Challenge Tour, how long have you been doing that?
 NICKLAS LEMKE: This is my first year of full status. I played pretty well last year on invites, so I got full status this year. 

 Q. Going okay? Enjoying it? 
 NICKLAS LEMKE: Yeah, I'm enjoying this. So definitely. It's fun.
