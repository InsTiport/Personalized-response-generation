 Q.  So first time playing, how was it, playing with all these top players and just being there?  
LIYANA DURISIC: On the 10th tee, I was like really nervous, but then I went into the bunkers.  I was like, oh, no.  But then after that, after the bogey I had on the 10th, it was like really good.  I had like pars and I went into the water, but I saved par.  So it was like really good until the second nine, I kind of fumble a little bit.  But overall it was okay.  I wasn't nervous.   
 Q.  Did you speak to the players with you?  
LIYANA DURISIC: No, no, I didn't.  I just spoke to the caddies.  The caddies asked me what age am I, and when I said I'm 16, they are like, "Oh, you're so young."   
 Q.  So what's your strategy for tomorrow?  Any changes in your play or anything?  
LIYANA DURISIC: No, I'm just going to, I think I would like to play more like safe because I was like attacking everything, and then it just rolls off the green.  Yeah, I think I'm going to take a club shorter tomorrow, as well.
