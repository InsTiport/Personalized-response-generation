Q. Will, another solid week for you.  If I can get some comments on your week.
WILL ZALATORIS:   Yeah, Josh Gregory, my short game, putting, practice coach found a little something after Thursday.  Really rolled it well Friday and Saturday.  Didn't really make much today.
Yeah, awesome week.  Just kind of needed a little break after missing the cut last week at Mississippi.  Yeah, 10 out of 11 kind of have a little right to be a little tired.
But, yeah be a lot of fun this week.
Q. Anything that he shared with you that you want to share with the media or is it something that you just...
WILL ZALATORIS:   No, yeah, I was kind of fading away a little bit on my putts.  I wasn't staying in my posture and I probably didn't do the best job with it today, but it was nice going 64, 64, no bogeys.
So obviously we're on the right track, and be fun to go to bermuda and see how things shake out.  I think I needed a two-way for fifth and I know I am sitting with a three-way tie, so we'll see.  Either way I'm pretty close to getting my card.
