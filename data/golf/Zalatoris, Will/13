 Q.  Back in the round of 16.  It's been a couple years.  How does that feel?  
WILL ZALATORIS: Good.  Obviously a lot happened between then and now, so I'm excited.   
 Q.  Got off to a quick start today.  Up 3 after six holes.  How did you do it?  
WILL ZALATORIS: Yeah, you know, as crazy as it sounds, there was already kind of a turnaround on the second hole.  He was in the middle of the fairway and I was basically up against the driving range and chipped out, and then pulled my next shot into the left bunker to a tucked pin and he pulled his up on the hill.  Got a little lucky, and I ended up pulling my bunker shot for par and he makes bogey.   
(Wind) to have at least a 1-up advantage, but I swung it early and (Wind interference.)  I think being 3-up through six was huge.   
 Q.  (Wind interference.)  Birdied 5 and 6.  
WILL ZALATORIS: Yeah, 5 was giving was everybody (wind).   
 Q.  Yeah?  
WILL ZALATORIS: Yeah.  And 6 I had a 35-footer and he had about 15 feet for par.  I ended up just making it anyway.   
 Q.  And then he came back at you a little bit and then you had to par the 13th hole to go back to 2-up.  
WILL ZALATORIS: Yeah, just like I said, I just wasn't hitting fairways.  I was just scrambling pretty much the entire back nine.  I think I technically only hit two greens on the back; had a couple on the fringe.   
Was basically putting on four holes for birdie and (Wind interference.)  That was -- I need to change that.  (Wind interference.)  That 60-degree is 12 (wind) and I had 3-wood in there and another 3-wood on 14 to make par -- or 13, excuse me.   
(Wind interference.)
