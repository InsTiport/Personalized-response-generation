Q. Will Zalatoris, 1-over 71.  A good round out there.  What do you take from the week?
WILL ZALATORIS:   It was a great experience.  I've been playing well all year.  I just found out that obviously top 10 gets us into next year too, so that's obviously pretty exciting.  Hopefully, it holds.  I think it will.
Yeah, I've been really working hard over the past couple of years, and nice to finally see it pay off on the big stage.
Q. It looks like a two-man race out there.  What are you expecting?  What's it going to take to win?
WILL ZALATORIS:   Like 17, for example, I hit a bad tee shot and laid up to the fairway.  I hit a sand wedge from 148, and I think it landed like 122, and it skipped all the way back to ten feet short.
Those greens are getting crusty.  They're getting crazy fast too.  So, I mean, just keep it in front of you, and obviously just be careful with your speed on the greens.
Q. What's your schedule now going forward?
WILL ZALATORIS:   I'm playing Puntacana next week.  We've got two more events on the Korn Ferry Tour between now and the end of the year.  Hopefully, get a couple more TOUR starts between now and the end of the year.
