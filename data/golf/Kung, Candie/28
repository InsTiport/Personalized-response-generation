  Q. Tell us about the wait.   
 CANDIE KUNG: The wait?   
  
  Q. Was that tough, to finally finish?  
 CANDIE KUNG: Yeah, yeah, of course. You know, I just told myself to come out here and enjoy the people out here and enjoy the last day of the U.S. Open.   
 I don't think I've ever been like the last three groups in the final round. But that's what I did.   
 I told myself to come out here and enjoy it. It was a slow round the last few days. We know there's going to be a wait on the course and just go out there and have fun.  
  
  Q. Strong finish, 2-under in the final round of the Women's Open, and you've kind of got to watch the scoreboard. What's your emotions as things are unfolding?  
 CANDIE KUNG: I was very proud of myself shooting red number at the U.S. Open, especially the last two rounds.   
 Like I said before, I was just going out there trying to make par all the way around. Par is going to be a good score by the end of the week, which it did. Even par won the tournament, and you know, I was happy.   
  
  Q. Talk about 16. I mean, you drove it in the rough, and then to make that par putt, did you feel at that point, hey, I'm in charge here?  
 CANDIE KUNG: I didn't look at the leaderboard at all, at all, all day. There was nothing I could do on that shot but chip it out and then have a shot on the green, have a putt at it for par, and it happened to go in it.  
  
  Q. Despite going into the bunker at 17 you almost made the putt at 17 for par?  
 CANDIE KUNG: Yeah, yeah, that was close. I thought it was in. Hit a great bunker shot there, too. But that tee shot was an error from my end, and I knew the wind was coming out from the right and I just didn't play enough.
