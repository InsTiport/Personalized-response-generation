 Q.  You had a really good day today.  Looked back and forth, but you had an eagle and birdied the last hole.  How are you feeling?  
CANDIE KUNG: Feeling pretty good right now.  Actually my game has been pretty good all year.  I just had a little bit of mental issues going on earlier in the year.   
Was probably the most relaxed I've had the last two days out of the whole year.  Hopefully I can keep going.   
 Q.  Good.  You've played in every single Kingsmill event.  Doing my research.  What is it about this place that makes it so special?  
CANDIE KUNG: I love it here.  For some reason this golf course just looks like it's a course for somebody who has golf game.  I don't know if it's because the men's play here before.  The way they set up the golf course, it's super.   
 Q.  Great.  How do you feel going into the weekend?  
CANDIE KUNG: I'm going to try to do the same I did the last couple days.  Try to stay as relaxed as I can and not try to force anything.  Hopefully few putts will drop again.
