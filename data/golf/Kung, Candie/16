CANDIE KUNG: I'll take every week, right.
Q. Some positives you can take out of the week?
CANDIE KUNG: Oh, yeah, for sure.  Like I said, I'll take that every week.  Top five every week, having the lead going into the last day, nothing to complain.  I putted great.  I was -- I don't know where my brain was on the front nine, but I played pretty good on the back nine.
Q. What did you see from Lydia today?
CANDIE KUNG: She played consistent.  I mean, I was expecting a lot more out of her.  But she played consistent and had 1-under.
Q. You bounced back nicely after the front nine.
CANDIE KUNG: Yeah, I don't know, it was just a weird front nine.  I wasn't nervous, nothing at all.  I was feeling comfortable, normal.  And it just didn't happen.
Q. Going to Alabama?
CANDIE KUNG: Yes, I am.  I'm hoping to get there, somehow, some day, before Thursday.
Q. I don't think there's a direct flight.
CANDIE KUNG: No.
Q. But you have a private jet though, right?
CANDIE KUNG: No.
