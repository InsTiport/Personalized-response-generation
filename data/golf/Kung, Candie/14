CANDIE KUNG: Overall I'm happy with my performance today.  Although I really am very much distraught with the windy conditions.  There is no way you really have time to think about who is behind you, who ahead of you, and in what way on course you can catch up or whatever.  You just do your best.   
 Q.  (What will it take to win tomorrow)?  
CANDIE KUNG: And tomorrow, if you can really save pars, then you probably will have a shot to win the title.  It's really a very, very hard course here.  This is probably one of the hardest courses I've ever seen, and the course itself is full of slopes and sometimes it really feels like you're taking a roller coaster ride.   
In addition to the windy conditions, you have to pay attention to the crosswinds.  Tomorrow, if you can really get close to even par, you can probably win it.  Patience means everything.  Yesterday I mentioned patience and today, definitely patience will play a key role as far as strategy.   
In my own group, basically have been doing pretty well, although the bouncy grass situation has really made everybody feel it's very hard to tackle the course in the conditions.  Also, I feel that the adjustment of the pin positions today, for example on hole 14, helped the players a little bit, otherwise it could be even more difficult to tackle.   
I feel that as far as tomorrow, I would like just to simply survive the day.  I won't think too much about winning the title at this stage.
