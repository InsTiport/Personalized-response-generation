  Q. (Question regarding Yani) You're also from Taiwan; you're tied in the rankings. Tell us about that.   
 CANDIE KUNG: Well, she got herself all the attention from her good play. I'm more like a big sister to her. She's a good friend of mine, and very happy for her that she actually got to that No. 1 spot and able to keep it there.  
 She's able to bring a lot of the spectators out here this week. I think to make this tournament possible, she played a big part. You know, I had that dream, and I couldn't achieve it when I was in my prime, which was nine years ago. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. How old are you now?  
 CANDIE KUNG: I'm 30.  
  
  Q. What would it mean to you to win here?  
 CANDIE KUNG: It would be great. I've been playing pretty consistent the last few weeks, just everything hasn't been coming together. It would be great to win here, because I think a lot of people know me, too. They know who I am and they come out and watch. They've never seen LPGA before.   
 So it will be fun.  
  
  Q. What do you think of the crowds this week?  
 CANDIE KUNG: It's awesome. I was surprised how many people come out and watch. And it's going to be more for Saturday and Sunday. And the weather is going to be better, too.
