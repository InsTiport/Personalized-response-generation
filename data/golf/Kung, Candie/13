 Q.  Your thoughts on a really, really good week overall.  Obviously you were very close.  Do you feel good about the week overall?  
CANDIE KUNG: The week overall, if you look at how I started the week, you wouldn't think I would be where I'm at right now:  Bogey, bogey, double start for the week.  Finishing 1-under, very happy with the way I played and the way I battled out there.  And if it's mine, it wouldn't have gone away and I would have made the last two putts, a 3-footer and a whatever, 10-footer.   
 Q.  For the two last holes, how critical were they coming down the stretch?  These greens are just so tough.  
CANDIE KUNG: They bounce.  I've been pretty lucky all week that it has not bounced on me too much.  But the last two, that was crucial.  But like I said, if it's mine, it would have gone in.   
 Q.  When was the last time you've been in the hunt back and forth like that?  
CANDIE KUNG: Portland.  Well, Portland wasn't so -- Portland, Canada, I was up there with Lydia.  She just pulled it off.  Glad to be back on the top.   
 Q.  The whole day it was you, Sei Young and Stacy back and forth.  
CANDIE KUNG: It was so hard out there.  I mean, you can't worry about what other people are doing.  We're just trying to hold the umbrella; is it going to rain; is it not going to rain, and then all of a sudden, it's not raining.  We don't know what to do.  It was hard out there.  It was busy out there.   
 Q.  What about her putt on 18 to clinch that, how clutch was that?  
CANDIE KUNG: That was a great putt.
