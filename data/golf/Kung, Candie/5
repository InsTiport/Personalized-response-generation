Q. First points on the board for team Chinese Taipei today.  What was the key to your win?
CANDIE KUNG: I played pretty consistent, just like I did the last few days.  We both played pretty good, actually.  I just got lucky, made a couple of putts.
Q. You're pretty laid-back as a player, you kind of brought that approach to your team this week.  Do you feel like that's been an advantage in match play?
CANDIE KUNG: Yeah, yeah, I think so.  There was a lot of players that wanted to be aggressive, and I'm just somehow the other way.
