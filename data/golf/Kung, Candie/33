Q.
Candy, right off the bat I noticed you did not miss a fairway today.  That's a pretty good start on this golf course?

CANDIE KUNG:  Yeah, it's pretty good to keep the ball in the fairway.  That's all I was trying to do, keep it in the short grass.

And it's got long second shots out here, and I was trying to hit fairway woods, and if I hit the green, great, just trying to play par.
Q.  Well, you are a former U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links champion.  Is there something about USGA championships that suits your game?

CANDIE KUNG:  Yes, I love the USGA tournaments.  First of all, it's well organized, and I guess the golf courses fits my game, I guess.  I hit it pretty straight.  I hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways.  And I don't make a whole lot of mistakes, just pretty much keep myself into contention.
Q.  Do you like your position now, will that enable you to go on and do really well tomorrow?

CANDIE KUNG:  Yeah, I like where I'm sitting at right now.  There's still afternoon people to play.  This afternoon the winds start picking up.  It's looking pretty good and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

I'm feeling a little better with my swing than yesterday, so we'll see how it goes.
Q.  How many times have you played 36 holes in one day when it counted?

CANDIE KUNG:  The Women's Public Links.  I can't remember.  But I've just got to go home and get rest tonight and go out tomorrow and have fun and enjoy the round.
