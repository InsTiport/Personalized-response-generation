Q.   How do you reflect on a tough day out on the course today? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, the weather wasn't easy, especially the beginning was very windy and very cold.   Yeah, it wasn't easy.

Q.   Did you enjoy it? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, I enjoyed it.   It was a bit special for me to play with so many people, a very nice feeling.

Q.   To start with, certainly on the front nine, you looked so enjoyable, as well, as if you were just so calm and just enjoying the fun and the crowd that was supporting you. 
VICTOR RIU:   Sure, of course.   I was doing well, so I was very happy.   It was a nice feeling so enjoyed a lot. 

Q.   The back nine, a little bit up and down. 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, after that, the back nine, I think it's much tougher, and yeah, a bit frustrated.   I made a bad bogey on 15, three putts.   16 was an easy chip and I didn't do a good chip, and on 17, I missed a very short putt.   It was important to finish well on 18, so I'm very happy to do a good par on the 18th. 

Q.   Presumably knowing your position into the final round, you have to be very positive about that. 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, sure of course, I'm happy. 

Q.   Your thoughts about The Open Championship, is that something that's going through your mind? 
VICTOR RIU:   No, not really.   Of course it would be very great but my first goal is to play well at this tournament, and if I can play the British, it would be fantastic.   But first thing is to, first goal is to play very good here.
