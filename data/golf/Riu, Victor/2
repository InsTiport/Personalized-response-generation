Q.   A little disappointed I'm sure to bogey the last but overall some tremendous play.   How good does it feel? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, I'm very happy for sure.   Three bogeys at Le National is very good.   Very happy, this bogey from the last one.

Q.   You come from Paris and you're attached to Saint‑Nom‑la‑BretÃ¨che, how well do you know this course? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, I'm playing Saint‑Nom‑la‑BretÃ¨che but most of time when I want to play the course, I come here because the course is so good.   So I used to play here most of the time I'm in Paris.

Q.   You've missed five of your last six cuts.   Did you feel this form coming?   Is there something in you that said, I'm about to play well? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, it didn't feel very good in my game.   My coach arrived here on Monday.   We are training very hard and feel much much better in my game. 

Q.   Your caddie said you putted particularly well; was that the case? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, my putting was crazy especially today.

Q.   What about the football later on.   Are France going to beat Germany? 
VICTOR RIU:   I hope.

Q.   You're going to be watching? 
VICTOR RIU:   For sure. 

Q.   What are your thoughts of being such a lovely position in this tournament at halfway? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, it's a very nice feeling.   Very happy to this. 

Q.   Playing very well? 
VICTOR RIU:   I will say my putting was very, very good.   My tee shot was very average, not big mistake but I don't think I hit so many fairways. 

Q.   Have you sensed in recent weeks that the game is getting better? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, especially I've been working really hard with my coach.   My coach came here.   I've been struggling for two months, missed a lot of cuts, but I feel I'm in better shape.

Q.   I'm sure it's a silly question but how important is this championship to you?
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, of course, I'm French, it's in France, a lot of people are watching for me so it would be great to win one here.

Q.   Did you come as a child to watch this tournament, always interested in it? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, you mean when I was younger?   Yeah, of course I was watching every time, yeah. 

Q.   How well do you know the course? 
VICTOR RIU:   I know very good because most of the time I play here, I live very close from here.   It's good so I can say at home.   Every time I play 18 holes, I come to Le Golf National and play with my friends.

Q.   And does that help knowing where to hit the ball? 
VICTOR RIU:   Yeah, for sure, helps a lot, especially my putting because I know all the slopes.   I'm doing well, better with my putter.
