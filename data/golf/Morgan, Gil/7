  Q. You had a great round today how did you feel about it?  
 GIL MORGAN: Okay. It was working early on, I made some putts for par and I kind of let it get away at the end. So it kind of balanced out, I guess.  
  
  Q. You birdied 17?  
 GIL MORGAN: I did.  
  
  Q. People aren't making par on 17. That's a -- was it into the wind today a little bit?  
 GIL MORGAN: It was. I hit driver, 5-iron. And, but I hit a really he good drive. So I had 185 to the hole.   
  
  Q. How are you finding the conditions today compared to yesterday?  
 GIL MORGAN: Similar. Similar wind and everything. Everything is pretty much the same except it's a little warmer.   
  
  Q. Congratulations plus one is a good score right now.   
 GIL MORGAN: Well thank you.   
  
  Q. Good luck.
