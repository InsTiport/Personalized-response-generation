Q.  How is your practice today?
GIL MORGAN:  Well, it turned out pretty well.  I decided I was just going to play nine holes and I just finished.  It was a little breezy out there, but not too bad.
Q.  Do you feel confident going into tomorrow?
GIL MORGAN:  Not as confident as I would like to be at this point in time.  But at the same time sometimes practice rounds, you can't get up for practice rounds as well as you can tournament play.

So hopefully maybe tomorrow I'll get a little higher as far as my level of concentration and stuff.
Q.  Is it nice to be in your home state?
GIL MORGAN:  Sure.  It's great.  To be able to be right here at home, sleep in your own bed, you don't get to do that very often, especially at Major championship.

So we're looking forward to having the opportunity to be at home here.
