  Q. Talk about your two days so far.   
 GIL MORGAN: I played pretty well today. I kept it in play most of the time. I had a couple of foul balls, but I was able to get those up-and-down. Last hole I just kind of was trying to do a little bit too much with it, I think and mishit it a little bit, and so I ended up with a bogey on the last hole, which is a little disheartening, but at the same time I was glad to get this round in today and I was very pleased with it overall.  
  
  Q. Was it easier to play in the morning in terms of yesterday's flip-flop and were the conditions a little bit better this morning?  
 GIL MORGAN: Conditions were good, not much wind early, a little bit of wind coming down the last few holes, but it played a little bit long, quite a bit longer because of the temperature and everything in the morning. Some of the holes played a club or two longer than what we played yesterday afternoon.   
 But at the same time the greens are probably a little smoother, a little softer. Overall. So I just need to keep it going.
