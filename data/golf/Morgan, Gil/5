Q.   Talk about your round, 2â€‘under. 
GIL MORGAN:   Well, I started pretty good.   Made a couple birdies early and made played the front nine pretty well. 
The back nine I made a couple bogeys and some mistakes there, but maybe salvaged it with a birdie on the last hole.

Q.   How was the course playing today overall?
GIL MORGAN:   Pretty well overall.   I would say it was a little wet, obviously, with the rain and everything, a little distracting.   But all in all I think that they did a good deal with moving a couple of the tees up and stuff. 

Q.   How did the rain affect the greens and the putting speed there?
GIL MORGAN:   Might have slowed them a little bit, but didn't seem to affect them too much really.   The greens were holding fairly decent.   They're a little skip here and then usually a stop.   Defending upon what club you got in.   When you're hitting with hybrid in there, it doesn't stop very well. 

Q.   What about tomorrow?   You got an early time?
GIL MORGAN:   Yeah, nine o'clock.   We play at nine.   I'm sorry planning on just going out there and giving it a go again tomorrow and see how it falls out.   Hopefully it will, I can continue on the path that I am at this point in time and see how it falls.
