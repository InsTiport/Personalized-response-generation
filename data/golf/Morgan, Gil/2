Q. Obviously your home course.  You played two rounds out here.  What do you think about how you have played overall and how the course is playing?GIL MORGAN: Well, yesterday I played decent.  Today I didn't play very well.  I had a lot of mistakes.  I had a couple of double bogeys, made a couple of extra putts which really hurt. But I think the course is playing all right.  It's going to get a little windier than it was yesterday I think overall.  I don't know whether it's going to play any tougher or not.  It should play a little tougher this afternoon than it did yesterday morning.Q. Going out this morning compared to yesterday, the course is probably more dried out.  What made the differences, playing early in the morning or...GIL MORGAN: Well, the greens are a little better I thought.  Yesterday it got a little fuzzy looking, but other than that, I just thought they were still -- they didn't hold quite as well as they did yesterday.  They were just dried out.  There wasn't moisture from the rain. So overall they were fairly receptive, though, still.  So I don't think the guys will have a real hard time.  Just fight the wind a little bit.Q. Finally just overall, how was it playing with your Oak Tree gang and the following you guys got?GIL MORGAN: We're all pretty competitive and everything.  Everybody was trying pretty hard.  Just, you know, trying to survive out here is the hard part.  A lot of pressure to do well.  Just have to go wait and see now.
