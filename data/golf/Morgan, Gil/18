Q.  Tell us about your round since I last talked to you.
GIL MORGAN:  Well, it wasn't too spectacular.  I didn't play nearly as well, obviously.  I did make one birdie and no bogeys on the front.  And then I got to hit my drive at 10.  So that's where I am right now for the restart in the morning.  I don't know, I just probably am a little tired, I would think.  My shot making wasn't not nearly as good as it was early in the day.  So that's about it in a nutshell.
Q.  Well, you're in second place, that's a good place to be.
GIL MORGAN:  Well, it's not too bad.  I've been worse.  That's for sure.
Q.  Talk about the layoff and probably you wanted to keep playing all night the way you were playing.
GIL MORGAN:  I didn't get much sleep last night for one thing.  And then having to sit around all day, I think that tired us out a little bit.  And then it's hard walking when it's soft like that.  So it's a little harder and my heel's bothering me a little bit, so I was kind of tippy-toeing out there.
Q.  Talk about not only playing 8 and a half tomorrow but perhaps even starting that third round.
GIL MORGAN:  Well, I don't think it will be much different than today.  It's just the situation that you just do whatever they call for in that regard.  But hopefully I'll be a little fresher and I might not have to play as many holes, you never know.
Q.  Do you like where you stand right now?
GIL MORGAN:  Well, right now I can't be too disappointed with where my positioning is though, you know, it's not stellar, compared to the rest, but, hey, I'm pretty satisfied with it at this point in time.
