 Q.   Describe your round today.   
GIL MORGAN:   Well, it was kind of up‑and‑down.   I made a few good plays and then I made some, too many bogeys today.   That's basically what happened.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the eagle that you had on the 17th.   
GIL MORGAN:   Well, I just hit a pretty good drive and then I hit a 3‑wood down there about, oh, maybe eight feet and I was able to negotiate it right in there.   
   
 Q.   Any particular areas that you think you need to improve on for the rest of the tournament to move up?  
GIL MORGAN:   Yeah I'm just ‑‑ I mishit a few irons and I misdirected a few drives and so I'll probably go work on that a little bit today.
