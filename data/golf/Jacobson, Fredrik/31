  Q. Very good round of golf?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, well, came out playing really solid. I've been driving the ball great all day. Took a long time before -- made some really nice putts on the last three holes to bring it back to a really good round.   
 On 16, it's a nice opportunity to go for it but -- my opportunities, I figured I would give it a shot at it. Pulled it off today, 15 feet straight past the flag. That was nice and managed to roll that one in.   
  
  Q. And that kind of finish really does make it a brilliant day rather than what would have been a more average, modest day?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, I felt like I was playing really well and wasn't taking advantage of it.   
  
  Q. And a continuation of good form, because you played well last week, didn't you?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, I took a few weeks off after THE TOUR Championship. Last week came out, striking the ball really good out of the blocks. I've been just working hard and working with Callaway on some equipment and didn't really -- it was nice to get back into it.
