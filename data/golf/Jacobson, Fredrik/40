  Q. How are you, welcome back.  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Thank you. I like this golf course. Played recently well the first time and kept playing well here since -- like to come back, and the golf course is fantastic like that it gives you a good feeling. I had a 36-hole qualifier Monday. I felt pretty good after today.  
  
  Q. When you start a round like this, how does it feel?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: You have a feeling that you can do well in the tournament. I've been playing well. I played before. I've been playing a lot of golf. Rested up pretty good.  
  
  Q. The qualifier, Monday qualifier for the U.S. Open?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah. I played in both the British and Colonial, and then I had the 36. It's been a lot of golf, but I'm playing well at the moment. I wanted to come back here again and give it a go.  
  
  Q. How was the weather out there today?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, it's a little tough with the wind. If the wind doesn't pick up, it's okay. Got to be a little bit lucky the wind doesn't pick up in the wrong spot, especially the water holes, hoping to find some sort of comfort when you're hitting your shot. But, yeah.
