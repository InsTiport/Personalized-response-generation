 Q. Did you think you could score like this in the first round? 
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: No, probably not. Probably not. They moved a couple of tees up a little but for us, but it was a tough test of golf. But I'm glad to see that if you play really good golf around here, there were some good scores available, so I'm happy to see that. 

 Q. How would you define really good golf out here? What's the combination? 
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Well, my round today, I hit a lot of fairways. I gave myself a lot of looks at birdies, and you make some and you keep it out of trouble. 
 There's some high grass out there, so you try to avoid that and a bit of water here and there, and so you've got to position yourself to give yourself some chances and I managed to do that very well today.
