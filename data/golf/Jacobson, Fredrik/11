 Q.   How do you feel after your round?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah, I'm very happy, off to a good start again, and really happy I got into the right‑‑ whatever holes I played yesterday, but yeah, I feel like I'm playing tournament golf again.   
   
 Q.   How did the course play today?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah, it was pretty soft.   Obviously we teed off after the rain yesterday, it was pretty soft yesterday and it can stop pretty quick.   I think it's drying up nicely.   
   
 Q.   How do you think where you stand with everyone else, it's a crowded top?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah, there's birdies on the par 5s, and especially for the long hitters can get on in two.   I think you just have to keep playing well and giving yourself chances.   The course is rolling beautifully, and if you play well, you can make a few putts.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah, wind was picking up a little bit at that time, and I went with a hard 9 and just jumped at it and really pulled it and buried it into the bank off the bunker.   I wasn't really sure if I could stop it on the green.   I didn't know if I had a shot, and I thought, I've just got to give it a shot, and it came out.   
I was lucky, it came out perfect, and gave myself a 20‑, 25‑footer for par that I managed to make.   Really, a bonus after a poor approach shot.  
   
 Q.   The drive on 13, down by the water?   
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah, I mean, that one just took a big kick.   It was actually going up the right‑hand side.   Just kicked on the back of the bunker and took a huge bounce forward into the left.   It was good for me.   It only left a 6‑iron.   
So, I'll take it, but it didn't look like a massive bounce, which we aren't expecting in the conditions now, but I'm glad it stopped short.
