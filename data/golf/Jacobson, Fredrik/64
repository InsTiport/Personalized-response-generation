Q.
You played very well obviously. 

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I played solid today, which was nice, and the few shots I missed, I managed to get up-and-down to keep the pressure going.  Thomas birdied the first and got one ahead and then I birdied three in a row, which was nice to get ahead.  I don't think I lost another hole after that.


Q.  With the possibility of walking 36 the next three days, I'm sure it was nice to finish a little bit earlier than 18?

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, it's nice to get a little bit of time to stretch and have something to eat and prepare and get focused for this afternoon.


Q.  You're playing Tiger Woods this afternoon, obviously the world's number one player, but you in your own right have won a lot of tournaments in the last couple of years.  You may not be that well-known here, but this could be a great opportunity for you?

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Certainly.  I saw the chances of us playing each other if I won my match this morning, and that's something I'm looking forward to, a great experience, and I'm playing well at the moment, so hopefully I can keep the same kind of focus for this afternoon.
