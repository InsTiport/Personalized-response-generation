Q.   Just talk about an up‑and‑down match and you came out victorious on the last hole. 
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Well, played Ernie, obviously he's a great match play player and he's just a great player overall.   We had to fight it out a little down the stretch.   It wasn't really pretty on the greens to come down there.   The greens are tricky.   They're a little slick sometimes.   It's been a long day out there.   I was just happy to come through in the end. 

Q.   Capturing the momentum from last week, you got into this field, now with a good finish you can maybe work your way into Doral.   Your season is kind of changing right in front of you. 
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, my goal coming out here was really to‑‑ I was kind of off for a little bit being hurt, and it's just been to get to work a lot on my game and get back and get healthy and get to play as many rounds as possible.   Now I'm getting at least one more round here, so excited about that. 

Q.   After the disappointment of Sunday afternoon in LA, how important was it for you to come out and win a big match against Ernie today? 
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, I think it was.   I was down a couple early, and I really found some momentum, started to play really well for a while, got a nice lead, got a couple up, probably five, six holes to go or something, and Ernie made a couple of birdies, so I had a couple of good looks that I didn't make.   Yeah, and it got exciting down the stretch.   It was really tight all the way.   But yeah, fortunate to come through.
