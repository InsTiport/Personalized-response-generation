  Q. What a solid up-and-down round. You had seven birdies, four bogeys and the rest pars, that was a roller coaster.   
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, I missed a few short putts today. I hit a lot of great shots. It wasn't really -- I didn't get off to the best of starts, so I had a couple of bogeys the first three holes. After that I think I played really solid golf. I racked off plenty of chances and I think maybe had one 3-putt or something and made one bogey on one chip and 2-putt. Kept giving myself chances.  
  
  Q. 12 and 13 you hit it really close there, tough to make those putts; are these greens just that tough to read?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: No, they are running well. They are quick. Any time you get quick putts, they are going to break a bit more when they are quicker and you try to find the line and put it on that line.   
 Unfortunately I misread a couple, and if the pace is a little too soft, sometimes it's going to break a heck of a lot. Just try to keep hitting good putts.   
  
  Q. Nobody has played Liberty National a whole lot, no big advantage for any players; have you learned anything over the three days that will help you in the final round?  
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: I think you try to do the prep work before the weekend; it's a tough, challenging course. You have to try to put the ball in play and position yourself well. I think just what you have to keep doing. If you end up with tough pitch shots around these greens, it's going to be next to impossible for all of players, so you've got to position yourself well.
