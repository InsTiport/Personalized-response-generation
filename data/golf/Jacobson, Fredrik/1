Q. 5-under par 67 in the first round, had to like how you got around today.FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, I started off hitting I think the first 10 greens in a row.  Had a lot of chances, didn't really make a lot of putts at that point, but missed a few greens in a row on the tough holes, lost a couple of shots, but then came back strong.  Birdied three out of the last five holes or so.  So that was nice.Q. You had quite the highlight reel on the 9th hole.FREDDIE JACOBSON: The pitch shot?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a good up-and-down.  I had a little bit of green to work with, but it was kind of a thick lie over there, so I was happy to get that close.Q. Rough was really rough today?FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah.  Around here it's tough.  You got to keep it straight.  I was fortunate enough to hit most of the fairways today, so I think that's what you got to do, especially heading over tomorrow, it's going to be even more important on the course that's longer.Q. Do you like playing in these conditions where it's a little cool, a little moist in the area?FREDDIE JACOBSON: Well, I live in Florida now, I like it sunny and warm.  But most of today was sunny and warm.  It got a little chilly on the last few holes when the fog came in again.  I think the weather is beautiful, I think it's just the fog that we're dealing with on and off.
