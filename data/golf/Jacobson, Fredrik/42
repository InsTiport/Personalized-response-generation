 Q. The hole-in-one was on the par 3, 13? 
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Yeah, that was a lot of fun. There was a lot of people around that green, and funny enough, I called it out when it was in the air, as well. We were cracking up, and it had a long ways to go, but it looked good all the way.
 Dropped in. I didn't make a birdie all week on the back nine. 

 Q. What's the distance on it and the club?
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: It's 4-iron I think, 190-something, but it was into a stiff breeze.

 Q. What number hole-in-one was that?
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: Five.

 Q. How about in majors? 
 FREDRIK JACOBSON: First one in a major.
