Q.   Are you happy with some of the things in that round?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Well, I played okay in the beginning, I didn't make any putts at all really on my back nine.   And I made four or five good putts there.   Unfortunately, I missed a couple of shots and got a couple of tough lies down the last couple of holes.   But it felt good to start making a couple of putts and three birdies on that side.   So at least it's a sign I'm going in the right direction.

Q.   Do you feel like you're still right in there?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   You don't want to shoot much more than 3‑over, that's for sure, in the first round.   But it is what it is.   If you have a good round, if I can play well tomorrow and get back in the tournament, I can do a lot of good things in 36 holes.   So tomorrow is going to be a key day for me to get back in. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, I thought I hit some good drives.   I had some chances, like I said.   I think between the wedges and the putter I felt like I left three or four shots out there.   You shoot a poor round or something, 1‑under, you're right in there.   So hopefully I can be a little sharper tomorrow.
