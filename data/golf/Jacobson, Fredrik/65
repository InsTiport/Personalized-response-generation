Q.
Just talk about your round today, how you played and the course. 

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I think, first of all, the course is in very good shape.  I think it's playing good and it's dried out a little bit, as well, which is nice.  I played solid today.  I didn't make any bogeys or anything, so I made four birdies and all the rest, kept the ball in play nicely, and chipping and putting really good enough, made the putts that I had to make to stay ahead.  I was very happy with the way I felt today.


Q.  It looked like you were ahead most of the match.  Was there any turning point or anything that happened that might have helped you out throughout the match?

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I think at the beginning, the first two, three holes, we were all square, but Phillip took it by and I had to lag it up to get 1 ahead.  After that I got to 2 straightaway and then had a couple of five-footers when he had already made his two in a row.  That was important to make just before the turn to stay a couple ahead, happy to roll those in.  That felt a little bit like a key, let the gap shrink early.


Q.  And who are you going to play in the next round?

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I'm not really sure.


Q.  You haven't even looked?

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  No.


Q.  Talk about just the fact that you came all the way out here, and you get to the second round and it's not like one and out, you get to come back and play tomorrow. 

FREDRIK JACOBSON:  That's what you're hoping for.  It can be a very short week.  And if it's not your day the first day or if you don't play really well, it's nice to get in and get to the second round and hopefully get a better rhythm going.
