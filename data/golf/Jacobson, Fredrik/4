Q. A couple years ago in the U.S. Open, you played late on Sunday, you're right in the mix the whole week.  Obviously this course agrees with you.  What is it going to take to harken back on some of those memories and transfer them to today?FREDDIE JACOBSON: It's always nice to have played well at the course when you show up.  But every day it's a new day still.  You can't really benefit from it other than having some course knowledge.  You've still got to hit all the shots, and it's such a demanding course this week.  Hopefully I'll be on my game and play well.  That's the key out there.
Q. Do the knickers give you some confidence?  Good vibe for you?FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, Oscar Jacobson started making me some knickers last year and I've been wearing them on and off from time to time.  We'll see what they have got today.
Q. This golf course appears to be tough once again.  Right now the lowest score is 2-under par.  What do you think it will take for you today to be holding the trophy?FREDDIE JACOBSON: It's tough to say how the greens are today, if they have firmed up even more or if they are about the same.  But we know what it takes out there.  It's such a demanding course.  You just have to keep the ball in play and give yourself some chances and give yourself a chance to hit the greens and roll it okay.  That's what I'm going for.
