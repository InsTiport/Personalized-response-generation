 Q.   Freddie, nice way to close out the tournament.   Just get some comments on a great round.  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah.   Just hit the ball really solid right from the beginning, got three birdies in the first four holes.   Couldn't ask for a better start to get back in it.   
Yesterday was a slow day for me, shot even and just came out hitting the ball well today.   Yesterday was kind of an off day, and it was nice.   Hit a bunch of shots really tight, made those three‑, four‑, five‑footers, then the long one at the last which was nice.   
   
 Q.   A lot of birdies out there this week, so was yesterday a little bit frustrating for you?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   Yeah.   I mean obviously people weren't running away too much, apart from maybe one guy.   So I mean it was definitely an opportunity yesterday, but I'm glad I came back strong today.   
It's still kicking off the season in a decent way, and that's all you can ask for.  
   
 Q.   What was really working for you today?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON:   I think I was just solid all through.   I didn't really miss too many greens.   Then I hit quite a few shots tight.   I think that was it, and I've been rolling the ball well all week.   So yeah, just kind of solid throughout.  
   
 Q.   Perfect.   Thank you, sir.   Appreciate it.
