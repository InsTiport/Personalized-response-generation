Q.   Just your assessment of the match; another good day?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, I played pretty solid out there, made some birdies.   Yeah, there wasn't really too much going on, and I got up early, got the first couple of holes, and then‑‑

Q.   Managed to stay ahead?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, managed to stay ahead from there.   You just don't want to give it back once you have a nice cushion, and I managed to keep 2‑, 3‑up all the way and won a couple of holes in there to close it off.

Q.   You're going along quite nicely, aren't you?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, it's been a good start.   I'm excited about getting to tee it up again tomorrow.   Every match is tough out there.   You're just happy to sneak by and try to get through one at a time.   But really excited to be in the third round. 

Q.   You're playing good; the last few weeks you're showing some great form.   You must be pretty confident. 
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, I feel good about my game.   I'm missing some shots here and there and missing a couple of putts here and there, but I'm putting a lot of work in, so that's really what I've focused on for a long time here.   Had a big two, three‑hour putting session in the hotel room last night, and I'm going to go now and have a hitting session after this, just grab some food, get some nutrition and go at it.

Q.   What was the speed of that hotel room carpet?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:   Yeah, it was pretty good, pretty good.
