THE MODERATOR:  Fredrik, thanks for joining us.  First round 66.  Matt Gogel set the course record this morning, but you're not too far behind him.  Three off the lead.  Good day for you.  If you could start with some opening comments.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, thank you very much.  I was delighted to get off to a good start.  I actually felt quite tired after Monday's qualifying, 37 holes in a day there after a few long weeks.  After a bit of rest, it was nice to come out and play well again.
THE MODERATOR:  Just looking at your round, you started on the backside, were even after nine holes, then birdied five out of six at one point.  Maybe talk about that a little bit.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, I really gave myself a lot of chances all the way around.  I didn't make as many on my first 9, the Back 9.  Missed like four putts inside 10 feet, lost a few chances there.  It was really nice around the turn to bring a few home with me on the way back.  To bring a good score in felt good.  I only missed a couple of fairways and a couple of greens today.  Got to try to take advantage of that.
THE MODERATOR:  Speaking of the greens, Jim Furyk earlier said he probably missed eight putts inside 15 feet that had two, three feet of break on it.  Talk about the greens and how difficult they are.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, I didn't get too many of them big swingers.  Of course, a lot of them were either coming downhill or up the hill.  I had a few left to right putts on the first nine going downhill a bit.  They were tough.  I didn't make any of those.  But then on the second nine, I managed to get a bit better lines on them and started to get a better feel for the greens as well.  That helped me.
THE MODERATOR:  Questions.
Q.  Was your qualifying at Woodmont for US Open?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I was down in Ohio.
Q.  How did you do?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I missed by one shoot.  Had a playoff for an alternate spot.  I managed to get the second alternate.  No US Open this year.
Q.  Seems like one of the stories today is that this course, while it's regarded as a US Open quality venue, is not playing as hard as maybe a US Open course would.  It's playing a bit easier and softer for you guys.  Does that seem to be the case?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah.  I mean, it's very soft.  It doesn't run a lot over the fairways.  It certainly doesn't run a lot on the greens at the moment.  Pretty much whatever club you're hitting in, it stops right away.  That makes a huge difference compared to US Open, if they manage to dry it out, especially to get close to these pins.  If it has firmed up, hopefully the weather will take care of that over the next few days.
Q.  That is a possibility there, the course firming up?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Well, I don't know if it's going to get that firm.  But I look for it to get a little bit firmer.  It would be nice.

It is easier to play this way.  But if you're trying to play the course the way they wanted it set up, I think.
Q.  We have so many big names here, Vijay, Phil, so forth.  You think of looking up at the leaderboard, Ken with a course record, you in second place.  Few people would have predicted that day.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  First day.  Take another look on Sunday.
THE MODERATOR:  One bogey on the day.  Start on the backside, 15, par 5, made your first birdie.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah.  Laid it up for a wedge, hit it up to 15 feet, made that.
THE MODERATOR:  Only bogey of the day, 18.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, I missed the green to the right and then pitched it 10 feet by the hole.
THE MODERATOR:  What did you hit off the tee there?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  8 iron.
THE MODERATOR:  It was playing a little shorter today.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, pin was short.  I think it was 174 to the flag or something.
THE MODERATOR:  Birdied five of the first six on the front side, starting with the first.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, I hit a 54 degree wedge to three feet.
THE MODERATOR:  No. 2, par 3?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Well, I 2 putted for my par.
THE MODERATOR:  Then 3?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I was in the trees on the left there.  Hit a good 6 iron under some branches, made a 20 footer.
THE MODERATOR:  And then I think you birdied 4, 5 and 6.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah.  4 I hit a 9 iron to four feet.  Made that.
THE MODERATOR:  5?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  5, I hit a little wedge into 14 feet.
THE MODERATOR:  And then the par 5, 6.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Hit a 3 iron on the second shot to the left fringe.  It was like 12 yards from the pin.  Putted that down to four or five feet.
THE MODERATOR:  Anything going into tomorrow?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Just get some good sleep.  I've been up at 5 for four days in a row, so I'm looking forward to a late start.
THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
