JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   Fredrik, thanks for joining us, not the way you wanted to finish today but still not a 69 and just one shot out of the lead.  Fred Couples birdied his last hole and has a one-stroke lead.  Overall a great two days from you so far.  Let's start with some opening comments.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  It was great to get into today's round for a while because I felt in the beginning that I wasn't really getting anything going on the front nine until the 9th hole.  I started off solid but made a couple of bogeys and hit a couple of great shots on the 9th so at least give myself a chance for an eagle and I got the birdie to at least get to level par.

Playing the front nine last, if you play well, you're going to get some opportunities on that nine, and that's what happened.  I came to the second hole, and since I hadn't made any putts I was given a wedge into the cup, so that kind of got my round going a bit.  I kept playing well from there on until the last hole.
Q.
What happened on that last hole?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I don't know.  I mean, it's -- I hit a bad tee shot first of all and got really lucky.  It could have been 9 really (laughter).  The second shot I was in trouble, as well.  I was given a chance to get myself out and play again.  You're standing around for 10, 15 minutes on the tee box.  I don't know if I might have lost a bit of rhythm.  I put a couple of bad swings, was in between clubs and chose to play a smooth 8-iron on the third shot and just leaked out a little bit, and then there was a couple of tough lies and obviously didn't make the putt for 6, which would have been better, but at the same time tried my hardest.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   Did you punch out there on your second shot.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Yeah, I couldn't get there with a 7-iron.
Q.
How close were you to being out of bounds or was that a factor at all?  Were you close to the --
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Is there out of bounds on that?
Q.
I guess if you go further out it could be unplayable or something like that.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  There was a lot of trees.  It must have hit one of the trees.  It was right on the outside line of the tree line and must have kicked on the outside of them and bounced back in right.  When you get a good break -- it was the right situation for me to get a good break when I needed it and could bring the lead in, and it was just disappointing to not take that advantage and at least make a par or give yourself a putt for a 4 there.
Q.
Does that stay with you tonight or do you just forget about it coming out tomorrow?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Of course I'm going to be a little bit disappointed now, but as I tee up tomorrow, I'll still realize that I'm in a great position.  I'm in position where if I play well tomorrow I can win the tournament on Sunday, so I wouldn't let myself down and not give myself the best possible chance to try to do just that in the weekend.
Q.
What was your yardage in when you holed out from the fairway?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  It was 112.
Q.
And the club there?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  54-degree wedge.
Q.
It felt good right off --
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  That one felt great.  I mean, you can't tell whether it's going to go in or not, but I had a couple of others that have been really close this week, as well.  The wedges are still being phenomenal from the fairway when I have been laying up.  That was the key yesterday.  I almost made one and I almost had another one on the par 5 using the slope there.  I hope I can keep hitting the wedge like that.  That can keep producing a lot of chances.
Q.
What makes you such a good wedge player?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  Me and Richard, my coach, and I have been working on this last week.  I enjoy the short game a lot but try to work on different yardages and do it regularly for five days in a row where we just mix the yardages and play different shots all the time and try to play some level ones that can be used for the back pins so you can bounce it up a little bit.  That's where we've been putting in a lot of work last week, and maybe you don't expect results that quickly, but I've been feeling comfortable these last two days.  I hope it stays for the rest of the week.
Q.
Not to dwell on the double, but since it was the last hole do you think it's more magnified than it should be since the last one was the situation that it was?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  It's always tougher if you don't have any holes to come back afterwards.  I did make a good putt early in the day for a 5 on one par 4 which is not one of the tougher ones, either, where I made the 12-footer for a bogey.  After that I obviously came back.  That one is gone in your memory, but the last one you bring to the locker room, or at least you walk off with it.  You're not playing anymore, so that's the last memory of the day.
Q.
Do you think the pressure of the situation had anything to do with the way that hole went?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I don't think so.  I've been playing big tournaments and been up there a lot.  I mean, of course you want to do well, but I wanted to do well on the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, as well, and there's still a long way to go in the tournament.  I mean, it's a different thing coming down the 72nd hole.  I don't think the -- the 36th hole is nice if you can bring in the lead, but the tournament is not going to be -- I couldn't win the tournament on that hole and I probably couldn't lose it, either, hopefully (laughter).
Q.
Are you even looking at the scoreboard at that point?  You know you're playing well; are you checking out who's behind you?  It's just the second round.
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I mean, you put a glimpse every now and then.  I normally take a little peek at the leaderboard.  I've done that this week from day one like all the other weeks that you're standing around and waiting.  There's been a bit of waiting these two days, and then it ends up in your eye line or something.  It's almost harder work trying to look away every time you see a leaderboard than it is to look at it.
Q.
How does Jesper manage to do that then?
FREDRIK JACOBSON:  I don't know.  You'll have to ask him that.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   Fredrik, thank you.
