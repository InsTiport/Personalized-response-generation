 Q.  All right, talk me through it.  What was this last round like?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Starting off, we're really good friends with Ashley and Caroline, so actually never played such good friends in match play.  Definitely an adjustment.   
They are really good players.  We all started off kind of slow and then we got it going down the stretch and got pretty intense.  Caroline made a putt on 18 and then I made a putt on 19.  It was just -- went by like that I guess.   
 Q.  It was definitely a roller coaster.  What were your feelings when they made that putt on 18?  
MEGAN FURTNEY: I was expecting it.  I think that's kind of what you have to do in match play, is you have to expect your opponent to always play the best and make every putt they have.   
So I was expecting that, and so I was just ready to go.  I know Erica was too.  We were just ready to go.  Hit the next tee shot and just take it from there.   
 Q.  What was your energy level like this afternoon?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: I think we both do a pretty good job of staying in shape, so I know I'm feeling all right.  I could probably go play another nine; I don't know about 18.   
But I think we just need to recover and get ready for tomorrow, and I think we're in good shape.
