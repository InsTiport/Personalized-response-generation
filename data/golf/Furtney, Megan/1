Q. It was a very back and forth match early.  1-down quickly, but then 1-up, all square.  Kind of took control on 7 and 8 with the birdies; is that correct?
ERICA SHEPHERD: It was 8 and 9, yeah.  Amari made a birdie on No. 7., and then we birdied 8 and 9.
Q. And just what can you say about the match itself?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, early every hole was back and forth, and then I think 8 and 9, those were?  Our two best holes.  We both had good looks at birdies on both holes, and we alternated who made the putts.
Then back nine I think which just took advantage when we could.  And Megan, I've never seen her play so solid, so it was a good day.  Hopefully we can carry that over to the next round.
Q. On 8 and 9, you each made one.  Who made...
MEGAN FURTNEY: I made 8, she made 9.
Q. And how long?
MEGAN FURTNEY: Mine was like 20, and her's was like a...
ERICA SHEPHERD: Six-footer, seven-footer.  It was downhill slider.
Q. Okay.  So when you get up two does it give you a little more freedom?
MEGAN FURTNEY: It's definitely nice too because you know when you play against girls as good as Alexa and Amari, like they can make birdies at any given time.  If you get a couple holes under your belt it's definitely something you really want to have going into the back nine.
We were able to kind of pick that up, which helps a lot.
Q. Excellent.  And then put it away, again, just trying to keep two balls in play as much as you can.  Is that an important consideration out here?
ERICA SHEPHERD: All the same routine as we did first round of stroke play.  Nothing has changed.  Even though it's a bigger stage and it's match play, we judge kept everything the same.
