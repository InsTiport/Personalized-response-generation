 Q.  He threw a real haymaker at you but you withstood it. What?s that say about you?  
BEAU HOSSLER: I had this weird feeling on 17 that he was going to make that for some reason. That?s how things have been going this whole week. Everything had been going their way, from start to finish. This morning Denny (McCarthy) and I played great and we just could not catch a break and they couldn?t catch a bad break. That?s just how golf is sometimes unfortunately. I think I am pretty resilient. I tried to get one down the fairway (on 18) and just pushed it a little. Fortunately I finally caught a good lie over there in the trampled stuff and was able to get some spin on it. Seeing a 3-up lead diminish in four holes and really only playing one poor hole was a little disappointing.   
 Q.  This is a team event but you had three points this weekend. How do you assess your play?  
BEAU HOSSLER: I think I played well. I proved to myself that my game can travel over here and I can be successful. I had never been overseas (Europe) but I have been to Japan but that golf is kind of the same as we play in America. To be able to play links golf and to play in some weather, even though in didn?t rain much. It was windy pretty much the whole time but I was able to flight my ball down and putt well in the wind. I am confident over here now. I would love to get over and play a British Amateur or something like that where it?s stroke play and I am truly playing an individual tournament because this week was all about the team. I really enjoyed my stay here (Royal Lytham & St. Annes), Royal Liverpool and Hillside too. Those are all three great links courses.
