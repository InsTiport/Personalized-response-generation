Q. Two courses are drastically different.  Do you remember making that comment?BEAU HOSSLER: I don't remember the comment.  I remember the course, though.  It's an awesome track.  I think they have a college regional there still.  It's an awesome track.  I've never talked to anybody that didn't like it.  It's really fun and kind of like this course, you can get pretty creative around the greens, it seems like.Q. You qualified for three Opens as an amateur.  The only other guy to do that as an amateur is Nicklaus?BEAU HOSSLER: Any time you are in company with Jack Nicklaus, I guess you are doing something right.  Obviously it's nice making it here, but I'm trying to contend.  That's the goal.  Obviously I've proven to myself that I can qualify for the event, but I think it's time I start making a move towards the lead a little bit.Q. It looks like you are probably going to make the cut?BEAU HOSSLER: Hopefully I'm right in there.Q. You were really covering today?BEAU HOSSLER: It was a really extremely stressful round.  I'm pretty tired right now.  It was one of those deals like you are scrambling everywhere. Yesterday I hit 16 greens, today I maybe hit 10.Q. I think you led the field in greens in regulation?BEAU HOSSLER: Did I?  Wow, that's really encouraging to shoot over par with that.  Just really haven't gotten the speed or lines on the putts. Today I got a couple to drop, but even so I need to do some work.  My speed is off.  I've just got to work on my stroke a little bit.
