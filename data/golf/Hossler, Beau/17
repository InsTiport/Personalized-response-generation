Q. You got a really important point at a big time on Saturday afternoon.
BEAU HOSSLER: ?We really needed that point. I?m not sure how it stands but it?s relatively close. I was 3-down with eight to go and I told my caddie that I had to stick to my game plan. It?s a really hard golf course and anything can happen when it?s this difficult and windy and cold. I?ve been rolling the ball well and I got a few to drop. Hats off to my opponent he played well.
Q. How do you keep yourself calm in that high pressure situation when you desperately want that point?
BEAU HOSSLER: ?You have to feel like you don?t want it as bad as you do. If you put that kind of pressure you can?t really perform. I felt calm on 18 and on 17. Jack played great. He lipped out two bunker shots in the last three holes.
