Q. You won the only point of the morning for the USA. What is your general assessment of the match?
BEAU HOSSLER: We knew the momentum was with GB&I. Denny and I really struck the ball well today in the wind. We hit a lot of the greens that you normally wouldn?t hit in the wind. We kept the ball in play and stayed out of any fairway bunkers. That was the game plan the last four days because it?s pretty much a one-stroke penalty.?
Q. 3-wood on the second hole was probably the shot of the match because it gave you the first win of the match?
BEAU HOSSLER: Any kind of early cushion is always nice. Especially on a course like this where one bad swing is going to cost you the hole. Denny drove it left and into some kind of fairway strip near the 16th tee. We had 220 into the wind and it was playing like 250 and I hit a really good 3-wood into the green.
