 Q.  Take me through your thoughts on this match.  
SAMMI LEE: This one was tough.  We didn't really make a long putt all day --   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Until 17.   
SAMMI LEE: But we had kind of been doing that in earlier matches, kept us going, but we didn't really -- we didn't convert a lot of birdies.  It was close all the way up to the end.  Yeah, I tried to lag it down there, and it went in.   
 Q.  This was the winning putt?  
SAMMI LEE: Yeah, on 17.   
 Q.  How long was it?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Just off the green.   
SAMMI LEE: Yeah, just off the fringe, probably 25 --   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Yeah, 25, 30 feet.   
 Q.  Take me through the other holes that you won, any details that you recall.  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: It was really back and forth.   
SAMMI LEE: We got down a little.   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: And just stayed patient, tried to make some putts.   
SAMMI LEE: Tried to build some momentum.   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Just give both of us an opportunity to have a putt for birdie and kind of feed off that.   
 Q.  What's the grind like of playing double-round days in a USGA event where the courses are tough, the heat?  How tough is that?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: It's definitely tough.  I wouldn't say it's a walk in the park, but it's fun and it's exciting, and the good thing about it is having team match play, once you're out of a hole, you get a second to kind of catch your breath, refresh, refocus, hopefully while your partner has got your back.  But yeah, it's definitely a grind.  It's 36, and it's a lot of focus, but it's been a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Is this the furthest you guys have been in a USGA event before?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: This is both of our first.   
 Q.  This is your first event, period?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Yeah.   
 Q.  These things aren't easy, obviously, and you're one good day away from winning the thing.  
SAMMI LEE: Yeah, it's been fun, kind of approaching it like a normal golf tournament.  But the pins and everything, they're tough, and they made the course tough.  Like we said, staying patient and knowing that the opportunities are there, that it's set up to give you some chances, and you've just got to keep grinding.   
 Q.  That's kind of a theme of these events, usually you get later on, you really have to grind to win.  Everybody is tired.  It's hard to stick with it.  Is that the style of golf you like to play?  
SAMMI LEE: I mean, yeah, you're grinding but you're also just trying to enjoy it, not take it too, too seriously, but just --   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: We're having fun, which helps.  If we hit a bad shot, then we just would have laughed it off and gone to the next one.   
SAMMI LEE: This is basically both of our last, like, tournaments because we're both done with college golf, so I think -- I mean, regardless from here on out, it's grinding, but it's just soaking it all in.  We've ended it on a really high note.   
 Q.  You're representing for the SEC, too, Florida is out, Kentucky is out earlier today, Bailey is out, so now you're the last dog standing.  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Yeah, and I think we might have an SEC showdown tomorrow.  Don't we have the LSU girls?   
 Q.  Oh, yes you do.  
SAMMI LEE: LS who?   
 Q.  Do you know them at all?  One of them is still in high school.  
SAMMI LEE: Yeah, I know of them.  The college golf world is really small.  I've just never played with them.   
 Q.  What do you have to do to win tomorrow?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Keeping patient, keep doing the same thing we're doing, give ourselves opportunities, and putts will fall.   
SAMMI LEE: Yeah.
