 Q.  Overall impressions of the match?  What are your initial thoughts moving onto the quarterfinals?  
SAMMI LEE: Thanks, mom, for carrying me; that's my initial thought.   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: No, we were back and forth again.  I think we did a good job just picking each other up just like we did yesterday, which is all you can ask for in this format, and if we just keep playing steady, keep giving ourselves opportunities, hopefully we'll have some putts fall this afternoon, as well.   
 Q.  Are you used to playing double-round days?  How much of a challenge is it?  
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Yeah, we've just got to make sure we keep our momentum.   
SAMMI LEE: Make sure you eat lunch, get hydrated, I think take a moment now and then we'll go have a short warm-up again and get back out there.   
 Q.  Any moments from that match that stand out, any big shots or anything?  
SAMMI LEE: I think getting the birdie on 15 was huge, just to secure the dormie.  That kind of is a relief that that's --   
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: Yeah, it made 16 a little easier, just hit it in there and give ourselves an opportunity.  If we make birdie, great; if we make par, then force them to make a birdie.
