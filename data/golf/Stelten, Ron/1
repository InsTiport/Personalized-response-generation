  Q.  How far was it and what did you hit?   
 RON STELTEN:  I had somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 yards and I hit a 2-iron.  Just faded it to the middle of the green, knowing that it was going to drift to the right, and it drifted in just the right way and landed in just the right spot.   
 And a long time went by before they started clapping.  But it must have just taken its time getting to the hole, but sure enough, there it was, actually in the hole.   
  
  Q.  Did you actually see it go in?   
 RON STELTEN:  No, you can't see it.  I mean it -- you know, because the guys in front of us had had a problem in the hole and we had had to wait.   
 And so the group behind us was on the tee with us also.  And so all the good shots were already over.  Everybody said, "good shot, good shot, good shot".  R.W. Eaks said, "good shot" and then the next thing you know, it goes in the hole.  So that was pretty cool.   
  
  Q.  Something you'll remember forever?   
 RON STELTEN:  You know, oh, of course, yeah.  Because all the congratulations going up the fairway, that was really, really cool.  I did make a hole-in-one on the European TOUR in front of 25,000 people one time.  That was really, really cool.  But this is the second best.  This one might even mean a little bit more too.   
  
  Q.  And your experiences for the week similar?   
 RON STELTEN:  I've had a good week.  I played a lot of solid golf this week.  And I kept the big numbers to a minimum and so you know, it's still, you know, in the great scheme of things, it's a middle of the pack finish.   
 I wish I had played a little bit better, but at the same time I had a good tournament.  I have to say that I had a really good tournament.
