Q.   Siddikur, how good was this victory? 
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Really it was great, a great round out of all those three rounds.   Today was my great play.   I played like 3‑under and I had a really memorable shot.   Overall it was really great for hitting and my putting was super.   I played well to win this match. 
I can see that we are ahead so I think we have a good chance to win this match.

Q.   What was the turning point for you in this game? 
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   It was like on hole No. 12, I chipped in, so then I was at 3 up, so I think that's my turning point, and I got back‑to‑back birdies,11 and 12, so it was a good turning point for me.

Q.   The first day you never gave up and showed the true fighting spirit for Team Asia. 
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   It was a really good experience.   You know, like our team captain, we did a meeting after the round every day, so I think that the first day unfortunately we lost but we didn't give up. 
But personally, I had really good confidence that it's like our home course for all Asia players, so really I had a good confidence and I think we did really good the last two rounds.
