 Q.   Siddikur, just talk about today's round, are you happy with how you played?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   Well, I think our hitting was good, except we couldn't hold a putt.   Everything was okay, on the line.   They got a few good‑‑ like two very long putt, but we played a great game.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about which was the decisive hole out there for you today?   Which were the important holes?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   I think hole No. 11, the eagle, we had a chance and that one was in the water.   We were in good position, and second shot I was just short of the green so we had a chance.   But it's okay, it's a part of the game.  
   
 Q.   Looking at the scoreboard now, how will you rally spirits backup?   
SIDDIKUR RAHMAN:   I would say it's only the first day, nothing to worry, two days to go.   The third day will be very good competition and tomorrow, as well, because tomorrow is foursome.   So really looking forward to the next two days.
