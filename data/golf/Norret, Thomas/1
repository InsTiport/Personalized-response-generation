 Q.   Tell us about the story of the day?  
THOMAS NÃRRET:   Well, the story of the day is that I played pretty much flawless golf for most of the day in very tough conditions.   I was very pleased with myself and a lot of good shots, didn't make hardly any mistakes until I got to my 17th hole and hit a wayward tee shot.   
Obviously the last hole is a tough hole, and I drove it in the rough and I couldn't reach.   Obviously it's disappointing to finish double‑bogey, bogey, but really, I had a lot of good things today and I'm happy for that.   And the tournament is not over yet, either.   
   
 Q.   If we concentrate on those positives, you're 6‑under, and as you say, the wind is very tricky out there.   
THOMAS NÃRRET:   Yeah, Mick helped me a lot, kept me very calm.   He's been out here for years, and we just kind of went around and had a lot of fun and trusted the swing all day.   One not trusting swing was on the 17th, or the 8th, and that's it.   But other than that, I was really pleased and hit in a lot of good spots and made some good putts.  
   
 Q.   And it is only the second round but were you conscious of your position on the leaderboard at the time?   
THOMAS NÃRRET:   It's hard not to be obviously.   I admit I haven't been in this situation for a while, but obviously I felt it a little bit, even though it's only Friday.   Yeah, that's how it is, I just have to learn to cope with that.  
   
 Q.   It did affect you when you were standing on the 17th?  
THOMAS NÃRRET:   Not prior to the shot obviously.   I knew where I was and I knew the situation, but I just didn't‑‑ I didn't manage to commit as well as I did in the rest of it.   
I'm happy where I am and I'm really happy the game is going in the right direction.   It's been really bad, and really looking forward for a turnaround, and this looks like it's coming.   
   
 Q.   We said as much on day one, it's been an awful long time since you've been in this position?  
THOMAS NÃRRET:   Yeah, since last year back in October, and it's nice to be here again.
