  Q. Did you start on 13?
 LINN GRANT:   I did, yes, on 13th green.
 Q. On the 13th tee?
 LINN GRANT:   No, the green.
 Q. What did you have?
 LINN GRANT:   I had a downhill right to left putt, pretty speedy.
 Q. How far?
 LINN GRANT:   Probably, I would say like 11, 12 yards.
 Q. Talk about starting with the putt versus off the tee box?
 LINN GRANT:   I was actually practicing a couple of downhill putts before I went out.  I knew it was going to be fast, and I knew that they just cut the green.  So it's a little shaky, I think, to start.  If you hit a drive, you can always just get the adrenaline out of your body and hit it.  So a little uncomfortable, but it was fine.
 Q. What are you most pleased with?
 LINN GRANT:   I'm pleased that I kind of kept my calm the whole round.  I tried to not play against the course, but rather with the course, and I feel like I did a good job with that.
 Q. You feel good with all pars and then finish up with a birdie?
 LINN GRANT:   Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't really a roller coaster out there.  It was pretty solid.  A couple putts that was very close to go in and a couple pars that was saved.  So it was a mix anyways.
 Q. I imagine looking at where you stood heading into this morning, was it to get as many pars as you could and just get out of here and go rest a little bit?  What did you try to accomplish?
 LINN GRANT:   I tried to see this course as really tough.  I don't expect to make a lot of birdies.  I try to just be calm and respect and accept whatever I get and just try to get on with it sort of.  I felt that I did a good job with that.
 Q. Besides the 30 degree temperature difference, how much different did the golf course play this morning?
 LINN GRANT:   It was a little bit softer.  So the drives didn't really roll out as much.  Also, the greens wasn't as hard, so the ball kind of stopped where it landed.  So it's a give and take, I feel like.
 Q. I have to imagine you felt pretty confident coming into this week, just based on your recent play.  What have you seen over these past couple of months that's helped your play?
 LINN GRANT:   I just feel like I kind of accepted my game instead of like working -- still working on it a lot in different categories of it, but kind of playing more with what I have for the day and kind of making the best out of it.  I mean, I know I'm going to wake up some days and not feel 100 percent, and I feel like I still should be able to go out and play a good round.  So that's kind of what I've been working on a lot.
 Q. How did you come to that conclusion?
 LINN GRANT:   Just that I know I'm going to be on [LPGA] Tour, and I'm going to have days where it's not going to be great.  So I just kind of are have to learn to accept that and learn to play with whatever I have that day instead of working against it and trying to force anything else.
 Q. When exactly was this that you had this realization?  In the last couple months?  In the last year?  When did you realize this was the way it was going to have to be?
 LINN GRANT:   I think I realized it probably in like 2016, but then I just -- you know, you have to work on it all the time, and I feel like that's kind of when I -- I kind of learned to know more thing sort of, what state on the golf course that I feel most comfortable with or what I like to do before.  I feel like I kind of built that over the years a little bit.
 Q. Knowing that this is kind of a setup day for Saturday, will you look at all of the leader boards today and just kind of understanding your position, or were you just going to kind of put your head down?
 LINN GRANT:   I would just try to go out this afternoon and do the same that I did and kind of just have the same -- kind of go with the round.  Just go out and keep calm and still make a lot of pars, and if the birdies drop, they drop, and not focus too much on my score.
