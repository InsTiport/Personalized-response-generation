Q. This is your first Women's Open experience.  It was an odd start to the week for a Women's Open, but obviously didn't seem to upset you at all.  Talk about how much practice you got heading into the first round and then how you settled in so quickly.
LINN GRANT: Well, I just kind of accepted the weather and practiced the time I got to practice.  Got the hours I needed and then just focused on what I could do to get a good score and that's pretty much what I did.
Q. When did you come in and how many holes did you get in for practice?
LINN GRANT: I played 18 on Sunday, and then the first nine on Monday and then I walked the back nine on Wednesday.
Q. You said you had focused on what you had to do, what was that?
LINN GRANT: Well, just get probably the putting, the speed on the greens and then also some short game shots, pretty much.
Q. Looking at the scoreboard, did you get to 5 on the 10th hole, 5-under?
LINN GRANT: Yes.
Q. Did you make an eagle there?
LINN GRANT: On 10?
Q. On 10.
LINN GRANT: No.  I birdied.  Birdied 9 and 10.
Q. Take us through 5.
LINN GRANT: Well, I just made eight pars to start with and then I made a birdie on 9 and then a birdie on 10.
Q. How did you accomplish those birdies?
LINN GRANT: On 9, I hit it pretty close, like five yards, holed the putt.
On 10, I holed a longer putt.  Yeah.
Q. Did you know Pernilla and was there anything particularly inspiring about watching her in the first major of the year?
LINN GRANT: I don't know her.  She's Swedish, so I met her a couple of times.  Well, it's inspiring because I get to meet her and just to know her, kind of to see that she can do it, it's inspiring.
Q. Who is with you this week?
LINN GRANT: My parents.
Q. Who taught you the game?  Your grandfather was a good player.
LINN GRANT: Well, he died when I was very young.  So my dad has taught me a lot.
Q. How old were you when he died?
LINN GRANT: Six.
Q. What were your expectations coming here?  Did you come here expecting to contend?
LINN GRANT: I'm sorry?
Q. Did you come here expecting to contend?
LINN GRANT: Yeah.  I wanted to see how the other players play and to compare my own game to theirs.  And today was a tougher day for me, but I feel like I can get some good scores to end with.
Q. What would you say is like your top achievement in golf?  What is the thing that you are most proud of?
LINN GRANT: To get here, probably.
Q. Is it?
LINN GRANT: Yeah.
Q. Is this your first major?
LINN GRANT: Yeah.
Q. You didn't play the British or anything?
LINN GRANT: No.
Q. Have you been battling nerves at all?
LINN GRANT: Today?
Q. In general.
LINN GRANT: In general, no.  I expected to be a lot more nervous than I am and was.  I'm actually fine.
