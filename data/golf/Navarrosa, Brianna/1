Q. Well done.
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Thank you.
Q. How tough was this match today?
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: It was tough not only because she was a great player, she was also a great friend.  I've known her for like eight years, even more.  We were both going -- it was like a rally.  I started off good, but then she came back on the back nine and had to go back up again.  It was a tough match, probably the toughest I've played so far.
Q. It's even tougher when you have to play your friend, isn't it?
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah, it is.  It's just hard because I've known her for so long, I've played with her in so many tournaments that it would even be an honor losing to her as a friend.
Q. What did you do well today?
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I think I just played -- stayed mostly in the fairways.  I kind of stressed out on the back nine just because she came back more.  But I was putting well today.  I made the putts that I needed to.  I hit the shots that I needed to.  I could hit better drives, but it was a good day.
Q. So you're moving on through the tournament; what do you need to do to keep going?
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I think I need to stick my shots closer because I know my competitor is even better than Brooke, so I'm going to have to putt well and stick them close.
