  Q. How excited are you to be here?
 BRIANNA NAVARROSA:   I'm super excited.  It's my first time here.  I've been waiting two years to be here and it's such an honor to be out here.  It's beautiful.  It's very different from L.A., but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
 Q. What are your expectations and goals for this week?
 BRIANNA NAVARROSA:   I definitely want to make it to Augusta and obviously my top goal is to win it but I'm just honored to be out here.  I'm just happy to be here.
 Q. What are you most looking forward to?
 BRIANNA NAVARROSA:   Probably just like everyone else, playing Augusta.  That's been my lifelong dream and seeing everybody play out there, all my idols, and now finally I get to play there.
 Q. Talk about this evening and going to the Chairman's Dinner and driving down Magnolia Lane?
 BRIANNA NAVARROSA:   You just see on TV, you see the road and stuff.  I feel when I'm actually there, it's going to be a totally different feeling.  I might even cry, I don't even know, because I've grown up watching all my heroes play that, so to finally be here is such a dream come true.  Even stepping foot on Augusta National, like, grass, is going to be amazing.
 Q. Talk about the course today.  What are your first impressions?
 BRIANNA NAVARROSA:   It's definitely on the longer side for me just because I'm a little short and stuff.  But I really like the way the greens are rolling and it's just like home, really fast, and because like one of my advantages is my short game, I think it could be really good for me.  Even though it's a little long, I know I'm going to be all right.
