   MARIE-LAURE DE LORENZI:  On the first one, you know, the Americans did very well and they were always up, so I think for us to half the match was a very good advantage, was very positive.   
  
  Q.  This is a pretty big with the Norwegian and Swede playing close to home with a little hometown crowd following them.  Is it important to get the fans excited?   
 MARIE-LAURE DE LORENZI:  Yes, I think so.  But I think that people here, they love to play golf, and they are very fair play and very exciting and in general fun to watch the girls play good golf.  Of course, they are a little bit more from Europe, but they even try to see all the ladies and such high level, you know.   
  
  Q.  This is an exciting time for the European team to get going here in the morning round.   
 MARIE-LAURE DE LORENZI:  Yes, I think.  The weather is not so good, but it's the same for everybody, and I think, you know, they are trying very hard to -- to make the best of the game, and I think it's -- we saw a lot of good shots, and I think it's high level, so it's fantastic.
