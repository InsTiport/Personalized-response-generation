 Q.  It looks like you got off to a really good start.  Can you talk about that a little bit?  VANESSA HA: I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, I think I had a few birdies to begin with, and that was mainly because I was just focusing on keeping my emotions under control, and I was focusing mostly on my mental game, and that's, like, the biggest indicator for my putting.   Q.  You mentioned your mental game, your putting.  What part were you most pleased with overall?  VANESSA HA: Probably putting, yeah.  I made quite a few birdies, like quite a few, and I was just pretty pleased with that.  But the key was that I wasn't focusing on trying to make the birdies.  They just went in.   Q.  Has your game been different today than it was the last two days or similar?  VANESSA HA: Yes, it's been different.  It's been a lot better because I've just been -- I've taken in the previous rounds and just analyzed my mental game, the mental aspect, and that was the biggest change, and so I played better today than the previous rounds.   Q.  Do you prefer match play or stroke play overall?  VANESSA HA: I don't.  I don't think I've had enough experience with match play to know which one I prefer.   Q.  Are you going to take the same mindset tomorrow, or how are you going to approach tomorrow?  VANESSA HA: The same mindset, definitely, just not trying too hard and not focusing too hard on the outcome.
