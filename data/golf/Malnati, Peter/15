Q. First time at this event.  Just overall thoughts on the venue, the course, obviously you played pretty well.
PETER MALNATI: It's an amazing place.  It's one of those places where it's important to get here early so you can get used to looking out there so when the tournament starts you remember to focus on the golf, because it's a really cool place.
Q. Safe to say returning here in 2017 is on the list of goals?
PETER MALNATI: Absolutely it's on the goals.  I'm actually -- I'll leave here disappointed that I didn't get it done this week.  Every week that goes by is just more pressure to make sure that I get back here.
