Q. You certainly had an interesting wind today for your group.  Seemed windy at times and not windy at times.  Talk about the difficulty and challenges that posed.
PETER MALNATI: I mean, it was never terribly windy.  I think here we expect it to blow, so whatever wind we did have we today was never anything more than what we would've anticipated.
Yeah, definitely got calm towards the end of the day.  Yeah, that was nice.
Q. Your round, would up and down be a fair description of it?
PETER MALNATI: I didn't like starting with a bogey and I didn't like ending with bogey, but in between I was really happy.  I hit a lot of good shots in between.
So I felt really good about that, yeah.
Q. After your win at Sanderson Farms, you mentioned you'd really like to play a round and spend some time with the guy over your shoulder here, Zach Johnson.  What was it like playing a round with him today?
PETER MALNATI: He's pretty cool dude, so it was actually easy.  But, yeah, when the pairings came out i was really excited about it.  Yeah, he's I've watched for years do the thing that I'm going to have to do if I want to be successful out here:  Play my game, wedge it close, putt well, and not try to do things that other people are doing.
Just take care of my business.  I've watched him for years just doing it on TV.  He's someone I've really looked up to.
So to get to play with him is pretty cool.
Q. And seeing it up close, I know you don't want to share any secrets, but did you pick up anything today?
ZACK JOHNSON: Enough of the awkwardness.
PETER MALNATI: (Laughter.)  He's right.  You know, I was out there just trying to take care of business.  I'm trying to beat him right now.  I think I definitely will -- I hope over the years to learn a lot from him.  Right now when we're playing side by side, just going to try to beat him.
