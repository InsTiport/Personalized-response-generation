Q. Peter, little different trip today than yesterday but still a red number.  You got to feel good about it.
PETER MALNATI: I really do feel good about it.  Yesterday I looked out there and hit all the fairways yesterday and today I probably hit half of them and had a stroke and distance penalty two 3-putts today and still got it around under par.  Feel good about that.
Q. Do you feel that you threw some away because you didn't strike it like yesterday?
PETER MALNATI: I still threw away shots outside of the tee shots.  Didn't putt very well for me.  Made a couple nice putts.  I missed some I would expect to make.  All in all, I'm really happy with the score for sure.  It certainly could have been better but, you know, it could always be worse, too.
Q. Seems like the course is in pretty good shape, conditions benign, good scoring opportunities.
PETER MALNATI: No doubt.  This morning the greens were so pure and in such good shape.  Feel like you can make everything you look at.  The greens are -- they're that good.  Definitely some low ones out there.  Yeah, I mean the course is in perfect shape.  It's fun to play.
Q. Good start.  Good luck this week.
PETER MALNATI: Thanks.  Appreciate it.
