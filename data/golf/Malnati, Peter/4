Q. Peter, another good week.  Get some comments.
PETER MALNATI:   Yeah, it's fun to play well.  I mean, yeah, I've played -- I guess I'm starting my seventh year on tour, which is really a dream come true.  I played a lot of bad golf in those years and it's really fun to play well, so this is great.
Q. Talk about the final round out there today.
PETER MALNATI:   It was -- you know, the first two days on this course it felt like you could not make enough birdies.  Felt like every hole was a birdie hole the first two days.
Today I wanted to go out there with that mindset because I was starting a couple hours before the leaders, five or six shots behind the leaders, but it was pretty apparent pretty early that the course was tough today.  The greens were getting firmer and the wind blew a lot.
I actually had played really solidly.  I made to bogeys today, and neither one of them were holes where I just hit shots that were all that bad.  Probably could have gotten away with them earlier in the week, but it's just tough out there today.
So I was really pleased that I played really solidly and then finished -- birdied the holes that you can get on the back nine.  That felt really good.
Yeah, so it was exciting.
