Q. What mindset are you going to bring into the final round tomorrow, three back?  What's your philosophy as you go?
PETER MALNATI:   I think it's important, with the conditions obviously being such that scores are going to continue to be low.  I think it's important kind of you go in with the mindset of, you know, just go out there, try not to pay too much attention to what everyone else is doing, do your best, play well.  That's my strategy, anyway.
If you go out and you par the first four holes, you might see yourself and feel like you're just tumbling down the leaderboard and if you worry about that and start pressing, it can be bad.  My strategy is going to go out and try to mind my own business and not pay a lot of attention and shoot another low one.
Q. Is patience the key?
PETER MALNATI:   Even on a course where scores are crazy low, if you go out with the mindset that you have to birdie every hole, that can get dangerous.  Just try to be in good position as often as I can, keep the putter rolling well, that's all I really need to do.  That's all I can control.  So that's what I will focus on.
Q. Do you feel in your career you have more of an ability to go low, that 65-and-below round?
PETER MALNATI:   A lot of people talk about how that's so mental to do that.  It's probably mostly physical.  I'll playing better now than I have in a long time, maybe ever.
So yeah, I'm more capable of shooting a low one right now, but obviously there is a mental element to that, I guess, but at the end of the day, if you're not playing well, doesn't matter how good you are mentally, you're not going to shoot a low one.
I am playing well.  I feel like I did it on Sunday in Jackson a couple months ago.  It's in there.  It's in there.  I have the ability to go shoot a low one.  So we'll see.
