Q. How would you assess your play today?
ERIC DUGAS:   Scrappy.  Didn't hit it all that well off the tee.  You've got to find fairways here but short game did pretty well.  Hit a lot of good putts.  A lot didn't go in but kind of salvaged today.  Yeah, it was scrappy.
Q. Can you describe the atmosphere, the difference in the atmosphere today than when the fans have been here?
ERIC DUGAS:   Different, for sure, which everyone will say the same.  Part of the Sony is the people, the atmosphere.  So it is different.  The volunteers, a few people out, it's still the Sony, but yeah, it different even walking around Waikiki, just everything's a little bit different.
Q. Anything specific you want to improve upon for tomorrow?
ERIC DUGAS:   I've got to hit the fairway.  Iron game wasn't that bad.  Short game was obviously good to get me out of some of those situations but if I don't hit it off the tee better I'm not playing the weekend.
Q. Do you feel confident that you can come back and make the cut?
ERIC DUGAS:   Absolutely.  A small goal of mine is to make the cut but I obviously have bigger goals.  I've made the cut here a couple times.  I know the golf course very well.  The wind, the way it's playing, it's very firm, it's very fast.  It's in great shape.  There's no excuses out here.  I've got to hit fairways.
