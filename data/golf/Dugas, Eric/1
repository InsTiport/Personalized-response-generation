Q. Interesting round for you?
ERIC DUGAS:   Good way of putting it.
Q. How would you describe it?
ERIC DUGAS:   I played solid for the most part.  Couple bad swings at the wrong time and then one, I guess you'd call it a bad break but shouldn't hit where I hit it.  Had to take an unplayable and moved on.  Actually played fairly well today.  A couple holes got me.
Q. Is that your biggest takeaway is that you played well, but just some bad breaks?
ERIC DUGAS:   Not even bad breaks.  Bad swings.  The one on, I think it was 14, kind of in between the tree roots, take an unplayable there, but shouldn't hit it there, anyway.
I'm playing fine.  There's no reason I go to work every day and I'm at a golf club, but I felt good about the way I played.  I just didn't make the putt at the right time to keep the round going so kind of fell into that pit.
Q. You've made the cut here before and played here many times.  When you play with these guys, what do you take away and bring back to your day job?
ERIC DUGAS:   Confidence in my game for sure.  I played with a lot of these guys on the Latin America Tour and seen them progress.  Having seen them four or five years in a row, a lot more comfort getting on the tee.  Bob is a good friend of mine from Massachusetts, so that was a good pairing this week.  Going back there, it's fun to talk about inside the ropes with the membership and the staff.  I'm excited for the next event.
Q. Eerie without the fans, obviously, for those two days and the different vistas you get on this golf course?
ERIC DUGAS:   Definitely.  You see a little bit of the Raynor design more so coming up 17, 18.  You don't have depth perception as they were talking about, so it's a little different hitting into some of those greens.
Yeah, it's a little eerie.  Walking around Waikiki, it's got that same feel.  We were just talking about that coming over here.
