  Q. First of all, how does it feel to get a half point? I'll bet it feels like a whole point.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it does. We were kind of down most of the day, and just found it the last two holes really.  
  
  Q. The reason for the turnaround, you chipped in at 17, inspired golf?  
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, we knew if we could get to 17 and 18, 17 is a par-4, and sometimes on 18 you know you can make birdie and you've got a chance, so just lucky.  
  
  Q. And your playing partner Diana came in with that birdie on 18. How does that feel in your first Solheim Cup?  
 DIANA LUNA: It's just amazing. Catriona said to me, "Come on, knock it in for the glory." I had a great partner today, we got really lucky, I think.   
  
  Q. What was it like playing with her? Did she inspire you, as well?   
 DIANA LUNA: Absolutely. She's a great player, and she holed the putt at 16 and a chip 17, and it was just amazing. She's a great player.  
  
  Q. Catriona, do you prefer winning majors or Solheim Cup points?  
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Solheim Cup is fantastic, can't beat it. The crowd atmosphere and obviously playing with your partner is just great fun. Can't beat that.
