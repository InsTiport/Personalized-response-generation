Q. Great so you had a great day today.  What do you think was different from yesterday?
P.K. KONGKRAPHAN: I missed a lot of tee shots today.  You know, I kind of pushed.  You know, like that's the problem I work on the beginning of this week, and I had some problem today.  But I'm going to fix -- you know, I'm going to play better tomorrow.  But the putting worked pretty well today.  And solid wedges game, short game pretty good.
Q. So you're still liking your new clubs?  It still feels good?
P.K. KONGKRAPHAN: Oh, yeah.  My approach shot is very well.  I hit very confident.
Q. That's great.  How does it feel to be tied for third going into the final day with a fellow player from Thailand?
P.K. KONGKRAPHAN: Yeah, that's pretty good.  You know, we play -- actually, we play a lot when we play junior golf in Thailand.
Q. So you know each other pretty well?
P.K. KONGKRAPHAN: Yeah.  Might be playing together tomorrow.  Maybe.
Q. Yeah, maybe.  How do you think your game is different between the two of you, your approach?
P.K. KONGKRAPHAN: She's pretty strong.  Right now she had a lot of confidence, and a lot of wins.  So maybe it's very easy, this golf course might be very easy for her.  She might finish pretty well.
