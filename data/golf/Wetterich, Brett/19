Q.  Talk about playing with David.
BRETT WETTERICH:  For me I can't have a better partner.  David's a down to earth guy and he's always going to be in play for me.  I'm going to go out and play my game and try to make a lot of birdies, and hopefully he's going to do his part and I'm just going to help him out.
Q.  You face a pretty good group, some good experience there.
BRETT WETTERICH:  Two tough competitors.  We're going to have to go out there and play some solid golf and that's all there is to it.
Q.  When you get a challenge like that opening day, that's what you're looking for, get it out of the way?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Any match, no matter who it is, you go out, play your game and go out and do what you have to do.
