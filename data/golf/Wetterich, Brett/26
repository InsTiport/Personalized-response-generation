PHIL STAMBAUGH:  Can you talk about your year to this point?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Well, so far I've made two out of the four cuts, and I've just made a lot of bad mistakes in the tournaments that I've made the cut in, just a few bogeys and double bogeys, and it's really hurt me.  I'm trying to get myself to be a little bit more consistent.
PHIL STAMBAUGH:  We'll just go to questions.
Q.  This was your low round of the year.  Was there something about the golf course, the conditions or something that set up well for you?
BRETT WETTERICH:  No, I've always liked this golf course.  I've never really played well here.  I just haven't putted really good this year.  This week we worked a little bit harder on it, and it seemed to turn around today and I made some putts that I haven't been making lately.
Q.  Can you kind of elaborate on what you did putting wise?
BRETT WETTERICH:  It's really simple, really.  I concentrated a little bit more.  I took a little more time lining my feet with the line I wanted to hit the stroke on.  That's the only thing that really changed.  I think my feet were getting a little closed and it was causing me to hit some squirrelly putts.  I'm working hard on keeping square with my feet and with the head of my putter.
Q.  Talk about your mindset a little bit going forward.  Do you focus hard on making the cut, focus hard on winning the tournament?  What's your mentality as you go forward?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I just want to keep playing good.  I try not to make any bad mistakes out there.  I'm not really focusing on trying to make the cut or win the golf tournament.  I feel like if I go out and do the things I need to do and make a few birdies, we'll see where that takes me in the end.
PHIL STAMBAUGH:  Thank you for stopping by, and good luck the rest of the week.
