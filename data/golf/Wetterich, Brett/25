TODD BUDNICK:  We thank Brett Wetterich for stopping by after a 6 under 64 in the second round of the EDS Byron Nelson Championship.  Brett, seven birdies, just the one bogey today, a very nice round.
BRETT WETTERICH:  Yeah, I played solid out there today, just trying to be patient.  I ended up making a lot more birdies than I thought I would.  I had a bad bogey, I think, from the middle of the fairway.  Other than that, I think I played pretty well.
TODD BUDNICK:  Over the last four weeks your game has really come into shape, a T6 at Shell Houston, T4 at Zurich, then missed the cut last week, but you're back on top of the leaderboard right now.
BRETT WETTERICH:  I've been playing good, a 6th and a 4th and a missed cut last week, but even last week missing the cut I had a really good chance the second day, made three bogeys coming in.

But I'm playing well, just making some putts, which I haven't been doing, and I'm making the putts that keep you going, maybe a five footer that you need.  It just seems like I've been making a few of those putts.
Q.
On 18 you pulled the 3 wood out, and you stayed to the right and got the hill, then got in the right edge of the cup.  Seems like a wild ending.
BRETT WETTERICH:  It's to me one of those holes where you want to make par, especially where that pin was.  I hung it out there to the right off the tee, stayed in the fairway, and then I got a nice bounce coming into the green.  I took advantage of it.  I don't know how long that putt was, but it was nice to see it fall.
Q.
How much did you want that one to fall?  You had the body language that I haven't seen you have all week.
BRETT WETTERICH:  I had a few other putts that were close like that, hanging on the edge, so it was nice to see that one go in.
Q.
What did you think?  That hole has been changed a little bit this year.
BRETT WETTERICH:  The water on the left?  I hit it in there on Tuesday, I know that.  It doesn't bother me much.  You've still got to hit the shot.
Q.
Does it change your line off the tee or anything?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Not really, no.  The way it is today, where I'm going to hit the driver, it kind of goes in a little, the fairway thins in a little, so I'll just hit 3 wood.  If it gets downwind then I'll hit a driver, and I think my driver will be far enough to get over that.
Q.
Is it a significant change do you think for the rest of the field or is it more of a cosmetic alteration?  I guess if you hit it in there Tuesday, it's not cosmetic.
BRETT WETTERICH:  No, but I hit it pretty good to get just into the front part of it.  The wind was a little in our face.  You know, I don't know.  It's a pretty wide fairway.  I shouldn't say that because now I'll end up missing it probably the next two days.  But it's generous off the tee.  That's all I know.
Q.
Were you in the same spot here last year?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I think I was.  I think I was tied last year.
Q.
So obviously you've been here before.  Did you learn anything from last year that could help you this year?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I learned not to shoot over par on Saturday (laughter).  No, I don't know.  I'm just going to do what I've been doing the last few days, and hopefully it will work out a little better this year than it did last year.
Q.
Were there any changes you made that got your putter working that's led to the streak you've made?
BRETT WETTERICH:  No, that's how I am.  I'm streaky, I've always been that way, and it seems when I'm making the putts, just like anybody else, it seems that's when you play well.  That's what's happened the last three or four weeks.
Q.
What was the best streak you were on at any point in your life, amateur or junior golf?  Do you remember any hot streak?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Not really, no.  They kind of get put together.  I'll play good for three weeks or so, four weeks, and then kind of just hang out there and struggle making the cut, finish kind of middle to last.  Hopefully I'm done with all that.
Q.
You said out there that you don't know how, you don't know why.  When it's like that, do you just go with it?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I just like being along for the ride.  I haven't done anything different, haven't changed anything in my game, no swing changes, nothing with my putter.  Just everything is falling together for me.
Q.
Do you go and hit balls after this or do you leave well enough alone?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I didn't yesterday but today I think I'm going to.  I was hitting a few pull shots on my last five or six holes, so I might go hit balls for 20, 30 minutes and then go home.
Q.
One of the first times you got noticed was at Honda when you were in contention the weekend.  How much more comfortable are you with being out here and your game as opposed to when you were on that weekend at Honda?  Are you a better player now than then?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I think so, yeah.  I've been in this position a few times.  I shouldn't say a lot.  But I feel like I'm    not used to being here, but it doesn't bother me.  I definitely think I've benefitted from the other times that I've been playing in the last group.
Q.
Technically how would you compare your game, just tee to green and on the greens?  As a player are you also better than you were then?
BRETT WETTERICH:  I don't think hitting it    I think I'm probably about the same.  I might have brought my driver in a little bit, but other than that, I think I'm hitting it the same.  It's just the putts to be honest with you for me.
Q.
When you're out on the course, when do you realize you're kind of getting into a zone with the putter?  Is it when the first one goes in and it feels good?  Does it take two or three to kind of trigger you?
BRETT WETTERICH:  For me just skirting the edges, you get aggravated with that, but it's a good feeling knowing that you're hitting good putts, you're around the hole, and sooner or later, those putts are going to fall for you if you keep hitting them that way.  To me it just seemed like a couple fell in, maybe that good par saving putt falls in for me that will give me the boost I need.
Q.
Any particular putt today that really kind of got today's round off and flying for you?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Probably on 9, I guess.  I missed the fairway left and kind of had to punch one up.  I had a pretty long putt, I don't know how long it was, but it was just get your two putt and get out of there, and I creeped it down there and it ended up going in for me.  So I think that was a little bit of a momentum swing for me.
Q.
It rolled in for birdie and you kind of stole one?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Yes.
Q.
How different were the weather conditions yesterday?  We made a big deal out of the north wind.
BRETT WETTERICH:  I don't know the difference between the north and the south wind, I wouldn't say too much attention, but I know it played tough yesterday with the wind.  You really had to watch what you were doing.  Today there was a few holes where you had to pay attention, but for the most part, it was kind of calm out there.
Q.
So you could tell the difference?
BRETT WETTERICH:  Oh, there was a big difference to me.
TODD BUDNICK:  Let's just go through your birdies.  You started with one on No. 3, the par 4.
BRETT WETTERICH:  I can never remember them.  3, I hit a good drive down the fairway, missed the green and chipped it in on that hole, on 3.
Q.
About how far was your chip?
BRETT WETTERICH:  It was close.  It was just off the edge of the green.

7, par 5, I hit one up there green side, hit a good chip there to about four feet or five feet and made it.

Then 9, like I said, I made the pretty long putt there on 9.

Then 12, I hit 3 wood off the tee, hit a good pitching wedge in there to about maybe three feet, made that.

Then the par 3, the next hole, hit 9 iron to about six or seven feet and made that one.

Then the next hole, 3 iron off the tee and 9 iron to 15 feet or so, I guess, and snuck that one in there.

Then on the last hole I hit 5 iron    hit 3 wood, 5 iron into the green and just curled it in there on that right edge.

Bogey on 15, I hit a 3 wood off the tee and pulled a 6 iron way left and had a really tough up and down.  I actually hit a pretty good shot and just missed the putt.
