 Q. Brett, nicely done today. You really got it rolling on the front side, and then held it together on the back side.
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah. I got off to a really good start on the front nine, hit some good shots in there close and made the putts. 
 The back nine was a whole different story. Got away with hitting a couple bad shots, but managed to make some pars, and kept it to even par on the back nine. So it worked out good.

 Q. How nice is it to be just consistently healthy now where you can go out week after week and not have to worry about stuff?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Nice. You know, after almost two years of being off, and this is I think my 16th tournament this year. It's been nice to be able to come out and, one, just to be able to play again, and two, to not worry about injuries and stuff.

 Q. You and I talked Wednesday for just a second. You told me you got one more tournament left on your medical exemption, probably the first of next year, obviously, and then what? Tell me where you all stand.
 BRETT WETTERICH: Well, I don't know. I mean there's all kinds of options. Obviously, one, play good here this week and don't have to worry about any of that. 

 Q. Sure.
 BRETT WETTERICH: You know. Two, I got one tournament next year regardless; and you know, if things don't go right and I don't get my card, I'm obviously going to go to Q-School. So we'll see what happens.

 Q. But you obviously have some opportunities if you get -- you gotta hit the 06 number, the 08 number?
 BRETT WETTERICH: The 08 number. I mean I gotta finish third or better. 

 Q. Oh, okay.
 BRETT WETTERICH: That's what it is.

 Q. Well, you're playing great. What's really working for you now that you've had a chance to play consistently?
 BRETT WETTERICH: I don't know. I mean one week I got it, one week I don't, it seems like. I haven't really done anything great. Just everything okay. You know, and it's worked out all right some tournaments. Some it hasn't.

 Q. Go get 'em.
 BRETT WETTERICH: Thanks. 

 Q. So you're saying third or better this week? 
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah. 

 Q. Will take care of all of it?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Third or better by myself, you know, obviously in any of those orders, and that'll get me to next year.

 Q. With the one next year, do you get -- and if you hit the 08 number, you're good for all of next year?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah, I'm good for all of next year.

 Q. That's good. Shoot. Do you play it that way by design?
 BRETT WETTERICH: No. There's no design when it comes to that.

 Q. You didn't (indiscernible) for next year?
 BRETT WETTERICH: No. I got sick out in San Jose or else this would have been my last one. And there was no design to it. It's just how it fell, and that's it.

 Q. That's pretty smart.
 BRETT WETTERICH: I don't know. I've never been accused of that. 
 But no, but it's just what happened to work out that way. So if I need it, I need it. If I don't, hopefully I don't.

 Q. Are you completely healthy now?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah. Yeah.

 Q. Since when have you been?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Since I started back this year. Yeah, I've been fine.

 Q. Was there a couple of starts --
BRETT WETTERICH: There was one start in Hilton Head where I thought I might have reinjured it, but I didn't. Went and got MRIs again, and everything was fine. I took off like two more weeks that I was going to play, and you know, I came back and it was fine.

 Q. What about last year? Were you thinking you'd get back sooner and it just kept --
BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah, and then there was a couple other things, but that kind of held me back from starting earlier than what I wanted to. But other than that, I mean my wrist was fine and ready to go. 

 Q. The medical extension has been for the shoulder; right?
 BRETT WETTERICH: No.

 Q. No? It's for the wrist? How was it at Hilton Head? Did you hit a root?
 BRETT WETTERICH: No. Just hitting a drive on whatever, 15 is that hole, the par-5 there. That was it. I felt some of the same pains that I felt before I had to get surgery. Everything was good, though.

 Q. Right wrist.
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah.

 Q. What was the details of it?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Nothing. Just might have just broke loose some scar tissue or whatever. So it was no big deal.

 Q. Now, you have the one event next year regardless; right?
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah. Obviously if I make it through Q-School, I won't need it. Or if I play good here tomorrow, then I won't need it, but it's there if I need it.

 Q. How frustrating has this whole process been? I mean you had gotten yourself to a nice level there, Ryder Cup, and you know, winning a tournament in '07, had that close call with Tiger.
 BRETT WETTERICH: Yeah. It was good there for a couple years, and I finally got to where I wanted to be and playing really consistent out here. 
 You know, I was playing good, and then the whole '08 year was just a disaster, you know, so it's been really like three years, it feels like, you know, because that year was a total waste and then '09 was a total waste and half of this year.

 Q. Was '08 a waste because you were hurt and tried to play through it?
 BRETT WETTERICH: No. It was just a waste to me because I was playing so good.
