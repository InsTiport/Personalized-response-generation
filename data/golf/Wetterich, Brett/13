 Q.  How was it to leave it short on 18? 
 BRETT WETTERICH:  It's difficult.  I hit two really good shots on that hole and to leave one short, it's a pretty poor put.  It probably didn't matter in the end, but would have been nice to make it. 

 Q.  You have a firsthand look at Tiger now in the final round.  Why does he not seem to back up? 
 BRETT WETTERICH:  I know why today, because no one put any pressure on him.  Today was easy for him until maybe last few holes he had to think a little bit. 
 I don't know, you know, he goes along and he hits a lot of fairways and he hits greens and he makes putts usually when he needs them.  That's why he doesn't lose when he has the lead. 

 Q.  Does his game affect the way you play? 
 BRETT WETTERICH:  No.  We both hit it about the same distance, you know, so we could use the same clubs. 

 Q.  How was it for you to watch him firsthand? 
 BRETT WETTERICH:  It's good, it's nice to play with Tiger because you know you're near the lead.  It's good to play with him and hopefully get more chances to.
