 Q. WhatÂ’s your thoughts on the NFL's ruling that the Rams are going to L.A., the Raiders are staying in Oakland.   
JERRY RICE: Well, at first I thought it was going to be San Diego or the Raiders. Now it's the Rams. It's a great market.   
I used to love to play the Rams when they were down south. That was like the surface was unbelievable. But I think it's great to get football back to Los Angeles.  
   
 Q. You played with the Raiders too at the end of your career and know the fan base that supports them. Should they stay in Oakland?   
JERRY RICE: I feel a little biased because you've got so many great fans in Oakland that's really come out to support the Raiders, but you've also got a lot of fans down south that come out and support them also.   
I thought at first that the San Francisco 49ers and the Raiders, they would build a stadium together, but I guess Al Davis, he was not going to let that happen, to be honest with you.   
But I think the fan base is just unbelievable. No matter if they're in Oakland or if they're down south, you're still going to have that supportive base.  
   
 Q. What are your thoughts on a potential new stadium in Oakland?   
JERRY RICE: I'm not really in tune with it, but I feel that it can be done, and hopefully they can get it done because I think with the Raiders, they're getting ready to turn that whole program around, with Jack Del Rio, what he's doing, and with Derek Carr, they have a quarterback of the future that's going to -- where they can build around this guy and bring more players in that's going to help the team.
