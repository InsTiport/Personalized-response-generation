 Q.  So congrats.  What are your thoughts?  
STEWART HAGESTAD: I'm really proud of the way I kind of stayed in the moment and grinded.  Mike's obviously a great player in the area, and I knew that he was going to be a lot to handle.  I think he has the course record and he's got a lot of experience out here.   
So yesterday I played Jim Coleman and he was 3-down and he got it back to even.  So it was kind of like he grinded, plugged away at you, so maybe you can win a hole.  Just one hole at a time.  So, yeah, I'm happy to be moving on.   
 Q.  That was going to be my next question.  You come out, three holes, three down, what are you thinking?  
STEWART HAGESTAD: I don't want this to come off the wrong way, but I figured if I just played my own game and did what I was capable of and hit fairways and greens that you could get yourself right back in it.  Match play is so much about momentum.  Little things like hitting first off the tee, putting a ball on the fairway.  Even if it's a little bit of pressure, everyone feels it.  I just kind of figured that if you play your own game and kind of kept plugging away and take it one hole at a time.   
So, yeah, it was a rough start, but I think we already started like 4-over through 5 last week and ended up winning by like five.  So I'm happy about the way I really grinded back.
