Q. You jumped on him early and didn't let up. What did you do?
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah, I just played solid all day. It got a little windier today. I mean, just made a bunch of pars. He gave me a couple, but I also played solid, so kind of a mix of those two was why the score was more on the lopsided side.
Q. You birdied the first two.
STEWART HAGESTAD: No, I parred 2. I birdied 1 -- yeah, I birdied 1 --
Q. And how did you birdie the first hole?
STEWART HAGESTAD: Just got up-and-down from the left side. Hit a good drive, got up-and-down from the left side of the green. I think he probably had like 10 feet for par. I don't want to say lag it in there with good speed, but just try and make it. I don't know, I played solid.
Q. What are some of the good things you did today?
STEWART HAGESTAD: I feel like I've been putting it well all week. I drove it well, which was nice to make it a little more stress-free. I made a couple really nice up-and-downs when I needed to. Just stayed patient and played within myself.
Q. And then obviously this wind has come up now, and it's going to be a factor this afternoon. How does that change how you play this course?
STEWART HAGESTAD: We've played in wind before. You know, so I'm sure maybe just be a little bit more on the conservative side. If it comes up, it's relatively generous off the tee, so if you can hit fairways, that obviously helps. But it just means you're probably not going to be able to hit it as close. I don't know if they're changing the pins. They probably will, or leaving them the same. I don't know, just stay conservative, hit to the middle of the green, don't try and do anything really crazy.
