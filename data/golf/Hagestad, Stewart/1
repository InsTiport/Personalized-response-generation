  Q. Just final thoughts on this week, today?
 STEWART HAGESTAD:   I played great.  It's been an awesome week.  Made it further than I've ever made it before.  My goal besides to obviously win was try and make it to the quarters.  That was kind of what I thought I had to get to to potentially earn a spot for the U.S. Open.  I don't know how the math is going to shake out.  I'll be super bummed if it's not the case, but life goes on.
 But hey, I played great.  I knew when I drew Ty that we were going to have a real tough one today, as I told Brentley.  He's a good golfer, but he's just such a mature person, and that comes from both his parents.  I think some of the best players out there are ones that are really smart and just kind of regimented and not cerebral but kind of think things through, and he's all those things.  His ranking doesn't reflect what he is.  He's a stud.
 It was a great week.  Bummed it ended a little short, but it's okay.  I put up a good fight.
