Q. Ran into a buzz saw today.
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah.  I felt like I played pretty solid all day.  I think I was even until 16.
He chipped in at 1; he gave a couple after that, but really, really played solid really from 7 until 16 I guess.  He played great and he deserves a lot of credit for the way he competed.  He made a ton of birdies, which is what you need to do in match play.
Q. What did you think that he did well that kept you at bay, from getting back in the match?
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah, this golf course I feel like really lends itself to big guys that have a little speed off the tee and that drive it well.  That's one of my strengths for sure.  I always like being able to hit driver.
(Indiscernible) off the tee box after he made a couple birdies, kept hitting it ten yards further than me and kept hitting fairways, it's awfully tough to get the box back.
But like I said, he played great.  Another thing he did really well is when he did hit the green but not ten, twelve, fifteen feet, he did a really, really nice job of lag putting, which I'm sure made it very, very stress free.
Q. Finally, from last year at this time to now, what has this whole calendar year been like for you?
STEWART HAGESTAD: It's wild.  It's been a dream come true.  I can 100% say that it's changed my life, and whoever ends up lifting the trophy at the end of the week will be able to say the same.
But it's a dream come true to be a USGA champion.  It's a dream come true to be able to represent the USGA the way that I have had the opportunity to do so in the last year.  It's motivating to try and earn my way back.  There is always next year, but I'm going to be able to rest easy knowing that I've had the chance to be a USGA champion before, and hopefully we'll be back.
