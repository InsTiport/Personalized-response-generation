Q.   Steph, last year you were in the lead with seven holes to play and didn't win.   This year you've come back and you're in the hunt after the first round.   What did you learn? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   Last year, I was a little nervous.   I'm trying to get control of my nerves. 
Today I was a little nervous on the first hole but I calmed down after that, started to just, kept saying to myself keep swinging, keep having fun, enjoy it and concentrate.   I have to keep concentrating and stay focused. 

Q.   This year you've got your dad on the bag.   Does that make a difference?
STEPHEN CURRY:   Oh, absolutely.   And he's carrying that big heavy pro bag, too. 

Q.   With your experience last year, if you're in the hunt Sunday, what do you think will happen? 
STEPHEN CURRY:   With the experience that I had from last year, I think I'll stay cool and calm and be ready to play.   I want to be in the hunt on Sunday. 

Q.   You and 3s are synonymous.   And 3s are good out here on the golf course.   What are you thinking; how many are you thinking you'll need on Sunday?
STEPHEN CURRY:   3s are always good.   And I'm hoping I'm making a lot of them come Sunday.
