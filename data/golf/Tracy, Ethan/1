Q. Ethan, congratulations.  What a great today of golf for you, 6-under par.  That's 65.  Right now tied for the top of the leaderboard.  Your thoughts on how you played today.
ETHAN TRACY: I played really solid, kept it in it front of me.  Didn't try and like force it on this golf course.  You kind of have to place your shots into the greens and take what you got.
I had a lot of 30, 40-footers that you needed to take your two-putt and get out of there, and couple wedges close and ended up pretty good.
Q. You hit every green.
ETHAN TRACY: Oh, I didn't know that.
Q. I know these greens are big but you hit all 18.  That says a lot about how you're striking the golf ball.  On this golf course I hear you got to put it in the right spot to have a chance.
ETHAN TRACY: I hit it really well.  There's a lot of pin locations where you can't aim at, middle of the greens were really good and that makes the greens a lot bigger.
Q. You're 191st on FedExCup point standings right now.  This is one of these events you get 500 points if you win.  This is an opportunity for you in the coming week to make some moves here.
ETHAN TRACY: Definitely.  I'm not upset with where I'm at.  I've been playing well as of late and get into a few more events and we'll see what happens.
Q. What do you think of this place?
ETHAN TRACY: I like it.  It's different.  It's not the typical course that we play and we have to think a lot out there, which is really nice.
