  Q. Maria, another great round of level par 72 today. How do you assess the round?   
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: Well, you know, just I was playing well. And I wasn't quite finishing it, and it's just I didn't put as well as yesterday. So I'm a little bit disappointed but overall I just played well.   
  
  Q. You started really well with two birdies on the 13th and the 14th, were you feeling good about the round at that point?   
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: Yeah, it was long putts, and obviously it gave me confidence. But then I felt back and just falling back and forwards all the time.  
  
  Q. What sort of tripped you up? You had a couple of bogeys coming in. What were the highs and the lows?  
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: Hard to say. I mean, you know, it's just one of those days when you just kind of -- up-and-down, you feel happy and then you go back and I was trying to stay positive, even like having a bogey and keep going.   
  
  Q. So 4-under par is still right up there, how are you feeling for the next two rounds?   
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: You know, first round really gave me confidence and today I played well, so hopefully I'll keep hitting balls like I'm hitting now and go even lower.   
  
  Q. And how does it feel to be playing in the sunshine in Dubai?   
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: Awesome. I mean, last week we played really under tough conditions and it was really cold and I really enjoyed that.   
  
  Q. You're confident for the next two days?   
 MARIA VERCHENOVA: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball good. I'm putting well and I'm confident, so, yeah.
