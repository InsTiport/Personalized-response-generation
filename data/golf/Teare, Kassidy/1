 Q.  Special place to find the weekend.  How often did you play here growing up?  I know you practiced here a lot.  
KASSIDY TEARE: Not very often.  I think it was like a very special occasion when you got to play here.  I played here -- I can think of one or two maybe junior events.  Probably around ten times.  Maybe.  The oldest I would've been is like 14, 15.   
That's my family.  It's so embarrassing.   
 Q.  How many people are here that know you, do you think?  
KASSIDY TEARE: A lot.  I know that this weekend is going to be a lot more.   
 Q.  For a lot of people, playing at home is a tough thing.  There is a lot have added a pressure.  Do you feel that, or is it more fun?  
KASSIDY TEARE: It's definitely more fun.  I think it's just more busy.  I don't know.  I guess at the same time, to have a ton of people clapping for you when you're only like 1- or 2-under is really fun.  Keeps you going.  Keeps you alive when you're getting tired.   
 Q.  So your brother I heard you say quit his job to caddy.  What did he do?  
KASSIDY TEARE: He was just working at a finance company.   
 Q.  Oh, like a real job.  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah.  (Laughter.)  My family seriously is all in.  Yeah, we've given of a lot to be here.  It's really, really important for me.  It's really awesome.   
 Q.  How old is he?  
KASSIDY TEARE: He's 26.   
 Q.  Is he a golfer?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah, yeah.  He's a really, really good golfer.  Actually still beats me.   
 Q.  Oh, really?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did he play in college?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah, he did.  He played for Monterey Bay.   
 Q.  So he's actually legitimately helping you out there?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yes, yes.  I wouldn't hire him if he wasn't helping me.   
 Q.  What are the coordinates on your...  
KASSIDY TEARE: Oh, my fiancee is going to love this interview.  This is the location that he proposed to me at.  It's my way of wearing my ring when I'm not wearing my ring.   
 Q.  What was that location?  
KASSIDY TEARE: On the cliffs right here in Carlsbad.   
 Q.  Wow.  When was that?  
KASSIDY TEARE: The 13th of July.   
 Q.  That's cool.  So did he do that or did he get you the necklace.  
KASSIDY TEARE: He got me this, yes.   
 Q.  When he proposed?  
KASSIDY TEARE: No.  He actually got me this for my birthday like two weeks ago or so.   
 Q.  Very nice.  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah.   
 Q.  One more thing.  You've got some former teammates here and girls you've coached here.  What's it like playing in front of them on a big stage?  
KASSIDY TEARE: I'm more excited for them to see it.  I know that these girls are plenty good to do this one day, and I'm glad they get to come out here and experience it, especially knowing somebody.   
I'm proud to start a little bit more of an alumni out here.  We don't have anybody.  By the time they get here I'm sure I'll have the hang of it and I can actually like help them out.   
 Q.  I do have one more quick one.  You said your family is all in.  Is that financially helping you out, too?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Absolutely, yeah.  Like I did my best and worked as long as I could through the Symetra Tour having a full-time job.  Picked up some design jobs and made some company logos and things like that.   
At one point you're just like, We're going to go in debt and give it all we've got.  I can't dedicate myself and have a full-time job at the same time, so we made a decision and we're going to do this for as long as we can.   
 Q.  As a family?  
KASSIDY TEARE: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  What do your parents do?  
KASSIDY TEARE: My dad works for the FAA in air traffic control, and my mom is retired.
