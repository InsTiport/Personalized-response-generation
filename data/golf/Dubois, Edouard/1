 Q.   How good was that today?   
EDOUARD DUBOIS:   Yeah, it was very nice.   Putting was really good on the front nine.   
   
 Q.   Was it putter that really worked?   
EDOUARD DUBOIS:   Yeah, on the front nine, I putted really, really well and then pretty normal on the back nine.   
   
 Q.   Was there something during the round where you thought, this is good?   
EDOUARD DUBOIS:   On 9, I was lucky, was left of the green in the rough and tough chip, and hit it ten metres and holed the putt.   It was nice.   
   
 Q.   Been a long day for you?  
EDOUARD DUBOIS:   Yeah, a little bit lucky, we got no more rain the last two hours maybe.   So more wind for the guys that started at 12.30 maybe.   Sometimes you're lucky and sometimes not.   
We shared a room this week, and yeah, it's nice to play with a guy who is a friend, Guerrier.
