GRANT WAITE:  I wanted to get to 8-under.  Tough day today.  I didn't play particularly well, but I hung in there and made a couple good putts when I needed them, and really made only one mistake, and that was on No. 8 where I made double.  But it's a tough hole, but I hit a poor tee shot.  So overall, I'm happy with the way I hung in there.  Kept myself in the tournament.  If that's the worst I play all week, then I'll be fine. 


Q.  You're only one shot out of the lead. 

GRANT WAITE:  Yeah, one shot off the lead going into the weekend, that gives you a chance to play.  You want to be able to have a good round tomorrow and keep yourself in the tournament.  You just want to keep yourself there, to give yourself a chance to win coming into the last nine holes on Sunday. 


Q.  (Inaudible.)

GRANT WAITE:   I think for the most part, we got about eight or nine holes yesterday, though it was reasonably calm, and then the last eight or nine holes was very blustery.  And then this afternoon, the last maybe five or six holes it kind of calmed down again.  No doubt, we got a weather break.  But you play the PGA TOUR long enough, it goes both ways.  So take it when it comes. 


Q.  So you're not disappointed?

GRANT WAITE:   No, I'm not.
