Q. So tell me, 3 under par, you've got to like where you're sitting right now.GRANT WAITE: Yeah, any time you're under par on this golf course, it's good.  You think the leader right now will be 5 or 6 under.  Going into the weekend, if I play well, I'm in a good spot.Q. What did you like about the course?GRANT WAITE: Everything.  I think that from just the layout of the holes to the way that the USGA have set it up, speed of the greens, pin placements, tees, everything has been fantastic.  The weather, you know, it's hot, but there's no wind.  It's just beautiful. I've played a number of U.S. Opens on the regular tour, and I would say this is one of the most enjoyable and well-run U.S. Opens from the golf course to the facilities to everything.  It's fantastic.Q. You kind of touched base on it, the weather.  Pretty hot out here?GRANT WAITE: Well, it's hot.  I'm from Florida so it's not Florida hot, with the humidity we've got down there.  It's hot.  You can feel it burning you.  I had 13 bottles of water out there in 18 holes.  I only went to the bathroom once.  So it's drying you out. If you stay hydrated, try and walk in the shade, it's not too bad.Q. Getting a plan for tomorrow?GRANT WAITE: I didn't drive it as well these two rounds I'd like to have.  So if I can drive it better, then you've just got to be really patient, pick your spots when you've got a good number and you're feeling good, go ahead and attack.  If not, par is always a good score out here.  So like I said, I like my position.  If I play well, I should have a chance to win.Q. Thank you.  Good luck tomorrow.GRANT WAITE: Thanks.
