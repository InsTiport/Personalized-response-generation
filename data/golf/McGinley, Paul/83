 Q. Did you play better than you actually scored? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: My short game wasn't sharp. I played decently. Tough golf course this afternoon. It's a hell of a tough golf course now. I think they have overdone the new tee boxes. It's become a monster golf course. 
 The length of shots you're required to hit, the second shots -- the green-sides, particularly when they are firm, and they were firm this afternoon. You're asked to hit six and 5-irons into firm greens.
 As I say, the new tee boxes, the length does not match the green-side. So it is what it is. 

 Q. How did you play today?
 PAUL McGINLEY: I played well, yes, I did. I thought I played well. My short game wasn't sharp enough. Maybe that was lack of play. I've only played two tournaments the last six weeks, but I struggled out of the bunkers. Didn't control the ball out of the bunkers, and never got any spin on my bunker shots. And my chipping wasn't great, either. 
 And then I hit a lot of good putts, but pace today -- I don't think I putted badly but struggled with pace and I didn't control my distance well. When you don't do that, it's tough to hole putts. 
 I need to play a bit better or score well. I'm not too far away. I think the scoring is a reflection of how tough the golf course is. When the greens got crusty this afternoon, as I say, with the length of shots we are required to hit in to small quadrants of greens, it doesn't match up. 

 Q. Chipping out of the rough as you had to do on the par 3, 16, it's obviously tempting to --
 PAUL McGINLEY: Yeah, it's always tough. A lot of it is luck. You know, I love the fact that after I hit it, the ball came right out of the middle of the club. It's just that the grass got in front of it and all of a sudden it's like a duff.
