PAUL McGINLEY:  Unfortunately we didn't start the tournament until the weekend.  It was good to shoot 133 on Saturday and Sunday, but we left far too much to do in the first two days.  We just couldn't gel on Thursday and Friday, but we're really pleased to shoot 66 and 67.  It was great to come back to a course where we won the World Cup six years ago.  It's just a pity that we couldn't have finished higher, but considering we were 17th at the halfway stage, this is pretty good.
