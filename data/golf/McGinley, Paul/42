Q.   Paul, your reflection on today's round, much tougher conditions today?
PAUL McGINLEY:   Much tougher.   We had a good test of golf today.   Keeping it on the fairways is very important.   Yeah, we had a good test of golf. 

Q.   How do you find the greens, because they are not as smooth and one or two players are talking about how they are not rolling as good as they usually are?
PAUL McGINLEY:   Normally the greens are immaculate when we come here, probably the best greens of the year.   Obviously with the heavy weather we have had, it's really made them very soft and once they get soft or easy you're going to get a bit impatient.

Q.   Finishing second in Wales, what is it with your form?   A bit of an Indian summer; obviously you've been working hard and getting your knee ready, is that something to do with it? 
PAUL McGINLEY:   Yeah, I've played less of a schedule this year, as well, too, which has given me a little appetite.   And you know what it's like, you know, you play well and it gives you confidence.   It's been a while since I've played a schedule like that.   I played really well in Korea and that gave me a boost and then obviously decent at Wentworth and then Wales. 

Q.   5‑woods in the bag, what's that all about?
PAUL McGINLEY:   I have to say, I'm getting technology‑‑ the last hole, no way I can hit a 5‑iron out of that lie.   But I was able to chop it around the green and try to get up‑and‑down.   Also I can drive it through the green as well, so I can hit it low, as well, too.   Yeah, I'm feeling a real benefit from that, and the new 3‑wood, it gives me an extra 15 or so yards which makes a lot of the par 5s on in two which they weren't before.
