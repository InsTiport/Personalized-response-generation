 Q.  Your first round in the Senior Open, how did you play?  
PAUL McGINLEY: Played all right.  I played much better than my score.  Really disappointed.  Really poor finish.  Very tough conditions.  Really tough golf course.  Tough breeze, crosswinds the whole way around.  Really tough.   
 Q.  Can you tell me, these conditions, how hard is it physically and mentally?  
PAUL McGINLEY: Yeah, obviously concentration is a big part of it.  My concentration waned a bit at the end.  I hit a couple of slack shots and paid big prices for them, and that's what happens.  It wears you down.  There's no easy hole out there.  There's no hole where you think, okay, I can have a rest here now and I should make a birdie here.   
But it's really, really difficult, relentless the whole way through.  There's a lot of danger out there.  Those fairway bunkers, a lot of out-of-bounds in play.  So it's a real test today.   
 Q.  Hard to tell what a winning score could be?  
PAUL McGINLEY: You can't tell.  These weather conditions, you have no idea.  Level par will certainly win if it's four days like this.
