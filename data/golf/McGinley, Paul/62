   PAUL McGINLEY: It was a tough back nine today and I dropped two shots on 13 and 17. I made two bad plays. But overall I am very happy because I was hitting the ball extremely well. I had lots of opportunities and I putted solid. I enjoy the challenge of links golf and I've always been a fan, particularly at St Andrews. If you don't like it here then you're in the wrong business. But if the forecast is right then tomorrow is all about holding on to what we've got. Gales are forecast and if that's correct then it's going to be a very rough day. It was an excellent week in the Vivendi Trophy and to be honest the most satisfying thing was the respect that all the guys gave me during the week. A lot of them have sent lovely text messages since and that means a lot.
