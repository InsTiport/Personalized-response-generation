 Q.  Just tried to stay focused on what you were doing? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, the boys were playing so well; they both got off to good starts.  Then I started 3-putting trying to force it.  Then when I made those 3-putts in a row, then it was's case of hoping I try to make sure I get to third place. 

 Q.  Good finish? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, good back nine.  Three 3-putts, obviously not great.  Struggled with the putter today.  But 17 greens in reg again, good week's golf.  Two weeks off now, play Portugal. 

 Q.  A lot of rewards and steps in the right direction? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah.  You know last year I didn't have any Top 10's, and I have two this year, ninth in Abu Dhabi and a third here, so it gets me up in the World Ranking and gets me up the Order of Merit. 
 Ryder Cup, I'm still way behind, but I need a big finish.  It's always about the big finish.
