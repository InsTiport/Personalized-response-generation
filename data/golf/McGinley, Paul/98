 Q.  How are you feeling after a week off? 

PAUL McGINLEY:  I have got a heavy flu. Seems like all our systems are run down as quite a few of us have been sick since the Ryder Cup. But I'm alright. Try and salvage something from the end of the season. I have three tournaments to go - this one, Majorca and Valderrama. Try to salvage my Order of Merit position and get up the Order of Merit basically.
Q.  What have you been doing since The K Club?

PAUL McGINLEY:  I was in bed for four days with the flu. I haven't been doing much. Obviously disappointing not to be playing The Grove but no excuses. I have had a poor season and fell out of the top 50. That's about it. Of course, the Ryder Cup was a great experience, one I will never forget. We had a great time. You have to enjoy your successes. Play hard and party hard and I think we did both of those.
Q.  Is it difficult to get back into the swing of things after a week like that?

PAUL McGINLEY:  Not really. You have to move on. Back to Paul McGinley and as I say trying to salvage something from the rest of the season with three events in Europe.  See how the week pans out.
