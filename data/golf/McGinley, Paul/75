   PAUL McGINLEY: I thought David Williams and his team did a wonderful job in extremely difficult conditions. I thought the golf course was very difficult, but it was playable. 

 Q. It's all about opinion, isn't it? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: Well, it's about opinion. I mean, it's a really tough day. There wasn't a hole -- there wasn't a hole that wasn't on in two. Although when I played the 8th, it was gusting and we didn't get home driving a 3-wood. I think guys earlier, who played earlier were getting home in two. 
 So I mean, what more do you want? There wasn't a par 3 that wasn't reachable, and there wasn't a par 5 that wasn't reachable in three shots, and there wasn't a par 4 that wasn't reachable in two shots. 
 Now, I don't speak for other guys who maybe said their ball moved a few times, but nobody in our group had a ball move. On one hole, we got ball blown off the tee four times, but other than that there was no problem; which I've never seen before. 

 Q. Up into the wind? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: I thought David Williams was doing an excellent job and he should be commended under extremely difficult conditions. I thought it was very difficult. I can understand why a lot of people are frustrated, but at the same time, the golf course was playable, in my opinion.
