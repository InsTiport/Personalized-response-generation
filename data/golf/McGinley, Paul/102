Q.  Padraig, 2 up and three to play.  Does that feel like a bit of a kick in the stomach or are you glad you got something out of it?

PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  We did well to be 2 up at that stage.  It's obviously disappointing.  The boys finished well.  They finished birdie, birdie, birdie, which is what was asked.  They certainly deserved a halve, even though we feel a little bit disappointed with the halve.
Q.  When you holed that putt at 17, we know you've holed some good putts in your time.  Did you think that was possibly it for you?

PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, I missed the question.
Q.  When you holed the putt at 17, I know you holed a big putt at The Belfry, but that was under pressure.  Did you think that was going to take you through this match?

PAUL McGINLEY:  No, 18 is a par 5 and Padraig smashed a tee shot.  He hit it so well but didn't budge in the wind.  That's just the way.

As Padraig said, they finished birdie, birdie, birdie, which is a strong finish when they needed it.  Yeah, we're disappointed, but of course we are.  This is the top level golf in the world you're going to play, and that's what happens.
Q.  What about the support you have out here this week?  Do you have to try and cut yourself off from that a little bit or open yourself up and let it happen?

PAUL McGINLEY:  A lit of both.  Jesper Parnevik told me my first Ryder Cup, you either ride the adrenaline or you fight it.  It was a big thing for us, and the crowd really got behind us and we really enjoyed it; pity the past three holes.
