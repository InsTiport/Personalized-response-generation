  Q. Thoughts on being named captain?   
 PAUL McGINLEY: It's a great honour, and I don't know if I'm going to be a good captain or not. I certainly have the experience of playing on teams. In terms of Ryder Cups, Royal Trophys and Seve Trophys, I've learned a lot from all of the captains I've played under, and we'll see how I work out.   
  
  Q. What was the process? Did you get a phone call, and you thought, yeah, that sounds appealing?   
 PAUL McGINLEY: No, I didn't get a phone call, no. Monty was -- I don't know if this is public knowledge or not, but Monty in his capacity as Ryder Cup Captain was able to choose the captain, so he asked me if I wanted to be captain, so I said yeah.  
  
  Q. Immediately, no thoughts?  
 PAUL McGINLEY: No, I slept on it. But I had a good instinct if I was asked, I would do it.  
  
  Q. And having decided that you will do it, any thoughts on how it will actually work out or you've not got to that stage yet?  
 PAUL McGINLEY: I've not got to that stage. I haven't looked at the qualification process at the moment to see who is leading and who is not. I must look at that, and I will look at that shortly.   
 As I say, I don't know how good of a captain I'm going to be, but I certainly have enough experience, and it's a role I'm really looking forward to.   
  
  Q. Good that the Trophy is actually going ahead?  
 PAUL McGINLEY: It's brilliant that it's going ahead. It's great that it's retaining the name of the Seve Trophy, and hopefully we'll have a game in the spirit of the way Seve played golf.
