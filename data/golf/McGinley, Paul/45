 Q.   Pleased with that?   
PAUL McGINLEY:   I played very well.   I had a double‑bogey on 9 today which took the wind out of my sails a bit, but I did really well to regroup on the back nine.   I played really solid, probably the four days, it's probably the best I've played of the four days today.   Shot 70, my second‑best score of the week so overall I'm pretty pleased.  
   
 Q.   And the red figure in the box at the last is important, isn't it?  
PAUL McGINLEY:   Yeah, I hit such a brilliant second shot.   I thought my second shot was going to be ten feet and over the last roll, the ball went into the back bunker and I had a treacherous bunker shot but fortunate got up‑and‑down.   
   
 Q.   Bodes well?   
PAUL McGINLEY:   Yeah, it does bode well.   Hopefully have a good season going forward, and I'm particularly looking forward to the Irish Open.   I think it's going to be great this year in Portrush.   I played there last week, which was nice to see the course again.   I have not played it since I was an amateur.   Looking forward to going up there, and as I say, a lot to look forward to.   
I think this is only my fourth event this year, and now from Wentworth on, which is my next event, I'll play a full schedule from then on.
