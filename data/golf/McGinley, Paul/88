 Q. Thoughts on the day? 
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  I didn't really play any better or worse than I had done the other days but it was nice just to put a score on the board today. Obviously my putting was better but I hit my irons a bit closer to the pins too which helped me gain a bit of momentum. 
 
 Q.  Happy that your form of the end of last year is continuing? 
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  Yes, but it is about results, isn't it, and I need to go out there tomorrow and shoot a good score, that is more important than playing well. 
 
 Q.  Do you think the leader is catchable? 
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  You never know. I mean he is obviously on fire and he has had another good start today but we'll see. I can only paddle my own canoe. I've never played with him and I didn't even know what he looked like until I saw his picture on the website the other day but he is obviously a hell of a good player. 
 But there are a lot of good young players on the European Tour at the moment and I'd say probably more so than on the US Tour at present. The age profile is much lower on the European Tour and I'd say that the future was very bright for European golf.
