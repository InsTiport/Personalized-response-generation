  Q.  Well played last week?   
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  Great week. I played really well and enjoyed it. Obviously disappointed to finish 19th. I felt I played much better than 19th. But the story is Padraig, Irish winner of the Open. The big thing was we had a European winner. The press will no longer go on. The Irish pres shave been going on for so long about when we were going to get an Irish winner of the Irish Open and Padraig has done that. The next thing was a European winner of a Major and Padraig has done that now. He is knocking down the hurdles one after the other and all credit to him.   
  
  Q.  Your performance last week must give you confidence coming here?   
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  Yeah. I played well last week, played some good golf. But a slow start on Sunday and slow start for the second day cost me a higher finish. I didn't do it for 72 holes. I did it for 54 holes and not 72.   
  
  Q.  Different challenge this week?   
 PAUL MCGINLEY:  Chalk and cheese. Just try and strike the ball well and hole some putts.
