 Q.  Hard to believe? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  The standard on the Tour now is just unbelievably strong, it's incredible, really incredible.  The scoring -- the cuts are much lower than you think and the winning score is much lower than you think.  The standard now, it's just so difficult to win on Tour. 

 Q.  Is it hard to believe just how well Graeme is playing, and Jeev pulling away? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  They are obviously feeding off each other which does help.  But I'll play my own game, do the best I can and see what happens tomorrow. 

 Q.  I suppose the putting again, some level putts which didn't quite get there. 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, I feel I putted well again.  I haven't putted lights-out, but I've certainly putted well the last three days.  I have no complaints about my putting.  But as I said yesterday, you know, if I'm going to win, I'm going to have to play really well, and I've played well, but not really well.  And tomorrow I'll have to play unbelievably well. 

 Q.  Is there a really, really low one out there that you can possibly challenge? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, Graeme has done it.  He's shot back-to-back 64s here; of course he is.  All I can do is play as well as I can.  As I said I feel I need to play better.  I'm scoring nicely but I need to play better.  If I play a lit better tomorrow, you never know. 

 Q.  How will you approach a final day, because you can't really chase down too much of that score, can you?  You've just got to play your best and hope. 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  I don't feel like I'm playing well enough to be able to chase down a lot of pins.  As I said, if I can start playing well and take on a little bit more aggressive -- but I need to play well. 
 When you're playing well, you can take on the pins and be really aggressive.  As I say, that's really important to play well and be in control of what you're doing. 

 Q.  Did you notice the leaderboard on the way around? 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, he's obviously had a wonderful start.  Took off, the first score was 5-under after six.  Same yesterday, great start and he's done two days in a row.  Incredible. 

 Q.  Does it leave you tearing your hair out that these guys -- 
 PAUL McGINLEY:  Far from it.  I'm not tearing my hair out.  I'm not surprised.  It has not taken me by surprise.  As I say, the standard, it's hard to appreciate how high the standard is on Tour. 
 As I say, I need to play better tomorrow and all I'm concerned about is me, Paul McGinley, and if I play better, you never know what might happen.
