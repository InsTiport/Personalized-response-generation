Q. Was that your best round on the Old Course since you turned 50?
PAUL McGINLEY: I don't know.  You know better than I do.  I've been playing solid.  I played two tournaments in Europe this year, and Top-10 in both of them.  I haven't played a lot.  I've only played three events this year.  Obviously got other commitments going on but I'm really pleased.  Playing the Old Course on a day like this is just fabulous.
Q. How nice to get off to a good start?
PAUL McGINLEY: It's important.  With the wind helping you going down off the right, you've got to make hay on the way out.  You're hitting a lot of wedge shots in on par 5s.  2 is a 4-iron, so you have to be hoping to turn in 2- or 3-under par because that back nine is really tough.
Q. How tough was the wind coming in on the back nine?
PAUL McGINLEY: Really tough.  That's where the teeth in St. Andrews is.  You know, and when it comes in off the left, that's probably the tougher of all the winds.  I thought the pin positions were moderate.  I mean, if they were up or if they were Sunday pin positions, they would be a lot tougher.  They were accessible.  Even though the holes were playing long into the wind, the pin positions were not as treacherous as they can be in those last six holes.
Q. Nice to be playing St. Andrews again?
PAUL McGINLEY: Oh, it always is.  Any time you come here, even for a practise round, there's something magical and mystical about the place.  If you love golf and the history and all it stands for, this is the place to be.
