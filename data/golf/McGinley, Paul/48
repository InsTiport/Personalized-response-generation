   PAUL McGINLEY: We've just arrived. Got here about an hour ago, and taking it all in. I'm looking forward to seeing the end of this game here. It's a big game for the Europeans. If they can manage to win this game or even get a halve would be good.

 Q. Alison's been calling for the crowd to get excited. I think they are now, don't you? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: Yeah, I was saying I've only arrived an hour ago, yeah, it's been very loud since I arrived here, anyway.

 Q. The Europeans are in a crucial match at the 17th hole. What are the tactics when you're in that situation? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: I think halve would be a good result for them. If they can get a halve because they've had a very good mornings, they have to keep the Americans to only winning by a halve this morning, and it's just progressing with the wind.

 Q. The European team is getting off to a fast start and dominating the matches then America has been coming back, but what causes those shifts in momentum? 
 PAUL McGINLEY: It's hard to say, isn't it? It's a very strong pairing down the end here. The American team are very strong here. 
 Creamer and Kerr, they're very strong players. If Europe can get a halve out of this last match, I think it will be very good result.
