PAUL McGINLEY:  I was lucky to shoot 72.  I didn't play very well.  I feel my strategy was right.  My course management was right, my attitude was good.  I didn't pull the shots off.  I smothered a lot of shots trying to hit it low, keep it out of the wind and ended up smothering some shots which is not something I do very often.  It was a tough day and glad it's over.
Q.  What's the forecast for tomorrow?
PAUL McGINLEY:  I don't know.  I wouldn't mind conditions like that again tomorrow.
Q.  Still is there for the taking for you, isn't it?
PAUL McGINLEY:  Of course it is.  While I did shoot 72, I did putt well.  Quality of my golf wasn't great, but did well to hang in there.  What am I, two off the lead with 18 holes to go?  I'd taken this at the start of the week.
