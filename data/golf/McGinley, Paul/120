Q.   Talk about the round, how you played today.  You had it really going there for a while.
PAUL McGINLEY:  Yeah, I played very well today, a lot of opportunities.  I played a really good round of golf.  I got a good start, got a few birdies, got under par, hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, never really got in trouble.  The two dropped shots that I had, one was a three putt and was an up and down on 9, but I still should have given myself a chance to hole a putt for par.  Other than that it was a really good round of golf.
Q.  How difficult was the course playing?
PAUL McGINLEY:  Well, the course is playing firm and fast and there's wind, and I just hope it stays that way.  Unfortunately I don't think it's going to.  But it certainly gives guys like me an opportunity when it is firm and fast like this.

You know, the point that nobody seems to get, you know, is you don't have to have 8,000 yard long golf courses to make it difficult in terms of scoring.  I think you just have to have firm greens and a good set up and that's what we have this week.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PAUL McGINLEY:  Three putted it today, yeah.  Two bad bogeys.  I hit it in the middle of the green and had a 25 footer and jammed it by and missed the one coming back.
