  Q. What do you think?  
 PAUL McGINLEY: Of today?   
I played okay. Had a bad run on the back nine there. Drove it in two bunkers in a row and cost me two bogeys and there was a 3-putt. Other than that, one of those days. Didn't play particularly badly but when I made a mistake, it seemed to cost me a shot.  
  
  Q. And you're in the middle of all the other stuff, you're in the middle of The Ryder Cup as a vice captain, and in the middle of it right in the play. Were you having a look at what was going on?  
 PAUL McGINLEY: I was aware of it, yeah. It's great. It's great for the tournament and it's great for the Tour and it's great for the team that these guys are playing so well trying to make the team.   
  
  Q. It shows how much it means, Simon has is playing his heart out; Jimenez bogeys three holes in a row and bounces back; Edoardo, you can see what he's trying to do. It's exactly what you want, isn't it.   
 PAUL McGINLEY: It's great. Johnnie Walker sponsored this tournament, and to have this every second year, it's great that it's working out this way. And all credit to the boys for purchasing as hard as they can to make the team. So good luck to them. That's all I can say.  
  
  Q. Not sure it's going to make your discussions with the rest of the team any easier.   
 PAUL McGINLEY: Obviously there will be no decisions made tonight, there will be discussions tonight, but the final decision will be made tomorrow.
