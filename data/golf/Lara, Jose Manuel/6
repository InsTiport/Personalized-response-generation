   JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  If I tell you we really don't expect that, but I played with this guy the first two rounds, and he did play very straight, you know, from the tee and his putting is very good.   
 So he had a good round today, and I think it's good, you know, to have one of those guys winning these tournaments, and also for the Indian guys, I think it's very important.   
  
  Q.  I'd imagine it was frustrating for you, another round like yesterday with a lot of pars, a lot of good golf and the birdies just would not sink.   
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Well, I hit the ball maybe better today than yesterday.  I made a mistake on the 14th.  I was 1-under, and today, you know, I was 6-under total waiting for something, just make a birdie and then wait for the 18th and do something.  But nothing happened at the end.
