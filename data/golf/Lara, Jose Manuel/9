  Q.  Six birdies, no bogeys, was it as easy as it looked?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  No, only I hit my driver so good, and I hit many, many greens, probably 17 greens and putting was good.  That's the key probably.   
  
  Q.  Missed the cut in Abu Dhabi, 44th last week, is this the week the rust disappears?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  After Hong Kong I didn't play for probably a month.  I've been resting and you know, Abu Dhabi, that was my first week practising and playing.  I've been practising last two weeks and I feel better.   
  
  Q.  Long overdue first win there in Hong Kong, does that lift a terrific weight from your shoulders?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, definitely.  I play different.  I have to think of winning now.  Yeah, I probably get some confidence after that victory and now I'd like to be there.   
  
  Q.  Do you come into a tournament like this with all of the world stars playing here thinking you can win that?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  At the moment, it's the first round.  I'm 6-under and it's a very good score but there's three more rounds coming and the only thing is try to do the same.   
  
  Q.  What did you do after Hong Kong?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  I spent time with the family, you know, and I played a few tournaments in Spain, nothing special.  At Sergio's course, we made a very nice, friendly tournament.   
  
  Q.  Did you win?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, we play on the same team.  We won.   
  
  Q.  Now you've come out here, good start?   
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, today I played well, it's the first day, the last three weeks, my putting works good, I putted so bad.  I changed my putter the last three weeks.   
 Yeah, I feel okay.  I know the course.  I played here before and at the moment, 6-under is a really good score, a really good start.  But we will see, the tournament just started and I'd like to be there, anyway.
