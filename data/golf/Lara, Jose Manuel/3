 Q. 69 at Carnoustie, very good score. 
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Well, I played better the back nine. This year, I shot I think 5-under the front nine, 4-under, and then I struggled a little bit on the last few holes. I caught a couple of bunkers and made two up-and-downs.
 I finished the last few holes hitting the holes, also. 

 Q. The back nine, your best nine, you played particularly well there, getting the birdies on the card. 
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: I played good, and my putting works really good. So that's the way. 
 I'm happy with the score I made on the front nine. I'm happy with the results. I'm 12-under total. We will see tomorrow. 

 Q. Has that been the key to your week, the putting? 
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Yeah, I've been putting really good all the week. So my golf today has been so-so. The last few days is better than today. The putting has been working.

 Q. Three rounds under 70 on these courses. 
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Yeah, it's pretty good, for a Spanish guy, it's pretty good, we never play good in this weather. 

 Q. So back to St. Andrews tomorrow, and you're two shots off the lead looking like that at the moment, how do you feel about your chances?
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Well, I'm in good position. I'm right behind, just two shots from them, and we will see. I want to try to do my job and wait in the clubhouse.

 Q. Special place St. Andrews, to go there in contention at the top of the leaderboard. 
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Walking to the 18th green, 17 and 18 is a great corner and it's a great finish there. 

 Q. SOME big names at the top of the leaderboard, Rory, Darren, Paul McGinley, must be great to be amonst those.
 JOSÃ MANUEL LARA: Of course, it's going to be great, and you know, we will see. 
 I have no pressure. I'm just right behind them.
