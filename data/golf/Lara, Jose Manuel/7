   GORDON SIMPSON:  Well, José Manuel, very well played, and the worst of the weather, you got five holes as if you were going to drown today I think, but you must be very pleased would be joint leader with a round of 65. 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, definitely I played quite good today, yesterday as well, but the conditions as you said on the last five holes for me has been really tough.  You know, most of that, 16 and 18, I hit like -- I hit a driver and 5-wood in both. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Just suddenly like that, the course can become very, very difficult. 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, definitely.  It's a big change.  It's a big difference between the first nine holes I played today and 18 yesterday and the last -- from the last five holes I played today.  It's a big difference. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  You played the last six I think in 3-under par, didn't you.  The eagle really made a big move for you.  What happened there? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, definitely yesterday I make another one and No. 3, and today is my second eagle, as well.  Well, I holed a long putt and that maybe give to me the distance, you know on the greens.  And after that, I holed one on the 16th like ten metres for birdie.  I can't put the ball near in those conditions and I made the putt and it give me 10-under. 

 Q.  How long was the eagle putt? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  The same, ten metres downhill. 

 Q.Were you sure you would finish because of the rain? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  It was okay. The course drains so well and there was no thunder or lightning so it was okay. 

 Q. How much has it helped to have made the breakthrough by winning in Hong Kong? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA: Well, I've been injured for three months in my feet. I missed eight events from the Spanish Open but now I've played four in a row so maybe I am getting better and getting my game back. I feel this is a good course for me and I am looking for a second victory now. 

 Q. What was the problem with the injury? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA: It was my left Achilles. I was at home for two months. I didn't know how I did it. They said it was coming from the back and they did all tests and tried everything but the only guy who has made me feel much better is the Korean guy I know in Valencia where I live and he gave me some acupuncture. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  So you tried everything? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Yeah, that was the last thing, you know, I try and it works. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Which heel was it? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  The left. 

 Q.  Were you worried for going that long, that you might not be able to come back? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  The thing is, I know how the injury is going.  You know, I've been injured in 2001 for a year for my wrist, and then I know what's happening with that.  You have to give it time.  The thing is, you know, this one was different than the one in my wrist. To be honest I was desperate. I had tried everything and it didn't work. 
 So I know maybe I could play on the next three, four months.  The other one was really bad.  And at the moment, you know, I can't run or do anything in the gym, you know, with weights, you know.  But I can work, I can hit the ball in drills, and before I couldn't, so it's getting better. 

 Q.  How did you find out about this Korean guy? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Because somebody told me this guy, this Korean, he's a player as well, he's handicap three where I live, and to tell you the truth, I was, how do you say, desperate, you know.  Because nobody said to me what I have.  They said to me, you have inflammation in your Achilles and you have to take anti-inflammatories. 

 Q.  The acupuncture, is it on your back or on your ankle? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  In many places.  My hands, my thumbs, and also here in my arm, as well, neck.  So he put me like 15 needles. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  But none of them actually in the heel. 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  And also down there, once, he hit the spots -- he's really good.  He hit the spots, and also he did some low (ph) on the back of my knee they said it's for, to lose the tension, you know. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  How long did it take before you felt the difference?  Was it instantaneous? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  No, it was getting better.  He said to me:  "You're going to be better in two months if we do that every day."  He tell me every day when I'm going there, you are 85 now; 70, 60, and now I'm playing, he said that I'm 15 now, you know, 10. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  So you still have ten per cent to go yet? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Yes.  

 Q.  How much did it cost? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Good question.  I cannot tell you the answer because we -- it's difficult, you know, because we are good friends anyway.  So we make -- you know, I play with him a few days and we make a deal.  Anyway, we're going to be good friends. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  What is his name? 
 JOSÉ MANUEL LARA:  Cho is the name, just Cho. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Very interesting, see how you go tomorrow, José Manuel.
