   JOSE MANUEL LARA:  I feel good playing in India. Finished third three weeks ago and I am playing well again. Putting well on tough greens, difficult to read but I am happy with that. 

 Q.  Same kind of course to last time? 
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  It is the same in that you have to concentrate off the tee as the fairways are very hard and if you miss them it is very difficult to control the ball. Then putting, I am not sure which are tougher, here or Delhi, both are really hard to read and it is tough. 

 Q.  You were disappointed with the way things finished last time and the way Chowrasia came passed everyone? 
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  That is in the past and he played really well in the last round. It was a tough day and he did well and won. The only thing for me is this week t concentrate on myself and my own game. 

 Q.  Things are good generally? 
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  I have been changing a few things in the last week with Jos√©  Manuel Carriles, another Spanish player, and I am hitting the ball straighter and better. It is important to have someone who can explain how you can do it as he has been a player himself. It is good to have th0se checks. 

 Q.  And a good position to be in going into the weekend? 
 JOSE MANUEL LARA:  It is. Two behind so we will see.
