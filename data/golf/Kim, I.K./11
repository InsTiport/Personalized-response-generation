Q. How good of a feeling is it to be within one shot going into Sunday?
I.K. KIM: I think it's about the same as yesterday, but I feel really good about how I finished in the end, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. What is it about your game that has worked at this golf course for three days?
I.K. KIM: I think I've been very consistent with my drive and second shot.  It is kind of tricky to hit hybrids into the greens and all of a sudden hitting wedge into the greens.  That change was difficult.  But other than that, I feel really good about playing this golf course.  I've always liked this golf course.
Q. You're looking for your second win this season.  What would that mean to you, only one other player has won twice this season?
I.K. KIM: I didn't know that.  Well, I think it would be really fun to play great and win the tournament, you know?  But I really look forward to having an opportunity to play great golf.  The fans out here are really amazing, and I have really good friends, so I feel supported.
