Q. Just evaluate kind of your round today.
I.K. KIM: Well, it was a short night because we finished late afternoon, and then we teed off at 8:30.  Yeah, the front nine were really calm, not much wind today.  It got hotter on the back nine, but yeah, I hit the ball really well.  Like yesterday reading the greens was very tricky, so yeah, I'm just trying to figure it out.
Q. What do you feel was clicking for you today?  You were neck-and-neck with Gerina all day.
I.K. KIM: I think we all had a good, solid round, hitting the fairways and greens.  It's not easy to do here because the greens are very tiny, and then if you're in the right position, you always have a chance to make birdie.  And then Gerina putted very well from yesterday, so yeah, it's kind of exciting.
Q. How great is it to be in the position you are in heading into the weekend?
I.K. KIM: You know, I'm really pleased where I'm at.  I always love this golf course, so really look forward to the weekend.
