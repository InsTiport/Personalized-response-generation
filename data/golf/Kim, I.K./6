 Q.  5-under par bogey-free round.  What was working so well?  
I.K. KIM: I started off well.  I think 1 to 4 is into the wind so it is kind of tough to be aggressive, but I manage it pretty well.  I got up and down on 11 today, so that helped.   
 Q.  How did you find the course playing today compared to yesterday?  
I.K. KIM: I don't know, about the same.  I think today a little bit softer.  I think last night there was some rain.   
But the course is in really good shape.  I think I hit the ball better yesterday but today I putted better.   
 Q.  You had quite a bit of rest coming into this event.  How do you feel your game is right now?  
I.K. KIM: Like I was talking to all my friends, and I feel like I'm just beginning of the season, not end of it.   
But I feel really good.  I had a good year.  It's always nice to finish here because I didn't get to play last year.  I got really sick and I didn't play.   
I feel really good to be here this week.   
 Q.  What would need to happen this weekend for you to consider this a success?  
I.K. KIM: Just staying what I been working on coming output.  It's kind of like out the seed in and then see what's coming out.  Kind of harvesting what I've been working on.   
So it's a lot of learning process, but like I said, the course is in good condition, so it's kind of fun to play.
