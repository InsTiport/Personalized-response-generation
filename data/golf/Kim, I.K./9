 Q.  What a scintillating round of golf today, eight birdies, 8-under, you left the rest of the field in the dust.  You've got to tell me what your impressions were today and how you managed to start off so well.  
I.K. KIM: I wish I had the answer, but I really don't.  Yeah, I mean, I always liked the golf course, and only the change was 18, and I come back.  I had a playoff before, and I just have great memory, and what a No. 2, that par-3, getting up-and-down on that par-3 gave me -- having a chance to go for a good round of golf.   
 Q.  What does that do for you, resetting your goals for the rest of the year?  
I.K. KIM: Again, you know, it's golf.  I really didn't expect anything.  Maybe I think that's why I played really well today.  Everybody was -- really good names are on top of the leaderboard, and I just wanted to go out and make the most out of it, and today I was able to do that.
