   JAMES NITTIES:  Solid round. Hit 16 greens and didn't hole any long greens. It was pretty easy out there. I have been playing well for the last couple of months, but to being healthy and confident in my game. The course seems to suit me, I missed only two greens, so it wasn't too stressful out there. 
 This is my third year as a professional and I got injured during the first year and put me out for the best part of eight months and the next six months were about getting my health back. Last year was pretty much when I was on top of my health issue and playing good golf. Now it's good to be back on the course and playing well. I was worried about the chain reaction from the health  problems. 
I had a form of arthritis, so I was hospitalised for 6 weeks and in bed for 8 weeks after that. It wasn't fun and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. It's just good to be back to normal. It started in my hip and came from nowhere. I was playing in the Nationwide Tour and it came on me in three days. It works through the body through fluid building up in joints and it took 3 weeks to diagnose it. It wasn't fun. You are a fit 22 year old and in hospital for four months and you haven't even broken a bone. 
 It's a bit of a weird one, but there are people worse off than me and I just have to make the best of it and be positive. I can't have too many big nights out. If I keep the immune system healthy I should have no ill effects. I am on light medication and my specialist said he is 80 per cent certain it won't return.
