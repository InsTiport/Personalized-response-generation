  Q. James, you put yourself in position and gave yourself a chance. Isn't too much more you can ask for.   
 JAMES NITTIES: Yeah, in the end it was a good week. I take a lot of positives out of it. Pretty disappointed at the end because I felt like I was hitting it really well today and some wasted shots on the two par-5s coming in. But you know, what are you going to do? I had a good week, and hopefully I can draw from this and take it into the rest of the year.  
  
  Q. Big par save on 16. You must have felt a little bit at that time like, okay, I'm still okay. Talk me through 17.   
 JAMES NITTIES: It was fortunate to make par on 16, and 17, me and my caddie talked about the spot where I'd hit it right of the green, which was a good spot. Obviously I didn't hit the green, I hit it out there, and I felt really confident in myself within five, ten feet for a birdie, and I was probably just a little bit nervous. I didn't want to be too conservative, and I was a bit too aggressive and knocked it past. Then at the top there it's like a cricket pitch, it's lightning fast. I felt like I hit a good putt. The first time it went about ten feet by, then hit a great putt the next one and just broke a bit farther than I thought. So very disappointing. Obviously it's all said and done now, so I've got to take it.  
  
  Q. How much confidence is this going to give you going into the rest of the year now knowing you can put yourself in position when you're playing the kind of golf you know how to play?  
 JAMES NITTIES: I mean, tons of confidence. I've sort of proven to myself that I'm meant to be out here. I felt like I should have won by a couple out there. That's how I was hitting it. It's sort of made me realize that I'm worthy of playing on the PGA TOUR.
