  Q. It was a tough start but a nice comeback to finish off with a nice round of 2-under par 69 and 8-under total.   
 JAMES NITTIES: No, it wasn't the ideal start that I was looking for, but fortunately my caddie kept me composed. I've been playing well the last couple weeks, so I just need to keep doing that. In the end I ended up finishing pretty well.  
  
  Q. When you came out with that start with a bogey on 11 and a bogey on 12, what did you tell yourself?  
 JAMES NITTIES: Well, first of all, all I wanted to do was hit a good drive down the next and get birdie, and I actually got lucky, I hung up against a hedge and made a good birdie and sort of stopped the bleeding a little bit and then managed to hit a good couple of shots on the next. Then birdied 15, 16, and 16 was probably the highlight that kept me going to get back in the tournament. Yeah, it wasn't a good start, but in the end it was good.  
  
  Q. You were playing in the dark there, you make birdie at No. 8, and then what an up-and-down there at 9 out of the front bunker.   
 JAMES NITTIES: I got lucky on that one there, actually hit the cart path -- it was going right of the green, hit the cart path and went in the bunker and bounced left. I nearly holed it, but I got really lucky on that hole. It was lucky I parred in.   
 Obviously if I just play well the last couple days, I think I can do well.  
  
  Q. After last week missing the cut by one, does it feel good to get your first cut under your belt?  
 JAMES NITTIES: Yeah, I said to my caddie afterwards, "weekends are sweet." You know, I've been playing well, so it was about time, and to be near the lead is even better.
