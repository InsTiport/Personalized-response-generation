  Q. Just take me through the round, maybe some high points of it.   
 JAMES NITTIES: Yeah. I really struck it really solidly yesterday. It was quite windy, and I felt comfortable with my game. I still missed a couple really short putts. It's a funny way to put it, but I'm positive to know that I missed a couple short putts and I'm still shooting 6-under because I'm holing a couple nice ones as well.   
 Yesterday I was confident. Today we came out here and it's perfect conditions. The greens are rolling beautifully, and yeah, it's actually perfect scoring conditions. So there's going to be some good ones in this morning. But yeah, the second round was solid.  
  
  Q. That's what I was going to ask you next. The course is holding up pretty well despite all the water we've had?  
 JAMES NITTIES: Yeah. They've done a fantastic job. I heard they've been working throughout the night. It's actually surprising how much dryer it is. It's still very wet out there, but it's getting to the point where we don't need to take it 15 yards to get out of casual water.   
 No, the course is beautiful. You know, you think a couple nice days like this and we'll be back to normal.  
  
  Q. Plan for the next two rounds?  
 JAMES NITTIES: Just keep doing what I'm doing. Pretty cliche, but I think we're going to go back to the hotel because I don't think we're going to tee off till about 3:00.   
 No, I feel good with my game. I'm just looking forward to getting out there and playing well.   
  
  Q. Perfect.
