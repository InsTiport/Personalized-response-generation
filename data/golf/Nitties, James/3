  Q. Bogey-free 5-under, 67 today. You got to be really encouraged about tomorrow.  
 JAMES NITTIES: Yeah, definitely. I didn't know what to expect out here today because I've been laying on my bed for about 24 hours yesterday and I -- just one of those days you wanted to go out there and just, you know, just hit some half decent shots and get around. I found a groove out there and ended up finishing pretty well.  
  
  Q. What did you do yesterday? We didn't ask you. Movies? Were you literally just playing around?  
 JAMES NITTIES: We decided to go to the movies and then it was even an effort to get to the movies because the thunderstorms were crazy. We went and saw Robin Hood.   
 It's one of those days you try to go kill time. I think I spent three hours on the Internet just doing nothing.  
  
  Q. What are you most pleased with as far as your game goes right now?  
 JAMES NITTIES: My game has been great all year. I've just been really streaky with the putter and confident. As I said, I've been playing well so this isn't a surprise to me.   
 I didn't really hole any huge putts. I holed the putts you should do. It's one of those things, I finally got that little bit of confidence back and good to be out there around the lead.  
  
  Q. Finally, tomorrow is, obviously, going to be a long day, 36 holes.  
 JAMES NITTIES: You know, it brings back the old amateur golf days playing 36 holes. We've already done it twice this year in Puerto Rico and felt pretty good there. I'm pretty fit so obviously that's going to help. But, yes, it's one of those days you get one of those early rounds in the house and try to go out and compete well in the afternoon.
