  Q. Can you talk about your round a little bit, and what went well and key holes?   
 BECKY MORGAN: Sure, I got off to a good start. Birdied the first and second, made it close on the first and hit a good par on the second. I think I only maybe missed one or two greens on the front, and birdied 8 and 9, shot some good birdies. 8 is that long par-3 so I'll take 3 on that every day so two is nice.   
 I played well on the back. I hit a couple of scrappy shots, obviously the one on 18 I didn't really like. But all in all I hit a lot of greens and rolling the ball well.  
  
  Q. On 18, even though it wasn't the greatest shot, you were able to kind of save bogey there. Kind of just take me through that hole, if you would?  
 BECKY MORGAN: I pulled my second shot left of the bunker, and pretty much didn't have much hope with my third but tried to hit a big flop shot over the bunker and probably should have just taken, you know, taken bogey and hit it farther on and two-putted. But I was trying to get a little cute with it.   
 Almost fell off, but it just caught the top of the bunker and came back. Then hit a good bunker shot. Didn't like the sand there, so I didn't have much room to work with. But I hit a good shot two feet to knock it in so...  
  
  Q. Everybody was talking about the great scoring conditions and the greens were really receptive. Were you finding that still today?   
 BECKY MORGAN: Yeah, the greens are perfect this morning. And you can fire at most of the pins. The greens are -- there are a few tricky ones -- most of them are relatively flat. So if you're in the fairway, you can pretty much go at most of the pins. So I think the leaders score will be pretty low today.
