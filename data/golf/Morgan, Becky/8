THE MODERATOR:  Welcome, Becky.  Thanks for joining us.  You've had a good year this year.  Ready for the Weetabix British Open this week.  Talk about how you feel coming into this week.
BECKY MORGAN:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  I just played 18.  The course is in really good shape, so it should be a really good week.
THE MODERATOR:  Can you talk a little bit about the course.
BECKY MORGAN:  It's pretty much the same as last time we were here.  I think they moved a few tees back.

But the greens are in great shape, pretty hard.  Fairways are quite bouncy, not as bouncy as they can be.  Overall it's in really good (inaudible).
THE MODERATOR:  We'll open it up for questions.
Q.  Are you in any way surprised by (inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Not really because actually I last year had just as good of a year last year.  Actually this point last year, I was in about the same position on the Money List.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Actually maybe even higher.  It's pretty much very similar years.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No (laughter).  I've been in contention a couple of times this year, which I really wasn't last year.  I had some good finishes but was never really in touch.

So this year has been good for me to, you know, I think I can win a tournament basically.
Q.  (Inaudible) case of just taking each week as it comes?
BECKY MORGAN:  Obviously, being British, the British Open would be 'the' tournament I would like to win.  So it's really important for me to play well here, yeah.  I took a couple weeks off before Evian so I'd be fresh for this week, yeah.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  I think it depends which ones you talk to.  Obviously, I think the top players understand it's a major and really want to do well here.  I know some don't come over.

I think, yeah, they all take it very seriously.
Q.  Do you ever get frustrated by a lack of recognition?  You're doing great things, competing with the best in the world, going around the world, and aren't necessarily in the public eye.  Do you feel a frustration there that you don't get recognized?
BECKY MORGAN:  Sometimes, yeah.  Yeah, I guess it actually happens throughout my career, amateur and professional.  It actually doesn't surprise me.

But, yeah, I sometimes feel like I should    I'm a very consistent player.  I don't think    obviously, I'm just not a very flashy player.  I think the media in particular likes, you know, the Laura Davies of the world, which is great.  But sometimes it annoys me a little bit.
Q.  Consistently winning two or three or four tournaments a year might change things, whether you're flashy or not?
BECKY MORGAN:  Yeah, I agree.  I'm not saying    I'm just    I mean I agree, winning is the key to being in the newspapers.

But, yeah, even in TV coverage, I don't think    in tournaments I've been in contention in the States, I haven't really featured.  That would be what I'd be basing it on.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Yes.
Q.  Do you always wear that?
BECKY MORGAN:  It's just this year I've done it.  Just put it on.
Q.  Is that a sponsor?
BECKY MORGAN:  Oh, no, no.
Q.  Do you have any new sponsors?
BECKY MORGAN:  No.  I mean, obviously there's not a huge amount of big companies in Wales.  It would be nice to be sponsored by a Welsh company.  Obviously, a lot are trying to get into the States.

But, yeah, I just put the dragon on because I'm proudly Welsh.
Q.  (Inaudible) contention?
BECKY MORGAN:  No.  No favorite shirt (laughter).
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Well, I guess it's natural that they show their own players.  I'm just basing it on I guess it's family feedback.  I just have been     Atlanta    well, Sybase was on TV, but Atlanta didn't feature that heavily on the coverage.  I actually had a putt to tie the victory.

Yeah, they support their own, so it's fair enough.
Q.  Who are your clothing sponsors.
BECKY MORGAN:  Moose (phonetic).  He's actually a Welsh guy.  He has a stand here this week.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No, no problem.  I'm just saying    like probably part of me likes being not in the limelight.  But I obviously grew up playing amateur golf with some amateurs who were in the news a lot, and I just kind of cruised under the radar, which is fine.

Just my point was that I'm just used to not being in the limelight.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Yeah, I mean, it's always nice to get recognition for your golf, yeah.
Q.  How do you feel having The Ryder Cup (inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  I don't think it's had a huge impact.  I guess the few years before it will, but I haven't really noticed anything that's different.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No, no.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Yes.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  It was a few years ago.  They just said they were putting their money into other things basically.
Q.  Have you ever been back since?
BECKY MORGAN:  Always trying, yeah.  But they obviously aren't interested.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  You'll have to ask him.  I'm not sure.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  IMG.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  I have no idea actually.  I've never met the guy, so I'm not sure.
Q.  What clubs are you using these days?
BECKY MORGAN:  TaylorMade.
Q.  Have you got the new driver?
BECKY MORGAN:  The seven series, yeah.
Q.  How long have you had that?
BECKY MORGAN:  I think I put it in the bag last week actually.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  None.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  I just have it set up for a draw.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No, yeah, I actually    I just put it in.  It doesn't really make a huge difference.  That's the way I liked it, so...
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No, she's not.  I just stayed with her the last few days, but she's going to be away for the Thursday through Sunday.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BECKY MORGAN:  Yeah, she does.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  No, she works for Walker's Crisps.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
BECKY MORGAN:  Yeah, she's working in the marketing side.  Something I don't understand.
THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
