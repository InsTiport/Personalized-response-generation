 Q.   Could I just have your reaction coming in?   You're currently placed third.  
BECKY MORGAN:   Yeah.   I was really happy.   I struggled on the front nine and then made four birdies on the last five holes, I think, to make it a decent finish.   So I was having a few issues on the front, wasn't playing very well.   And I played better on the Back 9 all week, so I just thought if I could just hit some more fairways and greens, make a few putts, I could get some birdies, so it worked out really well.  
   
 Q.   You've been consistently good in this tournament as well.   That must be pretty pleasing.   
BECKY MORGAN:   Yeah.   It's a great event, one of the better events we have on the European tour.   The golf course is always in great shape.   So if you're a decent putter, the greens are always really good.   If you get if on line, they can go in quite a lot, so I putted really well this week, so I've been happy with that.  
   
 Q.   So is there a case when you look back ‑‑ obviously you (inaudible).   Something you look back at?  
BECKY MORGAN:   Absolutely.   Lexi did the same thing in Alabama this year when she was in the lead, she kind of went forward and didn't look back.   So she would have been so tough to catch today.   
I mean I started the day in fifth, and I'm third, so pretty happy with that.
