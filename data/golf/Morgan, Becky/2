  Q. Talk about your round. Tell me how the day went.   
 BECKY MORGAN: Well, I started off and holed my second shot on 1, so I had a good start. Then I made a couple -- I was a little scrappy today and didn't putt as well.   
 Made a few bogeys and stuff, so generally hit it better the last two days than I did today, but I hung in there. Going to try and have a low score tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Even for the day; Thompson is at minus 15; you're at minus 8. Do you have a shot?  
 BECKY MORGAN: Lexi played great today, so I will have to play really well. You know, anything can happen in this game. The way she played today was really impressive.   
 So just going to go out and play my game tomorrow, hopefully make some putts like I did the first two days and make some birdies, because birdies kind of dried up today.  
  
  Q. Thompson is young. Describe her game today. What made it good?  
 BECKY MORGAN: She hits it absolutely miles. She hit it really straight today, so, I mean, she has wedge into a lot of the par 4s, which is huge around here. And she putted great, so it was very impressive.  
  
  Q. So she's going to be tough to take tomorrow, but doable still, right?  
 BECKY MORGAN: Yeah, I mean, who knows. This game is kind of crazy sometimes. She played great. Someone is going to have to play really well to beat her tomorrow, but you never know.
