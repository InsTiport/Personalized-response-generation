THOMAS LEVET:  We played really well all day from tee-to-green, but couldn't make a putt until the very last hole.  At least we got that one to make absolutely sure of third place.  This is the second time we've played together and at least Raphael and I are going in the right direction, finishing third this time after being eighth last year.

RAPHAEL JACQUELIN:  It's disappointing not to have gotten second place.  This is the second time France has been beaten by England today.  We lost the Rugby World Cup semi final to England and now they've taken second place from us in this tournament.  It's been a good week all around.  We tried to put some pressure on South Africa today, but they never made any real mistakes and it was always the case of trying to chase second place.  We didn't quite make it but third is a good achievement.
