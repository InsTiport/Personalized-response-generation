 Q. Good start, nice weather?
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Good start, nice weather. If the wind picks up and the rain is coming, this is the place you don't want to play really. It's always a bit more difficult when the conditions are difficult. 

 Q. Is there a random element to this tournament? 
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, you need to be lucky -- if you want to finish well, you have to play well of course, but you need a bit of luck. It's supposed to be bad tomorrow and we are playing Carnoustie. 
 Very happy with my game. Not too much mistakes, good strategy. It was great. It was good fun, as well, with the amateur, he's nice. We had good fun.
