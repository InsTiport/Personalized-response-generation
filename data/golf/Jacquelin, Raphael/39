  Q.  Tell us about a good day?   
 RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: I played really well, especially the back nine where I had a lot of chances. But I made a good 30 foot putt for eagle on the 14th which was my big move of the day. The front nine was not easy into the wind especially after the double bogey at the second. Really that was the only shot I missed today, I was in a bush and made double but that is this golf course for you.   
  
  Q.  You said you had chances, are you frustrated not to have scored better?   
 RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: A little bit but I played well. I hit the ball well and maybe this is good for the weekend, I will keep all the birdie putts for the weekend. But it is not easy to putt, you have to stroke the ball perfectly to have a chance and that is never easy. But we will try again tomorrow and try and stay in contention with the leaders.   
  
  Q.  Is this a course you feel more comfortable on the more you play it?   
 RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: For sure. I played with the Indian player Singh today and knows the course well and he does not have to think about which club to hit or where the wind is coming from, he knows. So I have two rounds to come and I hope I get to play with another Indian player in those so he can tell me the secrets of the course!
