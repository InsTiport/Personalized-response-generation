  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Very happy, it was a big crowd, they were cheering for me, I mean, from the tee to the green on every hole.   It was like the U.S. Open a little bit.   
It was great, and I'm very happy to be in this position, even if I didn't win the tournament.   But I think there's no regret.   
   
 Q.   You certainly gave yourself a chance?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, but I think Marcel deserves it, the way he's playing at the moment, and the way he started the year, I think he deserved to win.   So I try my best.   He was better than me.   
   
 Q.   Did you enjoy that adulation with thousands upon thousands cheering your name?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, that was fantastic, that's for sure.   
I did pretty well, actually.   Made some birdies and some bogeys as well, but saving the pars, and on 18, it was very good to make four.   I like that.   That was a good way to finish.   
I'm ready for the next two weeks.   I've got big weeks to come.
