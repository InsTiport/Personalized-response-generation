  STEVE TODD:   Many thanks for joining us.   Nice way to start the year, isn't it?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I come here every day if you want.   
STEVE TODD:   Talk us through the round.   No signs of rust I'm gathering?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     Yeah, well, on the second tee‑‑ it's not that long but it was playing long‑‑ and you don't want to go every day with a 5‑iron.   Like I said, it was tough, the crosswinds very strong compared to the first two days.   But I managed to get everything right, bogey‑free round, which that was the key, to go every round bogey‑free on this course.   
It's a new year, pretty good for me to start, so that's great.   
STEVE TODD:   Take us through a couple of the highlights from the round.  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     On 6, I started pretty well, hitting the ball well, hit a lot of greens.   The birdie on 6, I holed, what, maybe four metres to the hole, pretty straight putt.   
8, the par5, hit a short par 5 short of the pin, in the crosswind and a bit down as well so I had a 3‑wood and 8‑iron.   Again, if you manage to hit the ball‑‑ the key on the par5, which again is the key of the week because you're going to have to make a lot of birdies if you want to stay up there.   So 8‑iron on the par5 and then I just missed the green on the right, and almost holed a chip.   That was a chip‑and‑run.   
Then 14, a long drive and I had a 7‑iron to the green, almost behind the tree on the right, and I kept a 3‑iron just short left of the green, two putts from ten metres.   
Then 17 and 18, not a long hole, but I hit wedge, and I had 27 metres to the pin.   And then tried to cross a bit down but strong with a wedge, especially with a good lie, I managed to get it just short left.  
Hit a great tee shot on 18, 3‑wood and pitched to the middle of the green.   I don't know if it hit the grandstand and came back.   It pitched almost pin‑high, but because it's quite an easy chip from the back of the green‑‑ and then I almost holed a chip, as well, on 18.   So short game was ready and long game, as well.   
   
 Q.   A lot of French courses have similar conditions‑‑  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     I don't know, but again, yeah, I'm better when the conditions are difficult.   I don't feel any better when there's in wind but the way it is, I score better when it's difficult, the wind or the rain or whatever the condition is, or if the course is difficult, like playing the Majors like the U.S. Open.   
Yeah, I like it when it's tough.   Stay focused all day long and I know if you save par, you are always going to be around.   That's the way I like to play.   
   
 Q.   And how many times did you take driver today?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     That's a good question.   The first one was a par 5, No. 3.   Then No. 5, the par 4, 9, 10, 11, 14, the par5, and that's it.   The wind direction was pretty much the same, maybe not at beginning, and then it switched a little bit and was stronger the same direction.   I think it was pretty much the same kind of drive off the tee.   
   
 Q.   How do you find the greens?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     They were better today.   They were better‑‑ they were faster, firmer of course, because it didn't rain last flight.   The first few chips were strong compared to the first two days, so if it doesn't rain, apparently it's bouncy and you have to keep the ball on the green, especially with the long irons.   Again, short course, so if you manage to putt the ball in play, you'll have a chance for birdie.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     It was difficult on Tuesday, but again, everything was better.   The breeze a bit cooler, so that was better.   I think that's okay‑‑ I'm fit, it's okay.   It's not too bad.  
   
 Q.   How many times have you played this course?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     I can't remember which year was it that I played a long time ago.   
   
 Q.   South African Open?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     Probably, yeah.   But I didn't play two years ago.   
   
 Q.   Is this the kind of golf course you've got to get to know or is it a thinking man's course?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:     I think it's more thinking.   It's tricky but if you stay focused‑‑ it's wide off the tee.   You always have like 40 metres to putt the ball in play, which is pretty good for us, but it's just the vision of all the trees and the bushes around it make the course difficult.   But if you just trust yourself and don't try to guide the ball because then it's over.   It's hard to be relaxed, like every day.   
STEVE TODD:   Thank you very much.
