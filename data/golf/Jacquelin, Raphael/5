 Q.  How was it out there for you today?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It was great.  It was really pleasant as you can see.  There's not a lot of wind today and the course is playing -- you can score really low, we know that, but you still have to do it.  I finish 11-under, even though I made a mistake like that, but a thing like that can happen any time.  I'm pleased to be 11-under after two rounds.   
 Q.  What was key factor for you today?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I played pretty solid, the long game, since yesterday.  Put the ball in play quite long.  I managed to hit the par 5 in two, pretty much every par 5, that helps.  And for the rest, stayed patient and got solid contact on the irons and that's what I'm going to try to do for the weekend, because it's like a birdie festival, so you have to be on the green first to make birdies.   
 Q.  Obviously your aim is to possibly get in the Top 60 for the final three tournaments?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, always been, since 20 years on the Tour.  I've played quite a lot in the Top 60.  Yeah, it's always a goal.  But step by step, let's play tomorrow and we'll see after that.   
 Q.  Obviously you have the Open de EspaÃ±a in the bag.  How much would you like to add to it?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It would be great to win another one.  But like I said, two more days and a lot of birdies to go.
