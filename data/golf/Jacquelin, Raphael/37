  Q. Three excellent rounds of golf, you're No. 1 in greens in regulation coming today?  
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Is it? Great. I'm happy to talk to you, it's always a good sign, first of all and I'm happy to play pretty well these first three rounds after three months of not playing so good.   
 So happy to be here and as you said, yes, I played, I hit the ball pretty straight and pretty consistent, so that's why I'm leading the greens in regulation and maybe the fairways, but still have to hole a few putts. I had a lot of chances today. But I think it's the same for everyone. It's difficult to read the greens and to get the right pace. The greens are a little bit slow. So we have to give it a chance sometime, but we'll try tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You mentioned the last three months have not been up to normal standard; what's been the problem?  
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I had a difficult two months, three months ago. I lost my best friend of my father, so it was not so easy to come back on the Tour. I wanted to play but was not focused on the game I think too much. But it's getting better, and the way I hit the ball, it's giving me some good pleasure so that's the main thing.  
  
  Q. Last few holes out there today seemed to be playing quite differently.   
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, definitely, into the wind, 16, I don't know what the guy hit, but missed my drive on the right so it was a rescue from the rough for me but I think 3- or 4-iron to get in and then another 3-iron for me on 17, couldn't reach the 18th today, so tough finish, but the greens are soft, the fairways are soft, so if you hit the ball fairly straight, you're going to be able to give you some chances for birdie.
