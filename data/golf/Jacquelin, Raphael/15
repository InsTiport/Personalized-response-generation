  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Crazy round for a crazy game.   Yeah, I've been struggling the last month, the last two months, really, with my game.   Didn't feel really well, no confidence, nothing.   So it was not easy to start this Final Series with no confidence.   
But starting on this week, I was feeling a bit better, the rhythm was back, especially for me it was my key.   I hit some better shots and more on line, so I hit more fairways and more greens, and today, I mean, everything was together I would say.   
So yes, even with a double‑bogey on 5, the rest was incredible and I had a lot of chances and I made it.   So it's happy days.   
   
 Q.   And four birdies in a row on three occasions, 12 all told, that's equalling a European Tour record, that's something to be proud of?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, I'm proud of it.   I have a few records on Tour.   I made eight birdies in a row a long time ago.   I know I can score a little bit.   I don't know where was it, but it is back, so I'm very pleased with it.  
   
 Q.   I daresay you were conscious of scoring well.   Are you conscious of where you've put yourself on that leaderboard suddenly?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Oh, I don't even look at the leaderboard.   At the moment, I was struggling, so even if you are like 5‑ , 6‑under, 7‑under, it doesn't matter.   Just try to stay focused on my game and do my best, because, you know, this game, it's not that easy to stay up there, even when everything is going in.   
So no, just focus on my game, I know how to do it, so when I'm in contention, normally I do pretty well, so I'll try to stay in the same rhythm at the beginning and finish well.   
So now I'm good to be up there, but there's a lot of chances for birdies at the back, as well, but I'll be ready for tomorrow.
