Q. Congratulations, your 600th event on the European Tour.  How does it feel to reach that milestone?
RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: Thank you.  I still feel young, actually, so I'm all right.  I know it's a lot of tournaments.  I can see that.  I can feel it sometimes.  But I'm still enjoying myself to be on Tour, so that's the most important, so I keep on going.
Q. 1997 you graduated from the Challenge Tour.  Did you envisage making 600 appearances?
RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: No, no idea at that time for sure, but I always wanted to do some sport at a high level, so I played golf, and made the right choice apparently.
Q. From the previous 599, what's been the biggest standout moment for you in your career?
RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: Of course the first win in Madrid in 2005, but I have to say I made eight birdies in a row in Saint Cyprien, it was '95, first time for the pre-qualifying school I think it was.  I mean, eight birdies to qualify to the final stage, and then from there, I managed to get a category on the Challenge Tour and played well in '96.  Eight birdies in a row to come back in the final, that was impressive, and that was the key of my career, I think.
Q. 71 to start this tournament.  Obviously the Rolex Series is something that's happened in the last few years, and you who have been on the Tour a long time must appreciate their role and what they do for the game?
RAPHAEL JACQUELIN: Oh, yeah, we all know we have to be ready for this Rolex Series, and yeah, it's a fantastic venue, always been a fantastic venue here in Abu Dhabi, but to be a Rolex Series now, it's even more important for us.  71, yeah, still happy to be under par.  It was perfect weather this morning, soft greens and not very windy at all.  Yeah, still under par, so I'm happy with it.
