 Q.   You gave the French fans who were here today something to smile about, were you pleased?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Very pleased to play under par today.   I said that at the beginning of the week, any score under par would be good.   I'm happy with that.   I hit the ball great, solid as the first two days.   Very pleased with it.   
   
 Q.   And the forecasting wind for tomorrow, maybe even quite strong winds, are you happy with that?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I don't know.   I don't know if I have to be happy with that.   But I'll deal with it, anyways.   
So I'm going to try exactly the same that I did the first three days and hit as many fairways as I can.   And if not, I'll lay up and try to save par.   That was the strategy for the week, so take the same plan.  
   
 Q.   Did you have any interaction with the French fans here today?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, I had a few, it was great to see the public coming, even if the weather was not very good.   I hope they are going to be there a lot tomorrow and support me.   I will try to do my best, and we'll see.  
   
 Q.   What does it mean for a French man to win this?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   It means a lot.   Jean‑FranÃ§ois RemÃ©sy   wins twice, Thomas won one.   So, yeah, anything is possible.   It's like a fifth major for us.   And so it would mean a lot but don't want to put too much pressure.   The course is putting a lot of pressure on myself already.   So I will try to do my best again on the course.
