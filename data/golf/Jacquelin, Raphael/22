 Q.   Competitive back nine?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Good come back, five birdies in a row from 13 to 17.   Had a good chance on 18, just missed.   Difficult 2‑putt.   
Very glad to come back like this.   I think I played well yesterday on the back nine as well, 3‑under.   
I stayed patient all day long.   The feeling was not so good at the beginning, but that's the game, it's always like this.   You have to be patient and any time you can come back.   At the end, the feeling was better.   I'm going to grab something to eat and go back to the range to keep this feeling.   
   
 Q.   How was the course out there for you?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   The course is great.   Yeah, the course is interesting.   It's not easy at all.   It blows a little bit and then it gets tricky from the tee.   And the second shot to the green, even if it's not that long, it's not playing that long because we are not playing from the back tee.   It's difficult to get really close.   
It's nice, it's a good first week for me.   It's great to start with a week like that, only 35 players and you are sure you are going to play four rounds and then you are going to be ready for the next three other ones.   
   
 Q.   How was it playing with the amateur, quite nice change from the norm?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   It was great.   The guy we played with was from South America.   He played very well.   I think he enjoyed, finished 14‑under, which is good, but not enough to beat Retief and Lee Slattery, but it was good fun.   We had a good day.
