RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It's a tough day for everybody, but at least the weather is supposed to be all right tomorrow and we'll be able to play 72 holes for the tournament.  That's the most important.
It's going to be a long day for us at the end, because it's going to be 36 holes, but if we can play, it's okay.  It's a day of rest and we'll see tomorrow.
Q. You didn't get a chance to actually hit a ball today, but you've had a little look around, that course is saturated, isn't it?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It is.  It is wet when we arrived, but I think it did pretty well this morning.  That's what I heard from the players who played a few holes today.
But no, it was really too early to start, and well, I saw this morning from the hotel, it was really, really heavy.  Nothing to do about it.
Q. You sense you'll get the benefit of having some time off?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, resting, it's always good.  Like I said, it's going to be a long tomorrow, but if we get a bit of sunshine, it will be good for everyone, for the crowd and for the players.
