Q. Fantastic round.
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It is fantastic.  Very pleased.  Better than yesterday.  Today it was easier with the conditions but still a bit of wind and gust, as well.
Yeah, I didn't start very well, but I managed to save some good pars with the putter.  So it makes a big difference to continue the round.  After that, I played well and I holed some putts, so it's great.  Another good day.
Q. You must be doubly pleased, coming from the wrong side of the draw, if you like.
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: You know, what I've been on Tour since 20 years, so I know exactly how it goes, and sometimes it's on your side and sometimes not.  Yeah, it was difficult to see the guys stopping to play yesterday, but that wasn't playable.  So there was not even a chance you continue to play.
But yeah, 6-under today makes me happy for sure.
Q. What is the most pleasing aspect of your game out there?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I putted very well actually I have to say.  I'm reading the greens well and putting well.  The rest is solid.  Not perfect but it's never perfect.  I hit it solid, and had a good chance on the back nine, as I said, and I made it.
Q. Obviously a lot of golf to finish out; the guys won't get done tonight.  But you feel you're really in this tournament, don't you?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, I just saw the leaderboard and Sergio is way in front, but you never know.  I'm not that far back, and I'm going to try my best, exactly as I did today, and if I play like this, there's another good score to shoot tomorrow.
