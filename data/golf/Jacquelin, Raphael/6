 Q.  How good is 5-under par to start around St. Andrews?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It is always good.  Under par in these conditions, even if it's the front nine is playing downwind, so it's a little bit more easier, but you still have to make the putts and make the birdies.   
Yeah, I'm very pleased with 5-under par.  The back nine is tough.  Got some tough shots to play but managed to shoot 1-under par the back nine, so yeah, very happy with that.   
 Q.  In many ways, this is a pleasant day but it's kind of cold and that wind is tricky?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: It's not too bad.  I have to say it's pretty good actually, even if it's a bit cold, we've got everything to wear, but that's not too bad.  It could be a lot stronger and a lot cooler.  I can't complain.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts of playing in a team event, different rhythm to what you do usually?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: That was pretty quick today, by chance, I don't know why, but it was quicker than the other years.   It's good to play as a team.  We started pretty well with 7-under par as a team, so let's continue like this and let's try to be in position to play the weekend.
