Q.   Tell us about a very neat and tidy round that's given you a lovely position on this leaderboard?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, I've been playing well this week.   So I know the course pretty well.   It can be tricky but you've got a lot of birdie position if you put the ball in play.   So that's makes it a really big difference if you can be in the fairway because you've got some short irons to the greens, but if you are in the semi‑rough, you're in the semi rough or rough, you can get a big flyer and it's difficult to putt it on the green.
So yeah, I've been hitting a lot of fairways, and yeah, I played really well.

Q.   Tends to set up well with the length and strategy that's involved?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, what you saw, yeah, it's great.   I mean, I know exactly what I have to do and like I said, and for the rest, as usual, try to be patient and try to hole some putts on these greens.   They are pretty good, pretty fast.   Could be really fast down the grain, down the hill but rolling the ball really well.   So you have to just be patient, again, but as usual. 

Q.   Feeling good about the game in general terms? 
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   So‑so.   Sometimes it's getting a bit difficult this year.   I'm not doing my best here but it's not over for us so I'm going to fight till the end.   And for the rest, yeah, not so patient.   As I said, you have to be patient.   It's a bit frustrating when you know you can do it and you're not doing it.   But that's golf. 

Q.   It does sound like there have been frustrations and annoyances of trying to work hard and still not seeing the results?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   We are all the same.   I'm not the only one.   We are all trying to do our best and if you are not patient, you are not going to do it, so that's another key.
