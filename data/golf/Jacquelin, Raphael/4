 Q.  Talk about that round.  Looked pretty good.  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Glad to be finished now.  Let's see the guys, what they are going to do in the afternoon, because it's supposed to pick up.  We'll see, 3-under, it's great.   
 Q.  Is that some of the toughest conditions you've seen at this event?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Definitely, yes.  For sure.  It's a stronger wind and it's gusting.  That's even more difficult than the regular wind.  So yeah, experience helped me in that time.
