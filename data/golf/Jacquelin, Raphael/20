Q.   Before going out, would you have taken that score?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yes, of course, big time.   I think 3‑under here on Le Golf National, I'll take it, very happy with it.   Even I saved a lot of pars, but I think the setup of the course is like that, so really, really happy.

Q.   How much has the course changed?   It's demanding off the tee.   Do you feel that? 
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, it's probably pretty much the same as usual from the tee, which I think it's easier for me because even when you hit the ball in the rough, you're going to lay up anyway and you're not going to try to hit the greens. 
So there's not too much trouble after that.   You're going to try to save par and make bogey instead of going like triple or double, like I used to do here sometimes. 

Q.   What will it mean for you to get your name on The French Open trophy?
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I mean, all of the French players want to put their name on this trophy.   It's been a long way to go, so three rounds to go, I'm just going to try to stay focussed on my game as I did today.   If the putter is hot like today, I might be up there.
