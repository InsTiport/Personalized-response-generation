 Q. How were the conditions? 
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Unbelievable. I tried to do my best. Yesterday I was 5-over, and the ball, just a little bit of movement sometimes. 

 Q. Should the Tour have stepped in? 
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: No. The ball didn't move really. The greens, just bumpy and difficult. 

 Q. Do you feel like you were on the wrong side of the draw? 
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I don't know. I think it was difficult for everybody anywhere I think. The weather at Carnoustie, probably the same. 
 Just some shots were unplayable, like No. 5 and No. 6, I hit the fairway and couldn't hit the green. The ball moved like 30 yards left or right with the wind. 
 So just to hit it close and chip, but didn't do it. Couldn't work with it. 
 I don't know the weather for tomorrow, but I think it's a little bit better. But today I think it's a bit too much. Five shots, it's not far away and many guys on four and many guys on five, but we'll try our best.
