  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Very solid, drove everything well, iron play was great and putted very well.  
   
 Q.   Which sounds an awful lot better than just solid.   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, it was.   Any time you make the US:   
  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   To shoot a low score like today, it's going to give me a good chance for tomorrow.   Very pleased with the 7‑under and I think we have another lovely day in Scotland and that's great.  
   
 Q.   The weather is set fair but there could be a little more wind tomorrow.   What factors do you think that might introduce into things?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I like the wind, so that's okay.   It's okay for me.   But I don't think it's expecting that much wind, maybe 20 kilometers probably.   The course is great.   It's quite open off the tee, so still going to have some chance for birdie.   
So going to have to shoot low, anyway, try to keep the same game and keep the same strategy for tomorrow and try again.   
   
 Q.   You've challenged closely in this championship before, most notably at Loch Lomond.   I wonder what sort of incentive it is for any professional golfer to try to win a big championship like this in the Home of Golf, Scotland.   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Especially when you play on a links course, I know Loch Lomond was not a links course but it was a great tournament and I finished second once and third another time I think.   
I feel like I like these big tournaments, and I never win a big tournament, so I'm looking for it.   So I guess shooting low today gave me a good chance for tomorrow, so looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   What sort of number do you think you may be behind the leaders by the end of the day?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Difficult to say, because the weather is so calm at the moment, there's going to be a lot of birdies at the end.   But if I'm about, I don't know, four shots off the lead would be good, so 17‑under, I would be happy with that.
