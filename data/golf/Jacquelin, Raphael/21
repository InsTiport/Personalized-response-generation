 Q.   After your opening 76 yesterday, you must have gone out wondering what you needed but you pretty well got what you needed.   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yeah, very happy with the 6‑under par today.   Conditions were a lot easier today but still, good feel with my game, especially after the wind, was not too bad.   Have been practising a lot to find a rhythm and find a feeling and confidence a little bit back.   So, I'm back.  
   
 Q.   What was the difference today?   Was it your playing or was the course setup just slightly easier in these good conditions?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   A little bit of everything.   Setup was easier.   Playing a little bit softer, as well, on the greens.   Still firm but easier to stop the ball with short shots, as well, compared to yesterday.   
Yesterday was really, really difficult, and I finished badly with a double‑bogey on 18.   So the rest was pretty steady and solid yesterday.   
So just keep trying and keep the confidence, because, yeah, I'm back, as I said, I'm feeling all right, so let's go and try to shoot low for the rest of the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel it helped you a little bit with some water on the greens last night?   Did it feel that way?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Yes, definitely, it was a little bit softer, but as I said, with the conditions, there's no wind today, just a little breeze, nothing much.   So you can go for the greens.   
   
 Q.   So, you're back.   But where have you been?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Not too far.  
   
 Q.   And where do you go from here?   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Next week to Sweden and then the U.S. Open.   So practising hard to be ready for these big, big majors.
