 Q.  Please tell me your thoughts on how you played across this week?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Played great and I'm very happy with my game of course, and as I said yesterday, the way I played the last three months was not very good and not very fun.  So I'm very pleased with the second place, even if I was hoping winning the trophy.  But it was a tough day today at the office, a lot of wind and it's always difficult to play in the last group and try to win. I tried my best and did pretty good at the end.  I tried to hole that last shot.  It was almost in.  I gave everything, which I just wanted to try to give everything today and that's what I did.   Q.  And does that mean that you were aware that you had to hole that shot?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: No, I was not aware of that.  But Rickie finishing on 12, I was sure of 11 and try to make birdie to make the playoff.  And then when I was walking, I saw 12-under par and I was a bit disappointed at that stage.  But again, I tried.  I tried hard, and it's great to finish second anyway.   Q.  I know you've touched on this across the week, but it's nice after the indifferent spell to move on through France and then suddenly have a victory chance, isn't it?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yeah, as I said, the way I played, I finished 24th last week in The French Open, the start of a real comeback, and this week it's a real comeback.  I think a chance to win a big tournament like that, it's always a great feeling, and I enjoyed it all the way. I'm so happy to play next week, of course, in St. Andrews.  I haven't been playing The Open since a few years, maybe three or four years maybe.  So it's a good week to come, and the confidence is back, as well, with my game.  So it's even better to play the British Open in a good form.   Q.  And all the better to play it at St. Andrews?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I've never played at St. Andrews, so couldn't be more special, that's for sure.   Q.  Will your knowledge of St. Andrews help given that you play just about every autumn?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Yes, I'm sure, we've been playing the Dunhill for me since '97, so I know pretty well the course.  It's great for the European players.   Q.  What is your best Open memory?  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Finished Top-10 in Royal St. George's I think.  I can't remember what year was it but I finished eighth.   Q.  You obviously love this style of golf.  RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: I love the links course.  I like that.  Like we did today, we had to create on every shot when the wind is strong and I think the wind is going to be strong next week.  So let's create some shots and we'll see at the end.
