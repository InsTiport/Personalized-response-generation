   RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: Of course, well, what else can I do, I holed a fantastic putt on 18 to be 8-under par but I just saw Darren made birdie on 17, so I think I'm going to be short for The Open next week. But I'm very pleased with the way I hit the ball all week and the last three weeks, so nothing better than that.

 Q. Were you looking at scoreboards out there this afternoon?
 RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN: At the end a little bit, I have to say yes, because of course I want to play The Open. But that's golf, and I played well, that's all I can do and very pleased.
