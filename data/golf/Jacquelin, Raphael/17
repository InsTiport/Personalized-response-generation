 Q.   Two rounds of 71, how did your play compare day‑to‑day?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Completely different.   I played really good yesterday and tee‑to‑green was really solid.   I think I hit like 16 greens yesterday.   And today was very difficult because the conditions, of course, and a bit cold, so I didn't hit the ball too solid today.  
I managed to save some good pars and had some chances for birdies, as well.   Under par, anyway, it's always good.   Pretty happy with 2‑under, not too far off the lead at the moment, so stay in contention, that was the idea.  
   
 Q.   Give us a sense of playing conditions today.   
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   There are some long holes.   It's playing into the wind and the rain.   You have to be lucky because if you don't play the long holes in the rain and too much wind, that's okay.   
But playing the first and the third into the wind and into the rain, that was very tough.   But that's the way it is, playing like a major.   I like it.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on two rounds of 71 around here?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   Very happy with 1‑under every day, for the first two days at Wentworth.   Especially today it was a lot more difficult than it was yesterday and especially because I didn't hit the ball that well today compared to yesterday.   I hit like 12 fairways and 16 greens yesterday.   
So feels a lot easier yesterday.   But, I mean, that's the way it is, it's cold, raining and a lot of wind, gusting, as well.   So it's tough.   So glad I finished and finished 2‑under par.   I'll take it.   I'll take it.   
   
 Q.   That is a nice position on the leaderboard, isn't it, because nobody is shooting low?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I mean, maybe one guy is going to shoot low, maybe no.   But for the rest, it's going to be‑‑ everybody is going to struggle to save pars.   
The idea was to stay in contention, not too far off the lead, so good job for the first two days, and then try to do the same for the rest of the week.   
   
 Q.   You've played alongside Kiradech Aphibarnrat suffering in this weather, but hard enough for you as well?  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   I felt really sorry for him, because I think it's 38 degrees at home for him.   He said, there's no way I can play in these conditions, but he did pretty well.   Yesterday, he paid a mistake at the end, but no, he's playing really well and hits the ball a long way.   
   
 Q.   Some players have lost a feel.  
RAPHAÃL JACQUELIN:   That's part of it, sometimes when you play, the Dunhill Links, the British Open, you know you're not going to hit the ball that solid compared to a sunny day.   So you have to take try to save par and that's what I did well today.
