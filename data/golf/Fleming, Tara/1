 Q.  What are you feeling heading into the semifinals?  
TARA FLEMING: I don't even know what to say.  I'm really overwhelmed.  I'm pleased that my game really was starting to come together at the end of this month, and I mean, since my -- since January 25th I've been thinking about playing in this tournament, and I'm just so thankful that I've been able to kind of keep it together and play some good golf.   
 Q.  What makes this so emotional for you?  
TARA FLEMING: I don't know.  I just think it's nice to be able to come out under this kind of pressure and be able to hang in there, and I really -- you get dealt a lucky match in the first round, and it really rattled me, and I had to figure out a way to get myself set, and so I really stopped playing match play, I'm playing stroke play out here, and every time I make a bogey I'm just trying to get myself back to even par, and I really don't care what the board says.  It's been very helpful because it's not uncommon for me to play a stroke play round of golf and be 2-over par in four holes and then come back and play even par.  I've been able to take that off of me, and to be 2-down in matches early on, some people would be like, oh, my God, I've got to dig back, and I'm like, no, I know I've got birdies in there.  I know they're going to come.  It's been a little bit easier to deal with the last three matches thinking in that mindset.
