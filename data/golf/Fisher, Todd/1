   TODD FISCHER: Yeah, you know, I just I don't know. It landed on the last hole and bounced over. Tough up-and-down, but for the most part, you know, it is a good start.   
 I did have some good breaks today and a couple poor ones, but they all equal out, I think. That's probably what I was gonna shoot if I didn't have a good or a bad break. So you know what, it's a good start, and I'm just happy to be here.  
  
  Q. You got off to a hot start like you said on the front nine. Obviously the eagle on 5. Can you just kind of talk me through that hole.   
 TODD FISCHER: Yeah, I hit two people off the tee, and just tried to land the ball short of the green and run it up and did exactly that. I actually pulled it a little bit and just caught a good bounce back on the green and it trickled all the way back there and went in.  
  
  Q. What club did you hit in there?  
 TODD FISCHER: I hit a 52.  
  
  Q. And lastly, first PGA Tour start of the year for you. Talk about your expectations for the next couple days.  
 TODD FISCHER: Anybody that's watched me the last few years knows I've been really struggling. I was pretty nervous. Normally I'm not. This is my pretty much one shot, and I'm thankful for everybody that supports me here in town and gave me a start.   
 So you know, I got comfortable, especially after the birdie to start. There are a few holes out here that eat me up. I got through them today, and so that made it easier. I thought I could tear up the back, but didn't.
