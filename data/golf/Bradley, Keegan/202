   KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was not fun. Just a bad day. 

 Q. I mean, after 16 and then you make a birdie, are you still feeling pretty confident that maybe you would get going at the end of the round?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I felt good. I just got a little bit of a jumper on my second shot, hit it in the bunker, and that's not a good spot to be.

 Q. What about in terms of the pin placements today versus yesterday? Much harder course to play today?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: No, I just didn't play that well. Just a tough day. 

 Q. Could any of it be just sort of taking an emotional turn on you? All the things you had to go through, being at home?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: No, I think I was fine, just sometimes you have bad days. I felt fine today. I was the most rested today I've been in the last couple weeks, so I felt good.

 Q. Having said that, are you looking forward to a week off, though?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah. I wish I was playing tomorrow, this weekend. Yeah, a week off is going to be good for me.

 Q. You had to feel pretty good about this just walking out here and all the people yelling?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it was real nice. A lot of fun to play these last couple days. It meant a lot to me.
