  Q. I thought it was a day of patience out there, especially after bogeying the first two holes, you were able to keep it in tact and get into the house with 3-under for the tournament.   
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it's playin' tough out there right now, especially 18.   
 We were talking in the trailer, I don't know how you pull the fairway on 18; it's playing tough.   
  
  Q. I guess you have to start out over the lake on 18, not a lot of people brave enough to do that.   
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, and you've got to start way over the lake.   
 It's one of the toughest holes I've ever played honestly, right now.   
  
  Q. Tell us about the golf course.   
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: The course is playing great, the guys did such a good job of getting the course ready after the hail damage. I'm impressed with the course, I think it's awesome.   
  
  Q. You have to be satisfied with your round playing in these conditions.   
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I'm really satisfied. Like I said, I was 2-over after 2, and I made a 6-footer for par on 6. I battled back and it was a good day.  
  
  Q. See you on the weekend.   
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Okay.
