Q.   Just talk about the conditions you face out here in the first round?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think the TOUR did a great job setting the course up really fair.   A lot of tees up and pins were in general spots.   I think that's the only way we were able to play today.

Q.   And your round as a whole? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Really good.   I had three 3â€‘putts, at least a couple that could have been really good, but anything under par today is a really good score.

Q.   Any wind issues as far as balls blowing off tees? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I didn't have any issues today.   The greens are much slower than they were, so you know, if the greens were any faster, we wouldn't be able to play.
