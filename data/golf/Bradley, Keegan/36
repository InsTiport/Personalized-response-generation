Q. Can you just talk about what it was like out there?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I just didn't get off to a good start.  It's just playing so tough on that back side.  Just you can't be 2-over after five or whatever I was.
Q. You've got to get on the front, right?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah.
Q. I know you had two days, what else was different about today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Not much.  I got two really bad breaks and that hurt.  But, oh, it's such a bummer.  But I'll come out tomorrow and shoot a good one.
Q. What breaks?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I hit a decent shot on the 14th hole, the par-3 and it kicked into like this really deep fescue rough.  Then on 4 I hit it or par-5, I think it might be 4, I hit it and it was in like a rake rivet and it was just right up against the lip.  Then I got a really bad lie on 14 or 15.
Q. What are you playing for tomorrow?  You were in contention and now they've got some separation.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, they're playing great.  3-under today right now is a really good score.  Happy I can go out tomorrow and play for a top finish.  Looking forward to going out there again and shooting a good score.
Q. Top 10, top 5?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, yeah, you go out there -- I don't know what the weather's going to be like, but you shoot a couple under and you'll jump up.
Q. Finally are you just surprised the way you played the first two days that you had a day like that?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I didn't play all that bad today.  I got off to a bad start.  I hit some good shots on the front that didn't work out.  It kind of happens over here.  But I just hit some putts that didn't go in.  It just was one of those days that doesn't work.
Q. You've been looking to get in contention and there you were.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, yeah, that feels good.
Q. Though it makes it a little harder?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it does.
