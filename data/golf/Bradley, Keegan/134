 Q.   Keegan, just a little bit short.   Comments on today, and also the week as a whole.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was a good battle today.   Graeme just played so great.   You know, he just had one 3‑putt.   Other than that, he just played awesome.   
   
 Q.   The chip on 16 looked like from the TV replay you were looking at it and thinking it might go in and then it kind of grazed off the side there?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   There was a little mud on my ball.   I thought it was dead center.   And it just kind of stopped breaking.   That was a big chip, obviously.  
But I am very proud of the way I played today, and I'll take this with me for a while?  
   
 Q.   Crowds today, any incidents?   Everything all right?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, no, no.   People were great.   I don't want to make yesterday into too big of a deal.   The people here in Sherwood were awesome.  
   
 Q.   I know the USGA issued a statement.   Did you get wind of that?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I did.   That was very nice.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about Graeme's performance out there.   It was pretty dialed in all week.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, Graeme really likes this place.   He played solid all day.   You know, just when I thought maybe I'd have a good chance, he'd hole a putt or hit a chip like he did on 17.   
You know, he's a champion, so you know, I don't expect anything less out of him.   
   
 Q.   What is it you think you like about playing golf here in California so much?   You seem to really do well here.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   That's true.   I never thought of that.   You know, I really enjoy this area.   But it's very similar to the grass and stuff that I grew up on.   Maybe that's it.   I can't quite put my finger on it, but I really like these courses they have out here.  
   
 Q.   What do you take out of this year looking back on it compared to last year?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I just kind of see myself more as one of the guys now.   Somebody that can contend a majority of the time that they tee it up.   And today was a good test for me, playing with Graeme.   I really hung in there tough.   
   
 Q.   I was just going to ask about (indiscernible) today.   Obviously got the toughest time.   How much does that add into trying to catch somebody in terms of getting aggressive?   Graeme was having the spin coming off greens.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   It is difficult.   But you know, Graeme ‑‑ the thing about Graeme is he didn't make a mistake all day.   You know, you're just kind of hoping for somebody to make one bad swing or something like that.   He didn't.   He played just absolutely phenomenal.
