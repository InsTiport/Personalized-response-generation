 Q.   Obviously a tough day.   When did it kind of get away from you?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I actually played pretty well, just made one bad swing on 6 and had a bunch of lip‑outs.   
   
 Q.   The way Noh was playing, was it going to be tough to be anything less than perfect today?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, he played really well.   He should be very proud of the way he played.   He's a great player.   This is a great tournament to win.   He should be very proud.   
   
 Q.   The one on 6, just kind of‑‑ it's hard to overcome something like that, isn't it?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I took it pretty well.   I played really well after that, just a couple three‑putts and a couple really bad lip‑outs, but I take a lot away from being in contention.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the wind today.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was a different golf course.   The course played a lot harder.   This is how it always is around here, it's just the first three days we kind of got lucky with no wind.
