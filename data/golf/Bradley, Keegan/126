Q.   The conditions out there, obviously interesting day for a guy from the north, for you, I would imagine?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it wasn't that when we first got here this morning and then it just quickly got really bad.   I think the tour mid the right decision.

Q.   But the snow, practicing in the cold, all of a sudden you might be one of the favorites?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I've played in this a million times, but not for a long time.

Q.   In snow like this?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I've played in worse.   This is a little worse because it was a wet snow.   I've played in it and it's actually not that bad.   This was pretty bad. 

Q.   How many holes did you get in?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm on the 4th green.

Q.   So not a whole lot?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.

Q.   But overall, just you are excited to get back out here tomorrow?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I think that this is the right decision because it was getting a little silly out there.   So now we'll go out tomorrow.   Supposed to be good weather tomorrow.   Still be a little chilly, but it'll be fun.
