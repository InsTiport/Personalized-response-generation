 Q.   Just a bogey on No.2 today but a clean round overall, just comment if you can?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I played really well again.   Really poor bogey on 2 and then I played solid the rest of the way.   I could have been a little better but I left a bunch of putts short coming in, which is unlike me.   
But I feel really good.   I really love this golf course.   You know, I'm looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   And going into the weekend, you've got Tiger, you've got Phil and you've got all of those guys and you're just four or five back, maybe a good spot, fly under the radar?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Any time Tiger or Phil is in the lead, I'm going to fly under the radar anyways.   I'd like to be a little closer but this course you can make up ground and maybe some wind comes in and makes this course a little tougher.   But I'm in a good position.   I'd like to be a couple better but it is what it is.  
   
 Q.   Take me through the eagle.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I hit a perfect driver down the middle.   I had 204 to the flag downwind, and hit a little cut 7â€‘iron in there to about 12 feet, best shot of the day and made the putt.
