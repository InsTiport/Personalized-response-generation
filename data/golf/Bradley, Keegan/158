 Q.   Solid 3‑under today.   Talk about the course, talk about how it was playing out there.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, course was great.   I had a great group.   We both played pretty well.   It was a lot of fun.   I love this golf course.   Everything about it is awesome.  
   
 Q.   Everybody has basically talked about the greens, says they're absolutely pure.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, they're as good a greens as I've ever played in my life.   This is very comparable to Augusta, speeds and trueness.   They're so good.   I can't remember a time I've played better greens.   
   
 Q.   Can it make it a putting contest?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I putted very well today, and Jason did.   If you hit good putts, they're going to go in, which is so great.   It gives you so much confidence going from hole to hole.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about 9.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I hit it into some of the thickest rough out on the whole course.   But I made like a little sneaky four‑footer on the last hole that would have just been terrorizing if I missed it.   I actually feel really good because you make double on the last hole, you're pretty upset.   So that felt really good.   
   
 Q.   With greens this pure, does it change your tee to green strategy at all?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   To be honest with you, it does a little bit, because all you've got to do is get it on the green in relative distance.   Although these greens it's like Augusta where some spots on the green you're better off the green in a different spot.   So you've got to hit it in the right spot.   But anywhere on the green, it's got a good chance to go in.
