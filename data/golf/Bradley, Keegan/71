 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Definitely was kind of challenging out there.   The wind was‑‑ I don't know if I've ever played where the wind was all over the place like it was today.   So I'm really happy with the way I played.  
   
 Q.   One of your playing competitors, Tom Watson, was watching yours and Webb Simpson's game intently.   Could you feel that?   Did you recognize that at all?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, yeah.   You can definitely‑‑ he's got a presence, for sure.   It's definitely a challenge, but it's an honor just to be out there playing.   So I think it's very rare.   Not a lot of sports you can play with a legend like Tom.   So memorable day for sure.  
   
 Q.   Considering you and Webb veterans at the Ryder Cup and right now outside the top nine.   What was the dialogue like, and did you feel like today was sort of a tryout?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's hard not to think it wasn't, but you'd think that one round or two rounds wouldn't determine us being on the team.   I mean that would be kind of silly.  
But it doesn't hurt to play well.   Put it that way.  
   
 Q.   Keegan, the weather diametrically different morning than afternoon.   Obviously most of the good stuff happened in the morning in terms of scores.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   It definitely was blowing this afternoon.   But that just shows, you know, 67 for me is a good round.   Hopefully tomorrow we can go out there with no wind.
