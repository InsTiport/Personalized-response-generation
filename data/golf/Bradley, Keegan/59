 Q.  Does that feel more than a point?  Huge psychological blow as well.  PHIL MICKELSON: Well, we didn't have our best stuff there.  You saw it on the back nine, it was tough conditions, but we gave a few holes away, and we were able to keep the match close.  The eagle that Keegan made on 16 was just huge because it gave us a huge momentum boost coming down the stretch. Even though we fought it for a few holes, we were able to hang in there until it turned and those shots that Keegan hit on 16 were just stupendous.   Q.  The turning point obviously was that eagle.  How big is the adrenaline rush when you hit that second shot and know you've set it up?  KEEGAN BRADLEY: You know, it's unexplainable.  You can't explain it.  It's like you're drinking 500 cups of coffee at once.  It's just a blast.  I'm having the time of my life again.
