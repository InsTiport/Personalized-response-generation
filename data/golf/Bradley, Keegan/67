Q.   You obviously play really well at Firestone, just a strong finish again. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I didn't play that great today, but I hung in there. 
I do play well here.   I love Firestone.   I love everything about this place, the atmosphere, the course, the grass.   Everything's amazing.

Q.   Kind of faltered at the end a little bit there.   What happened on the back nine? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't know.   I was playing so well.   Something just got a little off, flew the green on this one par 3.   I hit a really good shot, and then I missed a couple shots by 2 feet, and I was behind trees.   Just kind of how it goes.
