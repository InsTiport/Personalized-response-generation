  THE MODERATOR: Keegan Bradley, here at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.  This is your fourth start here at TPC Scottsdale.  You have a couple of top 25s in the past.  Can you tell us a little bit what it's like being here at TPC and we will open it up for questions.KEEGAN BRADLEY: The course looks great.  They did an unbelievable job redoing the course.  A lot harder but still very fair.  I think this is a great test to golf now, for sure.Q. Which win would you rather have on Sunday?KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's a lot harder than you would imagine, but I'd like to win this tournament, but just to be here and be able to go watch the Patriots play in the Super Bowl is a dream come true.  I never thought I'd be able to get to go to a Super Bowl, let alone watch the Patriots play and hopefully they will win.Q. Have you participated in any Super Bowl related stuff or seen any players or anything like that?KEEGAN BRADLEY: No.  I try to leave the guys alone, because I know how I am when I'm getting ready to play a tournament.  I have had a few text messages here and there with some of the boys, but I want them to do their thing, get rested.  I'm not looking for any favors, any special seats or anything.  I just want to be at the game and watch them win.Q. We asked Rickie earlier with all this fresh, new talent coming on if he feels he's still one of the young guns.  Do you feel like one of the young guns?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Not really.  Starting my fifth year on tour.  I feel like -- I always ask a lot of people, At what point do you become a veteran out here?  I don't think I'm a veteran by any means, but I'm definitely closer to that than I am a rookie now, which is really cool to feel comfortable out here. And this is my fifth year on tour.  I can't believe it.  It doesn't seem like very long ago I was freaking out and just getting started.Q. So how do you feel like you're playing right now?KEEGAN BRADLEY: I feel great.  Srixon dialed me into a new driver this week that I feel is going to make a huge difference.  I'm really, really excited to get out there, because this is a very rare course where you hit a driver almost every hole.  It's very rare now when you go to a course where you get to pound drivers.  It's a lot of hybrids and 3-woods, and this is an exciting test.  People who drive the ball well here are going to succeed.Q. Did you hit your driver on 1?KEEGAN BRADLEY: I hit driver on 1 today.  That might be a 3-wood.  I mean, who knows?  We have weather coming, rain.  It might be a driver.  You can hit a driver on 1.  It's narrow, but you could.Q. Are you working on anything in particular on your game right now?KEEGAN BRADLEY: No.  I mean, I'm past working on stuff.  I'm more on a maintenance level right now, working a lot with my putting and short game, stuff like that.Q. The people you talk to, what did they say is the dividing line between the younger generation and the veteran?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Well, from everyone I talked to, they say Ryder Cups factor in, wins factor in, how many years you have been on tour.  I don't know. I'm 28.  I think you've got to be under 25 to be a true young gun, but I'm definitely not -- I left Phil -- when he comes in here next, ask him.  When I outdrove him today by 30 yards, I left him a note in the fairway, letting him know the senior tees are not that far off, don't get too worked up about it.  (Laughter.) I feel as though I'm settling in out here and feel more comfortable every year I play.Q. Where do you stand on the belly?  I know you did some tinkering last year; is that right?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I have been using the conventional putter since after the Ryder Cup.Q. Every time?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Every time.  I haven't touched my belly.  My belly putter, yeah (smiling).  I haven't touched it.  I still travel with it, but I haven't used it or even thought about going back to it.Q. Why travel with it?KEEGAN BRADLEY: I don't know.  I heard that Webb snapped his putter.  I think that's actually smart.  I don't know why I travel with it, because I have no plans to use it. I just -- I don't know.  I feel like it's a lot of superstition.  I can't explain it.  You don't have a clue how many superstitions I've got.Q. How do you consider the results post-Ryder Cup with it?  How have you felt it's coming along?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Good.  I have only played -- I have played three events.  I played China, didn't do very well.  I actually putted pretty well.  Then Tiger's tournament, putted really well, probably the best I putted for a tournament in a long time, as a whole. And at Humana, I putted just okay.  I didn't putt bad, didn't putt great.  Just middle ground.  But, you know, I'm realizing the fact that I'm going to have bad weeks and bad days putting just like I would with the belly putter.Q. Did you find a difference between long or short on the putts, 50-footers compared with...KEEGAN BRADLEY: Well, I feel like there is pluses and minuses with both.  I have so much more touch with my short putter.  I feel like I have -- best way to explain it, I feel like I have more of the hole to use.  With the belly putter I felt like every putt I hit I had to hammer in the back. I couldn't finesse any putts in.  I feel like I have more of the hole to work with. With the belly, I didn't have to worry about my setup as much as I do now.  Now I'm constantly having to be aware of my ball position, where I'm holding the club, my posture.  Those are things I didn't have to worry as much about.  There are pluses and minuses to both.Q. Do the superstitions only apply to your own game or Patriots football, also?KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah.  They do.  Everything.Q. What's a superstition for how they...KEEGAN BRADLEY: I normally like to watch them, when I'm home -- I have watched every game this year, so I like to sit in the same spot.  I have -- this is really embarrassing, but I have a set of wide receiver Patriot gloves I put on now and then. I had them on the last time they were losing against the Ravens.  I took them off and I left them at home.  I didn't bring them.  I get a lot of weird stuff I do, as you all are very aware of.
