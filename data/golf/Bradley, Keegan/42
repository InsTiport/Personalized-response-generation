KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I just didn't play very well, compared to the last two.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Obviously I'm not thinking about that too much.  I want to try to win tournaments, so that's secondary.  But I want to go shoot a good round, whether I make it or not.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I had some really, really bad breaks there.  But a couple worst of the year.  Didn't play all that bad.  I played nicely on the front and just shot even par, should have been 3- or 4-under.  And then the backside, there was a three hole stretch where I couldn't believe it was happening.  I plugged it in the bunker on 11.  I had to take an unplayable, I couldn't find it for a while.  And so I kind of hit it in the trees and it went up against this tree branch.  I couldn't advance it.  I tried and I couldn't.  It was bizarre.  So those were some bad breaks, but I'm hoping to play well tomorrow.
