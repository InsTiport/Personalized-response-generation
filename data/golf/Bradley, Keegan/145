Q.   The four key putts you made for birdie -- but were you surprised at the two holes that The European Team gave you on 12 and 14? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   You know, I think that the greens are tough out here anyways.   I feel so comfortable out here with Phil because I know wherever I hit it, he's going to be able to get it up‑and‑down or close for me.   It was one of the most memorable days of my life so far.
