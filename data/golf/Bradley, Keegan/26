Q. You threatened the course record on Friday; you threatened it again today.  What a finish, three in a row after the delay.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, that was pretty incredible because the winds are different, so the birdie on 17 was probably the best of the day.  And never know, I'm going to wait around.  Probably a few short, but I'm going to wait for sure.
Q. You never know.  That wind has flipped in the valley, and you don't know, the number might be better than you think.  Speaking of wind flipping, I overheard you say something to your caddie on the second shot on 18.  Was there a change in the direction or did you think you got a gust there?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It switched around.  I didn't get the shot I wanted to.  I had a really bad number there.  It was just right in between two clubs.  It just wasn't a great number.  Sometimes that happens, but I gave the chip a good run.
Q. I saw you call an official on 15.  You got a drop.  I saw you talking about it on 18.  What was the story there with the lie on 18 with the eagle chip?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: There was a little red dot next to my ball, and I think it was just a measure of the back edge of the green, but I wanted to double-check in case it was a sprinkler, I probably could have dropped it on the green.  So I checked knowing probably 80% chance I wouldn't be able to, but turned out it was just a mark for the back of the green.
Q. You never know unless you ask.  Great up-and-down, great finish.  We don't know where it's going to stand, but regardless, it was a great week and good luck the rest of the way.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Thank you very much.
Q. It was a nice finish, I guess.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I think it would probably be a couple short, one Orr two short, but I'm going to wait around and see.  Those holes in the valley can play tough if the wind is up, so you never know.  But these last two par-5s are going to be mid-irons for DJ.  So you've got to figure he's going to birdie a couple of them, so we'll see.
Q. (Indiscernible) these four rounds?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's probably my most tidy short game putting tournament since I switched away from the belly putter.  So really big step forward for me, and it's so fun to be able to play with a chance to win.  It's just something that I love, and it was fun this week.
Q. You had Scott Dale on the bag.  I know he's a local guy around here.  How much help has he been?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: He's been great.  Scotty has been telling me where to go in Toronto.  He knows a lot of the area.  He's a great caddie, and he's helped me a lot this week.
Q. What was the big difference between yesterday's round and today's round?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I don't know.  Yesterday's round was a weird round.  I didn't play all that bad, but I didn't score very well.  I didn't play the front side great.  If you can get around the front side a couple under, you're in really good shape with the back with the par-5.  So I hung in there, made a couple birdies coming in, which got me a chance to shoot low and made me hang in there today.
Q. You're projected to be 31st on the FedExCup standings.  Are your eyes on East Lake at this point?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, that's the goal for me the last couple years, getting to East Lake and kind of secure my chance at playing in all four majors.  That's a big goal of mine.  But the playoffs determine so much of that, so I'll have to wait.
Q. What point did you realize you were in contention?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: When I birdied 16 coming back out of the rain delay, and then figured if I could go birdie-eagle, I'd have a shot.  17 is playing really, really difficult or was when I came out.  When I made birdie there, I was just it was game on.  It really was.  Hit a driver down and hit a wedge in.
But, unfortunately, I had a really uncomfortable number, and it was just in between two clubs.  I didn't hit the best shot, but hit a great chip.
Q. So you hit the chip on the green, what's going through your mind?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I thought it had a really good chance for a long time.  I really did.  I had a horrible lie, and it was really easy to just kind of leave it right in front of you.  Wanted to make sure I gave it a run.  It might have been one of my best shots of the week, really, truly it was a tough, tough lie.
