Q.   Talk about the difference, obviously early on, you seemed like you were rolling and after the rain delay, it seemed like you struggled to make some good putts that you were looking at. 
PHIL MICKELSON:   Yeah, we were got off to a good start.   We were rolling there through seven holes.   We were 5‑under and playing well, and when they birdied 8 and 9 to get it back to even‑‑ after the rain, I ended up having a bad practice session before I went out, and I played terribly the back nine and left Keegan alone on a lot of holes, and that's tough to do when you've got to make birdies, and he made a number of birdies, a number of putts to keep us in it and then we just lost it there in the end. 

Q.   The distances you had, unusual to see you as short as you were, and in hazards, can you talk about the clubs and what you think the issue was there? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   12, like I say, I just hit two terrible shots, 8‑irons, just very poorly struck.   I had a good rhythm early on and when we went back out, I was just a little bit tight and didn't make very good swings. 

Q.   Keegan, you seemed like you were short on some putts and then you were long on some putts.   Did you ever get a real handle on the greens after the rain delay? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't think it had anything to do with the rain delay.   I just didn't role it my best today, but I hit the ball pretty good, so that's a good sign.   I can't putt like that for very much longer; it will turn.
