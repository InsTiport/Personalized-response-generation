 Q.   Inaudible.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I played about as good as I could play.   I didn't miss a fairway or a green.   I saw a lot of birdies and that's always tough to beat.  
   
 Q.   When you get 3‑up after 10, as you were, are you trying to get it done as fast as you can?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I wanted to get it done ‑‑ every match done as fast as I can.   Then you know Geoff is going to make some birdies and you just want to keep the pedal to the metal.   
   
 Q.   Obviously last week you played beautifully and got into the playoff.   You had some criticism for the spitting and the slow play.   Give us your thoughts on that.   I know you are going to put it behind you.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I got some advice from some people close to me, and I'm happy to report I didn't spit one time today.   And my preshot routine was really good.   I think that's one of the reasons why I played well.   I'm really proud of the no spitting, and I'm going to keep trying not to.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to put last week behind you?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I feel extra good beating Geoff Ogilvy because he's such a good player at this event and a good player in general, but especially here.   It just feels really good.  
   
 Q.   I know his long‑term goal is Ryder Cup.   Are you ‑‑ you haven't played match play in a long time.   Were you putting extra emphasis on this to try and really make a point and say something?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I mean, I think every week that you play you are try to prove yourself to get on that team.   This week obviously might shine a little brighter because it's match play.   But you know, it's just another golf tournament.   If you play good golf, you are going to win matches.   
   
 Q.   Going back to last week carrying it into this week, what is going to best for you right now?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Just hitting the ball really, really well in terms of hitting it in the fairway and hitting it on the green and not hitting any bad shots.   I gave myself a bunch of chances today.
