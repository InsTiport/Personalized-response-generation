 Q.   What was going on out there today?   I know you had a good run there on the Back 9.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I never was comfortable, but I hung tough and finished, you know, shot 3‑under on the back or 2‑under which is big.   Kept me in the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You love coming out here, don't you?   One of the only two New England events on the TOUR.   This is kind of a must stop for you?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Absolutely.   The people of Travelers and the people of Hartford are the best, and I love coming back here.   It's a home event for me.  
   
 Q.   How much would it mean to you to win this one?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It would mean a lot.   I really hope some day I get to win this tournament.   I think I have my best shot so far right now.   I mean I'm six back, but go out tomorrow and leave it all out there.  
   
 Q.   Last couple of things for you.   What do you do before you tee off?   That's quite a process there.   Is that like a superstitious thing?   Where did that whole thing start?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's not a superstitious thing.   It's just something I do.   It's very weird, I know.   Just gets me ready.   
   
 Q.   And I see you're a big New England sports fan.   With all the logos on your wallet and on your bag, whatever, your scorebook there.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   I mean I'm a New Englander to the bone.   So all Boston sports are my passions basically.
