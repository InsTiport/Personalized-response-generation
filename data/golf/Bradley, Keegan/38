Q. How did the course play today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It played nicely.  I can't remember a time I played here in this kind of no conditions but the greens are perfect.  The course is set-up nice.
Q. What was the best part of your game today, what was keeping you in the ballgame?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I drove the ball really well and putted very well.  I made a bunch of five to 10-footers for par coming in which I hadn't been making and that's a big advantage when you can do that.
Q. Helpful that you were one of the first groups out?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was great.  I went out there today and it was no wind.  The greens were perfect.  You know, you can't ask for anything more playing a tough course like this.
Q. Jason Day got a pretty good jump on the field.  Do you think you guys could catch him?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Listen, Jason is an unbelievable player.  This is a tough course.  He goes out there and shoots a couple under each round he's going to be tough to catch.  You can shoot a number here pretty quick.
Q. Thanks.
