 Q. One of the rookie stars of the week, your second TOUR event, you're going to top-10?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it's a great feeling. It's probably the most fun round I've ever played in my life, so it's just a dream come true.

 Q. Talk to me about it. What did it feel like to play a final round Sunday on this TOUR? You played a lot of them on the Nationwide Tour. 
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Well, it was different, for sure. But I got a lot of experience last year in the Nationwide Tour and without that, I don't think I could have survived today. So thanks a lot to the Nationwide Tour. 

 Q. No bogeys on the back side. When all the heat was on, you kept the pressure on?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it was. I felt it coming down the end. But all in all, I had a really good attitude and I felt calm.

 Q. What do you take from this going forward? And are you going to San Diego?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: I'm going to San Diego, and I think this just is another sign that I can play with these guys out here. 
 I can't imagine having a better job at this time in my life. 

 Q. Best of luck in San Diego. 
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Thank you.
