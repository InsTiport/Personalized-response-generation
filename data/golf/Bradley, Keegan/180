 Q.   Just talk about your first time here at the match play.   It's Ryder Cup year, maybe what you learned about getting back into match play and this format?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I love it.   It was a lot of fun.   I wish I could have done better.   It just shows match play is so day‑to‑day.   
   
 Q.   Any key moments one way or another out there?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I hit a couple of putts to square the match which were big.   I just didn't putt that well today.   That's so huge in match play.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about getting back to the East Coast and what you are looking forward to about the next few events that you are playing.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I look forward to going home.   I'm going to be four weeks at my house, which is the most I've ever had, I think.   So that's going to be nice and relaxing.
