 Q.   (Inaudible.)   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Just a lot of golf out there, a bunch of plugged lies.   Had a lie around the green that I hit backwards.   Missed a couple of fairways by a foot.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I stayed up and then I fell asleep.   
   
 Q.   The low score today so far is 3‑under.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   The course is hard.   The course is soft, it almost makes it harder.   The rough is thicker.   The greens aren't rolling.   The course is hard.   You get it in the fairway and you can make bogey on a par.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   He played very well.   He missed the fairway and laid up.   Is putting awesome, made a couple of ridiculous up‑and‑downs, is playing well.   
   
 Q.   Did you guys have a chance to talk about his last 24 hours?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   He's had a crazy last 24 hours.   Sometimes that helps, not thinking about it.   He's going to get rest and he'll be in great shape.  
   
 Q.   What do you think it will be like tomorrow?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I've got to shoot as low as I can a couple of days.   I've got to have one really good round.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I just‑‑ I didn't play it that bad, I made triple on 16.   I made a mistake in trying to go for the green.   17 and 18 were really good shots.   You just get penalized if you miss the fairways.
