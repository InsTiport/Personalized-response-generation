 Q.   Just talk about today's round.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was a great round.   Could have been a little better, but any time you shoot under par here at PGA, the Honda, it's a good round so I'm happy with it.   
   
 Q.   What was the key with dealing with the wind and the weather today?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's really important to stay real calm when it's really windy like that and not get too excited, up or down.   I did a really good job of that today, but also I was really striking the ball well.   
   
 Q.   You missed the cut last year; did you learn something from last year?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I'm just a lot more comfortable out here.   This was one of my first events as a PGA TOUR pro, and I'm just feeling for comfortable and especially feeling a lot more comfortable in contention.   I enjoy it and look forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   There's a lot of increment weather and you're in threesomes; what's your approach?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Same as today, you have to be really, really calm and be patient with yourself and know that even par, anywhere around even par is a good score, so you can't get too upset up or down.   You have to stay real level.   
   
 Q.   The waiting on Sunday with threesomes, is that going to be tough to adjust?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I think we are used to that and especially when you are in contention, you are not even thinking about it.   It's kind of easier to deal with.   
   
 Q.   Any birdies stand out today for you?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Birdie on 15 was awesome.   I also birdied the 7th hole which was playing 234 yards, hit it to ten feet and made it, which was a bonus for sure.
