Q.   Happy with the finish after how this week started? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Good job by the TOUR and people at the Kapalua.

Q.   Your assessment on your three days?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I made really well.   I just didn't put my best.   Especially today.   If I putted okay, who knows where I would have been, but good week, good start to the year.

Q.   Do the greens get a little quicker today than yesterday?   I know they had to slow them down so you guys could play?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   They were pretty slow but they had to be.   It was a tough adjustment.   I left a bunch of putts short today.
