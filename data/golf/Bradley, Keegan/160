Q.   What's your first impression of Irish links golf? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I love it, yeah.   I wish I could have played a little better.   Just didn't play the par 5s really well, and a couple lost balls, and that's no good.

Q.   Is it not just the conditions, but the golf course and links play something that's a little bit alien to you? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I played pretty well other than about three shots; if I could have those back, I could be four or five shots better without a lost ball.   I'm disappointed but I've got a couple of weeks before the British Open.

Q.   You made a poor start today with the 7 on the par5 but then a great run of birdies. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, that was fun to do.   Wish I could have kept it going but maybe next time.

Q.   It obviously meant a lot to you to play in this Irish Open and hopefully you'll be coming back again. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I look forward to it.   I hope to come back another time, certainly as long as the schedule works out.   Everybody treated me so well.   I can't wait to come back. 

Q.   And the experience you've had in links golf, do you think it will stand to you when you go to the British Open later on? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I think I will know a little more what to expect there and any time you're here playing this course, it will help your game.
