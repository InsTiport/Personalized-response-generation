Q.   Bogey‑free round.   What do you think the key was to scoring?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I played‑‑ I actually played very well.   A few more putts and both of those rounds could have been really good.

Q.   Do you think the scoring was a little bit easier today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, yeah, Graeme played really well.   I mean, that's a good score on this course.   But you know, if you play well and make some putts, you can take advantage of those holes, especially the par‑5s.

Q.   Looking forward to the weekend?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, very excited, in a good spot, and it's going to be fun.
