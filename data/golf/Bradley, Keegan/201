 Q. What kind of scoreboard watcher are you? 
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: I'm going to try not to watch anything. There's a lot of stuff to watch, but I try not to watch it.

 Q. Have you done enough do you think if you don't win on Sunday, have you done enough to earn a spot on The Presidents Cup team?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: You know, put it this way, I really want to play. Whoever he picks is going to be a worthy pick. I don't want to say that I've done something to get on the team, because I haven't. But it would be an honor to be picked by him, and it would just be so much fun to go over there and play.
