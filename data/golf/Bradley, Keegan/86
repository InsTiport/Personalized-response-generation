Q.   What was working for you today, seemingly, from my vantage point, everything?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I played this exact same yesterday, just no putts.   Went to talk to Dr. Bob last night and my buddy, John, and just talked about getting less into making putts and more into just having fun and looking forward to making them. 

Q.   Yesterday from tee‑to‑green you were fabulous.   And you played like that today.   I guess the putter was the difference?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, the putter was the difference.   Finally made a few putts.   Felt so good. 
I feel like I've got some good mojo going into the weekend.

Q.   Where is the game right now?   I see a lot of improvement.   And confidence has to be building, right?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, playing so good.   Played so good all year, not much to show for it.   And if this putter clicks a little bit, I think I'll have a good chance this weekend.

Q.   I know you've been working out.   Are you getting more length off the tee?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I'm trying.   I'm just trying to get more in shape so I can be playing out here every week.
