 Q.   You didn't play as well today, but bogey‑free round.   What do you think the key was to scoring?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I actually played very well.   A few more putts, and both of those rounds could have been really good.  
   
 Q.   So you think the scoring was a little bit easier today, since Graeme went out there and shot 6‑under?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, yeah.   Graeme played really well.   That's a good score on this course.  
But you know, if you play well and make some putts, you can take advantage of these holes, especially the par‑5s.   
   
 Q.   Only a few shots back.   Looking forward to the weekend?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, yeah.   Very excited.   And in a good spot.   It's going to be a lot of fun.
