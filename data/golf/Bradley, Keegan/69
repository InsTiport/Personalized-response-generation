 Q.   Do you feel like you maximized everything out of your round today?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Sort of.   It was kind of a weird round.   I played well.   I just didn't make a lot of putts, but then I made a couple of really long ones.   
So definitely a strange round, but I'm sort of right in it, in the last couple groups tomorrow.   Similar position to last year, got to go low.  
   
 Q.   Given the fact a 61 was posted yesterday, does that give you optimism it can be done tomorrow?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Oh, it can be done out here.   If you hit the ball on the fairway, you can really score.   I think that's what's been the success out here for a lot of the champions is hitting a lot of fairways.   
You can attack these greens.   They're going to be soft and ready to smash tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Finally, Sergio's playing well.   When you're chasing with a bit of a gap between you and him, do you count on him not backing up or do you just have to go full blitz?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, you've got to go full blitz and kind of expect him to shoot, even par one under.   Shoots even better than that, we've got problems.   He's playing really well.   I've got to go out there and shoot a low 60s tomorrow to do it.   
Which I've done in the past year, so I've got that in my back pocket.   
   
 Q.   67, well played, but you've got to feel like you left some out there.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I did.   I played really solid.   Hopefully tomorrow, the putts are all going to go in.
