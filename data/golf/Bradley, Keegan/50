 Q.   Obviously got to be pretty happy with that round despite what happened on the first hole.   So kind take about that.   First hole jitters or what happened on that first one?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Not really jitters, just bad shot.   Really wet and downhill into the grain wedge shot.   I just chunked it.   But then played really well after that.   It's only bad shot I hit all day.  
   
 Q.   The conditions obviously wet for everybody but you got to put the ball in your hand quite a bit.   
Does that balance it out a little bit that you get to move the ball and clean it off versus how sloppy it is throughout?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   The tournament and the ground crews have done an unbelievable job getting it to where it is.   It was a lot wetter on Tuesday.   Having the ball in hand makes it playable.  
   
 Q.   What about the tournament that you won back in 2011 playing it here, still good memories, still good vibes when you get out here and want to play?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Definitely.   A lot of good stuff out here that's happened to me.   I played well here a bunch.   Shooting 4-under today was a little windy.   Those are good scores.  
   
 Q.   Were you thinking 66, 65?   Anything in your mind?   Did you have a number when you teed off?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I knew the greens were going to be wet so I knew you could make a lot of birdies but 66 I would have taken for sure to start the day.  
   
 Q.   You saw 62 posted so I guess you knew something was out there low, right?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I saw that early.   So I knew that -- I knew I had to go out and shoot a good number for sure.   You don't want to get too far behind Thursday.  
   
 Q.   Good feeling, going to hit some balls?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm done.   I'm going to get a little stretch and get ready for tomorrow's round.
