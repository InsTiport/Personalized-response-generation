 Q.  If you could talk about today.  65, pretty solid.  You have to be really happy with the way you played?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I really was hot on the front, made a bunch of putts.  It's just I love being out here at The Greenbrier.  I love the course.  It really requires a lot of shot shaping.  I just love it out here.   
 Q.  The eagle at 12, you hit a long one there, that had to feel pretty good.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it did.  That was one of my longest putts of the year.  It had to be 40, 50 feet.   
 Q.  42 feet, yeah.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, that was awesome.  It was one of those that was tracking the whole way, and it went right in the middle.   
 Q.  How would you describe this year for you?  We've followed you a lot, and you've had some really good rounds and good tournaments.  You've got to feel like you're getting really close to getting back in the winners circle?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I've played a lot better than kind of than my results have shown.  My game is there.  I say that every week, my game is there, and now it's a matter of going out and executing it.   
It seems like the whole year I've put together three good rounds and then one bad one or two.  So hopefully this will be the week to put four together.   
 Q.  Tell the listeners what it's like to stay at The Greenbrier.  I know your wife's here.  How much fun is it -- I mean, obviously you're here for golf, but there is a lot of other stuff to do?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: We love The Greenbrier, it's one of our favorite places, one of our favorite stops.  There is so much stuff to do.  The golf is great, the people are great.  I love playing here.   
 Q.  When you plan a schedule, do you ask the wife, and The Greenbrier, the extras are something you consider.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, absolutely.  I have a little son, and over the next couple years I'm sure he's going to grow and love this place.  This is an automatic for me for the start of the year.
