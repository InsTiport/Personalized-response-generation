 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I've made double on that hole more than I have on any other in my Masters career.   For real.   I hit a perfect drive, kind of left it out to the right, kind of flubbed my chip, double.   It happens pretty quick on that hole.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's difficult because you know you have such a tough stretch coming.   2 is a birdie hole, but then ‑‑ 3's good.   But then 4 through 9 are just brutal.   10, 11.   You know you got a tough stretch.   
I just wanted to hang in there.   I did a really good job of hanging.   I'm proud of my score today.   It could have been 6‑, 7‑over pretty easily.  
   
 Q.   Feel much better to have the 36 on the back nine so that you come in playing pretty good golf rather than the other way around?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, the up‑and‑down I did on the last hole was ridiculous.   That was as tough of an up‑and‑down you're going to have here at Augusta.   So I'm pretty proud of that.   All it takes is one decent round here and you're back in contention.   
   
 Q.   Standing on the first tee, your feelings today, if you can remember back to your first Masters, how is it different now?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's about the same.   It's exciting.   I don't get that nervous on the first tee.   I do kind of out on the course, but it's so exciting that first tee here at Augusta, at any Major, really, but there's a buzz in the air, they have the big scoreboard right there.   It's kind of‑‑ if you don't enjoy that, you won't enjoy golf, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   What hole makes you really nervous?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   12 is tough because the wind is swirling and you catch the wrong gust you could hit it in the back bushes or land in the middle of the pond.   It's a tough hole.  
   
 Q.   There were only six birdies there today.   You made one.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I did.   I hit a really great shot in there.   I know that green's a little slower than the rest of them, that gives me a little extra hit.   It was a good birdie.   Really good birdie.   Hit a little 8.   It was into the wind pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Some other guys at 3 aren't as optimistic as you are right now, but you're not that far off, there's not that many crazy scores today?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, the course is playing really, really tough this afternoon.   Really tough.   So I believe in what I can do tomorrow, I'm just going to go out and shoot around under par and I'm in decent shape.
