 Q.   Keegan, you got off to the start you needed, just a tough day overall, just comment.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I didn't play that bad.   Just some really strange putts, and then I just kind of limped in.   Wasn't a very good finish.   
   
 Q.   You had the momentum going on the back.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was a good putt, the second putt, it just wiggled right on me, dead center.   Might have been a little gust of wind or something but it pushed it to the right and then I just ‑‑ wasn't a good third putt.   Good fourth putt.     
   
 Q.   What do you do, there's a lot going on out there, Tiger's taken off the golf course, the lead is changing?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   What happened to Tiger?   
   
 Q.   He hurt his knee?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I didn't know that.   
   
 Q.   But there's a lot going on; Rory is up ahead.   Is it still easy to focus?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I didn't even know any of that was going on to be honest with you.   I did a good job of staying in the present there.   Sometimes it's tough when you fall out of contention, when you've been kind of in it all day to finish off.   I've got to learn how to do that a little better than I have these last couple weeks.
