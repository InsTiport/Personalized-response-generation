Q.   Well, Keegan for a moment there, trying to make a run at the leaders.   Tell us about the conditions, the bright sunshine with that chilly breeze running through here? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I, again, for the third or fourth week in a row, I feel like I've played better than I've scored.   But it's all good going into The Masters.   I'm feeling really good out there. 
I hit a decent shot today.   Tiger and Rickie are playing really well, but I'll take some positives out of this.

Q.   What is it about this course and this layout that makes it just so challenging at every turn here? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's just any mediocre shot is penalized.   It's a tough golf course, and in this wind, it makes it extra tough.

Q.   How much fun to play at Mr.Palmer's event? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   A lot of fun.   I'd like to thank him a lot for a great week from all of us players.
