  Q. Keegan, four birdies, one bogey, a solid 67 opening round. How do you feel?  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: I feel great. I had a great pairing today with Johnny. It was a really fun group out there. It was a good day.  
  
  Q. The rookie stars of this year, all three players have won this year. You're the youngest player to win on the PGA Tour this year. Maybe were you asked this question after the Nationwide Tour last year. You knew you were graduating up to the PGA Tour, what do you expect at the halfway point next year? If you had been asked that question, what would you have said?  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: I would have been very happy with where I am right now.  
  
  Q. No, no, that's not the question. What would you have -- what would you have wanted and been acceptable?  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: I would have been acceptable with everything until I won. Now that I won, it makes it even better.  
  
  Q. Now you can just go to the beach.  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Fish a little bit.  
 It's a great feeling.  
  
  Q. You've exceeded all your expectations. Do you have to move the goals now?  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Little bit, yeah, some things change, but I set a group of goals before the year started and there's still a bunch of goals that I would like to achieve. I've got plenty more work to do.  
  
  Q. You've had a successful year. You have to adjust to the golf courses, being able to adjust your game to them and what's hardest part about that?  
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's the toughest part about being a rookie, you really only get to see the course one time because we're not in the Pro-Am. That's the toughest part is getting out here, getting your rest in, too. That's the hardest part of getting used to these courses. Us three have done a good job of doing that.  
  
  Q. Go get some rest. You earned it. Good playing and good luck this week.
