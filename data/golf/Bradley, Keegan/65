  KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was a good week.  I played really well.   Q.  It seemed like you couldn't get some putts early on in the week to go.  And even today it was a little bit of a struggle?  KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, today was, yeah, just a lot of burned edges.  I just hit a lot of good putts that just didn't go in.  But hopefully next week they'll all go in.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  KEEGAN BRADLEY: I have no idea.  I don't know.  I'll have to wait and see.   Q.  It is interesting how much it changed from the BMW Championship to now, a lot of different names are being bandied about now with Horschel and Chris Kirk and Henley on the top of the board this week?  KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I mean the depths of the Americans is really, really strong right now.  I think there could be 15 -- 10, 15 guys that could play on this team.  So they're all capable of playing really well.  If they do make the team and I don't, I hope they win.   Q.  What were the fans like out there?  KEEGAN BRADLEY: The fans were unbelievable.  I've never felt anything like it, even coming here last couple of years.  But today, this week, was something that I'll never forget.  I really was amazed at how I was treated this week.  And it really meant a lot.
