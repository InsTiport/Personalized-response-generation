THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Keegan Bradley, making your ninth start here at the Travelers Championship.  Top 10 back in 2017.  Never missed a cut in the event I noticed.   
Just some thoughts on being back here and playing in obviously a part of the country very near and dear to you?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I love coming and playing here at Travelers.  It's one my favorite events.  I've seen the tournament grow so much in my nine starts, and it's become one of the premier events on the TOUR.   
Just very proud of the people and Travelers who run this tournament.  They've made this home tournament of mine into something special on the TOUR.   
THE MODERATOR: As far as your season goes you've had a couple Top 10s, both in World Golf Championships events.  Just assess your season.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I'm excited to keep playing here.  I haven't quite had the year I wanted, but that can change pretty quickly in one week.   
For me to be back here in New England playing, it's rejuvenating, so exciting to be back here.   
THE MODERATOR: How did the course set up?  You had a chance to get out and see it this morning.  Is it in as good a shape as everybody is saying?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I mean, it's stunning.  I just cannot believe the condition the course is in.  This tournament is just so -- from top to bottom just incredible.  When we come and we get to play on a course and greens in this condition, it's such a bonus.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  Talk about this year.  Seems like you've been on the cusp of playing some of your most consistent golf in your career, just pushing it for all 72 holes.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it's a strange thing, because in my mind I feel like I've had a good year.  Results-wise it hasn't been what I've wanted.  I've had good days and not good weeks.   
So if I can just put the four days together I think this has been a good year.  I got some big tournaments left with a lot to play for, so that's a good thing.   
 Q.  Do you get a sense how players are adjusting to the new schedule?  Anything different in terms of how you prepare or go through the season?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Right, yeah, it's much different for sure for us.  It's very condensed.  Seems like you're playing majors every week all of a sudden.   
But it's great.  The schedule this year has been great.  We've been playing on the same type of grass now for a month or so, which is much different.  Normally going from bermuda to poa or whatever.  It's been very consistent, and that's been nice.  I have enjoyed that part of it.   
But it's tough because the different -- U.S. Open, PGA, and we're going to the British.  It's a lot in a short period of time.   
 Q.  What is your schedule coming up?  Are you going to stick to it or changing a little bit on the fly?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: You know, I added Canada, but as of now I'm going to play here, 3M, British Open, and Memphis, the playoffs.   
Like I said, there is a lot to play for here.  We're lucky to play on this TOUR.  There is so much at stake every week, and only gets bigger and bigger as the year comes to a close.   
 Q.  With all the stats that we have in sports now, metrics in every sport, golf is the same way.  Everyone analyzes every little thing you do.  What in your mind, when you look back at a round or a tournament, is most important statistically to you?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Well, I do look at my statistics, but for me the most important statistic is the final score.  I look at so many times where all my stats are above strokes gained and I shoot 71 and who cares?   
Some days I'm shooting 67 and maybe I didn't drive it as well but I putted great.  I mean, for me, the most important stat is strokes gained putting.  Normally when that's around even is when my scores are lowest.   
For me, sounds stupid, but that final score, you can get so caught up in the stats that the final score is the most important.   
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Thank you.
