 Q.   They say par is a pretty good score around here.   How did you feel about today?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I felt really good.   I didn't play particularly well and shot 69, which is a really good sign.   I'm going to hit the range here after lunch and get some stuff worked out.  
   
 Q.   Anything in particular you feel like you need to address?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I just‑‑ I didn't feel that comfortable over the ball, but I'm very proud of my score.   I hung in there.   This is a tough course.   I made some good pars coming down the end.  
   
 Q.   A lot of people talking about the drivers becoming insignificant on this course?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's becoming insignificant on every course, but definitely here.   It's not a big factor for sure.  
   
 Q.   Jim Furyk leading right now.   I mean, he's way down the list as far as driving distance.   Is it that kind of a course?   Is it his kind of course?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, totally.   It's a U.S. Open type course.   You know, he's a U.S. open champion.   No one is surprised to see Jim Furyk on top of any leaderboard.   
   
 Q.   After you made the turn, you seem to get a few things working pretty well with three birdies there.   Anything you were doing differently?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I hit a few good putts on that back side, made a few birdies.   I hit the ball in the fairway a lot more on the back.  
   
 Q.   So is that kind of the key, just saying out of the rough?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, you just got to stay out of in rough and hit as many greens as possible.   To do that you have got to hit it in the fairway.
