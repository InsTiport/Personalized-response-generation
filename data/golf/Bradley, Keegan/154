  KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It feels good.   I think it was a pretty good defense, when all is said and done.  
   
 Q.   The way the course was set up throughout the week, was this a fair test for you guys, maybe excluding Friday?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I think it was.   Friday they didn't have control of that wind, so that was the toughest round of golf I've ever played.   I think the course was set up very well every single day.   I think the PGA should be proud.  
   
 Q.   Phil mentioned the difficulty for the fans, not just walking the course but to get here.   Excluding this, could this be a rotation for a major and the PGA Championship down the road because it was a fair test for a championship?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I mean, it's a tough tournament in general for I think everybody, but I think every once in a while it's a great spot with weather like this.   This is very nice.   
   
 Q.   Obviously the Playoffs and the Ryder Cup are coming up.   What do you take from this week?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm playing good golf.   I didn't putt very well all week.   If I had putted decent I think I would have been up there.   But very, very proud of myself, especially shooting 77 in the second round.   I battled back, bogeyed the first hole today.   I felt very tired today for the first time.   So I'm very proud.   
   
 Q.   Speaking of Ryder Cup, did you watch it growing up?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I went to the '99 Ryder Cup.   Greatest sporting event I've ever been to, so I'm really looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, that was No.1, no doubt.  
   
 Q.   What does the Ryder Cup mean to you in general?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Ryder Cup means everything.   It's going to be a real challenge for me that week to stay calm and not get too excited.   It's a great event.   I can't wait to play.  
   
 Q.   Are you excited that it's here in the States?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I think that's going to be great.   I think we've got one of the best teams in a while.   I think a lot of really good guys, we're all very close.   I think it's going to be a good match.   
   
 Q.   What do you know about Medinah in general, that course?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't know much.   I've got to go play a few practice rounds.   I'll get there early and get some scouting down.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the parkland setup and the doglegs?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, sure.   I love everything.
