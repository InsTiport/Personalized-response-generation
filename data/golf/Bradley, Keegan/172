Q.   I thought that was a well-played final round.   The golf course was considerably tougher today. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was.   I played very well.   I just wish I could have been a couple lower.

Q.   I thought the putt at the par-5, 13th was really key in your round.   You're coming off the birdie at the 12th, and on 13th you have an eagle chip.
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   It was just some of the putts didn't go in today, but they've been going in.   I feel really good going into the Masters.   That's all that matters.

Q.   Let's talk a little bit about the Masters.   You should carry a lot of momentum and confidence.
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I feel great.   I'm hitting the ball great, good preparation for next week.

Q.   Do you and Phil have a practice round together next week?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Probably.   Anytime I can get around Augusta with Phil, I'll take it.

Q.   Keegan, just comment on your week and also your round today.
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   I played well all week.   Just a few short.   Felt good all day.   Just not quite the finish I was looking for.
