Q. I've been so impressed not just with your scores or your birdies; you've only had two bogeys the entire week, one in each the first and the second round. That consistency has to really make you happy.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah. Yesterday was so tough. Today I played even better than yesterday, so this is two really solid rounds. I'm pretty pumped.
Q. Did the conditions change much between the first and second rounds for you?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it's less windy today. Yesterday was some of the strongest wind I've ever played in. Today was like a normal really windy day.
But it's just a tough track right now. Normally the scores are pretty low here and they're not this week.
Q. How important is it to keep the ball in the fairway this week?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's everything. This course is all hitting it in the fairways, especially with ball in hand, and you can make birdies, but more importantly make pars in this weather.
