 Q.   Four birdies and an eagle.   Sounds like a good start.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's kind of a relief.   The first probably 12 holes in my round have been reminiscent of the last three or four weeks, just right there, right on the edge, lip‑outs and playing well and not getting much out of it.   Then I had a nice explosion there to get a nice round under my belt.   Feels really food.   It's a relief a little bit.   
It's nice to make some birdies and eagles coming in.   
   
 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I definitely did.   I was thinking right where I had my birdie putt on the last hole today was where I had a birdie to win the tournament, so weird stuff today.   It's good vibes.   
   
 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was relatively close but, you know, I was back a little further and behind those trees.   It was weird, similar shot I had to hit.   
   
 Q.   What is it about this course that suits you so well?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I like that you get to drive it well out here.   If you do drive it well, you're going to have a lot of good birdie looks and finally I was able to convert some of those and hit good iron shots coming in.   
   
 Q.   Keegan, I know you're playing behind Matt and not with him, but you know how it is playing another tournament a week after a victory.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's impressive.   I didn't do that at the Memorial after I won here, so it's a tough thing to do.   He's won three, four times, so he's more used to it than I am, but that's a great round, and I'm happy for him.   
   
 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Compared to last year when it was blowing it was a lot easier.   It's more fun to play it like this.   This course‑‑ if you play well, you can score but you can also find yourself struggling to make pars and hit greens in regulation.   So anytime you shoot a round in the 60s it's a good score.   
   
 Q.   Driver on to the green at 11, did that get you going?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   That was awesome.   I hit a great shot at the flag and it rolled down that hill and it was a good 2‑putt.   It was a big 2‑putt in my round because I was struggling and it got me back on track.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, sir.
