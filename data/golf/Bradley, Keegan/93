Q.   Talk about how narrow these fairways are with the bunkers coming in really tightly, but those bunkers don't exist for you.   You hit the ball so far, it must be a huge advantage?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it is a big advantage, but I'm also hitting the ball super straight.   It's hard to remember a time where I've been more dialed in than these last two days.

Q.   We've just noticed on your back nine now it must be fun when a golfer gets to that level where you're pretty much hitting everything the way you want to hit it?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was.   These last two days, today included, were a couple of the best two days I've had since I've been out here.   I'm really in control of my ball and putting the ball really well.

Q.   What is it you like about this golf course? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It is challenging.   It's very tight.   You have to drive the ball straight.   But like you said there are a lot of holes I can hit drivers over and parâ€‘5s are reachable for me.   So it's a really good course for me.
