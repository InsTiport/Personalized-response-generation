 Q.   A lot of pars on that card offset by two birdies and an eagle.   Tell me about the 9th hole.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I had 56 yards, and you can't see the flag so I just was relying on the crowd, and they told me it went in.  
   
 Q.   You had such a spectacular rookie year.   For many players that would be a career year.   Is it hard to set goals coming off of a Rookie of the Year, two wins and a major win?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, not really because I still want to keep winning golf tournaments and contending, and there's always room for improvement in golf, as everybody knows.  
   
 Q.   Had to be a great Christmas.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was.   I was able to give my mom‑‑ tell her she was caddying for me in the par‑3 tournament, so she was psyched.  
   
 Q.   The par‑3 tournament at Augusta?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   At Augusta.  
   
 Q.   How is Aunt Pat doing?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Pat is doing great.   We talk regularly, and she's been really helpful these past couple months just getting ready for the season.  
   
 Q.   Really good ball‑striking round, 16 greens on this windy golf course.   You were in control of the golf ball.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, this is one of the best ball‑striking rounds of my life to be honest with you.   I actually putted really well, I just had a lot of putts that lipped out.   Hopefully they'll go in the rest of the week.   
   
 Q.   How are you adjusting to the greens?   They're very, very grainy.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I actually really like the greens Bermuda and grainy.   Being from New England, I putt Bermuda greens better than bent these days.   I actually love them.  
   
 Q.   You haven't had any trouble reading them?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I mean, they're tricky, yeah.   I had a lot of putts that just burned the edge, so I guess they are tricky.   But I am reading them pretty well.
