  KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Just didn't play really well today.   Just was pretty ugly.  
   
 Q.   Were you just not feeling it or did one mistake cause you to lose some confidence?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I didn't hit fairways today, and I hit a couple balls in the water, a couple bad breaks.   I got a bad break on 18.   But I'm still only three shots back with one round to play.  
   
 Q.   Going into tomorrow three shots back, how do you regroup and refocus?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, I've just got to put that behind me today and kind of go out tomorrow and pretend like it's the first round again.   I've got to shoot something really low.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the shift in momentum at 12 where Ryan hit first, hit it in the water and then you hit it short and into a back bunker and how that played out?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, in the third round we're not really too worried about what each other is doing, but just hit it in the rough there and came out really slow, went in the bunker, plugged in the hazard, and I kind of chopped it out.   I didn't think it was going to come out as hot as it did, and I made double.  
   
 Q.   The first two days you talked about how many fairways you hit and that's a classic if you hit the fairway there you probably don't have much problem at all?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, just not enough fairways today.
