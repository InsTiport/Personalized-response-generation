 Q.  Congratulations, Keegan.  Your first victory in six years, your fourth career victory.  How difficult is it to win out here on the world's greatest stage?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's so hard.  I'm so -- this is just incredible.  It's been a hard road back, and this is just -- I just can't believe it.  It's so great.   
 Q.  You're so emotional right now.  Your first victory with your family here with you.  What does it mean to be able to come all the way back and come full circle with Jillian and get the job done?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I've been dreaming of doing that forever, so I'm just -- I'm speechless.  It took a lot of hard work.  A lot of people helped me, Darren one of them, Greg, Srixon, all my sponsors.  I don't really know what to say.  I'm just so happy.  Thank you to everybody.   
 Q.  And you're going back to East Lake for the first time in five years.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Thank you.   
 Q.  You were in front of the leading group, and how mindful of that were you?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I was.  I don't normally love to look at the leaderboard, but in this situation with so many guys, I was watching all day.  I felt really comfortable.  This has been a long time coming, so I'm thrilled.   
 Q.  Are you ready to get the 10 mill at East Lake?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I am, actually.  I don't even know what I went to, but man, things changed a lot here this week.
