Q. 10-under par through two days; your thoughts on what's going down in Vegas?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, my game feels really good.  I've been playing good for a while now.  It's nice to see some results.
Q. You've been trending in the right direction; what has been the catalyst?  You had a top 10 in Kuala Lumpur, played well in Napa, finished the season pretty solid.  What's the key?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I've been working with my coach Darren May back home and putting a lot of work in, and some changes, and they're finally coming together.
Q. You were privy to an ace, and I saw one, two and three in the same hole in the same group.  Have you seen that before?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: No, I never have.  I made 2 on the hole and lost the honor, so that was incredible.  I've never seen a 1, 2, 3.
Q. Last week your good buddy Jon Curran got married.  Good times last week?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it was amazing.  We had a fun time in New England.  It was cold, but we had a great time, and happy for him.
Q. Looked like a pretty smooth second round for you.  What was it like?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was great.  I got off to a really good start and putted well, made a couple good putts early on, and then really just kind of coasted on my back nine.
Q. Last year wasn't necessarily the finish to the season that you wanted; you had a bit of an extended break.  How big was that not just for your game but also mentally to recharge?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was big.  I had some opportunities to go over and play in some other countries, and I decided not to just to kind of work on my game and be home and practice.  It's paying off.  I'm really happy with where my game is at.
Q. What's the run of the start of the season been like for you with Napa and then Kuala Lumpur?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's been great.  I've actually been playing well for a while now, but it's good to see some results coming.  This is as well-rounded of a two rounds as I've played in a long time.
Q. And you have a lot of balance on the course and off the course with your buddy Jon Curran just getting married, your marriage coming up in a month, however you've been able to fit everything in?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I've basically been around the world once, and I've been to three weddings in the last month.  It's been a tough run, but a lot of fun.
Q. Can the wedding planning or the excitement of that be any part of this little resurgence of your game?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, definitely.  It's been fun.  It's crazy to that's happening so soon, but it was great to see my buddy Jon get married, also my buddy George.  I was in his wedding right before Napa, so I've been in the wedding circuit for sure.
Q. It helps, I guess, good some good results on the board early, taking heat off and pressure, so you can feel good going into that part of the year?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, for sure.  I got off to such a slow start last year, it was tough to kind of fight back, so now I'm putting myself in a position to be kind of out ahead, and it's awesome.
