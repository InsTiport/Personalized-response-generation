Q.   How would you describe the way you two are playing? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Today we played so good.   We were two down early.   Could have been a lot more.   We hung in there and we battled and we pretty much birdied out from about the fifth hole.   It was tough to beat us today. 

Q.   You and Keegan in the second session took care of Jason Day and Graham DeLaet, and you'll face them again this afternoon; does it make a difference when you've already seen a team before, or are you okay and comfortable with the way things are going right now? 
PHIL MICKELSON:   It's a challenge for us because yesterday we got really hot and they are going to want a little bit of revenge from yesterday.   Jason Day hits the ball so far and Graham DeLaet is one of the best ballâ€‘strikers we have on TOUR, so we are going to have a very challenging match because they are going to be as determined as ever to get that point back that we took from them yesterday.
