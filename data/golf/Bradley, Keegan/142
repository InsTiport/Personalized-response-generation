 KEEGAN BRADLEY   - 38-34
  72 Total.   +1 
  
JULIUS MASON:   Keegan Bradley, ladies and gentlemen, 38‑34 72, +1, today, Keegan.   Were you having a lot of fun out there today.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I played actually very well other than four holes.   A little disappointing to come out and shoot that number, but good thing is we've got another day tomorrow and we've got another fun night to night, so things are good.   
   
 Q.   With that run of three holes, obviously 4, 5 and 6, did you have some problems with the lines in the bunkers or did you just‑‑  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, I think it was 4, I was plugged in the downslope and I tried to hit this low bump against the hill and it miss‑hit the hill by just a fraction.   It was actually a very good shot.   
You know, then I hit another shot, I was on the downslope, I was kind of short‑sided.   I had some unlucky lies out there to be honest with you, but I played very well.   I could have really let it slip away and fought back and had a bunch of lip‑outs, too, and the round could have been better than it was.   
   
 Q.   Six shots back, how do you see your chances tomorrow?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   You know, PÃ¡draig is playing very well.   I've been six shots back before with less time, so I look forward to going out tomorrow and just making a million birdies and having a good time.   It's been a really enjoyable group.   Everybody is so nice and friendly and PÃ¡draig played great today.   If he plays the way he did, I have no chance, but I look forward to a nice challenge tomorrow.
