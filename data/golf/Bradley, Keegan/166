  THE MODERATOR:   Here with the defending champ, the first time you've been able to hear that, Keegan, and another good round on the course.   Tell me what the changes were today particularly with the conditions of the wind coming up.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   We got a good draw here, and I wanted to take advantage of it this morning.   I know the winds are picking up, 68 is a good run out here.   
   
 Q.   Overall tell me about the momentum from what happened here last year?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   A little bit.   I don't think it helps a great deal, just good vibes out here, definitely.   I know the golf course pretty well and know how to play well on it.   
   
 Q.   Overall your approach on the weekend, what will be your approach?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Shoot two pretty good low scores on the weekend‑‑  
   
 Q.   That simple?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, hopefully.   The wind will probably be up again this weekend, and that suits me well.   
   
 Q.   Keegan, for the first time defending I would say you're doing very well.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I'm happy with my position, obviously and I'm sitin' good for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   I thought the wind was swirling in the second round, only going to get worse today and later into the weekend?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I definitely got a good end of the wave here this weekend, so I wanted to take advantage of that.   
   
 Q.   Talk to me about control and trajectory.   I thought in your rookie season every ball you hit was a mile high and it's great to have that ability.   I think you're controlling the trajectory of the ball in your second season.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I hit a couple of good shots today and they landed in the swirling wind, especially on the back nine, tricky holes, so it was a good 18 holes.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about how you line up your putt.   You cock your head to the right.   Is that something you always do?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it helps me see the line a little bit better.   I have been doing that since I was a little kid.   
THE MODERATOR:   Are you right‑eye dominant?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I am, but it just helps me to see the line better.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the weekend and when the wind is going to below.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think knowing how to play this course in the wind is great.   
I did get a good wave in this tournament.   I had 27 holes without much wind, which is great.   
   
 Q.   What's the strongest part of your game?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I seem to be putting well on these greens, and that's huge.   But also I need to drive the ball at fairway, like I did last year.   
   
 Q.   Did the success last year give you confidence going into the weekend?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I think so.   I'm going to defend my first TOUR win as best I can, regardless of the wind.   
   
 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't care what it does, the wind.   I know I won this tournament last year in some pretty high winds, so I wouldn't mind if it blew.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Keegan.
