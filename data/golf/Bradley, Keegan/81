Q.   Second round 66, what was the key out there for you today? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I played really solid today.   I played really solid yesterday.   Shot a score that should have been a lot lower, so today felt really good.

Q.   Talk about the end of that front nine out there.   You had the shot on 7 and you shot the long putt on 9 as well. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, that was great.   That was fun.   I hit a really great shot into 7 and it worked out nice.   Made a long 40â€‘footer on 9.

Q.   What is the key going into the weekend here for you? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's good.   I wasn't feeling that great today.   I woke up with a little maybe food poisoning.   I wasn't quite sure.   I was pretty sick.   It was gross, but I'm feeling hopefully I can rest up tonight and feel better tomorrow.
