 Q.   ..on a day like today when he just starts like that.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, he just played so good.   His putting was amazing.   The putts he missed the front (indiscernible.)  
   
 Q.   So on the 7th hole he makes eagle, and it was almost like, Come on, dude.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I wanted to go over there and tackle him and break his putter.   
No, I love Jordan.   We've become good friends out here.   I'm happy for him.   He was pretty much unbeatable this week.  
   
 Q.   How do you stay motivated when a guy is playing that good?   What are you playing for?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm still playing to win.   Towards the end you know you have no chance, but I wanted to go out and make as many birdies as I could.  
   
 Q.   You had four rounds with the new putter.   Kind of assess this tournament with it and how you hit it.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, this was one of the biggest tournaments in my career, to be honest with you, to show myself that that putter is not an issue.  
Actually, probably the best I've putted all year.   It was a good surprise.   
   
 Q.   What's the biggest difference for you?   Different feel?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, setup is a lot different.   Stuff that I kind of took for granted almost I have to really focus on and dial in.  
But I'm really proud of the way I putted this week.   These greens are really tough.   They're super fast.   About as tough as it gets.  
   
 Q.   Now, it's a little shorter than what they normally make of it.   Just kind describe why that is.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, shorter than my belly putter?   
   
 Q.   No, I mean, the shaft of this putter is shorter than like the base model.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I have no idea.  
   
 Q.   All right.   Never mind.   A lot can be made of an 18â€‘man event, especially winning by 10 shots like Jordan did.   How much should we put into this win?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, no, the kid is playing great.   You have to look at his past three events.   He's almost won them all.   He's a great player.   I wouldn't look more into it other than he dominated this week.   
It was a performance that was unbelievable, and no one could beat him.
