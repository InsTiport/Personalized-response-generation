  THE MODERATOR:   We would like to welcome Keegan Bradley into the interview room after a 1‑under par, 69, Keegan, increased your lead today, that was good and if we could get rid of holes 1 and 18 for you, you would be set but give us your comment on the day.  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm happy with shooting 69, didn't feel comfortable today, just was a different feeling today going off.   The first hole is probably the easiest hole out here, I don't know why I keep making bogey on that hole.   It was a good round today, solid round, a lot tougher than it was yesterday, so I'm happy with it.   
   
 Q.   Keegan, is it strange to think you shot under par today and yesterday you were 9‑under?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I don't get too caught up in it.   Whenever you shoot rounds like that, people make a big deal out of it, more than I do.   I got 100 rounds yesterday from the guys, and one time in Nationwide I shot 61 and shot 77 the next day, so I wanted to go out ready and focused today and ready to shoot a good number.   
   
 Q.   How much more difficult was it today?   Was it a lot windier today in the afternoon?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Definitely.   The greens are firming up a little, they're still soft but firmer than yesterday.   
The wind was definitely more difficult, it was blowing, it was gusting.   But, you know, the scores were still there to get.   Anything under par I think from here on out is a pretty good score out here.   
   
 Q.   You talked about the tee shot at 18 yesterday, is it basically the same thing today, you think?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, Pepsi said he's going to put a yardage plate over there for me.   I'm going to hit good ones on Saturday and Sunday, I'm due, I don't know when the last time is I hit the fairway, but it's just a matter of commitment to go a line.   For me, I got to take it a little over the edge of the water.   So it's difficult because you know you have that bail out and I got a 4‑shot lead so the last thing I wanted to do was plop it in the water.   I bailed out‑‑ I didn't hit that bad of a shot it just got in the wind.   I thought it was going to be way left of where it was but I'm going to hit good ones Saturday and Sunday.   
   
 Q.   Your 6‑iron, you seem to have your best shots with a 6‑iron, is that your favorite club?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't know, I have hit a bunch of good ones with it this week.   I hit a lot of balls with my 6‑iron, but there is no real reason why that would be better than my others.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you were proud of what you shot yesterday but given the conditions today and given how you felt today is this a round that also you should be proud of, too?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm almost more proud of this round than yesterday because I didn't feel comfortable all day.   
I don't know what it was, I can't put my finger on it but, you know, I bogeyed the first hole, I was a little uncomfortable and then I settled in and hit some really good shots.   I think that bodes well for the weekend, coming off two missed cuts and all that, it felt good to go out there and play well, and increase my lead which is all that really matters at this point.   
   
 Q.   And no Dufner hi jinks today?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, I kept my bag with me when I went to breakfast.   When I went to go stretch out with my trainer, I put it in the corner, not in the locker room so he couldn't find it.   I made the proper precautions today.   
   
 Q.   Can you reveal what you took out of his bag yesterday?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I took his shoes, his sneakers, and I put 'em in Tiger Woods locker in the champion's locker room.   He was texting me where are my shoes, I didn't respond, took him a while to get 'em but he found 'em.   
   
 Q.   Keegan, has winning crept into your head and if so how special would that be to win again in such a short span of time?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I can think about it a little bit but we have two more rounds to play.   I certainly like my chances, I love this course and obviously the position I'm in is great but I'm going to have to play really good golf to win the tournament.   
3‑shot lead with two rounds to play is a huge positive.   
   
 Q.   You seem to be a really good player in difficult conditions.   Would you like the wind to blow this weekend?   Or would you rather it be a birdiefest?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   When I won here it was the hardest‑‑ other than Kapalua this year, it was the hardest wind I've ever played in, so I don't think anybody wants it to blow 35 miles an hour, it could get a little silly, but I'm fine with it blowing a little bit, I've had some good tournaments this year in the wind and when it's tougher conditions the mentally stronger players come out, and I consider myself pretty strong so I would be fine with a little wind.
