 Q.   Stuck on 67, not a bad number.   Course is a little bit more difficult than last week's.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I got off to a pretty bad start today and I played really well coming in, so it feels good.  
   
 Q.   What's really the key out here?   It's such a different golf course than last week.   Here you can hit the best swing you made all week long and it still runs into that first cut.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I actually prefer it like this, a little tighter.   This is actually one of my favorite courses of the year.   I love it.   It's a challenging course.   I'm actually surprised the scores are as low as they are.  
   
 Q.   Is it more the mental process that you like about it or just the fact that it's just intimate?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I just like the whole thing.   It's a tough track, you've got to hit really good shots, and if you do, you get rewarded.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts going into the weekend?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think I'm in a good spot.   I feel like I'm still in reach of the lead, and I really like the way I'm playing, so I think it should be a fun weekend.
