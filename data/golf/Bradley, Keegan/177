Q.   How many times have you played this course? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I played 18 holes practice round and I played 18 holes when I was a junior here one time. 

Q.   Do you get any tips from Jim McClean coming down here?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, tons.   He gave me a long sheet of paper with what to do on every hole.   So he's been really helpful.   He walked all 18 with me and told me how to play it. 

Q.   So just with all that said, tough day with the wind, tough conditions to come out 3‑under.   Seemed like you battled pretty well out there today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I'm amazed at how low the scores are to be honest with you.   It's brutal out there, blowing hard.   Shows how good all these players are out here. 

Q.   Talk about your consistency this year.   Seems like you've just been playing at a consistent level, maybe more so than‑‑ more sporadic toward the end of last year, is that true, good observation? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I put a lot of work in on my short game and chipping and stuff, which is the reason why I've been kind of hanging in there this tournaments.   Like today, I didn't hit it that great but shot 3‑under, and it's because of my chipping, my short game.   So that, and being more comfortable, second year out here and knowing the courses a little better.
