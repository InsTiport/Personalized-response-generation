Q. Looks like you're really close to doing some spectacular stuff.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, my game feels really good.  A little bit of a fight there in the middle and I was able to hold on and post a good one.
Q. Yeah.  Ball striking looked good to me.  A lot of iron shots flying right at the flag.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, my game is really coming around.  It's going in the right direction pretty quickly.  This would be a great week to put it all together.
Q. How is your confidence at this point?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's good.  I'm playing every week.  I'm excited to get out here.  I just want to play and fight through this and hopefully -- I know if I play well I can contend every week.
That's my goal.
Q. Were those your boys in the T-shirts that said Keegan vs Everybody?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, those are the barstool sports boys.  They came out.  It was so fun.  Travelers, they treat me so well here.  They come out and support me.  It's great.
Q. Yeah.  Obviously anywhere in New England Keegan Bradley is a favorite.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, it's fun.  I had such a blast today.
