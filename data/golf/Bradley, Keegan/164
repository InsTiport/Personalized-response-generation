Q.   Keegan, talk about the birdie on 12 that bounced back. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, good putt.   I just got some bad breaks on 11, couple of 'em. 
Then it was a good birdie on 12. 

Q.   On 12, how did you play that hole? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   3‑wood, 9‑iron in the bunker and 9‑iron short and made birdie. 

Q.   Good hole to set up with a 3‑wood, you think? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, yeah. 

Q.   The way that‑‑ (Away from mic.)
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   No, it's definitely good.   I played very well today, other than one hole. 

Q.   (Away from mic.)
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I mean, I just tried to hit into that hill and get it in the bunker, and I figured if it somehow got past the first one there was another one there. 
I don't know how it got around both of them. 

Q.   After a hot day yesterday I was surprised to see you working out at the gym.   Talk about what that has meant for your overall fitness. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I feel good on the golf course; it's just to make me a better player, and he's helping me to do that. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Keegan.
