Q. You must be happy with your round today, 8-under.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I'm really happy.  I played well from start to finish.  I hit a little lull in the middle but finished up nicely.
Q. What were the conditions like today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Very hot.  They were great.  Course is in great shape.  Should be very proud of the golf course here.
Q. Are you used to playing in such shot weather?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Not this hot, but I live in Florida in the States and it gets hot.  But this is extreme.  This is really hot right now, yeah.
Q. The winning score last year was minus 26.  Do you see yourself having to make that score to stand a chance this week?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, you're going to have to shoot low rounds every day.  The course is in such good shape and the greens are so good, you're going to make a lot of birdies.  This is a great start.
Q. Did you feel like the conditions changed from the morning to later?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Not really.  It got hotter but conditions were really good for scoring.  Not a lot of wind and greens were soft.  It's good.
Q. Do you enjoy playing in this part of the world?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I do.  This tournament in Malaysia is incredible.  They treat us really well and it's all fun to come back here.
