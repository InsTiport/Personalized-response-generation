   KEEGAN BRADLEY: I'm only two back. The birdie on 18 was big. That felt really good. But, you know, I didn't play -- I played much better than that score. I could have been 5- or 6-under on the front. 

 Q. When you see your playing partners playing so well --
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: It was fun. I don't know if I've ever been in a group the first two day that is have been that many under, all three of us. I definitely haven't. It was really, really fun. Something I'll never forget. It was a really fun group for me. 
 It actually helps. It's not more pressure but it helps, it gets you going and it feels good to watch it. 

 Q. Feeling good about your position?
 KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I'm only two back. I feel great. I'm in a really good spot. I know I could shoot a really good number on this course again. Today could have been pretty good with just 2-under. I'm happy. 
 A lot can happen out here, and yeah, I know I can shoot another good one, definitely.
