 Q.  Happy with the day?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I am very happy.  I played -- it's probably one of my most complete rounds that I've played all year.  I don't normally feel as comfortable as I did out on the golf course today.  I felt very calm, and this is a course that can make you very uncomfortable, so when you have that feeling you can really go a long way.   
 Q.  Why were you so comfortable on the course today?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I don't know, I've been feeling so great on the course lately.  I haven't had the results really that I've wanted, but I have such a great -- my caddie Chad and I, he's doing such an incredible job.  I really credit a lot to what he's doing for me on the course.  I just feel great.  I don't know what happened last weekend because I felt great, but hopefully I can do a little better here.   
 Q.  Is that a new state of mind?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I don't know.  I just felt great today, and I felt great last week and didn't shoot the numbers I wanted to on the weekend.  But I can take a lot away from last week.  This is a course that can go in a lot of different directions, so I've got obviously a long way to go.   
 Q.  How big is that given last week at Bay Hill?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Well, it was good.  I didn't think much of it really.  I was really bummed out.  But I'm playing good golf, and good golf is rewarded on this course, good ball striking.  So I went out there today and did that and holed some putts, and it was a great day.   
 Q.  You had your best finish here last year.  Do you feel like you're learning this course better as you go along?  
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, early in my career I felt so uncomfortable on this course.  I really didn't play well here.  I didn't really enjoy -- it just wasn't a good fit for me.  And then last year and the year before I played okay.  I came in like maybe 30th.  I don't know, it was my best finish -- or 25th.  And last year I played great.  And then this year, I really enjoy the different conditions that we're playing in.  I like the rough better, and I think it's a great time of year to play here.
