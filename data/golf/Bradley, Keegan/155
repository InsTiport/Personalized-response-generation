  KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I'm still right in it, the lead is 4‑under and I'm only five back.   If it's like this, any round under par, you'll be okay no matter what.   
   
 Q.   So for two more days out here‑‑  
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Tiresome.   But I'm looking forward to it.   I'm so happy I made the putt on the last hole, it really felt good, and I'm in a good position.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to be able to make birdies in a wind like this or is it going to be more like a war of attrition with a lot of pars?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   You want to try to make as many pars as you can, but you definitely can shoot under par out here.   I mean, I watched a guy do it today.   So you know, I think that if the wind blows like this, you try to make as many‑‑ it's like playing in an Open, a British Open.   You kind of want to hang on and hopefully make a few putts.   
   
 Q.   Compare yesterday's perfect conditions to coming out and facing today and how prepared you were?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, I don't think anybody was very prepared, just because we never played.   There were a few holes that were just brutal.   I think that that stretch from about 7 to 13 is about as hard of a stretch of golf as there is in the world, I would think.
