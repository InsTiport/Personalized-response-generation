  CHRIS REIMER:   We want to welcome the winner of the last World Golf Championships, Keegan Bradley, who won the Bridgestone Invitational earlier this year.   
    Keegan, I know you've played the course today, I believe it was today with Phil, just some initial impressions on Mission Hills and the OlazÃ¡bal Course.  
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think the course is unbelievable.   And I was pleasantly surprised, I had never played it.   It's just a great golf course.   It's challenging but also you can score very well if you hit it well, and the greens are great.     
    So I'm really looking forward to it.   I was very happy with the way the course was laid out.     
    CHRIS REIMER:   Talk about going against this quality of field and in a World Golf Championships.  
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   As always, the World Golf Championships have an amazing field and HSBC puts on such an amazing golf tournament.   I think the stands and all their structures that they set up are unbelievable.   It's a special atmosphere, and as usual, a great field.   It's exciting to come to China and play against the world's best.   
    CHRIS REIMER:   First question from Bubba TV.  
  
    BUBBA WATSON:   As one of your biggest fans, the public would like to know what are you looking at when you're reading putts.   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Well, if I explained it to you, then I'd have to kill you.   So I don't want to give away‑‑ I don't want to give you any of my secrets.  
  
    BUBBA WATSON:   Okay, look, I'm going to leave the room.   You tell the rest of the world why ‑‑ what you're doing and whatever you're doing when you do that?   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Listen, it's the stink eye; don't get in the way of it.   It will burn you.  
  
    BUBBA WATSON:   So are you going to talk to Phil about him starting to do that?   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   He was actually doing it today.  
  
    BUBBA WATSON:   Since he's left‑handed, does he go the other way?   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, he goes the other way.   Thank you, Bubba.   (Laughter).  
    CHRIS REIMER:   Now time for some legitimate questions.   
   
 Q.   You've been wearing your visor all the time, so we don't see any visor now, so what's the story behind that?  
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   We had a bit of a shipping issue.   I should have visors and headwear today.   
   
 Q.   Bradley, Keegan, Phil was in here earlier on saying that the two weeks after The Ryder Cup was one of the most difficult of his career to accept.   Can I just ask what it was like for you?   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was really difficult, because you have such mixed emotions.   For me it was just such an amazing week, and then to see that we lost was tough.   I didn't watch any Golf Channel or read anything, because it was too difficult.   
    You know, I think it will help drive the U.S. Team to play even harder next year.   
   
 Q.   The other part of that whole thing with Phil was the fact that he just marvelled at how well he could play from the places you play from off the tee, and his focus now is to try to do something similar.   Do you find that, a, ironic, the fact that you are actually teaching Phil something that clearly he probably knew at some point in his career and lost because he hits it so far and didn't care; and b, have you guys talked about that, the way that you approach a golf course or the way you approach a hole, because Phil actually likes the idea of what you've been doing?  
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It's the first I've heard of that.   It's pretty unbelievable.   
    You know, I put‑‑ in the alternate‑shot format, I was putting Phil in some great spots, and Phil with a wedge or any sort of iron from the fairway is deadly.   If he's got a wedge and it's outside five feet, I'm shocked.   
    So I think he's going to try to focus in on getting the ball in the fairway more and in play, because he's the absolute best iron player I've ever seen.   If he can do that more consistently, he'll win so many times more and he'll be competitive well past and in his 50s.   
    But that's a huge honour to me that he would even say that to people.   I think that with Phil, it's ironic, because I learn so much from him, and for him to say that about me is amazing.   It's actually kind of shocking to me right now.   
   
 Q.   This event is the next gathering of The Ryder Cup with your teammates like Phil Mickelson and others.   Would a win from this tournament recover some of the pain that you feel from The Ryder Cup?   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it is pretty cool.   It's the first time I've seen any of the guys since The Ryder Cup.   It brings back such great memories.   
    My relationship with all of the guys is different.   It's much more‑‑ and I saw some guys in the airport yesterday, and it made me happy just to see the guys.   I think it would be great‑‑ a win here any time is amazing, and I think that it would help all of the Americans and especially myself.   
   
 Q.   I know you experienced it a little last year and probably more this year; is this whole idea of playing in the fall, people wanting to talk to what you're doing and knowing more; how difficult is that to adjust to where you were two years ago and a lot of people didn't know who you were, and now they look at you and see you as major champion and everything else.   
    KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I had another moment today where I was out doing kind of promo for the tournament with a smaller group of guys, and it's amazing that I'm even in that small group of guys that they pick upon to promote the tournament.   It just hits me that, again, this is an amazing journey that I've been on and I can't believe I'm here.   
    It can be challenging at times but I'm really kind of settling in now.   I'm going to be going into my third year on TOUR and I'm much more comfortable with all this attention than I was.   Sometimes it can be challenging, but I lean on Phil a ton for this stuff, and he teaches me very well.   
    CHRIS REIMER:   Thank you, good luck this week.
