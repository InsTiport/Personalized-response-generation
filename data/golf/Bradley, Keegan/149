 Q.   How does it feel to be paired with Phil tomorrow in foursomes?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It feels great.   I'm looking forward to playing with Phil.   We have a great relationship and I think it's going to be a great partnership.  
   
 Q.   How does your game fit into the foursomes format?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think it fits great.   I've never played so I'm going to find out tomorrow.   I pride myself on hitting fairways and Phil is a great iron player, so that seems to match up.   
   
 Q.   Have you played any practice round with Phil this week using the foursomes format?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yes, we did.   We did pretty well, too.   He's easy to partner with.   And I know if I just get him anywhere on that green, he's got a chance to make it.   
   
 Q.   Talk about playing against Luke and Sergio tomorrow.   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I think it's great.   Sergio and Luke have an unbelievable record.   They are both legends in The Ryder Cup, and I think it's going to be fun for me and Phil to go up against them.   
   
 Q.   One word to sum up what you're going to be feeling tomorrow on the first tee, first time in The Ryder Cup on home soil?   
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Excited.
