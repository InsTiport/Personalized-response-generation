Q.   This is a special place for you. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it feels very good.   I made such a great 5 on the last hole.   It feels like a birdie or an eagle.   The fans were so great.   It was really fun to be able to experience that for the first time in my career.

Q.   Really, to go back to yesterday, you had to birdie the last two holes to even be here this morning.   Tell me about last night. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I cleaned out my locker, had already looked at flights, so I felt like as soon as it was time to go, I felt like I was lucky just to be out here.

Q.   Tell me how the course is playing.   You made a lot of putts. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, the course is playing very nicely obviously in the morning, but I had Pepsi back on the bag.   He wasn't able to make the first two days because of a family emergency, so it just felt right out there again. 

Q.   How much did your mood change when you found out that you actually made the cut?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Oh, man, it felt so good.   I knew that I would have Pepsi back today, which was huge for me.   I was really looking forward to getting out there.

Q.   To get off to that hot start, how much did that kind of roll into the back nine?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Oh, it felt so great.   It felt good to make some birdies.   I made some good swings.   I called my coach Jim McLean last night and he kind of gave me a lesson over the phone, and it really seemed to help.

Q.   How big was that eagle right off the bat?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was so great because I hit two perfect shots in there.   That's a tough pin, but if you hit a good shot, you can hit it really close, and that's what I did.   It just felt so good because I had been making such bad swings, and it felt good to put a couple together.

Q.   Can you talk about the fact that halfway through the round yesterday it looked like you were going to miss the cut?   Talk about the last couple holes yesterday going into today. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, I made about a 30‑footer on my second‑to‑last hole, and made about a 12‑footer on 9, my 18th.   It just goes to show you that you've always got to keep grinding and finish out the race because you never know what can happen.

Q.   Talk about the finish today.   You come to the 17th one shot off the course record, and now you put yourself in contention here. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   You know, I hit a good drive on 17.   I was in a divot.   Wasn't that bad, but I think it was just a funky lie.   And then on 18 with this new pin, I figured I needed to hit something short and kind of have a hop up or else it would have gone long.   I missed that by probably two feet from being maybe just up front looking pretty good.

Q.   At what point in this round do you start thinking like I could shoot an amazing number, a record number? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   You know, I spoke to my‑‑ my mom told me that my grandmother wanted me to shoot 63 today, so I was out there thinking I had a good chance to do that for her.   This is her first tournament she's ever come to, so she was on 18.   So I needed to get up‑and‑down to make that putt to shoot 63.   I'm just happy with the number that I shot today.   I could have been lower, but also could be higher.

Q.   Talk about the second shot at 18. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it was just such an in between shot.   I don't know what I would have done.   I probably would have hit the same club if I went back.   I was expecting it to jump a little bit, and it didn't.

Q.   Can you talk about what you and Jim talked about last night, some insight?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I sent him a few videos of my swing because it was honestly pretty violent the first two days, the most lost I've felt on the course in a long time.   He just saw something in my upper body that looked a little weird.   And with me, I don't need these long drawn‑out lessons, I just like something very small, and that's what Jim is good at.

Q.   What was the key that unlocked things for you?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   It was just a timing issue.   It's hard to‑‑ it's a lot of feel, but Jim knows my swing better than anybody, and clearly it showed today.

Q.   In what way did Pepsi help you keep things together today?
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   I don't know, it felt so weird out there without him.   It felt so bizarre, and I realized how good of a caddie Pepsi is and how much I do rely on him out there.   It was a good eye opener for me in a lot of ways because when we were walking down the first hole, it just felt right, felt normal again.   It didn't feel hectic, it just felt normal.   I'm glad it happened because it made me realize, again, just how important he is.

Q.   You've got to feel a sense of satisfaction to play this well in front of this crowd. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah.   You know, I've had such opportunities to come to New York and here and play well in front of fans, and I finally got that chance today to really shoot a good round and hear the crowd going.   It meant a lot to me to hear everybody do that.

Q.   We've talked to all the people on the bubble for the Ryder Cup team.   What is it like when you've secured the spot?   Do you still feel urgency to go in hot, or is there a bit of a letdown, or can you just address that? 
KEEGAN BRADLEY:   Yeah, it feels so great to be on the team because this time last year I was really watching the leaderboards because I was right on the edge, just everything seemed to happen against me in order for me to miss the team.   It's great to be on the team.   But also I want to be playing well for the captain so he's got faith in me to win matches.
