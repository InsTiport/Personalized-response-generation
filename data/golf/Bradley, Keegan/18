Q. Give us your assessment, 2-under today.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, I played really well.  I didn't finish up very good but played well.  Course is playing tough.  It was a good round.
Q. Conditions a little bit swirly, wind is changing direction.  How challenging is it with club selection and distance control?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: It's hard, yeah.  I've under seen the course play quite this tough.  The greens are firming up and it's windy and it's gusty.  The scores are not that low this week.
Q. Colourful front nine with an eagle on 2 being the highlight.  Talk me through that eagle.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I hit a 5-iron in there from 235 or so straight downwind.  Hit it to like ten feet or maybe a little less and made it.  It was a good start to the round, that's for sure.
Q. Looks like you'll finish the day five shots behind the leader.  On this golf course with 18 holes to go, what are your thoughts about maybe a Sunday charge?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Yeah, Justin Rose is a great player.  He's going to be tough to catch, but you never know.  The course is tricky, so you can go out and easily shoot a couple over.  I've got to go out and shoot really low tomorrow.
Q. He did come back from eight back to win last year.
KEEGAN BRADLEY: Oh, he did.  Okay.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.
Q. How do you feel you're playing this week?  Is the swing feeling solid?  Are you happy with your game?
KEEGAN BRADLEY: I've played really well all week from first round till now.  Just got to go out tomorrow and keep doing what I'm doing.
