Q. Logan, 4-under 67 at Pebble Beach.  What has been working for you?
LOGAN LOWE: It started early with my driver.  I ripped one on No. 2 and No. 3 and the driver felt good.  I got it in play after a start at Spyglass yesterday where I was all over the place.
The swing felt good today so I could stay aggressive.
Q. You made four birdies in the last five holes of your front nine.  How did you make those birdies?
LOGAN LOWE: On 5 I hit a 7-iron to 11 feet and made a little right-to-left putt.
On 6 I hit 3-wood, 6-iron to about 24 feet and two-putted for birdie.
On 8 the hole was on a ridge and I hit it about 17, 18 feet away.
On 9 I ripped a drive to about 170 and hit a punch 9-iron to four feet.
Those birdies gave me a lot of confidence, especially in the meat of the course, which I think is 3 through 10, and it's long and there's wind.
