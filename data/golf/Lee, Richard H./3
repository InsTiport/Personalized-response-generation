  Q.  How good was it?   
 RICHARD LEE:  I'm happy. It feels like I struggled today. I hit it good but I missed a few short putts. It just didn't quite click, wasn't as good as the first two days.   
  
  Q.  Do you try to analyse that?   
 RICHARD LEE:  Mate, I'm going home, lie in my bed and watch some TV. I'm going to hit some balls later on. But I won't be analysing it today.   
  
  Q.  Some of the pins were tough today?   
 RICHARD LEE:  The one on 16 was really tough. Hit it to the right and made a good two putt. It was good.   
  
  Q.  You're in a good position?   
 RICHARD LEE:  We'll see how it goes. I'm sure I'll be a bit nervous tomorrow as I've not been in that position for a while. I'm relishing this, I'm enjoying this, hopefully the good form will continue.   
  
  Q.  Have you received any encouragement from back home?   
 RICHARD LEE:  Lots. I've been getting lots of text messages, a few calls. My wife just says keep it going. She's Japanese and her family in Japan have been following the internet and my mum too. Everyone's happy. I'm sure they'll be watching.
