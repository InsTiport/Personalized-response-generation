 Q. 3-under 68, birdie on 18.  What was working for you today?RICHARD H. LEE: You know, I had a good control over my ball today, and yesterday, actually.  Actually all three days really, and the difference between the first day and the last two days were just holed a few more putts and got up-and-down when I needed to, kept the momentum going. So today, I did a good job of just kind of being patient and then going through the process and hitting good shots, and kind of just letting results be results.  I thought I did a good job of just kind of taking it one by one throughout the day.
Q. And throughout the tournament, have you noticed any big differences in the course, the way it's been playing?RICHARD H. LEE: Greens are definitely firming up, so it's getting tougher.  Rough is obviously growing a little bit more.  I don't think they have cut it ever since the first round.  The course is drying out, which kind of helps, because the course is playing a little shorter but the second shots to greens are definitely tougher.
Q. Going into Sunday, what are you focussing on for tomorrow?  You're right in the middle, swing of things, find yourself in the hunt.  What are you really focusing on to try to come out on top?RICHARD H. LEE: Honestly the same thing, trying to pull through the process.  I think I've been in this situation a couple of times where I've kind of learned from it, so try to apply and the key is to just be patient and do what you can control and let the results be results.  So you know, obviously I want to have good results, but only thing I can control is to go through my process tomorrow.  This game definitely you need some luck here and there, too.  So just going to do what I can control and see what happens.
