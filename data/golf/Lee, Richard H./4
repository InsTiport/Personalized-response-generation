  Q.  Tell us about your day, you must be pleased?   
 RICHARD LEE:  Disappointed actually. Played really well. Made a couple of mistakes, my chipping let me down today. Had three makeable up and downs and missed them all. Still made six birdies and four bogeys, overall I am still happy. Could have been better. It was nice to get the birdie on the last.   
  
  Q.  Are you kicking yourself for that up and down back nine?   
 RICHARD LEE:  Yeah, it sort of went birdie bogey or bogey birdie. Like I said, made a couple of mistakes. Like on 14, I got aggressive there and hit a really good shot there. In hindsight, should have hit a six iron and be a bit short and make birdie or par. Got to the back and had a fluffy lie which I duffed.   
  
  Q.  What made you get aggressive?   
 RICHARD LEE:  I don't know. I do play quite aggressively. I rather have a short birdie putt. Maybe I'm a risk taker, put it that way.   
  
  Q.  How much harder was it out there?   
 RICHARD LEE:  I didn't think it was much harder. This afternoon, the grass seems to have grown more quickly and there was more grain on the greens. I don't think it was playing much harder at all.   
  
  Q.  You're still in a nice position, are you going to enjoy the weekend?   
 RICHARD LEE:  It's all good. Hopefully I'll be talking to you again on Sunday.
