Q.   Much improved today in these conditions.   Talk about the conditions and how well you played. 
FRANK BENSEL:   I hit the ball a little bit better, I guess a little bit better off the tee.   I putted very nicely, had a lot of saving putts.   I don't even know how many up‑and‑downs.   But for me it was quite a few.   I avoided the big number, obviously didn't have any doubles today, yesterday had a bunch.   But I thought it was very hard, and I was able to keep it around the greens and get it in the hole.

Q.   What do you take from this week?
FRANK BENSEL:   Well, I mean, even though I didn't play the way I wanted to, I didn't hit the ball very good.   I'm still kind of confused as to how to hit the ball real solid.   But it was such a great time.   I mean, even when I was struggling, it was still enjoyable, and a great experience, trying to soak it all in, just being able to represent the PGA of America and all the club pros is an honor.   It's a great venue, and I'll have great memories of this for a long time.
