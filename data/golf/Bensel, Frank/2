Q.   Talk about today, obviously what went on out there. 
FRANK BENSEL:   Just wasn't hitting it well.   Just kind of lost what I was trying to do with my swing and made some doubles, a couple 5s on the front, and then I made a bad swing on 13, doubled that one, and a bad swing on 17, doubled that one.   Just kind of not a solid ball‑striking day.

Q.   What do you think about the golf course?
FRANK BENSEL:   It's good.   I mean, I was pretty bad.   It looked like there were some good scores out there.   I think if I would have played well, I would have had a decent score.   But not hitting it well is tough out there, you know. 

Q.   Goal, thoughts, what are you looking forward to tomorrow? 
FRANK BENSEL:   I just would like to hit the ball a little bit better.   At this point‑‑ I'm just going to try and come back and play better tomorrow, try and enjoy it.   It's hard to enjoy it when you're playing terrible.
