  MODERATOR:   Fulton Allem, 68, 2 under par.

Q.   2 under par round?
FULTON ALLEM:   Yeah.

Q.   Satisfying? 
FULTON ALLEM:   Yes, I played solid.   I never made any putts today.   I hit the ball pretty good.   I had a few good chances.   Missed quite a few for birdie.   Made one bogey on No.2.   I short‑sighted myself with an 8 iron.   Other than that, played solid.

Q.   Does that get to be mystifying, puzzling when you miss the ten‑footers? 
FULTON ALLEM:   It's something you expect.   The greens, it's late afternoon.   They're a little bit bumpy towards the end of the evening there.   Sometimes they go in, and sometimes they don't.   But I hit solid putts.   That's what more important.   I hit my putts solid.

Q.   At the end of the day, when you look at the scoreboard, you're close to the lead.   So at 2 under par at a U.S. Open.   So that's got to be nice. 
FULTON ALLEM:   Yeah, we've still got a long way to go, you know.   It's only Thursday.   You always just want to try to stay in touch and hopefully be there on the back nine on Sunday where you can give yourself an opportunity.

Q.   How was the course condition‑wise today compared to the practice rounds? 
FULTON ALLEM:   It's very much the same.   Still a couple of fairways are still a little soft, and the greens are nice.   I mean, it's very fair.   It's a very nice golf course.   I enjoyed playing it thoroughly.

Q.   Did it remind you of anything on the other side of the ocean at all?   Or maybe parts of it? 
FULTON ALLEM:   A couple of holes.   I like the old‑style greens.   They got lot of the old‑style greens tilted from the back to the front, which I kind of like.   They also give you the entrance into the greens, you can run the ball up into them.   So that makes it nice.

Q.   Thank you very much. 
FULTON ALLEM:   Okay.   Thank you.
