FULTON ALLEM:   It was kind of tough on the front nine earlier.  I got off to a slow start.  I bogeyed the first hole going straight down on it.  Jumped right back with a birdie on No.  2 and that kind of kept me Going going. And then I bogeyed 6.  When I birdied 8  -- I birdied 8 twice, and Duffy said, "Well, you're playing well.  Just keep going."  I got a little warm with the putter on the back nine. I hit some good iron shots in there as well and I putted nice. 


Q.  Annika Sorenstam shot 59 today  --

FULTON ALLEM:   Good for her.  Proud of her.  Well done, Annika.  That's excellent stuff.  Man, that's nice.


Q.  Eight birdies in a row and 28 going on the front nine.

FULTON ALLEM:  That's phenomenal.  I'm so glad that some woman has done it.  It's about time. 


Q.  Do you have any expectations going into the weekend? 

FULTON ALLEM:   Expectations?  I'll leave those to the media.
