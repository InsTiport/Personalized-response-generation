Q.   General comments on the round.

FULTON ALLEM:  Well, I'm not happy.  I could have shot a little lower.  I am not exactly razor sharp yet, but the game starting to come around.  It has been absent for the last five, six weeks.  It is starting to come around.


Q.   What made the course so tough out there today and playing so hard?  A lot of high scores today.

FULTON ALLEM:  I think it is muddy, tough to get the ball close to the hole.  Fairway is a little long and it is muddy, and you never know when you are going to get a flier or if you are going to spin one.  The greens are very soft; so if you had ideal fairways, today would be a good day for scoring but the fairways are a little mighty slow.  And the rough is very penalizing.  It is tough to make putts.  You are putting on... You know, these guys, most of us aren't used to putting on this kind of green.  Very strong grain on the greens.


Q.   Greens slow because they are wet?

FULTON ALLEM:  The thing is, it is hard to believe how hard you got to hit a four footer, you can't believe it, to get it through the grain.  Almost where it -- it almost turns around and comes back at you when it slows down. So I think the putting is tough.  Putting is tough out there today, and they are rough.


Q.   Is the grain stronger than your own in South Africa?

FULTON ALLEM:  Yes.


Q.   A lot stronger?

FULTON ALLEM:  It is very strong.


Q.   Do you have any problems with jet lag at all?

FULTON ALLEM:  No, I came from Orlando.  Same time.  I am about ready for tea.
