MOHAN DU: On the whole, I am happy with this score. The wind was as strong as always. My plan was safe and steady. It worked out. My long game was good and gave me many birdie chances. On the front nine, I had three birdies. I should say I was lucky because we played without too strong wind from the morning group. The wind picked up on the back nine. I had no birdie, but I think itâs okay.
The wind was expected to be strong tomorrow. I need to follow my conservative plan.
