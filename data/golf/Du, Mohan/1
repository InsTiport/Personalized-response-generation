MOHAN DU: I had more practice after the second round. I definitely made notes and learned. I was affected by strong wind that day. You know, I made the best use of the wind as well as the slopes today. Like some holes, I learned that I needed to add some 20 yards from the second round. It worked. I am totally happy with the round.   
The highlight should be No. 4. I nearly made a hole-in-one with 7-iron against the wind and had a tap-in birdie.   
The aim is top 10 tomorrow, but it would not be my burden. Top 50 is also good for me. It means that I made progress from Buick LPGA Shanghai.
