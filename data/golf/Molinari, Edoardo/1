 Q.  Great opening round.  Talk us through how it was for you?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I played quite good today.  I made a lot of putts.  I've been playing really consistent golf in the last, you know, two months probably, but I'm starting to putt much better.   Last week was quite good and today again was definitely another improvement.  So I'm very happy with my game at the moment, and just go day by day and see what happens.   
 Q.  You're getting great results from the putting, because two eagles on the back nine.  Can you talk us through the shots?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, the first hole was down behind and I hit a driver and 3-wood just on the left side of the green, and I had probably the easiest chip you can have because it was a bit high just in the left rough and hit a great chip and it went in.   
7, it was playing quite tough because the last putt of the round, the wind picked up a bit.  It was into the wind and I hit a good tee shot to the left.  I was lucky it just made it over the bunker and from there I hit probably my best shot of the day to four feet and made the putt.   
 Q.  So this is looking like some really good golf for you.  What do you think has sparked this great improvement in your game?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I think it's just consistency in my practice and what I'm doing on and off the golf course.  You know, I'm in a good place at the minute.  It seems like every week I'm playing better.  I'm building something every week, and when you play golf like this, it's quite easy, but then everything can change in a very short amount of time.  You just have to be careful and keep doing the same things, and hopefully the results continue to improve.
