 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Good, solid start. 

 Q. Did you have any thoughts going around or was it all golf today? 
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: No, I'm just trying to play golf. I think need to do extremely well this week to get a pick. So I was just trying to play golf and do my best. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on your round today?
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: I think I played very well. I wasn't playing this good the two weeks I was in the States, and today I finally hit the ball very well tee-to-green. I could have holed a few more putts. I missed a couple of short par putts on the third and fourth. I think I hit almost every fairway, every green, a lot of very good shots. I'm very happy about the game, and I just hope to putt better in the next three days.

 Q. Were you able to concentrate simply on golf? 
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Absolutely. I think I'm just trying to play golf and then we'll think about it on Sunday night. I'll just play golf this week and see what happens. 

 Q. So it's not a case of you've really got to win this week?
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: No, no, it's very difficult to -- I think if you want to win a tournament, it's even more difficult to do it. So I think you just have to play your best golf and hole some putts and then see what happens on Sunday.

 Q. Did you have any Ryder Cup conversations with your playing partners? 
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: No. I think the only one, I asked Miguel how far he was in front of Dyson, because Dyson was on the leaderboard and Miguel is a good friend of mine, so I hope he can make it. He said he had no idea, so I think he's very relaxed, as well. (Laughter).
