 Q.  4-under out there today at Kingsbarns.  How do you assess that round?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: It was a very solid round again.  I had a good start on the front nine and then the back nine, I think I played as good as on the front, but I missed a couple of putts coming in and just a couple of bad bounces.  That's quite normal on links courses at some point but I'll take 4-under and puts me in a good position going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  A few shots back from the lead, what's the mind-set with the early shotgun start?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: It's going to be very windy.  To be honest I was hoping it was going to be windy because I'm quite good when it's windy, and I don't like when it's playing too easy.   
It suits my game.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow and hopefully I can have a good round of golf around the Old Course and see what happens.
