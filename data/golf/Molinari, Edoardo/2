 Q.  How do you reflect on the week here in Ireland?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I think it was a very good week for me.  I'm playing very consistently.  I'm playing very well.  Finally this week I managed to make a few putts, and that made quite a big difference.   
 Q.  We've seen the last couple of results have been good for you.  Did you feel that form trending in the right direction  coming into this week?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, I think I've been making every cut since Morocco back in April, and every week I've improved a little bit.  I wasn't putting well up until a few weeks ago, and this week, I finally managed to make a few putts and obviously that reflects on the score.   
 Q.  A little side story obviously being The Open Championship, qualifying spots up for grabs.  How much has that been on your mind?  How much have you tried to not let it be on your mind?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: It was very much on my mind, because with Francesco defending, I really want to be there.  I think it's a shame because I think today will be one shot too many.  But, you know, all in all, it's a good week and it's another step forward in the right direction and if I keep playing this week, I'll be playing many more Open Championships.
