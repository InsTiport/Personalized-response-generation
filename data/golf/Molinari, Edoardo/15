 Q.   Tell us about having such a strong finish to The Irish Open.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It was a scrappy day to be honest, probably the worst I played of the week today but I managed to keep a score going and make some decent putts.   I was always missing on the right side, which helps.   All in all, I'm very happy this week, whatever is going to finish.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you're conscious of the board and the fact that nobody was moving away so your chance was still there.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It's that kind of course.   Doesn't look very difficult to the eye, but then it's difficult to make birdies and there's a lot of rough around the greens.   So as soon as you miss a green, you're in trouble.   Overall, I'm very, very happy.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling about yourself just in general terms; you had the layoff and then a little bit of time to build confidence.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Any time you have such a long time off, it's difficult to start again playing good golf.   Yesterday playing with PÃ¡draig in front of a lot of people, it almost felt like a major.   
When you can shoot under par in those conditions, it's always a big boost to the confidence.   As I said today, I think I was a little bit tired; I didn't hit the ball very well but I'm 4‑under and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Tell us about your play today.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   My play today wasn't very good, or at least it wasn't as good as the last three days.   Somehow I managed to keep a good score going.   I managed to miss on the right side of the fairways and the greens, and 4‑under is a decent tote.  
   
 Q.   Leading obviously in the clubhouse at the moment, you never know what might happen; what will you do now?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I think it's going to be very difficult to have a chance for a playoff, but I'll still hang around.   I think Mikko is playing well, but if he makes some mistakes, I'll be ready for the playoff.  
   
 Q.   Looks like you will secure a place in The Open Championship; how excited are you about that?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It's very exciting, after two years, starting with injury, starting with all sort of problems, I think it has not sunk in yet, but it is something that I was looking forward to go back to play the major, especially now that I'm hitting the ball probably the best I've ever hit.   So I'm really looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts on getting a qualification to The Open Championship?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I think it's great.   I think since the beginning of the year, I was very happy that they changed the qualification system.   I didn't really like playing 36 holes in a day in the middle of the events, and I think this is the best way to do it.   I'm glad I'm probably getting one of the spots.  
   
 Q.   Seems to reward players that are playing well in regular tournaments.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think at the end of the day, you're going to get better players, because it's over four rounds.   Most of them are European Tour players, good players, so I think it's a great change.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on Royal Liverpool and links golf?   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I played Royal Liverpool my last event as an amateur, so has a special place in my heart.   It would be very nice to play my first major after the surgeries of the last two years.  
   
 Q.   After an absence of time playing Hoylake, nice to go back and see the way that Tiger played it, all big crowds and things like that, wasn't it?   Seems a very enticing venue.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Absolutely.   I think it's one of the best venues.   Especially if the wind blows, it's going to be difficult.   As I said, I'm looking forward to go back to play major golf.
