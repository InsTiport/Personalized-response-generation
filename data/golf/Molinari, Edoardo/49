  Q. So you finished on 9, you still have to hope someone drops a shot but more realistically I suppose you're just going to come up short?   
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, probably it's not going to be good enough, so anyway, it's a good week. All in all I'm quite pleased. I think my putting let me down during the week in some points.   
 Today, as well, I missed a lot of chances. But I mean, still, it's early in the year and I'm playing quite well. All in all I'm happy.  
  
  Q. If you are getting into the Top-10 every second week or so, you are going to start accumulating --  
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Especially a tournament as big as it was a huge field, one of the best fields of the year, and to finish Top-5 in a week like this, it's great for your confidence and for The Race to Dubai, as well.   
  
  Q. Do you feel that you're nicely adjusted to The European Tour? Do you feel different this time around?  
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Definitely, I feel more prepared and I feel more experienced. And I think my game has been a lot better since the last time I played on Tour.   
 Obviously there's still some things that I want to improve and to change, but I'm on the right way, and hopefully I'll just keep getting better.   
  
  Q. America next for you, is it?   
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: It's the Match Play.   
  
  Q. That should be exciting?  
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Absolutely. And then hopefully I'll get in Doral, as well. I should be in the Top-50 after today, so I just need to stay there.   
  
  Q. Have you got the same schedule as Francesco?  
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: It depends. Because if I stay Top-50, I'll go Doral and then between Doral and the Masters, I think there's a couple of events in the States that I'm going to play at. I don't like to travel too much, but as I said, I need to stay Top-50. First of all, I need another good week at the Match Play and then we make plans.
