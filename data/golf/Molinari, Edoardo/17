  EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I think it was a great finish.   I hit the ball really well on the front nine today, and then just missed a couple of tee shots on 9 and 12 is paid a big price for them.   I holed some putts, and I'm five back, but on a course like this, if you get it going, you never know.   
   
 Q.   I take it you did know that there will be opportunities on the way home, as well, so you have to be patient?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, today it was only 300‑something to reach the green downwind on 17, so that was a big chance.   18 was a bit more difficult straight into the wind but you know, three birdies in the last three, I think it's a good finish.  
   
 Q.   And yet, modest in comparison to Stephen Gallacher?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, he was playing in front of us and then all of a sudden, every hole it was just one more, one more, one more.   Great playing to him and we'll see what he can do tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Does that spur you on when you're in the group behind?   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I was just taking care of my business.   I wasn't really paying attention to what he was doing.   I just had a number in mind which is double digits.   11‑under is pretty good and hopefully we can have a really good round tomorrow.   
I had a chance four years ago here, and it's a course that I really like and I think it suits my game a lot, so hopefully tomorrow I can play as well as I did today and maybe shoot a few shots less.
