Q. Great opening effort here in Morocco.  Is that a course you love?  Is that why we've seen these good performances?
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, definitely enjoy playing these courses where it's quite tight off the tee and you have to place your ball around the greens, and anything under par is a good score.  The wind is starting to pick up more, and even if the greens are soft, it's always a difficult course to play.
Q. What's been the secret to this return to form, because it has been a difficult past few tournaments for you?
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I haven't had a good start to the season.  I've had some good rounds but I've had some poor ones, as well.  Just working on the same things and being patient on the golf course and hopefully one day, this is going to end.
But one day, I'm very confident and positive the way I'm hitting the golf ball at the moment.  Today I hit a couple of loose shots, but I managed to get them up-and-down, and at the end of the day that's what you need to do.
Q. How do you like to play?  Do you like to play with an intensity, or are you able to relax, switch it off and let it happen?
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I'm quite relaxed to be honest.  I'm usually really, really good on Sunday afternoon, but I need to be there in the first place.
You know, the rest of the week is always very relaxed, and you just try and play the best you can, go through your process, go through your routine and just post good numbers.
