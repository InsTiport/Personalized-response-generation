  EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It was a good day.   I think in the afternoon, the greens were really firm.   I played a couple of practise rounds in the morning and in the afternoon it's definitely more difficult, especially the back nine was quite tricky, but I hit the ball really well today.   I missed a couple of putts but I'm hitting the ball really well.   
I've been hitting the ball very well lately, and especially off the tee.   The only blemish on the card was 18 today.   I just was between 3‑wood and I actually didn't commit to the shot.   But apart from that, I think I hit every fairway all day, and it was going like 320 every hole.   
   
 Q.   Nice eagle, as well.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I hit a great drive.   I was five yards from the green and then just a long chip shot, probably 35 yard chip shot.   
   
 Q.   When you tee off and you see Rory leading at 9‑under, and you're starting in the afternoon where it might be more difficult to score low, some regrets on your tee time?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   No, tomorrow I'll be able to play in the morning with softer greens, and I think that's going to be a big help tomorrow, because surely the greens will be firmer and firmer as the week goes by.   And I'm glad I'm playing in the morning tomorrow.
