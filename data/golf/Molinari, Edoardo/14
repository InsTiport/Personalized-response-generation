Q.   Talk about the changing conditions here. 
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Since this morning we knew it was going to be‑‑ most probably a start and stop day, so we only got one suspension, and yeah, we are happy with the game.   Probably could have done better the first round.   I'm trying to catch up which is not easy when everyone is making loads of birdies, but yeah, you know, happy where I am at the minute.

Q.   You are a joint leader at the moment but presumably there's that little doubt of whether you fall behind at the end of play. 
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think we'll be a few behind probably at 14‑under but hopefully it will be just a little bit closer than yesterday and then Thursday.   So unfortunately when you've shot 1‑under on a course like this, you have a lot of catch‑up to do, so I'll try to do it again tomorrow with another round in the 60 tees.
We saw today that 62s and 63s are out there on the course, so anything can happen. 

Q.   And it's like playing a different course, isn't it, with the weather conditions. 
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It was playing obviously a lot shorter but yesterday the greens were a bit trickier, a bit firmer.   Now it's longer and you've got longer clubs in.   But obviously it's like throwing darts at the greens.   It's slightly different conditions but still very scorable.
