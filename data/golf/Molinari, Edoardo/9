Q.   What did that mean, the birdie putt to close‑‑
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   A lot, to be honest, because unfortunately it was a photographer on the 18th tee snapped a couple of pictures.   I think he's got a nice shooting sequence.   But I really wanted to birdie the last two holes, worth a few quid and a few World Ranking points.   I think I deserved to finish top three this week the way I hit the ball.

Q.   Seemed like you got an lot of frustration out of the system with that?
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   I hit the ball very well today, again.   I had a lot of chances coming in, as well.   I mean, to be honest was the first time that I've been playing to win a tournament.   I finished second a couple of times but always coming from behind. 
To be tied for the lead with nine holes to go, it was a new feeling that I had not experienced in a while, and I'm still very happy the way I played.   I didn't putt very well on back nine but as I said, it's been three, four years almost.   So I'm very happy.

Q.   Superb to see and presumably having seen leaderboards, you were pumped up into that back nine, knowing that there would be chances there?
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think playing in front, I had a little bit of an advantage and I could put a little bit of pressure.   Unfortunately 3‑putted 11 from just off green and had chances from 12 to 15 and then make a bogey on 16.   But it was good to finish with a birdie at the last.

Q.   How are energy levels? 
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   The adrenaline helps you to keep going, and it's nice to have a week off now and go in America to see Sean.   Usually when I come back after seeing him, I play always a little bit better than when I arrive.   So I'm looking forward to Dunhill Links.
