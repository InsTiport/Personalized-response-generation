EDOARDO MOLINARI: Today it was very difficult this morning with a strong wind.  It was very cold.  But I managed to get off to a good start and hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  Made some very important putts.   
 Q.  A good start; that was a flying start with an eagle 2 at the first, wasn't it?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, I mean, it's a very short par 4.  You can lay up and I hit a great wedge in there from about 98 yards.   
 Q.  And is that the kind of start that makes you think, this is going to be my day?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Well, it's match play, so even if I made a birdie, that would have been enough.  I was only 1-up and still a long way to go.  But as I said, I hit the ball really good today, off the tee especially.  I was always in play and always putting pressure on him and that's what you have to do in match play.   
 Q.  Does that mean that you always felt control and that your destiny was always in your hands?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I would say so.  There were a couple holes where we were both putting from eight, ten feet and I managed to make those putts, and luckily for me he missed them and those were big turning points.   
 Q.  Are you relishing playing match play again and the fact that we have got a new event like this on the Tour?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: Absolutely.  I think it's a great change.  I mean, the turnout from the players is fantastic.  It's a great field this week.  It's probably one of the best fields of the year, and it's a lot of fun to play match play on a links course.   
 Q.  Do you fancy your chances, given your pedigree at this kind of format?  
EDOARDO MOLINARI: I'm decent in match play, so we'll see how the week progresses.
