 Q. Happy with the way it went today? 
 ANDERS HANSEN: Obviously think we are both pretty happy with that. I think we played pretty nice. We stuck to our plan, just plodded along and tried to give ourselves putts for birdies, and I think it worked out quite nicely.

 Q. Your reaction to today? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think it was the first time we played together but it was easy from the beginning and we are both consistent players. So we just have to use our strength and having more chances for birdies as possible. 

 Q. How did you feel that the partnership worked then? It's obviously a little bit more experience and sort of making your debut. 
 ANDERS HANSEN: It worked nicely. I did my things and he did his things and we didn't get in each other's way, just sort of tried to support each other as well as we could. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I think that was one of the keys, just to keep it simple and each one of us stick with our own game plan and you know, maybe when you are on the green, you can try and be a bit more aggressive with the putting, if you have two birdie chances. 
 So I think the key was that many times, we had both putts for birdies and you know, we could have good goes at them. 

 Q. What was the key out there, did you feel areas of your game which worked well? Was the putting the key? 
 ANDERS HANSEN: Absolutely. I putted really nicely today. So I think that was probably really key. The putting was really good. We played solid from tee-to-green and I putted really well. 

 Q. What about your first experience of this competition? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I enjoyed it a lot obviously for the result but the atmosphere was nice and it was a pretty good crowd. It was a pleasure playing with Anders, especially the way he played today.
