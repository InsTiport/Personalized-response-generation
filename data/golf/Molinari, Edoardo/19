 Q.   You've put yourself in a lovely position.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think I'm in a good position.   Today I played some really good golf.   Hit just one shot on 14 that ended up two or three feet short and made a doubleâ€‘bogey.   
But apart from there, I think I'm playing very well, and hitting the ball off the tee especially, fantastic, which you have to do around here.   And you know, there's been a few people in the years behind that won coming from behind, so I think I'm in really good position.   
   
 Q.   You've held yourself nicely on the board in the last two days in rubbish and now we have some gorgeous conditions; just take some chances?   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   Yeah, today it felt like the course was playing very easy compared to what we had yesterday afternoon, playing five, six clubs less into the holes, so it was definitely playing easier, but still it's quite dangerous out there and you have to play some good golf to post some good numbers.  
I was there last week with Sean again and we worked on hitting the ball down when it's windy and I think it's paying off, especially in the first two days I was able to hit some shots that I didn't have in the bag before, some low punch shots, that you need around here.  
   
 Q.   Show us the thumb.   
EDOARDO MOLINARI:   It's getting better compared to how it was a couple of months ago.   It's ten times better.
