 Q. Nice to get underway, but so close today, talk us through it. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's just a bit disappointing. You know, we didn't have a good start, but we managed to get back into the match in the last few holes and they made a great birdie on 17. And you know, it's really disappointing, because when it's so close, you know, it's hard to go away without even a half a point.

 Q. Looked like you were coming back nicely on the back nine. 
 EDOARDO MOLINARI: Yeah, I think we played great from the 11th on. We had a lot of chance for birdie and hit a lot of greens. The course is playing really difficult and it's really unfortunate we could not even get out half a point from this match because I think we deserved it the way we played on the back nine but there are two more matches to play and hopefully we can get some more points.
