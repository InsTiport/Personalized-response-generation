Q. Bernd, you sort of turned around a round today.  Disappointed to drop a shot at the last?
BERND RITTHAMMER: Yeah, we decided for a very defensive game plan off the tee on 9.  We only hit 2-iron and unfortunately I missed the fairway left.  I was left with a very long shot and I hit a 3-wood there and hit it into the right trap and made a bogey.  It is quite a tough hole today, because we thought dodging the bunkers is our main priority and we hit a 2-iron and I just didn't hit it too well.
All in all, obviously a roller coaster round but in general quite happy with where my game is.
Q. You must be quite happy to have turned it around at the turn.  You got a birdie right away.
BERND RITTHAMMER: Yeah, I had a rough patch from, I think like 15, 16, 17 but then also I know 16, 17, it's not easy holes.  That was my attitude, thinking, well, okay, you can drop a shot here.  Then I had a nice bounce back on 18 and then started feeling comfortable and then started hitting quality shots.
Yeah, I had a very nice birdie on 6, on the par 5 which is just ay very tough hole into the wind.  Yeah, pleased with that.
Q. 9-under overall, still a pretty positive-looking position going into tomorrow.
BERND RITTHAMMER: Yeah, I haven't looked at the scoring too much but it looks like Tyrrell is running away, but at the moment second spot seems in reach.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  It's my first time playing this event and it's absolutely brilliant.  Playing the Old Course is obviously going to be very special.
