Q. Tell me about finishing up plus 7, right now above the cut line.
GRANT BOOTH: It's going to be sort of an anxious wait all day.  Look it, it's a position I didn't think I was going to be in after my start yesterday, to be honest with you.  So to finish plus 7, pretty fair after the poor start yesterday.  Probably due to nerves and a little edgy.  So to get it going and come back and see everyone out here supporting and hear everybody Go Pack and that kind of thing, a lot of fun.  Definitely a couple of moments out there that Nick and I really enjoyed like yesterday with the hole out on 18 and today almost another one.  Awesome two days.  Hopefully I'm around tomorrow.  But it's been great so far.
Q. After 17, you're minus 7, you finished with 14 points the rest of the way.  What was it for you that was able to help you pull out of how you started?
GRANT BOOTH: Yeah, I probably just calmed down and started playing golf, I guess, because it got to the point where you're like, well, can't get any worse sort of thing.  So that stretch, to finish off the last couple of days, sort of proved to me that, all right, I can definitely compete out here.  That there is definitely a level of calmness and courage that you need to play out here for sure.
