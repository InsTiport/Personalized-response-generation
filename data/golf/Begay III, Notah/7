Q.  I guess you kind of gave one away there on the 9th hole.
NOTAH BEGAY:  Yeah, that's a tough hole, a little bit into the wind.  Guys are going to be hitting 2 irons and maybe even 3 wood into that hole.

Not bad, I played well.  I had a chance to shoot a real low round after being 5 under through 11 holes, but couldn't get anything going coming in.

Q.  What is it about this course that sets up well for your game?
NOTAH BEGAY:  I think just the drives.  I have a tendency to hit a lot of fairways normally, but it seems to really escalate here.  Some of the holes set up real well in terms of how my eye sees them, and for a golfer that's real big in being able to make a confident swing.

Q.  Finishing 3 under today, do you feel like you're in good position for tomorrow?
NOTAH BEGAY:  The golf course is playing pretty easy this morning with no wind and the greens being real soft.  I think it's just going to get me in a good spot to hopefully move up the leaderboard tomorrow and hopefully on the weekend.

Q.  Did that fog delay affect you at all?
NOTAH BEGAY:  No, I got to catch up with a lot of old friends, catch up on all my gossip with everybody.  If you need to know anything, I'll let you know (laughter).
