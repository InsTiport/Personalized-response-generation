Q. It took awhile to finish round one but are you pleased?
ROBERT STREB: Yeah, kind of hung in there yesterday, obviously, the stuff as we were finishing was awful.  Got up-and-down out of the bunker this morning, birdied 7.  So it was all right.  The wind today was pretty much nonexistent, just had to wait on the rain and the fog.
Q. How different was it today compared to yesterday, because it rained all night long?
ROBERT STREB: The greens were pretty soft yesterday, they were softer today.  There was already water standing on the practice green this morning.  So, if we get anymore rain, I think we're going to be sitting around for awhile.
Q. Did the fog have any affect?  Because there's some guys over on 18 that are just waiting to tee off because it's kind of hanging down in that little valley?
ROBERT STREB: Yeah, we waited on 9 for probably 10 minutes.  Kind of figured we weren't going to go back and warm-up, so we just hoped we hit it straight enough where they could find it and try to get done.
Q. Overall though, you've been out here a long time, this is what you almost expect out here, right?
ROBERT STREB: Yeah, unfortunately, I didn't play the last two years when it was sunny.  So this is kind of what I've gotten.  Usually you're going to get one bad day, it's rainy season.  You kind of hope you're over here in the trees.
Q. It could be a long day for you.  What's the plan now as you get ready for round 2?
ROBERT STREB: I think they backed them up another 30 minutes, so just going to try to go put my feet up for a minute, get a bite to eat and get going again.
