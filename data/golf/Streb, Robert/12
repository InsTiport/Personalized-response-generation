Q. Robert, word is we're going to be done for the day.  Obviously a long day for you, sitting around, hanging out.  What are your thoughts on the day and how do you prepare for tomorrow?
ROBERT STREB: Yeah, kind of a long day trying to figure out what to do.  Obviously the course looks like it is unplayable.  Everything is underwater, regardless of whether the lightning stopped.
I guess just go home, hang out with the family and might be waiting around tomorrow morning, too.
Q. Does it help at all that you didn't actually start today, or is that -- just knowing that only a couple groups ahead of you got just a hole or two?
ROBERT STREB: I don't know.  The wind was kicking up pretty good, so maybe it wasn't the worst thing.  I'm guessing we're going to be here till at least Monday, hopefully not Tuesday.  But we'll see how it goes and just kind of take today as a day of rest, I guess.
Q. You talked about yesterday, first time in this position.  How does your mind-set change with the delay?
ROBERT STREB: Try to keep it the same.  Still got to play 36 holes and start fresh tomorrow and see how many we get in.
