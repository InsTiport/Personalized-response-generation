  ROBERT STREB: That wind kind of turned a little bit to help us, and you feel like you should birdie in a hole, but it's a good little hole.  To get under par for the day was kind of a win for me.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ROBERT STREB: Yeah, you know, it was blowing left to right all the way out and right to left on the way in, but got really windy out on the end of the course, and it was moving your ball 40, 50 yards in the air, so I felt like I was doing pretty well to make some pars, had some two-putts and happy to be in the clubhouse.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ROBERT STREB: Yeah, I guess you never know what could happen.  We'll see how far in front those guys get.  But try to have a good weekend and see how we do.   Q.  What were your expectations coming in?  ROBERT STREB: I didn't really have much.  I didn't know what to expect or how I would play here, but being able to miss to the left is kind of a helpful thing for me, but it's been a lot of fun.
