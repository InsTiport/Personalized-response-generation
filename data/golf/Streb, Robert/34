Q. You came here to the Deutsche Bank Championship 96th in the FedExCup standings, and now you're 64th and moving on to the BMW Championships.  Some players like to know their position as they make their way on the back nine here.  Some don't.  When you came to the 18th tee, did you know your position and what you needed to do?ROBERT STREB: I did.  I tried not to watch.  I was waiting for my name to show up, my caddie wasn't real thrilled with me, he tried to stand in my way.  I knew where I stood.  I was trying to finish birdie/birdie.  And I had a pretty good shot on 18 and made the putt and it's working out pretty good.Q. I'm sure you as a kid looked at the long putt and dreamed about sinking this to mean something.  When you did that here what did that mean to you?ROBERT STREB: It was pretty exciting walking up there because I knew I needed to make it.  You try to make it when you have to.  Luckily it went in.Q. First time ever in the FedExCup playoffs for you.  And now you've advanced to the BMW Championship, the third leg here.  What does that give you as far as confidence as you move on?ROBERT STREB: It's pretty exciting.  I have no idea how well I have to play next week to go any farther.  It's nice.  I missed the cut the first week.  I was kind of sweating it out to see if I played this week.  And things worked out pretty well for me.Q. You came here as I mentioned 97th, did you have the flight booked to Denver, were you preparing to go there?ROBERT STREB: Yeah, but it was on Southwest.  I can use it as a credit later.
