Q. Take me through your round today.  It seemed like it was a very consistent day?
ROBERT STREB: It was good.  Kind of like yesterday, I left some birdie chances out there kind of in the middle of the round, 10 and 11 especially, but did okay.  I made a nice up-and-down on 9 and then made a few birdies there on the back nine and a couple pars coming in is good.
Q. Looking like a top-10 finish.  What's it like to have a great round on a Sunday of a Major and how will that provide momentum going into the rest of the year?
ROBERT STREB: It's nice.  Those guys winning are still a long way in front, but it was really nice, felt like I got better each Major throughout the year, so it was nice.  I look forward to playing a few more next year.
