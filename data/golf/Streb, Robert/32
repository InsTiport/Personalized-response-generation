Q.   Tell us about that tee shot here at 17.
ROBERT STREB:   What did we have?   I don't remember.   I ended up hitting an 8‑iron just like earlier.   Got the line just right, got in soft and had a nice little short look at it.

Q.   Yeah, it was a great birdie putt you hit there, but you were so solid in the playoff.   You hit a great drive at 18.   Did you feel any nerves?
ROBERT STREB:   I was pretty nervous over those short putts, but managed to work it out, and things went in my favor.

Q.   You played awfully well on the Back 9 to get in this position.   What does it feel like to be a winner now on the PGA TOUR?
ROBERT STREB:   It's pretty exciting.   I don't really have any emotions for it yet, but very thrilled.

Q.   And your wife came out and gave you the big hug.   That had to feel great. 
ROBERT STREB:   It's awesome.   That was great.   It's awesome.   Got a little one on the way, so very excited.

Q.   And you're going to Augusta.   Have you made plans yet?
ROBERT STREB:   No.   I might be there as often as I can be, though.

Q.   Robert, congratulations, way to go.   Great shot at 17. 
ROBERT STREB:   Thank you very much.

Q.   Congratulations, Robert.   With a very happy Robert Streb here with a win on the second playoff hole.   Take me through the victory there. 
ROBERT STREB:   Pretty nervous on those two putts there on the last hole, and then here just happened to put a good swing on it, pretty nervous over that one, too.   But got it going the right way downhill, and it worked out perfect.

Q.   What was it like to see that ball disappear in the cup?
ROBERT STREB:   Pretty exciting.   Kind of expected to make it from there, but you never know.

Q.   Considering the journey you've been on‑‑ you had a PGA TOUR card, went back on the Web.com Tour.   To get to this point, what does it mean?
ROBERT STREB:   It's pretty exciting.   Didn't know what I was going to do last year.   Kind of waited it out, and had a really good finish at the Zurich, and just kind of led to all this.   Worked out great.

Q.   And now you have a trip to Augusta on the horizon.   How do you think that's going to go?
ROBERT STREB:   I don't know.   I'm not too sure, but I'm very excited about it.

Q.   And lastly, how are you going to celebrate the win tonight?
ROBERT STREB:   Probably just hang out with the family.   That would be my guess.

Q.   Congratulations, Robert. 
ROBERT STREB:   All right.   Thank you.
