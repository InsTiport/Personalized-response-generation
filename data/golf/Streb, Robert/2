  Q. If we could just get some comments about your round today and how it went out there.
 ROBERT STREB:   It was a little weird playing by myself all day and not being the first out, but did okay.  I wish I could have a few back in the middle of the round there, 6 and 7 and then a couple putts that didn't go in on 9 and 10.  Kind of stalled things a little bit.  But other than that, it was pretty good.  I wish I could have made a few more birdies, tried to get a little closer for tomorrow, but at least got a little bit of a chance and see what we can do tomorrow.
 Q. When did you initially find out that Branden wouldn't be joining you today?
 ROBERT STREB:   I think when I was driving to the course.  I got a message, didn't really look at it, then I got here, opened it, and I was like, I wonder why I got another tee time, and I was like, odd deal.  Obviously very nice of him to think of it for everybody else, go get tested.  Probably sucks that he was playing so well and that happened, but yeah, hopefully he heals quickly and gets back to normal.
 Q. Do you remember the last time you played by yourself out on TOUR?
 ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, I think it was Sunday at Greenbrier in the fall.  I had played so bad on Saturday, I think we played in about two hours.  Yeah, usually when you're by yourself you're at the end of the wave and you get around in two and a half hours or whatever and off you go.
 Q. What's your mindset heading into tomorrow as you're sitting five or six points back?
 ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, just try to make as many birdies as I can and hopefully get close to Troy.
