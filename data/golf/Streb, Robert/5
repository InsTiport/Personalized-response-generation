Q. Second-place finish today.  What's the mindset going into tomorrow?
ROBERT STREB: I guess try and catch Troy.  Just try to make as many birdies as I can and see where we're at at the end of the day.
Q. What was kind of your mindset going into today, knowing you had to do well to be in at least the top five?
ROBERT STREB: I figured I had to make some birdies.  Obviously there wasn't much wind.  Trying to make some putts here and there.  I made a few, but missed a few.  Played all right, though.
Q. Do you think these mountain conditions are a little different than what you're used to typically, or any advantage, disadvantage to you?
ROBERT STREB: It's a lot of math for my caddie.  All the uphill, downhill, altitude.  It makes the putting a little bit -- you have to pay attention, the uphill, downhill break all that.  Obviously you have the influence of the big hill.  Maybe pay a little extra attention than normal.
Q. You talked a little bit about it, but coming early this morning and having that big break, coming back and playing another 18.  How do you adjust to something like that?
ROBERT STREB: I don't know.  Just, I mean, luckily I had a long enough break, I can go back to the hotel and put my feet up for a little bit.  But, yeah, waking up at 4:00 and getting done at dark is a long day.
Q. Going to get right to bed tonight or --
ROBERT STREB: Probably go get some Chipotle, Blaze pizza, something of that nature and go to bed.
