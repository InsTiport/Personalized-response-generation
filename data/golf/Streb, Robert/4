Q. A lot of things changed on that, what was it, par-5, is it 13?
ROBERT STREB: Yes.
Q. You hit a wonderful shot in there.  Just talk us through what that situation was.  Obviously trying to make that putt for five points?
ROBERT STREB: I was honestly just trying to make sure I got the 2, hopefully make the 5, and it got away from me.  I had a lot of trouble on those greens.  They've been resodded.
And obviously I didn't make the second putt.  And then the next hole I thought my putt was in the middle and it bounced out.  And unfortunately it's not uncommon around here.
Q. Tough stretch, too, with a lot of chances, but also opportunities to make some errors.  How do you feel now?  Are you disappointed, obviously, a little bit?
ROBERT STREB: A little frustrated.  Between the two par-5s and (indiscernible) back at 14 and getting nothing.  Gotta go play next week.  But it is what it is.
Q. You made improvement in the standings, which is a big thing to you, right?
ROBERT STREB: Yes, I don't know how far I went, but probably not far enough.
