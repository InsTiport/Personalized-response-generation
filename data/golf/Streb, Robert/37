 Q.   What's the pressure like this week for you?  
ROBERT STREB:   I was trying to put it to the side as much as I could.   You can't completely ignore it but just tried to play the best golf I could.   Didn't make enough putts.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about today, considering the situation --  
ROBERT STREB:   I did okay.   
I got off to a rough start.   Made a couple birdies on 10 and 12.   Figured I had a pretty decent chance with 14 left and actually got pretty lucky there, had a chance at 4 and two good looks on 17 and 18 and just missed it low and high.  
   
 Q.   How long was 17?  
ROBERT STREB:   15 feet, 12 feet.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit into 18?  
ROBERT STREB:   Hit a pitching wedge.   Had a flyer out of the rough.   Got it just right and had a good chance.  
   
 Q.   At least you got the backup.   Do you like the idea of the four weeks for the Web.com or just be Q-School situation?  
ROBERT STREB:   I don't know.   We'll see how it goes.   One time I went to Q-School I didn't do particularly well so I guess this way kind of get four chances at it instead of one, I guess.   About the same size field.   We'll see.
