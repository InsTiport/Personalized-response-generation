Q. Five birdies in your round today.  What went well for you?
ROBERT STREB:   I guess I hit it pretty well.  Hit a few putts, but I missed some short ones on No. 1 and No. 3.  I can't believe I missed No. 1 after hitting a really good one.  I felt like I hit it pretty well, gave myself some chances.  Hit a few good pitches here and there and kind of hung around.
Q. It looks like you got up-and-down five of five times.  That helps.
ROBERT STREB:   Yes.
Q. So was your short game working particularly well I'm guessing?
ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, I was chipping them pretty close for the most part, made a good par putt on 18, caught a gust of wind.  But yeah, for the most part it went really well other than putting on 1 and 3.
Q. After being so close last year, what kind of mindset did you bring into this week?
ROBERT STREB:   I haven't been playing very good, so just trying to play some good golf.  Just trying to get going the right way and see what happens at the end of the week.
Q. You've never missed the cut here at the Barracuda Championship, so I'm guessing you're a fan of --
ROBERT STREB:   I'm glad you didn't jinx me.  Yeah, I like it out here for whatever reason.  It has some similarities to Montreux, obviously a little flatter, different layout, but still a really nice place.
Q. I know it's early, but what do you need to do this weekend to get yourself in contention on Sunday?
ROBERT STREB:   Probably just get as many birdies as I can, make some putts.
