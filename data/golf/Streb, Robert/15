 Q.  Robert, match play, it's proven on any given day you can beat anyone.  A nice 3-2 win.  Where did you take control of the match?  
ROBERT STREB: Just felt like I did all right kind of from the get-go.  Didn't give him too much.  I felt like he had a couple of holes on the back, he didn't take them from me.  But it was -- I felt like I played pretty solid, nothing special.  Enough to get by, right.   
 Q.  This golf course, it's a great neutralizer, isn't it?  It's more of a strategic test.  Did you find it played into your hands more than Dustin's?  
ROBERT STREB: Maybe.  He hits it a long way.  Obviously those downwind par-5s, he can move it a long way down there.  It doesn't necessarily help the bombers all the time, much like Doral.  But it's a good test and the wind obviously makes it pretty tough.   
 Q.  What does it do for your confidence to beat a player of Dustin's caliber?  
ROBERT STREB: It was nice.  I haven't been playing very well lately.  It was nice to win one of those, but I've still got a few more to go.
