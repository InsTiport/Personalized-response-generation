Q.   Way to get it back there on those last three holes.   Just talk about your finish. 
ROBERT STREB:   It was nice.   I was kind of hacking it today.   Today was much more of a struggle, but the last three holes were a big help.

Q.   What was more of a struggle?   What was going on today?
ROBERT STREB:   Hit it sideways, a couple breaks that maybe weren't so great, and they add up kind of fast. 

Q.   Still in at 1â€‘under for today.   A year ago was that the same kind of round to get back, or do you think you're getting better at piecing these kinds of rounds together?
ROBERT STREB:   I think I'm getting a little bit better, working on my temper a little bit, so temperament has been a little bit better.   Obviously I'm not scrambling to keep my job at this point, but trying to work on my temperament and be a little more even keel.

Q.   Is that a little perspective that you've got your card locked up, you're good to go for a little while?
ROBERT STREB:   It helps.   You're not wound quite so tight.   It's a big help, makes everything a little bit easier if you don't get off to the best start.

Q.   Was the golf course any different today?
ROBERT STREB:   The wind is a little different, but just mainly me. 

Q.   Take us through those last three holes, your birdies. 
ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, I hit a pretty crappy pitch and putt the hole before on 6, and then hit a nice long putt on 7.   I had seen that putt a couple times in the past, so I had a pretty good idea what it was doing.   Then a couple good shots on 8, and then a good drive on 9, and 9 was playing very short.
