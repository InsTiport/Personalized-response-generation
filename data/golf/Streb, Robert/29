 Q.   You had a little time to wait, being the FedExCup leader, with the time off, did you enjoy that time off?   
ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, it was kind of school.   I feel like the end of the year, you need one of those breaks.   Put the clubs away for a few weeks and just kind of hung out with family and my wife and took it easy.   I guess you are kind of rejuvenated when you get back out here.  
   
 Q.   Good to get that break and kind of refreshed?   
ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, usually when you're tired, you're a little edgy, doesn't take much to send you over the edge and get angry over nothing.   So that break gets you refreshed and you get a bad bounce here and there, it's not the end of the world.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the round?   Pretty solid.   You've seen the golf course, and it was pretty gentle for what Kapalua can show you.   
ROBERT STREB:   Yeah, it was very gentle from what I heard.   A few little miscues here and there but the score ended up being pretty good and keep me around for at least a little while.  
   
 Q.   You would take four of them, wouldn't you?  
ROBERT STREB:   I would be all right with that.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the pairing today with Ben.   
ROBERT STREB:   It was a lot of fun playing with Ben, just easy.   Good friends with him and then our wives are good friends.   So it's just kind of easy.   It's a good person to play with and pretty relaxed.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on this golf course?   
ROBERT STREB:   It's big.   It was, yeah, like you said, pretty gentle today, not a whole lot of wind but it's fun and give it a one‑of‑a‑kind between the views and the style of the course.
