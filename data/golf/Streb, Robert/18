Q. Just thoughts on your week.  Good round today and momentum heading into next week.ROBERT STREB: A bit of a disaster on the front nine.  Got off to a decent start, and then I think I hit one fairway on the front, which wasn't very good. Tried to start over on the back and ended up playing well on the back. It was a good tournament.  Can't complain.Q. What about your game that feels like it's going in the right direction or needs a little bit of work heading into next week?ROBERT STREB: I had a lot of chip-ins.  That was nice.  Probably get my driver in a little bit better order.  I didn't hit very many fairways.  Try to get that going because I think that's pretty important next week from what I've heard.  So do that, and then hopefully the putter stays fairly warm.
