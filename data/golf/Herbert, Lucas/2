  Q. Wonderful round of golf, 65, 6-under par, 9-under total.  Does it look like it's one or two shy to you?
 LUCAS HERBERT:   Yeah, you have to think it's probably one or two shy.  The conditions are a little easy out there, so you have to think the guys back at 8 and 7 are going to give it a run and at least get past it, and obviously Aaron is playing pretty nicely and at 10-under.
 It's probably not going to win or get into a playoff, but it was a great week nonetheless.  I've struggled in the Rolex Series Events through my career so far, and to really post a result this week that I think I was capable of, gives me a lot of confidence going forward.
 Q. Led through 36 holes and suffered in the really brutal conditions yesterday, shot 79 and shot back to 22nd place, six shots behind, what was going through your mind out on the golf course when you got to 6-under through ten.  Did you have a target score?
 LUCAS HERBERT:   I was trying to get to 13.  I thought that was going to probably scare some guys that are out there.
 Yeah, obviously the scores haven't been ridiculously low this week.  We've seen a 9 and 8 early doors but other than that, we haven't seen guys take it low around here.  It is always hard to keep pushing on when you are playing really well through ten holes.  I felt like my swing left me a little towards the end and I was fighting a little bit, but to get in the house at 9-under, I'm really happy.
