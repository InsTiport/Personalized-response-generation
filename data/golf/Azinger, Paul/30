Q.  You want to talk about your round?
PAUL AZINGER:  I didn't hit it really good.  I played okay.  I didn't do that great.  I can do better.  I scored good.  Conditions were tough.

It's a lot harder course than it was before.  The greens are hard and the pins were hard today, too.  The wind makes the course hard.
Q.  Will it give you any more of an advantage?  Hopefully, the course won't get dried out as...
PAUL AZINGER:  It's always easier to go early on Friday because then the guys go in the afternoon, they have the full field to deal with a little bit but, you know, no good scores came out of the morning, either.  The pins were hard, the winds were blowing.  It's obviously hard.  It played hard.
Q.  I appreciate it.
