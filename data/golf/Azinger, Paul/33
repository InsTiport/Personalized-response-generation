Q.  Good day for you, 2-under par.  You're only four shots off the lead, but you're in third or fourth place.  Talk about your feelings going into the weekend?
PAUL AZINGER:  Well, you know, I feel okay.  I just could have done better today.  I drove it better but I made a couple of mistakes.

Not birdieing 9 was stupid, 6-iron to the green, and I caught a good lie on 5.  I had 7-iron in there, made a bogey, just barely in the rough.  I never missed the fairway by much all day, but, we'll see.  I didn't hit it quite as good with my irons today.  I'm going to hit a few balls after I'm done.  But all in all, I would say where the tournament started, pretty happy to be sitting where I am.  Just a lot of angst before the bell rang.
Q.  Your second shot on 9, was that kind of a nasty lie?
PAUL AZINGER:  Well, yeah, I hated the lie.  Completely hated the lie.  Actually the ball never bounced.  I thought maybe it was plugged in.  Plus I could not identify my ball.  I looked at it; I should not have been in that spot from the fairway.  I had a cleaner yardage, wanted to hit a 5, thought I could smoke a 6 and just didn't get it all.  I think it was plenty of club.  But, you know, that's a birdie hole.  I hit a good tee shot.

Just trying to play one shot at a time.  I don't want to get out of myself at all.
Q.  As far as the conditions, did it get windier as the day went on?
PAUL AZINGER:  No, it was beautiful today.  It was way, way easier today.  The pins are not that easy, though.  And the golf course, this particular wind makes the golf course quite a bit harder, every year it does, and it laid down quite a bit that's why the scores are going to be better in the end.  Had it been like yesterday, it was going to be a single-digit winner.
