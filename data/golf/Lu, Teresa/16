   TERESA LU: I feel pretty good the way I played today and everything just went really smooth. I'm really happy about it.  
  
  Q. What would you say your best shot of the day was?  
 TERESA LU: I would say on No. 18 because I missed my driver a little on the left and I had to punch a little 8-iron, and it turned out pretty good, three feet from the hole.   
  
  Q. How is your game this year? How do you feel?  
 TERESA LU: I feel like I'm improving a lot from my rookie year to now, and I can feel I'm really improving everything.  
  
  Q. When you look at the leaderboard and you see you're 5-under and then Lorena Ochoa is 4-under, what do you think about that? Does it give you more pressure at all?  
 TERESA LU: Not really today. I just tried to focus on every shot I hit because I just changed a little bit my swing on Monday, so I just really have to focus on my tempo, otherwise my ball is going to go everywhere. So I didn't look at the scoreboard and just played the way I play.  
  
  Q. You said you made a swing change with your tempo?  
 TERESA LU: Yeah, on my backswing. I had a really long backswing and I shortened the backswing a little bit.  
  
  Q. So you just did that Monday?  
 TERESA LU: Yeah, I've been working on that a long time, but I didn't really get it done.  
  
  Q. Do you feel comfortable right now with your swing?  
 TERESA LU: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So you're not really -- when you're out there you're not really thinking about what changes you've made?  
 TERESA LU: Not really because I have to focus on my tempo since I couldn't do anything on the golf course.
