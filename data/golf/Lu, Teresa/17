   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How did it feel, your 6-under 66. 
 TERESA LU:  It feels very good right now because it's kind of my lowest round, so very excited about it. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And how did the course play out there with the rain in the morning?  The wet conditions, was it different today than the last couple of days. 
 TERESA LU:  Pretty much the same.  The fairways are pretty wet and the greens are holding pretty good because it's wet.  The green speed is pretty good. 

 Q.  This morning, was it easier as a result of the rain, being softer? 
 TERESA LU:  Yeah, it's softer and you pretty much hit the shot on the number, so you don't need to worry too much. 

 Q.  Is it a relief for to you get 18 holes in, whereas probably more than half the field will have to play up to 36 holes tomorrow? 
 TERESA LU:  Yeah, that is a good advantage.  I finished today and I can sleep in tomorrow, which is good. 

 Q.  What did you do today when play was delayed hour after hour, what did you do in the meantime?  Was that frustrating? 
 TERESA LU:  No.  We just hang out with friends and chitchat, having fun, had a good time. 

 Q.  And I think I read where you've missed maybe four of your last five cuts, and so what's the difference this week and today? 
 TERESA LU:  Well, I kind of tried to find a caddie for me, find a better caddie.  And this week I have a very good caddie.  He caddied for Hale Irwin, so he's really helpful. 
 The last couple of weeks, I kind of worked on something, my mental part.  So this week, it's getting better. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And what is your caddie's name? 
 TERESA LU:  Kenny Harms. 

 Q.  Was there anything specifically about your game today that was working, just off the tee or on the greens? 
 TERESA LU:  Pretty much everything.  My irons were pretty good today.  I had so many birdie putts and I missed a couple, made a couple. 

 Q.  Did you feel better today than you had in a while? 
 TERESA LU:  Yeah, yeah. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Let's go over your birdies and bogeys.  You started on the back nine and birdied hole ten.  What did you use and how far were you? 
 TERESA LU:  I hit an 8-iron like 135. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  To how close? 
 TERESA LU:  About ten feet. 
 14, I put it pretty close with a wedge, about six feet, from about 80. 
 16, 3-putt. 
 1, I had 90 yards to the hole, I used pitching wedge. 
 4, I used 8-iron or 9-iron from 130 to six feet. 
 5, 9-iron and put it like four feet from 125. 
 6, 5-iron to 15 feet from 171. 
 12, 8-iron and from 135. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thank you very much and good luck for the rest of the week.
