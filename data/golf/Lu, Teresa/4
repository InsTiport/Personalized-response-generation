Q. Great round.  Really good start.  What was working well for you today?
TERESA LU: I think everything was work out pretty good to me.  And the shot I want to hit, it was good, and especially the putting.
Q. Putting was good?
TERESA LU: I make a lot of birdie putts.
Q. Did you run into any trouble out there on any holes?
TERESA LU: Yeah, I did.  Two bunkers, make bogey from that.  But it was good bogey.
Q. You've played really well in this tournament before.
TERESA LU: Yeah, yeah.  Two, three years ago.
Q. What do you think you like about this style of play?
TERESA LU: Actually, I really feel it's difficult to the links course, but probably brings me more focus on it.  Yeah, and I think it's just luck that I play good here.
Q. This is your first time playing in an LPGA event in a couple of years since the last time?  When was the last time?
TERESA LU: This year.  U. S. Open.
Q. Did that give you a lot of confidence?
TERESA LU: Yeah, sure.  Sure.  With the difficult, tough course like that, it was good.
Q. What do you think about how you feel about your game as a whole?  How did you feel coming into this week?
TERESA LU: I've been playing in Japan for eight years, and it feels different, the course setting is different from Japan.  And you always learn something over here, the conditions and then the weather.  Yeah, it's totally different.
Q. What's the biggest difference do you think?
TERESA LU: I would say the links course, of course.  And all the great players over here.  So that brings a lot of pressure.  And motivation.
Q. What's your goal for the week?
TERESA LU: I don't know.  Just go out there, have fun as much as I can.
