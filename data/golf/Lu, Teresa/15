   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Your first birdie on the first hole. How did you do? 
 TERESA LU: I have 118 yards to the hole, and I have pitching wedge. I put it like three feet in front of the hole.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. Birdie on 6.
 TERESA LU: Birdie on 6. Yeah, that one I have a 5-iron with 163 yards and put five feet, five feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay, birdie on 8.
 TERESA LU: 8-iron, and I think this was five feet from the hole.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far was that shot? 
 TERESA LU: 136.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. Bogey on 11. 
 TERESA LU: That one, I mishit my 9-iron, mishit it right, and then chip it. Missed the putt. Chip it pretty good and missed the putt.

 Q. How far was the first putt?
 TERESA LU: Like four feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And then you 2-putt? 
 TERESA LU: Right.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And the birdie on 12.
 TERESA LU: 9-iron on that one. That was 127.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: To how close? 
 TERESA LU: Six feet, seven feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Were those your only birdies and bogeys of the day? 
 TERESA LU: Uh-huh, yeah. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. You've put together two great rounds out there: 67 and 69. You're in second place in the clubhouse going into the weekend. 
 Can you just talk about how you've been playing and what's going right for you this weekend. 
 TERESA LU: I think this tournament I tried to be really focus on my shot and my routine, especially my tempo. I tried to shorten down my backswing, and I have to really focus on my tempo to make a ball go straight. So that's most different thing.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: We were talking as we came in, and you and Yani are roommates or housemates here. You have the same U.S. host. You're both playing great golf this weekend, and all year. Have you been learning something new in the past couple of months, to what's going on there?
 TERESA LU: I think I always learn something with playing with other different people. I feel like when I go out there and I watch the scoreboard, if she's making birdie I got to do something. That makes me keep going. So I think that's really good.

 Q. What are you doing to work your tempo? What kinds of drills? How do you improve your tempo? 
 TERESA LU: Yeah, like I will count it one, two, three, to make it every time repeating. 

 Q. You do that on the golf course or just in practice?
 TERESA LU: On the golf course.

 Q. So that is your only swing practice then?
 TERESA LU: Right. And I will work on my swing on the driving range.
