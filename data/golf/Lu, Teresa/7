  COLIN CALLANDER:  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have Teresa Lu with us who shot a 69 for an 8‑under par total of 208, currently tied for the lead in the championship. 
Well done. You must be very pleased with the way you've been playing so far. 
TERESA LU: Yes, yes, I do. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  You told me a few minutes ago you have not played in this championship for five years. So are you slightly surprised about how well you've done the last few days? 
TERESA LU:  Yes, I didn't expect to play this well the first place. I just tried to play my game and hit the low shots. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  You said you didn't expect that you would play so well.
TERESA LU:  I didn't expect this good score. I think I just focused on my low shot, my swing and it turned out pretty good. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  So have you actually been playing different shots what would you have done in normal conditions? 
TERESA LU:  Yes, a lot of lower shots today. That's not usually what we play over in Asia. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  And when did you learn how to play those shots? Did you learn in the past British Opens? 
TERESA LU:  Yes, my coach just told me how to hit low shots the week before the U.S. Open in case I need it. And, yes, I did. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  And do you enjoy playing links golf? 
TERESA LU:  Yes, it's a really fun course, especially the wind just came up different way every day, and the golf course just played totally different. It was fun. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  How many British Opens have you played before? 
TERESA LU:  I'm not sure. Four times, five. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  I'll open it up to questions. 

Q. I know you've won on the LPGA and you've had several worldwide wins. How do you treat major championships differently than any other events? Do you treat them any differently in preparation or during the week? Are they any different for you? 
TERESA LU:  I don't feel exciting to come over to the major but I just try to stay like the same as usual and just don't over excite it‑‑ try to be calm over it. 

Q. Do you have any experience of going out in the final round of a major and how do you think you'll deal with it tomorrow? 
TERESA LU:  I think this is my first time and I think tomorrow I have to try to stay relaxed over it because it's going to be a tough day tomorrow and I think I just need to play my game. 

Q. Is that a position you would rather be in is being up in front with such a close pack behind you, or would you rather be the chaser? Do you have success being out with the lead?
TERESA LU:  It's always good, yeah. But it's going to be a good experience for me. 

Q. Can you tell us how many worldwide wins do you have professionally?
TERESA LU:  I can't remember. Not a lot but I can't remember (giggling). 
COLIN CALLANDER:  Which tours have you won on? 
TERESA LU:  Japan. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  All your wins on the JLPGA? 
TERESA LU:  Yes and Mizuno. 

Q. When was your last win? Was it Mizuno? 
TERESA LU:  It was June this year. 

Q. Last month? 
TERESA LU:  This month‑‑ I mean, this year. 
COLIN CALLANDER: June this year? 
TERESA LU:  Or May. Something like that. 

Q. If you were to win tomorrow, would you celebrate with champagne or perhaps a little glass of whisky? 
TERESA LU:  Sure. Champagne.
COLIN CALLANDER: When your coach at the U.S. Open taught you to play low shots, was it something you found easy to do.
TERESA LU:  No, not easy. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  But you seem to have managed to do it very, very quickly. You haven't played much golf over here. 
TERESA LU:  Yes, but I think I got lucky out there. Stayed out of the bunkers which is lucky.
