 Q.  Were you aware of what Candie did earlier today?  
TERESA LU: Did I know?   
 Q.  Did you know that she got the first two points?  
TERESA LU: Well, I didn't know the whole process, but I just knew she won a point.   
 Q.  Overall experience today in singles play, how did it compare playing by yourself as opposed to with teammates?  
TERESA LU: Well, at first I was really nervous because last three days I was just playing team play and I could rely on my teammate and we were more relaxed, but today is kind of a little bit nervous over the tee shots.  But I think I played the best day of this week.   
 Q.  When did it start to calm down for you and you started to get on a roll?  
TERESA LU: Well, I would say probably the third hole because I made a chip-in birdie on the first hole, and obviously it's pretty lucky, and then on the second hole she got par to win over my bogey, and the third hole I made a birdie, so that means my game is there, so I just need to calm down.   
 Q.  So your experience overall so far at UL International Crown?  How much fun is it?  
TERESA LU: I mean, it's so different than other tournaments, and I would say this is the most fun tournament I've ever played.  The music on the first hole, it was just unbelievable.  It's fun.
