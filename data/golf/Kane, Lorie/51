 Q.  Can you talk about your round a little?
LORIE KANE:  I feel that I left several shots out there.  I'm glad to get a low round in there because I haven't done that in a while.

Q.  Did you pay attention to what Annika was doing today?
LORIE KANE:  A little bit.  I'm excited for Annika.  It's great for herself and great for the LPGA Tour.  The attention and media coverage we've gotten from this as a Tour is great.

Q.  What's your reaction to the negative comments that have come from LPGA players?
LORIE KANE:  I'm not aware of any out there, and there shouldn't be any.  This is about an elite athlete testing herself, and I think it's great.
