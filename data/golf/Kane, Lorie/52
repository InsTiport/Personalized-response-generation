LORIE KANE:  Bogey on 1, three putts.  Birdie on the fifth, chipped in, no putts.  6-iron to the front edge.
Birdied 9.  I had a wedge and I only had 105 to the pin, hit it maybe three feet.
Birdied 14 -- Danny had the wrong number.  He added instead of subtracted.  He called me off the shot.  Changed it and I hit it to two feet.  So it was a 7-iron, and we had 138 to the pin.  He said it was 148, so I had a 6-iron in my hand.  He is a good caddie.  It was just a mistake.  My preshot routine is he lines me up, and I was in there and very comfortable and ready to go and he wasn't moving anymore.  And he said "Hang on."  His feet were, I'm thinking -- I thought I was way out of line, and there were some planes going over so it was difficult to hear.  He'll be really mad at me if that makes print, and I hope it does.
15, hit my 4-wood, we had about 205 to the front and hit it to approximately 15, 20 feet, and just tapped in the birdie.
And that's about it.  I did make a very good 3 on 17.  Did not hit a very good 5-iron and I got very lucky that I was on the fringe of the hazard, not in the hazard, just outside and got up and down both on 17 and 18.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   Particularly where I was.  I was very fortunate, I made a bad bad swing at the wrong time on the wrong hole, but I got a break and was able to get up and down from there.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   Well, I think you have to take all of the positives, and that was definitely -- I was thinking just that.  Here is one of the breaks I needed, and instead of making a big number, I walked away with par.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I hit a 5-iron.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I enjoyed the experience last year.  I mean, it was tough.  It's still tough.  I think that with the fairways not -- I guess they didn't overseed and the bermuda is long, but it's lying down, and the fairways are very, very tight, so that's making every shot, particularly fairway woods, really difficult. 
Last year, without the wind it was still a tough layout.  You have to place your shot.  You have to be on the right side of the green.  Today I felt that the greens were very grainy and slower.  I don't know if that had anything to do with -- the wind might have dried them out.  They were a little moist yesterday, and the sun came out, and bermuda grows faster.  It's the last tournament of the year.  I think being involved with Mr. Trump is good for the LPGA Tour.  It puts us out there and what he can do for us is great, and for him to invite us here is very nice.  Plus the BMW, I'm loving that.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I would love to play with Annika.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I do absolutely.  She just had a phenomenal year and I really don't think she's gotten all the dues she should have.  She impresses the hell out of me every day.  She just has the ability to be the best and she is.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I think there is a major issue that's been on the plate and that's Augusta.  That's really unfortunate.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I think it's a combination of things, her mind, her ability to set goals and achieve goals and challenge herself.  Her work out regime is bar none the best, and I think that's helped her game.  Watching her driving stats, she's got it all.  She's not afraid to challenge herself, and I think that's probably the biggest reason that she is where she is every week.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I want to say that she's probably the most consistent ball striker.  She's hitting it in the middle of the club face every time, plus she's hitting her driver far and leaving herself with some short irons into some difficult greens.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:  I think I can be that good, Doug, but my personality and the way that I am, I don't know if it would allow me.  I know I've worked hard myself.  I know I can work harder.  It's just a different -- that's why we're two different people.  There has to be a way that I can get there and I'm going to take the off season to just keep working harder.  I think for myself, I need to get in better shape again.  Take a jump there and work hard on my short game and my wedges.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   Speaking for myself only, I feel that that's all I have right now, is golf, and that's all I do.  You would have to ask me that question in a couple of weeks.  I'm toying with that.  What is it going to take to be No. 1 and would I be committed to giving up -- I don't know that it's even fair to say giving up anything.  I don't know.  That's a very good question.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   But I think, you know, if I can -- Annika has a life.  Annika has other things outside of golf.  Annika enjoys herself.  She loves what she does.  And when she goes home, she's in her home.  She and David have a great time.  But when it's time to work, she works.  That's the part that -- again, I respect her.  I have a huge amount of respect for her, but I'm going to challenge myself and find my way to do it.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I have no idea what that --

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   Well Se Ri does the same thing and everybody has a different kind of approach to their preshot waggle.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:  I think she was in the field the majority of the time.  Well, I know one, two -- Hawaii, Columbus, St. Louis, Mizuno, three of my four wins she was in the field.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   Absolutely.  You want to play the best.  I'm sure she's waiting outside, so I'm going to say, "Are you done with me?" 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
LORIE KANE:   I don't have an answer for you, Doug.
