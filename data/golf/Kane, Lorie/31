Q.
Lorie, you were blowing kisses to the crowd.  Have you ever personally been received any warmer than you were in London this week?
LORIE KANE:   Well, I would have to think long and hard as to where.  But no, the fans were awesome.  There was a big group of people following us, but I know they followed some other great play today.  And it's not over yet, so hopefully it will be a show right down to the finish.
Q.  I think what you're telling me, you would come back here in a heartbeat if it ever came back to the Hunt Club.
LORIE KANE:  Well, I think it should come back to the Hunt Club.  The golf course sets up very well for us as LPGA players and I guess I would have to commend the superintendent and his staff, as well as our staff and field staff and the RCGA for setting up a very challenging Open championship.
Q.  What can you say about your playing partner's round?
LORIE KANE:  Well, I figured Cristie would have had that in her yesterday.  I'll tell you what really impresses me about Cristie is she can pull it out of her hat when she needs to.  She is a very determined young lady and has a great golf game.  Had I gotten a couple of breaks to go my way early, I think I would have been able to feed off that.  Unfortunately it just wasn't my day.

But like I said to John, there's too many things going good for me to be thinking about anything that's not going good.  It was fun.  It was a challenge.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself here.  I don't know what's going to come down the stretch, but Cristie had it all today.
Q.  Lorie, that lie in the bunker on that first hole, have you ever seen a bunker lie like that before?
LORIE KANE:  Well, I have.  (End of audio.)
