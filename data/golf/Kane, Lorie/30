LORIE KANE:  What to say about Patty Berg?  Fist of all, I think at 88 she lived a wonderful life and gave an unbelievable amount of her time to golf.  She's one of the reasons for the LPGA persevering through the very lean times.  I know that even as early as this year she did a clinic at the U.S. Open, and I haven't played in a lot of U.S. Opens but I remember watching her first clinic that I saw in Mesa, how she handled herself, and she'll be greatly missed.
