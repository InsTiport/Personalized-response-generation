  Q.  (Inaudible)?

LORIE KANE: Oh, absolutely.  There is not a better feeling in the world than playing in front of Canadian fans, and I know that everyone was pulling for me out there.  If I can say one thing:  I apologize to those spectators who saw me break my putter on the way to the 18th.  That's something that I don't think is very     was a very wise thing for me to do.  That really wasn't the true LORIE.  That was the very frustrated golfer that shouldn't have done that.  I apologize especially to the kids that probably were watching.
