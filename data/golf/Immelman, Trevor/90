JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Good day for you.  31 today.
TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah, thanks.  Played decent yesterday but putted really badly.  I really focussed on trying to maybe role a few in today.  So that was nice to hole a few putts and get some momentum.
Q.  Talk about your putt at 18.
TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah.  Really quick down there.  You know, any time you hit that green from the tee you're pretty happy.  So, you know, to have that putt was obviously quite a tough one down that slope.  Managed to just start it on line and it was nice to see that go in.
Q.  Is that almost an unexpected bonus when you make a birdie there, because a par is pretty good to walk away with?
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Yeah, absolutely.  I managed to make three 2s today.  Any time you do that definitely helps your card.  But, yeah, to make one there is, you know, you really feel like your gaining a shot.
Q.  And as a guy that pretty much likes a lot of classic golf courses, talk about that.
TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah.  I mean, I've loved it every since the moment I got here.  I think it takes a bit of local knowledge.  I think if you've played here it definitely could help on these greens.  Every hole is a good hole.  I love it.  It's a lot of fun to play.
Q.  Okay.  And then I guess last question.  Had pretty much ad ream rookie season winning almost $4 million.  What would winning a tournament    a long way to go    but what would winning a tournament like this do for your year?
TREVOR IMMELMAN:  As you say, long way to go.  But it would be great.  Any time you win on the PGA TOUR it's a fantastic achievement.
