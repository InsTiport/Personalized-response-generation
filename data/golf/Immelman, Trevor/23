 Q. Overall thoughts on the course, playing pretty fair all in all?
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, I mean, you know, they moved some tees up, so things were a little shorter. The ball was running a bit more on the fairway. 
 So if you hit it straight, you could run down there. So the course is great. It's a tough golf course. You know, especially these par 3s, you've got to suck it up and hit four good ones on the par 3s.

 Q. You're pretty much playing in the teeth of the humidity this afternoon; morning time tomorrow, is that going to be a big help for you?
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Oh, this is something compared to what I've been practicing in this Florida. I mean, this is a breeze. I can wear a sweater out there; this is nothing. That doesn't bother me whatsoever. Hopefully shoot a good score.
