 (Applause.)  
 CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE: Zach, if you would do us the great honor of placing the green jacket on our new champion, Mr. Trevor Immelman.   
 (Applause.)  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Thank you. Wow, I'm at a serious loss for words here. But first of all, to Mr. Payne, thank you so much for hosting us this week. You know, I've kept saying all week long in the media center that anytime you come here to Augusta National, it's just an absolute thrill. You know, for all of us competing here this week, it was no different. It just was a fantastic week. So thank you so much.   
 To everybody who helped prepare the golf course, looked after us in the locker rooms, all the volunteers, the hundreds of staff that go behind running such an incredible event, thank you so much for doing this for us because this truly is something special for us to come and play here every year.   
 To Zach, congratulations on being such a fine champion. I've been looking up to you, I must say at times feeling a little jealous the whole of last year. But you're a fantastic man and an incredible ambassador.   
 (Applause.)  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Obviously to all the fans that came out here to root for us today, all the South Africans, I saw and heard a lot of you out there, thank you so much for getting behind me and trying to push me through. I really appreciate that.   
 Lastly, to my family that are sitting here, my wife Carmenita, Jacob who's somewhere in the crowd, my little boy, my brother Mark, my mom June, my father Johan and my sister-in-law Tracy, thanks so much for being here, thanks so much for just making so many sacrifices for me to get to this point. I'll never forget what you guys have done for me, and I really do appreciate it. As much as it is for me, it's for you, as well, so thank you so much, guys.   
 (Applause.)  
 CHAIRMAN BILLY PAYNE: Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I would like to thank everyone for their tireless efforts and support in making the 2008 Masters a success, and we look forward to seeing you all again at the 2009 Masters. Thank you very much.
