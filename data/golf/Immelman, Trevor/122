TREVOR IMMELMAN:  I am a little disappointed. A 72 is a pretty good score in those conditions but I am disappointed by missing a four footer at the 17th and making bogey up the last. I really felt that if I had holed the one on 17 and made par at the last I might have stolen one on the field there. It was damage limitation and I am still in with a chance. It was extremely difficult. I didn't seem to find my swing out there. I was hitting everything right. I know what the problem is but I was struggling to fix it in the windy conditions.

The greens have really got brown and dried out. The 18th is really dry and hard. I think we got a little unlucky with this side of the draw but, all in all, I am pleased to have a good chance over the weekend. You've got to be on the fairway and I didn't do that today. If you are hitting out of the rough it's difficult to get the spin.
