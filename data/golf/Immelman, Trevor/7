 Q.  You must have enjoyed that?  
TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, it's nice it play well for a change.  It's been a little while.  Last two weeks, I've had one good round, one bad round, missed the cut.   
After a solid round yesterday, I was hoping that I could find a way to keep it going, and pretty solid on the front nine and then made a few birdies to finish, which is real nice, satisfying feeling, I must say.   
 Q.  From that round yesterday, was there very much momentum going into today?  
TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, you know, funny, obviously I've had no results, but my game has started to feel a little bit better in the last month or two.  I was just trying to find a way to bring it to the golf course consistently and bring it to the tournament.   
So yeah, really thrilled to go out there and hit solid shots today.   
 Q.  What do you feel you found?  
TREVOR IMMELMAN: It's way too complicated for me to explain to you, but you know, if I can keep it for two more days, maybe I'll tell you (laughing).   
 Q.  Wonderful way to finish.  
TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, real nice.  Decided to lay up on 17 with an iron off the tee and hit a beautiful wedge to a few feet there and made the birdie.  I was trying to go for a big drive on 18 and just pulled it.  Kind of scuttled it down the fairway, and once again, from about 120 yards, hit a nice shot in to about eight feet and made it.   
It's nice to see some putts go in.  I think that's kind of what held me back last week.  So, yeah, hopefully I can keep it going.  Be nice.
