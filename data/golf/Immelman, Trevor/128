 Q.
Bogey-free round today.  Talk about the state of your game right now.  
 
TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Well, I played great last week.  This week I was determined to putt a little better.  Today I really putted the best that I've putted all year and I had a bogey-free round so I'm happy.


Q.  Talk about your birdies on 10 and 11. 

TREVOR IMMELMAN:  I played real solid the front nine and the course played tough today.  The greens were -- conditions were perfect. 

10, I hit a great wedge shot to three feet and converted that. 

And then 11, I hit it to six feet and converted that.  11 was a sand wedge and 10 was a wedge.


Q.  And then 18, you're in the rough on the left, but you still managed to --

TREVOR IMMELMAN:  I thought I hit a perfect tee shot and I was trying to slide it into the fairway and it just clipped a tree and kicked down, but I was very fortunate to get a real good lie and I managed to be able to put some hook spin on it in the rough and a pretty good up-and-down at the end.


Q.  Encouraged about the end of the season?

TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah, absolutely.  I had a fantastic start to the season in Europe and down in South Africa and kind of fell asleep a little bit in the middle part of the green, but I think my game is coming back so I'm looking forward to it.
