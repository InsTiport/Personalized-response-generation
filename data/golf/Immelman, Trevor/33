 Q. Solid opening effort of 69. You must be pleased. 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, I am. You know, it was a tough day out there. It's obviously calming down a little bit now, but obviously pretty blustery conditions for the afternoon group today. I'm proud of myself that I hung in there well and made some good putts, and I'm really thrilled with my round.

 Q. Two years since your victory, but there's been a lot of injuries since then. What do you attribute this form to? Are you inspired here at Augusta?
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, there's no doubt about it. I think everybody is inspired when they walk onto these grounds. But I attribute it to just a lot of hard work. Once I made the decision to have the surgery in October, you know, couldn't touch a club for three months, and the rehab was seriously intense. I started hitting balls around the first week of February, and it's just been a lot of hard growth. 
 You know, I felt like I was getting close, but still not close enough. You know, the practice rounds here I started hitting some shots that felt real good, and nice to do the same today.

 Q. For those who follow you on Twitter, we're very much aware of a trainer coming around regularly, so you're putting in that hard work and it paid off. Well done, and the best of luck for the remainder of the tournament. 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Thanks, I really appreciate it.
