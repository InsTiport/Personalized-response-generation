   TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Well, first of all, I hate losing, I know that much.  It's not a good feeling.  I'm proud of myself.  I went out there and I felt like I hit the ball real well.  Henrik got such a great start, and he put me under a lot of pressure there and I was a couple down early. 
 You know, I was trying to claw my way back and I felt like I hit some good shots, but he just kept making birdies at the right time. 
 You know, then I hit it a little too hard there on 15, my second shot.  I really thought I hit a great shot there, and that ball went over the back and it was near impossible getting that up-and-down. 
 You know, like I said, I really hate losing, but I'm proud of the way I played. 

 Q.  Did you learn anything about yourself this week, coming this far, an event like this, match play every single day? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  You know, it affirmed that I love match play.  I really enjoy the format of golf.  I enjoy the head-to-head competition.  You know, and I came into this week off a pretty poor finish last week and a pretty poor last month or so, you know, and I kept grinding it out and put the hard work in and ended up having a good week.  Like I said, I'm proud of myself for that.
