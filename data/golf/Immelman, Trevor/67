 Q.  It was obviously great to get through. 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah, we played some good golf today.  I was 5-under after 9 and only 1-up.  You know, then I got it to 2-up, and then he made another birdie to 1-up, so it was a really close match. 
 And then I was 2-up with three to play, and he made an unbelievable birdie on 16.  The pin is cut really tight there close to the desert, and he made a great 2 there. 
 Wound up playing 17, and he made another birdie there.  So all square playing the last.  Hit a good drive and a sand wedge to about ten feet and holed the putt.  I was really happy to finish like that.  I felt like I was in control of the match all day, but all of a sudden you stand on 18 and you're all square.  It was nice for me to come through in the end. 

 Q.  That's the beauty of match play, isn't it; you can be in control all the way and then you think, hey, wait a minute -- 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Well, he wasn't playing badly, he was playing solidly, but I just made a couple extra birdies and I was feeling good about my game.  But then he threw those two there at the end, so it made it really interesting. 

 Q.  He's a tough competitor because -- 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  He's experienced. 

 Q.  And he's a sparky character, as well? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Absolutely.  He's vastly experienced, and there's no substitute for winning, and the guy has won almost 30 times on the Japanese Tour, so he knows how to get the job done.  I always knew it was going to be a tough game today. 

 Q.  I think now it's Henrik, the defending champion? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Really.  I lost to him last year in the semifinals.  This golf course suits him and suits his game.  I'm going to have to go out there and play some great golf, and hopefully it'll be good enough. 

 Q.  A touch of revenge? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Hopefully.  I'm always trying my best.
