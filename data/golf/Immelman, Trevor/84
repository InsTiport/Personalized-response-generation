   TREVOR IMMELMAN:  The thing that happened today that hasn't been happening over the last three or four months is I holed some putts. 
 You know, it's all very well and good hitting good shots, but if you don't hole a putt it doesn't mean anything.  That was nice for me today to convert those opportunities. 

 Q.  You played very nicely over the first two days.  Yesterday you said your swing was sort of blown off track by the wind.  What was it you found on the range? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Well, just an old swing thought.  You know, I've got a few that I kind of mess around with.  If it works a little while longer I might let you in on it. 

 Q.  Obviously to hole putts on these greens you've got to read them.  They're very tricky, aren't they? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah, it really is a great surface.  If you start the ball on-line it's got a pretty good chance of going in.  It's not like playing on poa annua where you can hit a good putt and it still can bounce off-line. 
 The surface is really, really smooth.  But I sure did read them a lot better today than I have been the past few days. 

 Q.  Fancy your chances over the rest of the week? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Well, if I play like I did this morning I think I've got a good chance.  You know, I've been a little bit hot and cold this week.  I need to find some consistency.
