TREVOR IMMELMAN: I played really well today actually. The greens were pretty average and the ball was bouncing around a lot. It was quite disappointing. I felt I hit a lot of good shots and putts just nothing went my way. Little disappointed with one under. The greens were pretty bouncy so that made it tough for us out there. Nothing wanted to stay on line.

Yesterday, just relaxed, hung around the hotel, worked out and caught up on some sleep.
