   STEVE ETHUN: Good morning, everyone. This is Steve Ethun, director of communications here at Augusta National. First of and foremost, I want to welcome Trevor Immelman, our defending Masters champion. As you all remember, Trevor posted rounds last year of 68, 68, 69 and 75 for an 8-under 280 total. That's to win by three strokes over Mr. Tiger Woods.   
 Along the way, he set a scoring record. He played the par 4s at 10-under par for the week. He also joined nine other Masters champions who posted their first three rounds in the 60s.   
 Trevor I'll remind you first played in the Masters in 1999 as an amateur. He'll be making his seventh appearance in 2009. All of us here at Augusta National are looking forward to having him back for many years to come.   
 Trevor, welcome. Thank you for taking the time to be with us today. If you could, please give us an opening comment.   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Thanks, Steve. Obviously that gives me chills listening to all those stats you were throwing out there.
