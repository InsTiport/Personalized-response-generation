Q.   65.   Your thoughts on a very tidy start.
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Yeah, obviously, excited getting a few putts going in.   That's what's kind of been holding me back the last few months and I hit a few funny shots out there but for the most part the ball didn't end up too bad and I was able to make a few birdies and keep things going.   I'm obviously very excited about it.

Q.   You've played well here before.   What seems to fit your eye about this place?
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   It's a great golf course, especially since they changed the greens and gone to the bermuda.   It's really improved this golf course substantially.   You've got to be able to hit the shots both ways here, control the distances with the irons.   It's been a course I've also enjoyed playing.

Q.   I must ask the question, it's obviously very important week.   I know you're worried about your situation.   What's the mindset coming into a week like this?
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   I have nothing to lose, to be honest.   You know, at the end of the day even if things don't work out, I'm not going to quit, I'm going to keep going and keep fighting and keep working hard and so, you know, I just got to keep going day after day and still only 33 and a long way ahead of me.

Q.   It's a great start with today.
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Thank you.
