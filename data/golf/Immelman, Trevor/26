  Q. Talk about the week and what this kind of means for you.   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, you know, it's always fantastic to come back here, whether you're coming to play in a tournament or whether you're coming to visit and play a practice round, and so it's always a special time. I mean, I regard and respect Augusta National highly. It's always nice to come here.  
  
  Q. Even when you were struggling you were playing pretty well here. What is it about this place and you?   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: That's a good question. I think, you know, I've played a lot of golf here. I love the golf course. I know exactly where I need to put the ball, and I think it just suits me, suits my game. And so, you know, I'm glad that I can come back here until I decide not to.   
  
  Q. Have you talked to Charl at all this week?   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: No, I've just said hi to him in the practice rounds. Haven't spoken to him at all.  
  
  Q. Anything about his game you think that is good for this course?   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, his game is good for every course. It looks like he's playing great, and I wish him the best of luck.  
  
  Q. You guys are -- did you guys grow up together in the amateur ranks?  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: He kind of came along just after I finished in the junior ranks, but obviously I've heard a lot about him, and he's had a fantastic career so far, so this would be great for him if he manages to pull it through today.  
  
  Q. As a Masters champion, at a tournament where you're not necessarily contending, how much pressure is there just to finish strong?  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, there's always something to play for, you know? And most of the guys out here got a lot of pride. You want to put the best score you can on the board. Even if I was finishing dead last, I'd still be trying up the 18th.
