 Q. Accuracy seems to be a big premium so far this week, especially off the tee. Talk about what it's meant to you so far this week?
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, I mean, hitting the ball in the fairway is paramount. The rough is just that perfect length where you are not sure whether it's going to come out soft or jump on you. You really have to be in the fairway, so that you can try to keep the ball below the hole and have a good birdie chance. It's crucial. 

 Q. How do you feel about your round today? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: You know, today wasn't as good as yesterday. It was a little bit more scrappy. You know, seemed like every time I made a few birdies I went straight ahead and made a few bogeys. And so I kept giving it back, and unfortunately bogeyed the last hole. So you know, just kind of hanging in there more today. 

 Q. What's mind-set and the game plan going into tomorrow? 
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, that's the same strategy that I laid out at start of the week, and hopefully hit some better shots.
