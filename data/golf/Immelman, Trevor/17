 Q.   I know it wasn't the finish you wanted but still a great round.   
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Yeah, and actually just misread that putt.   I had it exactly where I wanted it.   I was expecting it to just fall left and it went the other way, so not ideal.   But all in all, I came back and played pretty solid this morning.   
I've got a chance this afternoon, and really, that's all you want.   You want to have a shot.   You go out there and play and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   How tough was it yesterday with the delay and coming back today?   It's going to make it a long day.   
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Yeah, it's par for the course.   This is my 12th season as a pro believe it or not, so we've got a lot of these going on during the year, especially this time of year on the East Coast in the States.   We've got a lot of rain delays, a lot of thunderstorms, and it's just one of those things you get used to and roll with the punches.  
   
 Q.   This afternoon are you chasing anything or anyone or are you just going to go out there and play as best you can?   
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   You know, I think there's a long way to go still.   I don't think it's worth getting too caught up in the scores.   I think it's just a matter of me going out there and playing as well as I can, and you just hope it's enough.  
   
 Q.   The benefit of possibly not going out in the last group, it might be nice to get out ahead of the guys and put a number up.   
TREVOR IMMELMAN:   Well, because I'm not in the last group I'll agree with you, but I'd much rather have like a 10â€‘shot lead in the last group.   But it is what it is.   You go out there and you play your best, and the best man is going to win.
