  Q. Fairly solid round of golf today, talk a little about how the course is playing today?  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Yeah, I mean, I played well. I drove the ball pretty well. Gave myself, you know, some nice opportunities and I hung in there toward the end.   
 Unfortunately that 18th hole got me again, four 5s on that hole. Not sure I think it's the best finishing hole for a championship of this magnitude, but you know, all in all a pretty solid week. I'm happy with it.  
  
  Q. What did you think, if 18 were not going to be the finishing hole, is there something you would change specifically about it or just the wrong spot on the course?  
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: Well, no, it's not a very good hole at any spot, especially the finishing hole for a tournament like this.   
 I would say you could improve it dramatically by making it a par 5 and just taking us to the back tee. I mean, I'm playing with a long hitter today, Gary Woodland. He hit 4-iron off the tee and then a 2-iron into the green. That just doesn't make any sense to me. I hit a 3-wood, I'm a yard away of being perfect, it just trickled into that trap, and I have one of the worst lies you've of seen in the bunker there, and I'm forced to lay up. It's just unfortunately not as solid as the other 17 holes.  
  
  Q. Overall this week, how would you rate your performance this week?   
 TREVOR IMMELMAN: I thought I played pretty solid. I hung in there all week. You know, didn't make too many crazy mistakes. Nice week for me to build from.
