Q. A few strokes better than the last time I saw you.  And a closing birdie.  Talk about the way you finished.
BILLY ANDRADE: I drove it in the right bunker on 18 and laid up with an 8-iron and had 98 yards up the hill and just chipped a little 52 degree wedge about two feet.  So I hit a beautiful shot in there to end nicely.  I had a nice back nine, I was 3-under on the back, I was even on the front, so I'm in good position, I'm right where I need to be and looking forward to tomorrow.  Tomorrow should be a lot of fun.
Q. This is the way you wanted it to be anyway, right?
BILLY ANDRADE: Absolutely.  I think every player, we're all on the same boat, we want to have a chance, we want to have opportunities to win, especially Majors, especially a PGA, so I'm really excited that I got this opportunity and looking forward to tomorrow.
