 Q.  Assess your time here because it was just a great performance.  
BILLY ANDRADE: Yeah, it was.  I played well, I hit the ball well, I had a lot of chances.  Today just made a few too many mistakes, especially on the front nine with three bogeys.  I only had two going into this week.   
So Sundays are different, Sundays are harder, the weather was a little tougher, we started we had some rain coming down and the wind started blowing, so it played, I thought it played very hard today.   
 Q.  When is the last time you really played as solid like this coming down the stretch?  
BILLY ANDRADE: I have been playing pretty well on Champions Tour, I won three times a couple years ago, so, and last year I played pretty solid too.  So I've had a lot of good runs, I've had a lot of good finishes, but you want to win.  That's the bottom line.   
 Q.  Is this a good omen for you?  
BILLY ANDRADE: Yeah, I'm looking forward to now going to Des Moines and then I got the U.S. Open Senior Open in my backyard at Salem, so I'm really looking forward to having a chance there.
