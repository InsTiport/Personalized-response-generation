 Q. What were the keys to your round?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: I putted pretty good. I hit some good iron shots and stuff today, but I putted good. Got a you couple up-and-downs for pars that saved the round. Overall I didn't hit it great, but I made the putts, that's what you got to do.

 Q. With lift clean and place how important was it to hit it straight out there?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: Well it was, but I wasn't hitting it in the fairway was the problem. But it is. And it's wet. But they did what they had to do. They had to try to get as many holes as they could play today you know, so the guys can finish up, maybe we can get back on track by tomorrow night. 

 Q. So overall pretty happy with 69 today?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: Tickled pink. You know. Anything under par here is, this course is playing -- they moved the tees up quite a bit and shortened it down, but still, you know, the wind's blowing and it's wet and it's mushy and it's hard to hit the shots solid and stuff like that. So I took a divot on the 18th hole you could have sodded a yard with.
