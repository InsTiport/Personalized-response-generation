 Q. Talk about the hole-in-one. 
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: Yeah, I don't even know what the yardage was. I think it was 164. 

 Q. And what iron?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: 7-iron. I hit it good. It started out there to the right and it turned over and went in. 

 Q. Did it land in the hole?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: It landed just short of the hole, probably about, probably about five or six feet short. But that was the only highlight of the day. Yesterday I missed three greens, today I hit three greens. 

 Q. Did you see the shot go in?
 BRUCE VAUGHAN: Not exactly. I knew it was close, but the way the sun was shining it was very tough to see it.
