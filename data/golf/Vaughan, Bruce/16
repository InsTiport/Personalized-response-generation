  Q.  4-under.  Good score, right?   
 BRUCE VAUGHAN:  Yeah, happy.   
  
  Q.  To keep it close, was it straight driving, putting?   
 BRUCE VAUGHAN:  It was pretty good.  Yesterday I hit a couple bunkers there, but managed to get a couple of good pars in there.   
 Missed a couple, made a couple, but overall if I hit like that, stuff like that, I'll be happy here for three more days.   
  
  Q.  How did you feel the course this morning compared to --   
 BRUCE VAUGHAN:  Big break there, because if we would have -- we had 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in the wind.   
 So I'm sure it made a difference because I hit a 4-iron on that par 3, and I heard guys were hitting 3-woods or something yesterday.  It was a big turn around.   
  
  Q.  Can you recount the birdie on 8?   
 BRUCE VAUGHAN:  I hit the driver off the tee, hit a little 4-iron in there to about 25, 30 feet and rolled it in.   
  
  Q.  Thank you.  Good luck.
