 Q.   Is that your best score here on the Old Course?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Second round I've played.   First one was a practise.   
   
 Q.   How do you like St. Andrews now?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Weather's perfect the last three days, for all the courses.   
   
 Q.   Did you like it right away, the Old Course?   
CHRIS DOAK:   I played it on Monday, and that was the best of the week so it was perfect.   Played great in the practise, 6‑under after nine or something like that, so it was good.   
   
 Q.   Did you find yourself doing the tourist bit over the Swilken Bridge?   
CHRIS DOAK:   My caddie took a picture.   
   
 Q.   Who is your amateur partner?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Gordon Murray, chairman of the Links Trust.   He played well this week.   Team shot 63 today and I shot 63, so that tells you.   
   
 Q.   No dogs this week?  
CHRIS DOAK:   Dogless this week.   
   
 Q.   Do you look at Order of Merits?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Always knew I needed a good week coming into this.   Definitely playing Portugal.   
   
 Q.   Australia?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Depending.   
   
 Q.   Any of the birdies, anything really close?   
CHRIS DOAK:   1,2 and 3 we're hitting wedges in, so 90‑yard shots, so they are all kind of six feet.   I got the holes I had to get up‑and‑down and it was pretty solid.  
   
 Q.   Ten uneventful birdies?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Nine.   Same yesterday, just never holed the putts.   
   
 Q.   Is the Old Course everything you expected?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Definitely.   Like to see it with a bit of wind.   
   
 Q.   63 around the Old Course?  
CHRIS DOAK:   You wake up this morning‑‑ it's been fantastic, especially that's my second round on the Old Course, so very pleased with that.   
   
 Q.   So what were the details of the first round?   How did you get on that time?  
CHRIS DOAK:   That was a practise round on Monday.   So delighted, that's my first round on the Old Course.   
   
 Q.   I would ask what you make of it, because everybody has a different impression when they first set eyes on the course?  
CHRIS DOAK:   It's great.   You know, obviously it's a lot tougher in The Open, there's usually wind, but we've had great weather for the last three days, as you can see by the scoring.   It's a pleasure to play.   
   
 Q.   And part of the dream this morning was getting into contention?   You're nicely placed.   
CHRIS DOAK:   Yeah, that was the whole goal for the start of the week.   We'll see what happens in the morning.   
   
 Q.   What is it about you and your golf this year?  
CHRIS DOAK:   Just there's always something that's not kind of right, short game or putting, but it's all kind of clicking in now, and it's actually great to be back, you know how the ball is going to react, so it's good to be home.   
   
 Q.   Do you find a benefit of knowing that you've been into contention already this season?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Wake up tomorrow, see what happens.
