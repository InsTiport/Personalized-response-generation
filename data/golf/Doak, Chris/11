 Q.   Unlucky with the first putt?   
CHRIS DOAK:   Apart from that, it was a good day.   Much the same as yesterday, just hit the ball better off the tee today.   Missed a few left yesterday.   Still lost a couple left today but got a way with it.   Everything else has been good.   Wedge and putting‑‑ not playing the par 5s too well.   
   
 Q.   You had a poor‑ish start yesterday?  
CHRIS DOAK:   2‑over after the first four.   
   
 Q.   Were you feeling a wee bit off at Castle Stuart‑‑  
CHRIS DOAK:   No, that tournament's gone.   Now just been knocking away on the range and been knocking away on a few things for months now and just slow coming.   
   
 Q.   Anything in particular that you think has made a difference so far of the changes?   
CHRIS DOAK:   No, it's just been gradual.   The frustration, makes you want to get it quicker.   
The 9th hole is very good from the back tee.   The par5, you should always be able to go for it in two, and 18, I think the green is too severe.   Be great for The Ryder Cup, be a bit of excitement at the 18th, but in terms of me playing it, I don't like it.
