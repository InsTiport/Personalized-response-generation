  Q. Kyle, how was it playing this Pete Dye course compared to the one that got you here in the National Championship?  
 KYLE FLINTON: There's a lot of visually intimidating shots where French Lick was the same way. I think once you focus on hitting your targets, you start realizing, there is fairway out there, the greens are okay. There's just some places you just can't shoot at. But very similar, greens are about the same. I thought French Lick might have been a little bit tighter than this.   
 You know, I felt like I got off to a strong start and 3-putting 15, hit a bad shot on 17 and 18 kind of hurt on that side. But all in all, not too upset.   
  
  Q. Something you can shore up tomorrow?  
 KYLE FLINTON: There's birdies out there. You've just got to hit good shots. All of my bogeys seemed like they came on missed greens and it's tough playing out of that hay.   
 I think Oakland Hills, I was just so awestruck and like a kid in a candy store. I think I overplayed myself, and I took yesterday off and just hung out with the kids and didn't do anything and wanted to be fresh starting this morning, and I got off to a really good start. Wish I could have just maintained it a little bit more, but I think the five to 10-footers that you need to make to safe a par when you're scrambling, I just didn't have that today. So, it will come.
