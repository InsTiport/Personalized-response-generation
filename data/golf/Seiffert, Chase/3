Q. Another good round to put yourself in contention. How was it out there?
CHASE SEIFFERT: It was good. Today was probably the most grinded day of the week so far. I hit it really nice the first two days, and today I kind of hit it everywhere, but I scored well. Kind of managed my misses and made some really good putts coming down the stretch.
Q. Playing in this event for the first time, how hard is it to get to know all three courses?
CHASE SEIFFERT: It was tough. So I came out before Hawaii and played two of them. And then when we got back from Hawaii, I played the Country Club, to kind of see them all at least once. So it's tough to play -- just seeing the course once, you don't know exactly where all the misses are, but I was hitting it really good fortunately so it kind of helped.
Q. Kind of an up-and-down season so far, but you made four straight cuts coming in here. How is your game feeling?
CHASE SEIFFERT: It feels good. I was starting to play my way into good form there at the end of the year right before our little off-season. I was really trending well and started to play well and then took the off-season. I was a little rusty in Hawaii, which kind of made sense because I took a month off. But my game feels really good right now.
Q. Heading into tomorrow what's the mindset?
CHASE SEIFFERT: Just go try and make birdies. I just found out I'm five shots back I think, so just got to go out there and try to hit good shots and make some putts and see what I can do at the end of the day.
