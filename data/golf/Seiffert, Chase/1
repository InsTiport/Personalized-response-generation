Q. How would you sum up your week?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   It was great really.  I had a great few days of preparations before and had three nice rounds of ball-striking and then yesterday my short game and putter really bailed me out, but on the whole it was a great week.  I was ecstatic out there.
Q. Obviously coming in outside the top 160 in FedExCup points, now you're looking to move inside like the top 110.  As you were kind of saying to Bill, the goal post-break was to work your way into the Playoffs.  Now you're right on the cusp of that.  Do you reset some goals now?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   Absolutely.  No, now obviously secured the Playoffs, but then to try to go deeper into the Playoffs.  East Lake has been the goal all year, so that's obviously where we want to end up come September.
Q. How big of a breakthrough week was this for you?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   This was huge.  You know, I obviously believed I could do it, but it's actually nice when you go out there and pull it together and do it and pull it off.
Q. You've always had that belief, and you played at Florida State with guys like Brooks Koepka, Daniel Berger.  Now that you're kind of seeing the fruits of your labor on the work you put in and seeing some more success, how much more confidence does that give you?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   It gives you a lot.  It's so nice when you put in work and then it shows.  That's kind of what you want to do.  I worked really hard during this kind of mini-off-season that we had the last two months, and it's nice to come out and have that work kind of show.
Q. Were you already in 3M before this?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   I was.
Q. What's your schedule look like going forward?
CHASE SEIFFERT:   I'm going to play 3M and then Reno and then most likely Wyndham to finish the year.
