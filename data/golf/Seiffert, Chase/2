Q. Just start with a couple comments about the round.
CHASE SEIFFERT: Yeah, it's got to be one of my favorite rounds of all time, just to play a nice, clean round at Pebble Beach, have, like, the control I did of my golf ball. And the weather was perfect. It was really just a perfect day.
Q. How about just being at Pebble? Have you had much experience here before?
CHASE SEIFFERT: This is my first tournament round and I played 27 holes of practice before today, so I had only seen it -- this week is my first time on the property.
Q. And how did you feel coming into the week? Did you feel something like this or what, kind of, had been going right for you?
CHASE SEIFFERT: No, I had a nice week off last week. Typically coming off off-weeks I have a lot of good energy. And no, my game felt good for sure leading up to today and Pebble looks really good to my eye as well. It's always nice when you feel good and the course looks good. You can put some good scores up.
Q. Obviously, you got the rotation. Where are you tomorrow?
CHASE SEIFFERT: Spyglass.
Q. And your thoughts on that course? With that in mind, do you just kind of keep the same game plan for what worked today?
CHASE SEIFFERT: For sure, just go out there and hit a lot of greens, hopefully hit some pretty close and make some putts. I've only played 18 holes there, so I'm going to be kind of learning it a little on the fly as we go. But no, just kind of keep the pedal down and just try to make some birdies.
