 Q.  37 points, and a 34 yesterday?  
JACK WAGNER: Yeah, so 71.  I guess I'll be in the top four.   
 Q.  You're in the top three or four right now.  So you've got a couple guys still coming in.  How was it today?  Just go through it.  
JACK WAGNER: It was good, solid.  No mistakes, just real solid.  Got a birdie on the par 5 -- where did I get it?  I don't even remember.  I got one on 6, a par 4.  I got one on 10, a bogey on 11.  Then birdied the par 5.  And just a little clumsy.  I had 6-footers for birdie on 16 and 17, didn't make.  Par putt 5 feet, didn't make on 18.  I got a little tired, and I'm 1 under today, so that's what I got.   
 Q.  You shot 71 today.  What did you shoot yesterday?  
JACK WAGNER: I was probably about 1 over yesterday.  Five birdies, though, so that got me more points.   
 Q.  Solid with pars, so you're right in the hunt.  Definitely like the format, more points now?  
JACK WAGNER: You know what, I think it's good for everybody because just the psychological aspect.  I think the players that aren't as good as well as the good players will just kind of like feel a little better and not doubles will pull us back.  And a bogey's a point.  I think confidence-wise, the better players are going to win, but I think confidence-wise it just keeps in there a little more.   
 Q.  You mentioned the four rounds, and you mentioned right now you got a little tired toward the end.  How is that going to play on Sunday for you, do you think?  
JACK WAGNER: You know what, we'll see.  I'm really a conditioned kind of guy.  So I go to the gym after I play.  I hit balls after I play.  Today I'm going to lay down.
