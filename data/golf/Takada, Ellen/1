  ELLEN TAKADA: We were all square on hole 17, right, and I birdied the last hole, and we won the match.  It was really -- my hand was really shaking, and it was really tough, but yeah.Q. You made the winning putt, didn't you?ELLEN TAKADA: I did, yeah.  It was like six foot.Q. You gave a little fist pump there at the end?ELLEN TAKADA: Because I knew I've got to make it.Q. Do you think that's kind of one of the most exciting golf memories you have or the best kind of clutch putt?  Have you done something like that before?ELLEN TAKADA: No, I guess not.  Yeah, that putt was really special for me, yeah.Q. And you have your mom on the bag, right?ELLEN TAKADA: Yeah, I played alone the last three days, but yeah, I asked my mom to help me.Q.

He's a great caddie.Q. How is your mom adjusting to -- has she done this before, caddied for you?ELLEN TAKADA: Yeah, she's done it, like USGA women's other tournaments, but she encourages me.Q. How were you guys feeling this afternoon?ELLEN TAKADA: Really good, yes, really good.  I have to miss school, but it's good.Q. It's worth it?ELLEN TAKADA: Uh-huh, right.Q.

I played 36 holes today -- not 36 holes, but almost.Q. Any particular spots in the second round or in the second match today where you thought you guys played particularly well?ELLEN TAKADA: No, I don't think so.  We work on staying very consistent, and we tried not to make bogeys.  She made birdies and I made birdies, so it was good.  It was good not to have like birdies on the same hole.Q. That's helpful.ELLEN TAKADA: Yeah, yeah.Q. You'll be coming up to the Northwest for college.
