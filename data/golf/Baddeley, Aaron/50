 Q. A solid seven birdies, one bogey, 6-under par 66, low round of the day. You Australians can play in the wind?
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, growing up in the wind definitely helps. Especially around here because today was really windy.

 Q. What was the key to your round?
 AARON BADDELEY: I made a couple good saves, and that was definitely the key, to keep momentum. And I putted nice. I holed a couple -- just holed out well from 15 feet and inside.

 Q. When did the wind stop for you? Was it five, six, seven holes left?
 AARON BADDELEY: No, it was probably like on 16 tee really. We had I think three to go. It's still blowing a little bit. But by that time it was downbreeze, so it actually would have been nice if it stayed up.

 Q. You definitely played yourself into contention for the weekend; how does that feel and what are you looking forward to?
 AARON BADDELEY: I was a little disappointed yesterday but then came out today and played really good. It is always nice to be in contention and we have two rounds together. Just need to go out there and keep playing the way I'm playing and hopefully just stay right there.

 Q. Are you doing especially good, the best part of your game? 
 AARON BADDELEY: Everything is pretty solid. The key for me right now is really just making a few putts, and if I can do that, then the good play should continue.
