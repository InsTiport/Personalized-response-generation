 Q. Obviously very tight match all the way through?
 AARON BADDELEY: It was nice, we both played great on the front nine, and then the back side, we got back to square. Unfortunately he missed a lot of putts coming in.

 Q. How well do you feel you're playing?
 AARON BADDELEY: I feel like I'm playing pretty good. Just got to clean up a couple of shots here and there but overall feel like I'm playing well.

 Q. World No. 1 this afternoon, Lee Westwood, you must have a cunning plan?
 AARON BADDELEY: Play good. The thing about golf is all you can do is control your own golf ball. All I can do is go out there and play my best, and it should be a great challenge. 

 Q. Tight match against Anders Hansen. How do you feel about this afternoon's match with Lee?
 AARON BADDELEY: We both played very nicely, and this afternoon should be good. I'm looking forward to the challenge of playing against Lee. I feel like I'm playing pretty good, so should be a good challenge.
