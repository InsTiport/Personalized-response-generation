 Q. Can you talk about what went well for you?
 AARON BADDELEY: Today was a good day. I drove the ball very nicely and hit a lot of greens in regulation. If I missed the green, it was pretty much on the fringe where I could putt it. 
 So I really gave myself a lot of opportunities to make some birdies and sort of a stress-free day.

 Q. So a five birdie, no bogey round? 
 AARON BADDELEY: Correct, yeah. It was a good day. I actually slept in. I slept past my alarm so I was a bit late getting to the practice tee, so it was nice to get a good day.

 Q. How much did the course change on you today, and how much do you expect it to change going into the weekend? 
 AARON BADDELEY: It was pretty similar today to yesterday afternoon. Maybe, if anything, it was a little softer because we got to play in the morning. I expect it to continue, especially if the weather stays like this, to firm up and get faster and harder, which I'm very pleased about. Makes it more like Australian golf.
