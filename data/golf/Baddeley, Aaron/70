 Q.  Just talk about what you had going today. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I felt like I played nice today, except for just a couple of tee shots.  Overall I felt like I played very well.  I hit my irons nice and I putted nice. 

 Q.  You play well out in Arizona.  Is there something about desert courses that you like? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I don't know, the greens here are fantastic, and the ball flies a little bit further, so I guess I'm just used to how the ball flies here. 

 Q.  Do you like match play? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I do.  I enjoy match play.  It sort of brings back memories of being an amateur, and it's sort of nice to be head-to-head.  It's just different.  It's a breakup from the norm. 

 Q.  Anything else you're looking forward to the rest of the week? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.  You can't get ahead of yourself.  It has to be one match at a time.
