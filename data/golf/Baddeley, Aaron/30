Q.   Aaron, good day at the office, just comment on your round? 
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah it was a good day.   Got off to a really good start, first six holes are key and disappointed to bogey 7, but played really good the last few holes and nearly made the putt on 17 and miss‑read that putt on the last.

Q.   Did you have a number in mind coming into the day? 
AARON BADDELEY:   15.   I thought if I get to 15, I thought that was a good chance.   Obviously you had to get off to a good start, and did that.   And once I did that, it's like, come on, and didn't quite get it going through the middle and finished strong. 

Q.   Watching the boards throughout the day? 
AARON BADDELEY:   Once I saw Charlie was like 3‑over early, I saw him and Kevin and Phil were tied for the lead at 12 and was like, have a chance here.   Looks like Phil's pushed on.   But overall I was pleased.   Game has been building in this direction, so similar pattern so last year at the same time.

Q.   And your schedule coming up? 
AARON BADDELEY:   Next week and then Match Play.
