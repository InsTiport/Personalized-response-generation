Q. Aaron, second consecutive bogie-free, 4-under, 68 for you today.  You're making it look pretty easy out there.  Get some comments on your round.
AARON BADDELEY: Just a solid day.  Hit a lot of fairways and greens.  Especially with the wind like this, had a 2-putt and I had birdie opportunities all the way around.
Q. Talked with Sung Kang at 16-under right now.  You're 8 shots back.  Playing so well.  What's the key to that in terms of your mindset going into the weekend?
AARON BADDELEY: Got to play your own game.  It was a difficult day today.  The wind got up pretty good out there and really needed to just be patient and just not try and force the issue.
Q. A place you really hike.  Comment a little bit about what it is about this course that suits you so well.
AARON BADDELEY: The greens are super quick.  They're the quickest in four, five years.  I really like that.  You can hit the putt the way it is it goes in.  That plays to my strength.  I've had a lot of opportunities.
