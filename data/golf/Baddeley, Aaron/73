 Q. The North Course a lot of times is kind of a ho-hum thing.  Today it's good work.  It's not the toothless Tiger it used to be, is it? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Absolutely not.  One of the biggest challenges is all the par-5s play into the wind.  I mean, I hit 3-wood into every one of them.  It was a good day. 

 Q.  You got three birdies on the four par-5s. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I hit good tee shots on most of them, and I was able to get it down there where I could just chip and putt. 

 Q.  This year your Adams equipment, you're starting to feel more comfortable with it, this now the third tournament you've used it? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Actually I won the Australian Masters using my 3-wood and 5-wood which I still had in the bag, so I feel very comfortable with it. 

 Q.  Going next week to defend at FBR, are you starting to get excited about that already? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I'm looking forward to it, but I've got some work to do on the weekend here. 
 Next week is going to be great, but hopefully this weekend is great, too.
