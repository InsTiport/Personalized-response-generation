 Q.  Early morning for you, but you finished it in style with a 2 on the 18th. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, that was a nice way to finish, just sort of felt like I squandered a few shots out there.  It was nice to make a 2 on the last. 

 Q.  There was weather yesterday, there's weather perhaps coming on the way today.  How do you prepare yourself mentally for what could be a long day with rain delays. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  You're guessing there's going to be rain delays, so you just sort of play as hard as you can when you're out there and make sure you stay focused.  It's easy not to be as focused as you need to be when you think there's rain coming.  You've just got to play hard for the holes until the horn goes. 

 Q.  You've had a really good run during the entire stretch of the PGA TOUR Playoffs for the FedExCup.  Is it starting to get fatiguing with rain delays out here and your month of four straight tournaments and four good tournaments well-played and a lot of concentration? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I'm feeling pretty good.  If I have to get up at 4:00 tomorrow morning it could be a little tiresome.  It's been not too bad, but definitely looking forward to having a few weeks off.
