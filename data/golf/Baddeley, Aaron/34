 Q. Obviously a tough match there today, but if you can just give us a quick recap, that would be great. 
 JASON DAY: We got out of the blocks pretty quick. Obviously we were 2-up through ten holes. But you know, a little -- after what happened on 11, that kind of hit the brakes and the momentum stopped. They rolled in a good putt on 12, and obviously -- and 13, and then 14, as well -- 15. 
 So it was just more about momentum than anything. You know, we had it going our way for the first nine holes, and you know, it was just unfortunate. We played our heart out. That's just the way golf goes. 

 Q. You were down and then just hanging on at 16, a great bunker shot by you, Aaron. 
 AARON BADDELEY: They made four birdies in the last six holes or something. So yeah, it was just a little hard to keep up. We just didn't quite get it done today, but this afternoon we'll go out this afternoon and try and get a point and get it back to being a match.
