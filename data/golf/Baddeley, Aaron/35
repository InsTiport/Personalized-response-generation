 Q. You played well in both matches, just you came up short. Talk about your day today. 
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, just couldn't quite get it going. We played decent. Made both our guys beat us. We didn't lose our matches. Those guys played well enough to beat us unfortunately. This morning the guys made five birdies in seven holes or something to finish up the match, and then this afternoon, just couldn't quite get -- made a little charge there on 10 and 11, and then Bill came back with birdies on 12 and 13. 
 So a little unlucky on 15 with our second shot -- on 16, sorry. But made a great putt to win it for them. 

 Q. Sometimes you play poorly and win and sometimes you play well and lose, kind of the case? 
 AARON BADDELEY: Exactly. The biggest thing is making them beat you. We played well enough to win both matches and unfortunately our opponents just played a little bit better.
