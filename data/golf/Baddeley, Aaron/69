  Q.  What are you going to do now?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  I asked the guys if I can go out and play holes.  I'm going to tee off at my original tee time or I can wait until after the guys.  I'll wait until they tee off and then I'll go play some holes.   
  
  Q.  Because this is match play as opposed to stroke play, is there anything that messes up your rhythm at all when you go play by yourself and not have a match play before you play again tomorrow?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  I'm actually think of going out and playing like a nine-hole match against par type of thing, where I can just go out and actually hit shots and leave about a four- or five-footer for par and tinker around with it so I feel like I'm having a match because this is a little bit different than stroke play.   
  
  Q.  Talk about playing Oakmont with Tiger.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  I wouldn't say it caught me off guard.  I've played with Tiger at the Masters twice before that so I know the crowds are big and they're noisy.  I've played good with Tiger before.  I enjoy playing with Tiger; he's the best player in the world.  He's fun to play with.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  I mean, it's either Tiger or Arron.  So I'm definitely not discounting that Arron can win today.
