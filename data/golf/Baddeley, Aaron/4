Q. 26 points.  Clubhouse leader right now through two rounds.  Just comment on another good day out there.
AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, it's a tough day today.  The wind was really gusting and gusting in different directions.  You really had to wait until it was your turn to hit, pick a club.  Because it could be 15 downwind, switch and be 15 straight in to you.  It was just crazy.  Played really nicely today.  Drove the ball beautifully.  It was a good day.
Q. No matter the format being played, always going bogey-free is a good thing?
AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, absolutely.  Going forward with your points.  That's a good day.  Played solid.  Didn't get in any trouble.  Putted nicely.  Did everything nicely.
Q. I know you didn't finish the way you wanted to last week, but snapping that missed cut streak was big for you coming down the stretch, gained a little momentum?
AARON BADDELEY: Absolutely.  Felt like I had a couple of weird months.  My game's been pretty good.  I haven't capitalized with the putter and just been working really hard on that.  Been hitting the ball pretty solid this week.  I'm hitting the ball well and making a few extra putts, which has been nice.
Q. How special is it top on top of the leaderboard going into the weekend?
AARON BADDELEY: It's definitely a position to be in.  That side of the week, if you say you're leading through two days, you would take it and sit in the clubhouse.  Definitely exciting to be in that spot.  And hopefully we can stay there the rest of the weekend.
Q. How does this elevation put a factor into --
AARON BADDELEY: My yardage book, I changed all the numbers to ten percent less.  So then there's less numbers going on out there.  So we know up here if you give it a little extra it's going to go.  So I have played here about eight times.  Have a feel for it.
