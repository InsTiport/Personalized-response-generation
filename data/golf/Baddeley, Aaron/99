Q.
Talk about your round today.
AARON BADDELEY:  I got off to a scrappy start and then made the turn and played real nice.  I hit a lot of good shots, played really good.  Gave myself a lot of chances and actually missed a lot of putts today.

If I would have made a couple putts, I would have shot a really nice round.
Q.  What do you think of the golf course?
AARON BADDELEY:  It's amazing.  I wish I we could play more on ones like this.  It tests your game, you have to drive it straight, hit your irons well and you've got to use your short game.
Q.  It's the longest course in major championship history.  Was it any problem for you?
AARON BADDELEY:  Didn't feel like that.  I guess the par 3s are long here.  I mean, you're hitting    yeah, it didn't really feel like that.  I guess because the fairways are reasonably quick, so it was okay.
Q.  What was your favorite shot today?
AARON BADDELEY:  My tee shot on 7, the par 5.  I just got there about 340 and hit a really nice 4 iron just on the edge of the green.
Q.  What do you think you'll be able to do tomorrow?
AARON BADDELEY:  I think just keep doing what I'm doing.
