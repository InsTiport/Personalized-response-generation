  Q.  10 today, a little weird with the wind and where you ended up.  Take me through it a little bit.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, the 10th hole is a great little hole.  I think the 10th hole shows you that a par 4 doesn't need to be 500 yards to be challenging.  I hit my tee shot in the right bunker and from there, it's like all straight downhill.  I hit an okay bunker shot, not exactly the way I wanted to and just kept going into the other bunker and hit it out and that's a tough shot, as well.   
 It's such a great little hole.   
  
  Q.  What's the good place to miss there, is there a good place to miss?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, left side of the green off the tee is the spot, because then you're sort of chipping back up the hill and everything breaks to the left.  So even if the pin is cut left, you can still feed it in there pretty close.   
  
  Q.  We were there for six groups today and only saw two guys not go for it.  What makes -- obviously today the wind was behind you, but with the wind behind you, is there a time when you don't go for it?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  I would say no, just because of the wedge shot.  If the pin is cut in that back corner, it's a tough wedge shot because the green is only 10, 12, 15 feet wide.  Yesterday both Retief and David laid up, and they both missed the green with their little wedge shots.  So it's a tough shot.
