  AARON BADDELEY: Overall it was a good day. Overall played quite nice. So, yeah, it was good.   
  
  Q. And what do you need to do well?  
 AARON BADDELEY: Well, around here, fairways is a huge advantage.   
  
  Q. Driving?   
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah. And then just shaping the ball a little bit into the greens. Those are the two things.   
  
  Q. And the experience of playing in China overall?   
 AARON BADDELEY: Excellent. I come here all the time. I come here every year. It's my first time playing here, though, so nice to be in this one. I came here a lot but first time I played here. Everyone's great.   
  
  Q. And the conditions of the course?   
 AARON BADDELEY: Perfect. Quite nice greens. The greens are great. Excellent.   
  
  Q. And looking forward to Australia?   
 AARON BADDELEY: I can't wait to get down there next week at the Open, and in The Presidents Cup and then the PGA. So got a great run of events there in Australia.  
  
  Q. And The Presidents Cup, what did it mean to you to make that team?  
 AARON BADDELEY: It was huge. After winning in L.A., and then being there in '98, watching, to be a part of the team now, is amazing. It's a dream.   
  
  Q. Obviously your form seems to be good, coming down into that stretch, Aussie open, Presidents Cup?  
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, it's good. I've had five weeks off. Haven't played for five weeks. Been back home practising and playing at home. So I feel rested and feel ready to go.
