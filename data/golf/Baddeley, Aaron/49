  Q. The golf course was receptive today?  
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah. Very little wind today, which made it a lot easier. The greens were a nice firmness. You could sort of go at it if you wanted to.  
  
  Q. You can almost see a renewed confidence in your game developing over the last few months.  
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, definitely. Feel like I've put in a lot of good work last two years and seeing the fruit of it.  
  
  Q. And of course you're a family man, involved with raising some young children. Those are pleasant distractions over the last couple years.  
 AARON BADDELEY: Yeah, absolutely. I've got two little girls, two and a half and ten months.  
  
  Q. Give me your thoughts going into Sunday.  
 AARON BADDELEY: Got to keep being patient. That's the key. I mean, depends on the weather tomorrow, whether it's windy or not. Either way, you still got to be patient all the time and just sort of keep on going.  
  
  Q. Wind is in the forecast. They say when the wind is up, watch the Aussies move up the leaderboard.  
 AARON BADDELEY: We're used to playing in a lot of wind. Wind will be fine by me.  
  
  Q. How do you feel going into the final round?  
 AARON BADDELEY: I feel pretty good. I played really nice today. Hit a lot of good shots and it was a good day.  
  
  Q. Looking around on the leaderboard, you got plenty of company.  
 AARON BADDELEY: It's definitely a packed leaderboard. Scott is playing well.  
  
  Q. They say Saturday is moving day. Climb your way up to the top.  
 AARON BADDELEY: Today the weather was perfect and the golf course was outstanding. So if you play well, you can shoot a good score.
