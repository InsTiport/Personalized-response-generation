Q. You have to be really happy to you.  No bogies as well.  What would you rather take, the 4 birdies or no bogies?
AARON BADDELEY: Both.  No bogies, though, is good because you know you played well and then also every birdie you make, you go further under the card.  Nice today.  Played very solid.
Q. Obviously we know your strength is that putter.  Want to know when it rained yesterday, the greens were going to be a little bit slower.  Good or bad for you?
AARON BADDELEY: They weren't slow at all.  They were quick today.  You didn't have to think about getting into -- getting it to the hole at all.  Ball was rolling out nicely.  This course is perfect.  The greens are perfect.  Get it on line, it's going in.
Q. If an inch and third of rain doesn't do anything to them, what will the place be like in a couple days?
AARON BADDELEY: Firms up and super quick.  That would be ideal.  Growing up in Australia, that would be good.
Q. Good play, good start.
AARON BADDELEY: Thank you very much.
