  Q. Stuck on 66, not a bad number, birdie on the last hole pretty important in the scheme of things now that we know it's 54 holes?  
 AARON BADDELEY: Absolutely. I was guessing it was going to be 54 holes so I was just trying to shoot as low as could I today to try to get as many under as could I, so I would be somewhere near the lead or around the lead.  
  
  Q. Was there anything posted in the locker room or any talk yesterday, or is just all circumstance of what the players were talking about?  
 AARON BADDELEY: It's all what we were sort of guessing. Luke Donald mentioned it and it sort of made sense to do, and I said that's probably what they are going to do because it makes the most sense. Today I was trying to make as many birdies as I could.   
  
  Q. With the size of some of these towers they don't look that big like on 18 on the front side but when you come from the back side they are 70 feet tall and we have to think about more than just you guys being safe out on the golf course?  
 AARON BADDELEY: Absolutely, you've really got to take care of everybody. So it's really just trying to get it done and get things down before the storm comes.
