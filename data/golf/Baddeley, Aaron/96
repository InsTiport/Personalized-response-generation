 Q.  Good playing, 6-under.  Maybe just talk about your day today. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I had a good day.  I got off to a nice start.  I was at 2-under early.  I had a couple good saves on the front nine there.  That's what the day was like.  Whenever I missed the green I got up-and-down.  If I hit a green, I made a birdie. 

 Q.  Did you one-putt every green on the back side? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Do you know how many one-putts you had off the top of your head? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  14. 

 Q.  That will help your putting stats. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Where do you live? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Five minutes from here. 

 Q.  Does this tournament have any significance to you living close to it, or is it -- I don't want to say a hassle, but are there a lot of people that want tickets and that sort of thing? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I mean, it's not that they want tickets, but it's sort of like my home tournament.  I've been here seven years and I know a lot of people, and my wife is from here, all of her family is here.  So I've got a lot of family in town, a lot of friends.  I love playing here.  It's great. 

 Q.  Just generally speaking, the state of your game right now?  Do you feel good? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I feel real good.  I'm driving the ball straight.  I drove it real nice today. 
 Yeah, I putted nice.  I feel very comfortable. 

 Q.  Especially with the way you putt, what do you need to do really well to win out here that you maybe didn't do -- 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I mean, my driving has really improved in the last 12, 18 months.  I'm driving it really nice.  And then just making sure you hit a lot of greens.  Hitting a lot of greens is key because the more birdie opportunities, the better.
