 Q.   Can you just talk about your round a little bit.  
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, it was a good day.   Obviously two eagles on the back side, which is always nice to make eagle, because you pick up a couple real quick.   Overall I felt like I played really well.   Even though I had two bogeys‑‑ I was in a big divot in the middle of the fairway.   But besides that, I putted nicely, the golf course is really beautiful, too.   With the conditions like they are, you have to just be patient and keep making birdies.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel good closing out with an eagle to head into tomorrow?  
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, I finished birdie, eagle, so you couldn't ask for a better finish.   I hit good shots there.   I hit it four or five feet for eagle, it's always nice to hit a couple good shots and finish strong.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel pretty comfortable with 8‑under heading in, I mean everyone shoots pretty low here.  
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, you got to shoot low here.   To get off to a good start like that is great.  
There's still three days to go, so you just got to keep making birdies.
