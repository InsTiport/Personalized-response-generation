 Q.  How did the golf course play out there today? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  It played long, just with the rain and not getting any run out there like the course usually plays.  It was a tough day, just windy and rainy.  It wasn't a fun day. 

 Q.  Most guys in the off-season take some time off.  You went back down to Australia and won the Australian Masters.  Pretty good success over the holidays. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I played nice down in Australia.  I had a chance to win both.  It was great to win The Masters.  I had two weeks off and I really felt ready to go here.  I was looking forward to getting here and playing well. 

 Q.  Back-to-back years, played here last year and this year.  Does it make you want to keep coming back?  Of course you have to win to do that, but you really want to come back? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I think if you can get back here every year you know you've done well the previous year.  That's always the goal at the start of the year.  For me this year I'd like to win two PGA TOUR events.  After winning one the last couple years, I think it's going to have to be a two-win season. 

 Q.  A little equipment change in the off-season, switching over to Adams Golf?  How is that working out? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Going great.  I'm really excited about the new deal and excited about the equipment.  Yeah, it hasn't been much of an adjustment, so it's been great.
