 Q.   At one point you were inside the top 70 and you dropped back.   In your mind are you keeping up with that as you're playing along?  
AARON BADDELEY:   It's hard not to.   At the start of the day if I got to 6 I thought I'd be safe as houses.   I got off to a flier and just couldn't quite close.  
   
 Q.   At 18 if you had holed out from that bunker you would have gotten in the top 70.   You needed an eagle, and you came close.   That was a pretty good shot there.   
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, if I would have made eagle I would have had a chance.   I didn't hit the bunker shot that I wanted.   I thought it might spin over to the right and go in.  
   
 Q.   I hear the frustration in your voice.   What are the plans now for the next few weeks?   
AARON BADDELEY:   Well, I'm not playing.  
   
 Q.   Going to go home and rest and get started on the Fall Series?  
AARON BADDELEY:   I don't know.   I'll see.   We're having a baby, which we're excited about.   So I'm not sure if I'm going to play any of the series yet.   Just take some time off, enjoy the family and enjoy the baby.   I really have no idea.   I wasn't planning on being out of the Playoffs.
