  Q.  You have to feel good about your position going into the weekend.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, definitely.  I played really nice on the front side today and just a little bit scrappy on the back nine.   
 But I feel very comfortable with how I'm playing, and being only three back, I mean, there's quite a few people there.  So go out tomorrow and have a good day of it and just have a chance on Sunday.   
  
  Q.  3 and 18 played as two of the toughest holes on the PGA TOUR yesterday, why were they playing so tough?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, 3 was straight into the wind and 18 is like in off the left.  So for a right-hander, it's not the easiest shot to be able to aim at the water and the chance that the wind is going to move about.   
 Yeah, they are just tough golf holes.  You've just got to really bear down and hit good shots.   
  
  Q.  Preparation for Augusta, is the mind on this week?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  The mind is definitely on this week because I mean, this is a WGC, this is a big event.  So you've got obviously the best players in the world are here, so you want to play well and have a chance on Sunday to win.   
  
  Q.  Three back with Tiger in the lead, does that change your approach at all?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  No, not at all.  Obviously you expect him to go out and play well tomorrow, but who knows, golf is a crazy game.  Tiger put up a couple of average round last week but obviously he's playing very nice, a very good score today, 6-under.  I expect Tiger to play well.  Just means I'm going to having out and play well as well.
