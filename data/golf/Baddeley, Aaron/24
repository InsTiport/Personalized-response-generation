  AARON BADDELEY:   Putted nicely, so 4‑under was a nice start.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the conditions on the course?  
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, the day sort of‑‑ the wind progressively picked up as the day went on, so the thing about this golf course is there's a lot of cross‑winds, there's not as many downwind or into the wind holes, it's mainly a cross‑wind course, so it definitely demands your attention.  
   
 Q.   Are you confident about your game?  
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, 4‑under par is a good stat, especially with an afternoon round today.   I putted nicely, which you've got to do around here, so looking forward to getting out early tomorrow.   Should be nice and calm in the morning, and see if we can shoot another score.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything you need to work on?   
AARON BADDELEY:   Yeah, if I can get a couple irons a little sharper, then I'll be pleased.
