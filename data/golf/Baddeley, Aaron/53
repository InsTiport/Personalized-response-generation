 Q. How would you assess your round 3? 
 AARON BADDELEY: I think it was a very solid day. Besides two tee shots, I felt like I played really good today, just very solid tee to green and really just made no mistakes.

 Q. Is there anything in your game right now that you attribute to the good play?
 AARON BADDELEY: I feel like I've been doing things good for a while and definitely striking the ball beautifully, hitting lots and lots of greens, which makes it easier and gives me lots of birdie opportunities. I'm excited about where it's at, where the game is at, and looking forward to tomorrow's challenge.

 Q. You have a mixed bag of contenders for tomorrow. You have Kevin Na who's one of the better players on TOUR without a win, you've gone through swing changes, ups and downs but are a victor on TOUR, and then you have Fred. What do you expect tomorrow?
 AARON BADDELEY: I expect a good duel. We're all playing well. Freddie has obviously had a lot of success on the Champions Tour, so he has the feelings in there, knows how to win, so I think tomorrow is going to be a good challenge for all of us. But I think you've got to watch for other guys coming through, as well, the guys that are at 7 and 8, because if you can get it going out there, you can shoot a low one.

 Q. I know you idolized Australian golfers growing up and had a great junior career. Did you idolize Fred Couples? Do you have any memories of watching him as a boy?
 AARON BADDELEY: Not so much, no. I was more focused on Greg Norman. I mean, no, because really around '93, '94 was when I started getting into the game, and Freddie won at Augusta before I sort of got into the game.
