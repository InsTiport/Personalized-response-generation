  Q.  Aaron, terrific finish, 3 down, six to play.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, it was a tough match.  Luke is so steady.  He's such a solid player.  I just knew I needed to keep hanging in there, hanging in there.  I knew I was going to have to win it, he wasn't going to lose it.  So that's what I did, kept hanging in there, kept hitting good golf shots.   
  
  Q.  When you're 3 down with six to play, what were you thinking, keep going?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I just kept thinking if I can just get one back then that just shifts the momentum because I didn't win a hole up until I think it's 13.  So I knew if I could just get a win on a hole I could just turn the momentum around, and that's what happened.   
 I won 13 and then I won 14, so now I had momentum on my side, which is key in match play, and sort of rode it all the way home.   
  
  Q.  Luke is a tough match player, isn't he?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, because he's so steady.  I mean, he's such a straight, solid ball striker, good short game, good putter, and he's just got a good overall game.  I knew I was going to have to play well today to beat him.   
  
  Q.  Progressing on nicely, third round.  Who have you got?   
 AARON BADDELEY:  The winner of this match.   
  
  Q.  Henrik.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Okay, Henrik then.   
  
  Q.  Tough one.   
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  Henrik and I get along well.  It's going to be a fun match.
