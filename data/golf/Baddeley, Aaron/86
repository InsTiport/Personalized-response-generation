 Q.  Good way to finish, huh? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, it was a nice way to finish. 

 Q.  Just talk about the round and you're still in the hunt and no one has really run away. 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I was surprised no one really went -- there were a few guys that went low today obviously, but the leaders were -- I played really nice today.  I hit the ball beautiful, drove it beautiful, just didn't make any putts.  I hit a lot of good putts that just hit the edges.  I was in the range, shot 1-under, which I'm pleased because I played nicely. 

 Q.  They're going to come back tomorrow and they're going to have this whole tournament put to bed by 3:00 because of weather.  Supposedly the forecast is bad, just your mental preparation going into that, and are you prepared for bad weather? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  I think you've just got to expect bad weather, expect to have a delay, and then if you don't, then it's a bonus. 

 Q.  Is it exciting that nobody in the lead group ran away? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I think anyone can climb back, I think.  Anyone can win because as we've seen, there are some low numbers out there.  Tomorrow is obviously going to be the hardest pins and the greens are going to be fast, so to shoot a low number tomorrow, you're going to have to play really well. 

 Q.  Is this a good position for tomorrow?  Are you still able to swing it pretty freely? 
 AARON BADDELEY:  Yeah, I was just trying to make birdies coming in, after missing at 15.  Like I said, you've just got to try and finish as strong as you can and get as close to the lead as you can so tomorrow there's less work to do.
