  SIMON THORNTON:   Played lovely.   It's always nice to get off to a good start.   Hit the ball lovely off the tee which helps, and I have to say, coming from the practice round on Tuesday, which was terrible for me, it's a complete change around in the game.   So hitting it straight off the tee and had loads of chances, yeah.

Q.   Did you fancy your chances this week‑‑ or I was going to say‑‑ but after that practice round, probably not?
SIMON THORNTON:   Not particularly, no, I'll be honest, no.   But over the last few weeks, I've been playing much more consistently and much better.   Yeah, I've played nicely.

Q.   And many positives from Italy the other week?
SIMON THORNTON:   Exactly, you learn from what went wrong on Sunday for me, but you can also learn from the first three days on me the way I stayed in there and the way you're striking the ball and scoring.   But when you're striking the ball and scoring like that, the game tends to come a bit easy to you.

Q.   Different kind of track entirely this week?
SIMON THORNTON:   Completely different, different temperatures, as well.   But it's great to play here and I love Portugal as a country and certainly this part of the world is great.

Q.   This time of year, do you set goals or targets? 
SIMON THORNTON:   No.   My only target is literally the next shot.   It is a clichÃ© but it is what I'm doing.   I like to set small targets within my game and then the bigger targets as in keeping card, Race to Dubai, all that sort of stuff, takes care of themselves; winning tournaments, they all take care of themselves. 

Q.   This time of year, you don't have to look to keeping your card?
SIMON THORNTON:   Exactly, the target for me, when I won St. Omer was next year, not this year.   This year was a bonus, to get accustomed to it again, to get playing again and then next year the hard work starts.

Q.   And I'm sure we asked about your thumb in Italy but how is it now?
SIMON THORNTON:   Yeah, it's still strapped up.   It's the same.   It's not going to go to go away at the moment.   I have some exercises to do and stuff.   Thankfully I don't need an operation which is good news.   Yeah, just helps it.
