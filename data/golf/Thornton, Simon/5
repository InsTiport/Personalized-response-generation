 Q. After two rounds, you said you were just going to take it round by round, but after three rounds, it's still going to plan. 
 SIMON THORNTON: Still going to plan, yeah, round by round. Three down, one to go. If someone said to me after the first round, four 67s, would you be satisfied; there's three of them, have to see what happens tomorrow.

 Q. You've been consistent; do you enjoy seeing your name on the leaderboard? 
 SIMON THORNTON: Yeah, I do. I have to say now; in the past, because it hasn't happened that often yet, but it does get nerve-wracking but today I seem to be relaxed. 
 Just, you know, stay in the present, just another shot. I'm concentrating really hard on staying in the present.

 Q. Is that because you feel so confident about your game? 
 SIMON THORNTON: Yeah, exactly. You know at this level that anybody up there has a chance of winning and anybody who is four, five, six shots back still has a chance of winning. If I just keep concentrating on my own game and what I can do with my little golf ball, that's fine, yeah.

 Q. You're going to be in the final group and same group as the leader, are you saying that you're going to ignore everything else that's going on behind you?
 SIMON THORNTON: Yeah, he's going to play his own shots, what he thinks are the right shots. I'm going to play my own shots, mind how far I can hit the ball, what my strengths or and my weaknesses or, and I'll play to them, yeah.

 Q. A Top-10 would get you into next week at The French Open, as well, and a lot that could be achieved tomorrow. 
 SIMON THORNTON: There is, there is but I'm not dwelling on that at the moment. I have a lot of things to do before then with 18 holes of golf and hopefully 67 shots again and we will see.
