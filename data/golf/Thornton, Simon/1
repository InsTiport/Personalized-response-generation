  SIMON THORNTON:   If you take the wind away from the course, which is obviously the defence, then you can score low on it but today with the breeze as it is, 2‑under is pretty good.   I'm happy with that.   
It definitely picked up as we carried on, certainly into the back nine, it was a couple of clubs.   And it was hard to judge.   You stand on the tee box‑‑ it's tough to judge, as well.  
   
 Q.   Would you say you like it?  
SIMON THORNTON:   Suits my game.   Coming from Newcastle, play in it most of the times, so suits my game down to the ground.  
Course management is key, sort of hit it in the right places off the fairway, you can score.  
   
 Q.   I take it it's the first real round in a while?   
SIMON THORNTON:   Yeah, I played 18 holes on Monday and nine on another day and that was it, under even hit a golf ball.   Go out and see what happens.   Not so bad so far.  
   
 Q.   A good break after Nelson Mandela?  
SIMON THORNTON:   Yeah, 3 1/2 weeks, something like that, it was good to get home and see the family.   It was good.  
   
 Q.   Are you able to reflect on the year?   
SIMON THORNTON:   Yeah, it was a great year, calendar year, everything on an upward curve so like to continue to that.   Had a few weeks over Christmas to relax and had the turkey dinner and now it's back to work.   
   
 Q.   Does it make you feel better about yourself, your game, knowing that you're in an elite field?   
SIMON THORNTON:   Yeah, you can relax and you know that you can compete with these guys.   Obviously they are all names and they are all big names and you can compete, give it a go, see what happens really.
