Q. An adventurous morning by the looks of your card?
PETER O'MALLEY:  One bad shot from the middle of the fairway at the 16th into the water but apart from that I only missed one other green and a couple of fairways. I putted really nicely and made a nice little birdie run in the middle of my back nine.
Q. Did you have a chance at your last to tie the lead?
PETER O'MALLEY:   Well, I drove it in the rough off the tee and I tried to hack it up there but I still left myself a long shot, hit it onto the green and although I hit a good putt from 30 feet, it went about five feet past and I was pretty happy to hole the one coming back. But the greens are good, even how soft they are they are putting great.
Q. You have come back refreshed after a month at home?
PETER O'MALLEY:  Yes, I just went out and played and really am refreshed. I wasn't really thinking about anything really. The last time I played was the Nissan Irish Open. I just had a complete break and only played nine holes in the four weeks at home. That was at The Lakes and I got wet! Got me used to this week! I took in a few footie games and went to see Australia play the All Blacks as well so it was good. It was quite cold at home because I haven't been home for a while in the winter.
Q. Do you think the European guys concentrating on the Ryder Cup, might help you?
PETER O'MALLEY:  Well, our objectives are different -- my objectives in these three weeks is to play well enough to make in into the Amex. If I play well enough I'll get in that, if I don't, I'll have another couple of weeks at home. But I can play well this week and not get nervous. I played at Mount Juliet a couple of years ago and in Atlanta last year so a victory here would take care of that, it would be nice.
