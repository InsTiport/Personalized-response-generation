   PETER O'MALLEY:  I have been close to playing good golf for a while. This year I have just played badly on Thursdays. Fridays have been alright and then if I've made the cut I've played alright on the Sundays. I only missed three greens yesterday and I only missed one today, and I'm not missing the fairways. Seven under today and I was under no pressure really. I only had to get up and down once and the longest putt for par was probably three feet.   
  
  Q. Where was the up and down?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: At the 14th. It was when that wind and rain came through and I came up short because the wind was really strong. Everything else was pretty solid. Almost holed it at 12th for one. Hit a five iron to a foot.   
  
  Q. Did you miss any fairways today?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: I missed two yesterday in the first cut and hit every one today. That was handy because the rough is very penal.   
    
  Q. How much easier was it out there today?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: The wind was still there but the thing I have been doing well is not putting myself under pressure. I am hitting fairways and greens and I putted well also. If you play well you can score here, but if you hit off line you are going to rack up a number.   
  
  Q. I know your last win on this Tour was 2001. Have you won anywhere else since?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: I won the New Zealand PGA in 2005.   
  
  Q. So do you feel that you can still win?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: I have felt close to playing well for some time. Hopefully this is the turning point and kicks me off on a good note.   
  
  Q. And your name, O'Malley. Have you traced any Irish family members?   
 PETER O'MALLEY: We have never traced.
