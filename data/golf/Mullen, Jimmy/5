 Q.  You must be pleased to get off to a winning start?  
JIMMY MULLEN: It's always good to win no matter what but it's good for the guys playing to see we got a point on the board and give them a bit of encouragement.   
 Q.  What was the key for you in the match?  
JIMMY MULLEN: They birdied 14 to get it back to two. Ashley hit a good drive. I hit it to the right. He fatted it and then I fatted it and we ended up managing to get lucky with an eight footer for the half and Ashley holed it for the half.   
If we didn't hole that we would have lost two holes and been back to one up so that was big. We ended up winning 15 to go dormie so that was a big moment there.   
 Q.  Have you played with Ashley regularly?  
JIMMY MULLEN: We have played ten times this year foursomes so we know each other's games. I think it's great that we played together and good that Nige kept us together for this week
