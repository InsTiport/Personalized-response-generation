 Q.  Tell us about that match, it was highly eventful. There were only three halves in 15 holes.  
JIMMY MULLEN: I didn't actually realise that. Ashley saved me big time around 7 and 8 when I hit a couple of wild shots, so I owe him around there. It sort of turned around there where we got a lucky half on 7 and then won the next three holes to take charge of the game
