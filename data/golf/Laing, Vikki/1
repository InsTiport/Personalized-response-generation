 Q.   So how did the final round go for you?   
VIKKI LAING:   It was a little rough out there if I'm honest, but I probably would have taken the final, final result at the beginning of the week if you told me.   It was just a tough day today I'm afraid.  
   
 Q.   Started off well but the double bogey on nine‑‑  
VIKKI LAING:   Yeah, that one can creep up on you.   Didn't have a very good tee shot.   Tried to lay up, played a poor wedge shot and 3‑putts.   Landed on the green and just kept going.   And just a couple of poor shots coming back in.   
   
 Q.   But overall, your assessment of your week?  
VIKKI LAING:   As I say, I don't know where I am at the moment but somewhere near the Top‑10, I'd have taken that at the beginning of the week.   
   
 Q.   Is this your best kind of week for awhile?   
VIKKI LAING:   For a little bit.   I had a Top‑10 I think this year in Turkey, Top 15 in Amsterdam.   So a couple of good ones.   But it's nice to get in the Top‑10 again.
