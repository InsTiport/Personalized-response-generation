Q.   Just an assessment of today's play really?
VIKKI LAING:   I'm happy with the way it went today.   I had a few chances out there for birdie, hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens.   Just tried to stay patient and made some putts and made a nice eagle, too, which was nice, chipped in.   So that always helps.

Q.   This is a great position to be in going into the final round.   Do you feel anything's possible? 
VIKKI LAING:   Yeah, I'd have taken this‑‑ I'd have bit your harped if you had offered me this at the beginning of the week.   I'm delighted to be here and playing well and looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   What's made the difference so far this week?
VIKKI LAING:   I don't know, I'm just enjoying it really.   You know what it is, coming from Scotland and knowing I'm going back there; I'm just enjoying the weather and enjoying the course and playing well.
