Q. Once again, youâre in the hunt, but once again, Fish and Mulder are in the way.  What will it take for you to break through?
JEREMY ROENICK: Happy with how steady I was. To be able to be on the leaderboard near the top on day one gives you something to be motivated about.
To break through against the big boys, Fish and Mulder, I need to be more verbal.  I need to talk a bit more about how good they are, how proud I am to be playing with them, how I am in awe of them, and then hopefully, theyâll get a big head!
What I really need to do is find ways to make short putts.  I missed four or five putts from within 5 feet and an eagle from about 6 feet.  I also need to play within the new points system, where a birdie is worth just one more than a par.  I donât want to get overaggressive.
