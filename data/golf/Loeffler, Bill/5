 Q. Talk about your round today. How do you feel about it?
 BILL LOEFFLER: It's the worst round of golf I've ever played in my life. 

 Q. Has the course changed at all over the last couple days?
 BILL LOEFFLER: No, it's still real difficult. It's still windy. And it's just very disappointing. 

 Q. What do you have to do tomorrow?
 BILL LOEFFLER: I hope I show up. I hope I show up. I don't know, to tell you the truth. I'm at a loss. So we'll see. But that's golf. That's golf.
