  Q. When you started off on hole 14, it was a little rough for you. Do you want to explain what happened out there?  
 BILL LOEFFLER: 14?   
  
  Q. You were 2-over, I believe.   
 BILL LOEFFLER: You know, I ended up with a double bogey, but I hit probably out of the six shots, I probably hit four of them the way I wanted to. So I don't know what happened. I was very, I was a little concerned about me hitting good shots and then ending up with a double bogey.  
  
  Q. How were the greens for you today?  
 BILL LOEFFLER: I didn't putt well, but the greens are perfect. They're rolling great. And fast. And I didn't make anything, but it certainly wasn't because the greens were bad.   
  
  Q. So since you didn't putt well, is there a favorite club you had today?  
 BILL LOEFFLER: Wasn't my putter. It was my driver. I drove the ball well.
