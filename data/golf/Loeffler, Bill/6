 Q. Talk about your round today. 
 BILL LOEFFLER: Sure. I started off pretty poorly. I bogeyed 1, 2, and just starting to do a tumble. I was, I think I was, what, 6-over through 7. And I actually double bogeyed 7. And I managed a birdie on 8 to get it to 5 and then I just made a bunch of pars coming in until I bogeyed 13. 13 and 15 to go to 7. And then I birdied 16 and made two good pars on 17 and 18. I hung in there in tough conditions.

 Q. What effect did the cold and wind conditions have on your round?
 BILL LOEFFLER: It controlled everything. I don't think it was as cold as the morning guys, but it was still nippy. And then it was blustery winds. We couldn't figure out if we were downwind or upwind sometimes. You would be standing there and ready to hit your shot and all of a sudden the wind would totally switch. Even on putting sometimes it would, it really affected my putt on 14. 

 Q. It was tough?
 BILL LOEFFLER: It was tough.

 Q. What do you have to do tomorrow and in the upcoming days to stay in the hunt?
 BILL LOEFFLER: Well, I have just, just have to show a lot of patience, I think, and try to just control my emotions a little bit and understand that it's a, I mean there are going to be bogeys out here. It's not going to a birdiefest, so you just kind of have to stay in the moment I guess.
