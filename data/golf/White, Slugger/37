JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:   We have Slugger White.  Why don't we begin with Slugger kind of filling us in with what we're going to do for the rest of the week.
SLUGGER WHITE:  First thing is, that goodness for today.  We got lucky.  We had a pretty good system that was hanging out there about 25 miles that decided to go south and east.  That was really good.

Tomorrow we're going to play the second round, and assuming that we finish tomorrow's round, which is the second round, we will start at 7 a.m. on two tees on Sunday for the third and fourth round, and we will cut to the closest number of professionals to 60.  Third and fourth round, we will not repair between the third and fourth round.
Q.  Cut 60 tomorrow?
SLUGGER WHITE:  Assuming, yes, cut to the closest number.  There are no ties involved with this, so you know that.  The closest number of professionals to 60.  That's all assuming we finish tomorrow night.

If it splits the number, then we go to the highest number.  If it's 58 and 62, we go to 62.  55, 65, we go to 65.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  What time are we starting?
SLUGGER WHITE:  We'll start at 7 a.m.   I can tell you when we're going to start and I can tell you the last time for the fourth round will be around 2:30.  I can't tell you exactly what the first time will be until we know how many players make the cut.
Q.  (No microphone.)
SLUGGER WHITE:  All day.
Q.  (No microphone.)
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Still pay the guys at 70, but they just won't participate in the last.  They will not participate in the 36 hole march.
Q.  (No microphone.)
SLUGGER WHITE:  Correct.
Q.  Why would you not make a cut after the third round?
SLUGGER WHITE:  We don't have time.  There's no time.  Let's just say the leader shot 80, we got to wait for him to finish before we start the fourth round.  You can't do it.  Doesn't work.

Everything clear as mud?
Q.  (No microphone.)
SLUGGER WHITE:  I'm sure they will.  I'm sure they will, yeah.  It's not going to be easy.  It's usually about an 11 , 12 hour day.  It's a long day, believe me.
Q.  What if we don't finish tomorrow's round?
SLUGGER WHITE:  I'm not going    there's too many other variables.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  He'll come back and see us (laughter).
SLUGGER WHITE:  I'll be back tomorrow night.

I can honestly say, we have a really good forecast for Sunday, and we've got a very good forecast for tomorrow.  That's kind of what we're looking at.  That's had lot to do with the determination of what we're going to do.
Q.  (No microphone.)
SLUGGER WHITE:  I think really good is much better.  It's above okay.  We're looking at maybe a 10% chance tomorrow and hardly any chance at all on Sunday.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Slugger.
SLUGGER WHITE:  My pleasure.
