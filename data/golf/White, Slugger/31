 Q. Slugger, the decision has been made. Tell us what went into it. 
 SLUGGER WHITE: Well, we've got a golf course that's absolutely under water. I mean, there's no way that -- they've got 16 miles of drain out there, and it's just -- I haven't seen anything quite this bad in a long time.

 Q. The good news is the forecast looks great for the next three days, and we've got zoysia fairways, which we all know, the players know, it's a great surface to play off of if it's going to be wet. 
 SLUGGER WHITE: No question about it. It's a little spongy right now on the tees, and hopefully this next 20 hours of drying, hopefully Gustav gets out of here in the next hour and a half or so and we can get some drying started.

 Q. What is our actual plan for the weekend right now as we move forward?
 SLUGGER WHITE: The tee times, it will be first-round tee times tomorrow on Friday. We're going to play 36 on Saturday, which is a little unusual. We're going to re-pair after tomorrow's round according to score. There will be no re-pairing on Saturday, you just keep going like a big merry-go-round, and hopefully in a perfect world we can get back on try Saturday evening and play pairs on Sunday on one tee.

 Q. With 69 players and a good forecast, it looks like we should, God-willing and weather-willing. 
 SLUGGER WHITE: That's exactly right.
