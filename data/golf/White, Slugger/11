 Q.   It was tough to start, but we got some pretty big gusts out there.  
SLUGGER WHITE:   We did, and it was‑‑ I mean, we started, it was on the edge, yes, it was on the edge, and you hope for the best and it just didn't happen.   Then we got‑‑ you know, we had gusts in the high 30s when we were starting and then when we stopped, they were 48 miles an hour.   
It's difficult walking out there, and hitting golf shots, and it's just one of those things.  
   
 Q.   It's tough to describe how hard it's blowing, I'm yelling into my mic trying to just get a sentence out and breathe, let alone hit a golf shot.   What's the official situation right now?   Are we just in a holding pattern right now?  
SLUGGER WHITE:   We are in a hold right now.   I'm going to go up and assess what we are looking at with our weather and probably get back to these guys as quickly as I can.
