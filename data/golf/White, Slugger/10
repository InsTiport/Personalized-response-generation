  SLUGGER WHITE:   So play 36 holes tomorrow and finish on Tuesday morning, 54 holes.   
   
 Q.   Forecast?   
SLUGGER WHITE:   Forecast is a little bit better.   We have got a little bit‑‑ we have got about a five‑mile‑an‑hour decrease in velocity.   We have got wind blowing out there about 48 miles an hour right now.   We are trying to‑‑ it would be sustained tomorrow for probably 20, 25, gusting into the high 30s.   
Actually when we started, we were about 25 today, and for about 30 to 45 minutes, we were okay, but then just the bottom fell out.   
   
 Q.   How about a little fertilizer and water on the greens and hopefully we can get them to stop?  
SLUGGER WHITE:   We thought we were going to be okay with the greens and we're going to do the same thing we did last night.   No mowing today and no rolling and just cut them down or just cut them tonight and let them grow.
