  Q. Slugger, a fairly long delay begun by lightning, but then continued by a whole lot of rain. How much did we get and what was involved in having to get the course ready again?  
 SLUGGER WHITE: We measured with our Meteorologix was about 1.7. I think they said they had a little bit more in the golf shop, but right around there.   
 Rained a lot, Bob. There was a lot of prep going on. There was a lot of bunker damage.   
 It's still a little wet out there, but it's starting to drain a little bit. My hat's off to the grounds crew. They did a great job.   
  
  Q. And so really bunkers was the only thing that had to have a lot of work done on it once the rain stopped?  
 SLUGGER WHITE: Well, we had a couple places. We had a place at 7, getting from 7 green to 8 tee and we had a problem at 14 to 15. But other than that, we feel like that will subside as time goes on, so that's what we're looking for right now.   
  
  Q. With the amount of daylight left and what's expected in, how close can you get to getting close to getting back on schedule?  
 SLUGGER WHITE: I think sunset is at 8:19 tonight. So we can play up to pretty much that area, 8:00, maybe a little bit after, depends on if we get good luck with some sunlight and get rid of some clouds.   
 And then hopefully we can get better than nine holes played and start tomorrow morning and get rolling, and obviously we're trying to get back on track for television. And we have a chance of getting close, but we might be a half hour past time tomorrow.   
  
  Q. That's not bad.   
 SLUGGER WHITE: No. It's pretty good for what we had here.   
  
  Q. Thanks, Larry.   
 SLUGGER WHITE: You bet, Bob.
