  Q. If you would just explain how this came about, the process, what the issue was, and the rule?  
 SLUGGER WHITE: I got word of this last night, probably about 7:30, something like that, and I just couldn't do anything at that point in time. So this morning, I came in, I looked at the tape, the GOLF CHANNEL let me look at the tape and it was pretty obvious what happened.   
 Unfortunately Camilo gets the swap under the scoring rule, but he signed for an incorrect scorecard for a score lower than he actually made. And I went to him before I made any formal announcement, and he said he'd like to see it just to learn. I told him what happened. He could not have been bigger. I mean, bigger -- he said it's one of those things. Obviously he wasn't trying to do anything. He just didn't know. And that's where we went.  
  
  Q. What exactly was the infraction?   
 SLUGGER WHITE: He had chipped the ball up the hill, I guess the first time, on 15, and it got to the top of the hill and as it's rolling back where the divot was and the loose impediment. It's basically just under the rule, under 23, under loose impediment.   
 Rocco was going to be first out, and so we moved; it was only 30 minutes difference. We talked to Rocco about it and he was very amenable and went up there, 30 minutes later. He's going to play in a pair with Ernie Els.
