   SLUGGER WHITE: There's a lot of decisions still to be made. It's all up to Irene, and she's not happy right now. Today will be big for us if we get, you know, the last group making the turn or whatever. 

 Q. The projected forecast is for the rain and the wind to hit late Saturday and all the way into Sunday. Major League Baseball, we checked with them, the NFL, they have checked with them and they have not done anything as far as their schedules. You told me yesterday you were going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to decide what you are going to do this week here at The Barclays. Why wait that long for the PGA TOUR?
 SLUGGER WHITE: I just think that's the best way to go. This thing could wobble and do a lot of different things. I think to jump out there ahead of everything, I don't think that's the right way to go and I think that everyone involved would agree.

 Q. Whenever we have a wedge forecast we hear the dreaded Monday finish we could have a Tuesday finish. Take us through the scenarios if there is no play on Sunday for how it would finish on Monday or perhaps even Tuesday?
 SLUGGER WHITE: That comes to what our regulations say. We don't go until Tuesday unless we get half the field finished on Monday. So if we are not playing Monday then the Commissioner gets involved with the regulations. 
 So he's the only one that can overturn the regulation, and I'd be fast-forward to him.
