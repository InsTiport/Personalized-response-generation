  MARK STEVENS:   Just kind of talk about the decision and what you saw out there.  
SLUGGER WHITE:   Well, I haven't really seen anything out there just jet, Mark.   I'm probably going to go out there in a few minutes.     
Well, obviously we had some wind gusts up to 50, 55 miles an hour.   We've got three and a half to five inches of rainfall out there.   We've got structures down.   We've got pretty much probably a mess.   The bunkers, I'm sure are an absolute mess.   
And we're going to try to resume tomorrow morning at 7:00.   If we are lucky enough to do that and keep playing, we will not re‑pair.   If we don't get started at 7:00, then we will re‑pair for the fourth round and then play as long as we can right up to dark and then finish on Monday morning.
