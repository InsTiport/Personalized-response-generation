 Q.  Tough to stay patient but it looked like you did and you're still in a good position. 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  It was so bad.  It was a real struggle today and to hang in there, I could have gone low today and especially out here, you never know what's going to happen. 
 So that was probably the best out of the three to be honest.  I kept myself in it and could have played myself out of it. 

 Q.  How scary is it to stand up on the tee sometimes and go:  Well, I want to play left-to-right but I don't know where it's going to go? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Like on 17, I said to Robert, what do you hit, five; I felt like I want to hit three.  Just I'm glad I got in at a number and I'm only one shot back.  So in that respect, need to go work on a few things. 

 Q.  What will you work on? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Finding the clubface. (Laughing) 
 I felt like I shot 80 today.  It's just one of those days where I was swinging it not great.  I started off okay, but a couple of bad shots, wasn't making anything on the greens, and all of a sudden starting hitting it left and right, and left and then left again.  And I just had to hang on for dear life coming in, and hanging on for dear life in the Bear Trap is the best thing in the world. 
 But overall, I'm really happy I'm only one shot off the lead and have a chance to win. 

 Q.  Just a case of nerves? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  No.  I think I've struggled and for a couple days I managed to get away with it.  Overall that's what I've been trying to get rid of, what I did today.  And I did it for two days, so I think it's possible to keep it going.
