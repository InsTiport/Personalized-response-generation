 Q. 4-under par for the first six holes of the day. Talk about that fast start. 
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, I got off to a fast start this morning, and the greens had a little bit of moisture in them and I was able to spin the ball and took advantage of it early. The wind has picked up a little bit now and it's going to play a little more tricky but there's some birdies to be had out there today, and I took advantage of it.
 Obviously I was a little disappointed with the finish coming in that I wasn't able to keep it going, but overall 3-under first round, I'll take it.

 Q. Give us a sense of the pin positions out there. 
 BRIAN DAVIS: Normally we get used to playing certain pin positions certain days, but they mixed a few up. There's some easier pins today than normal, but as you can see from the scoring, there are birdies and eagles out there. I would say that anybody that shoots 5-, 6-under par is going to be somewhere around the lead at the end of the day.

 Q. Is this a course that suits your game? 
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, I mean, any course suits you when you're playing well, no matter where you play. I do love this course in that most TPCs we play you've got to bomb it. This TPC you've got to bomb it but you've also got to shape the ball right to left, left to right, and obviously that's my game.

 Q. Talk about your year. Pretty consistent?
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, season started off slow. The last couple months have been getting better. I've had a lot of top-30 finishes, and it's been pretty good golf out here. Just need to make a few more putts, and that's probably the difference. Last week I finished badly, so I'm looking to make that right this week.
