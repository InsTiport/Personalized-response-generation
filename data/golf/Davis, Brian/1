  BRIAN DAVIS: It wasn't bad.  It's not like it was horrific, but when you're not used to playing in a rain jacket or carrying an umbrella all the time, it changes a little bit.  But after that it turned out pretty nice.  Obviously I know how hot it can get here this time of year, so it's actually really nice now.   Q.  How crucial was that last putt on 18 to end your day?  BRIAN DAVIS: To be honest the one on 17 was bigger.  I played great all the way around.  I missed a bunch of putts to keep going low.  A little bit of frustration there, but holed a good putt on 17 and obviously carried that momentum into 18 and obviously made a tricky putt down the hill.  Delighted; my form has been not great lately, so today was a nice way to start, and hopefully the hard work is paying off.   Q.  Talk about the eagle on 1.  BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, hit a good tee shot down the left side, because obviously the pin is front right, left myself a perfect angle, easy 8-iron, and just hit a great shot, and obviously, as I said, I didn't see it, but I pitched on my number, and at the end of the day when it goes in, it's luck, but I executed a good shot and obviously delighted.   Q.  Did you hear the roar?  BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, my playing partner.  We were lucky there was marshals out there at that time, and they were too busy holding their umbrellas and trying to keep themselves warm.  Just one of those things, it was a great way to start, and we did have a bit of a chuckle about it.
