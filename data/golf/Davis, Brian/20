   BRIAN DAVIS: Delighted and I played solid today. Anytime you can get round this course in under par you are going to be pleased. It will probably firm up so very pleased today. I played here last time the PGA was here in 2004 so had a rough idea what was in store before the practice round. You have to know where to hit it but number one is that you have to hit it in play. Hit out of play you are going to struggle. 

 Q. How are you feeling about the year?
 BRIAN DAVIS: It's been a weird year. In terms of money and world rankings it is my best year but I have missed more cuts this year. It is unusual for me. We decided this year not to play eight or ten in a row and play four and then a week off and then another four so that has altered things a little. I am just battling back and looking forward to this week.
