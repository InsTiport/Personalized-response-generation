Q.   We talked earlier in the week, you knew your status and you were able to accomplish your goal and move on to Chicago.   The feeling you have right now and succeeding in that?
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, it's good to know.   I was always behind the leaders, pretty much going down into the back nine.   I felt if I could finish strong, maybe get top five, top three, maybe move on. 
But overall the week coming in I had four or five missed cuts.   A lot to take to Chicago.
