  BRIAN DAVIS:   I didn't have control of the swing today, really struggling.   Delighted at 3-under, still in the golf tournament the way I played.

Q.   Do you take that, this is your bad round, got 69.   Do you feel like you get back to what you had the first few days?
BRIAN DAVIS:   69 is a good score.   I'm talking about the shots.   If I want to improve on that coming down the stretch tomorrow, I've got to sort it out.   Delighted I'm in there, considering how badly I struck the ball.

Q.   Do you like your chances tomorrow?   What's it going to take?
BRIAN DAVIS:   You never know.   You can get the wind or the hardest golf course in the world.   I'm happy to still be where I am, considering I didn't have my A or B game today.   I'm still in it.
