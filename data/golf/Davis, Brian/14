Q.   What was the best thing about your game today?
BRIAN DAVIS:   I absolutely hit it awful tee to green.   It was just terrible.   I got away with everything.   I chipped and putted like hell today, and things go your way.   Things like that can make a difference.   Obviously we'll go to the range this afternoon and try and iron out a few flaws in our swing, but obviously delighted to get in at 66 and obviously build on that momentum. 

Q.   The course is in such great shape so when you do miss a green you usually have a terrific lie and you have a good short game, so you took advantage, didn't you?
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, I did.   I chipped in once, and I had three or four chips that lipped out, chipped it close.   So it is pretty easy to chip.   But obviously if you wrong side yourself, it's still tough.   But the course was there this morning, obviously slightly softer greens and what have you.   It'll be tougher tomorrow afternoon. 

Q.   A long way to go, but what a good start. 
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, as you said, I've played a lot of good golf the last couple of months, and today was probably the worst round I've played in those two months, so that's just the way it goes sometimes.   You've just got to try and hang in there and just hang around for the weekend.
