 Q.  What were you working on the putting green? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Anything and everything.  You know, everybody is talking about the greens.  You've got to get a good roll on these greens at the moment. 

 Q.  Where does that stand in the good rounds you've played in America since you came? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  I would say in general one of my best rounds.  I had a good week at Honda, last week at Tampa I was doing really well, 6-over the last six, albeit in that wind, so kicked in the teeth a bit. 
 Yesterday was disappointing, 38 putts, went back and tried to find something. 

 Q.  What did you find? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Found something.  You know, I played good today.  I played good.  And just I hit it close quite a lot of times, and again, it's one of them, I left myself 4-footers but underneath the whole and that makes such a difference. 
 Overall, I've played very well, and you only hit probably a couple loose shots.  And I made a couple bogeys which you can do out here, so demanding. 

 Q.  Still working with Gary Evans? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Yeah, he came out before Phoenix when I missed cut, so that was good.  Then he came out in Tampa, I missed the cut.  He's been helping me a bit with my swing.  Last year I had a lot of injuries, so tough year, but fingers crossed, this will be a better year. 

 Q.  Off the course are things well? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Yeah, second baby on the way and it's a girl, so my wife's over the moon. 

 Q.  You said you were not going to have another baby until you won a major. 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Well, speak to the boss, you know how it works.
