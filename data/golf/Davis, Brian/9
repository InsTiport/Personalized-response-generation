Q.   Brian, great start for you on a tough day.   You've got to be pleased?
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, I am.   It was freezing cold this morning.   I was playing in a wet suit and wool hat, and it was tough.   It's warmed up now.   But the wind is tricky and this golf course is a lot of trouble left and right.   So you've got to keep the ball in play. 

Q.   You're starting to play well.   Your game is coming around; isn't it? 
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, I played well last week.   Showed a few signs in Tampa, Bay Hill and Tavistock.   I saw a few glimpses of it which hadn't been there.   But I'm pleased; I'm enjoying it.   I've got a good record in Texas for some reason.   Maybe I should move here.

Q.   I was talking about your preâ€‘putt routine, trying to describe it.   Because you stand straight up, then you bend down gradually and putt.   Is that something you've been doing for a while? 
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, I've probably been doing it for about three years now.   It's just posture.   I have a problem getting hunched over.   I find if I set my posture, all I've got to do is swing the putter. 
It's nothing I've done different through the last few years, but I'm being a little bit more diligent with it right now.

Q.   Makes me want to stretch my back, whenever I see you do that. 
BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, well, I'm getting old, so I have to make sure I stay up tall.
