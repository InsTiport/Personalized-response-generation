  Q.  Second straight 68.  4-under for the tournament.  Let's talk a little bit about your day today.   
 BRIAN DAVIS:  I got off to a good start, cruising along, hitting greens, making pars, you know, trying to hit it pretty good.  Then I mis-clubbed on 13, hit it long and 3-putted and I was a bit pissed at myself and I hit a terrible shot at the par 3 in the water and made double.  I went back to the spot.  It was pretty tough but, you know, I kind of hung in there and holed the next putt.   
 I hit a great shot on the par 5 to about four feet and missed it for eagle.  Again, that sort of kicked me down again.  And then I hit two great shots at last and, you know, I'm very happy with 4-under and looking forward to tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Looks like you're going to be maybe four, five shots back.  What type of mindset are you going to take into it?   
 BRIAN DAVIS:  If Adam plays well and shoots a couple under, it's very hard to shoot 64 out here.  If he shoots, one, two over, it gives us all a chance.  Really, we can be looking Top-5, Top-4, Top-3 and if Adam gets off to a rocky start -- if you can get off to a quick start, we'll put a bit of pressure on him.
