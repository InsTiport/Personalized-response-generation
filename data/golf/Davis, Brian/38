Q. Great start -- different conditions than the past few weeks though?

BRIAN DAVIS: I'm cold! I have been wearing my shorts for the last six weeks so it was a bit of a shock coming over but it's great. I love playing over the three courses and it's good fun. I missed a few putts coming in, but I'll take four under round Carnoustie any day of the week. If the weather's bad here, it can be a nightmare.
Q. When was the last time you were in Europe?

BRIAN DAVIS: Scandinavian Masters, then I went back to America.
Q. Things seem to be going well for you over there?

BRIAN DAVIS: It's been great, but bit hectic at the moment because we are having another baby, which is due in seven weeks and I am trying to move into a new house and all of the things that go with it but I am really happy.
