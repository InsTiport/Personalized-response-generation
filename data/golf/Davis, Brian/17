 Q. 1-under, the verdict from the first round?
 BRIAN DAVIS: You know, I'm happy. We all know the last four holes you can run up double bogeys in a heartbeat. No, I'm happy. My form has been decent, I just haven't been quite finishing it off.

 Q. We saw some big scores from some people. Do you feel this course is playable?
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, I do. This morning there was a little bit of moisture in the greens, so you could go at some of the flags, and there were some birdies to be had. Obviously Stricker is about 8-under, so you can make some birdies out there. 
 But I think as the week goes on, this golf course is definitely going to get a lot tougher.
