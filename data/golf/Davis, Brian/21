 Q. If you want to start off talk about the course conditions and how you played real quick. 
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, played great today. And you know, this is probably one of the best conditioned courses we're going to see all year. The greens are running pure, fairways were awesome. 
 Softened up a little bit. Obviously they had a couple of downfalls the last couple days, which is a shame, because it's starting to firm up. 
 Weather is supposed to be good this week, so if it does firm up by Sunday, it could be a good-looking golf course.

 Q. And your score, you had a great score today, the wind started to pop up. What do you think --
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah, no, the thing is the greens are soft. Once it firms up, it's a different story. But hey, you know, as you said, to get off to a good start is great.

 Q. Is there anything different you're doing this week? You know, you've been through that rough period. 
 BRIAN DAVIS: Yeah. Just changed my putter. Same company, just different look. And just changed back to my old putter. And just a few little things, just trying to mix it up and get my feeling back. Makes you feel good.

 Q. Okay. Thanks, Brian.
