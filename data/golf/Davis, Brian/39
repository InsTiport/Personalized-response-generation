Q.  You began the day 1 over, two early bogeys, the leader had just about teed off and he was at minus eight and this means you were 11 shots back right now as you stand here you trail by three.  That's a pretty good move?
BRIAN DAVIS:  Yeah, it was, I started off, I felt really good on the range and I felt really good on the putting green and started for two bogeys and got a bit fired up.  I made an unbelievable up and down on No. 3 for par, otherwise it would have been three in a row.  Just got on a run, started hitting good and making a few putts.  Everything was in place today and obviously I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Q.  Talk about how you ended the day with a nifty, according to your caddie, 40 footer on the last for birdie?
BRIAN DAVIS:  15, the par 5, I had a great chance for 5 and missed it.

Center of the fairway on 16 with a sand iron and made par, and missed a 10 footer on 17 for birdie.  It overall it evens itself out as they say.
