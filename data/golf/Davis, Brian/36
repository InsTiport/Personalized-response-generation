 Q.  You shoot what, 66 and looks like you're standing still out there.  It's a great day for you, right? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Yeah, it is for me.  I've had a tough time.  Woody was playing behind me.  I kept hearing cheers so I knew somebody was doing so good.  He birdied the 2nd and pitched in for eagle on the 3rd behind us.  I knew someone was going to make a charge, I just didn't expect it was to be that much. 

 Q.  Talk about the course today.  Birdies to be had and guys were getting them. 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Wind wasn't up.  Slightly different direction again.  Pins were pretty generous because it's soft and a bit firmer.  There were scores out there.  This course is one of those things, if you're slightly off you will pay the price. 

 Q.  Talk about your practice rounds. 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  I won twice in Europe and both of those wins I only played 9 holes practice.  One, because it was too hot; two, I had been out the night before.  Then I didn't have a practice round at all this week.  I got nice in contention.  I thought maybe this is my moment.  Maybe I shouldn't see a golf course. 
 I came in this week and obviously golf took a backstage.  I think I had a lot to do with my mental attitude.  I struggled the last couple of years, lot of things going on.  Maybe let them affect me somewhat.  Today it came out and did fine. 

 Q.  How is everybody? 
 BRIAN DAVIS:  Everybody is fine.  Everybody is back home.  I'm not in the U.S. Open which is a shame.  In some respects it might be a good thing, take a break and get ready for the rest of the season.
