 Q. Can you just talk a little bit about your round today, what you felt was working for you?
 BRIAN DAVIS: I played very well today. I hit a lot of good shots, three-putted 17 for par, which was disappointing. But apart from that, it was a really good day. It was tricky out there, the wind picked up and the greens got a bit chewed up, so it was a good round. I'm very happy.

 Q. With the possible weather that's coming in, possible rain tonight, maybe tomorrow, how do you think that will affect the course?
 BRIAN DAVIS: Well, the course started to firm up on the back nine. The ball started to release. The first round and a half the ball was just screwing back with everything. And now the ball is actually releasing. So it's going to be a completely different golf course. 
 As you say, the weather is coming. You just don't know what to expect. I mean, they're saying it could go into tomorrow, as well, so we might be stuck not teeing off on time. 
 It's going to be hit-and-miss with the weather, but this course is always a shootout, so you're going to have to go low on the weekend.

 Q. With it being a shootout like that, what do you think it's going to take tomorrow to get it done?
 BRIAN DAVIS: Just depends on the weather. If we get storms coming through and all of a sudden there's a 30-mile-an-hour wind, then everything changes. Unfortunately we've just got to see what the weather is going to throw at us over the weekend.
