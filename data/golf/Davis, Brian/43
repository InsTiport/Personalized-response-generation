Q.  You had the best round of the day.

BRIAN DAVIS:  Yeah, I was always hoping that the guys wouldn't run away, because if I shot 65, I might have a chance but they obviously put numbers on the board and got ahead, so that's a shame.


Q.  Is that your lowest round at Valderrama?

BRIAN DAVIS:   At Valderrama, yeah.


Q.  And that includes two bogeys in the first few holes.

BRIAN DAVIS:   Yeah, just one of those days.  I didn't have to hole putts.  I hit it stiff.  I think every birdie barring one, on the fifth that I holed from 12 feet, apart from that, every one was within sort of two or three feet. 


Q.  Overall it's a nice way to end the season; have you got any more coming up? 

BRIAN DAVIS:   Seve. 


Q.  Individually?

BRIAN DAVIS:   No, I'm done. 


Q.  And how would you encapsulate the year?

BRIAN DAVIS:   Well, you say it's disappointing because you haven't won, like when they said to Harrington, have you ever finished second.  I've achieved pretty much all of the other goals I've set myself this year:  Make the Seve, make some majors and maybe one or two world events, all of those sorts of things and that's happened.  This is just a bonus.  I can't wait till next year.
