BRIAN DAVIS:  Great to have the course record at the Home of Golf. Lee Westwood took away my record of 65 at Kingsbarns yesterday so it's nice to get this one today. I saw him hole that second shot for an albatross. I had the record there with 65. I just wanted to shoot as low as I could and just caught fire. If ever there was a day to break 60 this was it if you were riding your luck. I didn't really think about it at the time but I could have birdied eight and nine. Pity I didn't go lower. I didn't know that Curtis Strange had the record for the course before it was lengthened with a 62. It's nice to match that but it would have been lovely to be the first person to shoot 61 at St Andrews.
I'm pleased because it consolidates my place next week in the WGC American Express Championship and gets me a few Ryder Cup points. The course was there to be had with no wind and nine and sunny. I'm ecstatic with that score. I am now looking forward to next week in Atlanta. I've been struggling lately to finish the job so that was good.
