  ROD PAMPLING:   Very solid round of golf today.   Had a good string going, held on all the way towards the end.   It was nice. 

Q.   You hit 11 fairways and only 23 putts. 
ROD PAMPLING:   Yeah, the 23 putts is good.   Doesn't happen too often, so I'll take it whenever I can get it.

Q.   You've been patient? 
ROD PAMPLING:   Not really.   No, I haven't.   That's where I kind of have to assess things.   After Memphis, I took stock of what I was doing.   I wasn't at the Open, so it was good to sit back and do some work and focus on what I need to do on how to relax more.

Q.   You're such a veteran.   You know there is a lot of golf to be played?
ROD PAMPLING:   Yes, absolutely.   I've only had two events in a row once this year.   I'm looking forward to after AT&T National.   I get a good run from there on, so I'm looking forward to a good stretch there. 

Q.   The course in good condition? 
ROD PAMPLING:   Yep, the course is in great conditions.   Had the big shower on Tuesday, but hopefully we won't get anymore and the course will keep drying out.   It's getting back to its usual great conditions.
