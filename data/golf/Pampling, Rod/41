 Q.  How was it playing? 
 ROD PAMPLING:  It's still tough.  I played really well the last two days, so it's nice when you're driving well, hitting the fairways. 
 Yeah, it's still extremely tough and I've been hitting it well.  It certainly makes it feel a little bit easier than it was actually. 

 Q.  You have to be happy with your position going into the weekend? 
 ROD PAMPLING:  Yeah, I haven't had a position like this this year.  I'm looking forward to the weekend and see what we come up with. 

 Q.  3 and 18 played as two of the toughest holes on TOUR yesterday, was it the length or the water? 
 ROD PAMPLING:  I guess the 30-mile-an-hour wind straight at you makes it hard, and water everywhere.  Yeah, they are two tough holes and obviously the wind straight into you makes it extremely hard.  That's the reasons why they are hard holes. 

 Q.  Very good score -- 
 ROD PAMPLING:  Basically just been working hard on the swing, trying to work out what's going on. 
 I think it's finally at a stage where I can trust what I'm doing now and not guessing what's going on out there, and obviously hitting well.  The confidence is up again and now just need to get those putts to go in a bit more. 

 Q.  (Wish the good play had come sooner)? 
 ROD PAMPLING:  Just happy to be here this week.  If I timed it right it would have been January 1.  But it's a little bit slow.
