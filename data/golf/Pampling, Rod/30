  Q.  Tough way to go out, but you went down fighting?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Yeah, you know, really the last hole was the only disappointing hole of the day.  I almost had a chance to win on 18.  You've got to hit the putt firm and unfortunately it hovered over the hole and didn't go in.   
 We had a lot of chances.  I nearly made it on 1, 3 and 15 out there again.  You know what, that's unfortunate.  That's golf.  And it was just the one mistake on the last which obviously Vijay took advantage of.   
  
  Q.  What happened there on the last?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  I hit driver in the left rough off the tee on 17.  We were both down there.  It's kind of -- I guess it was one of the worst lies in the rough you have, and there's not many bad ones out here.  I went to hit it out and had to go down in after it and somehow I got right underneath it and it kind of came out and left.  It was one of those one-in-a-million shots and it went into the cactus and I had to take an unplayable.  And Vijay still made a good solid par and shut the door.   
  
  Q.  Your putt on 18, it just started on the right lip --   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Well, that's the trouble.  It was a breaking putt and if you hit it a little bit softer it could miss left.  I hit a good putt.  I aimed exactly there and hit the putt the way I wanted.  It only needed a millimeter to the left and it's done.  The trap shot could have gone in, as well.  But that's the way it goes.  The last hole was the only disappointing one.   
  
  Q.  Are you proud of the way your game held up this week?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Yeah, it was fine.  I've been playing really solid golf over a year now and no results; the putter has been really bad.  But that was great.  We hit a lot of great putts this week.  So forwards now.
