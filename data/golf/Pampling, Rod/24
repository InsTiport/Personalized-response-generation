 Q. Going into the rest of the week; is there anything you need to work on in particular?
 ROD PAMPLING: No, just keep doing what I've been doing. I've been working hard just to hit the ball straight I guess. It worked today, so we'll keep practicing that. 

 Q. You have three weeks to get into Augusta; how important is it to you?
 ROD PAMPLING: Obviously you want to play all of the majors and it's the only one an Australian has not won yet and I enjoy that golf course. It would be nice to win Augusta. If you are not there, you can't do it. So it's obviously very important to get into the tournament.

 Q. So a big motivation for these three weeks for you?
 ROD PAMPLING: Absolutely.

 Q. Did you see today, did you feel it coming or did it just sort of happen?
 ROD PAMPLING: I didn't expect -- no, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't expect 6-under. I know it was getting better but it just really depended on how I putted. If you putt good, you can get something out of it, and thankfully, we made some nice putts and sort of found a bit of rhythm out there and we hit some good shots and made some putts. All of a sudden, it was 6-under.

 Q. Is it better for you to be on this side of the country or do you like the West Coast better? 
 ROD PAMPLING: I guess I won in Castle Pines and Bay Hill, so I guess it doesn't really matter too much. 
 No, it doesn't bother me which part of the country. As long as it's warm. 

 Q. Putting-wise?
 ROD PAMPLING: If you're putting good, you can make it anywhere. So just work hard on the putting and keep the stroke nice and solid and hopefully they will keep going in.
