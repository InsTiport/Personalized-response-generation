Q.   Same position basically that you were yesterday, right around the lead, but you've got to feel good about getting how many holes under your belt today?
ROD PAMPLING:  Well, we're back in the same spot we finished yesterday, on the 13th fairway.
Q.   Talk about the day today, obviously a wet one and the golf course is playing longer.
ROD PAMPLING:  It's playing a little bit longer.  Once the rain started we were taken straight off, but it's still playing pretty good.  Obviously this last bit put it under water.

I just had a good start on the front nine, and once we get back out here tomorrow, I want to build on it tomorrow.
Q.   Getting a win at The International obviously helped your confidence.  Generally talk about your play at the PGA.
ROD PAMPLING:  Definitely it gave me confidence.  It's building from there.  You know, I played well at the PGA for three days, so my game feels good and I'm making some nice putts, so that's what's keeping me up there, making longer putts than I normally do, and hopefully we'll keep rolling it good and it'll be good for Sunday.
