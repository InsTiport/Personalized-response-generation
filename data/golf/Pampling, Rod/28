  Q. How are you feeling about your game coming into this tournament?  
 ROD PAMPLING: I've been hitting it fine. I had a great putting week at Colonial, and next couple just kind of went off a little bit.   
 Wish I would have made some more today and hopefully I will continue making them and have a chance for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What got you in trouble on the last two holes?   
 ROD PAMPLING: I 3-putted the 8th hole. Just a little bit quicker than I thought. It was an uphill putt and snuck by and I didn't hit a good next putt.   
 Hit it in the bunker on 9. You're pretty handcuffed in those bunkers. I nearly chipped it in, so just go out tomorrow and see what I can do.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like tomorrow that you have another one of those in your bag?  
 ROD PAMPLING: Yeah, it's not like this is a course where you go out and shoot 10- or 11-under and the next day you really don't do anything. I still think there's some left and hopefully go out and get off to a good start and shoot 6- or 7-under again tomorrow, who knows.
