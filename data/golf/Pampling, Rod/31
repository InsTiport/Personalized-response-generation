  Q.  Pretty decisive victory today?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Yeah, I just felt comfortable out there.  I don't think Nic was quite on his game.  I don't think he's feeling the best.  He was sick last week.  But the game was good.  We made a lot of nice birdies when we had the chance, we did.  We were fortunate to get around with a good win.   
  
  Q.  Getting in the third round of this tournament is always a pretty good feeling.  How do you feel about that?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Yeah, I'm feeling really well out there.  I've got some nice putts going on the greens.  I've got the speed pretty solid.  I'm not giving myself any four- or five-footers, so it feels good.   
  
  Q.  Any key turns in the match?  I know every hole the momentum switches in match play.  Any key shots you hit or holes that you had?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  Not really.  I made a good par on No. 1 to get off to a good start.  And then Nic didn't hit a good shot on No. 2.  So that helped me go 2-up after two.  I just played nice through there.  As I said, the birdie holes, I birdied them.  And sometimes Nic did and other times he missed a putt.  So it ended up being a nice round.
