  Q. Rod, getting off to a hot stat, you don't want to be behind the 8-ball all week long?  
 ROD PAMPLING: No, it's a tough course to chase on. But this year, it will be interesting the scores this year, I think there's a bit more rough than we have ever had. I had a couple out there that were pretty bad lies.   
 Still, you've got to drive it a lot better. It will be hard but I'm happy for a quick start which is one thing I don't think I've ever had around here, which is nice.   
  
  Q. Were you finding that the ball was still going a little shorter? Usually you get a lot of chase in the fairways and this week seems like it's not happening right now?  
 ROD PAMPLING: No, I didn't think it was playing long. It was decent. I think the fairways are firming up, so obviously the guys this afternoon are going to be hitting a few really long tee balls I would imagine, but I didn't think it was playing too long out there.   
  
  Q. When it starts pushing 100 degrees, the ball will go pretty far?  
 ROD PAMPLING: Yeah, we had one -- hit 9-iron and it went, like 2 1/2 clubs further than it should have. It was quite amazing, that one.   
  
  Q. You were not playing for 2 1/2 clubs?  
 ROD PAMPLING: No, just a regular shot. I had a long chip back.
