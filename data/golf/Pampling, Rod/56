Q.   5 under par for the tournament.  Talk about your round today.
ROD PAMPLING:  I played nicely early.  I actually didn't make enough putts early on, and then just coming in, I didn't really hit the ball great.  We just got around, made pars, and it kept us in for tomorrow.
Q.   Did it dry out much as the round went on?
ROD PAMPLING:  Definitely conditions got a lot better.  The course is starting to dry out a little bit more, and you've got to be a little bit more careful where you go, but it's still a bit wet out there, which is to be expected.
Q.   You're hanging right in there.  How do you feel about your position?
ROD PAMPLING:  Oh, okay.  I didn't play great the back nine.  I kept myself in there.  I didn't make any bogeys, so it gives me a chance for tomorrow.  It'll have to be a pretty good score, but at least we're still there.
Q.   Was today all about trying to stay in position?
ROD PAMPLING:  If you're playing great, but the way I played, it was just trying to make pars.  It wasn't quite as good as it was the front nine.  However you play is however you're going to handle your round.
