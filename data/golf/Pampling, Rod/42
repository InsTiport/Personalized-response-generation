  Q.  How were course conditions?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  It was pretty tough.  Obviously very windy out there and those shower squalls coming through made it interesting.  But the golf course held up really well.  The greens were really nice out there.   
  
  Q.  And how was 18?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  18.  Extremely tough.  I was fortunate, I hit a good tee shot and was still hitting 2-iron to that front pin.  They are all pretty tough, but with water left it makes it very demanding.   
  
  Q.  What about 3?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  I think 3 was the hardest one today.  You know, you can't miss it right there at all.  You are nearly always in that left rough and basically if you get a good lie you can go for the green and if not you're laying up.   
 Yeah, they are two holes I'm glad I got pars on today.   
  
  Q.  What's your preparation like now?   
 ROD PAMPLING:  My coach gets over next week.  The golf's been pretty ugly the last couple of months -- inaudible -- no, we've been working hard, it's starting to come around.  I putted well today and had not putted well for a while, changed putters, changed grip and it worked really well.
