 Q.   Bookended the week with 11 points.   Got to be feeling good about the week.   
ROD PAMPLING:   Yeah, it was a great week.   It's a fun place to come.   Obviously the system I like.   
Yeah, it was a fantastic and great way to make the putt there on the last.  
Hopefully helped us a little bit more.  
   
 Q.   Anything in particular about your game you felt really good about this week?   
ROD PAMPLING:   It was just solid sort of all the way through.   Yeah, also just myself.   Just keeping control of that was the key.  
It's all been decent, but I just been a little bit too antsy myself.   I've just tried to take a chill, which is good out here, because you can't do much without breath.  
Yeah, that was the part I think that worked the best was just staying calm over everything and just getting back to playing golf, not overthinking and all that.
