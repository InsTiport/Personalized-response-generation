 Q. Talking to you again, it had to be a pretty good day, two back-to-back 68s. Talk about the first and second round. 
 ROD PAMPLING: Actually the first round it was really nasty. Today it was a little bit scrappy, but it seemed like every time it just missed the green and it made it. I don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing, but I'm very happy.

 Q. Five birdies today. Did the course change at all? Did it get firmer and faster?
 ROD PAMPLING: A little bit firmer. But it's the wind. It's tricky out there. You feel like the wind is blowing at you 20 miles an hour, and then you take two steps and it's behind you. It's very interesting how the wind swirls so much out here. 
 The course, it's definitely getting firmer, but it's still playing very nicely.

 Q. You say you hit the ball great in round 1, and round 2 you hit it you would say okay. What's the word going into the weekend for you?
 ROD PAMPLING: Hopefully we'll hit it really good and putt like today. 

 Q. 68 is a good number, you put up a couple more of those, and I don't know how to tell you this, but I'll probably be talking to you again on the weekend. 
 ROD PAMPLING: That's good.
