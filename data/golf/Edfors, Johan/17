  JOHAN EDFORS: We were rushing the last couple of holes to be able to finish, so nice to get a couple of hours more sleep tonight.  
  
  Q. You're a fit man and you sound a little bit breathless.   
 JOHAN EDFORS: Well, I didn't think we would get it done, actually, when we had five or six holes left, but somehow we are here now, so it feels really good.  
  
  Q. And you kept things going very nicely with the birdies later on.   
 JOHAN EDFORS: It was nice. I was playing pretty good today, but the putts just wouldn't drop and finally I made one on No. 7 and then hit it up close on 8, and so it was nice to be rewarded with a couple of late birdies there.   
  
  Q. I guess there are times when you're rushing and you let things slip just that little bit just to get them done, so to finish like this, has to be rewarding.   
 JOHAN EDFORS: Definitely, it's quite easy to throw a couple of shots away when you're rushing a bit, so I'm glad I didn't do that today.  
  
  Q. Nicely in position?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: Definitely, so it's looking good for the weekend.   
  
  Q. I don't know if, certainly not hard to believe the scoring, because the course is there if you're playing well, but 11-under is impressive.   
 JOHAN EDFORS: I'll tell you this, if you hit a lot of fairways, the greens are pretty receptive and they are rolling good, as well. So you get a lot of birdie chances if you play well. But it's a punishing course if you don't play well.  
  
  Q. Presumably you feel competitive heading into the weekend?   
 JOHAN EDFORS: I'm hitting the ball good and stroking the putter nicely, as well.   
 Just hope a few more will drop during the weekend.
