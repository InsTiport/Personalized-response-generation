CARNOUSTIE     (76,   -5 OVERALL )
JOHAN EDFORS:  It was tough out there and I wasn't playing that well, but I was fighting and was level par for the day after 15 holes. But then my finish has really hurt me, especially the triple bogey on the 17th.

I hit a bad tee shot, up on to a bank and in a poor spot but I thought I could get enough on it to chase it up on to the green. But I closed the club on the ball and it ended up in a bush. From there it was unplayable and I had to take a drop. After all that, I went into a bunker on the last and bogeyed that too, so it's very disappointing because I was hanging in there well until those last three holes.
