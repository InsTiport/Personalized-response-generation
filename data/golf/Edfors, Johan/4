   JOHAN EDFORS: Fantastic finish, didn't get off to a very good start today, 3-over after five, and then after I played some really, really good golf, and managed to hole a long putt on the last to really make it count. 

 Q. 31 on the back nine, five threes in the last six holes, must have been playing some golf. 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, I actually played good on the front nine as well apart from the third and the fifth hole where I made a bogey and a double-bogey and gave myself a lot of good chances. Just couldn't buy a putt on the front nine and suddenly the hole sort of opened up a little bit on the back nine.

 Q. Pretty good week last week, as well, you must feel a win is not too far away. 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Definitely. I'm striking the ball nicely and my putting has improved a lot, so I know every week my putting is good, I have a chance to win. So try to bring that putting on to the rest of the summer.
