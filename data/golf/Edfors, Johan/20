   JOHAN EDFORS:  I have been playing well all week and haven't holed any putts. I finally holed a few on the front nine and was five under for the turn and seven under through 13. I gave myself plenty of chances coming in as well with two three putts and a chip and two putts on the 17th. I was up there and really had a chance. Of course I am happy with a 65 but not happy with the finish. I knew standing on 17 I needed to go birdie eagle to have a chance. I hit a great drive on the 17th but was not aggressive enough with the chip and missed from 12 feet for birdie. I knew I had to make an eagle on the last and ran the first putt four feet past and missed the one back. 

 Q.  How have you enjoyed your experience in India? 
 JOHAN EDFORS:  It has been a great week. The weather has been fantastic and it is a fun and exciting course so I think I will be back again. I really liked it this week so if it fits in the schedule I will probably be back. 

 Q.  How was the course out there today? 
 JOHAN EDFORS:  I thought they were generous with the flags the first three days and they spiced it up today. I wish they had done that early as it would have been tougher and I was playing well so think I would have done well. 

 Q.  What do you think of Indian golfers now? 
 JOHAN EDFORS:  India is a golf powerhouse nowadays. There is a big population so guess we will see more in the future and I am expecting big things from India in the future.
