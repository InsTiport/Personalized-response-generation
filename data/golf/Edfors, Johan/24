JOHAN EDFORS:  It was a very disappointing finish, to have a bogey on 16 and a double bogey on 17, especially when you only have a wedge in your hand on the 17th. That really annoyed and upset me and I was pleased to finish with a birdie to get back into double figures under par. You shouldn't make a double with a wedge in your hand. I got a bit greedy and went for the flag and went into the Road Hole bunker and had no shot.

I had a lot of good chances out there. It was definitely encouraging that I am putting well. If I keep holing my share I have a chance of winning again. That would be nice over courses where I watched great golfers winning during my own childhood.

Carnoustie is the only place I played in practice and I am looking forward to tomorrow. It's a great course and hopefully I will come back to St Andrews on Sunday with a chance to win. I like the big events with world-class golfers competing and I have the chance to play well and try to win.
