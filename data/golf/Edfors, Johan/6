 Q. You've beaten one of Europe's finest match players, Miguel Ãngel, JimÃ©nez, how does that feel? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: It feels great. We both didn't quite start off very good. I played nicely for a while and Miguel was struggling a little bit. I had a nice cushion there for a while but he made his comeback there, so I was a little nervous at the end. 

 Q. Tell us about that, because you were 4-up with seven to play, and all of a sudden it's 1-up with four to play. What's going through your mind? What are you thinking and feeling?
 JOHAN EDFORS: I felt really comfortable after 11, I was 4-up, and if I can just make some pars in from here, it should be enough. I made two sloppy bogeys where he made two great up-and-downs for par, and suddenly I was two up and then he made a great pitch shot on 14 to go to 1-up. 
 And I was struggling on the next one, 12, got away with a halve on that one, and then made a mistake and made a bogey. I was quite relieved. 

 Q. Schwartzel this afternoon, Masters Champion, your thoughts on that match?
 JOHAN EDFORS: He's a great player, one of the best players in the world, and it's going to be a tough match. But all of the matches here are tough. I'm just going to try to do my best.
