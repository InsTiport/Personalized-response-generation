 Q. 4-under par, looked like it was going to be another low round but stumbled a bit on the back nine, what was wrong? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: I was hitting the ball pretty nicely but didn't get it really close, 12- and 15-footers, and hit some good putts but they didn't fall. 
 I'm still happy with the way I played after yesterday, and roll a few putts tomorrow, who knows.

 Q. What was the difference between 61 day one, 74 and now 67? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Well, the wind was the total opposite so that made a little difference. The par 5s were playing easy and I could reach a couple of par 4s and I was driving it fantastic and gave myself a lot of really good chances to be honest and then holed a couple of -- two long putts, as well, and that always helps out.

 Q. When you look up at the leaderboard and there's names like Parry and Jarmo, do you think you've got a real good chance here?
 JOHAN EDFORS: Oh, definitely, I think that every time I'm within four or five shots in the final rounds, I think I have a good chance. Definitely I have a good chance this week.

 Q. So do you think this course suits you? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Oh, definitely, it does. It's fairly wide. You can hit driver everywhere and I really like hitting driver, so it's been good. 

 Q. What had on the eagle? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: I hit a good driver and a little 7-iron up to 20 feet and holed a nice little putt downhill there. 

 Q. Is this the course you got the 61 on, does this that give you confident going back to that course, thinking shot a low number once and you can do it again?
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, sure, I made a lot of birdies in the Pro-Am as well. I know this is a course where you can take it really deep and make a lot of birdies so even if you don't get the best of starts, you can shoot 7-under on the back so you're never out of it really.
