  Q. Save for 18, very good round.   
 JOHAN EDFORS: Thank you very much. I played really nicely today. It was a good comeback from the finish I had yesterday on the back nine.   
  
  Q. Most of the golfers have come off the course and many of them have said there are scores out there to be had. In your estimation is that the case today, and does that account for your number?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, I mean, definitely. There are some tough pins that are pretty fast in some of the spots, but if you can get your putter going, there are definitely some birdies out there with the greens as receptive as they are. If you're hitting the ball well, you're going to give yourself a lot of opportunities, and you're just going to have to hold the putter after that.  
  
  Q. At 18 what happened?   
 JOHAN EDFORS: You know, I was just going to play it up on the right, but I knew if I birdied the last I had a good chance of getting inside the top 10 and getting to come back next year. I hit a really good shot straight at the flag, but it was a couple of yards too short, so it went down back in the water.  
  
  Q. So being hopeful for next year, did that sort of affect your decision on what to hit?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, it did. I mean, it was -- I'd made my mind up just to hit it up on the right part of the green, but the last one went back to the hole, and I wanted it to go there. It was a good up-and-down, though.  
  
  Q. Overall, this weekend, how has it worked for you, the whole experience at Congressional?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: I mean, very nice. It feels great to be this close to the leaders, or maybe not the leader but to second place, at least. I left a lot out there, a couple really bad nines. So I know when my game is on top, I can compete with all the guys out here.
