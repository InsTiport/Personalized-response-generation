  Q. How was it?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: A little up-and-down to be honest. Played really good in bits and pieces and had a couple of hiccups out there but three eagles saved my round. I'm still in there.  
  
  Q. There's a handful of guys and you're probably one of them that this course suits to a tee, fair to say?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, you feel pretty comfortable off the tee out here so you can give it a bit of a whack on most of the holes. Yeah, it's all a big advantage to be in the fairway but you can get away with a couple of wayward tee shots out there definitely.  
  
  Q. Anything new in the world of Johan Edfors?   
 JOHAN EDFORS: Not really. Making a lot more eagles than I have been lately so that's new I guess.  
  
  Q. What about the golf course, condition-wise?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: It's good. It needs a little bit more rough to be honest but I think I had a pretty dry part of the season, struggle to get the overseeding going in the rough there, so it's playing a bit easier than normal and it's been barely no wind at all and it makes a big difference on this golf course.  
  
  Q. Do you like an event that's a birdie race?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: Definitely. It's always fun to make a few birdies and I think the spectators enjoy seeing birdies and the eagles and the stuff like that.   
 So I mean, you sort of new that was going to be a really low score to win this week, so I'm in there after three rounds so hopefully I can play a little bit better on the weekend and get close to that 30 Mark that I think is going to be needed.  
  
  Q. You chose blue today, what colour will you go with tomorrow for a sexy Saturday?  
 JOHAN EDFORS: I played a bit better yesterday so I might go back to something green.
