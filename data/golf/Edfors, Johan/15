   JOHAN EDFORS: Been playing well for quite some time now. But haven't really gotten any results on The European Tour, but that win on the Asian Tour really gave the confidence a bit of a boost. So I'm really happy with the way I'm playing. 

 Q. A lot of people will remember that you were pretty close to making The Ryder Cup Team in 2006. You won three times and could have been at The K Club in that wonderful match, but you won three times in 2006 and you've gone on a bit of a dry run since. Why is that?
 JOHAN EDFORS: Well, I mean, I think I'm a better golfer now than I was in 2006. I'm much more steady, my game is much more steady now. I've had four or five really good weeks, and I'm finding a bit of a touch on the greens and hopefully I can put another win in this week. 
 I kept on knocking them really close on the first day. I got a lot of really easy birdies, actually, and today I was playing really nicely, especially on the back nine, but couldn't quite hole the putts. But I'm quite happy where I am right now, and just have a good weekend now. 

 Q. Is there a point when you get into contention that your mind-set changes a bit? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: You're under pressure when you have a chance of winning a tournament and I really thrive on adrenaline rush and all that, and quite often I seem to rise to the occasion I think. So I guess I have that going for me. 

 Q. Biggest rush you've ever had? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Probably in China on the last hole, TCL, I got my card back from the Qualifying School and knew I had to birdie the last hole. I was still thinking, well, second is pretty good, I've almost secured my card and all that, but I went for it and made a great birdie there on 18, and that's probably the biggest rush I've ever had.
