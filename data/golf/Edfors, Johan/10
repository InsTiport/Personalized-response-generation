 Q. Tell us, if you would, that's so different to the first day. 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, I was, what, five 3-putts doesn't really help, and I was really struggling on the greens all day and lost a ball on one of the par 5s there and I made two doubles in a row there. 
 So didn't get off to the best of starts, with four 3-putts on the front nine so I was 5-over after 8, and then I played really, really good, but I couldn't hold a putt and I was 2-putting my way around and made a couple of birdies there. Hit it up really close on 11, I think it was, the par 3, and made a little tap-in birdie there and birdied 12 and 13 and had a good chance on 14, 15, birdied 16 and 3-putted 17 again. 
 So I played pretty nicely the last ten holes at least. 

 Q. In terms of damage limitation, there has not been a lot of harm done, has there, really? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: No, I was playing -- I had not seen that course before, actually. So it was a bit trickier than the Marly Course I thought. My clubs didn't arrive on Tuesday, so I didn't get to play a practise round. I only had a look at the particularly course, and I probably should have paid a little more attention to the course. 

 Q. So you almost shot a 59 with only having that minimum of practise, and now I guess the course given all of the heavy overnight rain was going to be harder anyway, wasn't it? 
 JOHAN EDFORS: Yeah, I had really good speed yesterday on my putts, but today I was completely off. First couple of holes, I left it way short and on the back nine, I ran it by all the time. Couldn't find any pace.
