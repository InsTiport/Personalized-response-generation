MICHAEL GIBBONS:  Very good round of golf today.  At what point did you think today you were in with a chance?
JOHAN EDFORS:  I made a birdie on 9, and I made the turn at 6 under there, tied for the lead.  So if I had a good back nine, with 3  or 4 under, I'd have a chance.  I didn't quite get to that point but I played really well and gave myself a chance there at the end.  Didn't manage to make it and unfortunately made a bogey on 17.  But the rest of the round was good.

MICHAEL GIBBONS:  You seemed quite angry this morning after yesterday.
JOHAN EDFORS:  I was really upset after yesterday.  The game felt good and the warmup never felt better, and then to go out and play like rubbish, I mean, I played absolutely horrible yesterday and I worked for an hour after the round and felt I had been playing well the first two rounds, and I knew I was really close.  Got off to a good start with a birdie on 2 and made four in a row, 4 through 7.
Q.  What would it mean to win here?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Oh, it would mean a lot.  I was really tired six weeks, after I won the second time, played two in a row after that, I was really, really tired.  Last week I practiced and it's really a new start and a new season for me.
Q.  With the Ryder Cup points this week
JOHAN EDFORS:  If I am, it's going to be a great thing.  It would be an honour to represent Europe in the Ryder Cup Team.  I've been dreaming of that since I was a little kid.  I haven't really been close before, so if it happens, it happens.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Yeah, I have changed everything you could say.  After losing my card in 2004, I realized that that wasn't good enough.  So I had always done it my way and decided I was going to try to talk to more people and see if I needed to make some changes.  I felt I couldn't play good enough on the courses on The European Tour, and that was a new thing for me.  I thought I was well prepared when I played my first year.

So started with two new coaches and we are changing everything.  Still a long ways to go and it's a work in progress.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  I'm still right in between.  It's a completely different swing when I'm practicing than when I am on the golf course.  The changes I'm doing are helping me even, so I'm gradually getting there.  I thought it would take a couple of weeks but we've been doing it for 18 months now and getting closer and closer.  Maybe next year.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Actually my whole family was here with me this week.  So it's been great.  I had fish on Friday and the fish didn't work, so yesterday we had meat again and that seems to be much better.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  I think I will, yeah.
Q.  Who are your coaches?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Michael Body.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Oh, definitely that is probably what has made the most, the biggest difference is before I only did what I felt like, hit a few balls and now I'm much more structured than I've ever been in my whole life.  That has probably helped me the most.  I know every day what I'm going to do.  So I can sum up the week, even if I miss the cut by ten shots    inaudible    the result isn't as important to me anymore.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Yeah, we did.  No, that wasn't bad.  My dad yesterday turned 60 and my brother in law is turning 40, so me and my girlfriend brought them here.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Yeah, it's quite a big difference actually.  Mostly in my backswing, making a much bigger turn and not coming too much through my hips.  It's a big difference from a year and a half ago and I'm starting to get much more comfortable.

I thought it would have only taken few weeks in the beginning otherwise I never would have done the changes.  It always takes a long time to work on it but I'm getting closer and closer to maybe next year I can use the swing on the course that I'm using in practice.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Yeah, I am, I have two coaches but kind of going through each other.  I use mostly more my swing and Lars Everson (ph), the guy who is more like a mental coach.  It's good.  I need someone to be there with a whip and he's got a big whip.  (Laughter).
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Well, it's going to be a completely different type of golf down there.  I went down on Monday and really liked what I saw.  It will come down to putting.  If it's windy, it's going to be very, very tough, really hard on the ground.
Q.  Inaudible?
JOHAN EDFORS:  Well, we started putting some new clubs in the bag this week so I'm not confident off the tee with any club except the driver, so with the rescue club and 3 wood    the rescue club is staying in the bag.
