Q. I saw you had 5-under on the back nine today.  It looks like an incredible round and you probably qualified for the RICOH Women's British Open?
LINA BOQVIST: Maybe.  I didn't play so good the first nine.  I haven't played the first nine so good the whole week.  The last nine is much better.  But yeah, I came up with five birdies the last nine, and maybe ready for the weekend.
Q. Is that motivating you this week?  Is that a little bit on your mind?
LINA BOQVIST: Yeah, of course.  I missed the cut three years ago by one shot.  It was a very good week and I love the course, and yeah, the weather was quite windy but I like it.
Q. Did you play in The Scottish Open last year?
LINA BOQVIST: Yeah, I missed the cut by one.  I played with a fever and I played with a fever yesterday, too.  But it was a little bit better this year.
Q. So this is your second year here at the Ladies Scottish Open?
LINA BOQVIST: Third year.
Q. What did you think of the improvements?
LINA BOQVIST: It's very good.  It's much better this year than last year because it's so much bigger and the LPGA is here, too.  It's more people and more good people here.  And the men played here two weeks ago.  Yeah, it's very good.
Q. Looking ahead to next week, is it your first major?
LINA BOQVIST: No, I played last year.  So it's my second major.
Q. How much are you looking forward to playing in Kingsbarns?
LINA BOQVIST: Yeah, looking forward very much.  If I can make a spot here, it should be very good, and maybe not, I get it from the qualifying.  So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
Q. So you like playing in these tough weather conditions?
LINA BOQVIST: I'm not used to because my home course is not so much wind, but yeah, it seems to.  I like it.
Q. What's your home course?
LINA BOQVIST: Isaberg in Sweden, in the south of Sweden.  So we have not so much wind like this.
