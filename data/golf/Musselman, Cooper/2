Q. What's the feeling like making the cut?
COOPER MUSSELMAN: Still feels pretty unreal.  Played pretty well today.  Left maybe -- got kind of nervous down the stretch, but, you know, that's just a part of it.
I'll hopefully learn and play better round three.
Q. Why nervous?
COOPER MUSSELMAN: I normally don't look at the scoreboard, and I accidently peeked over at one and saw what the number was.  I don't know, it's just never good for me.  I just need to keep my mind focused on keep going as low as possible.
Once I caught that number I just couldn't stop thinking about it, which I definitely need to work on.
Q. Did you play any more conservative when you knew you were on the cut line?
COOPER MUSSELMAN: No, I didn't play any more conservative.  Just had a bad thought in my head.  Yeah, just need to work on that.
Q. Highlights today of your round?
COOPER MUSSELMAN: Highlight was probably three birdies in a row.  Made a bogey on 3 and then I birdied, what was it, 6, 7, and 8.  So just those back-to-back birdies really got my day started.
Q. How big was it to do that after that bogey?
COOPER MUSSELMAN: It was huge, huge for confidence.  Didn't really hit it well the first three holes.  Made a good putt or hit a good shot, had two-putts in, and then made a good putt on 16.  That really got me in a good zone for the rest of the day.
