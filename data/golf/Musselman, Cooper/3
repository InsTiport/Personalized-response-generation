 Q.  First round in a PGA TOUR event.  How did it feel?  
COOPER MUSSELMAN: Felt pretty good.  I was pretty nervous at the start.  Just a little bit more nervous than I expected to be.   
Good start with a birdie and then kind of a tougher stretch.  And then (indiscernible) couple birdies and throw an eagle in there.  (Indiscernible).   
Felt pretty good.  Kind of had a number in my head today, it was 3-under.  (Indiscernible.)   
 Q.  How much did that early birdie help you to settle the nerves?  
COOPER MUSSELMAN: It helped.  It helped a lot.  It was pretty cool just to see everyone out there.  I saw my dad's hands go way up in the air, which was really cool.
