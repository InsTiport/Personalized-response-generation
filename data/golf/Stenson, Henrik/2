  Q. In years gone by, a veteran of the European Tour, two wins at this tournament.  You know everything it takes to win around this golf course.  Why is it so tough out there for you guys today?
 HENRIK STENSON:   I think the breeze is certainly up a little bit more than it's been the previous couple of days here, and then I think the fairways are definitely tighter.  I mean, it's a slightly different golf course we see this time around compared to mid-November, so thicker rough, narrower fairways.  The runoffs are not what they used to be around the greens, but I think in one way that should make it play easier because the ball is going to stop closer to the pin, but just the pin positions are really tucked away in a lot of corners, and I think that will reflect on the scoring.
 Q. One of the things we're looking forward to this year is the opportunity perhaps for an American to add their name as one of the winners of the Race to Dubai.  It's something you've achieved on two occasions being the European Tour's No. 1 --
 HENRIK STENSON:   I'm not looking forward to that.
 Q. I know you're not necessarily looking forward to it, but the opportunity, and the fact that they're travelling, as well, and somebody has added their name to the list along Sir Nick Faldo, Seve, Norman, Lyle, Woosnam, all these sorts of players, what does it truly mean to say you're the No. 1 on this Tour?
 HENRIK STENSON:   Oh, it's a great achievement.  You've been the one to try and catch for the whole year, and yeah, I'm super proud to have my name on the Race to Dubai trophy, the Harry Vardon trophy twice, and I'm not going to get it a third time, not this year at least, but no, they're fighting it out for great honour, and like I say, there's a couple of other guys who certainly travelled, and Patrick Reed in particular has been playing a lot on the European Tour in the last couple years, so he's right up there, and also Collin Morikawa with his fine win at the PGA.  Yeah, it'll be an interesting weekend to see.
