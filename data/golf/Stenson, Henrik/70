HENRIK STENSON: I took advantage of that.  I got off to a flying start.  Made two birdies straight out of the blocks and hit a lot of good putts, made some really good ones for par, for birdie.  And, yeah, I think it could have been one or two shots better, as well.  But I'm obviously pleased with the day's work.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: It might well have to be something like that and depending on what the last couple of groups are doing.  If they keep on making birdies, that 63 might not even be good enough.
We'll see.  I'm just happy with up the way I played today, and should move up in the result list and hopefully get closer to the leaders.  But you never know, they might shoot 5 or 6-under today, we'll just have to sit back and watch.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, certainly got great support today and great reception, full on kind of -- what with should I say -- walking on to every green it was great support, a lot of claps.  And I truly felt the support and the fans were great.  So it was a good day to play in front of them and they certainly didn't forget last year's championship.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I think it could be a combination, that he's 23 and I'm 41 and he said he'd watched me on television growing up.  So I think it could be a combination really that he was 13 years old watching me play out here and doing well.  It was great company.  I never met him, never played with him before, but he's a solid player.  He didn't have the kind of day that he would have liked to but we had a good time out there.  And he finished with a couple of birdies, so that surely made it feel a little bit better for him.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I think we could have been sniffing around those numbers, as well.  I made some great putts out there, but I also had a couple that were really close and I didn't take advantage of 17 the way I would have liked to.  And one or two more on the front nine, for sure.  So, yeah, I don't think it would have been impossible for me to shoot a similar number today.  But as I said, I'm happy with the 65.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I don't feel like it was -- it's obviously not a nice incident and anything you want to go through.  It's more a hassle getting -- I didn't want to tee it up like I looked in the Ryder Cup a couple of years ago, standing in my boxer shorts on the first fee would have been so so.  It was all the mess getting everything organized, getting my clothes fixed and back ready to play golf.  But it's some sort of disturbance.  I spent those fours hours, instead of relaxing, watching a movie and chilling out, we had to do other things.
It wasn't great, but I'm glad to inform you I haven't lost anything in the last two days, so things are pretty good at the moment.
