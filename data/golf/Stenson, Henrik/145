 Q.  What do you think of this scenario?  
HENRIK STENSON: I think it's been rather wet today.  It continues to be that way.  I mean, we play an outdoor sport, you get these every now and again.  We've got a pretty long day ahead of us tomorrow, but we'll get it done eventually.   
 Q.  I know you haven't hit a shot, but you'll have seen the course, it's quite evident, can't take much more.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, when it was a heavy downpour, there was a flood coming over the 18th and the putting green was completely underwater.  It's not playable, and we're just going to try to get all the golf done tomorrow instead.   
 Q.  How will it be for you with your knee issues?  
HENRIK STENSON: I hope it's going to hold up.  I can feel a little bit when I play the 18 holes, but we'll try and push through.   
 Q.  I suppose you get a rhythm; you go from one round to the next.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, let's hope for no further delays tomorrow and we'll try and get this thing finished.
