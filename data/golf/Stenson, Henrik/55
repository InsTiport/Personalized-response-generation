Q. Best round of the week, in arguably the toughest conditions.  How pleased were you?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, very good.  I've been working all week and trying to get things in order for the season ahead.  Seemed like we finally got there on Sunday, at least.
I hit the ball much much better today than I had done the previous days, and also last week in Malaysia.  So very pleased with that.  I felt good before I walked out on to the golf course, and yeah, I managed to hit a lot of good shots out there.  It's tough conditions, and when I was in trouble, short game and putting seemed to back that up.  So, yeah, very happy with that.
Q. You mentioned the conditions with the wind.  How much did affect?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, at times, we were going off about 25 yards of help going down there.  I think I hit an 8-iron on the sixth from about 210.  I think I hit it very close with an 8-iron from that yardage, and obviously when you're turning back into it, it's not going to be as much fun.
It's playing tough out there.  Still receptive greens.  That makes a big difference.  Putting is always a little tricky standing over those 4- and 5-footers and bounce all over the place, but they stay on and you hopefully wiggle them in.  I managed to do that today.
Q. Nice way to finish on 18, as well.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I didn't get the tee shot when I needed to to reach in two and played up and hit a lovely gap wedge to about four feet and rolled that in.  So it was nice to finish with birdie, birdie.  You know, it not the easiest holes, 16, 17, so yeah, we'll see where that puts us at the end of the day.
Q. A lot of positives now, you take from this week heading into the next few weeks?
HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely.  I feel like I said, it's probably the best that I've played since I won on the PGA TOUR in August last year, this round that I put together here today.  So very promising for the weeks ahead.
