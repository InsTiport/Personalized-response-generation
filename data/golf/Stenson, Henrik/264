 Q. How impressed have you been of Martin's return to form recently?HENRIK STENSON: Martin who?  No, he's -- we know he's a world class player and a Major champion, a former world No. 1, so I guess we're not surprised.  It's great to see him back in good form, and like you said, I heard one of his interviews, he's reaping the rewards of hard work and was playing great at the PLAYERS and playing even better here.  I would imagine he would look at it that way, that he's playing even better this week than he did at Sawgrass. So all credit to him and he's the one everyone's trying to catch.  If we take him out of the leaderboard, it's pretty exciting.  But he's potentially running away with this championship.  If he does so, we'll be one of the first ones to stand by the 18th congratulating him.
Q. How do you rate your chances from here on?HENRIK STENSON: I wouldn't -- if he keeps on playing well, I wouldn't rates the chances that great.  I don't think anyone would rate their chances great.  But it's still a long way to go, 36 holes is a lot of golf and a lot of things can happen. I don't know if it's good or bad for the chasing pack that the course is still playing soft and looking at the weather we might have even more rain tonight and there's no way they can get this place firm over the weekend now, given the softness that it is now and if we get more rain coming. So we have got a hard time knowing if it's good or bad.  If it's soft you can definitely attack.  If it's getting firmer, if it would have gotten firm, then it's a different course and a different game plan.  But on the other hand, then if you're not playing great, you can drop more shots if it's really firm. So we just have to wait and see.  I think I'll stick to my game plan for another nine or 18, at least, and the goal would always be to be within three or five shots, with 18 to go, you know you got a chance then if you do something brilliant. So it's more about trying to work your way up and I managed to come back with three birdies in my last five holes to get back to red figures for the day and 2-under total.  So I'm quite pleased with that and just going to keep on working away and we'll see what the rest does.
Q. What Martin had his dip in form, did you always think that he might come back again and how good is this for the European Ryder Cup team?HENRIK STENSON: I'm a pretty bad pal and I'm a bad analyst, because I didn't think he was going to come back, even with what I've done, right?  So we all go through ups and downs.  And if you were a great player once, there's no reason why you wouldn't be it again. So whether -- and his, his caddie said to my caddie at the Masters, that's, moving in the right direction and he was obviously very right, winning TPC a couple of weeks later and playing so well here. So, yeah, I don't, I'm never going to doubt on anyone if they're going to come back.  Whether it happens and when it hams, but the belief is always there.
Q. Do you feel this is obviously good for Europe's Ryder Cup team, because one or two of the other previous stars don't seem to be playing as well.HENRIK STENSON: Hello, Jordan. (Laughter.) Yeah, of course it's great for the European team, having a lot of its players playing well.  And again it's shaping up to be a strong team.  And we know what Martin did last time, so of course, we would like to have him in Scotland with a nice 5-footer on the last to win it again.
