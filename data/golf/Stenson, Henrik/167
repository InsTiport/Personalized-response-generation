Q. What are your thoughts on 66 to move up there?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I mean, headed in the right direction obviously.  Played a lot nicer today.  I hit some solid iron shots.  Put a couple in there really close and the putter was working really nicely.  That was the big difference.  I didn't make too much the first couple of days but today I made a bunch.
Q. And this has been done in a whole range of weather conditions, really, with disruption, as well.
HENRIK STENSON: Luckily I got a bit of my warmup done before we had to get in the clubhouse there before we actually started the first round.  Then it got a bit rushed; we only had half an hour to get out there, and then I played three holes and I got off to a good start, birdied 10, birdied 12.
And just as my ball dropped in the hole for a birdie, they hit the horn, and we were back in the clubhouse for about an hour I guess, 45 minutes, and we're straight back out and kept on going.  Bit of an on-and-off day, but glad to be finished and glad to have shot a good score.
Q. Looking at that leaderboard, still a bit of a distance, so what are your thoughts into the final day?
HENRIK STENSON: That I didn't play well enough the first two days.  Yeah, I left myself way back.  Yeah, just happy to get a good score and feel like I played a little bit nicer.  Hadn't played that great last week in Malaysia or the beginning of this week, so hopefully we're starting to pick up some form.
