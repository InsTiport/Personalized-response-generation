Q. First two rounds kind of cruised around.  Today was a little bit a different story.  Would you describe today?
HENRIK STENSON: I got off to a great start, hit some great shots early and made a couple putts and we had a couple of bad shots, you know, duffed the 7-iron on 7, tried to go after it and struck it badly and cost me two.
And then I couldn't get a birdie on 8, 9 or 10 even though I had some chances, and winged a tee shot on 11, had to settle for a bogey there.  It's all about how you finish, I guess.  I came back strongly, great birdies coming home and right where we want to be.
Q. I would imagine in that situation sometimes it's easy to get frustrated because you keep hitting it in good proximity to the hole.  You had that trouble at the 7th hole, you hung in there and had four birdies coming in the back-9.
HENRIK STENSON: Very calm and collected there.  Seemed to be that way today.  I hope it's the same tomorrow.
Q. Give us the plan of attack for tomorrow based on the first three rounds here at Sedgefield Country Club.
HENRIK STENSON: Obviously what I've done so far is working pretty well and I'm playing the course the way I think it's best for me and I just trying to keep on hitting a lot of fairways and if you do that you can set-up a lot of birdie chances with mid to short irons.
I've been hitting those nice and rolling it good.  Got to keep on producing chances.
Q. All the best tomorrow.
HENRIK STENSON: Thank you.
Q. You were even par on your round on Saturday through 2 holes but birdied four of your last six.
What did you find was a little special about your round?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah.  I got off to a great start.  I birdied four holes in the first six and then I had a bit of a rough patch in the middle, hit two bad shots, duffed a 7-iron on 7.  That cost me two hitting into the water, and missed a tee shot on 11, cost me a bogey.
Yeah, things weren't going great in the middle of the round but I was hanging in there and hit a couple of nice shots and made a couple of putts coming home and we find ourselves right where we want to be for Sunday.
Q. As you look back at the holes you played, what has impressed you with as far as your game?
HENRIK STENSON: I think the putting.  I've seen the lines nicely.  Hit a lot of good putts and I've been hitting a lot of good iron shots as well, some wedges and some mid to short irons, and that's kind of what I keep on doing and trying to hit a lot of fairways with the 3-wood and trying to attacking the hole and that's been working nicely so far.  No need to change that for tomorrow.
Q. You got to feel pretty good about where you stand heading into tomorrow.
HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely.  You can't win a tournament on Saturday but you can certainly put your name out of the mix.  I started off nice and made four birdies in the first six holes, then I had a bit of a rough patch.  Bad 7-iron on 7 that cost me two and bad tee shot on 11, cost me another bogey.
Standing on the 12th, things weren't going great but I was hanging in there and kept my patience and kept on hitting good shots and got the reward for a couple of good shots and couple of putts coming in and birdied four of the last six.
So, happy with that kind of momentum change and we find ourselves right where we want to be Sunday.
Q. Talk about when there's so many guys this close to the lead.  That can be either nerve-wracking, could be challenging but there's so many guys that have a chance.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah.  It's just going -- you got to keep on going tomorrow.  You got to keep on making birdies.
And, like I say, it's a lot of players with a chance and we'll see come back-9 tomorrow who is going to be there and I'm just happy to be in this position.  I've been in contention a lot this year so it feels nice to be out there again and I'm just going to try and carry on my game plan the first three days, keep on producing birdie chances and hopefully I'll make enough putts to stand alone on 18 tomorrow.
Q. How patient did you have to be after the double on the bogey at 11?
HENRIK STENSON: You have to be patient.  I felt very calm.  I mishit the shots and went for a big 7-iron and didn't catch it by any means and pay the price for it but I felt -- I feel like I'm in a good place mentally.  Keep my patience and keep on doing the things I know I need to do to play well and produce good scores.  Thankfully that turned things around and on this 3rd Round and keep us, you know, right where we want to be.
