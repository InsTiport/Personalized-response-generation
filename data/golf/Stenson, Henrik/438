 Q.  Henrik, well played, great finish, as well. 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Thank you very much.  I mean, these are nice events from K Club when Zach played fantastic and was putting great.  I thought today maybe he can't have the same putter, but surely it was there.  He made everything up until 15.  I was 1-down fighting hard, and then I just made a great up-and-down when he had a three and a half footer for birdie. 
 And he lipped out on that one, so I got away with a halve on that one which was crucial.  It would have been the nail in the coffin otherwise.  Then I managed to get one in on 16 from about 20 feet, something like that, 15 feet, for birdie, and hit two good shots and a great pitch and birdied 17, as well, to go 1-up. 
 I was a bit off  With the driver, and the only bad drive of the day really on 1.  It wasn't a good lie anyway and came up a bit short off the blade on 18.  Good two-putt and I thought heading down the first, given his putter is so hot, though, he just missed by, so that was nice 

 Q.  Nice to get that win under your belt? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, it was tight all day, and I was ahead the first couple of holes and then it turned around.  Every time he was in a bad spot he managed to get up-and-down, and his putter was fantastic.  It was a tough match.  I knew it was going to be a tough one, but very happy to come out on top. 

 Q.  Does this course suit you? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, it suits me.  It's a lot of drives and I've been hitting my driver good, so that's definitely one thing.  I just need to get my -- it was actually my pitching, which is normally pretty good.  It was a little bit off today, and one or two putts that could have dropped. 
 A little bit more to wish for around the greens, but I haven't played for two weeks, either, so given that I'm in pretty good shape. 

 Q.  You're looking forward to the next round? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Absolutely.  It's my friend Carl, I think.  It's two Swedes.
