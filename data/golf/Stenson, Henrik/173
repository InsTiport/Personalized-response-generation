Q. Talk about today's round if you could and where you are right now.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm pleased with the day's work.  It was definitely tougher conditions out there.  The course is playing longer, it's very wet, and still the greens are holding up very good.  They're quick and pure as ever.
Some longer shots into the greens, and I'm happy with the way I got it together.  I didn't feel like I brought my best game, my best striking today, but I still shot under par, which is always nice and we're in a similar position as we were after one round, but now after two.  So, so far, so good.
Q. Any pressure to lift the cup again or is it business as usual?
HENRIK STENSON: No I'm just trying to do my thing really.  I know the guys are going to come chasing me down as hard as they can.
Jordan put a good score today and I'm out with him in the last group tomorrow.
So there's plenty of work to do if I want to be near that trophy on Sunday night.  But I'm going to give it my best shot and, yeah, still a long ways to go and we'll see what happens.
Q. Does playing with Jordan in that last group raise your level at all, knowing the kind of year he's had, the kind of buzz he's created?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, we know how good he is.  So it's inspirational and I know that when you are out with any of the guys you know you're going to get a tough competitor with you.  And I'm just going to try and bring my game tomorrow as much as I can and focus on my game, because it's no point going around there watching what he does too much.  I know he's going to be playing well and I need to do the same.  So looking forward to the third round.
