Q. Can I just get a bit of reaction to Silver Medal for your country, how does it feel? Obviously mixed emotions. 
HENRIK STENSON: Of course, when you're in good position to try and win, you always kind of feel a little disappointed afterwards. But at the same time, we said that all along in the Olympics, you've got some pretty good consolation prizes. 
I guess if you would have asked me before the week, I would have left here with a medal, I would have been pretty pleased and I managed to do that. I'm quite happy, I didn't feel like I played my absolute best throughout the week but I played good enough to put myself in contention and that was my goal. 
Once I was up there, I played pretty well, and you know, one or two shots better‑‑ I would have needed to play one or two shots better to win it today.
