Q.
Henrik, disappointing with the bogey coming towards the finish, but how do you feel about that one overall?
HENRIK STENSON:  No, I played well today and feel like should I have had a couple of shots better from this round today, but sometimes you can hit good shots and you can get    yeah, I don't know if you want to mention it, but you can get unlucky if you hit good shots.
Q.  How are the energy levels at the moment?  It's been an awful long week, hasn't it, I suppose?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, towards the end of the rounds here, I feel like I'm hitting good shots and they don't end up where they are supposed to and you get a little frustrated, and missed it in the rough on the last and tried to hack it out and it goes left further into the thick stuff.

Yeah, disappointing dropping two in the last three without playing too bad.  Just hopefully I get a few good breaks tomorrow instead.
Q.  It's still a big week for you, and a lot to play for for the end of the season.  Do you still see yourself with a chance of taking the Order of Merit?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, if I can finish this tournament off within the Top 3, maybe go and have a chance to win dunhill next week, I feel like I can be up there and challenge for the total.  I want to try and improve from last year and going to try my best the last couple of weeks.
Q.  What's this year done for you, and how do you now think it raises your expectation level?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I had a great start to the year and I could not quite follow it up during the spring and the early part of the summer.  And of course, I expect a lot from myself and my game, and when I didn't play that well, it's easy to be a bit frustrated and I think I've been coming back in good shape over the last couple of weeks now.
Q.  We've been talking to a couple of the guys today about it's coming towards the end of the season and Tiger has reestablished himself at the top of the world order, and guys like you and Adam Scott are expected to stand up and challenge Tiger.  Where are you in terms of doing that?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I still think I need to improve quite a bit, but if everything works out, I definitely feel like I can beat him in a 72 hole tournament and hopefully it will be in a major.
