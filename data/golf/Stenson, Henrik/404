   HENRIK STENSON:  I had some good putts today and I thought I was going to be able to close it out on 17 hopefully, but he made a good putt and I couldn't get up-and-down.  Took it to 18 and hit a great approach and it was done and over with pretty much.   
  
  Q.  10 of your 12 Accenture matches have come down to the last; it wouldn't be the same if you didn't come down to the last, would it?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  No.  That would feel weird.   
  
  Q.  How do you take on the world's No. 1 and the world's most dominant player head-to-head, 18 holes?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Hopefully I don't play 18 against him; I'll knock him out before that.  I'm really looking forward to the challenge.   
  
  Q.  Can you feed off the fact that you beat him in Dubai down the stretch 15 months ago?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, but he beat me a month ago in Dubai, so I don't know about that.  I'm just going to take on the challenge and I'm looking for it.   
  
  Q.  Congrats again.  The meat of this round for you was the four birdies from 8 through 11; would you agree?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I was 2-down there and won 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, five holes in a row.  So I turned it around.  And then hit a poor drive and he won 12.  So it was a little bit too close for comfort, but then I birdied 15, and I thought 3-up with three to go.  But he hit a great shot on 16, and I had to go for mine and kind of gave that one away a little bit.  Then I had a poor approach and he made a good putt on 17 so it was all down to the last again.   
  
  Q.  You've come out on top in a number of close matches here.  Does that give you an air of invincibility there?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Not at all.  I don't know, sometimes you start wondering how long it's going to last and if you take it up to the last hole every time.  But I've won four matches now and I've got Woods this afternoon, so that will be a challenge.   
  
  Q.  You've played ten matches on this golf course and you've won ten.  You're the only man in the field who's unbeaten ever on this golf course.  Are you going to carry that streak on this afternoon?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I'll try my very best.
