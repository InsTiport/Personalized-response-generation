  HENRIK STENSON: Tougher conditions out there today.  I thought I did a decent round.  And then just a bad putt, a couple of bogeys in the row.  That's never going to cheer you up too much.  A couple of bad breaks and a couple of bad shots.  A combination of that and getting a little frustrated over the mobile phones that keep on clicking out there.  That seems to be the hardest thing under the sun to turn off the sound on your mobile phone when you're on a golf tournament.  Give it another 15 years, and maybe everybody will learn.   Q.  Everybody says you have to make hay on the par 5s?  HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I guess I birdied 5, 10 and 18, so I guess I made three out of four, which is not bad today, especially not with 16 and 18 playing into the wind sort of.  It's a tougher wind, I think.  You're going to get -- probably only bad thing, time-wise in my round, that I dropped shots on holes that were playing short and kind of downwind, and didn't do too much bad on the tougher ones.  So that was a bit of a bummer.  But that's the way it went.  And hopefully can play better the next two days.
