  Q. Nice way to finish.   
 HENRIK STENSON: 2-under on the front, 3-under on the back. I had some chances and kind of felt like it slipped a way a little bit by making par on 13, but then I birdied 14 and had two good chances on 16 and 17 and couldn't make those. It was nice to make an important putt on the last.   
  
  Q. Do you think the tournament maybe got away from you yesterday with that run of bogeys you had?   
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, well, I actually felt like it was more like it was more this morning on the 18th, because I got it back and started the day with three birdies yesterday.   
 Today I got off to a great start, and then it I hit the second shot in the water for the second time during the week. So that's cost me four shots on the 18th.   
  
  Q. You have to be pretty pleased with your four days' work, though.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely. It's been a tiring week for everybody with fog delays and early mornings and so on. I played nine holes two days and 27 holes two days. Everybody is kind of exhausted now.   
 I've got three weeks off and then going to the match play. So I'll stay here for 2 1/2 weeks and then travel over to America. A bit of gym work for sure, and yeah, keep the golf going a little bit as well.  
  
  Q. Just looking ahead for the rest of the season, do you feel you're in good shape?  
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, absolutely. I've got some time to work on my game throughout the spring and obviously preparing for Augusta, and that's what I've got in mind at this point in time. Yeah, I have plenty of time to work on the game.  
 Rory is a fantastic player and I was out with him yesterday and today, and he was striking it really good.
