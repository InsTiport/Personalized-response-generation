Q.   Your first win ever the year, first ever successful defense of a title, how special that it comes here at the DP World Tour Championship?
HENRIK STENSON:   It feels great.   I'm exhausted to say the least.   Again, it was hot out there, and it was a tricky day.   On the back nine the wind picked up and I didn't play my best, and I had a shocking hole on 11 and that kind of put me back.   I didn't give up. 
I was hanging in there and made a couple important par putts on 12 and 16 I would say.   That kind of kept me in the ballgame and hit it to a foot on 17, and had a one‑shot cushion up the last there and hit a lovely pitching wedge that secured it.   Very pleased with that.

Q.   There's always a turning point; it came at 17.   Talk us through that tee shot.   
HENRIK STENSON:   I think what potentially was the par putt from 12 feet on 12, to hang in there after just made double on 11; then on 17, it was good numbers for a 5‑iron and I hit a nice shot pretty much straight at it coming in off the left and released up to a foot. 
It's a tough pin.   Rafa hit a pretty good shot just a hair left and his turns around and goes back down in the drink and make five.   That was tough for him and lucky for me there to get away with a birdie.   Left me a little bit easier up on 18.

Q.   You mentioned the tiredness.   Two behind with six to go, how deep did you have to dig?
HENRIK STENSON:   Just had to hang in there and wait for something to happen and it did luckily enough.   I've had a couple close calls this year to get my win and it wasn't to be earlier.   Match‑Play final, I lost out to Mikko and I was in a four‑man playoff in Germany and so on.   
So it's been close a couple of times.   Eventually you get something if you stick around, and I surely did that today so I'm very pleased with that.
