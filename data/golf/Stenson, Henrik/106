HENRIK STENSON: Didn't get off to a great start I would say.  I was 3-over par after ten.  But came back quite nicely.  I finished with I think five birdies in the last six holes, seven holes, something like that.
Yeah, I turned it around at least and yeah, I've got to be pretty pleased with the way we managed to play on the way home.
Q. Given your position relative to your challenges, what are your thoughts on The Race to Dubai at present?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I've just got to go out and try to play a solid round tomorrow.  I know if Alex finishes second on his own, I've got to be inside the top eight, so that's kind of the scenario that I'm trying to achieve.  Obviously it's a long way for me to be second on my own in case he were to win.  Yeah, I've just got to keep at it and try and play a good round tomorrow, finish off the week, and we can start counting afterwards.
