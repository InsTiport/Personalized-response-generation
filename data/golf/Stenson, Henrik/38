Q. How do you feel that went?
HENRIK STENSON: Well, I'm happy with the score.  I'm happy with a fighting performance.  I made three really good scrambling pars coming in 16, 17, 18, and made an up-and-down for birdie on 15 and made a long putt -- sorry, on 14.  Made a long birdie putt on 15.  I was 2-under the last five holes, and that by far is the best I could have ever been given how I played coming in.
So a couple of really wayward shots on the way home, and just happy to be able to scramble that and finish with three pars from those positions.  All in all, given the issues I had with my elbow and couldn't play in the Scottish last week, I feel like I'm behind on practise and playing and preparation.  So, yeah, just trying to do the best with what we have and what we can do, and we'll see where it takes us.  I think the conditions are going to bunch up the field enormously.  I think that's the case now when I finished up there.
I was 19th at minus 1 and 65th at plus 1.  So there's a lot of guys 1 under level par and 1 over.  That's just the way it is.  It's hard to get close to the pins.  Fairways are probably running quicker than the greens.  And the defence of the golf course without too much wind is tuck the pins away, and not really anyone can get close too many times.  It's a patience game.  Try to make one or two when you have a chance.  Or if you make a long putt and not make too many mistakes.
Q. How's the elbow?
HENRIK STENSON: Elbow is okay.  It's not 100 percent, but it's good enough to play, obviously.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be here this week.
