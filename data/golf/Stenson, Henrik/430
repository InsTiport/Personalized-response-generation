  Q.  You have to be happy with your position.   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, it's another tough day out there.  I didn't drive the ball as well as yesterday, and that put me in some trouble off the tee.  It's just tough from there on.  The wind was still pretty difficult and gusty, and you know, I just kept on fighting.  Obviously dropped a couple of shots that I didn't -- that I wouldn't have liked to do in the last couple of holes.   
 But still in decent shape for the weekend and hopefully it will be a better day tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  3 and 18 were playing as two of the toughest holes on TOUR yesterday.   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I think they did the same today.   
  
  Q.  Why did they play so tough?  I know the green on 3 is a little weird and you had a tough pitch today?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, if you go short on 3 you end up in the water on the right-hand side.  I guess there's a lot of balls finishing in the left, and same with 18.  A lot of times you slide off the fairway in that crosswind, and the rough from there on is just tough.   
 I had a so-so lie in the rough -- but then you have a 40-yard bunker shot down towards the water.  I had a good chance to save par, but it is definitely the most difficult so far on TOUR I would say.   
  
  Q.  How did the conditions compare to yesterday?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  No, it seemed like it's easier on the scoring, but it's still tough out there.  Especially like I didn't drive the ball as well as yesterday and you end up in some tough positions.  When you're playing downwind and you're coming out of the rough, you have no chance really to hold the green.   
 So that's the key.  Again, hit the fairways, hit the greens and give yourself chances.
