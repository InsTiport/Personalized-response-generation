Q.   Your stated goal was to get a faster start than the first two weeks of The Final Series.   You've done just that.   How good does it feel?
HENRIK STENSON:   It was good.   I got off to some good playing yesterday and I was in good position when we called it last night, and carried on today and made a couple of nice birdies coming in. 
Yeah, very happy with the score.   I'm taking one shot at a time.   The wrist is not in great shape, so it's one day at a time, one shot at a time.

Q.   Give us a sense of playing conditions compared to last evening when you played?
HENRIK STENSON:   There was more wind today.   It was kind of funny, I was a little bit inâ€‘between clubs on my second shot on 11 yesterday and today it was no question it was the longer one today when we came back.   It was a bit more wind, but a couple of the ones coming back in played shorter.   It's still soft and you can be attacking into the greens for sure.

Q.   You're playing out there with one of your closest contenders, Justin Rose; Ian Poulter has this bet with you; was his the first score you looked at when you came?
HENRIK STENSON:   I kind of knew he was playing all right, because he had the white towel around his arm showing me how I'm going to be looking when I'm pouring his drink.   So I'm trying my best to keep him behind me.
