 Q. You went out there, parred the first front nine both together, no one was really getting away from you, the course was playing a little tougher, and then we went to the 11th hole, run us by that 11th hole, please. 
 HENRIK STENSON: How much time do we got? I made a bad decision. I feel like the wind is kind of dying down a little bit. I'm in between 3 and 4 and I go for the 4. Obviously bad decision. 
 Hit it okay. Not perfect but it wasn't a bad shot, either. But I get hurt by the wind once it gets in front of the trees and come up short in the water. And I'm trying to hit it close on the next one and chunked it a bit and another one in the drink and then hit it by, and now I've got a putt for 7 down the hill and run that one by and miss the one coming back. 
 Yeah, that's really the only bad thing during this third round. I mean, I was playing not great, but not bad, either, on the front nine. Finished with three birdies. 

 Q. You finish with three birdies, very well done; how proud are you of the way you came back toward the end to get yourself back into the championship?
 HENRIK STENSON: Well, I mean, I was 4-over for the round, and made a tough up-and-down on 14. So I guess I could have ended up in an ambulance today and got it back with the birdies. Yeah, I'm still in position to have a good tournament, and I'm just going to go out there and try and attack tomorrow and hopefully a few extra ones will drop. 

 Q. You're five behind, what score do you feel as though you need to shoot around here tomorrow to win this championship once more?
 HENRIK STENSON: I don't know if it will be good enough to win it, but another one of those 64s would do fine right now.
