 Q.  I suspect that was a frustrating round for you? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Well, not so much frustrating, because I made some birdies out there but I am not feeling 100% confident with my long game. Off the tee I am struggling a little bit and having to hold back and hit a lot of three woods and Martin is obviously in good shape and ripping the driver down there so I was having to play first into the greens almost all the time. I also think I left myself too long an approach shot on a couple of occasions. 
 
 Q.  What was your mindset at the start of the day? 
 HENRIK STENSON: I just tried to go out there and tried to push him but it is kind of hard to try and get back on somebody who starts birdie, birdie. I just played pretty good on the front nine to make the gap a little smaller but then he finished strongly. I was trying to make up ground but then hit two or three wayward shots that cost me two bogeys coming in. But that is the name of the game when you are playing catch up but I will keep trying and if I can't win, I'll play for second place. 
 
 Q.  In fairness to Martin, he has been superb, hasn't he? 
 HENRIK STENSON: Yes, I think it has been a one man show this week so far and if he continues with a solid round tomorrow it is his tournament and I think he has made it pretty clear to all of that he wants this one. 
 
 Q.  How will you approach tomorrow? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  I will just go out there and try and play a solid round and see what happens.
