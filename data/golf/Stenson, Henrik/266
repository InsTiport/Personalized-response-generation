  HENRIK STENSON:   Pretty happy with the way I've played.   I've improved on my long game throughout the week.   I finished with some of the best shots of the week here on 17.   I had a lovely 4‑wood and set up an eagle on that hole and then on 18, I run through the fairway and had a pretty bad lie in the bunker.   Just had to splash it out and then I hit a super 3‑iron in the middle of the green and gave myself actually a birdie chance.   I would have taken par when I saw my lie off the tee shot.   
So you know, happy with that and it's just moving along nicely.   
   
 Q.   And you could wake up in the morning as world No. 1?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, we'll see, Adam is firing away, I'm sure he's not going to give it a for free.   It's a very bunched up field in the U.S., so he might as well end up winning that tournament.   So we'll just have to wait and see.  
   
 Q.   Home country next, looking forward to the Nordea Masters?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, it's going to be a good week.   It's going to bes busiest week in my entire golf career, but it's going to be good fun.   So I'm looking forward to it.
