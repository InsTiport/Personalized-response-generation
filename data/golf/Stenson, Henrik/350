   HENRICK STENSON: I felt a little bit better at 7:00, and threw a few pins in and went up. As soon as I tried to start to hit balls, it was an out-of-body experience.   
 It was no point, really. I mean, I was just slashing my arms up at the ball, worse than normally. No, it was just to get going. I conceded the match on the first green.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
HENRICK STENSON: I went to hit a couple of shots. It was not too much club on the ball on the first tee shot. I mean, I needed to get the shot in as well for my number of tournaments.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
HENRICK STENSON: The first tournament of the year in America didn't really turn out the way I had hoped.  
  
  Q. No, no. What does the doctor say?   
 HENRICK STENSON: Flu or virus or something like that. Like I said, I was just sleeping and drinking and staying in bed with fever all day yesterday.   
 I might make it back now, I've got two weeks off. I'm expecting a baby in a week's time. Make it back to the baby and hopefully not give them the flu and be back for the birth.  
  
  Q. So have you got a kid already or is it --  
 HENRICK STENSON: Yeah. This is the second one. We have a got a girl that is two years and eight months.  
  
  Q. Do you know what you're having?  
 HENRICK STENSON: No. It's a surprise. We're old-fashioned.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
HENRICK STENSON: To Orlando. The family is in Orlando.  
  
  Q. Fantastic.   
 HENRICK STENSON: We'll have it back there.  
  
  Q. What is the play schedule after this?  
 HENRICK STENSON: Doral will be the next one. It should be good. I should be good in five or six days or something like that. I should be hopefully be fully recovered.   
  
  Q. A big disappointment to come all this way especially with your record here?   
 HENRICK STENSON: Yeah, yeah, it was good, at least on the first course. I didn't play good here year. I got knocked out by Davis Love.   
 We'll try to make up for it next year.
