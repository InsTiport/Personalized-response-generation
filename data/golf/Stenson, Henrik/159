HENRIK STENSON: Knee is holding up pretty good.  It's been a challenge walking, as I said earlier in the week, and I'm not 100 percent, so I'm taking that decision to skip Qatar, even though it's a little sad, I played every one since I came out on Tour in 2001.
Yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint them not showing up next week, but I really feel like I need to get some rest and do some rehab more and hopefully be 100 per cent for Dubai.
Q. Given the aches and pains you're feeling, is it surprising you've contended as well as you have?
HENRIK STENSON: I haven't really been playing that good the first outing, the last couple years I missed the cut in Abu Dhabi which never feels good.  In that sense I was really happy with the first day and I putted well and hit some really good iron shots.  All in all, it's been a very good week in that sense, and yeah, the knee, it's not given me too much pain.  It just needs a bit more time to be 100 per cent.
Q. Did you feel that you had a chance, particularly on the back nine?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I needed to get going.  I really needed to do something special and yeah, I did what I could.  I made three birdies in the last four holes to post a score and yeah, the guys are just a little bit too far ahead I would say.
Q. The plan now, rest and recuperation?
HENRIK STENSON: Physio, rehab, some rest and some golf practice and hopefully I can play well in the Desert Classic in about a week's time.
