 Q.   With 14 pars in four birdies and 68 how would you assess your play today?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I'm striking it nicely today.   I would say I was back to hitting it really good and had quite a few chances, but wasn't as hot on the greens as I was yesterday.   Left a couple shots out there but all in all, I'll take that round, and still in the races.   Pleased with that.  
   
 Q.   You said yesterday you were virtually on fumes coming in from the 12th hole, how were you physically today?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I felt a little bit stronger today, which was good.   This morning when I woke up, I wasn't jumping out of bed, if I put it that way, but what do you expect at age 38.   I'm a little bit on the low side on energy but when the mind wants something, I'm sure we can pull through.  
   
 Q.   Had a great year, haven't won this year and you've never successfully defended a title.   What would it mean to you to do both tomorrow?  
HENRIK STENSON:   It would be great.   It's a great championship, this one, and of course that would mean a lot to me to defend, and to get a win this season.   It's still been a good one, but still at the end of the year when we assess it, we will always look at the trophies and there has not been any yet.   
We'll try and make it happen, but there are a lot of strong players out there and Rafa seems to be on fire.   We'll see if we can hold him off tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Not easy to go around the Earth Course and avoid bogeys, and you did.   Do you feel like you had enough birdies?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I left a couple shots out there.   I played solid today tee‑to‑green.   I was more happy with my striking than yesterday, but the flat stick wasn't behaving as good, and I definitely left a couple out there, especially a clumsy 3‑putt on the second after two really good shots in there.   I had about a 25‑footer or something, or not even, 20‑footer for eagle and walked away with a par.   
That was not the best of starts but then I made a good par save on 3 and pitched in on 4 which is a tough hole.   So, yeah, I left a couple, the birdie putt on 7, as well.   Missed about a 4‑footer with a lot of break on there.   I left a few out there but all in all I'm pretty pleased with that performance.  
   
 Q.   Scores are higher this year than previous years.   Why is that in your opinion?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I don't have a good answer to be honest.   It might be a little bit more wind at times, but I guess everyone's just a little bit worse this year than last year.   
The course has been playing pretty much the same.   If anything else we have less rough than we had last year, and everything else is pretty much the same.   So I've got no good answer for you.   
   
 Q.   We have 18 holes to play; for you to get a victory here, what would it mean?  
HENRIK STENSON:   It would be very pleasing.   It's been a solid year, but I haven't got a trophy yet, so that would really rack it up and make me go on the Christmas break with a very positive feeling.   Still a lot of golf to play, and Rafa, he's had two 65s or something like that in the last two rounds, so he seems to be on fire so he's going to be a tough match tomorrow.   Still a bunch of guys two, three, four shots behind that could get on a hot streak and catch us.   
So a lot of golf to play and got to stick to my bits and see if it's good enough.   It's been a solid year for me and I haven't managed to get a win in.   It would mean a lot to get a win here and defend my title.   Going to try my hardest, and still a lot of good golf to be played and a lot of good players to try and hold off, but we'll give it a go.
