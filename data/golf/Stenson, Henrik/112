Q. 69 today, what are your thoughts on that round?
HENRIK STENSON: Very pleased.  It was below average on the front nine and hit a good shot into 8 and drained a nice birdie putt on 9 to turn in red figures, but it was a struggle on the front nine.  I hit it nicely on the back nine and rounded with some good birdies on 15, 16, 17 and a good par save on last.  Very happy with that round.
Q. Conditions pretty tough out there?  The wind can be a real problem and looked like in the front end that was the case.  Was that true?
HENRIK STENSON: It was blowing a bit harder than it normally does.  And you would like to think that it should be easy to predict where the wind it, but it swirls just as much but more of it.
It is a tricky golf course.  We're playing in altitude, and if you don't get it right, it can easily go away from you.  I was hanging in there and got rewarded for my patience and a couple good shots coming in.
Q. Your challenge for The Race to Dubai in The Final Series, your thoughts on that?  Take care of business this week?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, that would be nice.  Just want to play as well as I can for these two weeks and see where it takes me.
Of course you're always going to look a little bit and see what the other guys are doing but at the end of the day I've got to focus on my game and I managed to do that.  So happy with the day's work.
Q. Do you take a lot of satisfaction in getting your reward in the end?
HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely.  It was a tough day out there and I didn't play well.  No one in the group played particularly well on the front nine and it was a struggle.   The wind was pretty strong today and it swirls as it always does around here.
I don't know how your game -- we're playing down in a bit of a bowl, so that's what makes it swirl I guess.  But it was tough conditions, and I kept my patience.  Hit a good shot on and 8, a nice putt on 9 to pick up a couple of birdies there, and then I was actually playing better on the back nine.  It wasn't an easy day, so I'm happy with the score.
Q. You have recorded a terrific low score in your victory here; do you see that at all this year?
HENRIK STENSON: I guess at night at least you can dream about it, shooting 63s out there.  I don't think there was anywhere close to 63 today.  It's tough.  You just have to manage your way around the golf course.  There's a couple of really intimidating tee shots and I managed to keep it on the short stuff most of the day and yeah, kept it together in tough conditions.
Q. Do you admire the design of the course for having that sort of situation?
HENRIK STENSON: I don't think I can give Gary credit for the swirling winds, but it's a nice golf course.  I always enjoy playing this one, and it's a course where you can play it fairly easy as a resort course if you widen the fairways and put the pins in the middle.  But as soon as you bring the rough in and put the pins out in those corner positions, then it's a different ballgame.  So it's great design, really.
