Q. Henrik, good solid start to the day.  Great up-and-down on 18 as well.HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I made some nice up-and-downs out there.  I'm very happy with the day.  There was a lot of positives out there.  Hit some really nice tee balls, which I was very pleased with, and some good long irons.  Putting was solid, and some really nice up and downs.  Couple of bunker shots led to up-and-downs, and some nice pitches on the green. The only thing I would say is I blew three or four good chances with wedges from the middle of the fairway, and I didn't really put them in close.  That's the only negative, but a lot of positives.Q. Heard a little conversation today about players saying some greens playing a little firm, some playing softer than others, having difficulties trying to guess what the first bounce was going to do.  Did you find that out there at all?HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, in the practice round yesterday, I felt the course was definitely firmer than we've seen in other years.  I actually expected it to be a bit firmer early on, but it was a bit more receptive on the front nine.  When I hit my approach on 10, I felt like it was a bit firmer, and that seemed to be the case all the way around. There wasn't too much guessing, but it definitely firmed up as the sun came out.  The later the day went, it was firming up for sure.  You've got to get it a bit adjusted for that.Q. Solid opening round.  Good luck the rest of the way.HENRIK STENSON: Thank you.
