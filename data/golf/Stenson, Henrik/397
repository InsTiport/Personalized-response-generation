 Q. How tough is the golf course playing today?
 HENRIK STENSON: Well, I mean it's blowing a little bit out there. It's firming up both the fairways and the greens. And it's very difficult to get it close. The pins aren't too easy either. So it's tough to shoot a good number today. 

 Q. But you did shoot a good number?
 HENRIK STENSON: I did. But I mean a really low one is going to be really tough. So I was just fighting for par on the back nine, my front nine and then I managed to hit a couple of those shots close on the front nine and made three birdies and a double bogey on the front nine and I hit a flier out of the left hand there and down over the green and I was happy with a bogey after that.

 Q. Can you get aggressive on this golf course at all?
 HENRIK STENSON: On a few holes, I guess, but when it's firming out it's going to be very hard to get close to the pins. 
 And then, as I said, they tucked them away sort of behind these little humps and ridges so it's almost better to come in at the angle that's on the same level.
