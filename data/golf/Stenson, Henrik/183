 Q.  Only one blemish on the card, one bogey today.  What was going so well for you today?  
HENRIK STENSON: I think I played okay.  Feel like I could have been a little more fortunate on the greens.  Had a great putt on 15 that I was walking off and then kind of nudged out.  Had a pretty good chance on 16, too, but I got my reward on 17.   
So all in all, I was playing quite nicely.  A couple of wild tee shots, but overall, a fairly solid day.  Was a little bit of a grind at times but kept it together and shot 3-under.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you left any shots out there today, and if so, how many do you think?  
HENRIK STENSON: It's always one or two, especially on those birdie chances on 15 or 16, I thought I had at least one on those two.  Would have been nice to finish with a 3 on 18, but I think on television, you can't see how hard those chip shots are.  You are always nestled down in that rough and undulating greens, you can barely touch the putts whenever you get above the hole.   
You're going to leave a few putts out there because you have 5-, 6-footers down the hill with one, two, three-foot of break, so you're not going to make as many as you normally do.  All in all I'm pretty happy with the way I'm playing and I guess I'm two back for tomorrow.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you, two back for tomorrow, what are you looking forward to most?  
HENRIK STENSON: I've got to go out and do more of the same and hopefully drain a couple of putts and make some birdies because it's definitely heading that way on the leaderboard.  Anything is possible if you get going, so I'm happy with the way the week is going so far, and we'll try and make up some ground tomorrow.
