 Q.  Extraordinary summer for you continues, not only a major championship, but an Olympic medal and now the first point on the board for the European team.  You went out early, all points are equal, but was there more pressure on you because you knew your captain had front loaded?  
HENRIK STENSON: We needed to get some blue on the board early.  It's kind of going that way.  Hopefully the other guys can turn things around.  Still a lot of golf to be played.  I'm very pleased with my performance.  I played some excellent golf today.   
And Jordan is a very tough guy to meet.  He didn't play great yesterday afternoon, but he came out with a good game today.  It was a good match and very happy to come out on top.
