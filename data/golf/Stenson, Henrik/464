Q.
What was the difference between the first two rounds and today?
HENRIK STENSON:  I think I tried to be cute on the first.  I hit a good tee ball and ended up just short with a sand iron in the bunker for a bogey and 3 putted on 4 with a pretty difficult first putt.

Overall after 4, it didn't feel like a great start.  Hit a fantastic shot on 5 and then just missed on the next and dropped one again.  The shots that I missed, sort of took a bogey on those ones and didn't quite take the opportunity.  It didn't feel like I played that bad.  Just didn't get it all together today and I fought hard and came back with a couple of birdies at the end.

I'm not happy with the score, 73 is not    good day tomorrow and I can have a very good championship anyway.
Q.  2 under through last five holes, does that give you momentum?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, just got to go out there and try to shoot a low number, and hopefully come back in the Top 10, Top 5, something like that.  It's a new day tomorrow.
