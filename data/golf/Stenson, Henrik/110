Q. A Top-10 finish, what's your verdict on this week and the way it shapes for next?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with that.  I felt like my swing had more moving parts than my Swiss watch, my Audemars.
So I was fighting the long game this week, and I think I did pretty good despite that.  So pretty happy with that.
And you know, it was funny, sometimes you just can get that feeling.  Alex rolled in from 30 feet on the first, a big slinger, and got a good notch on the second, almost made eagle and kept on playing solid and making those putts.  It felt like he was on fire today, and no one's really going to be able to touch him.  Well done to him, all the credit and he's definitely in there in the mix for the last week.
Q. Next week?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I mean, Danny's always going to have a chance, I'm going to have a chance, and Alex, and I don't know if there's anyone really that has a chance going into last week.  I'm pretty pleased with that.
Of course, with Alex playing as well as he does, just motivates me even more to bring my game next week and then try and be up there.
