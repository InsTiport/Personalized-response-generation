 Q.  (No microphone)?  
HENRIK STENSON: Try and tap it down there with nice speed and standing back there and watched it, I kind of walked down the path.  I have a tendency to do that at times.  I didn't want it to stop.  I wanted it to roll up and it did for a couple of minutes.  You don't expect to see too many 2s on hole No. 8 today, right?   
 Q.  Henrik, can you speak to how the conditions perhaps changed throughout your round and how they may change throughout the weekend here?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's been, as you know, with the weather, it's changed.  Everyone has been prepping for a good three, four days where to land it, 30, 40 feet short of the hole.  All of a sudden, you can be quite attacking if you go through the yardages with the shorter clubs in your hands.  On a few of them, you even had to watch your spin.   
The course has changed, but as we played our round, it's dried out a little bit.  Sunshine and a little breeze.   
It wasn't super easy out there.  You never expect it to be.  It's definitely getting firmer.  If we keep this weather for the next couple of days, I would imagine we're getting closer and closer to what we saw early in the week, wicked putts and firm little bounces on the greens.
