Q.   Henrik, how good is 68 to start?
HENRIK STENSON:   I guess it's the best round of the year.   No, it was a good day for me.   I was striking the ball quite nicely.   I felt that yesterday I was starting to get things in the right direction, and it was a good day striking‑wise, a little frustrating on the scoring side.   I felt like I left a couple of chances out there, and then after being 3‑under in the middle of my back nine, then I 3‑putted from, I don't know, 20 feet.   I thought it was uphill but I don't think it was.
You know, hit it quite far by and missed the one coming back and was in trouble on the next but made a good 8‑footer to save par on the sixth and then finishing with birdie on 8 and 9.   So, you know, that kind of turned things around.   So it always feels good coming off the course with two straight birdies.   In very good shape and work‑in‑progress.

Q.   We touched on this in all the build up but presumably the familiarity, you just know it so well. 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I know the course really well but these greens are tricky.   There's a lot of grain on them and they can really, really play with your mind a little bit.   Luke missed a putt from about one foot and I mean, you wouldn't see that happen otherwise.   If you hit a poor putt at the wrong time, you know you can miss from really short range on grainy greens, and they are a bit tricky to make a lot of putts, at least for me, but it seems like some of the other guys didn't find it that way.

Q.   Did you find the greens any different, because they have been re‑laid?
HENRIK STENSON:   No, I didn't even know that.   But they are firm and I like that so they are definitely firmer than they have been in the past and like I said, the course is in really good shape.   The fairways seem to be a bit softer than when I played on Monday, so I don't know if they putt a little bit of water on them.   But the course is in good shape and I like firm greens, so bring it on.
