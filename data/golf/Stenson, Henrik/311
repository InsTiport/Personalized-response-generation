 Q.   Another good solid tournament for you.   What a big birdie at 17.   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, it was nice.   I mean, I played nicely today.   I had a bad break on 3.   It was a weird hole for me.   I hit the fairway but a little bit short and right, so I was stymied.   I chipped it forward, a lovely pitch, one bounce, hit the pin, very much like Tiger at Augusta and came back down in the rough there and hit a lovely chip, thought I made that one and ended up with a bogey.   
You know, I had some chances but didn't hit great putts on the front nine.   I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, played solid, and eventually I managed to crack the par streak on 17 with a solid birdie and a good twoâ€‘putt on the last to keep tied second.   Yeah, very pleased with the week.   It was obviously nothing to do against Tiger playing the way he did.   He kind of punctured this tournament on Friday for sure.   He did what he needed to do today, and I'm pleased with the way I played.  
   
 Q.   A lot of momentum for you headed to the PGA Championship.   Your game is at a level where you have to feel confident you can win?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, definitely.   I played well in Scotland.   I did really well at the Open.   I was one of the guys in the mix there, and I feel comfortable.   I've been out in the last group two times out of the last three weeks I've played, and at the Open I was second, also.   I'm getting used to being out last and playing well.   Yeah, I'm looking forward to next week.
