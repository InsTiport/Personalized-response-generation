HENRIK STENSON: It was nice, no dropped shots and still hit a lot of greens and made a few putts and kept it together nicely.  So yeah, hopefully not super, super far behind going into Sunday but we'll certainly need another good round tomorrow to have any chance.   
 Q.  What made the difference compared to two more modest rounds?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I just probably took more advantage of the par 5s today and made one or two putts, and again hit a couple close like I did the first day.  First round was pretty good playing actually, but I was 1-over on the four par 5s.  If you shoot 4-under with those par 5, you know it could have been easily 6- or 7-under.  Took better advantage of those today and played quite nicely.   
 Q.  Patrick Reed said the two of you fed off each other.  Is that the case?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, we were kind of throwing purges at each other, birdies there on the back nine and he made a couple on the front there, and then we both birdied 10, both birdied 11.  He birdied 12.  I birdied 13.  He birdied 14.  I birdied 15.  Then he birdied 18, so I guess so, yeah.   
 Q.  You've touched on this but what do you fancy is necessary come the final day?  Admittedly we don't know what the leaders will shoot just yet.  
HENRIK STENSON: To have any chance, given similar conditions tomorrow, I need to shoot 7- or 8-under I think again to get it close to 20 I think to have a chance.  Given where I'm at in The Race to Dubai standings, pretty much need win, win to have a chance.  Yeah, we'll just have to try and go at it again tomorrow.   
 Q.  Feeling good about that possibility with your history in Dubai quite clearly?  
HENRIK STENSON: If I could get it done this week, I definitely fancy the chances.  Still a long ways to go and I need to play some really solid golf tomorrow to have a chance but we'll give it a try.
