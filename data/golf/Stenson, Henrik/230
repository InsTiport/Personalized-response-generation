Q.   Having gone 3‑up with five to play, Jonas came back at you and went right to the wire. 
HENRIK STENSON:   Everyone comes back at me.   Same with Thongchai yesterday.   No one let's me have an easy finish here, which you kind of expect that but not every time.   He definitely pushed an old man all the way to the last there and made it very interesting.
It was a good match.   I was up most of the way, one and 2‑up and he just came back with some good birdies and put some pressure on me coming in the last couple holes for sure.

Q.   Were 10 and 11 key?   Always nice to get back‑to‑back holes in match play, isn't it? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, got to 3‑up and then parred the next couple.   And then he made a 25‑, 30‑footer for birdie on 14 and I missed my tee shot and had to lay up on 15. 
So that was the one I felt like I invited him a little bit too much.   And then I had to scramble I guess on 16 to save par and he's a very strong putter, I know that.   I expect him to drain a couple of bombs out there, and he certainly did the same on 8 and on 14. 

Q.   I think I'm right in saying this is the furthest you've come in this competition.   Your thoughts on a potential semifinal tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, at least when Volvo HAS been sponsoring, I think I was third in my first one in 2008.   I'm kind of up there.   Yeah, just have to go out and play well again tomorrow.   You never know if the form of the guy you're playing against is going to be on.   You just have to focus on your own game.
