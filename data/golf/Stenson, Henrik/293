Q.   Henrik, congratulations.   Well played all week long.   You really stuck in there, and, of course, you finished it off nicely.   How was it out there on the golf course for you? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, I mean, it was a tough day, absolutely.   I mean, especially with so many things going on at the same time here. 
I kind of knew, well, even if I don't win today, I could still win the FedExCup.   Do you want to focus on that?   At the end of the day, it was all about going out there and trying my best and try to win this golf tournament because then I knew I was going to leave with two trophies. 
That was the hard bit to put everything aside, as always, and focus on the right things.   I didn't play my best round today, but I was hanging in there, took the right decisions. 
The only problem really was on 14, when I hit it over the back of the green with a flier, which is the only place I shouldn't go.   Other than that, I was hanging in there tough and making the saves when I needed to.   Made a couple of nice birdies. 
So I was very, very pleased with the way I was performing today.

Q.   You were number one in ball striking on the Tour this year.   That certainly has led to these victories in the last month or so.   It's been spectacular play. 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I mean, this run that I've had since the Scottish has been unbelievably solid and consistent. 
I want to thank my team, my caddie Gareth, my physio Cornel, my swing coach Pete and my other coach Torsten for sticking with me.   Without them, I wouldn't have done that.

Q.   When you fell to the lowest part, could you ever imagine coming back to this point in your career? 
HENRIK STENSON:   This is obviously the highest of everything, to win the FedExCup and win the TOUR Championship and win the Deutsche Bank two weeks ago. 
It's been unbelievable.   Yeah, it's kind of sinking in more and more.   To come back, that's what pays off, the hard work.

Q.   Thanks for your time.   Congratulations on both wins.   The TOUR Championship and the FedExCup. 
HENRIK STENSON:   Thank you very much.   Thank you.
