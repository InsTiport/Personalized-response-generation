  HENRIK STENSON:     Yeah, it was bit of a weird day or slow day for me.   I got off to the great start, eagled the 1st, hit a 4-wood out of the rough and drained a 25-footer down the hill, and three-putted the 2nd.   Lot of grinding for par.   
It was blowing pretty hard there and got to hit some good shots and hit the greens.   Never got back close to the hole and then got off to a good finish here on 18, made a good shot out of the bunker and middle a nice putt.   
So, stayed patient and didn't play great but was good.  
   
 Q.   With the breeze today, how did you balance aggressiveness with being conservative in spots out there.   It was really kind of weird to figure the whole thing out.  
HENRIK STENSON:   I still try to hit my spots, the ones I tried to hit yesterday and left longer clubs into the green when you're playing into the wind.   Not too many holes where you can be more aggressive really in terms of the strategy.   
I hit a drive on 9 yesterday and went with the drive and put myself down in the tree and ended up making bogey.   That didn't work out.   I didn't get it close enough to give myself too many birdies.   All in all, pretty pleased.  
   
 Q.   Second round on this course.   Have you learned anything to take to the weekend?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I just need to play a little bit better.   I'm still in a good spot and still in contention.   So, if I can up my game a little bit and keep on following the same plan and stay patient and make a few putts, I hope to be there on Sunday.
