Q.   How would you assess your mood right now after round three here? 
HENRIK STENSON:   It's kind of pretty stable.   I would have liked to finish a bit better.   I hit in the water on 16.   Didn't hit a good tee shot there and made five.   Then hit a great putt on 17, just snuck by. 
18 is a tough piece of the green, that addition on the right‑hand side.   It slopes all the way straight into the water, so I hit it from, I don't know, 50 feet, 60 feet.   I left it about six feet short but if I do the same and go past it's probably in the water.   It's a bit of a tricky one.   You're going to see a lot of first putts left short.   Yeah, I would have liked to finish a bit better but it's all right. 

Q.   What now looking at the leaderboard?   What do you think your position is heading into Sunday as it stands at the minute?
HENRIK STENSON:   I'm going to be as many behind as I was.   I started the day at 69, and I imagine that 69 holds you in the same position at best.   It's soft out there.   It's a lot of birdies around if you're playing well. 
Yeah, in terms of chances, I don't think I'm playing well enough and I'm probably going to be too far behind.   So I'll go practice and look at it tomorrow and what's beyond that.

Q.   Just on the tee, mental and physical from last week, how are you holding up?   It was a draining one, wasn't it? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, but it wasn't too bad in the end for me anyway.   I felt quite fresh when I left.   You always feel a bit beaten up when you lead a U.S. Open.   That's normal.   But it's more the jet‑lag.   Nine hours takes a few days to get over so sleeping has not been the best the first part of the week but we are getting there and we are back in Europe at least for five weeks, so I should be all right from here on.
