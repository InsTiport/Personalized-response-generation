Q. Your thoughts on that opening round?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm pretty pleased with it.  I didn't play my best but I putted nicely.  Made a couple of important par putts in the middle of my front nine, and then picked up some shots on the par 5s where you expect to do it.  Kept it tidy.  No dropped shots.  Hit a couple of good iron shots towards the end there that didn't quite get the reward for, but all in all, I think it was a decent start.
Q. Very decent, and it might look even more decent if this weather continues to come in.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, a funny change in temperature.  There were a couple of holes left and it started to go a bit grey in the sky and then it cleared up and got hot again.
Yeah, I think that wind is on the turn, and by the sounds of it, we're going to see some proper wind tomorrow, and maybe this afternoon.  Definitely important to get a decent round in.
Q. What aspect of your game are you most pleased with to take into the next three days?
HENRIK STENSON: My putting, for sure.  I've worked a lot on my putting and I've worked on my long game, as well.  I just didn't feel that comfortable with some of the things I'm working on.  Back to the range after lunch and hit a few shots and hopefully we'll hit it better tomorrow.
