 Q.   8‑under par for your last nine holes, what was that like to be part of?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I had a rocky start.   I gave away a couple of early gifts and I was 3‑down through four and when we were talking so much about getting off to a quick start and being up early, that wasn't really what I was planning.   I didn't give up obviously so I was grinding it out and started playing better and better and made some nice putts today.   
Yeah, I was 7‑ or 8‑under from nine onwards.   Yeah, another good day out there especially considering I haven't touched a club basically for two weeks coming here.   Yeah, I'll take that.   
   
 Q.   The ninth hole was key, he hit close it the hole, he's 2‑up and you have to make a birdie and you came up with a great second shot.   Describe that one?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I felt like I had a slight advantage hitting a good tee ball.   I was about 30, 35 yards ahead of him and he had a rescue and I'm standing there with a three‑quarter 6‑iron and he hits a great shot in there, of course.   That always happens when you're thinking like that.   And then I just played a lovely 6‑iron.   I don't know, did it even touch the flag, that one?   Because I had a bit of paint on the ball when I came to the 10th.   I think it was nudging the flagstick.  
   
 Q.   How satisfying to produce those shots when you have to?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I felt like I was playing better and better as the round went on.   Yeah, it was a really nice 4‑iron into 14.   He had about a 5‑, 6‑footer for birdie‑‑ on 15.   I just figured yesterday I didn't take my chances against George when I had them.   Today I felt I needed to take them and rolled some nice putts in to close out the match, so that was very satisfying.
