Q. Difficult conditions.  Can you talk about how bad it was out there?
HENRIK STENSON: It was definitely the worst conditions I've ever played golf in in Dubai; I know that much.  It was blowing very hard, a lot of dust in the air, trees coming down.  Feels a lot calmer right now, though.  But yeah, can't control the weather, unfortunately, and we'll be back to play some more golf tomorrow.
Q. I know there were concerns of the ball moving on the green because of dust and wind.  Did that come up at all?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I believe there were balls moving on the greens at certain places.  Sergio's ball on the fifth green started moving around a little bit, I believe.  Yeah, there were occasions like that, too.
Q. With the news that Tiger Woods withdrew this morning; is there a part of you, the competitor, that is disappointed he won't play the rest of the week?
HENRIK STENSON: Well, I think with the start he had, I think he had a lot of work to do to play the rest of the week all the way.  Again, it's a question of him being healthy.  I mean, if he's going to be out here playing, you've got to be 100 percent.  Once again, he needs to take care of his injuries obviously.
