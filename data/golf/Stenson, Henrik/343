   HENRIK STENSON: I would have liked to finish with a birdie on 18 there, but it just snuck out.  
  
  Q. Was the putter the difference between yesterday's round and today's round?  
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I would say so. I actually hit it better today but I didn't make those shots and actually I had a couple of bonus ones yesterday.  
  
  Q. Was it kind of tough knowing that there was a large hill to climb going into the final round?  
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, Louis has been playing great, and it's only been one player out there this week. You know, I was trying my hardest, didn't get it going. Then it's more about playing a solid round and taking it to the finish, which I did hit some really nice shots. I'm happy with the way I played.  
  
  Q. What can you take away from this week?  
 HENRIK STENSON: I mean, even though I'm not feeling 100 per cent up to speed and confident, I still performed really well in a big championship. I obviously don't need to play my best to be somewhat a contender in a big major.
