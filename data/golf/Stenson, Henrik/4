Q. Level par 72. Just give us your verdict on that one?
HENRIK STENSON: I think overall, it's certainly not a bad score out there. It's one of the tougher mornings in later years we've had to play here at Emirates Golf Club. It's blowing pretty hard, and the course setup is certainly tougher this year. I think Bryson put everyone off last year with 24-under or something. They won't have that one more time.
So thick rough, firm fairways, breezy conditions. As you know, a lot of doglegs on this golf course and you're coming in sideways from the fairway. A lot of good shots ended up in the rough and I think a lot of players will play from the rough today.
Q. How important is the right attitude when the golf course is this difficult and conditions are that testing?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, you've got to dig deep, no question. Other than a little bit of a mishap here on the third-last hole, I was staying patient. I was doing my things, and grinding it out when I needed to and made a couple of good birdies in between. I just kept on fighting. Pleased with the day's performance overall.
Q. Your first win in a little while, just before Christmas in December. How valuable in terms of belief and confidence was that victory?
HENRIK STENSON: That was huge. I didn't really have any great chances or any chances at all to win tournaments last year. To be in the mix and when you're up against players like Jon and Tiger and Justin Thomas and Gary Woodland, it's pretty hard to win any tournament, but when you have four or five of those guys right around you, it's never easy. So I was super happy with that and it was a great way to finish the season and go on a break, and yeah, we still need to pick up some pace. We couldn't quite start up the year where we left it last year, but still early doors. I've got patience; you know that.
