  Q. Commiserations Henrik, it was a real battle, but what was it that gave Ernie the edge?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  In the morning I was one-up but I feel I gave him a couple of free holes in the morning. I couldn't quite find the same good feelings I had yesterday and had a problem with my ball striking today. I hit a few bad shots. I felt I gave those free holes away and then he came out really strong this afternoon and putted great this afternoon. He made 3 birdies on the front nine that I couldn't match so he got it back to 2-up. It took him 25 holes to get ahead.   
 Then it was 3-up and I came back real hard. He was hanging on for dear life at the end, a couple of times with the putter. I felt like if he caved in on one or two of them that I could have taken it down the last few holes, but he just made some fantastic putts, and I never got the chance.  Especially on 11, 13, 16. He was in the sand in 11 but got up and down, escaped the ditch on 13 and got up and down, 16 as well. I had an unfortunate lie off 15 in the bunker as well, because he was in trouble, and I had a great chance to get that hole back, but ended up losing the hole.   
 That's match play. He fought really well and I wish him well in the final. It's going to be a great one against Angel.
