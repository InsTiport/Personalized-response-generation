 Q.  You were really firing on that front nine.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I really got off to a fast start.  I watched the scorecard up in the clubhouse here from when I played in 2006, I started with five straight birdies and I thought, that would be nice.   
I made five in the first six.  Got off to a flying start.  It's moving day.  It's all that I wanted.  But it kind of stalled a little bit on the back nine.  Didn't keep it going as well.   
A slight bit of disappointment to the finishing better than 5-under, given that I was 6-under through eight, but still, a good day.  I played a lot better and gave myself some good chances.   
 Q.  Played a lot better, how come?  What was it that made the difference?  
HENRIK STENSON: I was putting really well the first to days, and I just found my rhythm and the path with the striking.  I hit some quality shots out there and set up a lot of birdie chances.  That was really the difference, but I didn't keep it going unfortunately all the way to the finish, but there's a day tomorrow, as well.   
 Q.  You mentioned 2006.  It's similar to last year, as well, when you really moved sweetly on Saturday and put yourself a good finish.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, we try to move up when we have the chance.  Preferably I would have liked to have a quicker start in the week, but you can only do so much at a time, I guess, and yeah, I'm happy with the way it's going.   
 Q.  One more day to come.  What are you reckoning when you look at that leaderboard now?  
HENRIK STENSON: I would have liked to be a couple of two, three, shots closer for sure.  But it's never over until it's over.  So there's been some good scores put out at this course in the past.  If we can have another good day tomorrow, we'll see where it takes us.
