   HENRIK STENSON: It was quite a gray day out there and my game didn't light it up too much either especially on the front nine. I was 3-over, a couple of mistakes and didn't get anything going.   
 On the back nine I scored a bit better at least and managed to make a few birdies, and chances snuck by on 15, 16.   
 And 18 was playing ridiculously tough today. I think players would not be too happy with the tee box all the way back and therefore 50 metres into the rain, it was a lot of woods coming in. I tried to squeeze a 3-iron up and didn't even reach on 18, and just missed the putt for par and made bogey.   
 If you don't touch that one today, I don't think you should ever touch any tee box never again really.   
  
  Q. You're still in it, aren't you?   
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm 2-under, hopefully can have a good day tomorrow. Seems likes it's going to be a tough two more days I think from what I've heard about the weather.   
 Yeah, I just hope I can get something going. Obviously I'm quite far back, but a good round might make up some ground tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Can you get into a mind with the wind and just battle?   
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, but like, I said I made one or two mistakes with short clubs and hit a flyer on one hole and just missed it a little bit.   
 I haven't played the course enough, either, when the conditions were totally opposite the wind, the course played quite different, and I felt got caught up with that on a few occasions; and hitting long clubs off the tee and you are not quite sure what's over that mound or whatever when you hit it. And a couple more rounds in kind of gives you a better feel for the course. Hopefully we can use that tomorrow a little bit.
