 Q.   Down early in this one.   What is your reaction when you are three down heading to the fifth tee?  
HENRIK STENSON:   It's not good.   I didn't play particularly well.   And I had a couple of chances to get one or two back, but Lou made some really good putts when he needed to from 10, 12 feet on a couple of occasions, so that kind of kept him going.   
Yeah, now we're going home.  
   
 Q.   When you find yourself behind the eight ball that quickly, what adjustments do you try to make or how much more aggressive do you try to get?   
HENRIK STENSON:   I mean, like I said yesterday, it's not a course where you can play some defensively because you get some really funky putts and the greens are really funky.   You just try and hit it close.   Sometimes the greens were soft.   Sometimes they were hard.  
I don't know how it looks on television, but I hit a good shotinto 17 and ‑‑ sorry, 12, landed about six feet short and it ricocheted up in the grandstand behind.   So it's kind of a bit of a (indiscernible) how the ball is going to react when it lands at times.
