  HENRIK STENSON:   Pleased to close the week that way.   I played pretty solid tee‑to‑green today.   I missed on a couple occasions, but then the putter was behaving.   So all in all a well‑played round.

Q.   What got it going, birdie after birdie, did you fancy your chance to be right up the top?
HENRIK STENSON:   Not quite.   I think I always felt like I was a bit too far behind, but you never know.   I needed possibly an eagle on the back nine or a couple more birdies. 
When you are chasing from so far behind, I couldn't afford any mistakes and unfortunately I missed the fairway on 12 and dropped one there, but got it right back with three straight birdies and finished with a good one here on the last. 
I'll take that.   I think it was too easy scoring today to be able to do something from six behind.

Q.   Good for next week and Race to Dubai and the rankings and pushing up and things like that?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, you normally don't go backwards if you shoot 64 the last day, which I presume I didn't do this time either.   Yeah, there should be some World Ranking points, some points on the list and should be in a decent place coming into the last event.

Q.   Feeling good in general terms? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, putting was the one thing that didn't work the first couple days for me.   I made a couple but I missed too many short‑range chances.   I felt like I left ten shots combined in the first three rounds and if you want to be up there and fight for the trophy, you can't really afford that. 
I think at the end of the week I probably played good enough to win but the putter wasn't behaving the first couple of days to give me a chance.
