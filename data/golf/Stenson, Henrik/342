  Q. Henrik, 67, 67. Pretty solid. I looked on the stats, 51 putts for two rounds. Making a few putts and getting it up and down.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Short game has been unbelievable. I'd say -- I mean, I'm playing better, but it is definitely the short game that has got me going and I think Sevi would have been proud if he watched me.   
  
  Q. You hit quite a few fairways, 75% of the fairways, 66% of the greens. Irons are something you are going to need to work on for the weekend. If the putter stays hot, look out.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I am just taking one shot at a time. I'm coming off some bad tournaments and trying to find my way back here towards the end of the season.   
 Felt a little bit better. So, I mean, I'm at least enjoying myself now. I haven't been there for a couple of weeks.  
  
  Q. After the British Open, you were sick -- really sick, weren't you, at -- was it at Bridgestone and had a tough time at the PGA also?  
 HENRIK STENSON: I was ill for, like, eight weeks in total, with flu and chest infection and stuff. And I still tried to play. Got a minimum number of tournaments I had to play as well. There was some tough times.  
 And last couple of weeks, I have been struggling.  
  
  Q. Get the irons figured out. Have fun on the weekend.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Thank you.
