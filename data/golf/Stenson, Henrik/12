 Q.  Any round without a bogey is satisfying.  How about one that had six birdies in it, as well?  
HENRIK STENSON: It's definitely better than 18 pars, isn't it.   
 Q.  Tell me about your play today.  What did you do particularly well?  
HENRIK STENSON: I drove the ball pretty nicely.  Hit some good tee shots.  Some solid iron shots and putter was working very well on the back nine, which was my front nine.  Made some good birdie putts and a par save on the last there, and missed a couple of opportunities on 1 and 2, and then made some on 5 and 6.  So all in all, a pretty solid day.   
 Q.  How big a sense of opportunity was there out there with the weather obviously in the latter part of the round being so good?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, any day where you play a links-style golf course that's not that long with calm conditions, you always feel like you need to make some birdies.  It's certainly more target golf than links golf out there.  You might argue, it's not the practice we want for next week, but I'm happy with the way I hit a lot of shots and hit some really good putts.  We're just going to try to propel on throughout the week.   
 Q.  You haven't played since the U.S. Open.  How have you spent the time?  
HENRIK STENSON: Anything but preparing, so maybe rest is a good recipe, as well.  I've been back in Sweden with the family and enjoyed some time off.  We lifted a few weights and so on, but not many clubs.  Yeah, this is the time to gear it up for next week.   
 Q.  Six birdies, no bogeys on the card.  What pleased you most out there?  
HENRIK STENSON: I'd say some really good passes on the long game, both on the tee and into the greens.  That's the area that I feel I had to improve the most and had some positive vibes on the long stuff today and putter was behaving pretty good.  Yeah, whenever you play a round with no bogeys, you've done a few good things right.   
 Q.  Not the usual setup with respect to a Scottish Open.  How is the course playing out there?  
HENRIK STENSON: I'd say it's kind of more target golf than links golf.  It's a different design to start with.  We've got a few greens that are very busy and lots of humps and elevations.  Yeah, it's not the kind of links course where you're going to run the ball in, anyway, but it's playing fairly soft with all the rain we've had, and not much wind the guys can take advantage for sure.   
 Q.  It's been a fair while since we've seen you play in Europe.  Is it nice to be back?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's always nice to be back.  Nice to be back in Scotland.  Brings great memories back from a couple of years ago.  Yeah, we're here trying to get some momentum heading into next week at Portrush.
