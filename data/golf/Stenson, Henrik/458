Q.  How does it feel to hole the putt that wins the Ryder Cup for Europe?
HENRIK STENSON:  I didn't know that was the one, but I'm delighted to win my match, and more delighted that the team wins; that's all that matters.  The boys have played fantastic all week, and to be part of this, this is my first Ryder Cup in Ireland, in Europe, and we can give the fans -- it's just unreal.
Q.  A word for the fans?
HENRIK STENSON:  Do I need to say something?  I don't.  I mean, they've been brilliant all week, and it's just getting better and better.
