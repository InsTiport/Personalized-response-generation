  HENRIK STENSON: I was 2-down after the 12th hole, so I'm happy to get it back of course.  I was a bit lucky on 15 when he lost his ball there.  And then made some good birdies on 16 and pars on 17.  I felt like I really needed to kill that 3-iron.  It was almost over my limit, but I still managed to get it there, though.  I was in a bit of a tough spot.  I played a great pitch and unfortunately a bit too good, because it checked, can was right online, and left it four feet short.  I pulled the putt a little bit and missed that.  Yeah, that sucks, but such is life.   Q.  That's golf I guess.  Patrick Reed has been fantastic this Ryder Cup, hasn't he?  HENRIK STENSON: He's played some great golf and he didn't give me much for free today.  He made a bunch of birdies in the mid of the round and I had to wait for one or two of his mistakes and tried to push on.  But of course, I hope it's not as important as it can be, that halve there, but we'll have to wait and see I guess.   Q.  You've had a spectacular Ryder Cup, three points already, what will you do now, just support the guys on the course?  HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, we'll try to head out there and push them on and see if we can bring some more points in.
