Q.  It was a good bogey at the end?
HENRIK STENSON: That was an absolutely good bogey on the last. That was a rotten tee shot but I fought really hard and got away with it. I'm very happy with today's work as my back went on the first green and I had some problems yesterday. It went so bad that I could hardly hit a golf ball. Had some treatment on the third tee.
Q.  How did you do the back in?
HENRIK STENSON:  I sat down to look at my putting line and when I stood up, I could hardly stand up. Under the circumstances, I'm very happy that I finished off the round and kept the tournament together that way.
Q.  Was there a moment where you thought you might have to walk off?
HENRIK STENSON:  It was on the edge earlier on in the round but it got better after the treatment. It would have taken a lot for me to walk off but it could have been bogey, bogey, bogey.
Q.  What treatment did you receive?
HENRIK STENSON:  I had a bit of a manipulations and some medicine.

I'm down to play next week, so I need a bit of rest and some treatment next week.
