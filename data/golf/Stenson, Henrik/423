  Q.  Henrik, will you be the third successive Swedish winner of this event on Sunday then?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I hope so. Try and keep it in Swedish hands for another year. Don't know why it is but when the course is wet maybe it helps if you can hit the ball a  bit further. Maybe we feel at home not being  too far from Sweden.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about losing your place at the top of the Order of Merit?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I am delighted for Padraig for last week. With Sergio there was always going to be one of them that would be devastated at the end of the tournament . That's the way it goes. Padraig overtakes me and that is the natural thing. Whoever had won was always going to go past or very close to me. It is fine. We are halfway through the season and I knew I put myself in a good position early on with the win in Dubai and the Match Play but it needed a whole lot more than that to but Number One at the end of the year. I am not that far behind Padraig now and just have to get my game in shape to come up with a couple of good weeks to challenge him again.   
  
  Q.  Does it give you fresh motivation to chase rather then be chased at the top?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Form does tend to come and go and I have been playing so-so for a couple of months and you feel it is time to get things going again. Not that I haven't been trying but when you have not been playing to your standards you tend to come up with the goods and start playing better again. The last five or six years the summer has not been the best period for me. I don't know if it is down to allergies, I get hay fever, or too much golf but I am usually better in the fall and hopefully I can work it out in the future with all the Majors in the summer. Just looking at my results I have not been better than seventh or eighth in the summer months for the last couple of seasons. Eighth at Wentworth in May was my best finish for a couple of years. I think it must be the allergies as it makes you tired and it is difficult to keep going.   
  
  Q.  What will Padraig's win do for European golf?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  At least put an end to all these questions about the next European winner. I had said that Carnostie would be a great chance and Padraig would be one of the contenders, unfortunately I didn't put my fiver on him.  He is a very strong player and his mental approach, he never, never gives up and he showed that on the last. He was twice in trouble and still got up and down to give himself a chance of getting in the play-off and he did that and took the chance when he got it. He never gives up and that is his strongest asset. He keeps on going.   
  
  Q.  This week?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I know the course and we have played here a couple of times. The game is feeling better and hopefully we can have a good week. I would like to add another German title to the CV.
